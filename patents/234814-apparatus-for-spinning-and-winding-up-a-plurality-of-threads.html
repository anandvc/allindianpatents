				<td>Apparatus for spinning and winding up a plurality of<br>
synthetic threads<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for spinning and winding up a plurality of synthetic threads, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
An apparatus of the generic type is known from DE 100 45 473 Al.<br>
Known in the art, in the production of melt-spun synthetic threads, is the practice whereby, by means of a spinning device, a multiplicity of threads are extruded simultaneously by a spinning device in parallel to one another and are cooled.  Thus, for example, twelve, sixteen, twenty or yet more threads can be produced simultaneously by a spinning device.  Following cooling, the threads are guided and processed jointly, as a threadsheet.  At the end of the spinning process, each thread of the threadsheet is wound up to form a bobbin. For this purpose, a plurality of spooling units are combined to form a group, and assigned to the spinning device.  Each of the spooling units has a spooling revolver with two lengthily projecting spooling spindles, in order to render possible a process of continuous winding-up of the spun threads.  The spooling spindles can be alternately swivelled, by the spooling revolver, into an operating region for winding the threads and into a changeover region for removal of the completely wound full bobbins.<br>
In the case of the apparatus known from DE 100 45 473 Al, the group of spooling units is constituted by two spooling machines disposed adjacently to one another.  In this case,<br><br>
the spooling units are opposite one another in a mirror-image arrangement, and in the winding-up of the threads the winding operation is preferably performed synchronously in the spooling units.  The space requirement of this apparatus is therefore substantially determined by the spooling units disposed adjacently to one another.  If the threadsheet is spun in a series arrangement in the spinning device, the width of the spooling units is usually greater than the width of the spinning device, such that the division in large plants is determined by the winding units.  In large plants, however, a plurality of spinning devices are preferably supplied by one extruder, such that these spinning devices must be disposed as closely together as possible.<br>
Known from US 6,015,113 is a group of spooling units, for winding up a plurality of threadsheets, in which the spooling units are arranged above one another in the form of tiers.  It was thereby possible to reduce the division width of the spooling units, but with the disadvantage that the thread guidance prevailing in the upper spooling unit differs from that in the lower spooling unit.  Particularly in the case of the winding-up of synthetic threads at high speeds, which may be exceed 6,000 m/min., owing to the air resistance such guidance length differences in the thread guidances become evident as winding tension differences, such that bobbins, and even threads, of differing quality are produced.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the invention is to provide an apparatus, of the generic type, for spinning and winding up threads, in which apparatus the group of spooling units is disposed in a compact design and, on the other hand, the<br><br>
threads can be wound under the same conditions in each of the spooling units to form bobbins.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, by an apparatus for spinning and winding up a plurality of threads, having the features according to claim 1, and by an apparatus having the features according to claim 14.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the respective<br>
sub-claims.<br>
The invention is based on the fact that two spooling units that are realized in a mirror-image arrangement in relation to each another are disposed above one another.  It is thereby possible, on the one hand, to realize a division width of the group of spooling units which substantially corresponds to the division width of a single spooling unit.  In addition, the smaller space between the spooling spindles held in the operating regions favours a thread infeed that is realized under substantially like conditions.  By contrast, the greater distance between the spooling spindles held in the changeover region is particularly advantageous in preventing mutual hindrance in guidance and in removal of the full bobbins.  In this case, each of the spooling units is capable of simultaneously winding, respectively, a plurality of threads to form bobbins.<br>
Particularly advantageous in this case is the development<br>
of the invention wherein a thread guidance means is disposed in the mirror-symmetry plane of the spooling units, said thread guidance means deflecting the threads<br><br>
fed from the spinning device such that they are taken into the winding units.  The thread guidance is thus effected laterally between the spooling units that are disposed above one another, such that identical conditions can be realized for intake into both spooling units.<br>
The thread guidance means is preferably constituted by a rotatably mounted deflection roller, on whose circumference the threadsheet fed from the spinning device is guided.  In this case, the deflection roller may be additionally driven, in order to realize winding tensions that are as low as possible.<br>
In order to realize a division width that is as small as possible, according to an advantageous development of the invention one or more traversing means is/are disposed immediately after the thread guidance means in the thread path, which traversing means guide the threads to and fro in the individual spooling units for the purpose of winding them up to form cross-wound bobbins.  The thread guidance means thus constitutes the start of the traversing triangle directly in each winding station.<br>
In order to achieve as great a flexibility as possible in respect of the bobbin increase during winding-up, each spooling unit has a pressure roller which cooperates with the spooling spindle respectively held in the operating region.  These pressure rollers are held on a swivel arm, and the swivel arms are mounted together on a swivel axle.<br>
In order that the bearing forces acting respectively in this case between the pressure rollers and the bobbins that are to be newly wound can be kept within predefined<br><br>
Set point values or set point ranges, a force actuator and a force sensor are preferably assigned to each pressure roller.  The force sensor, together with the rotary drive of the spooling revolver, is in this case connected to a feedback-control circuit via a control device, such that the yielding motion during the increase in size of the bobbin proceeds with a bearing force that is as constant as possible.<br>
In this case, the spooling revolvers of both spooling units that are disposed above one another can also preferably be driven by a common rotary drive.<br>
If a large number of synthetic threads are to be produced simultaneously, the invention can preferably be expanded in that, at a distance from the spooling units, two further spooling units, that are disposed above one another, are assigned to the spinning device.  In this case, the spooling units disposed above one another and the spooling units disposed adjacently to one another are respectively realized in a mirror-image arrangement in relation to one another.  Thus, one of the mirror-symmetry planes runs in the centre between the lower and the upper spooling machines, and the second mirror-symmetry plane runs vertically between the spooling units, orthogonally in relation to the first mirror-symmetry plane.<br>
The thread in feed is preferably effected in the space between the spooling units, a second thread guidance means being disposed in the mirror-symmetry plane that runs horizontally.  The two thread guidance means are preceded in the thread path by a thread separator, by which the<br><br>
threads infed from the spinning device can be divided into two threadsheets.<br>
According to an advantageous development, the space between the spooling units is used to accommodate an electric unit comprising the drive electronics and the control electronics of the spooling units.  In this case, the electric unit may advantageously comprise an operator control panel, by which the entire group of spooling units can be controlled.<br>
For servicing purposes, it is advantageous in this case if the electric unit is of a movable design, such that the space between the spooling units can be used as a servicing and operator control passage.<br>
Monitoring devices, for monitoring the thread path, are advantageously disposed between the upper spooling units that are disposed adjacently to one another.  In addition to the monitoring devices, additional processing devices could also be integrated between the spooling devices, said processing devices performing, for example, intermingling of the threads to increase the thread cohesion.<br>
The spooling units are preferably held in a winding frame with closed partition walls, by means of which walls the spooling units are separated from one another and enclosed. In this case, the walls at the free end of the spooling spindles have openings through which the full bobbins can be changed.  Such enclosures thus provide for a fully climatized environment for winding up the threads to form bobbins.<br><br>
The compactness of the apparatus according to the invention can be further improved in that assigned to the group of spooling units is a further group of spooling units.  In this case, the spooling units of both groups are respectively disposed with their drive sides towards one another in a common longitudinal axis, and enclose between them a drive unit having a plurality of drives assigned to the winding units.  This renders possible, on the one hand, enclosure of the drives and, on the other hand, coupling of drives.<br>
To this extent, the apparatus according to the invention, as in claim 15, is particularly suitable for achieving the basic object.  For this purpose, the winding units disposed in a mirror-symmetrical manner are disposed in a common longitudinal axis.  A drive unit, having a plurality of drives assigned to the two winding units, is provided between the winding units that are opposite one another. Consequently, small division widths can also be realized with a compact design of the spooling units.  In particular, the fact that the drive unit is realized between the spooling units renders possible a common enclosure for all drives.<br>
Advantageously, the drive unit has at least one rotary drive, for synchronously driving the two spooling revolvers<br>
of the spooling units that are opposite one another.<br>
Likewise-, it is possible for the spooling spindles that are opposite one another in one axis to be driven by a common spindle drive.<br><br>
In order to achieve an apparatus for spinning and winding up threads that is compact also in respect of its height, the group of spooling units is preferably immediately preceded by a take-off device which has at least one takeoff godet and a drafting godet.  In this case, one of the godets is preferably designed to be adjustable between a lay-on position and an operating position, so as to provide for automated laying-on of the threads directly from the spinning device into the spooling machine.<br>
For the purpose of climatizing such apparatuses, the takeoff device is preferably accommodated in a godet box, which is connected on the intake side to a drop shaft of the spinning device and is connected on the discharge side to the winding frame with the closed walls.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention is basically suitable for the production of a variety of types of synthetic threads.  Thus, depending on the design of the take-off device, both POY and FDY threads can be produced. The concept is also basically suitable, however, for the production of elastic threads, crimped threads or industrial threads.<br>
The apparatus, according to the invention, for spinning and winding up a plurality of threads is explained more fully in the following on the basis of some exemplary embodiments and with reference to the appended figures, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1  shows, in schematic form, a view of a first<br>
exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention<br><br>
Fig. 2  shows, in schematic form, a side view of the group of spooling units of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1<br>
Fig. 3  shows, in schematic form, a view of a further<br>
exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
Fig. 4  shows, in schematic form, a top view of a group of spooling units of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
Represented schematically in Fig. 1 is a view of a first exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.  The apparatus has a spinning device 1, a takeoff device 2 8 disposed beneath the spinning device 1, and a group of spooling units 2 which comprises the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 and is disposed beneath the take-off device 28.<br>
The spinning device 1 is connected, via a melt infeed 33, to a melt source, for example an extruder, which is not represented here.  The melt infeed 3 3 leads to a spinning beam 34 which, on its underside, has a plurality of spinning nozzles 3 5 that are preferably disposed adjacently to one another in a series arrangement.  In this exemplary embodiment, the spinning nozzles 35 are disposed in a series arrangement which runs orthogonally relative to the plane of the drawing.  Further melt guidance elements, such as distribution lines and spinning pumps, are usually disposed in the spinning beam 34.<br>
Realized beneath the spinning nozzles 35 is a cooling shaft 36, which is connected to a cooling air-current<br><br>
generator (not represented here).  The cooling shaft 36 opens into a drop shaft 32.<br>
A preparation device 3 7 is assigned to the spinning device 1.  In this exemplary embodiment, the preparation device 37 is constituted by a preparation roller at the end of the drop shaft 32.<br>
The preparation device 3 7 could, however, also have a plurality of preparation units distributed along the spinning line.  Thus, a first pre-preparation, for combining a filament bundle to form a thread, is preferably already effected beneath the cooling shaft.<br>
A take-off device 2 8 is provided in order to take off from the respective spinning nozzles 35 the synthetic threads being produced in parallel in the spinning device 1.  In this exemplary embodiment, the take-off device 28 is constituted by a take-off godet 29 and a drafting godet 30, around each of which the threads are partially wound.<br>
The design of the take-off device 28 depends, basically, on the type of thread to be produced.  Thus, the take-off device 2 8 could also be constituted by godet units around which threads are wound multiply, in order to produce, for example, fully drawn threads.  Likewise, the take-off device 28 could also have a multiplicity of individual take-off feeder rollers, each of which guides only one of the threads.  Moreover, the take-off device 2 8 may include additional processing devices such as, for example, tangle mechanisms.<br><br>
The group of spooling units 2 is disposed at the end of the spinning line, to receive the produced synthetic threads.<br>
For the purpose of further explaining the group of spooling units 2, reference is also made to Fig. 2, in addition to Fig. 1.  In Fig. 2, the group of spooling units 2 is represented schematically in a side view.  To this extent, the following description applies to both figures.<br>
The group of spooling units 2 is constituted by two spooling units 2.1 and 2.2, which are disposed above one another.  The spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 are opposite one another in a mirror-symmetry arrangement, such that there extends between the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 a horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19, which is indicated as a dot-dash line.  In this case, the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 are held on a winding frame 13.  The two spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 are of identical design in respect of the design and functioning of their mechanical assemblies.  Thus, the spooling unit 2.1 has a rotatably driven spooling revolver 5.1 on which there are mounted two lengthily projecting spooling spindles 6.1 and 7.1.<br>
A spindle drive 15.1 is assigned to the spooling spindle 6.1, and a spindle drive 15.2 is assigned to the spooling spindle 7.1.  Each of the spooling spindles 6.1 and 7.1 carries a plurality of spooling tubes 39, disposed adjacently to one another, for receiving bobbins 4.  The spooling spindles 6.1 and 7.1 can be alternately swivelled by the spooling revolver 5.1 into an operating region and into a changeover region.  In the situation represented, the spooling spindle 6.1 is in the operating region and the spooling spindle 7.1 is in the changeover region.  In the<br><br>
operating region, the spooling spindle 6.1 cooperates with a rotatably mounted pressure roller 10.1.  For this purpose, the pressure roller 10.1 is held on a swivel arm 11.1, which is pivotally connected to the winding frame 13 via a swivel axle 12.1.  A force actuator 18.1 and a force sensor 17.1 are assigned to the pressure roller 10.1.  The force.sensor 17.1 is coupled to a control device 16 by means of its signal line.<br>
The control device 16 comprises the drive electronics and control electronics of all actuators and drives of the two spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.  The control device 16 is thus connected to the spindle drives 15.1 and 15.2, and to a rotary drive 14, by which the spooling revolver 5.1 is driven.<br>
The pressure roller 10.1 is preceded in the thread path by a traversing means 9.1, by which the threads that are being wound to form bobbins are respectively guided to and fro in order to produce a cross-winding for the purpose of forming the bobbins.<br>
The upper spooling unit 2.2 has identical assemblies, in mirror-symmetry relative to the horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19.  Thus, the spooling spindles 6.2 and 7.2 are held in a rotatably mounted, projecting manner on a spooling revolver 5.2.  The pressure roller 10.2 is assigned to the spooling spindle 6.2.  The pressure roller 10.2 is rotatably held on the swivel arm 11.2, the swivel arm 11.2 being likewise connected to the winding frame at the swivel axle 12.1.  For this purpose, the swivel arm 12.1 is disposed in the horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19,  The<br><br>
traversing means 9.2 is disposed before the pressure roller 10.2.<br>
Owing to the mirror-symmetrical arrangement of the lower spooling unit 2.1 in relation to the upper spooling unit 2.2, a relatively small space Si is formed between the spooling spindles 6.1 and 6.2 disposed in the operating region.  By contrast, a substantially greater space S2 exists between the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 held in the changeover region.  This design has the particular advantage that the threads can be fed centrally to the winding stations.<br>
Furthermore, no obstruction is caused as a result of guidance of the full bobbins at the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2, such that both spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 can be held in a very compact manner with a minimum spacing in relation to one another.<br>
As shown by Fig. 2, the spooling revolver 5.1 of the lower spooling unit 2.1 and the spooling revolver 5.2 of the upper spooling unit 2.2 are driven jointly by the rotary drive 14.  The spooling revolvers 5.1 and 5.2 in this case have opposing directions of rotation, and are coupled to one another through a transmission means (not represented).<br>
The threads are fed-out laterally, next to the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2, from the take-off device 28.  In this case a thread guidance means 8.1, in the form of a deflection roller by which the fed-in threads 3 are jointly<br>
deflected, is realized in the horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19.  Following deflection of the threads at the thread guidance means 8.1, the threads 3 are divided into a<br><br>
lower and an upper threadsheet and fed to the respective spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.  In this exemplary embodiment, each of the spooling units winds four threads 3 simultaneously to form bobbins 4.  Thus, eight threads in total are wound simultaneously in the upper and lower spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 to form bobbins.<br>
A monitoring device 25.1 for monitoring the thread path is disposed laterally next to the upper spooling unit.  The monitoring device 25.1 usually has one thread breakage detector per thread.<br>
In the spinning device 1, a plastic melt is first fed to the spinning beam 34 via the melt infeed 33.  The plastic melt is conveyed to the spinning nozzles 3 5 and extruded under the pressure action of a multiplicity of nozzle bores of the respective spinning nozzles 35.  For this purpose, each spinning nozzle 35 represents a multiplicity of filament skeins which, as filament bundles, are denoted by the reference 40.  The freshly extruded filament skeins are then cooled in the cooling shaft 36 by a supplied cooling medium.  Following cooling of the filament bundles 4 0 guided adjacently to one another, each of the bundles is combined to form a thread 3.  Take-off of the filament bundles 40 or threads 3 is effected by the take-off device 28.  For this purpose, the threads 3 are wound partially around the take-off godet 29 and the drafting godet 30.  The take-off godet 29 and the drafting godet 30 are each driven, a slight to large speed difference between the take-off godet 2 9 and the drafting godet 3 0 being settable, depending on the type of thread being produced. From the drafting godet 30, the threads are guided vertically to reach the thread guidance means 3.1.  The<br><br>
threads are deflected by the thread guidance means and, following division into an upper threadsheet and a lower threadsheet, reach the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.<br>
In order to explain the functioning of the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2, reference is made to Fig. 2 in addition to Fig. 1.  In the operating situation represented, the threads are each wound at the spooling spindles 6.1 and 6.2 of the two spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.<br>
During the simultaneous winding-up of the threads 3 to form bobbins 4, the pressure rollers 10.1 and 10.2 respectively bear on the circumference of the bobbins 4 wound at the spooling spindles 6.1 and 6.2.  In this case, the bearing pressure of the pressure rollers 10.1 and 10.2 is controlled through control of the force actuators 18.1 and 18.2.  In order to provide, on the one hand, for a yielding motion of the spooling spindles 6.1 and 6.2 during the increase in size of the bobbins 4, the respectively applied bearing force is measured by the force sensors 17.1 and 17.2.  Within the control device 16, the respectively predefined setpoint values are matched to the respectively measured actual values of the bearing force, such that the activation of the rotary drive for moving the spooling revolvers 5.1 and 5.2 can be effected in such a way that a constant bearing force is maintained in each case.<br>
It is also possible, however, to detect the lifting motion of the pressure rollers 10.1 and 10.2 at the swivel arms 11.1 and 11.2, in order to obtain a stepwise or continuous<br>
yielding motion of the spooling spindles through activation of the rotary drive 14.<br><br>
As soon as the bobbins at the spooling spindles 6.1 and 6.2 are fully wound, an automatic bobbin change is effected, the thread being thereupon respectively taken over by the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 for the purpose of winding new bobbins.<br>
In the case of the apparatus represented in Figs. 1 and 2, a multiplicity of threads can be produced, whilst the division width is kept as narrow as possible.  In particular, the group of spooling units 2 has a division width which is only insignificantly greater than if only one single spooling unit were used.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, in schematic form, a view of a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.  This exemplary embodiment is particularly suitable for producing a multiplicity of threads on a minimally small structural space, and for winding them to form bobbins.  The exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 3 is substantially identical to the preceding exemplary embodiment, such that reference is made to the preceding description and only the differences are explained in the following.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 3 consists of a spinning device 1, a take-off device 2 8 and a group of spooling units 2.  The spinning device 1, the take-off device 28 and the group of spooling units 2 are connected to one another through outwardly closed frame walls.  The design of the spinning device 1 is identical to that of the preceding exemplary embodiment.  Adjoining the end of the drop shaft 32 is a godet box 31.  A take-off godet 29 and a drafting godet 30 are held within the godet box 31.  The<br><br>
take-off godet 29 is movably held on a positioning device 38, in order to guide the take-off godet 2 9 between a lay-on position (indicated by a broken line) and an operating position.  The positioning device 38 in this case could be constituted by a rotor on which the take-off godet 29 or also, alternatively, both godets 29 and 30, are attached and are movable.<br>
Adjoining beneath the godet box 31 is the winding frame 13, which is constituted in each case by closed partition walls 26.  The group of spooling units 2 is held in the winding frame 13.  In this case, a total of four spooling units 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 are held in a mirror-symmetrical arrangement in relation to one another.  The lower spooling units 2.1 and 2.3 are designed to be mirror-symmetrical in relation to the upper spooling units 2.2 and 2.4.  The horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19 thus runs between the lower and the upper spooling units.  Running orthogonally thereto is a vertical mirror-symmetry plane 20, which defines the mirror-symmetry plane between the right spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 and the left spooling units 2.3 and 2.4.  The spooling units 2.1 and 2.4 are each of identical design, their design corresponding to that of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 described previously, such that reference is made to the preceding description and only the differences are described in the following.<br>
A space is formed between the right spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 and the left spooling units 2.3 and 2.4.  Disposed<br>
between the lower spooling units 2.1 and 2.3 in this case is an electric unit 2 3, which contains the control device with the control electronics and the drive electronics.<br><br>
Realized on the electric unit is an operator control panel 24, by means of which it is possible to control all spooling units 2.1 to 2.4.  The electric unit 23 is of a movable design, such that the space between the right spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 and the left spooling units 2.3 and 2.4 can be used as an operator control passage.<br>
For the purpose of thread guidance, the thread guidance means 8.1 and 8.2, in the form of two idler rollers disposed adjacently to one another in the horizontal mirror-symmetry plane 19, are held in the space between the left spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 and the right spooling units 2.3 and 2.4.  Preceding the thread guidance means 8.1 and 8.2 in the thread path is a thread separator 21, by which the threads running off the drafting godet 3 0 are divided into two threadsheets 22.1 and 22.2.  Respectively assigned to each threadsheet 22.1 and 22.2 is a monitoring device 25.1 and 25.2 located in the space between the upper spooling units 2.2 and 2.4.<br>
In the winding frame 13, the spooling units 2.1 to 2.4 are separated from one another by partition walls 26, and fully enclosed at the ends by additional partition walls.  In this exemplary embodiment, the end partition walls are indicated only in the case of the example of the spooling unit 2.4.  The front partition wall 41 in this case has a bobbin opening 42, through which the full bobbins can be changed.  During operation, the bobbin opening 42 is closed by a cover, which is not represented here.  A fully climatized environment can thus be created in the respective spooling units 2.1 to 2.4.  Guidance of the threads is effected in this case through appropriately shaped openings.<br><br>
The exemplary embodiment represented in Fig. 3 is preferably suitable for the production of POY threads.  At the start of the process, the take-off godet 29 is first swivelled into the lay-on position, such that the threadsheet dropping down out of the spinning device falls contactlessly into the thread infeed of the winding frame. In this case, for example, the threadsheet could be received by a collecting hopper having a connected suction extraction system in the lower region of the winding frame. The take-off godet 29 is then swivelled out of the lay-on position into the operating position.  Due to the fact that the threadsheet bears on the take-off godet 29 and on the drafting godet 30, the threads 3 of the threadsheet will be distributed uniformly on the circumference of the godets 29 and 30.  For the purpose of apportioning the threadsheet to the individual spooling devices, the thread separator 21 is first activated in the upper region of the winding frame 13, said separator being able to be constituted by, for example, two guide elements that engage in one another in a comb-type manner, in order thereby to achieve division of the threadsheet into a left threadsheet 22.2 and a right threadsheet 22.1.  Both threadsheets 22.1 and 22.2 are then divided, by a second auxiliary device, into respectively an upper and a lower partial threadsheet, which can be taken up by a suction extraction device respectively assigned to the spooling units.  For this purpose, the threadsheets 22.1 and 22.2 are guided by means of the thread guidance means 8.1 and 8.2 disposed at a distance from one another. The upper and lower partial threadsheets forming thereafter then go directly to the assigned spooling units 2.1 to 2.4.<br><br>
The operation of laying onto the spooling units 2.1 to 2.4 is preferably effected synchronously, such that a uniform thread guidance of all threads is achieved.  The spooling operation is effected in each of the represented spooling units 2.1 to 2.4 as in the aforementioned description relating to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1, such that no further explanation relating thereto is given at this point.  During the winding-up of the threads, the spooling units 2.1 to 2.4 may be operated both separately and synchronously.  The spooling revolvers 5.1 and 5.2, and the spooling revolvers 5.3 and 5.4, are preferably driven, respectively, by means of a common rotary drive.<br>
For the purpose of doubling the number of threads that are to be produced simultaneously, Fig. 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, only the top view of the group of spooling units 2 being shown in this case.  As compared with the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 3, the group of spooling units 2 is supplemented by spooling units respectively disposed in a mirror-image arrangement in axial extension. In this case, the drive sides of respectively two spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 are opposite one another in a mirror-image arrangement, such that a drive unit 27 is enclosed between the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.  The drive unit 27 comprises the drives of the spooling revolvers and spooling spindles of both spooling units 2.1 and 2.2.  In this case, both the drives of the spooling revolvers and the drives of the spooling spindles can be easily coupled together.  Synchronous operation of the spooling units 2.1 and 2.2 that are opposite one another in the longitudinal axis can thus be achieved in a simple manner.<br><br>
The design of the spooling units is identical to that of the previously described spooling units of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. l.<br>
The exemplary embodiment represented in Fig. 4 is particularly suitable for integrating in one installation a maximum number of apparatuses according to the invention. Thus, a total of eight spooling units may be combined to form a group.  The compact arrangement of the spooling units, with a synchronous operating method, makes it possible both for a plurality of drives of the spooling units to be jointly controllable or, also, to be combined to form one drive.  The central thread guidance of the threads, in the group of spooling units, out of the plane of symmetry or centre of symmetry enables each of the spooling units to produce identical bobbins under the same conditions.  The apparatus according to the invention is thus particularly suitable for enabling synthetic threads to be wound up at a winding-up speed of &gt; 6,000 m/min.<br>
The design of the spooling unit represented in the exemplary embodiments according to Figs. 1 to 4 is also exemplary.  Basically, all known traversing systems, such as, for example, a flyer traversing system or reversing threaded shaft traversing systems, can be used as traversing means.  Thus, the traversing means of the spooling units disposed above one another can also be advantageously combined in such a way that only one drive is required.  Likewise, the mounting of the pressure rollers is exemplary.  Thus, the pressure rollers may be held singly and independently in both a fixed and a movable manner.  The invention thus also includes similar designs<br><br>
of spooling units that are held in the special mirror-symmetrical arrangement in relation to one another.<br><br>
