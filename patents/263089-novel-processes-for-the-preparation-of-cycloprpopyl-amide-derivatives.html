formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>

During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press,<br>
1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed<br>
at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art. For<br>
example, one skilled in the art will recognize that in the processes of the<br>
 present invention, it may be necessary and / or desirable to protect substituent<br>
groups such as (C1-8 alkylcarbonyl)C1-8 alkyl.<br>

00-8), and the like; in an organic solvent such as THF, toluene, acetonitrile,<br>
and the like, preferably, THF; to yield the corresponding compound of formula<br>
(IIs).<br>
Preferably, the compound of formula (IIs) is isolated according to known<br>
methods, for example by solvent evaporation. The compound of formula (IIs)<br>
 may be further, optionally, reacted according to known methods, to yield its<br>
corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt, preferably its corresponding<br>

The compounds or compositions of the invention may be formulated and<br>
administered to a subject by any conventional route of administration,<br>
including, but not limited to, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intradermal and parenteral administration. The quantity of the compound<br>
which is effective for treating each condition may vary, and can be determined<br>
by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally additional pharmaceutical<br>
agents such as H1 antagonists or SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake<br>
Inhibitors). Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as<br><br>
pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed<br>
release and sustained release formulations), powders, granules, sterile<br>
parenteral solutions or suspensions (including syrups and emulsions), metered<br>
aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoihjector devices or<br>
suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal<br>
administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively,<br>
the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-<br>
monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound,<br>
such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for<br>
intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the<br>
principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicafcium phosphate or gums,<br>
and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid pre-formulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to<br>
these pre-formulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the<br>
active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms<br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid pre-formulation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing<br>
from 5 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
Examples include 5 mg, 7 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 35 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg,<br>
100 mg, 120 mg, 150 mg, and so on. The tablets or pills of the disclosed<br>
compositions can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage<br>
form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or<br>
pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter<br>
being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the<br>
stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or<br>
to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric<br>
layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with .<br>
such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br><br>
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the<br>
present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection<br>
include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for<br>
aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth,<br>
acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via<br>
topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a<br>
* transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be<br>
continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents<br>
and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or<br>
beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia,<br>
tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include,<br>
without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the<br>
like.<br><br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from<br>
a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or.<br>
phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon<br>
caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyoesters, polyacetals,<br>
polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block<br>
copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment is required.	.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 1<br>
to 1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions<br>
are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0, 5.0, 10.0,15.0,25.0,<br>
50.0,100,250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic<br>
adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated. An effective amount of<br>
the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to<br>
about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.02<br>
mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from about 0.05<br>
mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be<br>
administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br><br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and  .<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with<br>
the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>
The following Examples are set forth to aid in the understanding of the<br>
invention, and are not intended and should not be construed to limit in any way<br>
the invention set forth in the claims which follow thereafter.<br>
In the Examples which follow, some synthesis products are listed as<br>
having been isolated as a residue. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art that the term "residue" does not limit the physical state in which the<br>
product was isolated and may include, for example, a solid, an oil, a foam, a<br>
gum, a syrup, and the like.<br><br>
