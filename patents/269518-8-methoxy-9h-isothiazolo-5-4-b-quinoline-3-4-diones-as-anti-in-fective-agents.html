8-METHOXY-9H-ISOTHIAZOLO[5,4-B]QUINOLINE-3,4-DIONES AND RELATED COMPOUNDS AS ANTI-INFECTIVE AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention provides 8-methoxy-9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-diones and related compounds, in which the 7-position substituent is generally an N-linked heterocycloalkyl or heterocycloalkenyl substituent, which possess antimicrobial activity. Certain compounds provided herein possess potent antibacterial, antiprotozoal, or antifungal activity. Particular compounds provided herein are also potent and/or selective inhibitors of prokaryotic DNA synthesis and prokaryotic reproduction. The invention provides anti-microbial compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, containing one or more carrier, diluents, or excipients. The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing a 8-methoxy-9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-dione or related compound as the only active agent or containing a 8-methoxy-9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-dione or related compound in combination with one or more other active agent, such as one or more other antimicrobial or antifungal agent. The invention provides methods for treating or preventing microbial infections in animals by administering an effective amount of a 7-substituted-9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-dione or related compound to an animal suffering from or susceptible to microbial infection. The invention also provides methods of inhibiting microbial growth and survival by applying an effective amount of a 7-substituted-9H-isothiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline-3,4-diones or related compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Antimicrobial compounds are compounds capable of destroying or suppressing the growth or reproduction of microorganisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, mycoplasma, yeast, and fungi. The mechanisms by which antimicrobial compounds act vary. However, they are<br>
generally believed to function in one or more of the following ways: by inhibiting cell wall synthesis or repair; by altering cell wall permeability; by inhibiting protein synthesis; or by inhibiting synthesis of nucleic acids. For example, beta-lactam antibacterials inhibit the essential penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, which are responsible for cell wall synthesis. Quinolones act, at least in part, by inhibiting synthesis of DNA, thus preventing the cell from replicating.<br>
[0003] Many attempts to produce improved antimicrobials yield equivocal results. Indeed, few antimicrobials are produced that are truly clinically acceptable in terms of their spectrum of antimicrobial activity, avoidance of microbial resistance, and pharmacology. There is a continuing need for broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and a particular need for antimicrobials effective against resistant microbes.<br>
[0004] Pathogenic bacteria are known to acquire resistance via several distinct mechanisms including inactivation of the antibiotic by bacterial enzymes (e.g., beta-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillin and cephalosporins); removal of the antibiotic using efflux pumps; modification of the target of the antibiotic via mutation and genetic recombination (e.g., penicillin-resistance in Neiserria gonorrhea); and acquisition of a readily transferable gene from an external source to create a resistant target (e.g., methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus). There are certain Gram-positive pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, which are resistant to virtually all commercially available antibiotics.<br>
[0005] Resistant organisms of particular note include methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonias, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, cephalosporin-resistant aerobic gram-negative rods and imipenem- resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These organisms are significant causes of nosocomial infections and are clearly associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. The increasing numbers of elderly and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk for infection with these pathogens. Therefore, there is a large unmet medical need for the development of new antimicrobial agents. In recent years Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections have become more common, particularly in institutional and hospital settings. Up to 60% of Staphylococcus infections are attributable to<br>
methicillin resistant strains in some parts of the United States. Some MRS A strains are now resistant to both Vancomycin and Gentamicin, drugs once considered the last defense against staphylococcus infections. Thus, there is a particularly urgent need for drugs effective against MRSA strains.<br>
[0006] The utility of isothiazoloquinolines as pharmaceutical agents has been discussed in the literature. For example, Pinol, et al discussed the use of isothiazoloquinolines as medical bactericides in US Patent 5,087,621, including<br><br>

[0007] The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company discussed antimicrobial quinolones including the following compound:<br>

in published application no. US 2003008894.<br><br>
[0008] The use of isothiazoloquinoline compounds as TNF production inhibitors has also been discussed, for example by Sankyo Co., Ltd. in JP1010149, which includes the following compound<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0009] Bayer Aktiengesellschaft has discussed bicycle[3.3.0]oct-7-yl containing compounds useful for treating H. pylori infections in WO 98/26768, including<br>
isothiazoloquinolines, having the general structure shown below in which Y may be sulfur joined to the carboxamide group to form a 5-membered ring<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0010] Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has discussed the use of isothiazoloquinolines as antibacterial agents in JP 01193275, including the following carbamate-containing compound<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0011] Abbott Laboratories has discussed the use of isothiazoloquinolines as anti-neoplastic agents in US Patent No. 5,071,848 and has discussed the use of tricyclic quinolones as antibacterial agents in US 4,767,762. The Abbott compounds have hydrogen, halogen, or lower alkyl as substituents at the 6- and 8- positions of the isothiazoloquinoline core.<br>
[0012] The present invention fulfills the need for drugs effective against MRS A bacterial strains, and provides further related advantages that are disclosed herein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION CHEMICAL DESCRIPTION AND TERMINOLOGY<br>
[0031] Prior to setting forth the invention in detail, it may be helpful to provide definitions of certain terms to be used herein. Compounds of the present invention are generally described using standard nomenclature.<br>
[0032] In certain situations, the compounds of Formula I and Formula II may contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, e.g. asymmetric carbon atoms, so that the compounds can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. These compounds can be, for example, racemates or optically active forms. For compounds with two or more asymmetric elements, these compounds can additionally be mixtures of diastereomers. For compounds having asymmetric centers, it should be understood that all of the optical isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed. In addition, compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds may occur in Z- and E-forms, with all isomeric forms of the compounds being included in the present invention. In these situations, the single enantiomers, i.e., optically active forms can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can also be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column.<br>
[0033] Where a compound exists in various tautomeric forms, the invention is not limited to any one of the specific tautomers, but rather includes all tautomeric forms.<br>
[0034] The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example, and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium and isotopes of carbon include 11C, I3C, and 14C.<br>
[0035] Certain compounds are described herein using a general formula that includes variables, e.g. A1, R2, R3, R5, R6, R7, A8, and R9. Unless otherwise specified, each variable within such a formula is defined independently of other variables. Thus, if a group is said to be substituted, e.g. with 0-2 R*, then said group may be substituted with up to two R* groups and R* at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R*. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a group is substituted by an "oxo" substituent a carbonyl bond replaces two hydrogen atoms on a carbon. An "oxo" substituent on an aromatic group or heteroaromatic group destroys the aromatic character of that group, e.g. a pyridyl substituted with oxo is a pyridone.<br>
[0036] The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., =O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and subsequent formulation into an effective therapeutic agent. Unless otherwise specified substituents are named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood that when (cycloalkyl)alkyl is listed as a possible substituent the point of attachment of this substituent to the core structure is in the alkyl portion.<br>
[0037] The exception to naming substituents into the ring is when the substituted is listed with a dash ("-") or double bond ("=") that is not between two letters or symbols. In that case the dash or double bond symbol is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -CONH2 is attached through the carbon atom.<br>
[0038] As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, having the specified number of carbon atoms. Thus, the term C1-C6 alkyl as used herein includes alkyl groups having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. When C0-Cn alkyl is used herein in conjunction with another group, for example, (aryl)C0-C4 alkyl, the indicated group, in this case aryl, is either directly bound by a single covalent bond (C0), or attached by an alkyl chain having the specified number of carbon atoms, in this case from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, and sec-pentyl.<br>
[0039] "Alkenyl" as used herein, indicates a hydrocarbon chain of either a straight or branched configuration having one or more carbon-carbon double bond bonds, which may occur at any stable point along the chain. Examples of alkenyl groups include ethenyl and propenyl.<br>
[0040] "Alkynyl" as used herein, indicates a hydrocarbon chain of either a straight or branched configuration having one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain, such as ethynyl and propynyl.<br>
[0041] "Alkoxy" represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of<br>
carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, i-propoxy, n-butoxy, 2-butoxy, t-butoxy, n-pentoxy, 2-pentoxy, 3-pentoxy, isopentoxy, neopentoxy, n-hexoxy, 2-hexoxy, 3-hexoxy. and 3-methylpentoxy. An "(alkoxy)alkyl group is an alkoxy group as defined herein attached through its oxygen atom to an alkyl bridge where the point of attachment to the substituted group is in the alkyl group.<br>
[0042] "Alkanoyl" indicates an alkyl group as defined above, attached through a keto (-(C=O)-) bridge. Alkanoyl groups have the indicated number of carbon atoms, with the carbon of the keto group being included in the numbered carbon atoms. For example a C2alkanoyl group is an acetyl group having the formula CH3(C=O)-.<br>
[0043] As used herein, the terms "mono- or di-alkylamino" and "mono- and di-alkylamino" indicate secondary or tertiary alkyl amino groups, wherein the alkyl groups are as defined above and have the indicated number of carbon atoms. The point of attachment of the alkylamino group is on the nitrogen. Examples of mono- and di-alkylamino groups include ethylamino, dimethylamino, and methyl-propyl-amino. A mono- or di-(C3-C6alkyl)(Co-C4alkyl)amino group is an alkyl amino substituent in which a first alkyl group is chosen from C3-C6alkyl and an second alkyl group is chosen from C0-C4alkyl, wherein C0 indicates the absence of a second alkyl group, i.e. a mono-C3-C6alkylamino.<br>
[0044] The term "mono- or di-alkylcarbamate" indicates 1 or 2 independently chosen alkyl groups, as define above, attached through a carbamate (-O(C=O)NRR) linkage where R represents the alkyl groups. Mono-alkylcarbamate groups have the formula (-O(C=O)NHR).<br>
[0045] The term "alkylester" indicates an alkyl group as define above attached through an ester linkage. The ester linkage may be in either orientation, e.g. a group of the formula -0(C=O)alkyl or a group of the formula -(C=O)Oalkyl.<br>
[0046] The term "mono-, di-, or tri-alkylhydrazinyl" indicates from 1 to 3 independently chosen alkyl groups as defined above attached through a single-bonded nitrogen-nitrogen linkage. At least one of the alkyl groups is attached to the terminal nitrogen (the nitrogen not bound to the core structure). When the term mono- or di-alkylhydrazinyl is used only the terminal nitrogen is alkyl substituted. Examples of alkylhydrazinyl groups include 2-butyl-1-<br>
hydrazinyl, 2-butyl-2-methyl-l-hydrazinyl, and l,2-dimethyl-2-propyl-1-hydrazinyl.<br>
[0047] The term "alkylsulfonate" indicates an alkyl group as defined above attached through a sulfonate linkage (e.g. a group of the -S(=0)20-alkyl).<br>
[0048] The term "alkylthio" indicates an alkyl group as defined above attached through a sulfur linkage, i.e. a group of the formula alkyl-S-. Examples include ethylthio and pentylthio.<br>
[0049] As used herein, the term "aminoalkyl" indicates an alkyl group as defined above substituted with at least one amino substituent. Similarly, the term "hydroxyalkyl" indicates an alkyl group as defined above, substituted with at least one hydroxyl substituent. In certain instances the alkyl group of the aminoalkyl or hydroxyalkyl group may be further substituted.<br>
[0050] As used herein, the term "aryl" indicates aromatic groups containing only carbon in the aromatic ring or rings.

[0067] "Salts" of the compounds of the present invention include inorganic and organic acid and base addition salts. The salts of the present compounds can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred, where practicable. Salts of the present compounds further include solvates of the compounds and of the compound salts.<br>
[0068] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" include derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making non-toxic acid or base salts thereof, and further refers to pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of such compounds and such salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts and the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, conventional non-toxic acid salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic. sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic,<br>

[0070] The term "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of this invention means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human patient, to provide a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of a microbial infection, and or an amount sufficient to reduce the symptoms of a bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infection. In certain circumstances a patient suffering from a microbial infection may not present symptoms of being infected. Thus a therapeutically effective amount of a compound is also an amount sufficient to prevent a significant increase or significantly reduce the detectable level of microorganism or antibodies against the microorganism in the patient's blood, serum, other bodily fluids, or tissues. The invention also includes using compounds of Formula I and Formula II in prophylactic therapies. In the context of prophylactic or preventative treatment a "therapeutically effective amount" is an amount sufficient to significantly decrease the treated animal's risk of contracting a microorganism infection. A significant reduction is any detectable negative change that is statistically significant, for example statistical significance can be measured in a standard parametric test of statistical significance such as Student's T-test, where p

[0167] Certain compounds of Formula I and Formula II possess potent antibacterial, antifungal, and/or aritiprotozoal activity. Particular compounds of the invention exhibit Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of 64 µg/ ml or less against Staphyloccocus aureus and/ or Eschericia coli in a standard assay for determining the MIC of a compound against these bacteria, such as the assay provided in Example 9 below. Preferred compounds of the Formula I and II exhibit MIC values of 10 ug/ ml or less against Staphyloccocus aureus and/ or Eschericia coli.

[0169] Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory it is believed that the antimicrobial properties of compounds of Formula I and Formula II are due to the ability to these compounds to inhibit the activity of microbial DNA gyrases while having little or no effect on the analogous enzyme, topoisomerase II, present in higher organisms. Certain preferred compound of the invention are 100-fold or more selective for bacterial DNA gyrases than for mammalian, particularly human, topoisomerase II.<br>
COMPOUNDS WITH INCREASED THERAPEUTIC RANGE<br>
[0170] It has been unexpectedly discovered that substitution of compounds of Formula I<br>
and Formula II with a methoxy substituent at the Rg position increases the anti-microbial activity of the compound against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria while at the same time decreasing the cellular toxicity of the compound. The simultaneous increase in compound activity and decrease in compound toxicity provides a greater therapeutic range for compounds of Formula I and Formula II in which R8 is methoxy; i.e. the range of doses of such compounds that will produce beneficial effects without harmful side effects is increased, Anti-microbial activity is determined using a standard assay for determining the MIC of a compound against a methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria, such as the assay provided in Example 9 below. Therapeutic range is determined using a standard assay of cytotoxcity such as the Alamar blue assay provided in Example 10.<br>

Furthermore compounds of the invention may be used to treat a variety of conditions not attributed to bacterial infections. These include diseases and disorders caused fungal infections, mycoplasma infections, protozoal infections, or other conditions involving infectious organisms.<br>
[0212] In some circumstances an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or Formula II may be an amount sufficient to reduce the symptoms of the microorganism infection. Alternatively an effective amount of a Compound of Formula I may be an amount sufficient to significantly reduce the amount of microorganism or antibodies against the detectable in a patient's tissues or bodily fluids.<br>
[0213] Methods of treatment also include inhibiting microorganism replication in vivo, in an animal at risk for a microorganism infection or suffering from such an infection, by administering a sufficient concentration of a compound of Formula I or Formula II to inhibit bacterial survival in vitro. By "sufficient concentration" of a compound administered to the patient is meant the concentration of the compound available in the animal's system to prevent or combat the infection. Such a concentration by be ascertained experimentally, for example by assaying blood concentration of the compound, or theoretically, by calculating bioavailability. The amount of a compound sufficient to inhibit bacterial survival in vitro may be determined with a conventional assay for bacterial survival such as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay disclosed in Example 9, which follows.<br>
[0214] The invention also includes using compounds of Formula I and Formula I in prophylactic therapies. In the context of prophylactic or preventative treatment an effective amount of a compound of the invention is an amount sufficient to significantly decrease the treated animal's risk of contracting a microorganism infection.<br>
[0215] Compounds of the invention are particularly useful for treating and preventing infectious disorders. These include for example: ocular infections such as conjunctivitis; urinary tract and genital infections, such as complicated urinary tract infections, acute urinary tract and<br>
genital infections, such as pyelonephritis, cervical gonococcal infections, cystitis, urethral chlamydial infections, cervical chlamydial infections, urethral gonococcal infections, and prostatitis, respiratory infections, such as lower respiratory tract infections, acute sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia, skin infections, such as skin-structure infections, impetigo, folliculitis, boils, scalded skin syndrome, and cellulites, and other infections such as bone infections, joint infections, infectious diarrhea, typhoid fever, mtra-abdominal infections, gynecologic infections, including toxic shock syndrome, pelvic infections, and post-surgical infections.<br>

[0230] It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out standard manipulations of organic compounds without further direction.<br>
[0231] The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when other functionalities are masked or protected in the compound, thus increasing the yield of the reaction and/or avoiding any undesirable side reactions. Often, the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well within the scope of the skilled artisan.<br>
[0232] The compounds of the invention may have one or more chiral center. As a result, one may selectively prepare one optical isomer, including diastereomers and enantiomers, over another, for example by chiral starting materials, catalysts or solvents, or may prepare both stereoisomers or both optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers at once (a racemic mixture). Since the compounds of the invention may exist as racemic mixtures, mixtures of optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, or stereoisomers may be separated using known methods, such as through the use of, for example, chiral salts and chiral chromatography.<br>
[0233] In addition, it is recognized that one optical isomer, including a diastereomer and enantiomer, or a stereoisomer, may have favorable properties over the other. When a racemic mixture is discussed herein, it is clearly contemplated to include both optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, or one stereoisomer substantially free of the other.<br>

Step 1. Synthesis of 2,4-difluoro-3~methoxybenzoic acid (G).<br>
[0249] Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is formed by dropwise addition of n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexanes, 39 mL, 62 mmol) to a stirred solution of diisopropylamine (9.1 mL, 65 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (120 mL) at -78 °C. The resulting solution is stirred at -78 °C for 5 min, -20 °C for 15 min, and then cooled again to -78 °C. This solution of LDA is added dropwise to a cooled (-78 °C) solution of l,3-difluoro-2-methoxybenzene (7.15 g, 50 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) over a period of 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to -20 °C, cooled to -78 °C, and bubbled with carbon dioxide gas for -30 min. The resulting mixture is acidified to pH ~2 by addition of a 2 M aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and the product is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining residue is suspended in water (80 mL). The residue dissolved once the solution is adjusted to pH ~9 via addition of a 2 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. This solution is washed with diethyl ether (2 x 30 mL) and acidified slowly to pH ~2 by addition of a 2 M aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 200 mL), and the combined organic extracts are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give G as a pale yellow solid.

EXAMPLE 9. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS<br>
[0273] The antimicrobial activity of the compounds of the invention may be evaluated by a number of methods, including the following visual minimum inhibitor}' concentration (MIC) assay. This assay determines the minimum concentration of compound required to inhibit growth of a bacterial strain.<br>
MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION (MIC) ASSAY<br>
[0274] Whole-cell antibacterial activity is determined by broth microdilution using conditions recommended by the NCCLS (see National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. 2001. Performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: 11th informational supplement. Vol. 21, no. 1, M100-S11. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA). Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:50 in Mueller-Hinton II broth (Becton-Dickinson) to produce a 256 fig/ml stock solution. In a 96-well microtiter plate, the compound solution is serially two-fold diluted in Mueller-Hinton II broth. After the compounds are diluted, a 50 jal aliquot of the test organism (~1 x 106 cfu/mL) is added to each well of the microtiter plate. The final test concentrations ranges from 0.125-128 ug/mL. Inoculated plates are incubated in ambient air at 37°C for 18 to 24 hours. The organisms selected for testing included laboratory strains S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. coli ATCC 25922 (strains purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), S. aureus FQR700699, and Paeruginosa 27853. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is determined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited visible growth of the test organism.<br>
Compounds 17-46,49, and 52-113 were tested in this assay for anti-microbial activity against S. Aureus. Compounds 17-42, 44-46, 49, 52-83, 85-103, and 105-113 exhibited MIC values of 1 microgram/ ml or less against S. Aureus. Certain of these compounds exhibited an MIC value of 0.1 microgram/ ml or less against S. Aureus, and certain of these compounds also exhibited an MIC value of 0.01 microgram/ ml against S. Aureus when tested in this assay. Compounds 17, 20, 22, 38-46, 49, and 52-113 were tested in this assay for anti-microbial activity against Methicillin Resistant S. Aureus. Compounds 42, 52-57, 59, 63, 66-67, 70-71, 73-77, 87-89, 92-95, 100, 102-103, 107-108, and 111-112 exhibited MIC values of 1 microgram/ml or [ess<br>
against Methicillin Resistant S. Aureus. Compounds 17-22, 26-46, 49, 52-58, 63, 67-68, 70-90, 93-95, and 100-106 were also tested in this assay for anti-microbial activity against E. coli. Compounds 17-22, 26-42, 44-46, 49, 52-58, 63, 67-68, 70-90, 93-95, 100-103, and 105-106 exhibited MIC values of 1 microgram/ ml or less against E. coli.<br>
EXAMPLE 10. CELL VIABILITY STAINING WITH ALAMAR BLUE<br>
[0275] To determine whether the microcidal effect observed against 5". aureus and E. coli is specific to bacterial cells, compounds are screened for cell viability effects on several human cell types.<br>
[0276] Optimal cell density is first determined by plating cells in a 96-well plate standard sterile tissue culture plates in 100 ul media, 10%FBS at six cell densities from 500 cells/ well to 15,000 cells/ well. A cell free well containing only media is used as a control. Cells are incubated at 37 oC in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours. 10% culture volume (10ul) of Alamar Blue (Biosource, DAL1100, 100mL) is then added. Cells are incubated at 37 oC in a 5% CO2 incubator and read in a Victor V plate reader, 544nm excitation, 590nm emission, at 3, 4, and 24 hours after the addition of Alamar Blue.   The cell number vs. change in fluorescence is plotted to determine linearity of signal vs. cell number. The optimal density varies between 500-15,000 cells/well depending on the specific cell type. The optimal density is selected based on the highest number of cells that is still in the linear response range. Determination of Compound Cytotoxicity<br>
[0277] Cells are plated at optimal cell density in a standard sterile tissue culture 96 well plate, and incubated at 37 °C 0/N in a 5% CO2 incubator. 12 to 48 hours post-plating media is removed. The cells are washed 1 or 2 times with IX PBS and replaced with fresh media containing the test compound in 1 % DMSO. 24 to 72 hours after addition of compound, the media is removed, and the cells washed 1 to 2 times with IX PBS.   Fresh media containing 1/10 volume of Alamar Blue is then added. Plates are incubated 4 hours at 37 oC in a 5% CO2 incubator and read in a Victor V plate reader, 544 nm excitation, 590 nm emission.<br>
[0278] Compounds are diluted to 20 micromolar in 1% DMSO and media and screened in duplicate to obtain single concentration cytotoxicity data. Eight concentration points from<br>
0.78 micromolar to 100 micromolar, run in duplicate, are used to determine cyctotoxicity CC50 values. Cells with 1% DMSO and media are used as a negative control, compounds having a known CC50 against a particular cell type are used as positive controls.<br>
[0279] The change in fluorescence vs. concentration of test compound is plotted to determine the cytotoxicity of the compound.<br>
[0280] Sample media conditions, optimal plating densities, and positive control compounds for two cell types screened are presented in Table III.<br>
[0281] Certain compounds disclosed in Examples 1 to 8 exhibit CC50 values greater than 10 uM against each of the cell lines listed below. Other cell types that may be used include but are not limited to Balb/3TC, CEM-SS, HeLa, Hep2, HepG2, HT-29, MRC-5, SK-N-SH, U-87 MG, 293T, and Huh-7. More preferred are compounds with a CC50 value greater than 50 uM. Most preferred are compounds with a CC50 value greater than 100 uM. TABLE III<br>
