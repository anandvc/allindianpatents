				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a solid titanium catalyst component used as a catalyst component for preparing olefin (co)polymers, a process for preparing the catalyst component, an olefin polymerization catalyst containing the catalyst component and an olefin polymerization process using the catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catalysts containing titanium compounds supported on active magnesium halides have hitherto been known as those used for preparing homopolymers of α-olefins or olefin copolymers such as ethylene/α-olefin copolymers.  As the olefin polymerization catalysts, those comprising a solid titanium catalyst component consisting of magnesium, titanium, halogen and an electron donor and an organometallic compound catalyst component are known.<br>
It is also known that when the solid titanium catalyst component containing magnesium, titanium, halogen and an electron donor as its essential ingredients is used in the polymerization of a-olefins of 3 or more carbon atoms,<br><br>
polymers of high stereoregularity can be obtained in high yields.<br>
For preparing the solid titanium catalyst component, there is known, for example, a process wherein a hydrocarbon solution of a halogen-containing magnesium compound is contacted with a liquid titanium compound to form a solid product or a process wherein a hydrocarbon solution of a magnesium halide compound and a titanium compound is prepared and then a solid product is formed in the presence of an electron donor.<br>
As described above, many proposals relating to processes for preparing solid titanium catalyst components have been made, but studies of the properties of the resulting solid titanium catalyst components have been scarcely made.<br>
Under such circumstances as mentioned above, the present inventors studied to obtain a solid titanium catalyst component by the use of which olefin (co)polymers of high stereoregularity can be obtained with high polymerization activity.  As a result, they have found that an olefin polymerization catalyst, which contains a solid titanium catalyst component having a specific microcrystalline size (size of microcrystals of magnesium halide constituting the solid titanium catalyst component), a specific volume of pores having a radius of not more than 0.1 µm, a specific volume of pores having a radius of 0.1 to 7.5 µm and a specific mean catalyst particle diameter, can prepare olefin (co)polymers with high polymerization<br><br>
activity.  Moreover, they have also found that when α-olefins of 3 or more carbon atoms are polymerized in the presence of the catalyst, olefin (co)polymers of high stereoregularity can be obtained.  Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The solid titanium catalyst component for olefin polymerization, the process for preparing the catalyst component, the olefin polymerization catalyst containing the catalyst component and the olefin polymerization process using the catalyst according to the invention are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The meaning of the term "polymerization" used herein is not limited to "homopolymerization" but may comprehend "copolymerization".  Also, the meaning of the term "polymer" used herein is not limited to "homopolymer" but may comprehend "copolymer".<br><br>
(Solid titanium catalyst component)<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component for olefin polymerization according to the invention contains titanium, magnesium and halogen as its essential ingredients.<br>
In the solid titanium catalyst component for olefin polymerization,<br>
titanium is contained in an amount of 0.3 to 10 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 8 % by weight, more preferably 0.8 to 6 % by weight, still more preferably 1 to 5 % by weight,<br>

halogen is contained in an amount of 30 to 75 % by weight, preferably 35 to 75 % by weight, more preferably 38 to 72 % by weight, still more preferably 40 to 70 % by weight.<br>
It is preferable that the solid titanium catalyst component of the invention further contains an electron donor in addition to the essential ingredients of titanium, magnesium and halogen.

The electron donor is, for example, the later-described electron donor (a).  Above all, a diether compound having a fluorene ring, that is represented by the formula (i) , is preferable.<br>
The composition of the solid titanium catalyst component is determined in the following manner.  The solid titanium catalyst component is sufficiently washed with a large amount of hexane and dried for not shorter than 2 hours under the conditions of 0.1 to I Torr and room temperature.  Then, the solid component is measured by means of ICP (atomic absorption spectrometry), GC (gas chromatography) or the like.<br>
In the solid titanium catalyst component of the invention, the microcrystalline size of magnesium halide (microcystals) constititing the catalyst component, as calculated from peak of the (110) face measured by X-ray diffractometry of the magnesium halide, is in the range of 3 to 100 Å, preferably 5 to 80 Å, more preferably 10 to 40 Å, still more preferably 10 to 30 Å.<br>
When the microcrystalline size is much smaller than 3 Å, the particle shape of the catalyst becomes worse and the apparent bulk density of the resulting olefin (co)polymer is sometimes lowered.<br>
When the microcrystalline size is much larger than 100 Å, decrease of polymerization activity or lowering of stereoregularity of the resulting olefin (co)polymer may occur.<br><br>

When the volume of pores having a radius of not more than 0.1μm is much larger than 0.20 cm3/g, decrease of polymerization activity or lowering of stereoregularity of the resulting olefin (co)polymer may occur.<br>

The mean particle diameter (volume standard) of the solid titanium catalyst component of the invention, as measured by a light transmission sedimentation method, is in the range of 0.5 to 80 μm, preferably 3 to 70 μm, more preferably 3 to 35 μm.<br>
When the mean catalyst particle diameter is much smaller than 0.5 μm, the resulting olefin (co)polymer sometimes contains a fine powder.<br>
The microcrystalline size, the volume of pores and the mean catalyst particle diameter are measured in the following ways.<br><br>
Microcrystalline size<br>
The microcrystalline size was determined by measuring a half-value width (FWHM) of the (110) face by means of an X-ray diffractometer (RU-300 manufactured by Rigaku Denki Co.) and applying the obtained value to the known Scherrer's formula (0.9 in the formula returns to a constant K).  The samples used in the measurement of the microcrystalline size were all handled in a nitrogen atmosphere.  The measurement of the microcrystalline size using the Scherrer's formula is described in detail in "Elements of X-ray Diffractometry by D.B. Cullity" (translated by Gentaro Matsumura) published by Agne Co.<br>
Volume of pores<br>
About 0.3 g of a sample for measurig pore volume was accurately weighed and introduced into a measuring cell. After the cell was degassed (to about 0.7 Pa), mercury was poured into the cell, and the cell was mounted on a device to measure the pore volume.  The measuring conditions are as follows.<br>
Measuring device: Porosimeter 2000, manufactured by Carloelva Co.<br>
Measuring pressure range: about 1,000 kPa to. 190 MPa<br>
Measuring mode: pressurizing process within the above pressure range<br>
Cell volume: 15 cm3<br>
Mean catalyst particle diameter (volume standard)<br><br>
Measurement of the mean catalyst particle diameter was carried out by a light transmission sedimentation method. In the measurement, an automatic particle distribution measuring device of CAPA-300 model (manufactured by Horiba Co.) was used, and the main particle deameter was calculated by applying the obtained values to the known Stokes' formula as shown below.  A mixed liquid of decalin and triolein (decalin/triolein = 4/1 by weight) was used as a dispersant.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
D: particle diameter (cm)<br>
ηo: viscosity coefficient of dispersant (p)<br>
p: density of sample (g/cm3)<br>
p0: density of dispersant (g/cm3)<br>
t: sedimentation time (sec)<br>
X1: distance from the center of rotation to the<br>
sedimentation surface X2: distance from the center of rotation to the<br>
measuring surface ω: angular velocity (rad/sec)<br>

EXAMPLE<br><br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples, but it should be construed that the invention is in no way limited to those examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of solid titanium catalyst component (A)<br>
47.7 g of anhydrous magnesium chloride, 235 ml of purified toluene and 195.3 g of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol were heated at 120 °C under reflux for 3 hours to give a homogeneous solution.  To the solution was added 19.1 g of 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene having the below-described structure, and they were mixed by stirring at 120 °C under reflux for 1 hour to completely dissolve the 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene in the solution.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The resulting homogeneous solution was cooled to room temperature.  Then, to 80 ml of titanium tetrachloride maintained at -20 °C, 30 ml of the homogeneous solution was dropwise added over a period of 20 minutes.  After the addition was completed, the temperature of the mixed solution was raised to 110 °C over a period of 4 hours and then stirred at this temperature for 2 hours.<br><br>
After the 2-hour reaction was completed, the resulting solid was recovered by hot filtration and resuspended in 110 ml of titanium tetrachloride.  The suspension was again heated up to 110 °C with stirring, and thermal reaction was run for 2 hours.<br>
After the reaction was completed, the resulting solid was again recovered by hot filtration.  The solid was washed with decane at 110 °C and then further washed sufficiently with hexane at room temperature until any titanium compound liberated in the washing liquid was not detected.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (A) obtained by the above process was stored as a decane slurry, while a part of the slurry was dried to examine the catalyst composition.<br>
With respect to the solid titanium catalyst component (A), the microcrystalline size was 26 A, the volume of pores having a radius of not more than 0.1 µm was 0.002 cm3/g, the volume of pores having a radius of 0.1 to 7.5 µm was 0.560 cm3/g, and the mean catalyst particle diameter, as measured by a light transmission sedimentation method, was 11.2µm.  In the solid titanium catalyst component (A), 4.7 % by weight of titanium, 54 % by weight of chlorine, 15 % by weight of magnesium and 16.2 % by weight of 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene were contained.<br>
Polymerization<br><br>
Into a 1-liter autoclave, 400 ml of purified n-heptane was introduced.  Then, 0.4 mmol of triethylaluminum, 0.04 mmol of cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane and 0.004 mmol (in terms of titanium atom) of the solid titanium catalyst component (A) were fed to the autoclave at 6 °C in a propylene atmosphere.<br>
Further, 75 ml of hydrogen was fed at 60 °C.  The temperature of the system was raised to 70 °C and maintained at this temperature for 1 hour to preform polymerization of propylene.  The pressure during the polymerization was kept at 5 kg/cm2-G.<br>
After the polymerization was completed, the slurry containing a solid produced was filtered to separate the slurry into a white powder and a liquid phase portion.<br>
The yield of the white powder polymer after dried was 90.5 g, and the boiling heptane extraction residue of this polymer (I.I.) was 98.74 %.  Further, the polymer had MFR of 3.5 g/10 min and an apparent bulk density of 0.41 g/cm3. On the other hand, concentration of the liquid phase portion resulted in 0.2 g of a solvent-soluble polymer. Therefore, the activity was 22,700 g-PP/mmol-Ti, and it was 21,700 g-PP/g-catalyst.  The boiling heptane extraction residue of the whole polymer obtained (t-I.I.) was 98.5 %.<br>

Preparation of solid titanium catalyst component (B)<br>
95.3 g of anhydrous magnesium chloride, 485 ml of decane and 390.6 g of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol were heated at<br><br>
140 °C for 3 hours to give a homogeneous solution.  To the solution was added 22.2 g of phthalic anhydride, and they were mixed by stirring at 130 °C for 1 hour to dissolve the phthalic anhydride in the solution.<br>
The resulting homogeneous solution was cooled to room temperature.  Then, to 80 ml of titanium tetrachloride maintained at -20 °C, 30 ml of the homogeneous solution was dropwise added over a period of 20 minutes.  After the addition was completed, the temperature of the mixed solution was raised to 110 °C over a period of 4 hours. When the temperature reached 110 °C, 1.91 g of 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene previously dissolved in toluene was added to the mixed solution, and then they were reacted at this temperature for 2 hours with stirring.<br>
After the 2-hour reaction was completed, the resulting solid was recovered by hot filtration and resuspended in 110 ml of titanium tetrachloride.  The suspension was again heated up to 110 °C with stirring, and thermal reaction was run for 2 hours.<br>
After the reaction was completed, the resulting solid was again recovered by hot filtration.  The solid was sufficiently washed with decane at 110 °C and then with hexane until any titanium compound liberated in the washing liquid was not detected.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (B) obtained by the above process was stored as a decane slurry, while a part of slurry was dried to examine the catalyst composition.<br><br>
With respect to the solid titanium catalyst component<br>
(B), the microcrystalline size was 46 A, the volume of pores having a radius of not more than 0.1µm was 0.128 cm3/g, the volume of pores having a radius of 0.1 to 7.5µm. was 0.431 cm3/g, and the mean catalyst particle diameter, as measured by a light transmission sedimentation method, was 12.1µm.  In the solid titanium catalyst component (B) , 2.5 % by weight of titanium, 60 % by weight of chlorine, 18 % by weight of magnesium and 8.6 % by weight of 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene were contained.<br>
Polymerization<br>
Polymerization of propylene was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the solid titanium catalyst component (B) was used in place of the solid titanium catalyst component (A).<br>
The yield of the white powder polymer after dried was 89.3 g, and the boiling heptane extraction residue of this polymer (I.I.) was 98.33 %.  Further, the polymer had MFR of 5.1 g/10 min and an apparent bulk density of 0.38 g/cm3. On the other hand, concentration of the liquid phase portion resulted in 1.0 g of a solvent-soluble polymer. Therefore, the activity was 22,600 g-PP/mmol-Ti, and it was 11,800 g-PP/g-catalyst.  The boiling heptane extraction residue of the whole polymer obtained (t-I.I.) was 97.3 %.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
Preparation of solid titanium catalyst component (C)<br><br>
95.3 g of anhydrous magnesium chloride, 485 ml of decane and 390.6 "g of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol were heated at 140 °C for 2 hours to give a homogeneous solution.  To the solution was added 34.6 ml of 2-isopropyl-2-isobutyl-l,3-dimethoxypropane having the below-described structure, and they were mixed by stirring at 130 °C for 1 hour.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The resulting homogeneous solution was cooled to room temperature.  Then, to 80 ml of titanium tetrachloride maintained at -20 °C, 30 ml of the homogeneous solution was dropwise added over a period of 20 minutes.  After the addition was completed, to the solution was further added 7.5 ml of methyl hydrogenpolysiloxane.  Then, the temperature of the mixed solution was raised to 110 °C over a period of 4 hours and stirred at this temperature for 2 hours.<br>
After the 2-hour reaction was completed, the resulting solid was recovered by hot filtration and resuspended in 110 ml of titanium tetrachloride.  The suspension was again heated up to 110 °C with stirring, and thermal reaction was run for 2 hours.<br><br>
After the reaction was completed, the resulting solid was again recovered by hot filtration.  The solid was washed with decane at 110 °C and then further washed sufficiently with hexane at room temperature until any titanium compound liberated in the washing liquid was not detected.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (C) obtained by the above process was stored as a decane slurry, while a part of the slurry was dried to examine the catalyst composition.<br>
With respect to the solid titanium catalyst component (C), the microcrystalline size was 153 A, the volume of pores having a radius of not more than 0.1 pm was 0.179 cm3/g, the volume of pores having a radius of 0.1 to 7.5 fim was 0.383 cm3/g, and the mean catalyst particle diameter, as measured by a light transmission sedimentation method, was 13.6 µm.  In the solid titanium catalyst component (C) , 19.0 % by weight of titanium, 53 % by weight of chlorine, 6 % by weight of magnesium and 5.8 % by weight of 2-isopropyl-2-isobutyl-l,3-dimethoxypropane were contained.<br>
Polymerization<br>
Polymerization of propylene was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the solid titanium catalyst component (C) was used in place of the solid titanium catalyst component (A).<br><br>
After the polymerization was completed, the slurry containing a solid produced was filtered to separate the slurry into a white powder and a liquid phase portion.<br>
The yield of the white powder polymer after dried was 3.2 g, and the boiling heptane extraction residue of this polymer (I.I.) was 96.23 %.  Further, the polymer had a melt flow rate (MFR) of 7.8 g/10 min and an apparent bulk density of 0.26 g/cm3.  On the other hand, concentration of the liquid phase portion resulted in 0.1 g of a solvent-soluble polymer.  Therefore, the activity was 800 g-PP/mmol-Ti, and it was 3,300 g-PP/g-catalyst.  The boiling heptane extraction residue of the whole polymer obtained (t-I.I.) was 93.3 %.<br>
