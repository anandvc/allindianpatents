				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of Multi Function Peripheral's (MFP's). More particularly the present invention relates to a method of configuring various features available in an MFP.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br><br>
Multi functional peripheral (MFP) is a device which performs various operations like copying, printing, scanning etc., For configuring the features in the MFP , the user can be provided with an interactive help utility that guides the user through the configuration steps involved in accessing the potentially complex feature Wizards are often implemented as a sequence of dialog boxes which the user can move forward and backward through, filling in the details required. The implication is that the expertise of a human wizard in one of the above senses is encapsulated in the software wizard, allowing the average user to perform expertly.<br><br>
US 20030058266A1 describes a method to provide help information for features available on a multi-function office device. A user of the device can access a help module with an icon-based help mode present on the GUI of the device. The user may select an icon to invoke a link to step-by-step instructions that explain the steps to use the function associated with the icon.<br><br>
US 6222539B1 describes an extended help feature for an image forming device. A help button is provided which is geographically located on the right-side of the control panel of the image forming device. The help button is in the form of a rocker switch which can be used for scrolling through lengthy help messages. If help is available for a particular feature, depressing this help button results in the help message being displayed. The invention thus provides sequential step-by-step instructions to guide a user regarding the features available on the device.<br><br>
However none of the above mentioned patent publications explicitly mention the concept of providing help topics for specifically configuring complex features in the MFP like Scan2Email, NetScan, etc. Further the concept of generating a report after the termination of sequence of help instructions has not been identified in the above mentioned patent publications.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The invention relates to the field of Multi Functional Peripherals (MFPs) . In particular, the present invention provides a help wizard to configure various complex features available in a MFP. A direct key is provided on the control panel or a menu for accessing the help wizard. Once a user presses the direct key, the user is presented with a list of different configuration options for complex features in the MFP like Scan2Email, Netscan, Fax, etc.<br><br>
When a particular feature is selected from the above list, the help wizard displays a sequence of help screens associated with the selected feature. The method according to the present invention displays the actual movement of menu, then submenus and the way of entering the values. This gives a clear idea about the various steps involved in the complete configuration for the selected feature. Once the help wizard starts, the menu movement (movement of each help screen) will be based on some delay and it does not ask for any User intervention till it completes. After the help wizard gets completed, a test result will be provided in the form of a printed report or through E-mail.<br><br>
Accordingly  the  invention  explains  a  method  of configuring  various features available in an MFP comprising the steps of.<br><br>
providing a direct key on control panel or a menu of the MFP for accessing a configuration wizard for a user;<br><br>
presenting the user with a list of different configuration options for the various features on triggering the key or the menu;<br><br>
selecting a particular feature from the list by the user; and<br><br>
displaying sequence of help screens associated with the selected feature;<br><br>
whereby the help screens provide information on data elements which the user inputs for performing the configuration.<br><br>
After the sequence of help screens are terminated, the method provides a test report. The help screens provide the actual movement of menus, associated submenus and the way of entering the data elements. The display starts from a main menu, then moves to the associated submenus and finally fills the required data element. Screens are associated with appropriate delays in between each movement of menus. The test report is a printed report or an E-mail based report.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure 1 depicts a Functional Block diagram for the said invention<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts Flow Chart for Configuration key Operation<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br><br>
The present invention is basically a configuration wizard, which reduces the complexity of the configuration process involved in configuring the various complex features in MFP like scan2Email, Netscan etc, by guiding the user through the various configuration steps involved in configuring the particular feature.<br><br>
A MFP supporting various features like Scan2Email, Netscan etc, has lot of Menus and each menu contains lot of submenus for configuring a particular feature. To use/configure one particular feature, there is no need to navigate through all the menus and submenus. Only few menus and submenus need to be configured but it is difficult to find and fill the required information on that submenu.<br><br>
Let us consider the Scan to Email feature in MFP. This requires configuration of SMTP Server IP, Auth user name, login id, password &amp; email address, enabling and disabling of auth user setup etc. When the scanned documents are being sent to destination address then there will be a need to provide login name if auth user enabled or from address if auth user disabled, destination address, mail subject and file format. The above mentioned configuration and the steps need to be followed for the scan to email operation takes a long time for a new user to understand. The configuration wizard provides useful information pertaining to the steps involved in configuring the various features of a MFP like Scan2Email, NetScan, Scan to FTP etc.<br><br>
Once the Feature to be configured is selected, the display starts from the main menu, then moves to the respective submenus and finally fills the required information and returns back to initial one. Again it moves to other menus, submenus and fills the information. Similarly as mentioned above. it traverses and configures the required data and completes the configuration settings for the selected feature. The help screens will be associated with appropriate delays in between each menu's movement. Finally a test result will be provided in the form of a printed report or through E-mail to indicate the completion of the help wizard. The wizard also provides steps to be followed to use or operate the Configured feature.<br><br>
The steps need to be followed for implementing the said method are:<br><br>
Step1: A direct key called configuration key has to be provided in the MFP.<br><br>
Step2: If configuration key is pressed from the MFP, it has to show various configuration <br>
options for features like Scan to Email, Netscan, Fax etc.<br><br>
Step3: If any one of the above options is selected from the menu. It has to initiate the configuration wizard.<br><br>
Step4: Configuration wizard has to flow through the various steps involved in the configuration of particular feature of the MFP.<br><br>
Step5: At the end, the wizard provides for a report to be generated The same set of steps is followed for other features in MFP.<br><br>
The operation of the present invention can be explained as follows<br><br>
Press configuration key<br><br>
•   Displays different Menus as below:<br><br>
1.	configuration for Scan to Email<br><br>
2.	configuration for Netscan<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
n. configuration for Fax<br><br>
•	Select any one of the option from the menu.<br><br>
•	It shows demo for the user about the configuration requires for selected feature<br><br>
•	Ends with final result through a report<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the functional block diagram for the method of configuration wizard for MFP. As shown in figure a direct key Called configuration key is provided in the MFP. The configuration key allows the user to directly access the configuration wizard without the need for navigating through the machine key. When the user requires help wizard for configuring a particular feature, on pressing the configuration key the method displays the menu containing the demos for various features in the MFP. When a particular feature is selected from the main menu, the method then guides the user through the various sub menus. As shown in figure if the user needs help in configuring scan2Email feature in the MFP, the said feature is selected from the 'main menu for demos', the method will then show the associated sub menus for configuring the scan2Email feature.<br><br>
These sub menus include help screen for configuring the Sys.Admin Tools,E-mail setup, SMTP server set up, SMTP server IP etc,. Each help screen will be associated with a certain delay, at the end of which the user enters the desired value. After configuring the feature, to avail the feature again the user has to enter information like login name, login password, sender details, receiver details etc,. These sub menus will also be displayed in the configuration wizard. Once all the values are entered the user can avail the configured feature (here Scan2Email). Figure 2 shows the flowchart for the operation of the configuration key. As shown the method first displays the main menu containing demos for the various features in the MFP like demo for scan to Email, Demo for Netscan, Demo for fax etc,. When a particular feature is selected from the main menu, the method displays the different fields (sub-menus) that need to be entered for availing the particular feature. This is associated with help screens, which guide the user to navigate through all the fields by entering the appropriate values in the respective fields. Figure 2 shows the sub menus associated with the demo for features like scan to Email, NetScan. Once the appropriate values are configured the user can avail the same feature provided by the MFP.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br><br>
