				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for obtaining bioactive hexane fraction of the plant Vetiveria zizanioides commonly found in India for inhibiting the growth of drug resistant bacterial infections in humans and animals. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the bioactive extract with other additives for inhibiting the growth of drug resistant bacterial infections in humans and animals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Antibiotics have been used for long to cure bacterial, fungal and other infectious diseases of humans. Penicillin was the first antibiotic used against infections during the Second World War. Since then a number of antibiotics and their derivatives have been identified and used by man almost all of which were isolated from microbial sources. All the antibiotics in clinical use today can be grouped or classified according to their structure or functional groups. Streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline some of the well-known examples are aminoglycosides whereas penicillin and its derivatives are beta-lactam antibiotics. One of the commonly used antibacterials are quinolones or fluoroquinolones such as nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin etc. Fluoroquinolones are now widely used to treat urinary tract infections, upper respiratory tract infections, and tuberculosis, which are resistant to first-line drugs. However, many of the pathogenic bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria Sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli are developing resistance to fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics limiting their clinical usefulness. Since, the mechanism of action of all the quinolones against bacteria is similar, development of resistance to one of the quinolone antibiotic would confer simultaneous cross-resistance to almost all the other quinolones also. Fluoroquinolones act by inhibiting the function of a bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase essential for the maintenance of supercoil nature of the bacterial chromosome. Resistance development is observed when a mutation in the DNA gyrase enzyme A subunit (GyrA+) specifically in the region called "Quinolone Determining Region (QDR)" occurs. The modified mutant form of A subunit (GyrA-) is incapable of binding to quinolone antibiotics and therefore is resistant. Such quinolone resistant infections are particularly difficult to cure. Kumar et al (Phytotherapy Research 14: 14-15, 2000; US Patent No.6, 127,405)<br><br>
have identified a semi-synthetic plant compound α -arteether which is capable of specifically killing quinolone drug resistant bacterial infections. The α-arteether was obtained by etherification of artemissinin a sesquiterpene lactone compound from a Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua. In our effort to isolate and identify more potent plant compounds which are active against quinolone resistant bacteria we carried out a systematic bioactivity guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract prepared from the roots of Indian medicinal plant Vetiveria zizanioides. The subject mentioned below specifically describes the manner in which the compound inhibiting quinolone resistant bacteria was isolated and identified.<br>

In our study specifically directed at finding an antibiotic or plant compound, which<br>
can specifically kill quinolone drug resistant bacterial infections, we found that the<br>
ethanolic extract of roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was able to kill GyrA- mutant E.coli<br>
bacteria but not the wild type strains (GyrA+). The ethanolic extract was then<br>
fractionated by liquid-liquid chromatography and the hexane fraction was to found to<br>
possess the growth inhibitory activity. The hexane fraction was then fractionated<br><br>
using silica gel column chromatography wherein the fraction eluted using 10% Chloroform in hexane indicated the desired bioactivity of eliminating Mycobacterium smegmatis (GyrA-) growth. Further to isolate and purify the active principle the eluted 10% chloroform in hexane fraction was separated by column chromatography. The Chl:Hex (50:50) fraction obtained from this column was able kill the GyrA-strains of E.coli and M.smegmatis bacteria. The Chl:Hex (50:50) fraction was then purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain a pure fraction called CIM 109 which has shown the desired bioactivty. Thus CIM 109 isolated from the roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was able to inhibit the growth of fluoro-quinolone resistant (GyrA-) bacteria. Hence, CIM 109 can be used for treating quinolone resistant bacterial infections of human and animals.<br>
The detailed description of the invention is explained in the form of examples and should not construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Exam ple-1 The roots of Vetiveria zizanioides genotype KS-1 grown in CIMAP farm harvested during the month of April was dried in shade and ground to fine powder and then extracted by dipping the plant material overnight in different solvents. The solvent was then evaporated in vacuo and the residue termed as root extracts was redissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at the required concentration and analysed for bioactivity.<br>
ExampIe-2<br>
The ethanolic extracted prepared as above was tested for their growth inhibitory property against a number of bacterial strains by disc diffusion assay a procedure commonly followed and can be performed by persons skilled in the art. The results indicated that the ethanolic extracted residue showed a surprisingly interesting inhibitory activity against many bacterial strains. Hence, to explore the potential<br><br>
of  using   the   extracts    as anti-microbial agents the ethanolic extracted was then fractionated using different solvents as follows:<br>
 ROOTS OF VETIVERIA<br>
(Diagram Removed)<br>
Example-3<br>
The ethanolic extract of the roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was further fractionated by liquid - liquid chromatography using different solvents. The extracts were initially dissolved in citric acid containing water and the solvent extraction was performed with increasing degree of polarity. The solvent extracts obtained were then evaporated in vacuo and the residues were analysed for their anti-microbial activity by disc diffusion assays. The results as   in   table-1   indicate   that the methanolic fraction<br>
exhibited maximum bioactivity against bacterial pathogens. We observed an interesting feature that the methanolic fraction does not inhibit the growth of wild type E.coli starin CA8000 but was inhibitory to the nalidixic acid resistant strains of E.coli DH5a, NK5819 and ET8000. These strains were resistant to nalidixic acid by virtue of carrying mutations in the gyrA gene, which also confers resistance to other flouroquinolones (FQ) such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin etc. Hence we hypothesised that the methanolic extract might contain some active principle, which is able to specifically kill the FQ resistant bacteria but not the normal sensitive bacteria such as CA8000. Therefore to isolate the biologically active principle fraction, the applicants resorted to column chromatography of the methanolic fraction of the ethanolic root extract of Vetiveria zizanioides KS-1.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Example-4<br>
Further to test whether the active principle present in the methanolic can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium sp. we fractionated the methanolic extract using three different solvents by liquid - liquid chromatography a commonly used technique which a person skilled in the art can perform. The bioactivity testing against Mycobacterium smegmatis strain Mc2l55 results showed that the hexane, chloroform<br>
and methanol fractions were inhibitory to the nalidixic acid resistant strains (NalR)<br>
(6b and 13a) of Mycobacterium smegmatis strain Mc2l55 but not the wild type.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Hence, it is clear from the above observation that the active principle not only inhibits the growth of FQ resistant E.coli strains as in example-3 but also inhibits the growth of the FQ resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis strain 6b and 13a specifically.<br>
Example-5 Further to purify the active principle silica gel column chromatography was performed. Any person who is skilled in the art of related subjects can perform the technique. About 20g of hexane fraction was packed onto a silica gel column and the fractions were eluted in hexane - chloroform solvent system. The table-3 below gives the number of column fractions collected using each solvent system. The column fractions were subsequently analysed for their inhibitory activity against M.smegmatis wild type and the mutants resistant to nalidixic acid. The results indicate that the column fractions eluted using 10% Hexane in chloroform was able to inhibit only the nalidixic acid resistant strains of M.smegmatis and not the wild type bacteria whereas the 15% and 25% Hexane in chloroform was able to inhibit both the wild type and Nal R mutant indicating that it is non specific. Moreover the 60% Hexane: Chloroform fraction was able to inhibit the NalR strains of E.coli but not the wild type. Therefore the 10-60% hexane in chloroform fraction can inhibit the fluoroquinolone resistant strains of both E.coli and M.smegmatis and therefore possess the ability to cure such drug resistant infections in humans and animals.<br><br>
