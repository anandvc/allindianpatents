COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"ANTENNA DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND TRANSMITTING RF SIGNALS"<br>
AMC CENTURION AB, a Swedish company of Box 500, SE-184 25, Akersberga, Sweden,<br><br><br><br>
IN/PCT/2000/585/MUM<br>
             03/11/2000<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antenna device for receiving and transmitting RF signals and more particularly to an antenna device comprising communication device comprising such an antenna in general, and more specifically to an antenna device and a hand-held mobile communication device comprising such an antenna for receiving and transmitting circularly polarized RF signals for communication with satellites.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
One of the driving forces of the mobile communication industry today is availability and another is size. A user of a hand¬held mobile communication device requires to be reached wherever his location may be. This puts requirements on the operator to have good coverage of their mobile network, but for large unpopulated areas this is not possible with any reasonable economy. One solution for a user who frequently travels to unpopulated locations is to instead use a satellite telephone.<br>
Such a user will still have requirements on the size of his satellite communication device as he undoubtedly will compare his ordinary cellular communication device with his satellite communication device. Since the distance to orbiting satellites is so great the antennas used will be larger compared to antennas for cellular communication devices, and will consequently take a considerable amount of the space of a satellite communication device. The need for reducing the size of the antennas for satellite communication devices is thus<br><br>
large and anyone being able to reduce the size for such an antenna will have a considerable competitive advantage.<br>
In US-5,191,352 is a quadrifilar radio frequency antenna disclosed for receiving signals from an earth orbiting 5   satellite. The antenna has four helical wire elements shaped and arranged so as   to define a  cylindrical   envelope.   The elements are co-extensive in the axial direction of the envelope.<br>
WO 96/06468 discloses an antenna device with a ceramic core 10   with a relative dielectric constant of at least 5 where every second helical element is longer so that a self-phased antenna is achieved. Every second element is made longer through a meandering shape.<br>
In the journal Microwave Engineering Europe June/July 1995 an 15   antenna for personal hand-held terminals is disclosed. The antenna is of quadrifilar helix type.<br>

10   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 shows a prior art antenna. With 101 is a support denoted and with 102 is a feeding means denoted. The feeding means 102 comprises a first, second, third and fourth feeding points 102a, 102b&gt; 102C/ and 102d. Said feeding points are<br>
15   connected to a first, second, third and fourth radiating<br>
elements denoted 103a, 103b, 103c and 103d, commonly denoted 103. The,radiating elements are coaxially wounded around a common axis defining a helical structure. RF signals are fed to the radiating elements 103 from a circuitry 104 through a<br>
20   phasing network 105. The phasing network 105 converts the RF signal to four signals, each fed to one  feed point respectively, with a phase difference of 360°/4 = 90° enabling the antenna to produce circularly polarized RF signals. The signals may be right-hand or left-hand polarized. The<br>
25   different polarization is achieved by winding the radiating elements in a right-hand or a left-hand direction and by feeding the RF signals accordingly.<br><br>
Even though, throughout this description, mostly transmission of RF signals is described, the antenna device is of course also capable of receiving signals.<br>
Figure 2 shows an antenna according to a first preferred 5   embodiment of the invention. With 201 is a support denoted and a first, second and third feeding points is denoted 202a, 202b and 202c respectively. Said feeding points are coupled to a first, second and third radiating elements 203a, 203b and 203c respectively commonly denoted 203. Said radiating elements 203<br>
10   are in this preferred embodiments molded directly onto said support using MID (Molded Intrusion Design) technology. Said radiating elements 203 are arranged so as to form a cylindrical envelope on said support. That is, each radiating element is wounded round a common axis, defined by said<br>
15   support, coextending in a cylindrical manner so as to define an helical form with a common radius and pitch. A meandering pattern is superimposed on said helical form construing a common helical form with meandering pattern. In other words, each of said radiating elements 203a, 203b, 203c comprises a<br>
20   number of small bends or turns without complete turns so as to define a stair-like pattern on said support. The meandering pattern increases the electrical length of the radiating element for the same physical length and capacitively couples each radiating element to its neighbours, thereby enabling the<br>
25   design of a shorter antenna with a given electrical length for a specific application such as for instance Iridium, Globalstar etc. A circuitry 204 feeds RF signals to said feeding points 202 through a phasing network 205. Said phasing network 205 converts the RF signal to three different signals<br>
30  with a phase difference of 360°/3  = 120° and  feeds said signals to each of said feeding points 202 respectively enabling the production of circularly polarized RF signals. The signals may<br><br>
be right-hand or left-hand polarized. The different polarization is achieved by winding the radiating elements in a right-hand or a left-hand direction and by feeding the RF signals accordingly. The meandering shape of the radiating 5   elements may be arranged so that capacitive coupling occur between the different radiating elements.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second preferred embodiment according to the invention. A support is denoted 301 and a first and second feeding points, in a first end 305 of said support 301, are<br>
10   denoted 302a and 302b respectively. A first and second radiating element is denoted 303a and 303b respectively commonly denoted 303. Said radiating patterns 303 are arranged so as to form a helical cylindrical envelope on said support with an overlaid meandering pattern. That is each radiating<br>
15   element is wounded around a common axis, defined by said<br>
support, in a cylindrical manner so as to define a helical pattern. In other words, each of said radiating elements 303 comprises a number of small bends or turns back-and-forth without complete turns so as to define a stair-like pattern on<br>
20   said support. The radiating patterns are printed, etched or<br>
similar on a thin dielectric carrier. Said carrier is fixedly mounted on said support, for instance with an adhesive agent. Each radiating element 303 further comprises a coupling portion 304 for capacitivly couple said first radiating<br>
25   element 303a to said second radiating element 303b in a second end 306 distal to said first end 305. Said coupling portion 304 comprises a receiving member 307 and a extending member 308 where said extending member 308 fits into said receiving member 307 so as to construe a capacitance. The top<br>
30   capacitance enables the design of even shorter antennas for a given electrical length, it also improves the overall efficiency of the antenna.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a third preferred embodiment according to the invention. With 401 is a support denoted, first, second, third and fourth feeding points are denoted 402a, 402b, 402c and 402d respectively and first, second, third and fourth 5   radiating elements are denoted 403a, 403b, 403c and 403d<br>
respectively. A first end comprising the feeding points 402 is denoted 404 and a second end distal to said first end is denoted 405. A first coupling portion is denoted 406 and a second coupling portion is denoted 407 said coupling portions<br>
10   406 and 407 comprise receiving members and extending members similar to the receiving and extending members described in accordance with the second preferred embodiment and figure 3. The antenna in figure 4 is arranged for receiving and/or transmitting RF signals in two different separate bands. The<br>
15   first coupling portion 4 06 construing a capacitive coupling between a first radiating 4 03a element and its neighbours, that is the first radiating elements neighbours is the second and fourth elements 403b and 403d, is effectively lengthening the electrical length of said antenna, adjusted to a first<br>
20  band for receiving and/or transmitting RF signals, compared to  the physical length. The second coupling portion 407 is  arranged at a distance from said first or second end 404 or 405 so as to adjust said antenna to transmit and/or receive RF signals in a second band with increased efficiency. Said two<br>
25   bands may one be for receiving RF signals and the other for receiving RF signals or both may be for both receiving and transmitting signals. The invention thus make it possible to design a hand-held radio communication device with one single antenna for receiving and/or transmitting RF signals in two<br>
30   separate bands.<br>
In figure 5 is a fourth preferred embodiment according to the invention disclosed. With 501 is a support denoted and with<br><br>
502a and 502b is a first and second feeding means denoted. With 503a is a first radiating element denoted and with 503b is a second radiating element denoted. Said first and second radiating elements are coaxially arranged and shaped so as to 5   form a cylindrical helical envelope, further more each<br>
radiating elements comprises small bends or turns back-and-forth without any complete turns so as to define a meandering pattern superimposed on the helical structure. A first disc is arranged in a first end and fixedly mounted to said support<br>
10   501, said feeding means 502 and said radiating elements 503 enabling coupling between the feeding means 502.and the radiating elements 503. A second disc 505 is arranged on a second end distal to said first end and fixedly mounted to said support 501 and to said first and second radiating<br>
15   elements 503a and 503b. Said second disc 505 may or may not<br>
comprise a capacitive coupling between said radiating elements 503a and 503b.<br>
In figure 6 is a fifth preferred embodiment according to the invention shown. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment<br>
20   just described with the difference of a third disc 601 enabling capacitive coupling between a first and second radiating element 602a and 602b at a distance L from a first end 604. The distance L is chosen to improve the characteristics of the antenna for a second band for receiving<br>
25   and transmitting RF signals if the total length of the antenna is chosen for optimal performance for a first band for receiving and transmitting RF signals. Of course it might be beneficial to do some trade off in the performance for the first band to improve the characteristics for the second band.<br>
30   In figure 7a and 7b is discs 701 disclosed with capacitive coupling 702 between the radiating elements 703. Figure 7b<br><br>
also discloses a disc for an antenna with four wires. Figure 7c shows a disc where the capacitors are coupled to a common connection point 704 and also where the antenna elements are not symmetrically arranged but rather with 90° phase difference 5   between a first radiator 703 and a second and third radiator 705 and 706, the second radiator 705 having 90° phase difference to the first radiator 703 and 180° to the third radiator 706 and the third radiator 706 having 90° phase difference to the first radiator 703 and 180° to the second 10   radiator 705.<br>
Figure 8 shows a sixth preferred embodiment according to the invention. Five radiating elements 801 is arranged in a helical form construing an cylindrical envelope on a support 802. In this embodiment a different radiating pattern is used<br>
15   with meandering edges. The pattern comprises alternating<br>
broader and narrower passages so that the edges of the pattern form a meandering shape. Thus, this type of pattern is also included in term meandering pattern or meander radiating element. Coupling portions 803 at a first end capacitively<br>
20   couples' each radiating element to its neighbour, that is the first element is capacitively coupled to the second and fifth element, the second element is capacitively coupled to the third and first element and so on to the fifth element which is capacitively coupled to the fourth and first element.<br>
25   Figure 9 discloses a hand-held radio communication device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 10a and 10b shows different radiating patterns to be applied to a thin flexible carrier and fixedly secured onto a support using for instance a adhesive agent<br><br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. For instance is it obvious that the radiating elements may be wounded in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction even though only one 5   direction is disclosed in the appended drawings. Such<br>
variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
