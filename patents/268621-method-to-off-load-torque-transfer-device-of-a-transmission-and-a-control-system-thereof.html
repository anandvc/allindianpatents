CLUTCH CONTROL FOR HYBRID TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to hybrid powertrain control<br>
systems, and more specifically to clutch control related to executing<br>
transmission shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Various hybrid powertrain architectures are known for managing the<br>
input and output torques of various prime-movers in hybrid vehicles, most<br>
commonly internal combustion engines and electric machines. One such<br>
hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from a prime mover power source, typically an internal<br>
combustion engine, and an output member for delivering motive torque from<br>
the transmission to a driveline of the vehicle. First and second electrical<br>
machines are operatively connected to an electrical energy storage device for<br>
interchanging electrical power therebetween. The first and second electrical<br>
machines comprise motor/generators operable to transform the electrical<br>
power to motive torque for input to the transmission, independent of torque<br>
input from the internal combustion engine. The first and second electrical<br>
machines are operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through<br>
the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy potential that is storable in the<br>
electrical energy storage device. A control unit is provided for regulating the<br>
electrical power interchange between the electrical energy storage device and<br>
the first and second motor/generators.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
2<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems including transmissions<br>
are tasked with developing gear shifting schemes. Such transmission systems<br>
typically include devices able to operate in one of a plurality of fixed-gear<br>
modes, wherein shifting between gears occurs in response to predetermined<br>
operating conditions, and often not involving an overt request for shift from a<br>
vehicle operator.<br>
[0004] An exemplary transmission includes a plurality of torque-transmitting<br>
clutches. When a shift change is commanded, torque must be off-loaded from<br>
a currently operating clutch associated with operation in a current gear and on-<br>
loaded to another clutch associated with operation in another gear.<br>
[0005] An ongoing concern for designers of transmission devices is to<br>
develop torque-transmitting clutches that are sufficiently large enough to<br>
transmit required torque, able to manage temperatures, and meet durability<br>
targets, but meet constraints related to packaging envelope, size, and cost.<br>
Furthermore, engineers must be cognizant of thermal energy generated during<br>
clutch slippage, and effect of such thermal energy on transmission<br>
performance and durability.<br>
[0006] Therefore, there is a need to for a method and apparatus to offload<br>
torque from a currently operating clutch associated with operation in a current<br>
gear to address concerns mentioned hereinabove.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove, a method and an<br>
article of manufacture are provided to off-load torque from a currently<br>
operating clutch, in preparation for executing a transmission shift from an<br>
initial gear to a final gear in a transmission of a powertrain system.<br>
[0008] To effect a gear change from a first fixed gear to a second fixed gear,<br>
it is often necessary to disengage a first clutch that is currently transmitting<br>
torque, and engage a second clutch. Disengaging the first clutch is preferably<br>
accomplished by first off-load torque. In overall operation, to off-load torque<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
3<br>
from the currently engaged clutch to effect a shift change, the control system<br>
acts to determine a commanded output torque based at least in part upon<br>
operator input. A subset of the torque-generative devices, preferably<br>
comprising electrical motors, are preferentially controlled to transmit a first<br>
motive torque to the transmission substantially equal to the commanded output<br>
torque, limited by a torque capacity of the electrical motors. When the torque<br>
capacity supplied from the motors is insufficient to meet the commanded<br>
output torque, a supplemental motive torque is generated. The supplemental<br>
torque, generated using the second, oncoming clutch, is preferably equal to a<br>
difference between the commanded output torque and the first motive torque.<br>
The supplemental motive torque limited by torque capacity of the oncoming<br>
clutch. When the torque capacity supplied from the motors and the oncoming<br>
clutch is insufficient to meet the commanded output torque, torque transmitted<br>
from a second subset of the torque-generative devices, preferably an engine is<br>
reduced by an amount substantially equal to a difference between the<br>
commanded output torque and the first and the supplemental motive torques.<br>
[0009] The exemplary powertrain system comprises a plurality of torque-<br>
generative devices each operable to supply motive torque to the transmission<br>
device and vehicle driveline, and the exemplary transmission device comprises<br>
a two-mode, compound-split, hybrid electro-mechanical transmission having<br>
four fixed gear ratios. There is a plurality of gears operable to transmit torque<br>
between the transmission device and an output shaft using a plurality of<br>
torque-transfer devices. The torque-generative devices preferably comprise a<br>
pair of electrical machines and an internal combustion engine. Torque<br>
transmission can be in the form of transmitting motive torque from one of the<br>
torque-generative devices through the transmission to the vehicle driveline.<br>
Torque transmission can be in the form of transmitting wheel torque resulting<br>
from vehicle momentum, through the transmission to one of the torque<br>
generative devices, in order to transmit torque to effect electrical generation<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
4<br>
using one of the electrical machines, or to transmit torque to the internal<br>
combustion engine to effect engine braking.<br>
[0010] Therefore, in accordance with the present invention there is provided<br>
an article of manufacture, comprising a storage medium having a computer<br>
program encoded therein for effecting a method to off-load torque from one of<br>
a plurality of torque transfer devices of a transmission of a powertrain system,<br>
wherein torque is transmitted from at least one of a plurality of torque-<br>
generative devices to the transmission through actuation of at least one of the<br>
plurality of torque-transfer devices. The computer program comprises a<br>
method, including determining a commanded output torque of the powertrain.<br>
A first motive torque is preferentially transmitted to the transmission of a<br>
magnitude substantially equal to the commanded output torque to the<br>
transmission device. The first motive torque is transmitted from torque-<br>
generative devices comprising first and second electrical motors, and is<br>
limited by torque capacities of the first and second electrical motors. A<br>
supplemental motive torque is preferentially supplied to the transmission of a<br>
magnitude substantially equal to a difference between the commanded output<br>
torque and the first motive torque. The supplemental motive torque is<br>
preferably transmitted from an oncoming torque-transfer device. The<br>
supplemental motive torque is limited by a torque capacity of the oncoming<br>
torque-transfer device. Output torque of the powertrain is adjusted by an<br>
amount substantially equal to a difference between the commanded output<br>
torque and the first and the supplemental motive torques.<br>
[0011] An aspect of the invention includes adjusting the output torque of the<br>
powertrain by an amount substantially equal to a difference between the<br>
commanded output torque and the first and the supplemental motive torques,<br>
which comprises reducing torque transmitted by an internal combustion<br>
engine operably connected to the transmission. This includes engine control<br>
schemes of reducing fuel delivery, or retarding timing of spark ignition to the<br>
internal combustion engine. Alternatively, adjusting output torque of the<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
5<br>
powertrain can comprise increasing torque transmitted from the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
[0012] Another aspect of the invention comprises preferentially supplying a<br>
supplemental motive torque to the transmission by increasing torque capacity<br>
of the second torque-transfer device, and increasing a reactive torque of the<br>
second torque-transfer device. This includes actuating a clutch control<br>
solenoid operable to actuate the second torque transfer device.<br>
[0013] Another aspect of the invention comprises determining a commanded<br>
output torque of the powertrain by monitoring an operator demand for power.<br>
Determining a commanded output torque of the powertrain also comprises<br>
determining a torque demand resulting from a controller command to change<br>
an operating mode of one of the first and second electrical motors between an<br>
electrical energy generating mode and a torque generating mode.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises each of the torque-generative<br>
devices operable to independently supply motive torque to the transmission<br>
device. The transmission is preferably a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission, and the powertrain system is operable to provide<br>
motive torque to a driveline of a vehicle.<br>
[0014] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 show a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0020] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S.<br>
2005/0137042 Al, published June 23, 2005, entitled Two-Mode, Compound-<br>
Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The hybrid transmission 10 has an input member<br>
12 that may be in the nature of a shaft which may be directly driven by an<br>
engine 14. A transient torque damper 20 is incorporated between the output<br>
shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input member 12 of the hybrid transmission<br>
10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably comprises a torque transfer<br>
device 77 having characteristics of a damping mechanism and a spring, shown<br>
respectively as 78 and 79. The transient torque damper 20 permits selective<br>
engagement of the engine 14 with the hybrid transmission 10, but it must be<br>
understood that the torque transfer device 77 is not utilized to change, or<br>
control, the mode in which the hybrid transmission 10 operates. The torque<br>
transfer device 77 preferably comprises a hydraulically operated friction<br>
clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
7<br>
[0021] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a power output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
[0022] Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the hybrid transmission 10<br>
utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24<br>
has an outer gear member 30 that may generally be designated as a ring gear,<br>
which circumscribes an inner gear member 32, generally designated as a sun<br>
gear. A plurality of planetary gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a<br>
carrier 36 such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both<br>
the outer gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
[0023] The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer gear member 38,<br>
generally designated as a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member<br>
40, generally designated as a sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members<br>
42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each planetary gear 42<br>
meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the inner gear member<br>
40.<br>
[0024] The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer gear member 46,<br>
generally designated as a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member<br>
48, generally designated as a sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members<br>
50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each planetary gear 50<br>
meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the inner gear member<br>
48.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
8<br>
[0025] Ratios of teeth on ring gears/sun gears are typically based upon<br>
design considerations known to skilled practitioners and outside the scope of<br>
the present invention. By way of example, in one embodiment, the ring<br>
gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 24 is 65/33; the ring gear/sun<br>
gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 26 is 65/33; and the ring gear/sun gear<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 28 is 94/34.<br>
[0026] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a hub plate gear 54, to the outer gear<br>
member 38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear<br>
member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of<br>
the second planetary gear set 26 are continuously connected to a first electrical<br>
machine or motor/generator 56, also referred to as 'Motor A'.<br>
[0027] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a shaft 60,<br>
to the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and<br>
44 of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, as through a torque transfer device 62 which, as<br>
will be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the selection<br>
of the operational modes of the hybrid transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output<br>
member 64.<br>
[0028] In the embodiment described herein, wherein the hybrid transmission<br>
10 is used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline comprising a gear box 90 or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles 92 or half-shafts (not<br>
shown). The axles 92, in turn, terminate in drive members 96. The drive<br>
members 96 may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
9<br>
are employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track vehicle. The drive<br>
members 96 may have some form of wheel brake 94 associated therewith.<br>
The drive members each have a speed parameter, NWHL, comprising rotational<br>
speed of each wheel 96 which is typically measurable with a wheel speed<br>
sensor.<br>
[0029] The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28, as<br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously connected to a<br>
second electrical machine, or motor/generator 72, also referred to as 'Motor<br>
B'.<br>
[0030] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as the two electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft<br>
60. Electrical machines 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which<br>
permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such<br>
that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
electrical machines 56 and 72. This configuration assures that the overall<br>
envelope, i.e., the circumferential dimension, of the transmission 10 is<br>
minimized.<br>
[0031] A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with<br>
ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device 75 is<br>
operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting<br>
the sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62, 70, 73, 75<br>
are all friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch CI 70,<br>
clutch C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
10<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump<br>
when a corresponding clutch control solenoid is actuated. Hydraulic actuation<br>
of each of the clutches is accomplished using a known hydraulic fluid circuit<br>
having a plurality of clutch-control solenoids, which is not described in detail<br>
herein.<br>
[0032] The hybrid transmission 10 receives input motive torque from a<br>
plurality of torque-generative devices, including the engine 14 and the<br>
electrical machines 56 and 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or<br>
electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and<br>
electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store electric<br>
power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries<br>
without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is<br>
preferably sized based upon factors including regenerative requirements,<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range.<br>
The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br>
module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines or transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an<br>
element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The<br>
TPIM 19 communicates with the first electrical machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly communicates with the second<br>
electrical machine 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor controllers configured to receive motor control commands<br>
and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality.<br>
[0033] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from the<br>
DC lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical machine over<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
11<br>
receives AC current from the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29<br>
and 31 and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided<br>
to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of<br>
the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably, Motor A 56 and Motor B<br>
72 are three-phase AC machines and the inverters comprise complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics.<br>
[0034] Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear 80 may be presented from the<br>
input member 12. As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
electrical machines 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshingly<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The other<br>
end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a hydraulic/transmission fluid pump<br>
and/or power take-off ('PTO') unit, designated either individually or<br>
collectively at 88, and comprise an accessory load.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed controller architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and motors 56, 72. The distributed controller<br>
architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control<br>
module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and<br>
Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A hybrid control module<br>
('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned controllers. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
12<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Each of the aforementioned controllers communicates with other controllers,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various controllers. The specific communication protocol utilized<br>
is application-specific. By way of example, one communications protocol is<br>
the Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-controller<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned controllers, and other controllers<br>
providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle<br>
stability.<br>
[0036] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an engine torque command, TE_CMD; clutch torque<br>
commands, TCL_N_CMD for the various clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands, TA_CMD and TB_CMD, for the<br>
electrical motors A and B, respectively.<br>
[0037] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command, TE_CMD, from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque,<br>
TAXLE_DES, and an indication of actual engine torque, TE_ACT, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
13<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (NE) to a shaft leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0038] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques, TCL_N_EST, for each of the clutches CI, C2, C3, and,<br>
C4 and rotational speed, N0, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the<br>
HCP for control purposes.<br>
[0039] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, BatSOC, and other states of the batteries,<br>
including voltage, VBAT, and available power, PBAT_MiNand PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0040] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes a pair<br>
of power inverters and motor controllers configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque<br>
commands for Motors A and B, TA_CMD and TB_CMD, based upon input from the<br>
HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system operating<br>
parameters. The predetermined torque commands for Motors A and B, TACMD<br>
and TB_CMD, are adjusted with motor damping torques, TA_DAMP and TB_DAMP, to<br>
determine motor torques, TA and TB, which are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control the motors A and B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals, NA and NB for Motor A and Motor B respectively, are<br>
derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or conventional<br>
rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and communicates motor speeds,<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
14<br>
NA and NB, to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged.<br>
[0041] Each of the aforementioned controllers is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each controller has a set of control<br>
algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in<br>
ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer.<br>
Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0042] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the controllers<br>
are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0043] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP controller 5 and one or more of the other controllers<br>
determine required transmission output torque, T0. Selectively operated<br>
components of the hybrid transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and<br>
manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For example, in the<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
15<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected<br>
a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque for the transmission, which<br>
affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission required to<br>
arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the<br>
transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in<br>
order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0044] The two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, includes output member 64 which receives output power through<br>
two distinct gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several<br>
transmission operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and<br>
Table 1, below.<br><br>
Table 1			<br>
Transmission Operating	Mode	Actuated Clutches<br>
Mode I		CI 70	<br>
Fixed Ratio 1		CI 70	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 2		CI 70	C2 62<br>
Mode II		C2 62	<br>
Fixed Ratio 3		C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 4		C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0045] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated<br>
for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, Motor A 56 or Motor B 72 may each operate as electrical<br>
motors, designated as MA, MB respectively, and whether motor A 56 is<br>
operating as a generator, designated as GA. A first mode, or gear train, is<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
16<br>
selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated in order to "ground" the<br>
outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set 28. A second mode, or<br>
gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is released and the<br>
torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to<br>
the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other factors outside the<br>
scope of the invention affect when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as<br>
motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0046] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds, N0, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0047] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
CI 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0048] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. N,/N0, is achieved. The rotations of the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism<br>
as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, N,, determined<br>
or measured at shaft 12. The motor/generators function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
17<br>
power from the engine and power from Motors A and B, through planetary<br>
gear set 28 by accepting power from the energy storage device 74.<br>
[0049] The transmission operating mode can be switched between Fixed<br>
Ratio operation and Mode operation by activating or deactivating one the<br>
additional clutches during Mode I or Mode II operation. Determination of<br>
operation in fixed ratio or mode control is by algorithms executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention.<br>
[0050] The modes of operation may overlap the ratio of operation, and<br>
selection depends again on the driver's input and response of the vehicle to<br>
that input. RANGE 1 falls primarily within mode I operation when clutches<br>
CI 70 and C4 75 are engaged. RANGE 2 falls within mode I and mode II<br>
when clutches C2 62 and CI 70 are engaged. A third fixed ratio range is<br>
available primarily during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio range is available during mode II when<br>
clutches C2 62 and C3 73 are engaged. It is notable that ranges of operation<br>
for Mode I and Mode II typically overlap significantly.<br>
[0051] Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations. The output speed, N0,<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed, NE, measured at shaft 18, and transmission input speed, N,,<br>
measured at shaft 12, and speed limitations of the electric motors A and B,<br>
designated as +/- NA, +/- NB. Output torque, T0, of the transmission 64 is<br>
similarly limited due to limitations of the engine input torque, TE, and input<br>
torque, T,, measured at shaft 12 after the transient torque damper 20, and<br>
torque limitations (TA__MAX, TA_MIN, TB_MAX, TB_MIN) of the motors A and B 56,<br>
72.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
18<br>
[0052] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
change in operator demand for output torque, typically communicated through<br>
inputs to the UI 13, including the accelerator pedal, the brake pedal, the<br>
transmission gear selector, and, the vehicle speed cruise control system.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g. changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. Furthermore, a change in demand for output<br>
torque may be predicated on a change in powertrain torque demand caused by<br>
a controller command to change one of the electrical machines between<br>
electrical energy generating mode and torque generating mode. The<br>
distributed control architecture acts in concert to determine a need for a<br>
change in transmission operating gear, and executes the forgoing to effect the<br>
change in gear.<br>
[0053] Referring now to Figs. 3-6, a graphical depiction of an element of a<br>
fixed gear-to-fixed gear shifting event is now described, comprising off-<br>
loading transmitted torque from one of the torque-transfer devices comprising<br>
friction clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. This action is preferably<br>
executed as one or more coded algorithms in the distributed control<br>
architecture to control and manage operation of the aforementioned powertrain<br>
and driveline system.<br>
[0054] To effect a gear change from a first fixed gear to a second fixed gear,<br>
it is often necessary to disengage a first clutch that is currently transmitting<br>
torque, and engage a second clutch, as shown in Table 1. Disengaging the<br>
first clutch is preferably accomplished by first off-load torque. In overall<br>
operation, to off-load torque from the currently engaged clutch (i.e., CI, C2,<br>
C3, C4) to effect a shift change, the control system described hereinabove acts<br>
to determine a commanded output torque based at least in part upon operator<br>
input. A subset of the torque-generative devices, preferably the electrical<br>
motors 56, 72, are preferentially controlled to transmit a first motive torque to<br>
the transmission substantially equal to the commanded output torque, limited<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
19<br>
by a torque capacity of the electrical motors. When the torque capacity<br>
supplied from the motors 56, 72 is insufficient to meet the commanded output<br>
torque, a supplemental motive torque is generated. The supplemental torque,<br>
generated using the second, oncoming clutch, is preferably equal to a<br>
difference between the commanded output torque and the first motive torque.<br>
The supplemental motive torque limited by torque capacity of the oncoming<br>
clutch. When the torque capacity supplied from the motors 56, 72 and the<br>
oncoming clutch is insufficient to meet the commanded output torque, torque<br>
transmitted from a second subset of the torque-generative devices, preferably<br>
the engine 14, is reduced by an amount substantially equal to a difference<br>
between the commanded output torque and the first and the supplemental<br>
motive torques. In operation, the control system is preferably operable to<br>
determine the first motive torque, the supplemental motive torque, and the<br>
torque reduction substantially simultaneously, in order to limit the amount of<br>
time the transmission requires for shifting. This is described in greater detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0055] In operation, a commanded output torque, T0CMD of the powertrain is<br>
determined. A first motive torque is preferentially supplied as input to the<br>
transmission 10 from the first and second electrical motors 56 and 72,<br>
substantially equal to the commanded output torque to the transmission<br>
device. The first motive torque is limited by torque-generative capacities of<br>
the first and second electrical motors, TA, TB. A supplemental motive torque,<br>
referred to as TCON, is transmitted to the transmission from an oncoming<br>
torque-transfer device. The supplemental motive torque Tc 0N is substantially<br>
equal to a difference between the commanded output torque, T0 CMD, and the<br>
first motive torque, comprising TA, TB. The supplemental motive torque TC_0N<br>
is limited by torque capacity of the oncoming torque-transfer device, i.e.<br>
maximum TC_0N- When the first motive torque, comprising TA, TB and the<br>
supplemental motive torque Tc 0N are insufficient to meet the commanded<br>
motive torque, T0CMD, the control system acts to reduce the output torque, T0,<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
20<br>
of the transmission by an amount equal to the difference. This is now<br>
described in detail.<br>
[0056] The commanded output torque, T0 CMD of the powertrain is<br>
determined based upon operator input through the UI 13 and other powertrain<br>
and system commands related to demands for power arising from charging<br>
and discharging the electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74.<br>
[0057] Referring now to Fig. 3, a data-graph of operating ranges of the<br>
electrical motors A, B is shown, wherein the x-axis comprises a range of<br>
output torque parameters for Motor A 56, and the y-axis comprises a range of<br>
torque values for Motor B 72. The range of available operating torque<br>
parameters for Motors A and B are limited by available power based upon<br>
minimum and maximum battery power, referred to as PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX-<br>
These limits are shown as lines on the graphs. For operation in a fixed<br>
transmission gear, maximum and minimum clutch reactive torque values,<br>
TcR_MAX, TcR_M1N, are determined for predetermined input and output torque<br>
parameters, T,, T0.<br>
[0058] Reactive torque is defined as a magnitude of torque transmitted<br>
through a torque-transfer device, i.e. a clutch. Torque capacity is defined as a<br>
maximum amount of torque transmissible across a clutch, and is generally<br>
based upon magnitude of clutch pressure and clutch friction. When the<br>
magnitude of clutch torque exceeds the torque capacity, clutch slip occurs.<br>
The reactive torque is always less than or equal to the torque capacity. Clutch<br>
pressure is created by controlling magnitude of hydraulic pressure applied to<br>
the clutch by the hydraulic circuit of the transmission.<br>
[0059] To off-load a specific torque-transmitting clutch, the clutch reactive<br>
torque has preferably reached a value substantially equal to zero, i.e. no torque<br>
is being transmitted between the torque-generating devices and-the vehicle<br>
driveline across the specific clutch. When the TcR_MIN value is a negative<br>
torque, and the TcR_MAX value is a positive torque, then a net reactive torque<br>
of zero is achievable using only torque outputs from Motor A and Motor B.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
21<br>
This is shown as points along the constant Tb T0 line between TcR_MAX and<br>
TcR_MiN on Fig. 3. In this situation, the control system commands the TPIM<br>
controller 19 to transfer sufficient quantity of electrical energy to Motors A 56<br>
and B 72 such that their outputs comprise appropriate operating points to<br>
generate input torques TA, TB for input to the transmission device 10. When<br>
Motors A and B reach desired input torques TA, TB, the clutch reactive torque<br>
is at zero, and the off-going clutch can be deactivated without additional<br>
actions. Such action is shown graphically with reference now to Fig. 4.<br>
[0060] When the TcR_MAX, TcR_MiN values are both negative torques, or the<br>
TcR _MAX; TCR_MIN, values are both positive torques, then a net reactive torque<br>
of zero can not be achieved using only torque outputs from Motor A and<br>
Motor B. This is shown with reference now to Fig. 5. In this scenario, a<br>
supplemental motive torque is preferentially supplied, comprising torque<br>
transmitted from an oncoming torque-transfer device, i.e. one of friction<br>
clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. Magnitude of the supplemental<br>
motive torque is substantially equal to a difference between the commanded<br>
output torque and the first motive torque, and, limited by a torque capacity of<br>
the oncoming torque-transfer device.<br>
[0061] To generate the supplemental motive torque, Motors A and B are<br>
commanded to generate a minimum torque value TcR_M1N that is achievable at<br>
the current operating point, when both motor torque values, TA, TB, are<br>
positive torques, as determinable with reference again to results shown in the<br>
datagraph of Fig. 3. Alternatively, Motors A and B can be commanded to<br>
generate a maximum torque value TcR_MAX that is achievable at the current<br>
operating point, when both motor torque values, TA, TB, are negative torques.<br>
The intent is to control motor torques TA, TBto minimum absolute values.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
22<br>
[0062] When the motor torques TA, TB are controlled to, or are about to<br>
achieve the minimum absolute values, a clutch-fill command is executed for<br>
the oncoming clutch, and the oncoming clutch is commanded on. The<br>
oncoming clutch generates supplemental motive torque TCON which increases<br>
up to a value equal to the reactive torque of the off-going clutch, with an upper<br>
limit being a maximum value of the clutch torque capacity, referred to as<br>
1C_ON_MAX-<br>
[0063] When input torques TA, TB, from motors A and B, combined with the<br>
supplemental motive torque TC_0N are equal to the commanded output torque,<br>
then the reactive torque of the off-going clutch is at zero, and the off-going<br>
clutch can be deactivated without additional actions.<br>
[0064] When the reactive torque of the off-going clutch exceeds the input<br>
torques TA, TB, from motors A and B combined with the supplemental motive<br>
torque Tc 0N, then there is a need to reduce output torque of the powertrain, T0,<br>
in order to accomplish the off-loading of the clutch, in order to permit a shift<br>
to another gear. The reduction in output torque of the powertrain, T„,<br>
generally comprises reducing the input torque, T,, by an amount equal to<br>
remaining reactive torque determined after combination of input torques TA,<br>
TB, from motors A and B, and the supplemental motive torque TCJ3N, to<br>
achieve the desired output torque, T0. Reducing the input torque Ti generally<br>
comprises reducing engine torque, TE, by an amount equal to a calculated<br>
difference. Preferably the engine torque is reduced in a ramped manner to<br>
minimize effect upon operator perception, and to reduce risk that the operator<br>
takes corrective actions that interfere with the off-loading event. This is<br>
shown on the T0 line, between T5 and T6, and identified by letter "J" in Fig. 6.<br>
Reducing engine torque can be accomplished by the control system by<br>
implementing such known actions as reducing fueling to the engine, or<br>
retarding spark, or by adjusting fuel delivery times, on vehicle systems<br>
equipped with such capabilities.<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
23<br>
[0065] Referring again to Fig. 6, overall operation as a function of time is<br>
detailed. In response to a command to offload torque, there is a command to<br>
reduce clutch reactive torque by offloading the clutch reactive torque using<br>
Motors A and B. First motive torque is commanded to be output from Motors<br>
A and B, comprising output torques TA, TB, shown at time Tl. Torque<br>
capacities of Motors A and B are achieved at time T2, wherein it is shown that<br>
actual clutch torque is still greater than zero in this example. Therefore,<br>
supplemental motive torque is transmitted from the oncoming clutch, Tr_0N,<br>
starting at time T3. The oncoming clutch torque, TCON, is preferably ramped<br>
up to a maximum value, TC_ON_MAX, equal to the torque capacity of the<br>
oncoming clutch, at time T4. It is shown in this example that the actual clutch<br>
torque remains greater than zero in this example. Therefore, in this example<br>
the input torque, Ti, to the transmission is reduced in a ramped reduction,<br>
starting at time T5, until clutch torque is substantially equal to zero torque<br>
transmitted across the off-going clutch, shown at time T6. Typically, reducing<br>
input torque, Ti, is achieved by reducing the engine torque, TE, using known<br>
engine output torque management techniques including reducing fueling to the<br>
engine, or retarding spark.<br>
[0066] It is understood that application-specific masses, inertias, friction<br>
factors, and other characteristics and parameters of the driveline affect various<br>
powertrain and driveline operating states, and therefore the response times and<br>
magnitudes are intended to be exemplary, while still descriptive of the overall<br>
operation of the powertrain system.<br>
[0067] As previously described, the transmission device 10 comprises a<br>
plurality of gears and torque-transfer devices operable to transmit torque<br>
between the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72 and the output shaft 64 and<br>
drive wheels 96 of the driveline. Torque transmission may comprise transfer<br>
of motive torque from one or more of the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72<br>
to the driveline. Torque transmission may comprise transfer of torque from<br>
the drive wheels 96 via the driveline and transmission to one or more of the<br><br>
GP-307503-PTA-CD<br>
24<br>
torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72 as a result of a process commonly<br>
referred to as engine-braking. In this configuration, engine-braking comprises<br>
transmitting at least a portion of driveline torque resulting from vehicle<br>
momentum from the output shaft 64 through torque-transfer devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches CI, C2, C3, C4, to the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72. The<br>
transmitted torque is absorbed by the powertrain in the form of electrical<br>
energy generation through the motor/generators 56, 72, and, engine braking<br>
through the internal combustion engine 14.<br>
[0068] It is understood that modifications in the transmission hardware are<br>
allowable within the scope of the invention. The invention has been described<br>
with specific reference to the preferred embodiments and modifications<br>
thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
