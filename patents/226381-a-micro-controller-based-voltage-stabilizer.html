	Title of the Invention:	<br>
MICRO CONTROLLER BASED AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE STABILISER /<br>
	CORRECTOR.	<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to improvement / novel concept / design, which is uncharted till<br>
date in the manufacturing of Electronic Automatic Voltage Stabiliser.	<br>
This invention is for Making / manufacturing of Electronic Automatic Voltage stabilisers<br>
by incorporating a micro controller in the product which will replace the work done by<br>
discreet components to attain the desired goals / results as expected by the electronic<br>
automatic voltage stabiliser, by a source code / programme by way of embedded software<br>
on the micro controller.	<br>
The invention relates to the commonly used protection device for the electronic equipments, medical equipments, consumer durables /white goods like air conditioners, refrigerators, etc.<br>
The said device is generically known by the term Electronic Automatic Voltage Stabilser or Electronic Voltage Stabiliser.<br>
The invention conceives the use of the latest technology of electronics, which marries the hard ware (integrated circuits) to that of the software. These devices are known as Micro controllers. The micro controllers are basically small programmable devices, which do routine and periodical computation based on the inputs they receive. As programming is an integral part of use of micro controllers, coding of the soft ware also plays an important role.<br>
As on date all the electronic automatic voltage stablisers use only discrete components and ICs to achieve the desired results as required.<br>
Now it is conceptualised that by using a micro controller the product performance not only gets enhanced but also will be more accurate in getting the desired results / performance.<br>
The density of the components will also get substantially reduced due to the use of the micro controller. <br>

PRIOR ART / PROLOUGE:<br>
A voltage stabilizer is a devise which takes an input voltage, senses the same and applies correction and supply an output voltage which is quite near to the standard supply voltage or the appropriate working voltage of the electrical devise. In Indian conditions, the output voltage is generally between 200 Volts AC to 240 Volts AC.<br>
Stabilisers are of the following types:<br>
1	Having an electrical auto transformer with populated PCB to do the required<br>
corrections for the input voltage; driven by hardware logic<br>
2	Having a Servo motor based electrical transformer with populated PCB to do<br>
the required corrections for the input voltage - driven by hardware logic<br>
3	Having a constant voltage transformer with or without a populate PCB<br>
Among the above three, first type of stabilizer is most widely used in the market. Servo motor based units are mostly preferred for higher capacities.<br>
A stabiliser has got the following components / items:<br>
1	An autotransformer of the appropriate power rating (called as VA rating in<br>
electrical terminology) with required primary and secondary windings.<br>
2	A populated PCB with electronic components which senses the input voltage<br>
and does the processing using hardware logic and applies the required signal<br>
to switch on the correct relay to give the needed supply voltage to the<br>
electrical devise.<br>
3	A small bank of relays (say one to three generally), which get(s) activated by<br>
the populated PCB's hardware logic and deliver(s) the needed supply voltage<br>
to the electrical device. <br><br>
It has the following features (all of them or selectively some of them depending on the cost considerations)<br>
1	Buck facility (meaning that the input high voltage will be stepped down to the<br>
required working voltage of the devise)<br>
2	Boost facility (meaning that the input low voltage will be stepped up to the<br>
required working voltage of the devise)<br>
3	Send the input voltage directly to the output side if the input voltage is<br>
between 200 V AC to 240 V AC<br>
4	Intelligent Time delay - with by pass facility by way of a tactile switch<br>
5	Low voltage cut off<br>
6	High voltage cut off<br>
7	LED indicators for Tower on' condition, 'output on' condition, 'buck on' or<br>
'boost on' condition, and when the time delay action is on condition<br>
8	Output/input voltage measurement by way of providing a Voltmeter<br>
9	A mechanical switch to switch on the stabilizer<br>
As on date the voltage correction is solely based on the hardware logic of the PCB. It does not have any microprocessor or micro controller to perform the logical operations. (In layman terms, the present day stabilizers do not have any "computer" in them).<br>
If all the above said protections are to be provided, the stabiliser will have to have lot of electronic components (about say 150 components based on a particular designer's choice / design). As it is well know, that as the population of the discrete devices /electronic components increase the failure rate is bound to go up / increase.<br>
Also, commercially available / used electronic components tend to deteriorate over a period of time and the accuracy of the stabiliser is not the same as it was at the time of manufacture. This is especially true for the ITD (intelligent time delay function) as it is dependent on a electrolytic capacitor and this capacitor will loose its capacitance over a period of time. Hence, the time delay set at say 3 minutes in the factory at the time of manufacture, may well become either less or more depending on the capacitor's performance.<br>
It is well known that, all the mathematical calculations and logic are handled more efficiently and superiorly by a computer (in our case a micro controller / microprocessor); may it be a small hand held / pocket calculator or a computer for more complex calculations. These devices have a microprocessor to perform the required tasks.<br><br>
As on date the stabilizers in the market (especially the first mentioned type) lack in accuracy to give the output voltage. Say, the stabilizer specifies as under:<br>
Input voltage - 170 volts to 270 volts Ouput voltage - 200 to 240 volts +/- 20%<br>
This means that the stabilizer will work from an input voltage of 170 volts to 270 volts and will give an output voltage of 200 to 240 volts in the range of +/- 20% .<br>
While the input voltage is sensed, there is lack of accuracy in sensing the same most of the times and the output relays get activated only after the input voltage reaches say 175 volts on the lower side and say 275 or 280 volts on the higher side. This means the accuracy of the stabilizer is at stake. This happens very much with passing of time and due to ageing of the components errors in sensing creep in.<br>
One of the ways to eliminate the errors is to use less number of components and to use a "embedded software" based logical system to drive the relays. As even with passing of time the soft ware loaded on to the microprocessor or micro controller does not get 'aged'<br>
One can continuously scan the input voltage signals (to the order of milli seconds if not in micro seconds), run periodically the software program to correct the input voltage and give the correct output voltage.<br>
By using a microprocessor or a micro controller the total number of components will get decreased and also we are building some intelligence into the device. I propose to use latest technology called surface mount technology / devices (short form SMT or SMD) which will greatly reduce the footprint of the PCB (or even the older type of leaded type of components). These SMD components do not have the leads and are mounted flat on to the surface of the PCB.<br>
Time delay function (which is a must and should be accurate to the maximum extent for some devices like Air conditioners, refrigerators, deep freezers, bottle coolers and for some type of medical equipments), can be set very precisely and accurately as we can count up to milliseconds using a micro controller or a microprocessor.<br>
The low voltage and high voltage cut off also can be programmed to perform precisely as the voltage can be sensed even if needed up to milli volts.<br>
All these features prima facie do not seem to be of much consequence to a common man (or for even professional electrical engineers), as they may argue that such precision is not required for latest devices as they are meant to operate from 170 volts to 270 volts either way. But that be the case no one should use any stabilizers for any of the latest electrical or electronic devices/products and all the stabilizers should be rendered useless and no stabilizer be manufactured. <br><br>
This is not the case in vogue. Almost every one is locked on to use a stabilizer for their electrical devices whether by conviction or convention.<br>
All said and done, even the electrical product manufactures (who claim that their devices work from 170 to 270 volts) more often 'recommend' use of a stabilizer in view of the inherent safety it provides to their products. Especially the costly electronic equipments, which come into, the market needs to be 'guarded' from the vagaries of the power supply to see that they do not go for repairs at regular intervals due to the voltage fluctuations.<br>
By using a correct voltage to run the electrical device, the electrical device's / product's life period will certainly be extended / enhanced and the customer can derive the benefit of long life of the expensive products they buy from their hard earned money.<br>
If the purpose of a stabilizer is to provide a correct input voltage to the electrical device, it is logical to say that, that stabilizer should work accurately and precisely and give the right input voltage to the electrical gadget.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PCB PHOTOS / SCHEMATIC DRAWINGS.<br>
Photo 1 and Schematic 1 shows the existing peb layout / electronic circuit which is being used to achieve all the desired functions as enumerated above.<br>
Photo 2 and schematic 2 shows the revised and modified peb lay out / electronic circuit which is made by using the micro controller / microprocessor.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiments:<br>
As seen from the Photo 1 and schematic 1 the PCB and the circuit are too complex and with too many electronic components.<br>
Where as seen from Photo 2 and schematic 2 the peb and the circuit diagram are reduced almost to l/3rd or 1/2 of the original size, but which will out perform the original circuit / PCB due to various factors mentioned in my invention above.<br>
So by using a micro controller / microprocessor, the electronic voltage stabiliser will not only use less components, but also will improve its performance many folds and will prove to be more accurate. <br><br>
How is it different from the existing products:<br>
As exhaustively mentioned above, the present day products / Automatic Electronic Voltage stabilisers (referred as "product" below) use only conventional components like ICs, discreet devices like resistors, diodes, RLC network to correct the input voltage to give a "stabilsed'Voltage at the output / to the consumer goods being used.<br>
With this invention, the use of such components is reduced to a very large extent and the desired correction of voltage done by components is replaced by use of embedded software on a micro controller. A micro controller can perform the desired corrections more accurately and more efficiently and with out any "drift" associated with the electronic components over a period of time. Hence the product's performance will remain "static" over the lifetime of the product's use unless some extraneous conditions alter the software on the micro controller.<br>
Inventive steps in the art / technology<br>
The main inventive step in this technology is the use of the latest state of the art electronic component called the Micro controller - which basically is an IC with an inbuilt ROM and Flash memory - which means that it is a "miniature computer" which can perform mathematical functions as per the programme loaded into its flash memory.<br>
No body has yet harnessed this technology for the use in this type of products - viz., electronic automatic voltage stabilisers.<br>
Utility value and advantages of the invention<br>
Utility value would be by way of latest technology reaching the common house hold in the use of common place gadgets like automatic stabiliser.<br>
The advantages of the invention is in two ways - one - the product will perform much better and superiorly in comparison to the existing ones in the market.<br>
Two - During production and in maintaining the inventory the same populated PCB with the micro controller will be useful right from 300 VA stabiliser to 5 KVA stabiliser, without much changes in the hardware or in the embedded software.<br><br><br>
Non obvious issue<br>
The product Automatic Electronic Voltage stabiliser is a general product and is used where ever there are compressors and voltage sensitive electrical devices.<br>
As such the product now conceived and developed performs all the functions of the existing products but with much more accuracy and compactness. Major hardware driven logic is substituted by embedded software and the same pcb can be made use of extensive range right from 300 VA to 5 KVA, without much changes.<br>
On the other hand with the existing designs using fully hardware driven logic, each type of rating and specification will have a different pcb and circuitry.<br>
Hence the product is a general purpose one and is not specific to one type of stabiliser. Advantages:<br>
Compact design of the PCB<br>
More efficient functioning due to reduced components<br>
Uses the state of the art and contemporary technology of Micro controller for day to day<br>
product - which means the latest technology will reach the masses and by which better<br>
product will be delivered to the user / consumer. In layman terms the main controlling<br>
unit in the voltage stabiliser is "computer controlled"<br>
High repeatability even after many years due to software driven design</td>
