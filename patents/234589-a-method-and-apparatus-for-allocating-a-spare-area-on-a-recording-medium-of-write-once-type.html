				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ALLOCATING A<br>
SPARE AREA ON A RECORDING MEDIUM OF WRITE-<br>
ONCE TYPE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for allocating a spare area on a<br>
recording medium of write-once type and, generally relates to a write-once optical disc, and<br>
more particularly, to an apparatus and method for allocating a spare area on a write-once<br>
optical disc such as a write-once blu-ray disc.<br>
Background Art<br>
A new type of high-density optical disc such as a Blu-ray Disc Rewritable<br>
(BD-RE) is being developed. A benefit of the BD-RE is that it has a rewritable<br>
capability where the quality video and audio data can be written, erased and<br>
rewritten thereon repeatedly.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a general optical disc device for<br>
writing/reproducing data to/from an optical disc such as a BD-RE. As shown<br>
in FIG. 1, the optical disc device includes an optical pickup 11 for<br>
recording/reproducing a signal to/from a BD-RE 10, a video disc recorder<br>
(VDR) system 12 for processing a signal from the optical pickup 11 as a<br>
reproduced signal, or demodulating and processing an external data stream into a<br>
writable signal suitable for writing onto the BD-RE 10, and an encoder 13 for<br>
encoding an external analog signal and providing the encoded signal to the VDR<br>
system 12.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a structure of a general BD-RE. Referring to FIG. 2, an<br>
LIA (lead-in area), a data area and an LOA (lead-out area) are allocated on the<br>
BD-RE. An ISA (inner spare area) and an OSA (outer spare area) are allocated<br>
separately to a front and a rear end of the data area. A user data area having an<br>
LSN (Logical Sector Number) is allocated between the ISA and the OSA of the<br>
data area.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the VDR system 12 writes input data from an<br>
external source in a cluster unit corresponding ECC block having a<br>
predetermined recording capacity after encoding and converting the input data<br>
into a recording signal. The VDR system 12 also detects a defective area<br>
within the data area when recording the data.<br>
When a defective area is detected, the VDR system 12 performs a<br>
replacement writing operation to write the cluster data from the defective area<br>
onto the ISA instead. After the data writing is finished, location information of<br>
the defective area and management information for reproducing the chaster data<br>
written on the spare area (replacement area) are written as a defect list onto the<br>
LIA.<br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a general structure of a BD-RE single layer<br>
and a BD-RE dual layer, respectively. As shown, a BD-RE may have a single<br>
recording layer (FIG. 3 A) or two recording layers (FIG. 3B).<br>
Referring to FIG. 3A, the recording capacity of the inner spare area ISA<br>
being allocated to the BD-RE single layer is 2048 clusters, and the recording<br>
capacity of the outer spare area OSA is N x 256 (0=<n clusters with a></n>
maximum of 16384 clusters. The recording capacity of the data area of the<br>
BD-RE single layer is 355603 clusters. The recording capacity of the user data<br>
area of the BD-RE single layer is determined to be a difference between the<br>
recording capacity of the data area and the recording capacity of the spare areas.<br>
For example, when the recording capacity of the outer spare area is 16384<br>
clusters (N=64), then the recording capacity of the user data area is 337171<br>
clusters. As a result, the size of the inner and outer spare areas (18432 = 2048<br>
+ 16384) corresponds to 5.5% of the size of the user data area of the BD-RE<br>
single layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3B, in the BD-RE dual layer, the recording capacity of<br>
the inner spare area (ISAO) of a first layer (Layer 0) is 2048 clusters. The<br>
recording capacity of the outer spare area (OSA0) of the first layer is N x 256<br>
clusters (0=<n with the maximum clusters on other></n>
hand, the recording capacity of the inner spare area (ISA1) of a second layer<br>
(Layer 1) is L x 256 clusters (0=<l with the maximum clusters></l>
(L=64). The recording capacity of the outer spare area (OSA1) of the second<br>
layer is N x 256 clusters (0=<n with the maximum clusters></n>
As a result, the total recording capacity of the spare areas of the first and second<br>
layers is calculated to be 5.1% of the total recording capacity of the user data<br>
areas of the first and second layers.<br>
A Blu-ray Disc Write-Once (BD-WO) is another type of high density<br>
optical disc that is being developed where a high quality of data can be recorded<br>
and reproduced to and from the disc. As the name may suggest, data can be<br>
written only once on the BD-WO and is not rewritable on the BD-WO. But the<br>
BD-WO can be read repeatedly. As a result, the BD-WO is useful where the<br>
rewritability of data on a recording medium is not desired.<br>
Recently, standardizing the size of the BD-WO is being considered But<br>
allocating the spare areas of the BD-WO as in the BD-RE would cause a<br>
problem of wasting precious recording space due to the characteristics of the<br>
BD-WO. For instance, in the BD-RE the recording capacity of the spare areas<br>
should be allocated large enough since the BD-RE re-records data repeatedly<br>
and as a result many defective areas can surface. In contrast, BD-WO is able to<br>
write once and thus relatively less defective areas may be present Therefore, it<br>
is not necessary and is wasteful to allocate the same amount of spare area of the<br>
BD-RE onto the BD-WO.<br>

Best mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout me drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
Hereinafter, the embodiments of the method of allocating a spare area on<br>
a write-once type optical disc such as BD-WO are explained in details according<br>
to the present invention in reference with drawings. The present method can be<br>
applied in the process of manufacturing a write-once BD-WO single layer and a<br>
write-once ED-WO dual layer. Considering the characteristics of data<br>
recording on the BD-WO, die maximum size of the spare area can be allocated<br>
which is smaller man the maximum size of the spare areas allocated to a BD-RE.<br>
In the present invention, the recording capacity of the spare<br>
area(s)/replacement area(s) of a BD-WO is kept at less than about 5% of the<br>
recording capacity of the user data area. In the present application, the<br>
recording size of an area (assuming with no defects) means the size of the area.<br>
As such, these two terms are interchangeably used herein. As an example only,<br>
an embodiment of allocating the recording capacity of the spare area(s) to about<br>
3% of the recording capacity of the user data area on the BD-WO will be now<br>
explained as follows.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a BD-WO single layer and a method of<br>
allocating a spare area thereon according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the BD-WO single layer includes a single recording<br>
layer allocated with an LIA, a data area and an LOA. The data area includes a<br>
user data area having a logical sector number (LSN), and an inner spare area<br>
and/or an outer spare area for writing data of defective areas (i.e., as a<br>
replacement area). The recording capacity of the inner spare area (ISA) is<br>
allocated to be of a predetermined fixed value (e.g., 2048 clusters), and the<br>
recording capacity of the outer spare area (OSA) is variable, e.g., N x 256<br>
clusters (0=<n with the maximum clusters></n>
The recording capacity of the data area of the BD-WO single layer is<br>
allocated to have 355603 clusters. The recording capacity of the user data area<br>
is obtained by subtracting the recording capacity of the spare areas (ISA and<br>
OSA) from the recording capacity of the data area. For example, when the<br>
recording capacity of the outer spare area OSA is at the maximum 8192 clusters<br>
(N=32), the recording capacity of the user data area is calculated to be 34563<br>
(=355603-(2048+8192)) clusters. As a result, the recording capacity of the<br>
inner and outer spare areas (10240 = 2048+8192) of the BD-WO single layer<br>
according to this embodiment is about 3% of the recording capacity (size) of the<br>
user data area (345 63 clusters) of the BD-WO single layer.<br>
Accordingly, when the recording capacity of the inner and outer spare<br>
areas allocated to the BD-WO single layer is adjusted to be about 3% of the<br>
recording capacity of the user data area by varying the maximum recording<br>
capacity of the outer spare area, the spare areas of the BD-WO are prevented<br>
from being wasted and are efficiently allocated<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a structure of a BD-WO dual layer and a method of<br>
allocating a spare area thereon according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the BD-WO dual layer includes a first recording<br>
layer (Layer 0) and a second recording layer (Layer 1). The first recording<br>
layer (Layer 0) includes a LIA, a data area 32a, and an outer zone area (Outer<br>
Zone 0). The data area 32a includes an inner spare area (ISA0), a user data<br>
area 33a, and an outer spare area (OSA0). The second recording layer (Layer<br>
1) includes a LOA, a data area 32b, and an outer zone area (Outer Zone 1). The<br>
data area 32b of the second layer includes an inner spare area (ISA1), a user data<br>
area 33b, and an outer spare area (OSA1). A data writing operation occurs<br>
generally in the direction shown with the dotted arrow A.<br>
The inner spare area (ISA0) on the first layer has a predermined fixed<br>
size, e.g., 2048 clusters. The recording capacity of me outer spare area (OSAO)<br>
on 1he first layer is variable and is N x 256 clusters (0=<n with the></n>
maximum 4096 clusters (N=16). The recording capacity of the inner spare area<br>
(ISA1) on the second layer is variable and is L x 256 clusters (0=<n with></n>
the maximum 8192 clusters (L-32). The recording capacity of the outer spare<br>
area (OSA1) on the second layer is variable and is N x 256 clusters (0=s<l></l>
with the maximum 4096 clusters (N=16). The total recording capacity of the<br>
first and second data areas 32a and 32b is 711206 (- 355603 x 2) clusters.<br>
The total recording capacity of the user data areas on the first and second<br>
layers is calculated by subtracting the total recording capacity of the spare<br>
areas from the total recording capacity of the data areas of the first and second<br>
layers. For example, if bom recording capacities of the first and second outer<br>
areas (OSA0 and OSA1) are at maximum 4096 clusters (N=16) and the<br>
recording capacity of the inner spare area (OSA1) of the second layer is at<br>
maximum 8192 clusters (L=32), then the total recording capacity of the user data<br>
areas of the first and second layers becomes 692774 clusters ( =(355603 x 2)-<br>
(2048+4096+4096+8192)). As a result, the total capacity of the spare areas of<br>
the first and second layers (2048+4096+4096+8192 clusters) corresponds to<br>
about 3% of the total recording capacity of the user data areas cu the first and<br>
second layers.<br>
Accordingly, the total recording capacity of the first and second inner and<br>
outer spare areas allocated to the BD-WO dual layer becomes about 3% of the<br>
total recording capacity of the user data areas by adjusting the maximum<br>
recording capacity of the first and second outer spare areas (OSA0, OSA1) and<br>
the maximum recording capacity of the second inner spare area (ISA1).<br>
Therefore, the spare areas are prevented from being wasted and are efficiently<br>
allocated in accordance with the data recording characteristics of the BD-WO.<br>
In the first embodiment as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the entire spare areas<br>
(e.g., toner spare areas and outer spare areas) are used as replacement areas for<br>
storing data of defective areas according to a linear replacement scheme. For<br>
instance, if a cluster area of a user data area is found to be defective, then the<br>
data stored in that defective cluster area is also written onto a spare area<br>
functioning as a replacement area for the defective cluster area.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a structure a BD-WO single layer and a method for<br>
assigning a spare area on the BD-WO single layer according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The BD-WO single layer shown in FIG.<br>
6 includes a lead-in area, a data area, and a lead-out area. The data area has a<br>
fixed size, e.g., 355603 clusters.<br>
The lead-in area includes first and second defect management areas<br>
DMA1 and DMA2, and a temporary defect management area TDMA. TDMA<br>
is an area to temporarily record and manage defect management information of<br>
the BD-WO until the BD-WO is finalized For instance, if during a writing<br>
operation of the user data area, if data in a defective cluster area of the user data<br>
area is written onto a part (replacement area) of a spare area according to a linear<br>
replacement scheme, then information (e.g., location information, size, etc.) of<br>
the defective cluster area and the corresponding replacement area within the<br>
spare area is temporarily stored in the TDMA as TDMA information. Then if<br>
the BD-WO is to be finalized (e.g., upon completion of the data writing onto the<br>
user data area), then the TDMA information stored in the TDMA is transferred<br>
to one or each of the DMAs allocated on the BD-WO. In this example, the<br>
TDMA provided in the lead-in area has a fixed size, for example, 2048 clusters.<br>
The data area includes an inner spare area ISA, a user data area 34, and<br>
an outer spare area OSA. In this example, the entire inner spare area ISA is<br>
used as an area for linear replacement (i.e., as a replacement area). In other<br>
words, an area for temporary defect management is not allocated to the inner<br>
spare area ISA. Generally, the ISA has a fixed size (e.g., 2048 clusters) and the<br>
OSA has a variable size.<br>
The outer spare area OSA includes an interim defect management area<br>
(IDMA) and a replacement area 40 for linear replacement In one example, the<br>
IDMA is allocated adjacent to the replacement area 40. The size of the IDMA<br>
is allocated variably depending on the size of the outer spare area OSA. Since<br>
the outer spare area OSA has a variable size, the IDMA also has a variable size.<br>
Here, the IDMA is distinguished from the TDMA having a fixed size in<br>
the lead-in area in that it has a variable size and may differ from the TDMA<br>
depending on a usage manner in recorded timing. However, the TDMA and the<br>
IDMA can store the same contents despite the difference between the terms.<br>
This will be described later.<br>
In one example, the IDMA having a variable size is allocated within the<br>
outer spare area OSA depending on whether or not the outer spare area OSA is<br>
allocated. For instance, if the outer spare area OSA is allocated, then the<br>
IDMA is allocated therein as discussed herein. But if the outer spare area OSA<br>
is not allocated, then the IDMA may not be allocated and only the TDMA<br>
having a fixed size may be allocated as discussed herein, kt another variation,<br>
the outer spare area OSA may be allocated without the allocation of the IDMA<br>
therein. However, if the outer spare area OSA is allocated, it is preferable to<br>
allocate the IDMA therein.<br>
The size of the IDMA positioned at the outer track of the disc depends on<br>
the variable size of the outer spare area OSA. In one example, the size of the<br>
outer spare area OSA is N ' 256 clusters (0 = N = 64). In this case, the<br>
size of the IDMA can be P ' 256 clusters, where P is an integer determined to<br>
be P = N/4. That is, a method wherein the size of the IDMA is allocated to be a<br>
quarter of the size of the outer spare area OSA can be used in determining the<br>
size of the IDMA. For example, if N = 64 is used, then the size of the outer<br>
spare area OSA is allocated to be 16384 clusters (16384 = 64 x 256) and P = N/4<br>
= 16. As a result, the size of the IDMA according to the present invention is<br>
allocated to be 4096 clusters (4096 = 16 x 256).<br>
Similarly, the size of the IDMA may be varied depending on the size of<br>
the outer spare area OSA considering that when the replacement area for linear<br>
replacement is allocated in the OSA, the size of the replacement area, the size of<br>
the DMA, and the size of the spare area(s) depend on one another. In contrast,<br>
the size of the disk inner track area (especially the size of the TDMA positioned<br>
in the lead-in area) has a fixed value.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a structure of a BD-WO dual layer and a method of<br>
allocating a spare area on the BD-WO dual layer according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the BD-WO dual layer includes a first layer (Layer<br>
0) and a second layer (Layer 1). The first layer (Layer 0) includes a lead-in<br>
area, a data area 35a and an outer zone area Outer Zone 0. The second layer<br>
(Layer 1) includes a lead-out area, a data area 35b and an outer zone area Outer<br>
Zonel.<br>
In each of the lead-in area and lead-out area, a TDMA of the present<br>
invention is provided as first and second TDMAs 37a and 37b, and a plurality of<br>
DMAs are provided. A plurality of DMAs are also provided in each of the<br>
Outer Zones 0 and 1. Each TDMA provided in the lead-in area and the lead-<br>
out area has a fixed size, for example, 2048 clusters.<br>
The first data area 35a of the first layer (Layer 0) includes an inner spare<br>
area ISAO, a user data area 36a, and an outer spare area OSA0. The inner spare<br>
area ISAO has a fixed size (e.g., 2048 clusters) and the outer spare area OSA0<br>
has a variable size. Here, the entire ISAO is used as a replacement area for linear<br>
replacement The OSA0 includes a replacement area 38d for linear replacement<br>
and a first IDMA 38a for storing therein IDMA information for defect<br>
management That is, an area for temporary defect management is not<br>
allocated to the inner spare area ISAO of the first layer (Layer 0).<br>
The second data area 35b of the second layer (Layer 1) includes an inner<br>
spare area ISA1, a user data area 36b, and an outer spare area OSA1. Each of<br>
the inner and outer spare areas ISA1 and OSA1 has a variable size. Each of the<br>
inner and outer spare areas ISA1 and OSA1 includes a replacement area 38f or<br>
38g for linear replacement and an IDMA 38b or 38c for storing therein IDMA<br>
information for defect management In one example, the IDMAs 38a-38c are<br>
each allocated to a portion adjacent to the corresponding replacement area for<br>
linear replacement. The size of the IDMAs is allocated depending on the size<br>
of the spare areas ISA1, OSA0 and OSA1 where the spare areas ISA1, OSAO<br>
and OSA1 have a variable size.<br>
Here, the IDMAs 38a-38c are allocated within the spare areas depending<br>
on whether or not the corresponding spare areas area allocated. For instance, if<br>
a spare area is allocated to the BD-WO, then the corresponding IDMA may be<br>
allocated therein. But if a spare area is not allocated, then the corresponding<br>
IDMA may not be allocated therein and only the TDMA(s) having a fixed size<br>
may be allocated. In one example, if the BD-WO has been allocated with the<br>
ISAO and not with the ISA1, the OSAO and/or the OSA1, men only the first<br>
TDMA 37a may be allocated and the second TDMA 37b and the IDMAs 38a-<br>
38c may not be allocated to the BD-WO. In another example, if the ISAO and<br>
ISA1 (and not the OSAO and OSA1) are allocated to the BD-WO, then the<br>
TDMAs 37a and 37b and the IDMA 38b (not the IDMAs 38a and 38c) may be<br>
allocated. In still another example, the IDMA may not be allocated within the<br>
corresponding spare area even if the corresponding spare area is allocated to the<br>
BD-WO. For instance, even if the ISAO, OSAO and OSA1 are allocated to the<br>
BD-WO, the corresponding IDMAs 38a and 38c may not be allocated therein.<br>
It should be noted that one or more of the ISAO, the OSAO (with or without the<br>
IDMA 38a), the OSA1 (with or without the IDMA 38c), and the ISA1 (with or<br>
without die IDMA 38b) may be allocated to the BD-WO with one or more of the<br>
TDMAs.<br>
The size of the IDMAs may depend on the size of the spare areas ISA1,<br>
OSAO and OSA1. For example, the size of each of the outer spare areas OSAO<br>
and OSA1 is allocated to be N ' 256 clusters (0 ^ N ^ 32), and the size of<br>
the inner spare area ISA1 is allocated to be L ' 256 clusters (0 ^ L ^ 64).<br>
Then the size of each of the IDMAs 38a and 38c is allocated to be P ' 256<br>
clusters and the size of the IDMA 38b is allocated to be Q 256 clusters, where<br>
P and Q are integers determined to be P = N/4 and Q = L/4. Here a method<br>
wherein the size of the IDMA having a variable size is allocated to be a quarter<br>
of the size of the corresponding outer/inner spare area can be used.<br>
As an example, if N = 32 (max), then the size of the outer spare areas<br>
OSAO and OSA1 in total is 16384 clusters and P = N/4 = 8. As a result, the<br>
size of the IDMAs 38a and 38c in total is 4096 clusters. And if L = 64 (max),<br>
the size of the inner spare area ISA1 is 16384 clusters and Q = L/4 =16. As a<br>
result, the size of the IDMA 38b is allocated to be 4096 clusters. According to<br>
this example, the total maximum size of the data areas (35a and 35b) of the BD-<br>
WO dual layer is 711206 clusters, the total maximum size of the spare areas<br>
(ISA 0, ISA1, OSAO and OSA1) of the BD-WO dual layer is 34816 clusters, the<br>
total maximum size of the IDMAs (38a-38c) is 8192 clusters, the total maximum<br>
size of the replacement areas (ISAO, 38d, 38f and 38g) within the spare areas is<br>
26624 clusters, and the total size of the user data areas (36a and 36b) is 676390<br>
clusters. As a result, the total capacity (size) of the replacement areas (ISAO,<br>
38d, 38f and 38g) in the spare areas of the BD-WO dual layer corresponds to<br>
about 4% of the total recording capacity of the user data areas of the BD-WO<br>
dual layer.<br>
Here, the size of the IDMAs may vary depending on the size of the spare<br>
areas ISA1, OSAO and OSA1 considering that when a replacement area for<br>
linear replacement is allocated in the corresponding spare area, the size of the<br>
replacement area, the size of the IDMA(s) and the size of the spare area depend<br>
on one another. In contrast, the size of the inner track area (especially the<br>
TDMA positioned at each of the lead-in area and the lead-out area) has a fixed<br>
value.<br>
The arrows depicted in each of the areas shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 are<br>
examples of a data recording direction.<br>
According to the second embodiment as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, if a<br>
defective area within the user data area is detected during a data writing<br>
operation of the BD-WO, the data written or to be written to the defective area is<br>
written to a replacement area of a spare area according to the linear replacement<br>
Information pertaining to the defective area and the replacement area and any<br>
other information is written onto the TDMA(s) and IDMA(s) allocated on<br>
specific areas of the disc. The same defect management information may be<br>
written to each of the TDMA(s) and IDMA(s). In the alternative, if the TDMA<br>
of a layer is full, men the IDMA(s) of the same or different layer may be used, or<br>
if an IDMA of a layer is full, then the IDMA(s) of the same or different layer or<br>
the TDMA(s) of the same or different layer may be used.<br>
According to the second embodiment, in the BD-WO single layer, the<br>
entire ISA may be used as the area for linear replacement, whereas a portion of<br>
the OSA may be used as the IDMA and the remaining portion (or another<br>
. portion) of the OSA may be used as the area for linear replacement, hi the BD-<br>
WO dual layer, the entire ISAO may be used as the area for linear replacement,<br>
whereas portions of the ISA1, OSAO and OSA1 may be used as the IDMA(s)<br>
and the remaining portions (or other portions) of the ISA1, OSAO and OSA1<br>
may be used as die area for linear replacement<br>
FIG. 8 is an example of a block diagram of an optical disc<br>
recording/reproducing device 20 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
