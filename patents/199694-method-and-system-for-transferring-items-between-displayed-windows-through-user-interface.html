				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to system, which enables transfers of items between displayed windows in a single application, and between windows of differing applications through user interface. More particularly, the invention relates to a user interface for the Java language, which enables item transfers in an environment where "drag and drop" actions are not supported.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A "drag and drop" function is supported by many applications and enables data transfers across applications, between differing applications and within a single application. For example, the Windowsâ„¢ operating system (Windows is a trademark of Microsoft, Inc.) supports drag and drop actions as do other operating systems. A drag and drop interface enable a user to move, transfer and even convert objects by simply selecting them with a mouse and dragging their icon representations from one part of a screen to another. Dragging an object from one window to another window is typically interpreted by the control software as a request to move the object. Dragging an object's icon and dropping it onto another icon is interpreted by the control system as a request to join the two objects in some way, perhaps by supplying the dropped object as an input parameter to the target object, which may represent a program.<br>
The prior art, utilizing Windows-like applications employ drag and drop actions to create communication links by dragging an icon from one target hypertext document to a specified location in another hypertext document (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,595 to Centner). Other programs such as the SuperCede Database Edition 1.2, a database-oriented programming tool, provides a graphical user interface, which enables two-way editing. Essentially, the Supercede program is a tool for use with the Java language in the development of various business applications. However, the Java language does not, itself, currently support drag and drop operations.<br>
While the Java "tool kit" application programmer interface does not provide a built-in facility for building drag and drop interfaces, there is still a requirement for such functionality. Further, there still remains a class of users who find it difficult to work with a mouse and prefer to operate arrow keys on a computer keyboard to select items on a display screen.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a graphical user interface which enables movement of items between displayed windows.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for moving items between windows which can respond to either mouse inputs or manipulated arrow keys by moving a cursor and enabling a displayed item's selection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A computer implemented method is described for enabling a user to transfer, via a graphical user interface, an item from one displayed window to another displayed window. Initially, a first window is displayed with an item to be moved and a second window is displayed with one or more destinations to which the item can be moved. Thereafter, the user selects the item to be moved, causing a further window to be displayed which includes one or more commands, one of which manifests a movement action. Upon selection of the movement command, the graphical interface displays a list of destinations with which the item to be moved can be associated by actuating the movement command. Thereafter, responding to a selection of one of the displayed destinations, the computer, which operates the graphical view user interface, associates the item being moved with the selected destination and alters the display so that at least one of the displayed windows manifests the movement action.<br>
The instant invention provides a computer-implemented method for enabling a user to transfer, via a graphical user interface, an item from one displayed window to a destination in another displayed window.<br>
The instant invention also provides a memory media for controlling a computer to enable a user to transfer, via a graphical user interface, an item from one displayed window to a destination in another displayed window.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a computer 10 incorporates a central processing unit (CPU 12), a display 14, a mouse input 16 and a keyboard input 18, all of which are coupled by a bus system 20. A memory 22 includes various software procedures for operating computer 10 and among those is operating system 23, a display image generation procedure 24, a<br>
window creation procedure 26 and window contents lists 28. Further, an "add to" procedure 30 is stored in memory 22 and enables transfer of an item from a source window to a destination window, and more particularly, to an object within the destination window.<br>
Display image generation procedure 24 constructs window images in accordance with the results of an application being executed by CPU 12, under control of operating system 23. Within image generation procedure 24 is a window creation procedure 26 which creates the necessary code to cause display 14 to manifest windows with included data items such as folders, documents, tool bars, etc., etc. Further, as each window is created by procedure 26, a window contents list 28 is created with necessary pointers to the actual data underlying the listed item.<br>
"Add to" procedure 30 enables a selected item from a list in one window to be associated with a listed destination item in another window, but does not employ a drag and drop procedure of the prior art. More particularly, instantiation of the add-to procedure causes an additional window/menu/button to be displayed with a listing of the possible destinations for the item to be moved. Upon selection of a listed destination, the item to be moved is associated with the selected destination (e.g. via a pointer or other associating data construct). In addition, display 14 alters its image by moving the item to be moved to the window containing the destination and displays the item in its new locale.<br>
This action is illustrated in FIG. 2, where a window 100 includes two interior windows 102 and 104. Window 102 comprises a tree view of a plurality of folders and window 104 is a list view of three files. Assuming that it is desired to move file 2 to one of the folders in tree view window 102, the user, either by manipulation of a mouse or through use of up/down arrow keys, the tab key or an accelerator key to select file 2. That selection, in turn, causes a pop-up menu window 106 to appear. Window 106 provides plural options available to the user with respect to selected file 2. One of those options is an "add to" command that enables the movement of file 2 elsewhere within window 100 and, more particularly, to a location within tree view window 102.<br>
Upon selecting the "add to" command, a cascading pop-up menu 108 appears which lists the possible destinations to which file 2 can be transferred. Thereafter, the user selects one of the illustrated folders and file 2 is thereafter associated with the selected folder and, its image is moved to tree view window 102 beneath the selected folder.<br>
FIG. 3 provides a second embodiment of the invention wherein the list of optional commands with respect to a selected item in a window is displayed in response to a user selection of an item in menu bar 110. In this instance, a user selection of the "Edit" entry on tool bar 110 (after having selected file 2 in list view window 104) causes a drop down menu 112 to appear. Thereafter, the user uses the same procedure, as aforedescribed, to select the "add to" command which, in turn, causes a cascading menu 114 to appear which lists the possible destinations for selected file 2. Upon selecting one of folders 1-3, the file 2 item from window 104 appears in window 102 under the selected folder and appropriate pointers are associated with file 2 to link it to the selected folder.<br>
Turning to FIG. 4, a third embodiment of the invention utilizes a drop down button 116 to illustrate the various commands that are available when one of the files is selected in window 104. The available commands can be sequenced through drop down button 116 by actuation of either up or down arrow keys. One such command is the add-to command which, upon selection, causes display of drop down menu 118. Thereafter, the procedure followed to transfer file 2 to a selected folder in tree view window 2 is the same as described above.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, it may be the case that there are many listed possible destinations for an item, which destinations leave little room on the display to list additional destinations. In such case, lieu of displaying a window with all possible destinations, a further window is displayed which enables the user to type in a destination. More particularly, in the case shown in FIG. 5, window 100 includes a window 120 that is a tree view illustrating ten folders that comprise possible destinations for an item. A further window 122 enables entry of the name of another destination to which a particular item is to be moved.<br>
To cause the "Add to" window 100 to appear, either a pop-up menu 124, a drop down menu 126 or a button 128 can be used to institute the add-to procedure. In this case, the selection of the add-to command causes window 100 to be launched, enabling the user to enter the name of a destination.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6, a flow diagram is shown illustrating procedures employed by the embodiments of FIGS. 2-4. Initially, a source window with an item to be moved is displayed, as is a destination window (step 200). Thereafter, the user moves a cursor to the item to be moved (step 202) and assuming the item is selected (step 204), the procedure moves to one of steps 206, 208 or 210, depending upon which embodiment of the invention has been implemented. In any of the illustrated cases, an "add to" command is displayed and, upon its selection (step 212), causes a menu window to be displayed with possible destinations for the item to be moved (step 214). If there are more than 10 possible destinations, for example, the procedure moves to step 220 in FIG. 7 (to be described below).<br>
After a destination is selected (step 216), the selected item is associated with the selected destination and the window with the selected destination is altered to indicate the presence of the selected item (step 218).<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the procedure of the invention when the embodiment of FIG. 5 is employed. If step 213 determines that there are greater than 10 possible destinations, an "add to" entry window is displayed (step 220). Thereafter, the user enters the desired destination into the entry window or selects one of the possible destinations that are already displayed. Upon then selecting "OK" (step 222), the item is associated with the selected destination and the item is then displayed with the selected destination in the destination window (step 224).<br>
While the above description has assumed that all of the procedures required to implement the invention are already loaded into memory 22 (FIG. 1), such procedures may be stored on a memory media such as one or more magnetic diskettes 31, compact disks or other data storage media.<br>
It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances, which fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
