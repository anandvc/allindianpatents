				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of the general formula (I), their derivatives, their analogs, their stereoisomers, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions. The present invention more particularly provides novel heterocyclic compounds of the general formula (I).<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds of the formula (I), their derivatives, their analogs, their stereoisomers, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions.<br>
The novel compounds (I) of the present invention are useful for the treatment cancer, which is one of the leading causes of death in the present society. A great deal of effort has been underway to treat various forms of cancer for decades and until recently; chemo prevention of cancer is receiving its due share of attention.<br>
The first isolation of histone deacetylase was described in 1964 from crude nuclear extracts of cells, but the molecular characterization of isoforms of the enzyme has been achieved recently. Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC's) are zinc hydrolase's responsible for the deacetylation of N-acetyl lysine residues of histone and nonhistone protein substrates. Human HDAC's are classified into two distinct classes, the HDAC's and sirtuins. The HDAC's are devised into two subclasses based on their similarity to yeast histone deacetylases, RPD 3 (class I<br>
»<br>
includes HDAC 1, 2, 3, 8, and 11) and Hda 1 (class II includes HDAC 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10). All of the HDAC's have a highly conserved zinc dependent catalytic domain. There is growing evidence that the acetylation state of proteins and thus HDAC enzyme family plays a crucial role in the modulation of a number of biological processes, including transcription and the cell cycle.<br>
*<br>
Transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of a set of genes determines cell destination and for this reason transcription is tightly regulated by a variety of factors. One of its regulatory mechanisms involved in the process is an alteration in the tertiary structure of DNA, which affects transcription factors to their target DNA regiments. Nucleosomal integrity is regulated by the acetylating status of the core histone, with the result being permissiveness to transcription. The acetylating status of the histone is governed by the balance of the activities of the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Recently HDAC inhibitors have been found to arrest growth and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells, including colon cancer, t-cell lymphoma and erythroleukemic cells.<br>
Given that apoptosis is a crucial factor for cancer progression, HDAC inhibitors are promising reagents for cancer therapy as effective inducers of apoptosis.<br>
Several structural classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified and are reviewed in Marks, P.A. et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 92, (2000), 1210-1215. More specifically WO 98/55449 and US patent 5,369,108 report alkanoyl hydroxamates with HDAC inhibitory activity.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to potentially pharmaceutical compositions and in particular to new molecules as active ingredients, that are used in particular as anticancer agents. Compounds of the general formula (I) or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention have an ability of inhibiting histone deacetylating enzyme and of inducing differentiation and are useful as therapeutic or ameliorating agent for diseases that are involved in cellular growth such as malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, infections etc.<br>
Few prior art references, which disclose the closest compounds, are given here:<br>

wherein A represents a structure represented by any one of the following<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide formulations with increased solubility and improved oral absorptivity, for benzamide derivatives of the formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are useful as histone deacetylase inhibitors, and to provide injections containing the active ingredient at high concentrations.<br>
II.	US 6,174,905 B1 discloses the compounds of the formula (I), wherein A, X, Q, Rj, R2 and R3 are as described thereof. <br>
The novel benzamide derivative represented by formula (I) of this invention has differentiation-inducing effect, and are, therefore, useful as a therapeutic or improving agent for malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, dermatologic diseases and parasitism. In particular, they are highly effective as an anticancer drug, specifically to a hematological malignancy and a solid carcinoma.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
Due to unmet medical needs and also as all of us know, cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the present society, we focused our attention to identify novel small molecule anticancer agents, particularly focusing on HDAC inhibitors. Our sustained efforts have resulted in novel anticancer agents of the formula (I). Histone acetylation and deacetylation play an essential role in modifying chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Hyper acetylated histones are generally found in transcriptionally active genes and in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome. Key enzymes, which modify histone proteins and thereby regulate gene expression, are histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Compounds able to inhibit HDAC activity i.e. HDAC inhibitors such as Trichostatin A (TSA), Trapoxin (TPX), Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), Sodium butyrate (NaB), Sodium valproate (VPA), Cyclic hydroxamic acid containing peptides (CHAPs), Depsipeptide FK-228 and MS-275 can de-repress these genes, resulting in antiproliferative effects in vitro and anti tumor effects in vivo.<br>

To a suspension of 1,1 -carbonylbis( 1 H-imidazole) (6.48g, 40 mmol) in THF (30ml) at 0-5 °C was added pyridine-3-methanol (4.36 g, 40 mmol) in THF (13 ml), and stirred at room temperature for 5 hours. The above reaction mixture was added to a suspension of 2-amino-4-thiazole acetic acid (6.37 g, 40 mmol), DBU (6.08 g, 40 mmol) and triethylamine (4.04 g, 40 mmol) in THF (63 ml) and stirred at room temperature, overnight. The THF was removed under reduced pressure and the crude compound was taken in dichloromethane (200 ml), washed with water, and the aqueous layer was acidified to a pH of 6 to afford a pale yellow colored precipitate which was filtered and dried to give the title compound (2.7 g, 25% yield).

Preparation of pyridin-3-ylmethyl [4-(2-morphoIin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl)-l,3- thiazol-2-y(]carbamate:<br><br>
To a suspension of (2-{[(pyridin-3-ylmethoxy)carbonyl]amino}-l,3- thiazol-4-yl)acetic acid (0.293 g, 1 mmol) in THF (5 ml) was added DIPEA (0.4 mL, 2.4 mmol), EDCI (0.3 g, 1.6 mmol), HOBt (0.043 g, 0.32 mmol) followed by the morpholine (0.07 g, 0.8 mmol. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The THF was removed under reduced pressure and the crude was taken up in EtOAc (50 ml) and washed with water, the organic layer was dried on anhydrous Na2SC&gt;4, concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography, using dichlormethane/MeOH (98:2) to afford 0.1 g (35 % yield) of the title compound as pale yellow colored solid with m.p. 163-165 °C. *H NMR (400 MHz, CDC13) 5 (ppm): 3.50-3.51(2H, d, -CH2), 3.56-3.63 (2H, m, -CH2), 3.72 (4H, s, -CH2), 3.88 (2H, s, CH2), 5.30 (2H, s, -OCH2), 6.73 (1H, s, Ar-H), 7.36 (1H, s, Ar-H), 7.76-7.78 (1H, d, Ar-H), 8.65-8.71(2H, d, Ar-H), 9.21(1H, s, D20 exchangeable).

Anti-cancer experimental methods<br>
Anti-cancer screen:<br>
Experimental drugs are screened for anti-cancer activity in three cell lines for their GI50, TGI and LC50 values (using five concentrations for each compound). The cell lines are maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 96 well micro titer plates are inoculated with cells in 100 ^L for 24 hours at 37°C, 5% C02,95% air and 100% relative humidity. 5000 HCT 116 cells/well, 5000 NCIH 460 cells/well and 5000 U251 cells/well are plated. A separate plate with these cell lines is also inoculated to determine cell viability before the addition of the compounds (T0).<br>
Addition of experimental drugs:<br>
Following 24-hour incubation, experimental drugs are added to the 96 well plates. Each plate contains one of the above cell lines and the following in triplicate: five different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 jiM) of four different compounds, appropriate dilutions of a cytotoxic standard and control (untreated) wells. Compounds are dissolved in DMSO to make 20 mM stock solutions on the day of drug addition and frozen at -20°C. Serial dilutions of these 20 mM stock solutions are made in complete growth medium such that 100 pL of these drug solutions in medium, of final concentrations equaling 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 JIM can be added to the cells in triplicate. Standard drugs whose anti- t	J<br>
cancer activity has been well documented and which are regularly used are doxorubicin and SAHA.<br>
End-point measurement:<br>
For T0 measurement, 24 hours after seeding the cells, 10 |iL of 3-(4,5- Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolixim (MTT) solution per well is added and incubation carried out for 3 hours at 37°C, 5% C02,95% air and 100% relative humidity, protected from light. Cells incubated with compounds for 48 hours are treated similarly except with the addition of 20jil MTT solution per well and a subsequent incubation under the same conditions. After 3 hours of MTT incubation, well contents are aspirated carefully followed by addition of 150 \iL DMSO per well. Plates are agitated to ensure solution of the formazan crystals in DMSO and absorbance read at 570 rnn.<br>
Calculation ofGW TGI and LC«.:<br>
Percent growth is calculated for each compound's concentration relative to the control and zero measurement wells (T0; viability right before compound addition).<br>
If a test well's O.D. value is greater than the To measurement for that cell line % Growth = (test - zero) / (control - zero) X 100<br>
If a test well's O.D. value is lower than the To measurement for that cell line, then, % Growth = (test - zero) / zero X 100<br>
Plotting % growth versus experimental drug concentration, GI50 is the concentration required to decrease % growth by 50%; TGI is the concentration required to decrease % growth by 100% and LC50 is the concentration required to decrease	%	growth	by	150%. <br>
