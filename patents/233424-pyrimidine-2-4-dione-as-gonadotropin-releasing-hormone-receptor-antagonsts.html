				<td> STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST<br>
Partial funding of the work described herein was provided by the U.S. Government under Grant No. 1-R43-HD38625 and 2R44-HD3 8625-02 provided by the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists, and to methods of treating disorders by administration of such antagonists to a warm-blooded animal in need thereof.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a decapeptide (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) that plays an important role in human reproduction. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary gland to stimulate the biosynthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH released from the pituitary gland is responsible for the regulation of gonadal steroid production in both males and females, while FSH regulates spermatogenesis in males and follicular development in females.<br>
Due to its biological importance, synthetic antagonists and agonists to GnRH have been the focus of considerable attention, particularly in the context of prostate cancer, breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine leiomyoma (fibroids), ovarian cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, assisted reproductive therapy, and precocious puberty<br><br>
(The Lancet 358:1793-1803, 2001; Mol. Cell. Endo. 166:9-14, 2000). For example, peptidic GnRH agonists, such as leuprorelin (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-d-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt), have been used to treat such conditions. Such agonists appear to function by binding to the GnRH receptor in the pituitary gonadotropins, thereby inducing the synthesis and release of gonadotropins. Chronic administration of GnRH agonists depletes gonadotropins and subsequently down-regulates the receptor, resulting in suppression of steroidal hormones after some period of time (e.g., on the order of 2-3 weeks following initiation of chronic administration).<br>
In contrast, GnRH antagonists are believed to suppress gonadotropins from the onset, and thus have received the most attention over the past two decades. To date, some of the primary obstacles to the clinical use of such antagonists have been their relatively low bioavailability and adverse side effects caused by bistamine release. However, several peptidic antagonists with low histamine release properties have been reported, although they still must be delivered via sustained delivery routes (such as subcutaneous injection or intranasal spray) due to limited bioavailability.<br>
In view of the limitations associated with peptidic GnRH antagonists, a number of nonpeptidic compounds have been proposed. For example, Cho et al. (J. Med. Chem. 41:4190-4195, 1998) discloses thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-4-ones for use as GnRH receptor antagonists; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,780,437 and 5,849,764 teach substituted indoles as GnRH receptor antagonists (as do published PCTs WO 97/21704, 98/55479, 98/55470, 98/55116, 98/55119, 97/21707, 97/21703 and 97/21435); published PCT WO 96/38438 discloses tricyclic diazepines as GnRH receptor antagonists; published PCTs WO97/14682, 97/14697 and 99/09033 disclose quinoline and thienopyridine derivatives as GnRH antagonists; published PCTs WO 97/44037, 97/44041, 97/44321 and 97/44339 teach substituted quinolin-2-ones as GnRH receptor antagonists; and published PCT WO 99/33831 discloses certain phenyl-substituted fused nitrogen-containing bicyclic compounds as GnRH receptor antagonists. Recently published PCTs WO 02/066459 and WO 02/11732 disclose the use of indole derivatives and novel bicyclic and tricyclic pyrrolidine derivatives as GnRH antagonists, respectively. 30 Other recently published PCTs which disclose compounds and their use as GnRH<br>
antagonists include WO 00/69859, WO 01/29044, WO 01/55119, WO 03/013528, WO 03/011870, WO 03/011841, WO 03/011839 and WO 03/011293.<br>
While significant strides have been made in this field, there remains a need in the art for effective small molecule GnRH receptor antagonists. There is also a need for pharmaceutical compositions containing such GnRH receptor antagonists, as well as methods relating to the use thereof to treat, for example, sex-hormone related conditions. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In brief, this invention is generally directed to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists, as well as to methods for then* preparation and use, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. More specifically, the GnRH receptor antagonists of this invention are compounds having the following general structure (I): (Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
including  stereoisomers, prodrugs  and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein Ria, Rib, Raa, Rab, Ra, R4, RS, Re, R? and X are as defined below.<br>
The GnRH receptor antagonists of this invention have utility over a wide range of therapeutic applications, and may be used to treat a variety of sex-hormone related conditions in both men and women, as well as a mammal in general (also referred to herein as a "subject"). For example, such conditions include endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovarian disease, hirsutism, precocious puberty, gonadal<br>
steroid-dependent neoplasia such as cancers of the prostate, breast and ovary, gonadotrophe pituitary adenomas, sleep apnea, irritable bowel syndrome, premenstrual syndrome, benign prostatic hypertrophy, contraception and infertility (e.g., assisted reproductive therapy such as in vitro fertilization). The compounds of this invention are also useful as an adjunct to treatment of growth hormone deficiency and short stature, and for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosis. The compounds are also useful in combination with androgens, estrogens, progesterones, and antiestrogens and antiprogestogens for the treatment of endometriosis, fibroids, and in contraception, as well as in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, or a renin inhibitor for the treatment of uterine fibroids. In addition, the compounds may be used in combination with bisphosphonates and other agents for the treatment and/or prevention of disturbances of calcium, phosphate and bone metabolism, and in combination with estrogens, progesterones and/or androgens for the prevention or treatment of bone loss or hypogonadal symptoms such as hot flashes during therapy with a GnRH antagonist.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, in addition to their GnRH receptor antagonist activity, possess a reduced interaction with the major metabolic enzymes in the liver, namely the Cytochrome P450 enzymes. This family of enzymes, which includes the subtypes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, is responsible for the metabolism of drugs and toxins leading to their disposition from the body. Inhibition of these enzymes can lead to life-threatening conditions where the enzyme is not able to perform this function.<br>
The methods of this invention include administering an effective amount of a GnRH receptor antagonist, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, to a mammal in need thereof. Thus, in still a further embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed containing one or more GnRH receptor antagonists of this invention in combination with a phannaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent upon reference to the following detailed description. To this end, various references are set forth herein<br>
which describe in more detail certain background information, procedures, compounds and/or compositions, and are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may generally be utilized as the free acid or free base. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in the form of acid or base addition salts. Acid addition salts of the free amino compounds of the present invention may be prepared by methods well known in the art, and may be fonned from organic and inorganic acids. Suitable organic acids include maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, methanesulfonic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, oxalic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, mandelic, cinnamic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, glycolic, glutamic, and benzenesulfonic acids. Suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, and nitric acids. Base addition salts included those salts that form with the carboxylate anion and include salts fonned with organic and inorganic cations such as those chosen from the alkali and alkaline earth metals (for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, barium and calcium), as well as the ammonium ion and substituted derivatives thereof (for example, dibenzylammonium, benzylammonium, 2-hydroxyethylammonium, and the like). Thus, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" of structure (I) is intended to encompass any and all acceptable salt forms.<br>
In addition, prodrugs are also included within the context of this invention. Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups. Thus, representative examples of<br><br>
prodrugs include (but are not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups of the compounds of structure (I). Further, in the case of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the like.<br>
With regard to stereoisomers, the compounds of structure (I) may have chiral centers and may occur as racemates, racemic mixtures and as individual enantiomers or diastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included within the present invention, including mixtures thereof. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms of the compounds of structure (I) may exist as polymorphs, which are included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of structure (I) may also form solvates with water or other organic solvents. Such solvates are similarly included within the scope of this invention.<br>
The effectiveness of a compound as a GnRH receptor antagonist may be determined by various assay techniques. Assay techniques well known in the field include the use of cultured pituitary cells for measuring GnRH activity (Vale et al., Endocrinology 91:562-512, 1972) and the measurement of radioligand binding to rat pituitary membranes (Perrin et al., Mol. Pliarmacol 23:44-51, 1983) or to membranes from cells expressing cloned receptors as described below. Other assay techniques include (but are not limited to) measurement of the effects of GnRH receptor antagonists on the inhibition of GnRH-stimulated calcium flux, modulation of phosphoinositol hydrolysis, and the circulating concentrations of gonadotropins in the castrate animal. Descriptions of these techniques, the synthesis of radiolabeled ligand, the employment of radiolabeled ligand in radioimmunoassay, and the measurement of the effectiveness of a compound as a GnRH receptor antagonist follow.<br>
Inhibition of GnRH stimulated LH release<br>
Suitable GnRH antagonists are capable of inhibiting the specific binding of GnRH to its receptor and antagonizing activities associated with GnRH. For example, inhibition of GnRH stimulated LH release in immature rats may be measured according to the method of Vilchez-Martinez (Endocrinology 96:1130-1134, 1975).<br><br>
Briefly, twenty-five day old male Spraque-Dawley rats are administered an GnRH antagonist in saline or other suitable formulation by oral gavage, subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection. This is followed by subcutaneous injection of 200 ng GnRH in 0.2 mL saline. Thirty minutes after the last injection, the animals are decapitated and trunk blood is collected. After centrifugation, the separated plasma is stored at -20 °C until determination of the concentrations of LH and/or FSH by radioimmunoassay (see below.)<br>
Rat Anterior Pituitary Cell Culture Assay of GnRH Antagonists<br>
Anterior pituitary glands are collected from 7-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats and the harvested glands are digested with collagenase in a dispersion flask for 1.5 hr at 37 °C. After collagenase digestion, the glands are further digested with neuraminidase for 9 min at 37 °C. The digested tissue is then washed with 0.1 % BSA/McCoy's 5A medium, and the washed cells are suspended in 3 % FBS/0.1 BSA/McCoy's 5A medium and plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a cell density of 40,000 cells per well in 200 ul medium. The cells are then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. For assay of an GnRH antagonist, the incubated cells are first washed with 0.1 % BSA/McCoy's 5A medium once, followed by addition of the test sample plus InM GnRH in 200 uJ 0.1 % BSA/McCoy's 5A medium in triplicate wells. Each sample is assayed at 5-dose levels to generate a dose-response curve for determination of the potency on the inhibition of GnRH stimulated LH and/or FSH release. After 4-hr incubation at 37 °C, the medium is harvested and the level of LH and/or FSH secreted into the medium is determined by RIA.<br>
Membrane Binding Assays 1<br>
Cells stably, or transiently, transfected with GnRH receptor expression vectors are harvested, resuspended in 5% sucrose and homogenized using a polytron homogenizer (2x15 sec). Nucleii are removed by centrifugation (3000 x g for 5 min.), and the supernatant is centrifuged (20,000 x g for 30 min, 4 °C) to collect the membrane fraction. The final membrane preparation is resuspended in binding buffer (lOmM<br><br>
Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% BSA) and stored at -70 °C. Binding reactions are performed in a Millipore Multiscreen 96-well filtration plate assembly with polyethylenimine coated GF/C membranes. The reaction is initiated by adding membranes (40 ug protein in 130 ul binding buffer) to 50 pi of [125I]-labeled GnRH peptide (~100,000 cpm) and 20 ul of competitor at varying concentrations. The reaction is terminated after 90 minutes by application of vacuum and washing (2X) with phosphate buffered saline. Bound radioactivity is measured using 96-well scintillation counting (Packard Topcount) or by removing the filters from the plate and direct gamma counting. Kj values are calculated from competition binding data using nonlinear least squares regression using the Prism software package (GraphPad Software).<br>
Membrane Binding Assays 2<br>
For additional membrane binding assays, stably transfected HEK293 cells are harvested by striking tissue culture flasks against a firm surface and collected by centrifogation at lOOOxg for 5 minutes. Cell pellets are resuspended in 5% sucrose and homogenized using a polytron homogenizer for two 15 second homogenization steps. Cell homogenates are then centrifuged for 5 minutes at SOOOxg to remove nuclei, and the supernatant is subsequently centrifuged for 30 minutes at 44,000xg to collect the membrane fraction. The membrane pellet is resuspended in GnRH binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1%BSA,) and aliquots are immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein content of the membrane suspension is determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).<br>
Competitive radioligand binding assays with membrane preparations are performed in Millipore 96-well filtration plates with GF/C membrane filters which are pre-coated with 200 ul of 0.1% polyethylenimine (Sigma, St. Louis. MO). Prior to use, the plates are washed 3X with phosphate buffered saline solution. Membrane fraction in GnRH binding buffer (130 ul containing 25 ug protein for human and macaque receptors or 12 ug for rat receptors) are added to wells together with 20 ul of competing ligand at varying concentrations. The binding reaction is initiated by addition of radioligand (O.lnM in 50 ul GnRH binding buffer.) The reaction is allowed to proceed<br><br>
for 90 min on a platform shaker at room temperature and then terminated by placing assay plate on a Millipore vacuum manifold (Millipore, Bedford, MA), aspirating the solvent, and washing wells twice with 200 ul ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Filters in the wells are removed and counted in a gamma counter. K,- values are calculated from each competition binding curves using non-linear least square regression and corrected for radioligand concentration using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) assuming a radioligand affinity of 0.5 nM. Mean K; values are calculated from the antilog of the mean of the pK,-values for each receptor ligand pair.<br>
Membrane Binding Assays 3<br>
Stably transfected human GNRH receptor RBL cells are grown to confluence. The medium is removed and the cell monolayer is washed once with DPBS. A solution of 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS (Ca^ Mg+* free) is added to the plate which is then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells are dislodged by gentle rapping of the flasks. The cells are collected and pelleted by centrifugation at 800g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet is then resuspended in buffer [DPBS (1.5 mM KH2PO4, S.lmM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCI, and 138 mM NaCl) supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, pH=7.4 with NaOH]. Cell lysis is then performed using a pressure cell and applying N2 at a pressure of 900psi for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and larger debris are removed by centrifugation at 1200g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell membrane supernatant is then centrifuged at 45,000g and the resulting membrane pellet is resuspended in assay buffer and homogenized on ice using a tissue homogenizer. Protein concentrations are determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The pellets are aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. Titration analysis using a range of protein concentrations determined the optimal protein concentration to be 15 ug per well final concentration.<br>
UniFilter GF/C filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Boston MA ) are pretreated with a solution of 0.5% polyethyleneimine in distilled water for 30 minutes. Filters are<br><br>
pre-rinsed with 200 ul per well of PBS, 1% BSA (Fraction V) and 0.01% Tween-20, pH = 7.4) using a cell harvester (UniFilter-96 Filtermate; Packard). Membranes are harvested by rapid vacuum filtration and washed 3 times with 250 ul of ice-cold buffer (PBS, 0.01% Tween-20, pH = 7.4). Plates are air dried, 50 ul scintillation fluid (Microscint 20; Packard) is added, and the plate is monitored for radioactivity using a TopCount NXT (Packard Instruments, IL).<br>
Binding experiments are performed in buffer containing lOmM HEPES, 150mM NaCl, and 0.1% BSA, pH=7.5. Membranes are incubated with 50 ul [125I] His5, D-Tyr6 GnRH (0.2nM final concentration) and 50 ul of small molecule competitors at concentrations ranging from 30 pM to 10 uM for a total volume in each well of 200 ul. Incubations are carried out for 2hrs at room temperature. The reaction is terminated by rapid filtration over GF/C filters as previously described. Curve fitting is performed using Excel Fit Software (IDBS, Emeryville, CA). The Ki values are calculated using the method of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973) using a Kd value of 0.7nM for the radioligand which was previously determined in saturation binding experiments.<br>
Ca** flux measurement<br>
To determine the inhibition of GnRH-stimulated calcium flux in cells expressing the human GnRH receptor, a 96-well plate is seeded with RBL cells stably transfected with the human GnRH receptor at a density of 50,000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. Cells are loaded for Ihr at 37 °C in the following medium: DMEM with 20 mM HEPES, 10%FBS, 2 uM Fluo-4, 0.02% pluronic acid and 2.5 mM probenecid. Cells are washed 4 times with wash buffer (Hanks balanced salt, 20 mM HEPES, 2. 5mM probenecid) after loading, leaving 150 ul in the well after the last wash. GnRH is diluted in 0.1% BSA containing FLIPR buffer (Hanks balanced salt, 20 mM HEPES) to a concentration of 20nM and dispensed into a 96-well plate (Low protein binding). Various concentrations of antagonists are prepared in 0.1% BSA/FLIPR buffer in a third 96-well plate. Measurement of fluorescence due to GnRH stimulated (50 ul of 20nM, or 4 nM final) Ca** flux is performed according to<br><br>
manufacturer's instructions on a FUPR system (Molecular Devices, FLIPR384 system, Sunnyvale, CA) following a 1-minute incubation with 50 jil of antagonist at varying concentrations.<br>
Fhosphoinositol hydrolysis assay<br>
The procedure is modified from published protocols (W.Zhou et al; JMolChem. 270(32), ppl8853-18857, 1995). Briefly, RBL cells stably transfected with human GnRH receptors are seeded in 24 well plates at a density of 200, 000 cell/well for 24 hrs. Cells are washed once with inositol-free medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS and then labeled with luCi/mL of [wyo-3H]-inositol. After 20-24 hrs, cells are washed with buffer (140 nM NaCl, 4 mM KC1, 20 mM Hepes, 8.3 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.1%BSA) and treated with native GnRH peptide in the same buffer with or without various concentrations of antagonist and 10 mM LiCl for 1 hour at 37 °C. Cells are extracted with 10 mM formic acid at 4 °C for 30min and loaded on a Dowex AG1-X8 column, washed and eluted with 1 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid. The eluate is counted in a scintillation counter. Data from PI hydrolysis assay are plotted using non-linear least square regression by the Prism program (Graphpad, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), from which dose ratio is also calculated. The Schild linear plot is generated from the dose-ratios obtained in four independent experiments by linear regression, and the X-intercept is used to determine the affinity of the antagonist.<br>
Castrate animal studies<br>
Studies of castrate animals provide a sensitive in vivo assay for the effects of GnRH antagonist (Andrology 25: 141-147, 1993). GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland mediate GnRH-stimulated LH release into the circulation. Castration results in elevated levels of circulating LH due to reduction of the negative feedback of gonadal steroids resulting in enhancement of GnRH stimulated LH release. Consequently, measurement of suppression of circulating LH levels in castrated macaques can be used as a sensitive in vivo measure of GnRH antagonism. Therefore,<br><br>
male macaques are surgically castrated and allowed to recover for four-weeks at which point elevated levels of LH are present. Animals are then administered the test compound as an oral or i.v. dose and serial blood samples taken for measurement of LH. LH concentrations in serum from these animals can be determined by immunoassay or bioassay techniques (Endocrinology 107: 902-907,1980).<br>
Preparation of GnRH Radioligand<br>
The GnRH analog is labeled by the chloramine-T method. To 10 fig of peptide in 20 ul of 0.5M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, is added 1 mCi of Na125I, followed by 22.5 fag chloramine-T in 15 ul 0.05M sodium phosphate buffer and the mixture is vortexed for 20 sec. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 60 ug sodium metabisulfite in 30 ul 0.05M sodium phosphate buffer and the free iodine is removed by passing the reaction mixture through a C-8 Sep-Pak cartridge (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). The peptide is eluted with a small volume of 80% acetonitrile/water. The recovered labeled peptide is further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C-l 8 analytical column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) on a Beckman 334 gradient HPLC system using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The purified radioactive peptide is stored in 0.1% BSA/20% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA at -80 °C and can be used for up to 4 weeks.<br>
RJA of LH and FSH<br>
For determination of the LH levels, each sample medium is assayed in duplicates and all dilutions are done with RIA buffer (0.01M sodium phosphate buffer/0.15M NaCl/1% BSA/0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5) and the assay kit is obtained from the Nation Hormone and Pituitary Program supported by NIDDK. To a 12x75 mm polyethylene test tube is added 100 ul of sample medium diluted 1:5 or rLH standard in RIA buffer and 100 ul of [125I]-labeled rLH (-30,000 cpm) plus 100 ul of rabbit anti-rLH antibody diluted 1:187,500 and 100 ul RIA buffer. The mixture is incubated at room temperature over-night. In the next day, 100 uJ of goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:20 and 100 ul of normal rabbit serum diluted 1:1000 are added and the mixture<br><br>
incubated for another 3 hr at room temperature. The incubated tubes are then centriraged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant removed by suction. The remaining pellet in the tubes is counted in a gamma-counter. R1A of FSH is done in a similar fashion as the assay for LH with substitution of the LH antibody by the FSH antibody diluted 1:30,000 and the labeled rLH by the labeled rFSH.<br>
Activity of GnRH receptor antagonists<br>
Activity of GnRH receptor antagonists are typically calculated from the ICso as the concentration of a compound necessary to displace 50% of the radiolabeled ligand from the GnRH receptor, and is reported as a "Kj" value calculated by the following equation:<br>
where L = radioligand and KD = affinity of radioligand for receptor (Cheng and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099, 1973). GnRH receptor antagonists of this invention have a K; of 100 uM or less. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the GnRH receptor antagonists have a Ki of less than 10 uM, and more preferably less than 1 uM, and even more preferably less than 0.1 uM (i.e., 100 nM). To this end, all compounds specifically disclosed in the Examples have Kj's of less than 100 nM in one or more of Membrane Binding Assays 1 through 3 above.<br>
The ability of the GnRH antagonists to inhibit the major drug metabolizing enzymes in the human liver, namely, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, can be evaluated in vitro according to a microtiter plate-based fluorimetric method described by Crespi et al. (Anal. Biochem. 248:188-190; 1997). AMMC (/.., 3-[2-(N,N-Diethyl-N-memylammonium)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin) and BFC (i.e., 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin) at a concentration equal to Km (that is, the concentration of substrate that produces one half of the maximal velocity) are used as marker substrates for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively. Briefly, recombinant CYP2D6 or CYP3 A4 is incubated with marker substrate and NADPH generating system (consisting of 1 mM NADP+, 46 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 3 units/mL glucose-6-phosphate<br><br>
dehydrogenase)at 37°C, in the absence or presence of 0.03, 0.09, 0.27, 0.82, 2.5, 7.4, 22, 67 and 200 uM of a sample GnRH antagonist. Reactions are stopped by the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile. The precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation and the clear supernatant fluid is analyzed using a microtiter plate fluorimeter. GnRH antagonists of the present invention preferably have Kj's greater than 250 nM, more preferably greater than 1 uM and most preferably greater than 5 uM.<br>
