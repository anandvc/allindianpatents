DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention is related to a process oil that is added to a natural rubber<br>
or a synthetic rubber to manufacture a rubber composition, manufacturing methods of a<br>
deasphalted oil and an extract as raw materials for manufacturing the process oil, and a<br>
manufacturing method of the process oil.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A process oil is typically added to a rubber material used for manufacturing a tire<br>
in order to enhance mechanical performances and processability of the rubber material.<br>
The process oil is used as: a constituent of a plasticizer for a thermoplastic resin; a<br>
constituent of a printing ink; and a lubricant or a solvent component used for a softener or<br>
the like for a recycled asphalt, as well as being used with rubber materials such as a<br>
natural rubber and a synthetic rubber.<br>
[0003]<br>
For a process oil used as an additive for the rubber materials, there has been<br>
conventionally employed an extract that is a by-product produced in manufacturing a<br>
paraffinic base oil by solvent refining. However, due to a carcinogenicity problem,<br>
noncarcinogenic aromatic oils for tires have been being manufactured by various<br>
manufacturing methods.<br>
[0004]<br>
In manufacturing a rubber for a tire, since compatibility of the process oil and the<br>
rubber material is regarded as important, an aromatic component of the process oil is an<br>
important factor. However, since excessive dependency on the aromatic component leads<br>
to increase of the carcinogenicity of the process oil, the aromatic oil as a source of the<br>
carcinogenicity has to be removed while maintaining the compatibility of the process oil<br>
and the rubber material in a proper state.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
Furthermore, a hazardous effect of polycyclic aromatics (PCA; same meaning as<br>
PAH (PolyAromatic Hydrocarbon)) contained in the process oil has been acknowledged<br>
as a problem in recent years. Especially, since the process oil used for an automobile tire<br>
pollutes me environment via dusts of die tire, there has been a demand for reducing the<br>
PCA contained in the process oil. In Europe or other areas, a mineral oil having a PCA<br>
content of 3 mass% or more is restricted in handling. However, since an extracted oil with<br>
high aromatics content obtained by conventional manufacturing methods contains high<br>
contents of the polycyclic aromatics, it has been urgendy required to develop a process oil<br>
with reduced PCA (specifically, less man 3 mass%) and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
[0006]<br>
With such background, there has been studied a technology for manufacturing a<br>
process oil wim reduced PCA content and capable of balancing the compatibility with a<br>
rubber material and non-carcinogenicity. For example, a technology related to a<br>
manufacturing method of a process oil for a tire rubber has been disclosed, in which a<br>
naphthenic asphaltene and a solvent-extracted oil are combined (see, for instance, Patent<br>
Document 1). As another technology, there has been disclosed a manufacturing method of<br>
a process oil using an extract obtained by solvent-extracting a deasphalted oil (see, for<br>
instance, Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3).<br>
[0007]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A-11-80434<br>
[Patent Document 2] JP-A-2000-80208<br>
[Patent Document 3] JP-A- 2002-3861<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
However, while the process oil obtained by me technology disclosed in the Patent<br><br>
Document 1 ensures safety, a rubber composition containing the process oil did not<br>
exhibit performances equal to rubber compositions containing conventional aromatic oils.<br>
In process oils obtained by the technologies disclosed in the Patent Documents 2 and 3,<br>
since the deasphalted oil of a paraffinic residual oil is used as it is, the pour point thereof<br>
is high, which undesirably causes a wax component to be separated out on a surface of a<br>
rubber in a rubber composition using the process oil.<br>
In addition, in the technologies disclosed in the Documents 2 and 3, the extract<br>
obtained by solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil is used in manufacturing the process<br>
oils. However, since the extract contains high content of an aromatic component, further<br>
processing such as extraction and hydrogenation are required to control the content of the<br>
aromatic component to be less than a regulation value, thus requiring many manufacturing<br>
steps.<br>
[0009]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process oil exhibiting<br>
performances equal to conventional aromatic oils while being noncarcinogenic and<br>
excellent in safety, as well as providing a simpler manufacturing method of the process oil.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide manufacturing methods of a<br>
deasphalted oil and an extract as raw materials that are favorably used in manufacturing<br>
the process oil.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0010]<br>
In order to solve the problem described above, a process oil according to a first<br>
aspect of the present invention uses as a raw material a deasphalted oil obtained by<br>
deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a crude oil, the process oil having properties of (a)<br>
to (f) below:<br>
(a)	a polycyclic aromatics (PC A) content of less than 3 mass%;<br>
(b)	a viscosity (100 °C) of 40 to 70 mm2/s;<br>
(c)	an aniline point of 85 to 100 °C;<br><br>
(d)	a flash point of 250 °C or higher;<br>
(e)	an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 40 to 55 mass%; and<br>
(f)	a polar substance content of 10 to 15 mass%.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, the process oil uses as the raw<br>
material the deasphalted oil obtained by deasphalting die vacuum residual oil of the crude<br>
oil. With the PCA content being less man 3 mass%, the process oil is noncarcinogenic and<br>
excellent in safety. In addition, with the properties of (b) to (f), the process oil can<br>
maintain performances equal to conventional aromatic oils, so mat a rubber composition<br>
made by adding the process oil to a natural rubber or a synthetic rubber will have<br>
preferable rubber properties, while being capable of preventing bleeding wiui the oil<br>
bleeding on a surface of a rubber and separation of a wax component.<br>
Here, the process oil of the present invention uses me deasphalted oil as the raw<br>
material, which may be: a deasphalted oil; any one of oil components made of a<br>
deasphalted oil as a raw material such as a dewaxed oil (a dewaxed deasphalted oil)<br>
obtained by dewaxing the deasphalted oil and an extract extracted from the dewaxed oil;<br>
and a mixture of two or more of the oil components above.<br>
[0012]<br>
The process oil of the present invention preferably has (g) pour point of 40 °C or<br>
lower. By setting the range of the pour point, the wax component is not separated out on<br>
the surface of a rubber to be manufactured, thus improving appearance and commercial<br>
value.<br>
[0013]<br>
The process oil according to the aspect of the present invention preferably shows<br>
an ASTM color phase of 8.0 or lower when being diluted with a toluene of sixty times as<br>
large volume as me process oil<br>
Since the process oil of the present invention contains small content of an<br>
asphaltene component, when used for manufacturing of a colored asphalt, the asphalt will<br>
be finished with a good color.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
By adjusting the process oil of the present invention to have (h) aniline point of<br>
85 to 95 °C, the PCA content becomes appropriate and the compatibility with a rubber<br>
material is improved, resulting in exhibiting the above described effects more effectively.<br>
[0015]<br>
A process oil according to a second aspect of the present invention is obtained by<br>
mixing: an extract obtained by deasphalting and solvent-extracting a vacuum residual oil<br>
of a crude oil; and a lubricant base oil having a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less<br>
than 3 mass%, the process oil having properties of: (a) and (i) to (n) below:<br>
(a) a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%;<br>
(i) a viscosity (100 °C) of 30 to 80 mm2/s;<br>
(j) an aniline point of 90 °C or lower;<br>
(k) a flash point of 240 °C or higher;<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less;<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(n) a polar substance content of 10 to 30 mass%.<br>
[0016]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, the process oil is obtained by<br>
mixing an extract obtained by deasphalting and solvent-extracting the vacuum residual oil<br>
of the crude oil and a predetermined lubricant base oil, and the PCA content is less than 3<br>
mass%, so that the process oil is noncarcinogenic and excellent in safety. In addition, with<br>
the properties of (i) to (n), the process oil can maintain performances equal to<br>
conventional aromatic oils, so that a rubber composition obtained by adding the process<br>
oil to a natural rubber or a synthetic rubber will have preferable rubber properties, while<br>
being capable of preventing bleeding with the oil bleeding on a surface of a rubber and<br>
separation of a wax component.<br>
[0017]<br>
By adjusting the process oil of the present invention to have (o) aniline point of<br>
60 to 90oC, the PCA content becomes appropriate and the compatibility with a rubber<br><br>
material is improved, resulting in exhibiting the above described effects more effectively.<br>
[0018]<br>
A manufacturing method of a process oil according to a third aspect of the<br>
present invention includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a<br>
crude oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting<br>
the deasphalted oil to obtain an extract with a yield of 50 mass% or higher of the<br>
deasphalted oil, the extract being provided as the process oil.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the manufacturing method<br>
includes the deasphalting step for obtaining the deasphalted oil from the vacuum residual<br>
oil of the crude oil and the solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the deasphalted<br>
oil to obtain the extract as the process oil, the process oil having the properties of (a) to (f)<br>
described above can be properly provided.<br>
In the solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil to obtain<br>
the extract, the extract is obtained with the yield of 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted<br>
oil and the extract is provided as the process oil, so that the process oil with the PCA<br>
content of less than 3 mass% can be securely obtained.<br>
[0020]<br>
A manufacturing method of a process oil according to a fourth aspect of the<br>
present invention includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a<br>
crude oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting<br>
the deasphalted oil to obtain an extract, in which the extract obtained in the<br>
solvent-extraction step and at least one member selected from the group consisting of the<br>
deasphalted oil obtained in the deasphalting step and a mineral oil having a polycyclic<br>
aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass% are mixed to obtain a mixed oil, the mixed<br>
oil being provided as the process oil.<br>
The mixed oil of the extract and the deasphalted oil obtained in the deasphalting<br>
step or the mineral oil with the polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%<br>
may be provided as the process oil. Even with the arrangement, the process oil having the<br><br>
properties of (a) to (f) can also be provided properly.<br>
In such case, it is not necessary to obtain the extract with the yield of 50 mass%<br>
or higher of the deasphalted oil in the solvent-extraction step for obtaining the extract<br>
from the deasphalted oil, but it is only necessary to mix the extract obtained with a desired<br>
yield and at least one member selected from the group consisting of the deasphalted oil<br>
obtained in the deasphalting step and the mineral oil with the PCA content of less than 3<br>
mass% in order to obtain the process oil. However, there is also no problem in employing<br>
the extract obtained with the yield of 50 mass% or higher of me deasphalted oil, of which<br>
the PCA content is expected to be low.<br>
[0021]<br>
A manufacturing method of a process oil according to a fifth aspect of the present<br>
invention includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a crude<br>
oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; a dewaxing step for dewaxing the deasphalted oil to obtain<br>
a dewaxed oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting me dewaxed oil to<br>
obtain an extract with a yield of 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil, me extract<br>
being provided as the process oil.<br>
[0022]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the manufacturing memod<br>
includes the deasphalting step for obtaining the deasphalted oil from the vacuum residual<br>
oil of the crude oil, the dewaxing step for obtaining the dewaxed oil from the deasphalted<br>
oil and the solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the dewaxed oil to obtain the<br>
extract as the process oil, the process oil having me properties of (a) to (f) described above<br>
can be properly provided.<br>
Especially, dewaxing the deasphalted oil can provide proper fluidity to the<br>
process oil, which accordingly facilitates handling of the oil, while preventing me wax<br>
component from being separated out on the surface of a rubber to be manufactured.<br>
In the solvent-extraction step for extracting the dewaxed oil to obtain the extract,<br>
the extract is obtained with a yield of 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil and the<br>
extract is provided as the process oil, so that the process oil with the PCA content of less<br><br>
and the deasphalted oil or the like is used as the process oils, the process oil having the<br>
properties of (a) to (f) can be obtained effectively, thus enhancing properties of the rubber<br>
composition.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the manufacturing method of the process oil according to the aspect of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that a yield of the deasphalted oil obtained in the<br>
deasphalting step is 30 mass% or higher of the vacuum residual oil, and a viscosity at<br>
100 °C of the deasphalted oil is 30 to 50 mm2/s.<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the yield of the<br>
deasphalted oil obtained in the deasphalting step is 30 mass% or higher of the vacuum<br>
residual oil in the manufacturing method of the process oil, the viscosity at 100 °C of the<br>
deasphalted oil can be adjusted to 30 mm2/s or higher and foaming in the deasphalting<br>
step can be prevented, thus achieving consistent production of the deasphalted oil.<br>
By adjusting the viscosity at 100 °C of the deasphalted oil to be 30 to 50 mm2/s,<br>
the viscosity at 100 °C of the resulting process oil can be easily adjusted to 40 to 70<br>
mm /s.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the manufacturing method of the process oil according to the aspect of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that a pour point of the dewaxed oil obtained in the<br>
dewaxing step is 0 to 25 °C, and a yield of the dewaxed oil is 90 mass% or higher of the<br>
deasphalted oil.<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the pour point of the<br>
dewaxed oil obtained in the dewaxing step is adjusted to be 0 to 25 °C in the<br>
manufacturing method of the process oil, the pour point of the resulting process oil can be<br>
easily adjusted to 40 °C or lower.<br>
Since the yield of the dewaxed oil is set to 90 mass% or higher of the deasphalted<br>
oil, when, for instance, a hydrodewaxing is employed in the dewaxing step, decrease in<br>
yield due to decomposition can be prevented, and when a solvent dewaxing is employed<br>
in the dewaxing step, generation of the wax component can be minimized, thereby<br><br>
preferably preventing decrease in production efficiency.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the manufacturing method of the process oil according to the aspect of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that an extraction temperature in the solvent-extraction<br>
step is 80 to 150oC, and a solvent ratio is 2.0 to 12.0.<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since specific ranges are set for<br>
the extraction temperature and the solvent ratio in the solvent-extraction step in the<br>
manufacturing step of the process oil, the extract with the PCA content of less than 3<br>
mass% can be obtained efficiently.<br>
[0028]<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, a manufacturing method<br>
of a deasphalted oil using as a raw material a vacuum residual oil of a crude oil includes<br>
deasphalting the vacuum residual oil using as a solvent a propane or a mixed solvent of a<br>
butane and a propane under conditions of: a solvent ratio of 4.5 to 6; a column top<br>
temperature of 85 to 100 °C; and a yield for the deasphalted oil of 30 to 40 vol%, the<br>
deasphalted oil having properties of (a), (1) and (m) below:<br>
(a) a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%;<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less.<br>
[0029]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the deasphalted oil with<br>
reduced content of the specified aromatic compound can be easily obtained, the superior<br>
extract can be easily manufactured from the deasphalted oil as a crude material, the extract<br>
being the raw material of the process oil having the properties of (a) and (i) to (n).<br>
[0030]<br>
According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, a manufacturing method<br>
of an extract using as a raw material a deasphalted oil obtained by deasphalting a vacuum<br>
residual oil of a crude oil includes: solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil under conditions<br>
of: an extraction temperature of 80 to 150 °C; and a solvent ratio of 2.0 to 15.0, the extract<br><br>
having properties of (1) and (m) below:<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less.<br>
[0031]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the extract with reduced<br>
content of the specified aromatic compound can be easily obtained, the process oil being<br>
excellent in safety with the properties of (a) and (i) to (n) can be easily manufactured from<br>
the extract as the raw material.<br>
[0032]<br>
According to an ninth aspect of the present invention, a manufacturing method of<br>
a process oil includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a<br>
crude oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting<br>
the deasphalted oil to obtain an extract; in which the extract obtained in the<br>
solvent-extraction step and a lubricant base oil having a polycyclic aromatics (PCA)<br>
content of less than 3 mass% are mixed to obtain a mixed oil, the mixed oil being<br>
provided as the process oil.<br>
With the manufacturing method of the process oil of the present invention, the<br>
process oil having the properties of (a) and (i) to (n) described above can be provided<br>
property.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the manufacturing method of the process oil according to the aspect of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that the lubricant base oil further has properties of (p) to<br>
(r), (1) and (m) below.<br>
(p) a viscosity (100 °C) of 5 to 40 mm2/s;<br>
(q) an aniline point of 75 to 120 °C;<br>
(r) a flash point of 200 °C or higher;<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less.<br>
[0034]<br><br>
With the lubricant base oil having such properties, it becomes even easier to<br>
obtain the process oil having the properties of (a) and (i) to (n) by mixing the extract and<br>
the lubricant base oil.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, in the manufacturing method of<br>
the process oil, a volume mixing ratio of the extract and the lubricant base oil is preferably<br>
set to 95/5 to 60/40.<br>
By setting the mixing volume ratio of the extract and the lubricant base oil to the<br>
range described above, it becomes even easier to obtain the process oil having the<br>
properties of (a) and (i) to (n).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0037]<br><first embodiment><br>
A process oil and a manufacturing method of the process oil according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br>
The process oil of the present embodiment uses as a raw material a deasphalted<br>
oil obtained by deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a crude oil, the process oil having<br>
properties of (a) to (f) below:<br>
(a)	a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%;<br>
(b)	a viscosity (100 °C) of 40 to 70 mm2/s;<br>
(c)	an aniline point of 85 to 100 °C;<br><br>
(d)	a flash point of 250 °C or higher;<br>
(e)	an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 40 to 55 mass%; and<br>
(f)	a polar substance content of 10 to 15 mass%.<br>
[0038]<br>
(a)	Content of Polycyclic Aromatics (PCA):<br>
The PCA content in the process oil of the present embodiment should be less than<br>
3 mass%, and preferably less than 2.5 mass%. Since a mineral oil having the PCA content<br>
of 3 mass% or more is restricted in handling in Europe or other areas due to its<br>
carcinogenicity, the PCA content in the process oil of the present embodiment is<br>
accordingly set to less than 3 mass%. By setting the PCA content to less than 3 mass%,<br>
the process oil being noncarcinogenic and excellent in safety can be provided.<br>
The PCA content in the process oil may be measured in compliance with IP346<br>
(92) standardized by The Institute of Petroleum.<br>
[0039]<br>
(b)	Viscosity (100 °C):<br>
The viscosity at 100 °C of the process oil of the present embodiment should be<br>
40 to 70 mm2/s, and preferably 40 to 55 mm2/s. When the viscosity is lower than 40<br>
mm2/s, normal state properties of a rubber to which the process oil is added will be<br>
degraded. When the viscosity exceeds 70 mm2/s, the viscosity is too high, which adversely<br>
affects molding-processability and operability in being added to the rubber as well as<br>
degrading rubber properties.<br>
Incidentally, the viscosity at 100 °C of the process oil may be measured in<br>
compliance with ASTM D445.<br>
[0040]<br>
(c)	Aniline Point:<br>
The aniline point of the process oil of the present embodiment should be 85 to<br>
100 °C, and preferably 85 to 95 °C (i.e., property (h)). When the aniline point is lower<br>
man 85 °C, the PCA content increases and possibly exceeds 3 mass% as a regulation value.<br>
On the other hand, when the aniline point exceeds 100 °C, compatibility wim the rubber<br><br>
material is degraded, which might generate bleeding.<br>
Aniline points of conventional process oils have been typically set to 80 °C or<br>
lower because the lower aniline point has been considered to less likely generate the<br>
bleeding in terms of the compatibility with the rubber material. However, by<br>
manufacturing the process oil by, for instance, mixing the extract obtained by<br>
solvent-extracting a dewaxed oil and a dewaxed oil by a desired mixing ratio to control (e)<br>
content of aromatic hydrocarbon and (f) content of polar substance to be in the range from<br>
40 to 55 mass% and 10 to 15 mass% respectively, the bleeding can be sufficiendy<br>
prevented even with the aniline point of 80 °C or higher.<br>
Incidentally, the aniline point of the process oil may be measured in compliance<br>
with ASTM D611.<br>
[0041]<br>
(d)	Flash Point:<br>
The flash point of the process oil of the present embodiment should be 250 °C or<br>
higher, and preferably 280 °C or higher. When the flash point is lower than 250 °C, the<br>
process oil is easy to vaporize, which causes a problem in safety and adversely affects the<br>
environment.<br>
Incidentally, the flash point of the process oil may be measured in compliance<br>
with ASTM D92.<br>
[0042]<br>
(e)	Content of Aromatic Hydrocarbon:<br>
The aromatic hydrocarbon content in the process oil of the present embodiment<br>
should be 40 to 55 mass%, and preferably 45 to 55 mass%. When the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon content is less than 40 mass%, the compatibility with the rubber material is<br>
degraded, which makes it difficult to add the process oil to manufacture a rubber, and<br>
adversely affect the properties of the rubber. On the other hand, when the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon content exceeds 55 mass%, the PCA content increases and possibly exceeds<br>
3 mass% as the regulation value.<br>
Incidentally, the aromatic hydrocarbon content in the process oil may be<br><br>
measured in compliance with ASTM D2007.<br>
[0043]<br>
(f)	Content of Polar Substance:<br>
The polar substance content in the process oil of the present embodiment should<br>
be 10 to 15 mass%, and preferably 12 to 15 mass%. When the polar substance content is<br>
less than 10 mass%, the compatibility with the rubber material is degraded. On the other<br>
hand, when the polar substance content exceeds 15 mass%, it adversely affects the<br>
properties of the rubber when added to the rubber, and further, the PCA content increases<br>
and possibly exceeds 3 mass% as the regulation value.<br>
Incidentally, the content of the polar substance of the process oil may be<br>
measured in compliance with ASTM D2007.<br>
[0044]<br>
(g)	Pour Point:<br>
The pour point of the process oil of the present embodiment is preferably 40 °C<br>
or lower, and more preferably 20 °C or lower. When the pour point is higher than 40 °C, a<br>
wax component is separated out on a surface of the rubber to be manufactured, which<br>
degrades the appearance and a commercial value of the rubber to be manufactured.<br>
Incidentally, the pour point of the process oil may be measured in compliance<br>
with ASTM D97.<br>
[0045]<br>
Note mat the process oil of the present embodiment preferably exhibits ASTM<br>
color phase of 8.0 or lower when being diluted by a toluene of 60 times as large volume as<br>
the process oil, and more preferably 6.0 or lower. By adjusting the ASTM color phase to<br>
be 8.0 or lower, content of an asphaltene component becomes small, and thus when used<br>
for manufacturing of a colored asphalt, the asphalt will be finished with a good color.<br>
[0046]<br>
Now, examples of a procedure to manufacture the process oil of the present<br>
embodiment will be described below.<br>
A first procedure of the manufacturing method of the process oil of the present<br><br>
embodiment includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a<br>
crude oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting<br>
the deasphalted oil to obtain an extract with a yield of 55 mass% or higher of the<br>
deasphalted oil to provide the extract oil as the process oil. With the procedure of the<br>
manufacturing method, the process oil having the properties of (a) to (f) described above<br>
can be obtained efficiently.<br>
[0047]<br>
Note that in the first procedure that includes the deasphalting step for<br>
deasphalting the vacuum residual oil of the crude oil to obtain the deasphalted oil and the<br>
solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil to obtain the extract, a<br>
mixed oil obtained by mixing the extract obtained in the solvent-extraction step and at<br>
least one member selected from the group consisting of the deasphalted oil obtained in the<br>
deasphalting step and a mineral oil with the polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less<br>
than 3 mass% may be provided as the process oil (first procedure-b). With such<br>
arrangement, the process oil having the properties of (a) to (f) described above can be<br>
properly provided.<br>
[0048]<br>
A second procedure of the manufacturing method of the process oil of the present<br>
embodiment includes: a deasphalting step for deasphalting a vacuum residual oil of a<br>
crude oil to obtain a deasphalted oil; a dewaxing step for dewaxing the deasphalted oil to<br>
obtain a dewaxed oil; and a solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the dewaxed oil<br>
to obtain an extract with a yield of 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil to provide<br>
the extract as the process oil. With the procedure of the manufacturing method also, the<br>
process oil having the properties of (a) to (f) described above can be obtained efficiently.<br>
Especially, as compared to the first procedure, dewaxing the deasphalted oil can<br>
provide proper fluidity to the process oil, which accordingly facilitates handling of the oil<br>
and prevents the wax component from being separated out on the surface of the rubber.<br>
[0049]<br>
Note that also in the second procedure that includes the deasphalting step for<br><br>
deasphalting the vacuum residual oil of the crude oil to obtain the deasphalted oil, the<br>
dewaxing step for dewaxing the deasphalted oil to obtain the dewaxed oil and the<br>
solvent-extraction step for solvent-extracting the dewaxed oil to obtain the extract, a<br>
mixed oil obtained by mixing the extract obtained in the solvent-extraction step and at<br>
least one member selected from the group consisting of the deasphalted oil obtained in the<br>
deasphalting step or the dewaxed oil obtained in the dewaxing step and a mineral oil with<br>
the polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass% may be provided as the<br>
process oil (second procedure-b). With such arrangement, the process oil having the<br>
properties of (a) to (f) described above can be properly provided.<br>
[0050]<br>
Now, (I) deasphalting step and (III) solvent-extraction step included in the first<br>
procedure and (II) dewaxing step included in the second procedure between the steps (I)<br>
and (III) will be described in detail below.<br>
[0051]<br>
(I) Deasphalting Step:<br>
In the deasphalting step, the vacuum residual oil, which has been obtained by<br>
performing atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation on the crude oil, is<br>
deasphalted to obtain the deasphalted oil.<br>
Here, in order to perform the atmospheric distillation on the crude oil, a<br>
conventional atmospheric distillation device and a conventional distillation condition can<br>
be used. Specifically, for instance, the crude oil such as a paraffinic crude oil or a<br>
naphthenic crude oil, which is an object to be refined, is heated to about 350 °C in a<br>
heating furnace or the like and sent out to an atmospheric distillation column, which is<br>
then turned to be a petroleum vapor in the atmospheric distillation column. After cooling,<br>
the petroleum vapor is sequentially fractionated into fractions in the ascending order of<br>
boiling points. Since the vacuum residual oil is obtained by the atmospheric distillation<br>
and the vacuum distillation in the present embodiment, it may be so arranged to obtain an<br>
atmospheric residual oil having boiling point of 350 °C or higher.<br>
[0052]<br><br>
Next, further distillation (vacuum distillation) under reduced pressure is<br>
performed on the obtained atmospheric residual oil. The vacuum distillation may be<br>
performed using a conventional vacuum distillation device and a conventional operating<br>
condition, and the vacuum distillation fractionates the atmospheric residual oil into<br>
fractions such as a vacuum naphtha, a vacuum light gas oil and a vacuum residual oil,<br>
from which the vacuum residual oil is obtained.<br>
[0053]<br>
Then, the vacuum residual oil is separated into an oil component (deasphalted oil)<br>
and an asphalt component using a solvent such as a liquefied propane. Deasphalting using<br>
the liquefied propane is performed by, for instance, adding the liquefied propane to the<br>
vacuum residual oil by an amount of 4 to 8 times as large volume as that of the vacuum<br>
residual oil, while setting temperature to 40-80 °C in order to extract the deasphalted oil.<br>
[0054]<br>
Here, the yield of the obtained deasphalted oil in the deasphalting step is<br>
preferably 30 mass% or higher of the vacuum residual oil, more preferably, 35 mass% or<br>
higher. With the yield of the obtained deasphalted oil being 30 mass% or higher of the<br>
vacuum residual oil, the viscosity at 100°C of the deasphalted oil can be adjusted to 30<br>
mm /s or higher and foaming in the deasphalting step can be prevented, thus achieving<br>
consistent production of the deasphalted oil.<br>
By adjusting the viscosity at 100 °C of the deasphalted oil to be 30 to 50 mm2/s,<br>
the viscosity at 100 °C of the resulting process oil can be easily adjusted to 40 to 70<br>
mm2/s.<br>
[0055]<br>
The viscosity at 100 °C of the obtained deasphalted oil is preferably 30 to 50<br>
mm /s, and more preferably 35 to 45 mm2/s. By adjusting the viscosity at 100 °C of the<br>
deasphalted oil to 30 to 50 mm2/s, the viscosity at 100 °C of the resulting process oil to be<br>
obtained can be easily adjusted to 40 to 70 mm2/s.<br>
[0056]<br>
(II) Dewaxing Step:<br><br>
In the dewaxing step required in the second procedure, a paraffin wax component<br>
of the above-described deasphalted oil is separated to obtain the dewaxed oil. Performing<br>
the dewaxing step gives proper fluidity to the resulting process oil, which allows handling<br>
thereof to be facilitated and prevents the wax component from being separated out on the<br>
surface of the rubber to be manufactured.<br>
[0057]<br>
In the dewaxing step, the dewaxing should preferably be performed so that the<br>
pour point of the obtained dewaxed oil is 0 to 25 °C, and more preferably 10 to 20 °C. By<br>
adjusting the pour point of the dewaxed oil to 0 to 25 °C, particularly 10 to 20 °C, the pour<br>
point of the resulting process oil to be manufactured can be easily adjusted to 40 °C or<br>
lower.<br>
[0058]<br>
Examples of dewaxing method for dewaxing the deasphalted oil so mat the<br>
dewaxed oil to be obtained has the pour point of the above-described range may include<br>
hydrodewaxing and solvent dewaxing.<br>
As the hydrodewaxing, for instance, dewaxing using ZSM-5 catalyst (Exxon<br>
Mobil Corporation) is preferably performed.<br>
[0059]<br>
The hydrodewaxing is preferably performed under the following conditions:<br>
pressure = 1 to 16 mPa; LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) = 0.1 to 5.0/hour; and<br>
hydrogen/oil ratio = 100 to 800 Nm3/kL so that the pour point of the dewaxed oil to be<br>
obtained is within the range of 0 to 25 °C.<br>
[0060]<br>
Examples of solvents used in the solvent dewaxing may include, a methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, a toluene, a benzene and the like, and a mixed solvent thereof, particularly a<br>
mixed solvent of the methyl ethyl ketone and the toluene, may be preferable for use.<br>
When using the mixed solvent of the methyl ethyl ketone and the toluene, mixing ratio<br>
thereof may be around 40/60 to 60/40. In the solvent dewaxing, the solvent as described<br>
above is added to the deasphalted oil, which is then cooled. Then, precipitated wax crystal<br><br>
is filtered and separated.<br>
[0061]<br>
The yield of the dewaxed oil is preferably 90 mass% or higher of the deasphalted<br>
oil, and more preferably 95 mass% or higher. With the yield of the dewaxed oil being 90<br>
mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil, when, for instance, hydrodewaxing is employed as<br>
the dewaxing method, decrease in the yield due to decomposition can be prevented, and<br>
when solvent dewaxing is employed as the dewaxing method, generation of the wax<br>
component can be saved to be small, thereby preferably preventing decrease in production<br>
efficiency from decreasing.<br>
[0062]<br>
(HI) Solvent Extraction Step:<br>
In the solvent-extraction step, the deasphalted oil obtained in the above-described<br>
deasphalting step (in the first procedure) or the dewaxed oil obtained in the<br>
above-described dewaxing step (in the second procedure) is solvent-extracted using a<br>
polar solvent to obtain the extract. By solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil or the<br>
dewaxed oil to obtain the extract, the PCA content of the process oil can be easily<br>
maintained to be less than 3 mass%, and the aniline point can be appropriately adjusted,<br>
thereby preventing generation of the bleeding.<br>
[0063]<br>
Here, examples of available polar solvents may include a furfural, a<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), a phenol, a cresol, a sulfolane, a dimethylsulfoxide, a<br>
formylmorpholine and the like, especially the furfural and me N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
(NMP) may be preferable for use.<br>
[0064]<br>
In the solvent-extraction step, the solvent ratio (volume ratio of solvent/dewaxed<br>
oil or deasphalted oil) is preferably 2.0 to 12.0, and more preferably 5.0 to 10.0. In this<br>
case, the extraction temperature is preferably 80 to 150 °C, and more preferably 90 to<br>
130 °C. By performing the solvent-extraction under the conditions above, me extract with<br>
the PCA content of less man 3 mass% can be efficiently obtained.<br><br>
[0065]<br>
The yield of the extract obtained in the solvent-extraction step should be 50<br>
mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil, and preferably 60 mass% or higher. As long as the<br>
yield of the extract is 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil, the process oil with the<br>
PCA content of less than 3 mass% can be properly obtained.<br>
Incidentally, in order to obtain the extract with the yield of 50 mass% or higher of<br>
the deasphalted oil, for instance, when the furfural is used as the solvent, the solvent ratio<br>
may be around 10 to 12 and the extraction temperature may be around 120 to 150°C,<br>
whereas, when the NMP is used as the solvent, the solvent ratio may be around 5 to 8 and<br>
the extraction temperature may be around 100 to 120 °C.<br>
[0066]<br>
Meanwhile, as in the first procedure-b and the second procedure-b, when the<br>
mixed oil obtained by mixing the extract from the deasphalted oil (or the dewaxed oil)<br>
with at least one member selected from the group consisting of the deasphalted oil (or the<br>
dewaxed oil) and the mineral oil having the PCA content of less man 3 mass% is provided<br>
as the process oil, the yield of the extract in the solvent-extraction step for obtaining the<br>
extract from the deasphalted oil (or the dewaxed oil) is not necessarily to be 50 mass% or<br>
higher of the deasphalted oil. It is only necessary to mix the extract obtained with a<br>
desired yield with at least one member selected from the group consisting of the<br>
deasphalted oil obtained by the deasphalting step (or the dewaxed oil obtained in the<br>
dewaxing step) and the mineral oil having the PCA content of less than 3 mass%. With the<br>
arrangement, when the yield of the used extract is lower than 50 mass% or higher of the<br>
deasphalted oil, the PCA content of the extract can be 3 mass% or more, but by mixing<br>
this extract with the mineral oil or the deasphalted oil (or the dewaxed oil), the PCA<br>
content can be controlled to be less than 3 mass%, so that requirements of the properties<br>
of (b) to (f) described above can be achieved.<br>
Incidentally, there is no problem in using the extract obtained with the yield of 50<br>
mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil, of which the PCA content is expected to be small.<br>
[0067]<br><br><br>
Here, the obtained extract can be used as it is as the process oil with 100 mass%<br>
content of the extract.<br>
On the other hand, the mixed oil obtained by mixing the extract and at least one<br>
member selected from the group consisting of the deasphalted oil obtained in the<br>
deasphalting step and the mineral oil with the polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less<br>
than 3 mass% may be provided as the process oil in the first procedure, while the mixed<br>
oil obtained by mixing the extract and at least one member selected from the group<br>
consisting of the dewaxed oil obtained in the dewaxing step and the mineral oil with the<br>
polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass% may be provided as the process<br>
oil in the second procedure. As described above, when the mixed oil is provided as the<br>
process oil, the extract content is preferably in the range from 40 mass% to below 100<br>
mass%, and more preferably in the range from 50 mass% to below 100 mass%. While the<br>
process oil consisting of 100 mass% of the extract can properly achieve the properties of<br>
(a) to (f) described above, the process oil consisting of the mixed oil of the extract and the<br>
deasphalted oil and me like, in which the extract content is in the range from 40 mass% to<br>
below 100 mass%, can also properly achieve the properties of (a) to (f) described above.<br>
[0068]<br>
Now, the first procedure of the manufacturing method of the process oil of the<br>
present embodiment will be described referring to the flowchart in Fig. 1. First, the<br>
atmospheric distillation is performed on the crude oil to obtain the atmospheric residual<br>
oil and the vacuum distillation is performed on the atmospheric residual oil to obtain the<br>
vacuum residual oil (S1, S21, S22 and S2). Then, the obtained vacuum residual oil is<br>
deasphalted in the deasphalting step to obtain the deasphalted oil (S31, S3). The obtained<br>
deasphalted oil is men solvent-extracted in the solvent-extraction step to obtain the extract<br>
(S51, S5).<br>
Here, when the extract is not mixed with the deasphalted oil and/or the mineral<br>
oil with me polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%, me extract obtained<br>
with the yield of 50 mass% or higher of the deasphalted oil should be employed.<br>
[0069]<br><br>
rubber component.<br>
[0076]<br><second embodiment><br>
A process oil and a manufacturing method of the process oil according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br>
The process oil of the present embodiment is obtained by mixing: an extract<br>
solvent-extracted from a deasphalted oil that has been obtained by deasphalting a vacuum<br>
residual oil of a crude oil; and a lubricant base oil with a polycyclic aromatics (PCA)<br>
content of less than 3 mass%, the process oil having properties of (a) and (i) to (n) below:<br>
(a) a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less than 3 mass%;<br>
(i) a viscosity (100 °C) of 30 to 80 mm2/s;<br>
(j) an aniline point of 90 °C or lower;<br>
(k) a flash point of 240 °C or higher;<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less;<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(n) a polar substance content of 10 to 30 mass%.<br>
[0077]<br>
(a) Content of Polycyclic Aromatics (PCA):<br>
The PCA content in the process oil of the present embodiment should be less than<br>
3 mass%, and preferably less than 2.5 mass%. Since a mineral oil with the PCA content of<br>
3 mass% or more is restricted in handling in Europe or other areas due to its<br>
carcinogenicity, the PCA content in the process oil of the present embodiment is<br>
accordingly set to less than 3 mass%. By setting the PCA content to less than 3 mass%,<br>
the process oil being noncarcinogenic and excellent in safety can be provided.<br>
The PCA content in the process oil may be measured in compliance with IP346<br>
(92) standardized by The Institute of Petroleum.<br>
[0078]<br>
(i) Viscosity (100 °C):<br>
The viscosity at 100 °C of the process oil of the present embodiment should be<br><br>
30 to 80 mm2/s, and preferably 40 to 60 mm2/s. When the viscosity is lower than 30<br>
mm2/s, normal state properties of a rubber to which the process oil is added will be<br>
degraded. When the viscosity exceeds 80 mm2/s, the viscosity is too high, which adversely<br>
affects molding-processability and operability in being added to the rubber as well as<br>
degrading rubber properties.<br>
Incidentally, the viscosity at 100 °C of the process oil may be measured in<br>
compliance with ASTM D445.<br>
[0079]<br>
(j) Aniline Point:<br>
The aniline point of the process oil of the present embodiment should be 90 °C or<br>
lower, and preferably 60 to 90 °C (i.e., property (o)). When the aniline point exceeds<br>
90 °C, compatibility of the process oil and the rubber material is degraded, which might<br>
cause the process oil to bleed on the surface of the rubber. Although lower limit of the<br>
aniline point is not particularly specified, when the aniline point is lower than 60 °C, the<br>
PCA content increases and possibly exceeds 3 mass% as a regulation value. The aniline<br>
point of the process oil may be measured in compliance with ASTM D611.<br>
[0080]<br>
(k) Flash Point:<br>
The flash point of the process oil of the present embodiment should be 240 °C or<br>
higher, and preferably 260 °C or higher. When the flash point is lower than 240 °C, the<br>
process oil is easy to vaporize, which causes a problem in safety and adversely affects the<br>
environment.<br>
Incidentally, the flash point of the process oil may be measured in compliance<br>
with ASTM D92.<br>
[0081]<br>
(1) Content of Benzo(a)pyrene:<br>
The content of the benzo(a)pyrene in the process oil of the present embodiment is<br>
1 mass ppm or less.<br>
Although the benzo(a)pyrene is a carcinogenic substance, since the contents<br><br>
thereof is set to 1 mass ppm or less, there is no need to concern about its carcinogenicity,<br>
thereby providing the process oil that is excellent in safety.<br>
[0082]<br>
(m) Content of Specified Aromatic Compound (Total Concentration)<br>
The content of the specified aromatic compound (total concentration) in the<br>
process oil of the present embodiment is 10 mass ppm or less. Here, the specified aromatic<br>
compound refers to the following eight types of substances: a benzo(a)anthracene; a<br>
chrysene and a triphenylene; a benzo(b)fluoranthene; a benzo(k)fluoranthene; a<br>
benzo(j)fluoranthene; a benzo(e)pyrene; a benzo(a)pyrene; and a dibenzo(a,h)anthracene.<br>
Although any of the above specified aromatic compounds is highly carcinogenic<br>
substance, since the content (total concentration) thereof is set to be 10 mass ppm or less,<br>
there is no need to concern about its carcinogenicity, thereby providing the process oil that<br>
is excellent in safety. Incidentally, the concentration was measured by the following<br>
method.<br>
[0083]<br>
(Measuring Method of Concentration of Specified Aromatic Compound)<br>
1 g of a sample is dissolved into a hexane in a 50 ml flask to prepare a sample<br>
solution of 2 mass%. 1 ml of the sample solution is added to 5 g of a hydrous silica gel of<br>
5 mass%, which is rinsed with 20 ml of a hexane. Then, an object substance having<br>
adsorbed is eluted using 50 ml of a hexane solution containing 5 vol% of an acetone. After<br>
concentrating the eluate to 1 ml, 1 (ig of a chrysene d12 or a benzo(a)pyrene d12 is added as<br>
an internal standard material, which is then analyzed by a gaschromatograph.<br>
[0084]<br>
(n) Content of Polar Substance:<br>
The polar substance content in the process oil of the present embodiment should<br>
be 10 to 30 mass%, preferably 12 to 20 mass%, and more preferably 12 to 15 mass%.<br>
When the polar substance content is less than 10 mass%, the compatibility with the rubber<br>
material is degraded. On the other hand, when the polar substance content exceeds 30<br>
mass%, the PCA content increases and possibly exceeds 3 mass% as the regulation value,<br><br>
Then, the vacuum residual oil is separated into an oil component (deasphalted oil)<br>
and an asphalt component using a solvent such as a liquefied propane (or a mixed solvent<br>
of the liquefied propane and a butane). Deasphalting using the liquefied propane is<br>
performed by, for instance, adding the liquefied propane to the vacuum residual oil by an<br>
amount of 4.5 to 6 times as large volume as that of the vacuum residual oil and setting<br>
extraction temperature to 85 to 100 °C (column top)/60 to 75 °C (column bottom ) to<br>
extract the deasphalted oil.<br>
[0089]<br>
Here, the yield of the deasphalted oil obtained in the deasphalting step is 30 to 40<br>
vol% of the vacuum residual oil. The viscosity at 100 °C of the obtained deasphalted oil is<br>
preferably 30 to 50 mm2/s, and more preferably 30 to 45 mm2/s.<br>
[0090]<br>
By the above-described step, the deasphalted oil having the properties of (a), (1)<br>
and (m) below can be manufactured:<br>
(a) a polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of less man 3 mass%;<br>
(1) a benzo(a)pyrene content of 1 mass ppm or less; and<br>
(m) a specified aromatic compound content of 10 mass ppm or less.<br>
[0091]<br>
[Manufacturing of Extract (Solvent-Extraction Step)]<br>
In the solvent-extraction step, the deasphalted oil obtained in the above-described<br>
deasphalting step is solvent-extracted using the polar solvent to obtain the extract. By<br>
solvent-extracting the deasphalted oil to obtain the extract, the PCA content of the process<br>
oil can be easily maintained to be less than 3 mass%, and the aniline point can be<br>
appropriately adjusted, which results in preventing generation of the bleeding.<br>
[0092]<br>
Here, examples of available polar solvents may include a furfural, a<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), a phenol, a cresol, a sulfolane, a dimethylsulfoxide, a<br>
formylmorpholine and the like, especially the furfural and the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
(NMP) may be preferable for use.<br><br>
Since the process oil obtained in the second embodiment described above has the<br>
properties of (a) and (i) to (n), the process oil exhibits various performances that the<br>
conventional process oil has required, such as processability and anti-bleeding<br>
performance of the rubber. In addition, since the content of the PCA that is hazardous to<br>
human bothes is controlled to be less than 3 mass% and the contents of the<br>
benzo(a)pyrene and the specified aromatic compound are respectively controlled to be 1<br>
mass ppm or less and 10 mass ppm or less, the process oil is not carcinogenic and thus<br>
excellent in safety.<br>
[0100]<br>
In manufacturing conventional oils substituting the aromatic oil for tires, since<br>
two-stage extraction or facility (step) for further performing hydrotreatment on the extract<br>
has been required in order to obtain such process oil, yield decreased in each treatment. In<br>
contrast, the present embodiment requires only a simple method for mixing the extract and<br>
the lubricant base oil, which is further superior manufacturing method of the process oil as<br>
compared to the conventional method.<br>
[0101]<br>
Addition of the process oil to the natural rubber or the synthetic rubber can<br>
properly provide various types of rubber compositions, and the obtained rubber<br>
compositions can be used for various rubber products such as tires.<br>
Further, the process oil can also be used as a plasticizer for the thermoplastic<br>
resin, a constituent of a printing ink and a softener for a modified asphalt used in paving.<br>
[0102]<br>
When a rubber (rubber composition) is manufactured using the process oil of the<br>
present embodiment, content of the process oil may be, for instance, 10 to 50 parts by<br>
weight, and preferably 20 to 40 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of a rubber<br>
component.<br>
Also, in order to manufacture the rubber composition, reinforcers such as a<br>
carbon black and a silica, a vulcanizing agent, a vulcanization accelerator, a filler, an<br>
antioxidant such as waxes, a softener other than the process oil of the present<br><br>
embodiment, a plasticizer, etc., which are generally used in rubber industry, may<br>
appropriately be added in addition to the process oil of the embodiment and the rubber<br>
component.<br>
[0103]<br>
[Modification of Embodiments]<br>
Incidentally, the embodiment described above is only an embodiment illustrating<br>
the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to the embodiment but<br>

of (a) and (i) to (n) in the second embodiment.<br>

[0104]<br>
Now, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described in more<br>
detail with examples and comparisons, the description of which by no means limits the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0105]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
(Deasphalting Step)<br>
A vacuum residual oil obtained by performing the atmospheric distillation on a<br>
middle-east crude oil and further performing the vacuum distillation is deasphalted using a<br><br>
propane as a solvent to obtain a deasphalted oil A. Yield of the deasphalted oil A was 38<br>
mass% of the vacuum residual oil, and the viscosity at 100 °C of the deasphalted oil A<br>
was 37.6 mm2/s.<br>
[0106]<br>
(Dewaxing Step)<br>
The deasphalted oil A was solvent-dewaxed using a mixed solvent of a methyl<br>
ethyl ketone and a toluene (mixing ratio: methyl ethyl ketone/toluene = 40/60) to obtain a<br>
dewaxed oil A having pour point of 12.5 °C. Yield of the dewaxed oil A was 93 mass% of<br>
the deasphalted oil.<br>
[0107]<br>
(Solvent-Extraction Step)<br>
Then, the dewaxed oil A was solvent-extracted using a furfural as a solvent to<br>
obtain an extract A with a yield of 62 mass% of the deasphalted oil. Here, solvent ratio<br>
was 10 and extraction temperature was 145 °C. The extract A was provided as a process<br>
oil of Example 1 of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0108]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
(Deasphalting Step)<br>
As in Example 1, the vacuum residual oil obtained by performing the<br>
atmospheric distillation on the middle-east crude oil and further performing the vacuum<br>
distillation is deasphalted using the propane as a solvent to obtain the deasphalted oil A.<br>
[0109]<br>
(Dewaxing Step)<br>
The deasphalted oil A was dewaxed using Ni-ZSM5 catalyst under the<br>
following conditions: pressure = 3MPa; LHSV = 0.5/hour; hydrogen/oil ratio = 450 Nm3;<br>
and dewaxing temperature = 335 °C so that a dewaxed oil B having pour point of 20.0°C<br>
was obtained. Yield of the dewaxed oil B was 94 mass% of the deasphalted oil.<br>
[0110]<br>
(Solvent-Extraction Step)<br><br>
Then, the dewaxed oil B was solvent-extracted using a N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
(NMP) as a solvent to obtain an extract B with a yield of 64 mass% of the deasphalted oil.<br>
Here, the solvent ratio was 7 and the extraction temperature was 110 °C. The extract B<br>
was provided as a process oil of Example 2 of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0111]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
The dewaxed oil B obtained in Example 2 was solvent-extracted using the NMP<br>
as a solvent to obtain an extract D with a yield of 48 mass% of the deasphalted oil. Here,<br>
solvent ratio was 5 and extraction temperature was 95 oC. The extract D and the dewaxed<br>
oil B obtained in Example 2 were mixed with mixing ratio of extract D/dewaxed oil B =<br>
50/50 to obtain a process oil of Example 3 of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0112]<br>
[Example 4]<br>
The dewaxed oil B obtained in Example 2 was solvent-extracted using the NMP<br>
as a solvent to obtain the extract D with a yield of 48 mass% of the deasphalted oil. Here,<br>
the solvent ratio was 5 and the extraction temperature was 95oC. The extract D and a<br>
commercially-available mineral oil X with the polycyclic aromatics (PCA) content of 1.8<br>
mass% were mixed with mixing ratio of extract D/mineral oil X = 50/50 to obtain a<br>
process oil of Example 4 of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0113]<br>
[Example 5]<br>
The deasphalted oil A obtained in Example 1 was solvent-extracted using the<br>
furfural as a solvent to obtain an extract X with a yield of 53% of the deasphalted oil. Here,<br>
the solvent ratio was 5 and the extraction temperature was 125 °C. The extract X was<br>
provided as a process oil of Example 5 of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0114]<br>
[Example 6]<br><br>
An extract E obtained in later-described Comparison 6 and the deasphalted oil A<br>
obtained in Example 1 (which is also a process oil of later-described Comparison 3) were<br>
mixed with mixing ratio of extract E/deasphalted oil A = 50/50 to obtain a process oil of<br>
Example 6 of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0115]<br>
[Comparison 1]<br>
The dewaxed oil A obtained in Example 1 was solvent-extracted using the<br>
furfural as a solvent to obtain an extract C with a yield of 49 mass% of the deasphalted oil.<br>
Here, the solvent ratio was 8 and the extraction temperature was 110 °C. The extract C<br>
was provided as a process oil of Comparison 1.<br>
[0116]<br>
[Comparison 2]<br>
As in Example 3, the dewaxed oil B obtained in Example 2 was solvent-extracted<br>
using the NMP as a solvent to obtain the extract D with a yield of 48 mass% of the<br>
deasphalted oil. Here, the solvent ratio was 5 and the extraction temperature was 95 °C.<br>
The extract D was provided as a process oil of Comparison 2.<br>
[0117]<br>
[Comparison 3]<br>
The deasphalted oil A of Example 1 was provided as a process oil of Comparison<br>
3.<br>
[0118]<br>
[Comparison 4]<br>
The dewaxed oil A of Example 1 was provided as a process oil of Comparison 4.<br>
[0119]<br>
[Comparison 5]<br>
The dewaxed oil B of Example 2 was provided as a process oil of Comparison 5.<br>
[0120]<br>
[Comparison 6]<br>
The deasphalted oil A obtained in Example 1 was solvent-extracted using the<br><br>
furfural as a solvent to obtain the extract E with a yield of 40% of the deasphalted oil.<br>
Here, the solvent ratio was 5 and the extraction temperature was 125 °C. The extract E<br>
was provided as a process oil of Comparison 6.<br>
[0121]<br>
Properties of the process oils of Examples 1 to 6 are shown in Tables 1 and 2<br>
with properties of a conventional aromatic oil as reference. Also, properties of the process<br>
oils of Comparisons 1 to 6 are shown in Tables 3 and 4 with the properties of the<br>
conventional aromatic oil as reference. Here, standards or the like for evaluation are in<br>
compliance with those described above.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0127]<br>
For the obtained high styrene rubbers, generation of bleeding (a phenomenon in<br>
which an oil bleeds on a surface of a rubber) and separation of a wax component were<br>
visually observed. For the obtained general-purpose styrene rubbers, rubber properties<br>
such as elongation, hardness, tensile strength and M 300 (elasticity of a rubber when the<br>
rubber is elongated at elongation percentage of 300%) were measured in compliance with<br>
JIS K6301. Based on the visual observation and measurement, the high styrene rubbers<br>
and general-purpose rubbers were compared and evaluated. The results are shown in<br>
Tables 7 and 8.<br>
Note mat measurement values of the rubber properties of the general-purpose<br>
styrene rubbers were compared with those of a general-purpose styrene rubber<br>
manufactured using the conventional aromatic oil as the reference (refer to Tables 1 and 3<br>
for its properties). The evaluations were made using relative values with the measurement<br>
values of the aromatic oil being 100.<br>
[0128]<br>
(Result)<br><br><br><br><br>
[0129]<br>
As is clear from results in table 7, the high styrene rubbers using the process oils<br>
of Examples 1 to 6 were free from generation of the bleeding and separation of the wax<br>
component, so that they were verified to be high styrene rubbers having no problem in<br>
use.<br>
Especially, in Examples 4 and 6, even though the yields of the extracts used were<br>
less than 50 mass% of the deasphalted oils, the process oils having the properties of (b) to<br>
(f) could be made by mixing the extracts with the mineral oils or the asphalted oils by the<br>
mixing ratio of 50/50, and the evaluation results also showed no problem.<br>
In addition, the rubber properties of the general-purpose styrene rubbers using the<br>
process oils of Examples 1 to 6 did not show a big difference from that using the<br>
conventional aromatic process oil, so that they were verified to have rubber properties<br>
egual to those of conventional process oils.<br>
[0130]<br>
On the other hand, as is clear from the results in Table 8, since the process oil of<br>
Comparison 3 had high aniline point and pour point, bleeding and separation of the wax<br>
component were observed.<br><br>
Since the process oils of Comparisons 4 and 5 had high aniline point, bleeding<br>
was observed.<br>
[0131]<br>
As for the process oils of Comparisons 1, 2 and 6, the high styrene rubbers<br>
thereof showed no bleeding and separation of the wax component, and the<br>
general-purpose styrene rubbers thereof showed no problem in their rubber properties.<br>
However, since yields of the extracts in manufacturing were low, the contents of the<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons and the polar substances in the process oils became large, which<br>
caused the PCA content to exceed 3 mass%, so that the process oils had problems in<br>
carcinogenicity and safety.<br>
[0132]<br>
Next, me second embodiment of the present invention will be described in more<br>
detail with examples and comparisons, the description of which by no means limits the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0133]<br>
[Example 7]<br>
(Deasphalting Step)<br>
By performing the atmospheric distillation on a middle-east crude oil to extract a<br>
fuel oil such as a kerosene and a light gas oil and further performing the vacuum<br>
distillation on an atmospheric residual oil outlet from a distillation column bottom to<br>
obtain a vacuum light gas oil. A vacuum residual oil obtained after fractionating the<br>
vacuum light gas oil was used as a raw material to be deasphalted. The vacuum residual<br>
oil was deasphalted using a propane as a solvent with solvent ratio of 5.5 and at<br>
predetermined extraction temperature (column top: 90°C, column bottom: 65 °C) to obtain<br>
a deasphalted oil B with a yield of 35 vol% of the vacuum residual oil. The properties are<br>
shown in Table 9.<br>
[0134]<br>
(Solvent-Extraction Step)<br>
The deasphalted oil obtained in the deasphalting step was extracted using the<br><br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent with solvent ratio of 3.0 and at extraction<br>
temperature of 120 °C to obtain an extract E1. The properties are shown in Table 9.<br>
[0135]<br>
(Mixing Step)<br>
The extract E1 was mixed with 10 vol% of a lubricant base oil B1 having<br>
properties shown in Table 10 to obtain a mixed oil having viscosity at 100°C being 60<br>
mm2/s (volume mixing ratio: 90/10). The mixed oil was provided as a process oil of<br>
Example 7 of the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0136]<br>
[Example 8]<br>
The extract E1 obtained in Example 7 was mixed with 30 vol% of a lubricant<br>
base oil B2 having properties shown in Table 10 to obtain a mixed oil having viscosity at<br>
100°C being 60 mm2/s (volume mixing ratio: 70/30). The mixed oil was provided as a<br>
process oil of Example 8 of the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0137]<br>
[Example 9]<br>
The extract E1 obtained in Example 7 was mixed with 7 vol% of a lubricant base<br>
oil B3 having properties shown in Table 10 to obtain a mixed oil having viscosity at<br>
100°C being 60 mm2/s (volume mixing ratio: 93/7). The mixed oil was provided as a<br>
process oil of Example 9 of the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0138]<br>
[Comparison 7]<br>
The vacuum residual oil obtained in Example 7 was deasphalted with solvent<br>
ratio of 7.0 and at predetermined extraction temperature (column top: 75°C, column<br>
bottom: 60 °C) to obtain a deasphalted oil C with a yield of 60 vol% of the vacuum<br>
residual oil. The deasphalted oil C was solvent-extracted under the extraction condition<br>
similar to Example 7 to obtain an extract E2 having properties shown in Table 9. The<br>
extract E2 was mixed with 15 vol% of the lubricant base oil Bl to obtain a mixed oil<br>
having viscosity at 100°C being 60 mm2/s (volume mixing ratio: 85/15). The obtained<br><br>
mixed oil was provided as a process oil of Comparison 7.<br>
[0139]<br>
[Comparison 8]<br>
The extract E2 was mixed with 80 vol% of the lubricant base oil B1 to obtain a<br>
mixed oil (volume mixing ratio: 20/80). The obtained mixed oil was provided as a process<br>
oil of Comparison 8.<br>
[0140]<br>
[Comparison 9]<br>
The extract E2 was mixed with 35 vol% of the lubricant base oil B2 to obtain a<br>
mixed oil (volume mixing ratio: 65/35). The obtained mixed oil was provided as a process<br>
oil of Comparison 9.<br>
[0141]<br>
[Comparison 10]<br>
The extract E2 was mixed with 80 vol% of the lubricant base oil B2 to obtain a<br>
mixed oil (volume mixing ratio: 20/80). The obtained mixed oil was provided as a process<br>
oil of Comparison 10.<br>
[0142]<br>
Properties of the process oils of Examples 7 to 9 are shown in Table 11 with the<br>
properties of the conventional aromatic oil as reference. Also, properties of the process<br>
oils of Comparisons 7 to 10 are shown in table 12. Here, standards or the like for<br>
evaluation are in compliance with those described above.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Test Example 1]<br>
Using the process oils obtained in Examples 7 to 9 and Comparisons 7 to 10<br>
described above, a high styrene rubber and a general-purpose styrene rubber were<br>
manufactured with the formulations of Tables 5 and 6 of the first embodiment.<br>
[0146]<br>
For the obtained high styrene rubbers, generation of bleeding (a phenomenon in<br>
which an oil bleeds on a surface of a rubber) and separation of a wax component were<br>
visually observed. For the obtained general-purpose styrene rubbers, rubber properties<br>
such as elongation, hardness, tensile strength and M 300 (elasticity of a rubber when the<br>
rubber is elongated at elongation percentage of 300%) were measured in compliance with<br>
JIS K6301. Based on the visual observation and measurement, the high styrene rubbers<br>
and general-purpose rubbers were compared and evaluated. The results are shown in<br><br>
Tables 13 and 14.<br>
Note that measurement values of the rubber properties of the general-purpose<br>
styrene rubbers were compared with those of a general-purpose styrene rubber<br>
manufactured using the conventional aromatic oil (refer to Table 11 for its properties).<br>
The evaluations were made using relative values with the measurement values of the<br>
aromatic oil being 100.<br>
[0147]<br><br>
As is clear from the results in table 13, the high styrene rubbers using me process<br><br>
oils of Examples 7 to 9 were free from generation of the bleeding and separation of the<br>
wax component, so that they were verified to be high styrene rubbers having no problem<br>
in use.<br>
In addition, the rubber properties of the general-purpose styrene rubbers using the<br>
process oils of Examples 7 to 9 were not inferior to that using the conventional aromatic<br>
process oil, so that they were verified to have rubber properties equal to those of<br>
conventional process oils.<br>
[0149]<br>
On the other hand, as is clear from the results in table 14, since the extracts used<br>
as the raw materials of the process oils of Comparisons 7 and 9 had high contents of<br>
specified aromatic compound and benzo(a)pyrene, the process oils obtained by mixing<br>
such extracts and the lubricant base oils also had problems in carcinogenicity and safety.<br>
Also, the viscosities at 100°C of the process oils were low, so that the rubber properties<br>
thereof were inferior to the aromatic oil as reference.<br>
As for the process oils of Comparisons 8 and 10, although the contents of the<br>
benzo(a)pyrene and the specified aromatic compound were satisfactory, me aniline points<br>
were high, and bleedings were observed in the high styrene rubbers. Especially, since the<br>
aniline point was quite high in Comparison 10, all of the elongation, tensile strength and<br>
M300 of the general-purpose styrene rubber were poor.<br>
