				<td>EXTRA LIGHT MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEM<br>
This extra light mass transportation invention relates to providing mass transport for cities and for inter cities for men and materials, using lightest coaches not being used by present forms of transports and new kind of wheels arrangement, not being used in present systems. The system also provides track changing arrangement in this invention not possible till date. In particular this invention relates to providing the more economical public transport system as compared to present systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Various forms of public transport systems are presently known in the art including the one for which I already have patent vide patent number!66105 dated 3rd June,19 87.<br>
One such system consists of tram cars, which are capable of carrying in as much as 150 passengers at any one time, however a disadvantage associated with such a system is that of substantial space utilization of roads which are generally over crowded and congested in big cities.<br>
In order to obviate such a disadvantage, yet another system consists of buses. Such a &gt;&gt; siem avoids the disadvantage of using number of trams or coaches required in trams but this system has disadvantage of requirement of high horse power, lot of road space has link passenger carrying capacity. In fact, the seating capacity of a bus does not 50 passengers at a time. Yet another disadvantage is that of a considerable high<br>
talcoa.<br>
found that various other modes of transport are under practice such as, Trains using one wheel at one point of its chassis. The trains also can be used as rapid transit systems and underground Railway systems. The disadvantage of lies in its high cost of investment in capital as well as high running cost The snorter disadvantage of Railways is that of derailment which occurs quite frequently.<br>
La order to obviate this disadvantage yet another system consists of Mono Rails and Public Mover systems using two wheels at one point of its chassis. All these systems are being used in circular form in cities or from point to point on Air Ports or for joining Airports to city centers,. The elevation of such systems is done to save spaces of roads and also these systems are put underground also to save road spaces.<br>
The disadvantage of such systems is that of considerable costs involved with such systems.<br>
The one for which I had patent was based on use of rollers in place of wheels for railways and tyres for mono rails and the system was to be run in tunnels.<br>
The basic flaw of the system was that it could not change tracks, required for larger movement of men and materials and had smaller rollers which could not run on speed.<br>
Although the above systems and a few more known in the art are employed for public transport but the main problems associated with all present systems is that of high costs, pollution and congestion.<br>
The transport system of present invention has the advantage of being Rapid transport system and further avoids the considerable costs of construction, maintenance and running as associated with Railways and similar systems.<br>
Accordingly the primary object of this invention is to propose a public transport system which is rapid and capable of carrying a considerable number of passengers, more than present systems at lower cost than present forms of transport systems.<br>
yet another object of this invention is to propose a public transport system which is efficient.<br>
Yet Another object of this invention is to propose a public transport system which is accident proof and in view of the same is safer mode of transportation system.<br>
yet object of this invention is to propose a public transport system which facilitates economical travel and does not create any pollution in congested and over crowded cities.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a public transport system which is adopted to run at a speed there by reducing the time of travel of passengers.<br>
yet objective of this invention is to provide an efficient rapid transport in most congested and in narrow lanes and roads of cities, villages and towns, not possible by present modes of transports.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a transport system which has capability to change tracks, not possible at present in systems using three wheels at one point.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a transport system which can use lightest coaches to reduce cost, not possible by present technologies.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a transport system which removes all the short comings of my previous patent number 166105 dated 3rd June, 19 87<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an Extra Light Mass Transport System characterized as one which uses three wheels at one point of chassis, the third wheel below the track grips the system to the track which does not let the light coaches to fly off the track when in motion on high speed, the use of light coaches reduces the whole infrastructure requirement, there by reducing the requirement of heavy steel /RCC structure and other related items to bring down the cost of system considerably, the present modes of transports use one wheel at one point of chassis for trains, buses, trams, cars etc, two wheels at one point of chassis for mono rails, public transport systems etc, the system comprises of Steel/ Reinforced Cement Concrete Track which is constructed on ground / underground / supported on pillars/columns of steel / reinforced cement concrete, the track carries plurality of carriages ranging from smallest to largest sizes, being coupled together, a traction member or members connected to said carriages to haul the said carriages, the train formed by plural carriages capable of changing tracks to reach at various destinations even in thin lanes not possible in present systems, having all necessary safety , signaling and no derailment features, carrying more passengers than present modes of transports at less capital as well as running cost as compared to existing systems..<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
At the out set of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention, however such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitations on the scope of this invention. Accordingly the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the transport system consists of a concrete track/ steel track made out in such a way that the track can take on three sets of wheels on it, not being used by any transport system any where, plurality of carriages coupled to each other, and a traction system/multiple traction systems which is/are the driving means to haul the said carriages. The system also has other features required for safety, braking and halt of carriages at proper places on the track.<br>
In particular, the track is made in such a way that it creates very little friction for three wheels to travel at speed. In accordance with this invention and to over come the problem of space utilization of the over crowded and congested cities the said track is constructed over ground i.e. at a level above the city roads which additionally facilitates existing traffic to remain unaffected and remain on roads as it is. The track can also be constructed on Ground where ever spaces along the roads are available, can also be constructed under ground as well.<br>
The carriages of the transport system accordingly to this invention are of a particular construction which make these carriages of very light weight because the use of third<br>
wheel below the track which does not allow the carriages to fly up wards at speed, not possible in present technologies using maximum two wheels at one point . The seating capacity of the carriages is made in such a way that there is enough space for the passengers to enter and exit the carriages and simultaneously allowing for maximum utilization of spaces. The carriages have a particular construction of wheels so as to prevent any derailment of carriages. Further to make this system safer and accident proof according to this invention, fencing of track can be constructed where ever necessary.<br>
It is also possible according to this invention and considering if "X" is the horse power required for the buses, the same horse power can haul number of carriages. Since the carriages are of lower weight as compared to Railways, mono rails, public mover system and buses, it is possible for the transport to run on lower horse power and also take sharp turns as well.The transport system is capable of moving in either directions and also capable of changing tracks to reach the prefixed destinations. The carriages and main driver or traction have proper lighting systems, safety systems, braking systems, emergency braking and other allied electronic controls including allied facilities.<br>
As described herein the transport system of present invention is so compact, there fore, if circumstances arises then this system can be constructed underground and also where ever road crossings in the cities become unmanageable and un construct able the system can pass through the culverts which can be constructed underground or by partly raising the road levels and partly underground. . Still further, the system can be set up in multi layers as well to make the transport system totally uninterrupted.<br>
For a better understanding of the nature of this invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings wherein.<br>
Figure 1 Shows the transport system in accordance with this invention and which is constructed at elevated height. The track is built at a height above the road level. The present traffic continues to ply as it is under the tracks, where as a number of coaches, with traction system operate independently to transport the passengers or materials. There can be two way trains or one way train depending upon the requirements.<br>
Figure 2 shows the attachment of coaches with the track at an elevation or on ground or underground. The coaches have three sets of wheels attached to its chassis at one point The top wheel is meant for traction , the side wheel for providing direction to the trains, the bottom wheel is meant to keep the trains fastened to the track and not to allow the train to go off the tracks on speed. The bottom wheel also stops the upliftment of light coaches at speed when the air surrounding the system tries to up lift the coaches. There is appropriate gap between the wheels/tyres and the track walls so as to allow free movement of wheels on the track.<br>
Figure 3     Shows the section of two trains and attachment of coaches with the track.<br>
Figure 4  shows independent view of the couch.<br>
Figure 5 Shows the details of crossing on ground level adjacent to Roads where partially the road level is increased and partially the ground is dug up to provide a safe crossing of trains<br>
Figure 6 Shows elevated Station where ever required if the track is elevated.<br>
Figure 7 Shows two sets of tracks. One above the other for two directions of tracks for providing track changing arrangements.<br>
Figure 8 Shows the track twist or turning up side down of one track over the other to provide the connection of track for second or other direction.<br>
Figure 9 Shows the side view of two tracks 1 and 2 , one above the other and Motor -gears arrangement used to turn up side down of tracks for providing the required direction to the train.<br>
Figure 10 Shows the side view of the train.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
