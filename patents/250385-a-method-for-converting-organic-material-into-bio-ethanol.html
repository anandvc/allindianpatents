The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for converting organic material into a burnable substance, typically a hydrocarbon fuel, such as ethanol.<br>
Background<br>
The world's energy demand is increasing, and the fossil fuel sources are depleted, leading to increasing competition for the available energy sources, and thereby hampering economic growth by high energy prices. To overcome this situation, renewable energy sources must be brought into exploitation. With the present-day technology, the only renewable energy source which has sufficient capacity to cover significant parts of the energy demand is biomass conversion. Biomass is efficiently converted into heating and electricity by existing technologies, but transportation fuels, which accounts for one third of the total energy consumption, must be available as high energy density fluids, preferably compatible with fossil fuels like diesel oil and gasoline. Therefore technologies for transforming and intensifying the energy content of biomass are required.<br>
Methods for producing bio-ethanol are known. It typically involves a number of unit operations such as feedstock preparation, fermentation and by-product purification. Each of these unit operations may comprise several unit operations. Such prior art method have a number of draw backs. Firstly, bio-ethanol is mainly produced from starch and sugar rich biomass such as corn and wheat grain. Already in the feedstock harvesting step Vz to 2/3 of the plant material is often rejected, and mainly the seeds are used in the fermentation. Various methods are being developed to increase the amount of plant material which can be converted in the conversion step. Such methods include enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch to produce glucose which can be converted in the fermentation. Typically the entire feed stock is processed i.e. the feed pulp also includes the cellulostic parts and other materials, which are not converted in the fermentation. Hence, prior art methods include<br>
up-grading the residual material from the fermentation to a dry material after separation from the ethanol produced. This upgraded material may be used as cattle feed. The market for the upgraded by-product is not expected to match the production, if a large number of bio-ethanol plants are put into operation. It is therefore desirable to find an alternative use of the by-product. Secondly many of the unit operations involved in prior art method have a relative high energy consumption thereby increasing the production cost of the bio-ethanol. Thirdly a<br><br>
large amount of the plant installation cost is related to up-grading of the residual material e.g. decanting and drying, and especially the drying is very energy consuming. Furthermore, existing methods for producing bio-ethano) is limited to specific feed stock. It is highly desirable to enable conversion of other materials such as waste materials eventually in to other types of products, such as oils.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide an improved method and an improved apparatus for converting organic material, such as waste, sludge, biomass etc., into hydrocarbon products, such as hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for more effective production of fermentation products such as bio-ethanol. Efficiency in this context should be interpreted in broad terms such as cost efficiency, energy efficiency, yield, new uses of residual products etc.<br>
It is still another objective to provide a method and apparatus expanding the amount and types of organic materials that can be converted by the process,<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide an improved recyclable product from the conversion of organic material, which improved product is reusable as some kind of energy. These objectives and several others objectives, which will become evident below, are obtained by a first aspect of the present invention by providing a method for converting organic material into hydrocarbon fuel, such as ethanol, the method comprising<br>
•	a  fermentation   process   fermenting  the   organic   material   thereby  providing  a fermentation broth,<br>
•	a separation process separating the fermented material into a hydrocarbon fuel and a residual product,<br>
•	a conversion process at least partly converting the residual product into energy,<br>
•	energy distribution process distributing at least some of the energy provided by the conversion process to the fermentation process.<br><br>
The separation process may also be termed a purification process.<br>
The conversion into energy typically, but not exclusively, includes a conversion into thermal energy such as heat.<br>
The term "hydrocarbon fuel" is to be understood in broad sense, typically as a burnable substance containing hydrocarbons, such as hydrocarbon based fuel, which may or may not comprise other elements than carbon and hydrogen, e.g. some of said hydrocarbons may comprise oxygen and other elements e.g. in the form of groups of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers and reaction products thereof. In particular hydrocarbons according to the present invention include oils, such as bio-crude, bio-oil, bio-diesel, and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol,<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention involves the hydrocarbon fuel comprises ethanol. Further said ethanol production may have an overall positive energy economy, and the yield of ethanol may be substantially unchanged by said conversion process.<br>
Ethanol production according to the present invention often comprise farther comprising one or more pre-treatment process producing a mash from the organic material for the fermentation process. Such pre-treatment process may comprise a milling of the organic material such a milling by a wet and/or dry milling. In this milling process the feedstock material is divided into smaller parts. Water may be added either before the milling step (wet milling) or after the milling (dry milling) to produce a feed pulp. Normally the entire feedstock is processed, i.e. the feed pulp includes also the cellulostic and protein part of the seeds. The pre-treatment may further include a liquefaction step. Enzymes may be added to the pulp in the liquefaction step to break down the plant material structure by hydrolysis and liberate starch from the seeds. The starch is further hydrolysed to smaller sugars - dextrins. Still further the pre-treatment may include a subsequent saccharification step. In this step dextrins may be broken down to low molecular weight sugars suitable for fermentation. The saccharification may be performed by enzymatic hydrolysis using a mixture of enzymes.<br>
A preferred embodiment according to the present invention is where at .least 50 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution<br><br>
process, such as at least 70 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and preferably at least 80 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as at least 90 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and even more preferably at least 95 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as substantially all of the heat required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process.<br>
In most embodiments according to the present invention the fermentation process takes place in a fluid, preferably being water. The fermentation process often comprises converting sugar(s) by use and/or addition of micro organism(s), such as yeast, and/or bacterias such as thermolabile bacterias directly and/or indirectly into the fermentation broth comprising hydrocarbon fuel(s). Often the fermentation process takes place at a temperature between 24-36°C for 24-96 hours in an environment with a pH around 4-5.<br>
The separation process preferably comprises distilling the fermentation broth whereby at least a' part of the hydrocarbon fuel is separated from the fermentation broth. Additionally, substantial all of the hydrocarbon fuel and residual products present in the fermentation broth is separated subsequent to the fermentation process, and wherein substantially all of the hydrocarbon fuel present in the fermentation broth is distilled off. Furthermore, the hydrocarbon fuel may preferably be ethanol, and the ethanol after said distillation process is preferably substantially in the form azeotropic mixture of ethanol and water.<br>
The method according to the present invention may preferably further comprise a hydrocarbon fuel separation process, wherein water is removed from the hydrocarbon fuel. Additionally, said further hydrocarbon separation process may include a membrane process such as a pervaporation. Alternatively or in combination thereto, water may be removed from said hydrocarbon fuel by a molecular sieving process. The molecular sieving process may preferably include a zeolite.<br>
The separation process for separating said hydrocarbon fuel from the fermentation broth is an energy demanding process. Hence, in a preferred embodiment according to the present invention at least 50 % of the energy required for said separation process is being supplied by<br><br>
said energy distribution process, such as at least 10 % of the energy required for said separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and preferably at least 80 % of the energy required for said separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as at least 90 % of the energy required for said separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and even more preferably at least 95 % of the energy required for said separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as substantially all of the heat required for said separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process.<br>
The remaining fermentation broth subsequent to said separation process for separation and separation of said hydrocarbon fuel, hereinafter called the fermentation rest or residual product typically may include unconverted starch, other organics from the feed stock like cellulostic material, proteins and other feed stock cell material as well as dead yeast cells, microorganisms, enzymes etc. Known techniques typically process this fermentation rest or residual product to animal fodder which can be usf*d to feed e.g catties. Such processing typically include numerous steps including decanting and/or drying operatins so as to obtain a substantially dry material called "Dried distilled Grains with solubles (DDGS), which is sold as animal fodder. The processing steps involved have a high energy consumption and the value of the animal fodder product is relatively low. Hence, such upgrading of the residual product adds to the processing costs and makes it less competitive. Further the market for such upgraded by-product is not expected to match the production of the hydrocarbon fuel, if a larger number of such plants are put into operation.<br>
Hence, it is desirable to find alternative uses of this fermentation rest or residual product. The present invention provides a method for converting such residual product by to some kind of energy and at least partly distributing this energy back to the pre-treatment process and/or the fermentation process and/or the separation process.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the method according to the present invention at least 50 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process is being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as at least 70 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and preferably at least 80 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process being<br><br>
, supplied by said energy distribution process, such as at least 90 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and even more preferably at least 95 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as substantially all of the heat required for said pre-treatment process, fermentation process, and separation process being supplied by said energy distribution process.<br>
One embodiment said conversion process for converting said residual product comprises a combustion process and/or a gasification process and/or a pyrolysis process. Said combustion and/or gasification and/or a pyrolysis process for converting said residual product to energy may be a thermal process. In such embodiments the conversion process may further comprise a drying process using some kind of waste heat source. Said waste heat source may be a hot gas and/or low pressure steam and/or a hot water, e.g. an excess energy stream from e.g. power and/heat production by prior art processes.<br>
However, the fermentation rest or residual product typically contains more than 80 % water by weight, such as more than 90 % by weight and may contain as much as 95 % by weight, and the energy consumption for evaporating such large amounts of water, makes it difficult to obtain a positive energy.<br>
Hence, in an aspect of the present invention said conversion process occurs in a media such as a fluid such as water and the conversion process occurs without the need to supply the heat of evaporation for the water contained in said fermentation rest or residual product. In one embodiment this is provided by conversion process comprising a bio-gasification, wherein said fermentation rest or residual product is converted into a bio-gas, which may or may not be combusted or burned in a subsequent step so as to provide heat and/or steam and/or a hot water stream for said energy distribution process.<br>
The feedstock to said conversion process according to the present invention may comprise other feedstock materials than said fermentation rest or residual product from the fermentation and/or separation process. Prior art methods typically only use between 3/3 and Vz of the plant material harvested is.used as feedstock to the pre-treatment and fermentation processes, and residues such as leaves and straw is typically not used in the fermentation<br><br>
process for production of hydrocarbon fuels. Such residues from the harvesting may be mixed with said fermentation rest or said residual product prior to said fermentation process, and thereby increase or improve the overall efficiency.<br>
In some embodiments other materials such as waste materials may be mixed with said fermentation rest and/or residual product prior to said conversion process.<br>
An attractive embodiment of the present invention is to conduct said conversion in a high pressure fluid such as in a fluid at a pressure of at least 50 bar, such as at pressure of least 100 bar and preferably at a pressure of at least 150 bar such at a pressure of at least 200 bar such as at a pressure of at least 250 bar. Said fluid may be selected among water and/or alcohols and mixtures thereof. Often said conversion in said high pressure fluid involves a bydrothermal and/or solvothermal conversion process i.e. said conversion at least partly include a thermal degradation of said substances contained in said fluid.<br>
The conversion process may be a combustion process in such high pressure fluid such as a supercritical water oxidation or a partial oxidation process, wherein an oxidant such as oxygen is added to the fluid or fluid mixture so as to at least partially oxidize or convert said organic materials by the action of said oxidant using said fluid as reaction media.<br>
In another embodiment said conversion process in said high pressure fluid comprises conversion by a "wet gasification" and/or "liquefaction" process within said high pressure fluid. Furthermore said gas or liquid may be combusted or conrverted into a another energy source such as hot gas and/or steam and/or hot water before being distributed to said energy distribution process.<br>
An attractive embodiment of the present invention is provided by the use of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts present within said high pressure fluid, thereby enhancing the reaction rate and promoting conversion into a desired product. In many embodiments according to the present invention said homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts comprises at least one compound from the group 1 of the periodic table of elements. In a even more preferable embodiment a heterogeneous catalyst is also present and/or contacted with said high pressure fluid. Said heterogeneous catalysts may comprise at least one of the<br><br>
elements Zr, Ti, Al, Si, Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, W, Mo, V, Sn, Zn, Ru, and preferably said heterogeneous catalyst are present in the form of an oxide and/or oxyhydroxide.<br>
The temperature of said conversion process may according to the present invention may be up to 700 C, such as up to 600 C and preferably up to 500 C such as up 400 C, and even more preferably up to 350 C such as up to 250 C.<br>
The at least one homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts may preferably comprise at least one compound of at least one element from group I of the periodic table and/or at least one compound of at least one element from group IV of the periodic table.<br>
Preferably, at least one homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalyst may be contained in the ash fraction of said substances being fed to said conversion step.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for converting a residual product into hydrocarbon fuels. The residual product is preferably provided by a method according to first aspect of the present invention and the method preferably comprises the steps of:<br>
-	pressurising said residual product in a fluid to a pressure above 225 bar, and<br>
-	heating said residual product in said fluid to a temperature above 200 C in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst comprising a compound of at least one element of group I of the periodic table of elements,<br>
wherein the method further comprises the steps of;<br>
-	contacting said residual product in said fluid with a heterogeneous catalyst comprising a<br>
compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic table and/or alpha-alumina..<br>
Preferably, the method may further comprise a step of assuring that said fluid has initially a pH value of above 7, preferably by adjusting said fluid to have a pH value above 7.<br>
An improved method for converting a residual product into recyclable products is hereby obtained. By contacting the residual product with a heterogeneous catalyst comprising a compound of at least one element of group IVB of the periodic table and/or alpha-alumina, the catalyst may be reused and a continuously converting of residual product is possible. Thereby the amount of catalyst spent for converting one amount of residual product is decreased  whereby  the  cost  for  converting  the  material   is  considerable  decreased.<br><br>
Additionally, the process time has been decreased considerably due to the fact that dividing the catalyst process into two separate processes increases the velocity of conversion.<br>
Furthermore, by adjusting the fluid to above 7 the corrosion of the materials used for the involved components in the apparatus is considerably decreased. The corrosion of these materials has decreased to such an amount that cheap standard materials may be used for the construction of the apparatus.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention the method may comprise the step of maintaining the pH value of said fluid containing said residual product in the range 7-14, such as 7-12 and preferably in the range 7-10 such as in the range 7-9.5, and preferably in the range of 8-10. It is hereby obtained that when converting the residual product into hydrocarbon fuel the corrosion of the materials used for the involved components of the apparatus is substantial decreased to at least an insignificant amount of corrosion.<br>
Furthermore, according to an aspect of the present invention the method may comprise the step of pre-treating the residual product at a pressure of 4-15 bar at the temperature of 100-170 C for a period of 0.5-2 hours. In another aspect of the present invention the method may comprise the step of pre-treating the residual product by an enzymatic treatment at a temperature of 20-100 C. By such a pre-treatment the residual product, the residual product is pre-converted whereby the subsequent conversion may be performed more quickly than without the pre-treatment.<br>
Subsequently, the pre-treating step may according to another aspect of the invention comprise a step of size reducing of the material such as a cutting, grinding, milling, or sieving step or a combination thereof. By such a size reduction the conversion process of the residual product is performed even more quickly than without the size reduction.<br>
Additionally, the pre-treating step may comprise the step of adding additives to the fluid according to the present invention, whereby the conversion process is improved even further in regards to speed of the conversion time and in regards to the resulting product from the conversion of the residual product into hydrocarbon fuels. The product resulting from the conversion of the residual product may by adding these additives be regulated, so that the resulting product may have variable composition of oil, methanol, water, water soluble<br><br>
organics, water soluble salts, etc. It is then possible to adjust the recyclable product in regards to the wishes of the subsequent use of the products.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention the step of pre-treating may comprise the step of adjusting the pH of said fluid comprising said residual product to above 7. It hereby obtained to adjustment of the pH value in the fluid comprising the residual product at an early stage of the conversion process, whereby the process time for the conversion is reduced.<br>
By the step of pre-treating the fluid comprising the residual product it is possible to increase the amount of solid-state material in the fluid, which again leads to a higher rate of conversion and thereby a higher production capacity. This results in a more efficient and cost saving converting of organic material.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention the method may further comprise a step of separating particles from the fluid comprising the organic material. By separating particles before contacting the fluid comprising the residual product with the heterogeneous catalyst the product resulting from the conversion process, such as oil, is then substantially free of being bound to these particles and therefore much more reusable straight after this conversion process. A second process, such as an refinery is thereby dispensable.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention the method may further comprise a second step of heating the fluid. The temperature of fluid comprising the residual product is hereby adjustable just before contacting the heterogeneous catalyst, whereby the process is optimised, which leads to a reduced process time. Furthermore, by separating the particles away from the fluid at such an early stage a substantially amount of energy for transporting the separated particles is saved, which again decreases the amount of energy spend in the conversion process as a total.<br>
Additionally, the method may according to the invention comprise a second separating of particles, which step is merely for safety reason in regards to the first step of separating particles. This step reduces for the same reasons as the first step of separating particles the total amount of energy spend for the conversion process.<br><br>
Furthermore, the method may according to the invention comprise a step of cooling the fluid. By cooling the fluid the resulting product from converting of the residual product may be optimized in relations to the composition of product.<br>
Advantageously, the step of cooling may according to the present invention be performed by heat exchanging with the first step of heating and/or a step of pre-heating the fluid in the pre-treating step. It is hereby obtained to reuse the heat from the fluid, which needs to cool down before the second part of conversion into the recyclable products, in the fluid in the first part of conversion process before contacting the fluid with the heterogeneous catalyst. The total amount of energy for the converting of residual product is thereby kept to a minimum.<br>
Said method may according to one aspect the present invention further comprise a step of separating gas from the fluid, such as fuel gas. By separating this gas one kind of recyclable product is obtained, which was an objective of the invention.<br>
The method may according to one aspect the present invention further comprise the step that the fuel gas is used for heating the fluid in the second heating step. By using the separated gas it is reused in converting the residual product and therefore reusable.<br>
Furthermore, the method may according to the invention further comprise a step of separating the fluid into water and water soluble organics from oil and water soluble salts in a first separating unit such as a membrane-filter. By this separating a recyclable products is obtained and a further converting into recyclable products is possible.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention the water and water soluble organics are transformed into electricity in a direct methanol fuel cell. This is one way of using one of the recyclable products of the present invention. It may also be regarded as a subsequent step of converting the recycle products into a usable product in form of electricity.<br>
The method may also according to another aspect of the present invention comprise a second step of separating, such as filtering water soluble organics from the water, such as an separation of methanol in a second separating unit such as a membrane-filter. By this conversion step one recycle product is obtained.<br><br>
Subsequently, said one or more separation units may be selected from the group of phase separators, centrifuges, membrane processes comprising ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, reverse osmosis or pervaporation or a combination thereof. By this selection different kinds of recycle products are obtainable.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the water and water soluble organics after the second separation step may be transformed into drinkable water in a process of reverse osmosis. By the method comprising the process of reverse osmosis one very usable recyclable product is obtained.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the water soluble organic may comprising up-concentrated methanol may be re-circulated to the pre-treating step. A further optimization of the converting method is hereby obtained, and the converted product of up-concentrated methanol is reused.<br>
Additionally, the method may according to one aspect of the invention comprise a phase separator, whereby separation of oil as product is obtained.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the step of contacting the residual product in the fluid with a heterogeneous catalyst may be performed while the temperature is kept substantially constant. By keeping the temperature constant in the contacting step the contacting of the fluid with the heterogeneous catalyst is kept in the same condition and the conversion is therefore constant throughout the contacting step. A further advantage is that the equilibriums and reaction rates of the chemical reactions involved in the conversion are kept constant throughout the contacting step, thereby ensuring uniformity in the products formed by the conversion.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the temperature in the step of contacting may be in the range 200-650 °C, such as in the range 200-450 °C, and preferably in the range 200-374 °C, and even more preferably in the range 250-374 °C, such as in the range 275-350 °C. By keeping these low temperatures the conversion process is using less energy in converting the same amount of residual product than at higher temperatures. A low temperature together<br><br>
with a pH value above 7 decreases the corrosion of the materials used for the apparatus in which the present method is performed.'<br>
A low temperature in the contacting step increases the fraction of the residual product being converted into hydrocarbon fuels, and thereby the oil production capacity of the contacting step. At such low temperatures the solubility of salts is high compared to higher temperature whereby the conversion process is further advantageous due to almost no salts depositing occurs inside the apparatus. Furthermore, at such low temperatures the residual product is less converted into soot and tar, which products are not very recyclable. Finally such low temperature allows construction of the apparatus from less corrosion resistant materials, further improving the competitive.<br>

The drawings are schematically and shown for the purpose of illustration.<br>
Fig.l is an example of a conventional bio-ethanol production process. Bio-ethanol is conventionally produced by fermentation of grain, corn or other plant seeds, which are rich in starch. Only the seeds enter the bio-ethanol process, while the rest of plant is separated from the seeds and used for other purposes.<br>
The bio-ethanol production process involves a quite complex chemical plant, as energy integration is the key to successful process design. The process comprises a number of unit operations, which may be organized into four main process steps:<br>
1.	Feedstock preparation<br>
2.	Fermentation<br>
3.	Bio-ethanol separation<br>
4.	Residual product upgrading<br>
The feedstock pre-treatment may include milling, in which the feedstock material is mechanically divided into smaller parts. Water may be added either before the milling (wet<br><br>
milling) or after the milling (dry milling) to produce a feed pulp. Normally the entire feedstock is processed, i.e. the feed pulp includes also the cellulostic and protein part of the seeds. Enzymes may be added to the pulp in the liquefaction step to break down the plant material structure by hydrolysis and liberate starch from the s^eds. The starch is further hydrolysed to smaller sugars - dextrins. In a subsequent saccriarification step dextrins may be broken down to low molecular weight sugars suitable for fermentation. The sacchairification may be performed by enzymatic hydrolysis using a mixture of enzymes.<br>
One of the major energy consumptions in prior art methods are jn the pre-treatment process, and hence in a preferred embodiment according to the present invention at least 50 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied Dy said energy distribution process, such as at least 70 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and preferably a\ least 80 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as at least 90 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, and even more preferably at least 95 % of the energy required for said pre-treatment process being supplied by said energy distribution process, such as substantially of the energy required for said pre-treatrrient process being supplied by said energy distribution process.<br>
The feed pulp is fermented ethanol by addition of yeast or by thermolabile microorganism such as thermolabile bacterias. Glucose and other low molecufar weight sugars may be converted during the fermentation process, while all other organic parts of the feedstock are remaining unconverted in the fermentation broth. During fermentation carbon dioxide is liberated from the fermentation process.<br>
The ethanol separation step includes distillation of the fermentation broth to separate an azeotropic ethanol/water mixture. Water may be removed from the mixture by zeolite molecular sieving or similar processes, producing almost water free bio-ethanol (99,9 % pure).<br>
The remaining fermentation broth, i.e. the distillation rest inchjding unconverted starch, other organics from the feedstock like cellulostic material, proteins ^nd other feedstock cell material as well as dead yeast cells, is processed to produce anjmal fodder. The processing<br><br>
inculdes numerous steps, including decanting and drying, to end with a dry material - Dried Distilled Grains with Solubles (DDGS), which is sold as animal fodder.<br>
The main energy consumptions in the process are heating during liquefaction and saccharifi cation, as these conversions are performed at elevated temperatures (65 -110 °C), heat for the distillation performed at 80 °C and heat for regeneration of the molecular sieves used in the ethanol separation.<br>
Fig 2 is generalized flow sheet of an embodiment of a bio-ethanol production according to the present invention. Bio-ethanol is produced by the conventional process by fermentation of grains. But the wet residual product is used for energy production in an energy conversion step, as illustrated in figure 3. The produced energy may be used in the bio-ethanol production.<br>
The energy conversion process may be, but is not limited to, conventional drying and combustion technologies, or biogas production. Further a number of new energy production technologies for conversion of the dried product are available, like hydrolysis and gasification. But particularly well suited methods for the energy conversion include high-pressure water based technologies such as supercritical water oxidation, supercritical wet gasification, hydrothermal upgrading or catalytic conversion in high pressure water.<br>
Fig 3 shows the energy distribution of a preferred embodiment of a bio-ethanol production according to the present invention. A feed stream of 1 t/h of plant material is harvested and-fed into the process. The plant material is composed of 60 % grains and 40 % leaves and straw. The grain fraction contains 70 % sugar, 10 % of inorganics and 20 % residual material that contains SO % carbon. The straw and leave ash/inorganics. Water in an amount of 4 times the amount of grain is added to grains. The grain fraction of the plant is introduced in the bio-ethanol process, where it is submitted to a pre-treatment step described in figure 1. This pre-treatment step comprises a milling unit operation and a liquefaction step. The liquefied starch-containing material is commonly called "mash".<br>
Milling is used as pre-treatment to open up the material structure before the liquefaction. Two main processes are commonly used: wet and dry milling.<br><br>
Wet milling gives a good separation of germ and starch granules and is mostly used when a parallel production of syrup is found in the process. It allows to separate the grain into its different fractions (starch, germ, fibers oil and protein) and to produce a variety of diverse co-products such as starch, corn oil.<br>
In dry milling, the whole kernel is milled and used in the process. The ground meal is thereafter liquefied, saccharified and fermented to make ethanol. In this case, only ethanol and distilled grains are recovered.<br>
In the following liquefaction step, the long chained starch-containing material is degraded (hydrolyzed) into maltodextrins (dextrins). Knowing that the starch containing materia! is heated to a temperature above the gelatinization temperature (above 85°C), the liquefaction helps the handling by thinning the starch containing slurry, adding bacterial alpha-amylase (and also on a limited basis acid treatment). Liquefaction is usually carried out at temperatures around 105 to 110°C for about 5-10 min, followed by a lower temperature holding period of about 1-2 hours at 95°C. The pH is maintained around 4.5-6.5 to avoid any bacterial growth. Different possible heating steps may be applied. A preliminary liquefaction step is usually carried out (80-85°C and pH of 4 during 15 to 40 min with alpha amylases enzymes added to initiate the liquefaction) followed by jet cooking (temperature between 105-125°C during 1-5 min) and a third liquefaction stage at 70-85°C for 15-80 min (with addition of thermostable acid alpha-amylase that allows decreasing the fermentation time and increasing efficiency by reducing the residual starch left over during the fermentation).<br>
In the following saccharification step, the maltodextrin contained in the mash is converted to low molecular sugars that can be metabolized by fermenting micro organisms in the fermentation stage. The saccharification is generally carried out enzymatically (using enzymes like glucoamylase, alpha-glucosidase, acid alpha-amylase), with temperatures around 30-65°C (typically 60°C), during 24 to 72 hours and pH around 4-6. It may be advantageous to add some nutrients (yeast extracts), salts (NaCI and ammonium sulfate) and other enzymes (cellulases, Iremicellulase, xylanase...) to the liquefied mash during saccharification .<br>
In the following fermentation step, suitable fermenting micro organisms (yeast) convert sugars in the mash directly or indirectly into the fermentation products, preferably ethanol. Generally, the fermentation is ongoing for 24-96 hours and between 24-36°C, with pH around<br><br>
4-5. The temperature and pH during fermentation are set to be suitable for the microorganisms used. It may be advantageous to add some nutrients, salts (NaCl and ammonium sulfate) and enzymes (cellulases, hemicellulase) to the hydrolyzed starch and sugars during fermentation.<br>
Saccharification may also be done simultaneously with fermentation. In this case, the enzymes and micro-organisms are added together. This simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process (SSF) is a widely used process in the ethanol production. The SSF process is usually conducted at temperatures above 34°C in the presence of glucoamylase and thermo tolerant yeast. The advantage to carry out this step at elevated temperature is that less cooling is required after the initial liquefaction step (occurring at much higher temperature). Simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification and fermentation (LSF) are also found in industry. In a continuous fermentation process, the mash is flowing through several fermentation processes until the mash is fully fermented while in the batch case, the mash stays in one fermentor for an effective amount of time.<br>
In the SSF process, a pre-saccharification step (1 to 4 hours) is usually done (before or simultaneously with the saccharification and fermentation steps), with temperature between 30 to 65°C and pH around 4.5.<br>
Distillation is thereafter performed on the fermentation broth from the fermentation step to recover the fermentation products (ethanol preferably). The fermentation and distillation steps may be carried out simultaneously or separately/sequentially.<br>
After distillation, two products are recovered": Ethanol and a fermentation rest or residual product (whole stillage). The ethanol typically being an azeotropic mixture with water is further purified in the separation step by molecular sieving.<br>
The fermentation rest or residual product is mixed with the straw and leaves from the plant, and introduced into a conversion process in high pressure water according to the present invention. The conversion process comprises a further pre-treatment process, a first heating process, a second heating process (trim heating), a reaction process (not shown), a first cooling process, a second cooling process, and a separation process. The conversion process is shown and described in more details in the figures 5-9 below and in the illustrative examples. The conversion process converts the organics into hydrocarbons such as a bio-oil.<br><br>
Part of the hydrocarbons are combusted in an energy production and energy is distributed to supply the energy consumptions in pre-treatment process (0,18 MW) and separation processes (0,63 MW) of the bio-ethanol production process. As the conventional dewatering process is eliminated and this typically consumes approximately the same amount of energy as the pre-treatment and separation processes, the energy consumption for bio-ethanol production has been significantly reduced.<br>
Using all parts of the plant including straws and leaves, a process self-supplying with energy and having an overall positive energy balance is provided.<br>
The bio-ethanol production may typically be substantially the same as in prior art methods (0,224 t/h), and addition here to a co-production of valuable hydrocarbons such as bio-oil (0,145 t/h) is enabled by the current invention.<br>
Hence, the overall result is a more efficient process for production of bio-ethanol<br>
In the following a preferred embodiment of converting the residual product into energy and in particular in to a hydrocarbon fuel will be disclosed. The residual product contains among other species organic material.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic drawing of the laboratory set-up used for the tests given in the examples. The pre-treated fluid containing the homogeneous catalysts and organic material to be converted is supplied to the system at the position A. The fluid is pressurized by means of the pump 1 and is heated to approximately 230 C in the heater 2, comprising a heat exchanger and a temperature controller (TIC). A second fluid is supplied to the system at position B. This stream is pressurized by means of the pump 3 and heated in the heater 4, comprising a heat exchanger and a temperature controller (TIC), to the temperature necessary to obtain the desired conversion temperature of the mixed fluid streams at position 4. The heterogeneous catalyst is located in the tubular catalytic reactor 5. After contact with the heterogeneous catalyst, the fluid containing the converted organic material is cooled to ambient temperature in the cooler 6, and filtered in the filter 7 for separation and collection of suspended particles. Subsequently the fluid is expanded to ambient pressure over the valve 8. The system pressure is maintained by controlling the flow through 8, utilizing the pressure controller (PIC). The expanded fluid temperature is measured with the thermocouple 9. The liquid fraction of the stream is collected in a liquid trap 10, and the gas is vented off from the trap at position G.<br><br>
The flow rate and composition of the produced gas is continuously measured by a gas meter placed in H (not shown). The composition of the gas is analysed by gas chromatography (not shown) of a small sample taken through I, at controlled pressure established by the flow control valve and pressure controller (PIC) 11.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a schematic drawing of a preferred aspect of a method according to the present invention. Organic material for conversion is received in a feed storage (not shown on the figure). Said organic material may comprise a wide range of biomass and wastes, and may also comprise fossil fuels such coal, shale, orimulsion, heavy fractions of crude oil etc. Many aspects according to the present invention involve treatment of organic material from a mixture of different sources of material as just mentioned.<br>
The feed storage will typically have a capacity corresponding to three days of plant operation. The feed storage is preferably a concealed and agitated silo, such as an agitated concrete silo. A fluid containing the organic material is pumped to the pre-treatment step 1 at position A.<br>
The first part of the pre-treatment comprises in this aspect a size reduction of the feed e.g. by cutting, grinding, milling and/or sieving the material. This size reduction may be an integral part of feeding pump (not shown). During the feeding operation to the pre-treatment the pressure of the fluid containing the organic material to be treated is increased to a pressure in the range 4-15 bars. In the second part of the pre-treatment the fluid containing said organic material is typically maintained in a pre-treatment vessel for a period of 0.5-2 hours. The pre-treatment vessel is preferably an agitated vessel, which is maintained at a temperature of 100-170 C, and preferably in the range 110 to 140 C. The energy for this pre-heating of said fluid comprising said organic material to be converted is preferably supplied, by recovering heat from one of the process streams to be cooled: In the figure this is illustrated by integrating the heat exchanger 2 in a vessel for recovery of heat from the process stream D.<br>
The pH in the vessel is adjusted to a value above 7, and preferable in the range 8-10. This pH adjustment is in many aspects according to the present invention performed by adding additives to the vessel, e.g. by adding a base, which may also comprise an element of group IA of the periodic table. Non-limiting examples of such additives are KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, Na2CO3, ash from biomass or coal combustion. Such additives may be added to the vessel through the stream S.<br><br>
During the residence in the pre-treatment vessel larger molecules such as cellulose, hemicellulose and Iignin are hydrolyzed, and cells from biomass addition are opened facilitating the release of cell contents, such as salts. For a number of potential feedstock this cell opening involve release of catalysts such as potassium from the feedstock itself, thereby allowing for a very efficient process. A number of other additives may also enhance the pre-conversion of the organic material and are further advantageous for the subsequent processing. Such other additives include alcohols, such as methanol, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and/or ketones. In a preferred aspect of the invention a number of such additives being utilized in the pre-treatment, are produced in-situ in the process and re-circulated to the pre-treatment step as shown by the streams E and F. Typical compositions of these recirculation streams is further described in relation to the figures 6-8.<br>
A fluid stream containing pre-converted organic material is withdrawn from pre-treatment vessel by the feed pump 3, and pressurized to the operating pressure e.g. 250 bars. The feed pump may comprise a plunger pump.<br>
After pressurization the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material, the homogeneous catalyst and other additives is heated in the first heating step 4 by heat exchange with the hot converted product stream from the catalytic reactor. The temperature of the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material will in many applications according to the present invention be in the order of 20-30 °C below the operating temperature of the catalytic reactor. During this first heating step the organic material in the feed is further thermally decomposed. A number of undesirable side reactions may proceed during this thermal decomposition, such soot and char formation. Besides reducing the overall efficiency of the process, the may lead to operational problems such as plugging or reduced efficiency of heat exchanger, and deposition on downstream equipment. The aforementioned additives reduce these undesirable side reactions and enhance further the conversion of the organic material into desirable products.<br>
From the heat exchanger 4, the fluid containing said pre-converted organic material may pass a first particle separation device 5 for collection of suspended particles, which may be formed during said pre-con vers ion -luring heat-up. This particles separation device 5 may comprise<br><br>
any conventional means for particle separation, e.g. a cyclone, a filter, a gravimetric settling<br>
4<br>
chamber etc. Particles collected are withdrawn from the process shown by the stream B.<br>
After the first particle separation device 5 the fluid containing said pre-converted organic material is mixed with a re-circulating stream from the catalytic reactor. This mixing will typically increase the temperature of the mixed fluid with 10-20 C, and the recirculation will further introduce desirable compounds for the further conversion into the feed. After mixing with the re-circulation stream the mixed fluid passes to a trim-heater (second heating unit) 6, wherein the temperature is raised to the operating temperature of the catalytic reactor 7. The trim-heater 6 may in many aspects according to the present invention be a gas or oil fired heater, and is preferably at least partly fuelled by re-circulating gas and/or other fuel products produced in the process. In a preferred aspect, this trimheater is fuelled by re¬circulating the produced gas denoted I.in fig. 3. The re-circulation of said produced gas I may include a separation step.<br>
In the catalytic reactor 7, the fluid containing homogeneous catalyst, additives, and pre-converted organic material is contacted with the heterogeneous catalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst will typically be contained in a tubular fixed bed, and the catalytic reactor may comprise multiple tubular fixed beds. During the conversion a dissolved fuel gas, a water soluble organics and an oil is generally produced. The product distribution is adjustable within a wide range of concentration of resulting products as shown in the examples below, and may be controlled by selecting a suitable combination of residence time, re-circulation flow rate, reaction temperature, and concentration of homogeneous catalyst and additives.<br>
Part of the product stream from the catalytic reactor is re-circulated by the pump 8, and mixed with the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material as described above. The remaining part corresponding to the mass flow of the fluid containing the pre-converted organic material before mixing with the re-circulating stream is withdrawn to the second particle separation device 9. As for the first particle separation device this second particles separation device may comprise any conventional means for particle separation e.g. a cyclone, a filter, a gravimetric settling chamber etc. The main feature is to provide a hot separation of potential suspended particles produced oil prior to cooling and expansion to avoid adsorption of the oil to the suspended particles. However, in a number of applications of the present invention e.g. for feedstock with a low ash content this particle separation<br><br>
device may be optional. Particles collected in the second particle separation device are withdrawn from the process shown by the stream C.<br>
Subsequent to the passage of the second particle separation device the fluid stream is cooled in by heat exchange with the feed stream in the heat exchanger 4, and in the heat exchanger 2 and expanded to a pressure in the range 75-225 bars over the expansion valve 10, and separated in the product recovery system 11. Some of the separated fluid stream from the product recovery system 11, such as the streams F and/or E may be re-circulated to the pre-treatment step as described'above. The product recovery system 11 is further illustrated and described below in the figures 6-9.<br>
The separation system, illustrated in figure 6, comprises a gas-liquid separator 12, separating the gas products in stream I and the liquid products in stream J. In an aspect the gas product is used internally for fuelling the trimheater 6. The liquid products are further separated in a first membrane filter 13. The membrane filtration separation is pressure driven, and in many applications applying a nano- or ultrafiltration membrane. The filtration retentate in stream L includes parts of the feed water, the oil product and the dissolved inorganic compounds, e.g. salts from the feedstock and the homogenous catalyst. The oil product is separated from stream L in an oil separator (phase separator unit) 14 operating at atmospheric conditions, and forming the oil product stream H. The remaining water and dissolved inorganic compounds forms stream O. The main part of stream O is recycled to the pre-conversion 1,2 in stream E, thereby recycling the homogenous catalyst, while a purge stream P is discharged to balance the inorganic compound input from the feedstock.<br>
The further processing of the membrane filtration permeate, denoted stream K, is illustrated in figure 7-9. Stream K contains smaller water soluble organics like C 1 - 4 alcohols and carboxylic acids.<br>
In one aspect illustrated in fig. 7 stream K is fed to a separation unit (membrane filter) 15, producing pure water of drinking water quality in stream G and a stream of water soluble organics in stream F. The separation unit 15 is in an aspect of the invention a reverse osmosis membrane unit, comprising a multitude of membrane modules. The retained water soluble organics in stream F are recycled to the pre-conversion step 1, 2.<br><br>
In a further aspect, illustrated in fig. 8, stream K is split into a concentrated water soluble organics stream F and an organics depleted water stream Q. The separation unit 16 involved is in many applications a membrane separation driven by temperature or concentration gradients, like membrane distillation or pervaporation.<br>
The water stream Q is further purified in a polishing step 17, producing the pure water stream G. The polishing step 17 is preferably an activated carbon filter or like means for absorption of very low concentrations of impurities from a water stream.<br>
In an aspect illustrated in fig. 9 the water soluble organic stream K is fed to a direct methanol fuel cell 18, producing electricity and a process water stream R. The direct methanol fuel cell 18 might include feed stream and effluent conditioning steps.<br>
Examples<br>
Illustrative example 1: Conversion of sewage sludge<br>
Anaerobic digested sewage sludge below was converted according to the method of the present invention in the laboratory scale plant shown in fig. 1.<br>
The dry matter content of the sewage sludge was 5 %. The main components of the dry matter in weight % were:<br>
&gt;	C = 28.3%<br>
&gt;	H = 4.33%<br>
&gt;	N = 3.55%<br>
&gt;	0 = 28.4%<br>
&gt;	p = 4.49%<br>
&gt;	Al = 7.77%<br>
&gt;	Si = 7.44%<br>
&gt;	Ca = 6.95%<br>
&gt;	Fe = 3.17%<br>
&gt;	K=1.62%<br>
An elemental analysis of sewage sludge dry matter was further analyzed by induced coupled plasma (ICP) revealing the following composition:<br><br>
C [%]	0[%]	Al [%]	H [%]	Ca [%]	Si [%]	N [%]	P [%]	K [%]<br>
30,9	30.5	6.15	5.2	5.03        4.98	4.66	4.62	236<br><br>
CI [%]	S [%]	Fe [%]	Na [%]	Mg [%J	Zn [%]	Ti [%]	Ba [%]	Mn<br>
[%]<br>
1.13	1.09	1.04	0.938	0.875	0.226	0.195	0.0652	0.0375<br>
The combustible fraction amounts to 58 % of the dry matter content, with a heat value of 22.2 MJ/kg, which translates into a calorific value of 476 KJ/kg in the sewage sludge as received.<br>
Prior to the test the sewage sludge was pre-treated by sizing to less than 1 mm by cutting longer particles by a Seepex macerator (type 25/15-I-I-F12-2) and milling by a colloid mill (Probst und Class, type Nl 00/E), and filtered by a screen basket filter (mesh width 1mm).<br>
Subsequently 1.5 % by weight of potassium in the form of potassium carbonate was added to the resulting slurry. The pH value of the slurry was 9.0.<br>
125 ml of Zr02 heterogeneous catalyst stabilized with 2.2 atomic mole % of Si. The catalyst in the form of cylindrical pellets of 3 mm length and a diameter of 3 mm was added to the tubular reactor.<br>
63 g/h of the pre-treated sewage sludge was pressurized to 250 bars and heated to 230 C in the pre-heating step. This stream was mixed with 393 g/h of pressurized water heated to a temperature so as to obtain a substantially constant temperature of 360 ± 5 C after mixing.<br>
The mixed flow was subsequently contacted with the heterogeneous catalyst in the reactor. The feed to water ratio translates into a water to feed ratio of 6:1, and the total flow of 456 g/h translates into a contact time of approximately 4 minutes.<br>
After to the contact with the heterogeneous catalyst, the fluid containing the converted organic material is cooled to ambient temperature, filtered through a particle filter for<br><br>
collection of suspended particles, and expanded to ambient pressure. The liquid fraction on the stream was collected in a liquid trap, and the gas is vented off.<br>
The experiment resulted in three product streams, a gas, an aqueous product and a solid precipitate. Samples for analysis were collected for a period of \5.5 hours.<br>
Gas analysis<br>
The flow rate and composition of the produced gas was measured continuously by a gas meter with sampling. The composition was measured by gas chromatography.<br>
The analysis of the gas phase revealed the following results:<br><br>

Formic acid [ppm by weight]	10.3<br>
Acetaldehyde [ppm by weight]	104.9<br>
Total amount of carbon in liquid	9.30 g<br>
The inorganic carbon content in the liquid was found primarily to be due to the presence of carbonate.<br>
Solid analysis<br>
The solid fractions were analyzed by means of a total carbon analyzer and by elemental analysis by an induced coupled plasma analyzer (ICP). An organic phase was found to be adsorbed to the inorganic particles under the experimental conditions used.<br>
This organic phase was extracted prior to the solid analysis using CfyClj. The extractable fraction of the organic carbon was found to be an oil phase, primarily consisting of saturated hydrocarbons with a chain length of 12 to 16 carbon atoms, and there for comparable to fuel or diesel oil. The oil contained 2-hexadecanone, heptadecane, 6,10-dimethyl-2-undecanone, hexadecane, 3-methyl-indole, 2-tridecanone and other compounds.

Use of microwave heating in a catalytic liquid conversion process<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention for conversion of organic material in high pressure water is given in the figures 1-6.<br>
An alternative embodiment, which may be advantageous in many applications according to the present invention, is the use of microwave heating for at least part of the heating process.<br>
Such heating by combining existing microwave generators (known from kitchen microwave owens) combined with high pressure cells comprises a transparent window and may have one or more of the following advantages compared to conventional heaters based on electrical heat and/or superheated steam and/or other heat transfer fluids:<br>
a.	Improved heat transfer efficiency<br>
b.	Extremely short response time<br>
c.	Very accurate process control<br>
d.	Hot spots are avoided<br>
e.	High temperature heat transfer surfaces is avoided<br>
f.	Less thermal cracking of the organic content<br>
g.	Higher conversion rates<br>
h.	High temperature uniformity<br>
i.	Increased conversion capacity<br>
j.	Increased energy efficiency of the overall process<br>
k.	Reduction of temperature needed for conversion<br>
1.	Reduction the size of heat exchangers and cost of heat recovery in general<br>
m.	Reduced chemical consumption and/or allow other catalysts to be used<br>
n.	Simplification of the overall process and/or the related capital and/or operating costs<br>
o.	Smaller foot print<br>
Such microwave heating generally involve heating by magnetron systems operating within the frequency domain of microwaves and/or hyper-frequencies such as frequencies in the range from 300 MHz to 300 GHz such as in the range 500 MHz to 5 GHz. A microwave heating system may comprise multiple magnetrons, which may increase the overall microwave efficiency by reducing the thermal losses.<br><br>
Different frequencies may initiate different energy transfer mechanisms within the materials being treated, which may be used to impact on reaction thermodynamics or product quality.<br>
A further attractive effect of the microwave heating may be the opportunity to significantly reduce the temperature needed for a given conversion of organics according to the present invention. Hence, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the maximum temperature in the process is below 300 °C such as below 275 °C, and preferably below 250 °C such as below 225 °C, and even more preferably below 175 °C. Depending on the specific materials being converted the temperature may be as low as 150 °C such as in the range 110-150 °C.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the maximum temperature is substantially the same as in said pretreatment step according o the present invention.<br>
Additionally the following are definitions used in the description of the present invention.<br>
The term hydrocarbon fuel is in the present invention intended to define all hydrocarbon based fuels, which may or may not comprise other elements than carbon and hydrogen, e.g. some of said hydrocarbons may comprise oxygen and other elements e.g. in the form of groups of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acid, ester, esthers etc. and reaction products thereof.<br>
The membrane processes of the present invention is well known in the prior art (e.g. W.S. HO et al, "Membrane Handbook", Van Nordstrand Reinhold, p. 103-132,p.263-446, 1992, ISBN 0-442-23747-2, K. Scott, "Handbook of Industrial Membranes" Elsevier Science Publishers, 1995, p. 3-163, ^. 331-355, p.575-630, ISBN 1 85617 233 3)<br>
The surface areas referred to throughout this specification and claims are, preferably, the nitrogen BET surface areas determined by the method described in the article by Brunauer, P. Emmett and E. Teller, J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 60, p. 309 (1938). This method depends on the condensation of nitrogen into the pores, and is effective for measuring pores with pore diameters in the range of 10 A to 600 A. The volume of nitrogen adsorbed is related to the surface area per unit weight of the support.<br><br>
It is well known in the prior art that the activity of a catalyst is proportional to the surface area (BET), and that catalysts may show a significant activity drop over time, when subjected to e.g. hydrothermal conditions as used in relation to the present invention. In order to minimize such potential activity loss a surface area stabilizer is incorporated intothe heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
