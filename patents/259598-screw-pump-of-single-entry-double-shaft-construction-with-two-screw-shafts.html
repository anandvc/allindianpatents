FIELD OF INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a screw pump of single entry, double shaft construction with two screw<br>
shafts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
From DE 715860 B1 a mixed-flow pump for pumped liquids is known that has a single-sided external<br>
bearing for the feed screws. The feed screws are enclosed by a housing embodied as one piece and<br>
flange-connected to a housing part in which the screw-shaped rotors are supported. This housing can be<br>
removed for servicing tasks. If the pump has to be serviced, it is necessary to take the pump out of the<br>
feed line at the inlet and outlet pipes and to install a completely new pump.<br>
Alternatively to a complete replacement, a screw pump can be dismantled and repaired on site, which is<br>
very time-consuming. Furthermore, a pump assembly from several components at the customer's<br>
location has the disadvantage that a pump test with a precise determination of the performance data is<br>
impossible, so that as a rule a complete pump replacement is necessary to meet the required<br>
performance parameters.<br>
Especially with single-well boosting there are high fluctuations in the composition of the medium to be<br>
pumped. States of pumping 100% liquid and phase of pumping 100% gas alternate in a largely<br>
unpredictable manner, whereby the phases of pumping 100% gas are particularly critical for screw<br>
pumps, since with conventional screw pumps the sealing, cooling and lubricating liquid is removed after<br>
a certain time of gas pumping. This state causes a heating of the feed screws and, associated therewith,<br>
a contact of the feed screws with one another and with the feed housing, which causes a higher wear,<br>
possibly a stoppage of the pump. The problems thus arising in terms of servicing on site have already<br>
been described.<br>
EP 0 405 160 A1 describes a screw pump with a drive shaft arranged in the internal chamber of a pump<br>
housing and at least one sealed spindle axially parallel thereto, as well as with an intake and an outlet for<br>
a flow medium to be pumped by the spindles.<br>
The spindles are enclosed by a tubular housing insert, which, together with the pump housing enveloping<br>
it, delimits at least one annular space connected to the internal chamber accommodating the spindles by<br>
at least one through hole.<br><br><br>
In addition to screw pumps, eccentric screw pumps are also used for single-well boosting, but<br>
these eccentric screw pumps are suitable only to a limited extent for pumping multiphase<br>
mixtures, as their capability of pumping 100% gas is very limited in terms of time because of<br>
the friction heat being produced.<br>
As a result of the oversizing of multi-phase pumps in a double-shaft, double-entry embodiment<br>
and for lack of suitable multi-phase pumps with lower output, thousands of oil wells all over the<br>
world are not or no longer worked, which means that valuable raw materials are not being used.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a pump that can be produced and<br>
serviced in a cost-effective manner and is basically suitable for pumping multi-phase mixtures<br>
within the scope of single-well boosting.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig.1	shows a screw pump with two screw shafts in cross-sectional view.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The screw pump according to the invention in single-entry, double-shaft construction with an<br>
external bearing of the two screw shafts and a pump housing enclosing the screw shafts by<br>
forming feed chambers and externally delimiting the feed chambers with its internal shell<br>
surface, as well as an induction chamber for the medium to be induced and a pressure chamber<br>
to accommodate the medium pumped by the screw shafts, provides that the pump housing is<br>
inserted into a pressure housing and attached to the pressure housing, so that the pressure<br>
chamber enclose the pump housing at least in part. Since the pump housing can be inserted<br>
into the pressure housing and since the pump housing is attached to the pressure housing, it is<br>
possible to exchange merely the pump housing together with the screw shafts arranged therein<br>
and with the external bearing, so that a screw pump is provided in modular construction, which<br>
pump can be repaired quickly because the wearing parts can be removed completely from the<br>
pressure housing. A simple exchange of the pump housing with the screw shafts arranged<br>
therein furthermore<br><br><br>
results in a mechanical decoupling of the pressure housing and the pump housing, so that<br>
deformations caused by pressure within the pressure housing are not transferred to the<br>
pump housing at all or are transferred merely to an imperceptible extent. The position<br>
accuracy of the screw shafts to one another thus remains ensured, since the deformations<br>
of the pressure housing have no effect on the tolerances of the feed elements, seals and<br>
bearings. This reduces wear and allows the adjustment of a narrow gap size, which<br>
increases the efficiency of the pump. With a use in single-well boosting it is provided for<br>
reasons of compression to provide separation devices in the pressure chamber to separate<br>
a pumped multi-phase mixture into a gas phase and a liquid phase, so that either the<br>
separated phases can be discharged separately or a part of the separated liquid phase can<br>
be guided back from the pressure chamber to the induction chamber via a short-circuited<br>
line, in order to provide a minimum amount of liquid within the pump housing, so that<br>
the screw shafts can be cooled and the gap between the screw shafts and between the<br>
screw shafts and the pump housing can be sealed.<br>
A further development of the invention provides that the pump housing extends through<br>
the pressure housing, so that the pump housing has two mating points or end bearing<br>
points in the pressure housing. It is thereby provided for the pump housing to be<br>
attached, in particular screwed, to the pressure housing only on one side, whereas the end<br>
of the pump housing not attached to the pressure housing is supported in a guideway in<br>
the pressure housing.<br>
It is thus rendered possible for the pump housing to be supported in the pressure housing<br>
in a fixed manner on one side and in an easily moveable manner on the other side,<br>
whereby the slight clearance between the pressure housing and the pump housing is<br>
sealed by at least one seal, so that no medium to be pumped can leak from the pressure<br>
chamber through gaps in the guideway. The slight clearance within the guideway in the<br>
pressure housing ensures that the pressure prevailing in the pressure chamber does not<br>
cause any deformations within the pump housing, which deformations might alter the<br>
clearance among the screw shafts and between the screw shafts and the pump housing, so<br>
that the pump housing as a whole is slightly displaced within the pressure housing.<br><br>
A further advantage of the embodiment according to the invention is the simpler<br>
manufacture of the pressure housing because of the lower demands on the position<br>
accuracy of the components, so that the pressure housing can be produced in a more cost-<br>
effective manner. Furthermore, servicing is considerably simplified because of the<br>
complete removability of the pump housing together with the screw shafts and the<br>
bearing unit.<br>
In order to achieve the stiffest construction possible despite the simple structure, it is<br>
provided to attach the pump housing to the pressure housing via a base plate. Both the<br>
pressure housing and the pump housing are thus attached to the base plate, and possibly<br>
also the bearing unit in which the screw shafts are supported separated from the pumped<br>
flow. The screw shafts are supported in the bearing unit, which is in turn connected to<br>
the pump housing, so that the bearing unit can be removed completely from the pressure<br>
housing together with the pump housing and the screw shafts. The screw shafts, the<br>
pump housing and the bearing unit of the screw shafts can thus be combined to form a<br>
feed module that can be exchanged easily and subjected to a complete performance test<br>
after manufacture, so that it is possible to predict the performance parameters of the<br>
pump when the feed module is exchanged for a new or overhauled feed module.<br>
Since the pump housing is located within the pressure housing, it is possible to embody<br>
the short-circuited line within the pump housing, thus to produce a direct connection<br>
between the pump chamber and the induction chamber.<br>
The short-circuited line guides separated liquid phase back into the induction chamber in<br>
a metered manner, which entails losses in the efficiency of the pump, but renders possible<br>
a greatly extended service life when the screw pump is used to pump multi-phase<br>
mixtures.<br>
The pump housing can be arranged off-center in the pressure housing, on the one hand, in<br>
order to facilitate the separation and the return of the separated liquid phase to the<br><br>
induction side of the screw shafts through a short-circuited line and, on the other hand, to<br>
prevent an effect of the pressure-dependent deformations of the pressure housing on the<br>
bearing unit or on the screw shafts, or to cause this effect to produce an angular<br>
deformation of the bearing unit that counteracts a pressure-dependent deflection of the<br>
screw shafts. <br>
In addition, tie rods can be arranged in the pressure housing to prestress the pressure<br>
housing with respect to the screw shaft bearing, so that a pressure-dependent angular<br>
deformation of the bearing unit can be adjusted alternatively or in addition to a suitable<br>
positioning of the pump housing in the pressure housing and to the selection of the wall<br>
thickness and/or the use of materials.<br>
In a further integration of functions into the feed module it is provided for the induction<br>
chamber to be embodied in the pump housing, so that the induction chamber can be<br>
optimally adapted to the feed screws in terms of sizing and flow technology design.<br>
In order to simplify the embodiment of the pressure housing it is provided for the pump<br>
housing to form a part of the wall of the pressure chamber, i.e., for the insert of the pump<br>
housing to form a part of the interior wall of the pressure chamber. This requires the<br>
pump housing to be attached to the pressure housing in a sealed manner, whereby<br>
passages or flow channels for the pumped medium are provided, through which the<br>
pumped medium is guided into the pressure chamber.<br>
Connecting devices for supply lines or discharge lines are also embodied on the pressure<br>
housing, so that the pressure housing does not have to be removed from the line network<br>
when the pump is serviced, which makes it possible to prevent a considerable assembly<br>
expenditure and to avoid seal-tightness problems from installing complete pumps in or<br>
removing them from the line network.<br><br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained below on the basis of figure 1<br>
representing a screw pump in cross-sectional view.<br>
Figure 1 shows a single-entry screw pump with two screw shafts 1, 2, which are composed of<br>
shafts 10, 20 coupled to one another by means of gear wheels, and rotors 11, 12 attached<br>
thereto via screws. The shafts 10, 20 are supported in a bearing housing 19 and form a bearing<br>
unit 9 sealed with respect to the medium to be pumped. The rotors 11, 12 are supported in a<br>
pump housing 3, with the shell inner surface 3a of the pump housing 3 enclosing the rotors 11,<br>
12 so that feed chambers 4 are formed through the rotors 11, 12 meshing with one another in<br>
conjunction with the shell surface 3a, in which feed chambers the medium to be pumped is<br>
pumped via connecting channels 16 from an induction chamber 5 into a pressure chamber 6.<br>
There is a minimum clearance between the rotors 11, 12 as well as between the rotors 11, 12<br>
and the shell surface 3a, in order to keep the leak rate of the pump to a minimum.<br>
The pressure chamber 6, here embodied as an annular space, is formed by a pressure housing 7<br>
that delimits the pressure chamber 6 respectively on the face side on the exterior circumference.<br>
The inner delimitation of the pressure chamber 6 is realized via the exterior wall of the pump<br>
housing 3, since the pump housing 3 extends through the pressure housing 7 and thus through<br>
the pressure chamber 6. The pump housing 3 is attached to a base plate 8 by means of studs<br>
40, to which base plate the bearing unit 9 is also attached by means of studs 41. The base plate<br>
8 is in turn coupled to the pressure housing 7 via tie rods 42, so that the pump housing 3 is<br>
attached on one side to the pump housing 7 via the studs 40, the base plate 8 and the tie rods<br>
42. In the area of the studs 40 the pump housing 3 is provided with an annular flange 37 that<br>
can be inserted into a correspondingly embodied recess 27 of the pump housing 7. The end 30<br>
of the pump housing 3 facing away from the base plate 8 is supported in a recess 17 of the<br>
pump housing 7; it is not screw-connected there, however, but only sealed via a seal 27. On the<br>
face side, a further seal is sealed via the faceplate 15 that has a through hole 25 to introduce<br>
the pumped medium into the induction chamber 5. Screw threads 26 are also provided to<br>
receive connecting means or supply lines in the faceplate 15.<br><br><br>
The one-sided support of the pump housing 3 on the pressure housing 7 has the advantage that the<br>
 combination, structured in a modular manner, of pump housing 3, bearing unit 9 and the feed<br>
screws 1,2 arranged therein is decoupled from the compression strains of the pressure housing 7.<br>
The pressure housing 7 can be designed for the respective system design pressure and can basically<br>
be embodied as large as desired, whereby merely the recesses 17, 27 and the connecting devices<br>
must be embodied such that the respective feed units or feed modules composed of pump housing<br>
3 and bearing unit 9 can be mounted.<br>
The pump is completed by inserting the feed unit into the pressure housing 7, with the pump<br>
housing 3 integrated into the feed unit simultaneously forming the induction chamber 5 and<br>
ensuring the separation of induction chamber 5 from pressure chamber 6.<br>
Furthermore, flanges 14 are provided on the pressure housing 7 for the discharge lines, which can<br>
remain installed in a fixed manner.<br>
Separation devices can be provided in the pressure chamber 6 for the separation of gas phase and<br>
liquid phase when multi-phase mixtures are pumped. These devices can be baffle plates or<br>
settling zones for producing a flow speed close to zero, with a short-circuited line 13, connecting<br>
the induction chamber 5 to the pressure chamber 6, preferentially being provided at points of this<br>
type. In the embodiment shown, the short-circuited line 13 is embodied in the pump housing 3 and<br>
arranged on the bottom side, so that liquid located in the lower part of the annular pressure<br>
chamber 6, which liquid is filled up to the pressure housing 3, can be induced into the induction<br>
chamber 5 and moved through the rotors 11,12 there. This causes a heat transfer, a sealing and a<br>
lubrication of the rotors 11, 12. The embodiment shown is suitable in particular to ensure a safe<br>
functioning of the pump even with very different wellhead pressures, which can rise from quasi<br>
atmospheric pressures to over 100 bar.<br>
Pump protection filters can be integrated or arranged in the inlet opening 25 or before it, in order to<br>
hold back undesired particles and to prevent damage to the rotors 11,12.<br><br><br>
