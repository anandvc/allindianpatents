ALKYL SILICATE PAINT COMPOSITIONS WITH IMPROVED CRACKING<br>
RESISTANCE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate composition<br>
with improved cracking resistance. The present invention provides improved<br>
cracking resistance of such an acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate composition by<br>
incorporation of specific types of fibres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alkyl silicate coatings are used mainly as anti-corrosive primers on steel<br>
substrates due to outstanding corrosion resistance, superior mechanical<br>
properties, very high temperature resistance and excellent chemical resistance.<br>
Alkyl silicate coating compositions are typically one or two-component products.<br>
If the product is two-component, component one normally consists of a liquid<br>
mixture of the silicate binder, co-binders, anti-sagging agents and solvents and<br>
component two contains a metallic pigment, most often a metallic zinc pigment<br>
commonly referred to as zinc dust.<br>
Zinc silicates are superior to other linings concerning anticorrosive properties<br>
due to its function as a sacrificial anode applied directly on top of the clean steel<br>
surface. When the coating layer is damaged the zinc will protect the damage by<br>
galvanic protection. The function is similar to that of galvanized steel.<br>
Alkyl silicate binders are normally used as primer, i.e. first coating layer in a<br>
multiple coat system with subsequent layers of suitable generic types of coatings<br>
e.g. epoxy or polyurethane. However, silicate binders can also be used as one-<br>
coat systems or alternatively as topcoats<br>
 <br>
Alkyl silicates such as ethyl silicates are not reactive enough to be suitable for<br>
binder use without further hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of ethyl silicate can be<br>
either acid or base catalyzed. Acid catalysis generally proceeds in a somewhat<br>
slower and more controlled fashion. In addition, the presence of acids tends to<br>
stabilize reactive silanol (Si-OH) groups and increase storage stability. An<br>
overview of the issues of stability and reactivity for ethyl silicates is given in<br>
"The Use of Ethyl Silicate in Zinc Rich Paints", Steinmetz J.R., Modern Paint and<br>
Coatings, June 1983. If alkaline materials are introduced in the liquid part of an<br>
acidic-stabilised silicate binder, the liquid becomes neutral and the silanol groups<br>
become reactive and an instable liquid is formed.<br>
It is well known to the person skilled in the art that depending on the type of<br>
acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate binder and alkaline material introduced into the<br>
silicate binder, the stability in the liquid part could vary from no more than 6<br>
months stability to almost immediate gelling of the product.<br>
Examples of alkaline materials are fillers such as feldspar, talc, mica, dolomite,<br>
calcite, bauxite, or various types of silicate materials.<br>
In practise, the person skilled in the art will refrain from introducing alkaline<br>
materials in to the composition in order to secure storage stability. The person<br>
skilled in the art will select ingredients among materials giving a pH in the<br>
neutral area or a pH below 7 when suspended or dissolved in water.<br>
Acidic stabilised alkyl silicate coatings are easy to apply with standard spraying<br>
equipment. However, spraying a silicate paint composition is a little different<br>
from conventional paints. Normally, paints have a tendency to build up in<br>
corners on welding seams and in difficult accessible areas, a problem which is<br>
even more pronounced if the silicate paint composition contains a metallic<br>
pigment e.g. zinc. These products are formulated with PVC above the CPVC ratio<br>
to ensure sufficient contact between the zinc particles for galvanic protection.<br>
Silicate coatings with metallic pigment will therefore have a higher risk for mud<br>
cracking if they are applied in too high film thickness. Consequently, extra<br>
 <br>
efforts and man hours are often spent here in order not to end up with too high<br>
dry film thicknesses.<br>
Existing silicate products are specified in a total dry film thickness of 40 to<br>
125 urn, typically 75 Mm, but it is unavoidable to get overlaps and high dry film<br>
thickness in comers and edges. Especially in association with the interior of the<br>
angles formed between the structural elements there is a risk of getting far<br>
higher dry film thicknesses than specified. Often it is necessary to go after with<br>
brushes on the critical areas in order to avoid mud-cracking. Removing excess<br>
paint manually by brush is time consuming and not the ideal solution but the<br>
alternative is worse: Too high coating thickness, often exceeding normal<br>
acceptance limits, causes high curing shrinkage stress and may cause mud-<br>
cracking.<br>
When the silicate paint composition is applied in too high film thickness, mud<br>
cracking appears. This happens when the narrowly defined correlation between<br>
the applied film thickness, the drying process, and the curing is "out of balance".<br>
In the past asbestos fibres and fibrous calcium silicate have been used in zinc<br>
alkyl silicate compositions (US 3,056,684).<br>
In recent years faster curing products have appeared comprising accelerators<br>
such as zinc chloride or magnesium chloride. Fast curing lowers the overall<br>
processing time which has become a very important parameter for paint<br>
applicators and contractors. However it has only been possible to increase curing<br>
up to a certain level as the fast curing has a negative impact on the cracking<br>
level (internal stress). The amount of zinc chloride that can be added is<br>
therefore limited.<br>
The curing process starts on the surface of the coating. When curing is too fast<br>
the soft uncured part of the coating will not have sufficient strength to "carry"<br>
the stress built up during curing and mud cracks will develop on the surface<br>
leading to subsequent loss of adhesion, cohesion and corrosion problems<br>
 <br>
There is a need for a storage stable, acid catalysed alkyI silicate with increased<br>
flexibility, enabling faster processing without mud cracking.<br>
It has now surprisingly been discovered that it is possible to incorporate<br>
substantial amounts of alkaline fibres into acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate<br>
composition without any stability problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a storage stable, acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate<br>
composition with increased flexibility, enabling faster processing without mud<br>
cracking.<br>
This being said, the present invention provides an acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate<br>
composition comprising 0.5-30% by solids volume of inorganic fibres,<br>
said fibres having<br>
(i) an average length of 25-250 urn and an average thickness of 1-50 urn,<br>
and a ratio between the average length and the average thickness<br>
(aspect ratio) of at least 5; and<br>
(ii) a specific surface area (BET) of 0.01-6 m2/g-<br>
The present invention further provides an acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate<br>
composition comprising zinc and inorganic fibres, the zinc constituting 50-95 %<br>
by solids weight of the total composition, and the fibres constituting 1-30% by<br>
solids volume of the non-zinc fraction of the composition,<br>
said fibres having<br>
(i) an average length of 25-250 µm and an average thickness of 1-50 µm,<br>
and a ratio between the average length and the average thickness<br>
(aspect ratio) of at least 5; and<br>
 <br>
(ii) a specific surface area (BET) of 0.01-6 m2/g.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a method for the establishment of a<br>
crack resistant alkyl silicate paint coat, said method comprising the step of<br>
applying a paint composition as defined herein to a metal surface.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, the present invention - in a first main aspect - provides an<br>
acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate composition comprising 0.5-30% by solids volume<br>
of inorganic fibres, said fibres having<br>
(i) an average length of 25-250 µm and an average thickness of 1-50 µm,<br>
and a ratio between the average length and the average thickness<br>
(aspect ratio) of at least 5; and<br>
(ii) a specific surface area (BET) of 0.01-6 m2/g.<br>
It has been found that by applying the principles of the present invention, the<br>
narrow correlation between mud cracking level and dry film thickness for an<br>
alkyl silicate coating can actually become very wide by incorporating fibres.<br>
Fibres will when incorporated in the alkyl silicate resin matrix increase the ability<br>
to withstand higher mechanical stress. This facilitates the possibility to formulate<br>
alkyl silicate compositions with faster curing and higher mud crack resistance at<br>
the same time.<br>
It should be understood that in one main embodiment, the alkyl silicate<br>
composition may be used as a component of a two-component system (or a<br>
system comprising more than two components), e.g. where another component<br>
may contain zinc (see further below). In a second main embodiment, the alkyl<br>
silicate composition may be used as a coating composition in its own right, e.g.<br>
without the inclusion zinc.<br>
 <br>
Alkyl silicate<br>
The term "alkyl silicate composition" should be construed as the combination of<br>
- as the principal constituents - one or more alkyl silicate resins, any catalysts<br>
and any accelerators, and in addition hereto, in the context of the present<br>
invention, fibres. The compositions may further included other constituents, e.g.,<br>
as it will be explained further below.<br>
The term "acidic-stabilised" is intended to mean that the silicate is partially<br>
hydrolysed by means of water and by utilizing an acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid) as a catalyst. Acid catalysis generally proceeds in a somewhat<br>
slower and more controlled fashion compared to partial hydrolysis by using a<br>
base as the catalyst. In addition, the presence of acids tends to stabilize reactive<br>
silanol (Si-OH) groups and increase storage stability. The compositions<br>
discussed herein are all "acidic-stabilised" for what reason they are simply<br>
referred to as "alkyl silicate compositions".<br>
Besides the fact that the alkyl silicate composition should preferably facilitate<br>
fast curing, it is also relevant that the alkyl silicate coat resulting from the<br>
application of the alkyl silicate composition (either by direct application or after<br>
admixture with another component, e.g. a zinc-containing component) is<br>
somewhat flexible.<br>
The alkyl silicate composition comprises one or more alkyl silicate resins.<br>
Suitable alkyl silicate resins include ethyl silicates although other alkyl silicates,<br>
wherein the alkyl groups contained from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as methyl<br>
silicates, propyl silicates, butyl silicates, hexyl silicates and octyl silicates can<br>
also be employed, either alone or in admixture. The alkyl silicate resins used can<br>
suitably be hydrolysed to various degrees.<br>
Examples of suitable commercially available alkyl silicate resins are:<br>
Dynasylan 40, ex. Degussa (Germany), ethyl silicate<br>
 <br>
Silikat TES 40 WN, ex. Wacker Chemie (Germany), ethyl silicate<br>
Silbond 40, ex. Silbond Corporation (USA), ethyl silicate<br>
Silikat TES 28, ex. Wacker Chemie (Germany), ethyl silicate<br>
Ethyl silicate has been the dominant alkyl silicate resin for more than 30 years.<br>
Other alkyl types have been used such as isopropyl and butyl from which the<br>
corresponding alcohol is evolved on hydrolysis, but ethyl, despite of the low<br>
flash point of 10°C of ethanol, is the principal type used. Ethanol is completely<br>
miscible with water, ideal for hydrolysis and has low toxicity (G J. Biddle,<br>
Inorganic zinc silicate coatings). Moreover, curing speed is faster than with<br>
higher alcohols.<br>
The starting point for ethyl silicate (relevant illustrative example of an alkyl<br>
silicate) is tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS), a monomeric product with a<br>
composition of (C2H5O)4Si. The raw material normally used by paint<br>
manufacturers is a polyethyl silicate containing about 40% silica. Normal<br>
procedure is to partially hydrolyse the polyethyl silicate during production by<br>
addition of water and a small amount of catalyst, e.g. hydrochloric acid to speed<br>
up the curing of the coating after application. Upon partial hydrolysis, some of<br>
the ethoxy groups in the ethyl ortho silicate are replaced by hydroxyl groups,<br>
thereby liberating ethanol. Some of the hydroxyl groups react with each other,<br>
giving off water and tying silicon atoms together by oxygen bridges. The<br>
condensation reaction is slow in acidic environments. The amounts of water and<br>
catalyst are carefully calculated and controlled to optimise the balance between<br>
shelf life, mixed pot life, curing and cracking level.<br>
Preferably, the degree of pre-hydrolysis of the alkyl silicate resin is more than<br>
50 %, such as 60-95 %, e.g. 75-90 %.<br>
If the alkyl silicate composition is mixed with zinc (see also further below), the<br>
resulting paint composition becomes pH-neutral. The condensation reaction will<br>
 <br>
become active and the alkyl resin silicate will begin to polymerize. After<br>
application, humidity in the air completes the polymerisation<br>
A common way to reduce the curing time is to add an accelerator such as zinc<br>
chloride or magnesium chloride. The maximum amount of zinc chloride that can<br>
be added is limited as the fast curing has a negative impact on the cracking level<br>
(internal stress). By adding fibres to the alkyl silicate resin, the negative impact<br>
on the cracking level can be diminished and it is possible to add higher amounts<br>
of accelerator thereby reducing the curing time even further than previously<br>
possible.<br>
If an alkyl silicate resin is not fully cured, its abrasion resistance and the<br>
adhesion to subsequent paint layers are reduced.<br>
The alkyl silicate composition comprises one or more catalysts. Suitable<br>
catalysts are believed to include hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid.<br>
The alkyl silicate composition may further comprise one or more accelerators<br>
selected from zinc chloride, magnesium chloride or borate types like<br>
trimethylborate.<br>
Examples of suitable commercially available accelerators are:<br>
Zinc Chloride, ex. Barcelonesa de Droguas y Producto Qui'micos (Spain),<br>
anhydrous zinc chloride<br>
Magnesium chloride (CAS no. 7786-30-3), ex Merck (Germany), anhydrous<br>
magnesium chloride<br>
Silbond TMB 70, ex. Silbond Corporation (USA), trimethylborate.<br>
The accelerators - when present - typically constitutes 0.1:100 to 50:100, e.g.<br>
0.5:100 to 20:100, such as 1:100 to 10:100 or 2:100 to 6:100 relative to the<br>
alkyl silicate resin.<br>
 <br>
Inorganic Fibres<br>
Another important constituent of the alkyl silicate composition is the inorganic<br>
fibres.<br>
Inorganic fibres encompass natural inorganic fibres and synthetic inorganic<br>
fibres, in particular mineral fibres of these types, such as volcanic rock fibres,<br>
are especially preferred.<br>
By "mineral fibres" should be understood fibres made using minerals as starting<br>
materials. According to this definition "mineral fibre" includes both crystalline<br>
materials and amorphous materials formed by a melting process.<br>
It is presently believed that the fibres to be used within the present invention<br>
should fulfil certain criteria with respect to dimensions and surface<br>
characteristics in order to provide the improved properties of the resulting paint<br>
compositions. Thus, with respect to average length and average thickness of the<br>
fibres which are added to the paint during manufacture of the paint or mixed<br>
with the paint before application, such fibres have an average length of 25-250<br>
µm and an average thickness of 1-50 µm, and a ratio between the average<br>
length and the average thickness (aspect ratio) of at least 5.<br>
In the present invention preferred inorganic fibres are inorganic fibres having an<br>
average thickness of 1-25 µm and an average length of 25-250 urn, in<br>
particularly an average length of 50-250 µm (such as 50-170 urn) and an<br>
average thickness of 2-20 urn (such as 2-10 µm). The preferred inorganic fibres<br>
furthermore have a ratio between the average length and the average thickness<br>
(aspect ratio) of at least 5, preferably a ratio between the average length and<br>
the average thickness of at least 10, in particularly at least 15, such as at least<br>
20.<br>
For the purpose of the manufacture, it is furthermore preferred that the length<br>
of the fibres are held within a certain threshold value, e.g. a maximum length of<br>
500 µm, so that conventional spraying equipment can be used with only minor<br>
 <br>
modifications. In particular, it is preferred that the maximum length of the fibres<br>
is at the most 400 urn, e.g. at the most 350 µm.<br>
It should be noted that the term "length" refers to the greatest dimension of the<br>
fibre particle in question. The term "average" when used in connection with<br>
length indicates that a certain variation of the length of fibres exists within the<br>
distribution of the fibres used. The term "average thickness" also refers to the<br>
fibres in question, however with regard to the distribution of fibres also taking<br>
into account the longitudinal and cross-sectional variation with each individual<br>
fibre.<br>
In order for a certain particle to be considered as a fibre within the present<br>
context, the ratio between the greatest dimension and the smallest dimension<br>
perpendicular to the length dimension in substantially all points along the<br>
longitudinal axis (the length dimension - longest dimension) should not exceed<br>
2.5:1, preferably not exceed 2:1. Furthermore, the ratio between the longest<br>
dimension and the second smallest of the two shortest dimensions should be at<br>
least 2:1, preferably at least 5:1. Thus, fibres are characterised of having one<br>
long dimension and two short dimension, where the long dimension is longer<br>
than the two short dimensions (typically by an order of magnitude, or even<br>
more), and the two short dimensions are substantially equal (of the same order<br>
of magnitude). For completely regular fibres, i.e. fibres having a cylindrical<br>
shape, it is evident how to determine the "length" (longest dimension) and the<br>
two (identical) shortest dimensions. For more irregular fibres, it is believed that<br>
the relationship between the dimensions can be evaluated by the following<br>
hypothetical experiment: A regular, right-angled box is constructed around the<br>
fibre. The box is constructed so as to have the smallest possible volume as it<br>
should fully comprise the fibre. To the extent that the fibre is curved, it is (again<br>
hypothetically) assumed that the fibre is flexible so that the volume of the<br>
hypothetical box can be minimised by "straightening" the fibre. In order for the<br>
"fibre" to be recognised as so in the present context, the ratio between the two<br>
smallest dimensions of the box should be at the most 2.5:1 (preferably 2:1) and<br>
the ratio between the longest dimension of the box and the second smallest of<br>
the two smallest dimensions of the box should be at least 5:1.<br>
 <br>
The above is given as a general guideline in order to exclude other types of<br>
particles which may be referred to as "fibres" but which do have less satisfactory<br>
properties within the present invention. In particular, the term "fibre" is not<br>
intended to include so-called inorganic "fibre" materials which are used as fillers<br>
(e.g. frayed type fillers with no well defined dimensions such as asbestine<br>
(asbestine typically have a specific surface area (BET) of around 50 m2/g)), cf.<br>
Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 11th Ed., (Sax and Lewis, eds.), Van<br>
Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, 1987, page 521. Neither does "fibre"<br>
include flake type fillers, e.g. mica, flake shaped clay minerals, aluminium flakes<br>
nor glass flakes cf. the definition above. With respect to "curved" fibres, it<br>
should be understood that the length dimension should be considered as the<br>
length along the curve defined by the fibre.<br>
Without being bound to any specific theory, it is also envisioned that the specific<br>
surface area (BET) of the fibre is important. The specific surface area of the<br>
fibres used is typically 0.01-6 m2/g, such as 0.05-6 m2/g, preferably 0.05-5<br>
m2/g, or 0.05-4.0 m2/g, or 0.1-2 m2/g.<br>
Without being bound to any specific theory, it is presently believed that the<br>
fibres used in the present invention should have, when measured according to<br>
"Measurement of pH" as described in the "Experimentals" section, a pH value<br>
between 7.0-12.0, such as 7.5-11.5. Especially relevant pH-value of the fibres<br>
may be 8.0-11.0, such as 8.5-10.5, or 8.5-10.0, or 8.5-9.5, or 9.0-10.5, or 9.0-<br>
10.0.<br>
The surface of the fibres may or may not have been modified (surface treated)<br>
by chemical or physical processes. Examples of such modification processes<br>
used to improve the beneficial effects of the fibres are carbonisation; silylation;<br>
surface oxidation; etching such as treatment with alkali metal hydroxide,<br>
treatment with hydrofluoric acid; coating; poly electrolytic entrapment in the<br>
porous surface structures; adsorption processes; hydrogen-bonding processes;<br>
cationic bonding processes; esterification; anionic bonding processes; etc. as<br>
well as any modification processes included in the manufacturing of the fibres.<br>
 <br>
In an interesting embodiment the fibres to be incorporated in the paints are<br>
biodegradable under physiological conditions, especially in the respiratory<br>
organs (the lungs) of mammals, especially humans. Thus, it is believed that<br>
especially interesting fibres are those which are able to biodegrade when present<br>
in a modified Gamble's solution as defined in WO 96/14454, page 9. The degree<br>
of biodegradability should preferably be at least 20 nm/day, such as at least 30<br>
nm/day, in particular at least 50 nm/day when tested as described in WO<br>
96/14454. Examples of suitable biodegradable fibres are the ones described in<br>
WO 96/14454 and WO 96/14274. A specific example thereof is the commercially<br>
available MS 603 Roxul 1000, ex. Lapinus Fibres BV (see below). The<br>
biodegradability is especially relevant for mineral fibres.<br>
The fibres may, as it will be clear from the description of the manufacturing<br>
processes further below, be added together with the remaining paint<br>
constituents before milling or the fibres may be added afterwards. It can<br>
however be expected that the average length of the fibres will be somewhat<br>
reduced during the paint manufacture process (see further below), e.g. due to<br>
the applied shear forces and/or milling process. (Milling and intensive stirring is<br>
typically performed in order to break up agglomerates of pigments and other<br>
particles in the paint composition). It is believed that the paint manufacturing<br>
process should preferably be performed so that the fibres in the ready-to-use<br>
paint have an average length corresponding to at least 75% of the<br>
pre-manufacture average length.<br>
The concentration of the fibres is normally in the range of 0.5-30 %, such as 1-<br>
25 % or 2-30 %, e.g. 2-20 % or 5-25 %, or 3-18 %, or 4-12 %, preferably 5-10<br>
%, by solids volume of the composition.<br>
For the embodiments, wherein the alkyl silicate composition is to be used as<br>
such for coating a surface, the content of the inorganic fibres may be somewhat<br>
higher, such as 2-50 %, e.g. 4-40 %, or 5-35 % or 2-30 %, and preferably 5-25<br>
% or 10-30 %, by solids volume of the composition.<br>
 <br>
It should be understood that the above ranges refer to the total amount of<br>
fibres, thus, in the case where two or more fibre types are utilised, the combined<br>
amounts should fall within the above ranges.<br>
It is presently believed that one very interesting group of fibres is mineral fibres.<br>
Particularly preferred examples of such fibres are silicon-containing fibres,<br>
rockwool fibres, processed mineral fibres from mineral wool, and volcanic rock<br>
fibres.<br>
An average chemical composition of a group of preferred fibres is (only main<br>
constituents mentioned as the corresponding oxides): a silicium (SiO2) content<br>
of 30-60 %w/w, a combined calcium (CaO) and magnesium (MgO) content of<br>
20-50 %w/w, an aluminium (Al2O3) content of 0.1-30 %w/w, an iron<br>
(Fe2O3/FeO) content of up to 10 %w/w, and a combined potassium (K2O) and<br>
sodium (Na2O) content of below 8 %w/w. Up to 5 %w/w of other constituents<br>
may be present in the inorganic fibres.<br>
Even more preferred fibres have an average chemical composition: a silicium<br>
(SiO2) content of 35-45 %w/w, a combined calcium (CaO) and magnesium<br>
(MgO) content of 30-40 %w/w, an aluminium (Al2O3) content of 15-25 %w/w,<br>
an iron (Fe2O3/FeO) content of 0-3 %w/w, and a combined potassium (K2O) and<br>
sodium (Na2O) content of below 6 %w/w. Up to 3 %w/w of other constituents<br>
may be present in the inorganic fibres.<br>
Examples of commercially available mineral fibres which are believed to improve<br>
the mechanical properties according to the invention are (average fibre length in<br>
µm; average fibre thickness in |xm):<br>
1.	Coatforce CF10, ex. Lapinus Fibres BV (The Netherlands), (125;5.5)<br>
2.	MS 603 Roxul 1000, ex. Lapinus Fibres BV (The Netherlands), volcanic rock<br>
fibre (125;5)<br>
 <br>
3. MS 610 Roxul 1000, ex. Lapinus Fibres BV (The Netherlands), volcanic rock<br>
fibre (225;5.5).<br>
With respect to the relation between the fibres and the alkyl silicate resin, the<br>
weight ratio of said fibres to the alkyl silicate resin is typically at least 20:100,<br>
such as 20:100-75:100, e.g. 25:100-70:100.<br>
Other constituents<br>
The paint composition may comprise other paint constituents as will be apparent<br>
for the person skilled in the art. Examples of such paint constituents are<br>
pigments, fillers, additives (e.g. thickening agents, wetting agents, suspending<br>
agents, anti-sag agents, anti-sediment agents, stabilizers, coalescing agents,<br>
and thixothropic agents.<br>
The paint composition typically comprises a solvent or solvents. Examples of<br>
solvents are alcohols such as water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>
butanol, isobutanol and benzyl alcohol; alcohol/water mixtures such as<br>
ethanol/water mixtures; aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
such as white spirit, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene and naphtha solvent; ketones<br>
such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl<br>
ketone, diacetone alcohol and cyclohexanone; ether alcohols such as 1-<br>
methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol and butyl diglycol; esters such as<br>
methoxypropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate; and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Preparation of the alkyl silicate composition<br>
The alkyl silicate composition may be prepared by any suitable technique that is<br>
commonly used within the field of paint production.<br>
 <br>

an acidic-stabilised alkyl silicate composition comprising zinc and inorganic<br>
fibres, the zinc constituting 50-95 % by solids weight of the total composition,<br>
and the fibres constituting 1-30% by solids volume of the non-zinc fraction of<br>
the composition,<br>
said fibres having<br>
(i) an average length of 25-250 µm and an average thickness of 1-50 µm,<br>
and a ratio between the average length and the average thickness<br>

follow that concerning the first main aspect of the invention (e.g. with respect to<br>
the alkyl silicate resin, the inorganic fibres, etc.).<br>
The zinc to be used is typically in a particulate form, e.g. in the form of zinc<br>
powder or zinc dust.<br>
This being said, the concentration of the fibres is normally in the range of 0.5-30<br>

solids volume of the non-zinc fraction of the composition.<br>
 <br>
Preparation of the zinc-containing alkyl silicate composition<br>
The zinc-containing alkyl silicate composition is typically prepared by mixing the<br>
alkyl silicate composition with zinc and any other relevant constituents shortly<br>
before use thereof. The constituents are typically prepared on beforehand as two<br>
(or more) components (pre-mixtures), which can readily be mixed so as to<br>
obtain the ready-to-used composition.<br>

 <br>
EXPERIMENTALS<br>
Test Methods<br>
Measurement of specific surface area<br>
The specific surface area is determined based on the conventional BET method.<br>
Measurement of pH<br>
The procedure is adjusted from ISO 787-8:2000: "General methods of test for<br>
pigments and extenders - Part 8: Determination of matter soluble in water -<br>
Cold extraction method".<br>
1.	Place 25 ±0.01 g of fibre/filler/pigment into a 250 mL beaker. Add 100 mL of<br>
deionised water to the beaker and stir at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) for one<br>
hour using a magnetic stirrer.<br>
2.	After stirring, let the mixture stand for 15 min and place then the supernatant<br>
into a centrifuge tube. Spin for 15 min at 3500 rpm.<br>
3.	Take the supernatant out using a pipette and filter with a 50 mL syringe<br>
equipped with a 0.45 urn cellulose filter. Place the filtrate in a small beaker (50<br>
mL).<br>
4.	Read the pH by using a pH-meter.<br>
Measurement of gel time<br>
The gel time indicates the degree of hydrolysis, and the degree of hydrolysis<br>
influences the storage stability and the curing time of the liquid. If the gel time<br>
is below the accepted limit, the shelf life of the product may be shorter than<br>
specified and this is not acceptable.<br>
 <br>
The gel time is measured on the component 1 liquid (prepared as described in<br>
"Preparation of component 1") but without adding the zinc chloride catalyst<br>
solution.<br>
The gel time is related to the temperature. The test must take place at a<br>
temperature of 25° C. Let the ingredients and the magnetic stirrer condition to<br>
25° C in a climatic room.<br>
1.	Weigh out in the cup the amount of sample to be tested that corresponds to<br>
15 mL by using the specific gravity of the sample.<br>
2.	Place the cup with the stirring rod and lid on a magnetic stirrer and start<br>
stirring at a speed of approx. 250-400 rpm.<br>
3.	Add 2.00 mL of 2.5 %w/w aqueous ammonium carbamate solution and start<br>
the stop watch. Continue rotation until the liquid gels. Stop the watch.<br>
The liquid may gel slowly; the gel time is then determined as the time when the<br>
vortex disappears and a curved surface is formed. The gel time is recorded when<br>
I)	the regularly swirling of the rod stops or<br>
II)	when the liquid is stiff though the stirring rod continues to swirl underneath.<br>
Stability test<br>
The stability test consists of accelerated exposure and measurement of gel time.<br>
The model paints were prepared according to the description in "Preparation of<br>
component 1". The model paints were kept in airtight glass containers and<br>
placed in a 50°C oven to speed up any processes causing instability in the<br>
container.<br>
 <br>
The containers were moved from the oven at regular intervals, left in the room<br>
for 2 hours for ambient temperature and measurement of the gel time was<br>
performed according to the instruction given in "Measurement of gel time"<br>
Mud-crack test (MCT) &amp; Accelerator test (ACT)<br>
Apply a coat on a steel panel, size 200 x 300 mm, with increasing film thickness<br>
with steps of 30-40 µm ranging from specified film thickness of the standard<br>
system up to 5 times the specified film thickness. Place the panels at 70-80%<br>
RH, 20-25°C. When the coat is completely cured, there must be no visual mud-<br>
cracking when looking through a magnifying glass with 10 times magnification.<br>
Pull-off test (POT)<br>
Pull-off test according to ISO 4624 (ASTM D 4541), with P.A.T hydraulic<br>
adhesion tester. This test covers the determination of the pull-off strength of a<br>
coating or coating system, by determining the greatest perpendicular force (in<br>
tension) that a surface area can bear, before a plug of material is detached.<br>
Failure will occur along the weakest plane within the system comprised of the<br>
test fixture, adhesive coating system and substrate. After the panels have been<br>
coated and conditioned, a steel pin doll with a surface area of 1.58 cm2 is glued<br>
onto the paint surface on the test panel (150x200x15mm) with Standard<br>
Araldite glue, cured for 24 hours. After curing of the glue, the paint film is cut<br>
free around the dolls down to the substrate and the dolls are pulled off using the<br>
P.A.T hydraulic adhesion tester. The pull-off value (tensile strength) is noted,<br>
and converted in relation to the area of the doll and stated in MPa.<br>
Salt Spray Test (SST)<br>
Salt spray test according to ASTM B 117 (ISO 7253). Test for evaluation<br>
corrosion resistance in salt spray or reproducing corrosion that occurs in<br>
atmosphere containing salt spray or splash. The test involves constant spray<br>
with a 5% NaCI solution at 35°C. When the test is stopped, blisters and rust are<br>
 <br>
evaluated according to ASTM D 714 (ISO 4628-2) and ASTM D 610 (ISO 4628-<br>
3) respectively. Adhesion is evaluated according to knife adhesion test.<br>
Chemical Resistance Test (CRT)<br>
Chemical resistance test (CRT), partly according to ISO 2812-1974 (method 1),<br>
which is a method for determining the resistance of a single-coat film or a multi-<br>
coat of paints or related products to the action of liquids.<br>
The panels are exposed to the liquid with inspection after 7 days, 1 month and<br>
final evaluation after 2 months. Panels are half immersed in the chemical and<br>
subject to storage temperatures of 23°C. After exposure, the panels are dried<br>
and both the immersed and non-immersed areas are tested according to ASTM<br>
D 4752 as follows:<br>
The method describes a solvent rub technique for assessing the MEK (methyl<br>
ethyl ketone) resistance of ethyl silicate (inorganic) zinc-rich primers.<br>
The dry film thickness of the coating in a selected area is measured. The coating<br>
is rubbed with MEK 50 times using a cloth. The dry film thickness in the rubbed<br>
area is measured after rubbing. The resistance is evaluated on a scale from 5<br>
(no effect on surface after rubbing) to 0 (penetration to the substrate after<br>
rubbing). Results from the immersed part are reported as wet resistance and the<br>
non-immersed area as dry resistance.<br>
Immersion (IMS)<br>
This test is performed in order to provoke possible weak adhesion in a system,<br>
applied on a panel half immersed in fresh water.<br>
The panel is applied and cured before the immersion. Half the panel is immersed<br>
in fresh water and half the panel is exposed to the water vapour. No water-<br>
stirring and ambient temperature. The exposure period is 14 days. When the<br>
 <br>
test is stopped, the panels are immediately examined for blisters according to<br>
ASTM D 714 (ISO 4628-2) and adhesion is evaluated according to knife adhesion<br>
test.<br>
Knife adhesion Test (ADH)<br>
Knife adhesion test is used to evaluate the adhesion of a paint system to the<br>
substrate and between coats (layers).<br>
The test is done by making two intersecting scratches through the paint film to<br>
the substrate with a sharp steel knife. Adhesive or cohesive failures are<br>
evaluated by peeling the coating from the intersection point and outwards.<br>
The test is performed on both immersed and non-immersed panel-halves<br>
(referred to as respectively "wet" and "dry" adhesion). The type of rupture is<br>
reported, and the severity is judged on a scale from 5 (perfect) to 0 (poor).<br>
Specific surface by nitrogen adsorption (BET)<br>
The specific surface area was measured by independent test institute.<br>
Measurements were made on a "Micromeritics Gemini III-2375", surface area<br>
analyzer -BET, where the specific surface of a product is measured by liquid<br>
nitrogen adsorption. Kaolinite from Micromeritics was used as reference.<br>
Materials<br>
All amounts stated as % by solids volume of the paint should be understood as<br>
% by solids volume of the mixed paint composition ready to be applied.<br>
The fibre and filler materials used are described in Table 1 below.<br>

environment, especially for maintenance purposes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Preparation of component 1<br>
Component 1 was prepared in the following way:<br>
Pre-hvdrolvsed ethyl silicate:<br>
Ethyl-silicate, l-methoxy-2-propanol, and isopropyl alcohol was mixed in a<br>
suitable can and the hydrochloric acid solution was added slowly under agitation<br>
for 1 hour.<br>
The intermediate base (xylene, pre-hydrolysed ethyl silicate, and additives) was<br>
pre-mixed on a Diaf dissolver equipped with an impeller disc (70 mm in<br>
diameter) in a 1 L can for 15 min at 1000 rpm. Fibre/filler (type and amounts as<br>
indicated in table 3) was added to the mixture and grinding was performed for 5<br>
min at 2000 rpm.<br>
The remaining l-methoxy-2-propanol and the C9 alkylbenzenes were added and<br>
the composition was mixed at 1000 rpm for 15 min. The zinc chloride catalyst<br>
solution was added and the composition was mixed for 5 min at 1000 rpm.<br>
The stability test was performed on model paints 4-12 and only on component 1<br>
of the model paint (before mixing component 1 and component 2)<br>
The remaining tests were performed on model paints 1-4 and commercial<br>
standard paint systems and on the mixed product of component 1 and<br>
component 2 of the model paints: Just before application, HEMPELS ZINC METAL<br>
PIGMENT 97170 (component 2) was added to component 1. HEMPEL'S ZINC<br>
METAL PIGMENT 97170 was slowly poured down into component 1 with constant<br>
mechanical stirring until the mixture was free of lumps.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Preparation of test panels<br>
Where not specifically stated elsewhere, the test panels used were coated<br>
according to the procedure stated below.<br>
Steel panels were coated with 60-120 urn dry film thickness (specific dry film<br>
thickness stated in the result schemes) of the paint to be tested by airless<br>
spraying with a recoat interval of 24 hours between each coat if more than one<br>
layer is applied. The steel panels used are all cold rolled mild steel, abrasive<br>
blasted to Sa 3 (ISO 8501-1), with a surface profile equivalent to BN 10<br>
(Rugotest No. 3). After the panels have been coated they are conditioned at a<br>
temperature of 20-25°C and 70-80% relative humidity for a period of 7 days if<br>
not otherwise stated.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Remarks to results: The stability test shows the correlation between the pH of<br>
the filler or fibre used and the stability of the system: The higher pH, the higer<br>
the tendency towards instability of the system. Surprisingly, the fibres provide<br>
systems with high stability, despite the relatively high pH.<br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: The Minimum DFT where mud-crack appears is significantly<br>
increased in the model paints compared to the standard paint. The resistance<br>
towards mud-cracking is therefore significantly improved<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: The Minimum DFT where mud-crack appears is significantly<br>
decreased as the amount of accelerator in the model paint is increased.<br>
However, this can be countered by incorporation of fibres.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: No rust or blistering were seen on the three coat systems<br>
and the adhesion was perfect which indicates that the performance of the model<br>
paint systems are acceptable and on level with the superior performance of the<br>
standard systems.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: No adhesion problems were seen on the three coat systems<br>
and the adhesion was approved which indicates that the performance of the<br>
model paint systems are acceptable and on level with the superior performance<br>
of the standard systems.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: No pull-off problems were seen on the three coat systems<br>
and the adhesion was approved which indicates that the performance of the<br>
model paint systems are acceptable and on level with the superior performance<br>
of the standard systems.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Remarks to results: No problems with resistance to chemicals were seen on the<br>
tested panels which indicates that the performances of the model paint systems<br>
are acceptable and on level with the superior performance of the standard<br>
systems.<br>
