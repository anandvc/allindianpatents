[0001] This application claims benefit under 35 U S C § 119(e) of provisional U S<br>
patent application No 60/845,314 filed September 18, 2006 and U S patent application No<br>
11/856,476, filed September 17, 2007<br>
[0002] The Contents of the above-referenced patent applications is herein incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention relates to chemical compounds that are useful, for<br>
example, as protein kinase inhibitors for treating cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune<br>
disorders, and other diseases, and methods of using such compounds<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
|0004] Homeostasis requires signaling between cells to coordinate activities such as<br>
cellular proliferation and differentiation Inappropriate signaling can cause or exacerbate immune<br>
system pathologies, such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation, as well as<br>
neurological and cardiovascular maladies In particular, cancer, the uncontrolled proliferation of<br>
cells, is strongly associated with breakdown in normal cellular signaling Signaling often<br>
involves catalyzed transfer of phosphoryl groups to and from serine, threonine, and tyrosine<br>
residues on proteins as part of signal transduction, a step catalyzed by enzymes called protein<br>
kinases For this reason, efforts to treat cancer and other diseases have directed attention to<br>
inhibition of protein kinases<br><br>
[0005] CK2, an essential senne/threonine protein kinase, until recently has not been<br>
considered as a possible target in cancer chemotherapy, but a wide variety of cancers exhibit<br>
elevated levels of CK2 activity that correlate with the aggressiveness of tumor growth<br>
Furthermore, decreasing CK2 activity, through use of small molecules, dominant negative<br>
overexpression of kinase inactive mutants, anti-sense methods, or small interfering RNAs,<br>
decreases cellular proliferation, increases the level of apoptosis in cancer cells, and eradicates the<br>
PC3 human prostate cancer cells from tumor-bearing mice Existing C2 inhibitors such as<br>
emodin, coumanns, TBB (tnazole), quinazohnes, DRB and quercetm, however, while useful for<br>
laboratory studies, lack the qualities of a clinically useful chemotherapeutic agent<br>
[0006] A need remains, therefore, for compounds that inhibit CK2 activity for treating<br>
pathologies associated with phosphorylation catalyzed by this protein kinase<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] One aspect of the present invention provides a new class of protein kinase<br>
inhibitors based upon macrocychc pyTazolo[l,5-a][l,3,5]tnazine and pyrazolo[l,5-a]pynmidine<br>
compounds, methods of using them, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically<br>
active metabolites, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof Such compounds, prodrugs,<br>
metabolites, polymorphs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are collectively referred<br>
to as "agents"<br>
[0008] The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an<br>
effective amount of an agent with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable earners<br>
[0009] Thus, the inventive agents and pharmaceutical compositions containing such<br>
agents are useful in treating various diseases including but not limited to those associated with<br>
uncontrolled or un-wanted cellular proliferation such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, viral<br>
diseases, fungal diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases<br>
|0010| Preferred agents modulate and/or inhibit the activity of CK2 protein kinase<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions containing such agents are useful in treating diseases<br>
mediated by kinase activity, such as cancer<br>
[0011] The invention relates generally to compounds of Formula (I), as well as<br>
prodrugs, pharmaceutically active metabolites, polymorphs, and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts thereof<br><br>
wherein <br>
Rl is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl.<br>
R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl;<br>
R3 groups are independently hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl,aryl,<br>
heteroaryl, or halo:<br>
(C) is a group selected from optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl where n =<br>
2-6<br>
X is CH or N.<br>
[0012] The invention also relates to methods of treating proliferative diseases such as<br>
cancer, auto immune diseases, viral diseases, fungal diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and<br>
cardiovascular diseases, comprising administration of effective amounts of an agent of the<br>
invention to a subject in need of such treatment.<br>
[0013] The invention further relates to methods of modulating and/or inhibiting the<br>
protein kinase activity of CK2 by administering a compound of Formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceuticaily acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt of such compound or metabolite thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] Unless otherwise specified, technical terms here take their usual meanings,<br>
specifically those specified in the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms,<br>
6th edition.<br>
[0015] "Alkyl" refers to straight or branched hydrocarbon chains containing from 1 to 8<br>
carbon atoms, while "alkylene" and "alkynyl" refer to the corresponding chains containing a<br>
double- or triple bond, respectively. Alkyl, alkylene, and alkynyl groups may be optionally<br>
substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of mercapto, nitro,<br>
cyano, azido and halo.<br>
[0016] "Heteroaryl" refers to 5- and 6-membered aromatic rings having one or more<br>
heteroatoms selected independently from N, O, and S.<br><br>
[00171 In preferred embodiments of the invention, Rl is aryl, preferably substituted<br>
aryl, more preferably substituted phenyl It has been found that compounds in which Rl is N-<br>
alkyl-N-alkylpyrrohdinyl-carbonyl-phenyl (e g , N-methyl-N-(l-methyl-pyrrohdinyl)-carbonyl)-<br>
phenyl, as in compound llg) or N-alkyl-N-alkylaminoalkyl (e g , N-methyl-N-ethylaminoethyl,<br>
as in compound 11 s) are particularly useful In certain preferred compounds, each R2 and R3<br>
group is hydrogen, (C) is alkyl, n = 4, and/or X is N<br>
[0018) Pynmidine- (X = C) and tnazine-based (X = N) compounds of Formula (I) are<br>
useful, for example, for influencing the activity of protein kinases More particularly, the<br>
compounds are useful as anti-proliferation agents, thus providing treatments for cancer or other<br>
diseases associated with cellular proliferation mediated by protein kinases<br>
[0019] The inventive agents may be prepared by synthetic schemes described below<br>
Tnazine-based compounds of Formula (I), for example, can be prepared according to Scheme 1<br><br>
[0020] Synthesis of such compounds started from dicyano compounds (1) Treatment<br>
with NaH followed by ethylformate gave intermediate 2-formyl-dinitnle derivatives, which on<br>
treatment with hydrazine cyclized to provide 4-substituted ammo pyrazoles (2) Compounds (2)<br>
were then treated with ethoxycarbonyhsothiocyanate to form thiourea intermediates that<br>
spontaneously cy-chze under basic conditions to provide compounds (3)<br>
[0021] Benzylation followed by chlonnation of compounds (3) gives corresponding<br>
compounds (4) and (5) The chloro group of compounds (5) was then replaced by a primary<br>
amine under mild condition to provide (6) Treatment of compounds (6) with mCPBA oxidized<br>
the benzylsulfanyl groups to the corresponding benzylsulfonyl ones (7) The activated<br>
benzylsulfonyl group of corn-pounds (7) was then displaced by phenyl diamines to form<br>
compounds (8)<br><br>
[0022] Treatment of compounds (8) with HC1 gas in methanol gave compounds (9),<br>
which upon hydrolysis in basic conditions afforded compounds (10). Treatment of compounds<br>
(10) with cou-pling reagents afforded the desired macrocychc compounds (11)<br>
[0023] In a similar manner, pyrimidme-based (X = CH) compounds of Formula (I)<br>
were prepared ac-cording to Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
[0024] 4-Substituted amino pyrazole (2) was first treated with chlorocarbonyl-acetic<br>
acid ethyl ester to give the diacylated intermediates, which were then cyclized in the presence of<br>
base to corn-pounds (12). Dichlorination gave compounds (13), after which amine displacements<br>
provided compounds (14 and 15). Treatment of compounds (15) with HO gas in methanol and<br>
refluxing in methanol gave compounds (16). Alkaline hydrolysis gave compounds (17) and<br>
macrocychza-tion afforded final product (18).<br>
[0025] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates of compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be used Such salts include those formed from, for example, hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, fumanc, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycohc, maleic,<br>
tartaric, citric, malonic, and methanesulfonic acids.<br>
[0026] Certain compounds may include a chiral center, in which case each enantiomer<br>
as well as the corresponding racemate is encompassed in the present invention.<br>
[0027] The present invention also is directed to pharmaceutical formulations that<br>
include the inventive compounds, regardless of the intended mode of administration<br>
[0028] Therapeutic dosages of compounds of the present inventions can be readily<br>
determined by methods well-known in the art.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
[0029] In the examples described below, unless otherwise indicated, all parts and<br>
percentages are by weight. Reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company or Lancaster Synthesis, and were used without further purification unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>

was synthesized and purified.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
CK2 PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITION ASSAY:<br>
[0053] CK2 protein kinase activity was measured through use of a spectrophotometric<br>
PK/LDH coupled assay to detect ATP turnover. Full Length His-tagged Human CK2 was<br>
cloned, expressed, and purified from an E. coli expression system. The peptide substrate for CK2<br>
phosphorylation was RRRDDDSDDD (Genscript Corporation, Piscataway, NJ, USA). A typical<br>
CK2 enzymatic assay contained ~-20 nM human CK2, 100 μM peptide substrate, 50 mM Tris-<br>
HCI pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCI2, 200 uM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM<br>
phosphoenol pyruvate, 150 μM NADH, 0.5% PK/LDH Mix (Sigma #P-0294), 2.5% DMSO and<br>
50 μM ATP. Inhibitor compounds were suspended in 100% DMSO and added to achieve various<br>
concentrations at a constant DMSO proportion of 2.5% by volume. Prior to the addition of ATP<br>
to initiate the phosphorylation reaction, CK2 enzyme was pre-incubated with inhibitors and other<br>
assay components for 5 min. Progress of the reaction was continuously monitored by the change<br>
in UV/Vis absorbance at 340 am. Reaction rates were plotted versus inhibitor concentration and<br>
Ki values were fitted with the assumption of competitive inhibition and use of a Km value of 10<br>
uM In the case of very potent binding, tight-binding methods were employed to determine Ki.<br>
The results are recorded in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
INHIBITION OF CELL GROWTH<br>
f0054] HCT-116 and PC-3 cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 and in 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum with McCoy's 5A modified medium and F-12 K medium respectively. Cells were<br>
plated on 96 well plates at a density of 2,000-4,000/well in the volume of 100 uL medium. After<br>
overnight incubation, 50 uL more medium containing various amount of CK2 inhibitors were<br>
added into each well to give final inhibitor concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 20 uM in 1%<br>
dimethylsulfoxide. The control wells contained 1% dimethylsulfoxide only in their medium.<br><br>
After further incubation of three to five days to allow cells grow before the control cells reach<br>
confluence, 15 μL/well MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) were added and incubated for 4 h After the<br>
incubation, the medium was removed and the newly generated formazan solubihzed with<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (100 μL/well) and measured at 540 nm The absorption data were fit into<br>
equation and calculated for IC50 values through use of the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy<br>
Software) The fitting equation for IC50 is y = a + b/(l+(x/IC50)), x is the compound<br>
concentration, a is the background absorption at 540 nM, and b is the absorption at zero<br>
compound concentration The results are recorded in Tables 1 and 2<br>
