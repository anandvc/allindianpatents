3. The present invention relates to a " SEA WAVE POWER GENERATOR " and in particular, a device to transfer the sea wave force in to electrical energy. This device can also be used to tap the energy from the surface motion or flow of any liquid including water flow in the rivers and canals.<br>
The sea waves contains abundant force in it. This force or energy can be converted in to other forms of energy such as mechanical energy, potential energy, electrical energy, etc.. This device can convert the wave energy in to electrical energy.<br>
The sea waves near the sea shore, usually moves towards the shore. And the upper layer of the sea water near shore moves towards the shore with or without visible waves. In the canals and rivers the water flows from one direction to the other. This device specially designed to convert the energy from the movement of the sea waves as well as the energy of river or canal flow. The central problem for such a device is in effectively registering, capturing and transferring the energy from sea waves and water flow in the rivers.<br>
The specialties and the novelties in this invention are<br>
1. The generator is 'built-in' in the motoring (driving) body itself. There is no external separation of generating unit and driving or motoring unit. That is, the power producing system is completely enclosed by the motoring unit. But, in any other electric generator, the generating unit and motoring unit are separately identified and both are connected by the central shafts of both by means of bush or flange.<br><br>
2. The force registered by the motoring unit from the waves is conveyed to the power generating system directly or through a gear system. This gear system called  centrally suspended self reversal gear system'. This special gear system is responsible for the simultaneous rotation of the magnet and power producing coil in reverse wise to each other. The current producing coil is attached with the motoring unit and the magnet is also driven by the motoring unit, but through the gear system. But, in other electric generators, the power producing coil is at static and not directly or indirectly attached to the motoring unit. But the magnet is connected to the central shaft of the motoring unit and without gears. That is, the magnet is rotated while the coil is static.<br>
3. The current producing system is fully enclosed by the motoring system. The motoring system itself act as a cover to the current producing system.<br>
4. A special gear system is employed. Because of the special gear system. Because of the special gear system. Each rotation of the motoring unit can be multiplied according to the need.<br>
The concept of this device is explained in detail in the following paragraphs with reference to the accompanying diagrams ( fig. 1 and 2 ) in which the concept is represented systematically and symbolically. The fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of the device and the fig. 2 is a side elevation of the device.<br>
The whole structure can be explained in to four systems.<br><br>
1.	The motoring system.<br>
2.	The  centrally  suspended  self reversal  gear  system  which connects the motoring system and power producing system.<br>
3.	An in-built power generating system.<br>
4.	Stability and mooring system.<br>
THE MOTORING SYSTEM:<br>
This system consists of a tubular housing (no. 1), paddles (no. 19), rigid walls (no.2), to support the current producing coils (no. 17) and the rib gears (no.3). The tubular housing is a horizontal tubular body within which all the other components of this device (except the stability and mooring system) are built-in. The tubular housing (no.l) is floatable in water and less than half of the portion will be submerged in the water.<br>
There are several paddles (no. 19) or fins are mounted over the outer surface of the housing at equal distance and at right angle to the surface and pointing outwards. The submerged paddles are continuously pushed by the waves or by the moving water layer. Thus the paddles (no. 19) helps to rotate the tubular housing (no. 1) in the same direction continuously. The rigid walls (no.2) are the walls constructed in side the housing, perpendicularly and at right angle to the tubular housing (no.l). The rib gear (no.3) is firmly fixed to the side surface of the rigid walls (no.2). The rigid walls (no.2) also carrying the central rod of the gear arrangement. The bearings (no.4)<br><br>
are mounted in between the central rod (no.5) and the rigid walls (no.2). These bearings (no.4) permit the central rod (no.5) to rotate freely and independent of the rigid walls (no.2).<br>
Thus the force is registered by the motoring system at the paddles (no. 19) and transferred to the gear system through the rib gear (no.3) which is rotated along with the tubular housing (no. 1).<br>
THE CENTRALLY SUSPENDED SELF REVERSAL GEAR SYSTEM:<br>
This gear system consists of the (loading gears) Rib gears (no.3) and gears of different sizes (nos. 7,9,10,12,13) and the gear carrying rods (no.5,8,11) and weight mass (no.20) and bearings (nos. 4,14,15,16).<br>
The rib gear (no.3) is a large gear mounted to the side of the rigid wall (no.2). The rib gears (no.3) turns the small gears (no.7) which are firmly attached at both ends of the rod (no.8). The gear no.9 is also firmly attached to the rod no. 8, is also rotated along with the gear no. 7. The gear no.9 rotates the contact gear no. 10 which is firmly attached to the rod no. 11. The gear no. 12 which is firmly fixed to the rod no. 11, is also rotated. The gear no. 12 in turn rotates the gear no. 13 which is firmly fixed with the central gear rod (no.5). This central rod is held by the rigid walls (no.2). The bearings (no.4) permits the central gear rod (no.5) to rotate independent of the rigid walls (no.2). The magnets (no. 18) are attached to the central gear rod, at both ends.<br><br>
when the tubular housing (no.l) turned in the clockwise direction the Rib gears (no.3) and the current producing coils (no. 17) also turned in the same clock wise direction. The gear no.3 turns the gear no.7 in anti-clockwise direction. The gear no.9 which is turned along with the gear no.7, turns the gear no.10 in clockwise direction. The gear no.12 which is turned along with the gear no. 10, turns the gear no. 13 in anti-clockwise direction. Thus, the magnets which are firmly attached with the central rod (no.5) turned in the anti clockwise direction. Thus, the current producing coils (no. 17) and the magnets (no. 18) are rotated in opposite direction to each other, simultaneously.<br>
And the number of rotations of the magnets (no. 18) is far more than the number of rotations of the coils (no. 17) because of the special gear system called 'Centrally suspended self reversal gear system'. The bearings (nos. 4,14,15,16) helps free rotation of the gear carrying rods(nos. 5,11,8).<br>
The weight mass  (no. 20)  keeps  the  gear system  always suspended vertically and always pointing downwards, due to gravity pull of the weight mass. THE 'BUILT - IN' POWER GENERATING SYSTEM.<br>
TTiis system consists of magnets (no. 18) power generating coils (no. 17) Carbon bush assembly (nos.22, 23). The magnets (no. 18) are firmly attached with the central rod (no.5) at both ends.<br>
The current production coils are attached to the side surface of the rigid walls (no.2). The carbon brush assembly (nos. 22 and 23) helps to bring the power generated, to outside.<br><br>
THE STABILITY AND MOORING SYSTEM:<br>
This system consists of supporting floats (no.24) water seals (no.25)<br>
and bearings (no.21).<br>
The whole apparatus is floatable and submerged in water by less than half portion. The supporting float (no.24) is an empty doom helps to keep the apparatus float at the required level in water. The flexible ropes are used for mooring as shown in the fig. 2.<br>
The water seals (no.25) are provided where ever necessary to keep the whole device water proof<br>
