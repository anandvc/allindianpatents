				<td>PROCESS FOR THE EPOXIDATION OF OLEFINS<br>
Prior Art<br>
From EP-A 100 119 it is known that propene can be converted by hydrogen<br>
peroxide into propene oxide if a titanium-containing zeolite is used as<br>
catalyst.<br>
Unreacted hydrogen peroxide cannot be recovered economically from the<br>
epoxidation reaction mixture. Furthermore, unreacted hydrogen peroxide<br>
involves additional effort and expenditure in the working up of the<br>
reaction mixture. The epoxidation of propene is therefore preferably<br>
carried out with an excess of propene and up to a high hydrogen peroxide<br>
conversion. In order to achieve a high hydrogen peroxide conversion it<br>
is advantageous to use a continuous flow reaction system. Such a<br>
reaction system may comprise either one or more tubular flow reactors or<br>
an arrangement of two or more flow mixing reactors connected in series.<br>
Examples of flow mixing reactors are stirred tank reactors, recycle<br>
reactors, fluidized bed reactors and fixed bed reactors with recycling<br>
of the liquid phase.<br>
In order to achieve a high reaction rate a high propene concentration in<br>
the liquid phase is necessary. The reaction is therefore preferably<br>
carried out under a propene atmosphere at elevated pressure with the<br>
effect that a multiphase reaction system is in general present.<br>
Furthermore the epoxidation of olefins with hydroperoxides is like most<br>
oxidation reactions highly exothermic. Thus precautions have to be taken<br>
to ensure sufficient removal of the heat generated by the exothermic<br>
reaction in order to control the reaction. This problem is especially<br>
pronounced in continuos flow systems using fixed bed reactors. Moreover<br>
conversion and product selectivity in epoxidation reactions of olefins<br>
are highly susceptible to temperature changes with the effect that<br>
efficient temperature control is off uppermost importance.<br>
In A. Gianetto, "Multiphase Reactors: Types, Characteristics and Uses",<br>
in Multiphase Chemical Reactors: Theory, Design, Scale-up, Hemisphere<br>
Publishing Corporation, 1986 criteria governing the choice between up-<br>
flow and down-flow fixed bed multiphase reactors are given. Advantages<br>
of up-flow regime compared to down-flow regime are:<br>
better mixing resulting in improved heat and mass transfer;<br>
at the same fluid flow rates the up-flow operation provides higher<br>
volumetric gas/liquid mass transfer coefficients;<br>
better liquid distribution in the cross section;<br>
better heat dissipation and more uniform temperature;<br>
better wetting of the catalyst and therefore increased catalyst<br>
effectiveness;<br>
slower aging of the catalyst<br>
avoiding compacting of the catalyst bed.<br>
Disadvantages are:<br>
larger pressure drops and higher energy expenditure for pumping;<br>
reactor has to comprise means to hold the catalyst in place in<br>
case of high velocities;<br>
higher mass transfer resistance inside the liquid and an increase<br>
in possible homogeneous side reactions can occur.<br>
In view of the advantages with respect to heat transfer and dissipation<br>
up-flow operation of a fixed bed reactor for multiphase reaction systems<br>
is the natural choice for highly exothermic reactions where temperature<br>
control is important.<br>
This is also reflected in WO 97/47614 where in example 8 reaction of<br>
propene with hydrogen peroxide using a fixed bed tubular reactor having<br>
a cooling jacket in up-flow operation is described. But nevertheless<br>
yield and product selectivity are still insufficient for commercial<br>
purposes.<br>
EP-A 659 473 describes an epoxidation process wherein a liquid mixture<br>
of hydrogen peroxide, solvent and propene is led over a succession of<br>
fixed bed reaction zones connected in series in down-flow operation. No<br>
temperature control means are present within the reactor to remove the<br>
generated heat from the single reaction zones. Thus each reaction zone<br>
can be considered as an independent adiabatic reactor. In each reaction<br>
zone the reaction is performed to a partial conversion, the liquid<br>
reaction mixture is removed from each reaction zone, is led over an<br>
external heat exchanger to extract the heat of reaction, and the major<br>
proportion of this liquid phase is then recycled to this reaction zone<br>
and a minor proportion of the liquid phase is passed to the next zone.<br>
At the same time gaseous propene is fed in together with the liquid feed<br>
stock mixture, is guided in a parallel stream to the liquid phase over<br>
the fixed bed reaction zones, and is extracted at the end of the<br>
reaction system in addition to the liquid reaction mixture as an oxygen-<br>
containing waste gas stream. Although this reaction procedure enables<br>
the propene oxide yield to be raised compared to conventional tubular<br>
reactors without the temperature control described in EP-A 659 473. it<br>
nevertheless involves considerable additional costs on account of the<br>
complexity of the reaction system required to carry out the process.<br>
From US-A 5 849 937 a process for epoxidation of propene using<br>
hydroperoxides especially organic hydroperoxides is known. The reaction<br>
mixture is fed to a cascade of serially connected fixed bed reactors in<br>
down-flow regime with respect to each single reactor. Similarly to the<br>
teaching of EP-A 659 473 in each reactor only partial conversion is<br>
accomplished and the reactors are not equipped with heat exchange means.<br>
Like in EP-A 659 473 the reaction heat is removed by passing the<br>
effluent from each reactor through heat exchangers prior to introducing<br>
the reaction mixture to the next fixed bed reactor in series thereby<br>
adding to the complexity of the reaction system.<br>
The disadvantages of the reaction systems as discussed in EP-A 659 473<br>
and US-A 5 849 937 are the complexity and thus the increased costs for<br>
investment and the high susceptibility to changes of process parameters<br>
like flow velocity due to the adiabaticly operated independent reaction<br>
zones and reactors respectively.<br>
In view of the cited prior art the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process for the epoxidation of olefins that results in<br>
improved conversion and product selectivity compared to WO 97/47614<br>
while avoiding the disadvantages of the teachings of EP-A 659 473 and<br>
US-A 5 849 937 which can be carried out using conventional reaction<br>
systems.<br>
Subject of the Invention<br>
This object is achieved by a process for the catalytic epoxidation of<br>
olefins with hydrogen peroxide in a continuous flow reaction system,<br>
wherein the reaction mixture is passed through a fixed catalyst bed in<br>
down-flow operation mode and the reaction heat is at least partially<br>
removed during the course of the reaction. The process of the present<br>
invention is therefore preferably conducted in a fixed bed reactor<br>
comprising cooling means.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention refers to a<br>
process for the catalytic epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide<br>
in a continuous flow reaction system conducted in a multiphase reaction<br>
mixture comprising an liquid aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich phase<br>
containing methanol and an liquid organic propene rich phase, wherein<br>
the reaction mixture is passed through a fixed catalyst bed in down-flow<br>
operation mode and the reaction heat is at least partially removed<br>
during the course of the reaction.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly discovered, contrary to the<br>
general textbook knowledge as exemplified by A. Gianetto supra, that a<br>
cooled fixed bed reactor can be successfully operated in a down-flow<br>
operation to increase product selectivity and thereby overall product<br>
yield compared to an up-flow operation as previously used in the prior<br>
art. This effect is even more surprising since it is known that the<br>
epoxidation of olefin is a highly exothermic reaction that is difficult<br>
to control since this reaction has a considerably high activation<br>
temperature and therefore has to be conducted at a certain minimum<br>
temperature to achieve economically reasonable conversion. But on the<br>
other hand the heat generated by the exothermic reaction has to be<br>
effectively removed from the reactor since at increased temperatures<br>
unwanted side reactions take place with the result that product<br>
selectivity is decreased. The effect of limited temperature increase<br>
within the catalyst bed is discussed to some extent in EP-A-659 473.<br>
With respect to the examples it is disclosed that in conventional<br>
tubular reactors temperature rise in the catalyst bed exceeds 15°C<br>
whereas according to the examples in EP-A-659 473 the temperature rise<br>
is 8°C at the most and in the preferred embodiment 5½°C. Thus according<br>
to the teaching of EP-A-659 473 temperature rise within the catalyst bed<br>
has to be kept as low as possible in order to achieve high yields of<br>
propylene oxide. This reduced temperature rise could only be achieved<br>
according to EP-A-659 473 by conducting the reaction in a single<br>
reaction zone to only a partial conversion with the result that the<br>
majority of the reaction mixture has to be recycled, and by<br>
intermediately cooling the reaction mixture.<br>
According to the teaching of A. Gianetto et al. when operating a<br>
conventional tubular fixed bed reactor poor heat dissipation and<br>
nonuniform temperature within the catalyst bed has to be expected in<br>
case of downflow operation mode. Thus it has to be expected that by<br>
using a downflow operation mode in a conventional cooled fixed bed<br>
reactor without intermediate external cooling of the reaction mixture a<br>
high temperature rise within the catalyst bed due to poor heat<br>
dissipation would occur that should dramatically decrease product<br>
selectivity and thus the yield. But contrary to this expectation, as<br>
will be shown in more detail below in the examples, better product<br>
selectivity at the same conversion compared to up-flow operation mode is<br>
achieved and similar or even better overall yields based on hydrogen<br>
peroxide compared to the most preferred embodiments in EP-A-659 473 are<br>
obtainable although a conventional reactor system without intermediate<br>
external cooling was used.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the practice of the present invention any reactor having a fixed<br>
catalyst bed and cooling means can be used. Adiabatic reaction<br>
conditions as taught in EP-A 659 473 and US-A 5 849 937 should be<br>
avoided. Preferably, tubular, multi-tubular or multi-plate reactors are<br>
used. Most preferably, tubular reactors having a cooling jacket are<br>
applied since they are standardly available at relatively low cost. As<br>
cooling medium that is pumped through the cooling means, preferably the<br>
cooling jacket, all standard cooling media like oils, alcohols, liquid<br>
salts or water can be used. Water is most preferred.<br>
The process according to the invention for the epoxidation of olefins,<br>
preferably propene, is typically carried out at a temperature of 30° to<br>
80°C, preferably at 40° to 60°C. According to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention the temperature profile within the reactor is<br>
maintained such that the cooling medium temperature of the cooling means<br>
of the tubular reactor is at least 40°C and the maximum temperature<br>
within the catalyst bed is 60°C at the most, preferably 55°C. By<br>
preference the temperature of the cooling medium is controlled by a<br>
thermostat.<br>
The maximum temperature within the catalyst bed is measured with a<br>
plurality of suitable temperature measurement means like thermocouples<br>
or a Pt-100 arranged approximately along the axis of the preferably<br>
tubular reactor in suitable distances with respect to each other.<br>
Whereby number, position within the reactor and distances between the<br>
temperature measurement means are adjusted to measure the temperature of<br>
the catalyst bed within the entire reactor as exact as necessary.<br>
The maximum temperature of the catalyst bed can be adjusted by different<br>
means. Depending on the selected reactor type the maximum temperature of<br>
the catalyst bed can be adjusted by controlling the flow rate of the<br>
reaction mixture passing through the reactor, by controlling the flow<br>
rate of the cooling medium passing through the cooling means or by<br>
lowering the catalyst activity, for instance by diluting the catalyst<br>
with inert material.<br>
The flow rate of the cooling medium is preferably adjusted to keep the<br>
temperature difference between entry of the cooling medium into the<br>
cooling means and exit below 5°C, preferably below 3°C, most preferably<br>
2°C.<br>
By selecting such a narrowly defined temperature profile within the<br>
reactor an optimized balance between hydrogen peroxide conversion and<br>
olefin oxide selectivity can be achieved.<br>
The pressure within the reactor is usually maintained at 5 to 50 bar<br>
preferably 15 to 30 bar.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the reaction mixture is passed<br>
through the catalyst bed with a superficial velocity from 1 to 100 m/h,<br>
preferably 5 to 50 m/h, most preferred 5 to 30 m/h. The superficial<br>
velocity is defined as the ratio of volume flow rate/cross section of<br>
the catalyst bed. Consequently the superficial velocity can be varied in<br>
a given reactor by adjusting the flow rate of the reaction mixture.<br>
Additionally it is preferred to pass the reaction mixture through the<br>
catalyst bed with a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) from 1 to 20 h-1,<br>
preferably 1.3 to 15 h-1.<br>
Whenever the flow rate of the reaction mixture is adjusted to fulfill<br>
the above defined requirements for superficial velocity and liquid<br>
hourly space velocity particularly high selectivities can be achieved.<br>
According to particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
the process is conducted to maintain the catalyst bed in a trickle bed<br>
state. It has been surprisingly discovered that if the trickle bed state<br>
is maintained under certain flow conditions the effect of the present<br>
invention i.e. the increased propene oxide selectivity will be<br>
particularly pronounced.<br>
These conditions are as follows:<br>
G/? 
L? 
wherein<br>
G is the gaseous superficial velocity defined as the gaseous flow rate<br>
in mVh in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of<br>
the catalyst bed in m2,<br>
L is the liquid superficial velocity defined as the liquid flow rate in<br>
mVh in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of the<br>
catalyst bed in m2,<br>
?G is the density of the gaseous phase in g/cm3,<br>
?L is the density of the liquid phase in g/cm3,<br>
?W is the density of water in g/cm3.<br>
?Alr is the density of air in g/cm3,<br>
sw is the surface tension of water in dyn/cm.<br>
sL is the surface tension of the liquid phase in dyn/cm.<br>
µL is the viscosity of the liquid phase in centipoise.<br>
µw is the viscosity of water in centipoise.<br>
In order to be able to operate the process continuously when changing<br>
and/or regenerating the epoxidation catalyst, two or more flow reactors<br>
may if desired also be operated in parallel or in series in the before-<br>
described manner.<br>
Crystalline, titanium-containing zeolites especially those of the<br>
composition (Ti02)x(SiO2)1-x where x is from 0.001 to 0.05 and having a MFI<br>
or MEL crystalline structure, known as titanium silicalite-1 and<br>
titanium silicalite-2, are suitable as catalysts for the epoxidation<br>
process according to the invention. Such catalysts may be produced for<br>
example according to the process described in US-A 4.410.501. The<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst may be employed as a shaped catalyst in the<br>
form of granules, extrudates or shaped bodies. For the forming process<br>
the catalyst may contain 1 to 99% of a binder or carrier material, all<br>
binders and carrier materials being suitable that do not react with<br>
hydrogen peroxide or with the epoxide under the reaction conditions<br>
employed for the epoxielation. Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm<br>
are preferably used as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
When practicing the present invention it is preferred that the overall<br>
feed stream to the reactor comprises an aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution, an olefin and an organic solvent. Thereby these components may<br>
be introduced into the reactor as independent feeds or one or more of<br>
these feeds are mixed prior to introduction into the reactor.<br>
Using the process according to the invention any olefins can be<br>
epoxidized in particular olefins with 2 to 6 carbon atoms. The process<br>
according to the invention is most particularly suitable for the<br>
epoxidation of propene to propene oxide. For economic reasons it would<br>
be preferred for an industrial scale process to use propene not in a<br>
pure form but as a technical mixture with propane that as a rule<br>
contains 1 to 15 vol.% of propane. Propene may be fed as a liquid as<br>
well as in gaseous form into the reaction system.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide is used in the process according to the invention<br>
in the form of an aqueous solution with a hydrogen peroxide content of 1<br>
to 90 wt.%, preferably 10 to 70 wt.% and particularly preferably 30 to<br>
50 wt.%. The hydrogen peroxide may be used in the form of the<br>
commercially available, stabilised solutions. Also suitable are<br>
unstabilised, aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions such as are obtained<br>
in the anthraquinone process for producing hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent in<br>
order to increase the solubility of the olefin, preferably propene, in<br>
the liquid phase. Suitable as solvent are all solvents that are not<br>
oxidised or are oxidised only to a slight extent by hydrogen peroxide<br>
under the chosen reaction conditions, and that dissolve in an amount of<br>
more than 10 wt.% in water. Preferred are solvents that are completely<br>
miscible with water. Suitable solvents include alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol or tert. butanol; glycols such as for example ethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2-propanediol or 1,3-propanediol; cyclic ethers such as for<br>
example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or propylene oxide; glycol ethers such<br>
as for example ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether or propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, and ketones such as for example acetone or 2-butanone.<br>
Methanol is particularly preferably used as solvent.<br>
The olefin is preferably employed in excess relative to the hydrogen<br>
peroxide in order to achieve a significant consumption of hydrogen<br>
peroxide, the molar ratio of olefin, preferably propene, to hydrogen<br>
peroxide preferably being chosen in the range from 1.1 to 30. The<br>
solvent is preferably added in a weight ratio of 0.5 to 20 relative to<br>
the amount of hydrogen peroxide solution used. The amount of catalyst<br>
employed may be varied within wide limits and is preferably chosen so<br>
that a hydrogen peroxide consumption of more than 90% preferably more<br>
than 95%, is achieved within 1 minute to 5 hours under the employed<br>
reaction conditions.<br>
According to one embodiment of the resent invention reaction conditions<br>
like temperature, pressure, selection of olefin and selection of solvent<br>
and relative amounts of the components of the reaction mixture are<br>
chosen to ensure the presence of only one aqueous liquid phase wherein<br>
the olefin is dissolved. An additional gaseous olefin containing phase<br>
may also be present.<br>
But it is preferred to conduct the epoxidation of olefins with hydrogen<br>
peroxide in a multiphase reaction mixture comprising an liquid aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide rich phase containing an organic solvent having a<br>
solubility in water of at least 10% by weight at 25°C and an liquid<br>
organic olefin rich phase. Thereby an even better product selectivity<br>
can be achieved.<br>
As is appreciable by any person skilled in the art the presence of two<br>
immiscible liquid phases in a reaction system comprising an olefin, an<br>
water miscible organic solvent and an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
will depend on many different factors. First of all the presence of an<br>
additional olefin rich liquid organic phase will depend on the<br>
temperature and pressure applied in the reactor and the selected olefin.<br>
Preferably the applied pressure is at or above the vapor pressure of<br>
the olefin at the chosen temperature. Furthermore it will depend on the<br>
selection of the organic solvent. Suitable as organic solvent are all<br>
solvents that dissolve in an amount of more than 10 wt.% in water at<br>
25°C. Preferred are solvents that dissolve in an amount of more than 30<br>
wt.% in water at 25°C preferably more than 50 wt.% in water at 25°C. The<br>
most preferred solvents are completely miscible with water. In principle<br>
all solvents as exemplified above can also be used in this preferred<br>
embodiment as long as the conditions are met to ensure the presence of<br>
two liquid phases.<br>
Additionally the presence of a second organic olefin rich phase will<br>
depend on the relative amounts of olefin, water and solvent. The amount<br>
of solvent is chosen to achieve sufficient solubility of the olefin in<br>
the hydrogen peroxide rich aqueous phase in order to get the desired<br>
rate of reaction. At a given temperature , pressure, olefin and solvent<br>
the relative amounts of ingredients can be adjusted to ensure formation<br>
of a second liquid organic phase. I.e. to ensure the formation of a<br>
second liquid organic olefin rich phase the amount of olefin has to be<br>
selected in excess of the amount soluble in the aqueous phase at the<br>
chosen temperature and pressure.<br>
A simple means of experimentally confirming the presence of a second<br>
liquid organic phase at the reaction conditions is by collecting a<br>
sample of the reaction mixture in a container equipped with a sight<br>
glass at the temperature and pressure used in the process.<br>
Alternatively, the reactor may be equipped with a sight glass at a<br>
suitable position to observe the phase boundary directly during the<br>
reaction. In case of a continuous flow reactor the sight glass is<br>
preferably positioned near the outlet of the reactor effluent to have an<br>
optimal control that two liquid phases are present through out the<br>
entire residence time within the reactor.<br>
Thus a person skilled in the art can without any effort verify whether<br>
when applying certain selections for olefins, solvents and reaction<br>
parameters a two-liquid phase system as required by the present<br>
invention is present and can adjust by variation of the parameters as<br>
discussed above in detail the reaction system in order to establish a<br>
second liquid organic phase.<br>
According to a most preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
olefin is selected to be propene, and methanol is used as a solvent. For<br>
example for a reaction mixture comprising propene, methanol, and aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide at a reaction temperature between 30°C and 80°C, a<br>
pressure from 5 to 50 bar the ratio of propene flow to total flow in<br>
case of a continuous flow system can be adjusted to be in the range of<br>
0.1 to 1, preferably 0.2 to 1 in order to obtain a second liquid organic<br>
phase.<br>
An additional gas phase comprising olefin vapor and optionally an inert<br>
gas i.e. a gas that does not interfere with the epoxidation can be<br>
additionally present according to the present invention. Adding an inert<br>
gas is useful to maintain a constant pressure inside the reactor and to<br>
remove oxygen gas formed by the decomposition of a small part of the<br>
hydrogen peroxide charged to the reactor.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail referring to the<br>
following examples:<br>
Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1-4<br>
A titanium-silicate catalyst was employed in all examples. The titanium-<br>
silicate powder was shaped into 2 mm extrudates using a silica sol as<br>
binder in accordance with example 5 in EP 00 106 671.1. The H202 employed<br>
was prepared according to the anthraquinone process as a 40 wt-% aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
Epoxidation is carried out continuously in a reaction tube of 300 ml<br>
volume, a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 4 m. The equipment is<br>
furthermore comprised of three containers for liquids and relevant pumps<br>
and a liquid separating vessel. The three containers for liquids<br>
comprised methanol, the 40% H202 and propene. The 40% H202 was adjusted<br>
with ammonia to a pH of 4.5. The reaction temperature is controlled via<br>
an aqueous cooling liquid circulating in a cooling jacket whereby the<br>
cooling liquid temperature is controlled by a thermostat. The reactor<br>
pressure was 25 bar absolute. Mass flow of the feeding pumps was<br>
adjusted to result in a propene feed concentration of 21.5 wt-%, a<br>
methanol feed concentration of 57 wt-% and an H202 feed concentration of<br>
9.4 wt-%.<br>
When performing the examples and comparative examples flow mode<br>
(downflow (DF) mode or upflow (UF) mode) as well as the cooling jacket<br>
temperature and the total mass flow were varied as indicated in Table 1.<br>
The flow rate was adjusted to achieve comparable conversions. The<br>
product stream was analyzed by gas chromatography and the H202 conversion<br>
was determined by titration. Propene selectivity was calculated as the<br>
ratio of the amount of propene oxide relative to the total amount of<br>
propene oxide and oxygen containing hydrocarbons formed during the<br>
epoxidation reaction such as 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-methoxy-l-propanol<br>
and 1,2-propanediol.<br>
Table 1:<br>
When comparing CE1 and CE2 with CE3 and CE4 it is evident that product<br>
selectivity strongly depends on the reaction temperature with decreasing<br>
selectivity with increasing temperature. Thus good heat dissipation and<br>
uniform temperature is important. In this respect a person skilled in<br>
the art would prefer the up-flow mode. Surprisingly, as can be seen from<br>
comparing E1 and CE2 the results in down-flow mode are even better at<br>
the same reaction temperature.<br>
UF - up-flow mode<br>
DF = down-flow mode<br>
