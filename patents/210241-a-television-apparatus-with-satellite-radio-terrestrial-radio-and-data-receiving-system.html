The invention relates to Television in particular. The invention relates to incorporation of satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data. The object of the invention is to incorporate the satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data in a television and the facility of switching (switch ON/OFF ) the power supply which is given to the video section, CRT filament section and the radio sections. The features of the satellite radio, terrestrial radio including the frequency tuning, volume control etc.,. and data can be seen on the a) Television screen also b) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD ) screen. A provision for a digital data port need to be fixed in the television set for the multimedia service viz. slow motion image, mailing etc.,. and also for connecting computers, laptop etc.,. The facility for switching (ON/OFF) of the video section in order to listen to the television audio only. The sound amplifier section and speaker of television set can be used for satellite radio, terrestrial radio and television audio. In order to incorporate this principle there is a need for technological changes in the existing television. Therefore the circuitry of the known television is changed.<br>
It is the primary object of invention to invent a television which incorporates satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data broadcasting.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent a television which incorporates satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data which results in saving lots of money.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent a television which incorporates satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data which incorporate novel technology.<br><br>
The specialty of the invention is the incorporation of satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data, and the facility to switch ON/OFF the power supply which is given to the radio sections, video section and CRT filament section in a television.<br>
The satellite radio is used to hear the different chaimels provided by the satellite radio stations . It is incorporate in a television to hear the excellent audio quality.<br>
The terrestrial radio is used to hear the different channels provided by the terrestrial radio broadcasting. It is incorporate in a television to hear the audio.<br>
The sound signals in a television are FM ( Frequency Modulated). The quality of the television sound is normally good when compared to radio and monotape recorders . But today the television has an excellent sound effect (i.e.) preference or adjustments of Bass, Treble, AVL ( Auto Volume Leveler ) and equalizer effects . The televisions are having more than one speaker . In addition, for excellent bass results , subwoofer for rich bass is also attached . The power of the audio output is about 40watts, 60 watts ,100 watts ,200 watts ,350 watts etc.,.. The television is having a stereo sound effect . Therefore the sound effect in a television is nearly equal to Hi-If (High Fidelity) music system . The above mentioned sound effects in a television are of excellent quality.<br>
If the television is switched ON, the user can select either television or satellite radio or terrestrial radio or data (i.e.) depending on the preference of the user.<br><br>
But the power supply which is given to the remote section and the sound section is always ON, when the television is switched ON and the user cannot switch OFF those sections.<br>
The user can opt for<br>
1)	Operation of Television set       or<br>
2)	Operation of Satellite radio       or<br>
3)	Operation of Terrestrial radio   or<br>
4)	Operation of Data,    when the television set is switched ON.<br>
1)	If the user opts for the operation of Television, the satellite<br>
radio, terrestrial radio and data does not function automatically ( the power<br>
supply given to satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data is automatically<br>
switched OFF).<br>
When the user watching the video and hearing to audio of television, he can switch OFF the power supply given to the video section and the CRT filament section by pressing a key , named eg: 'video' and can listen to audio only. The power consumption upto 60% can be saved fiow the total consumption of power of the television set when the user presses the 'video' key which is used to switch OFF the video section. Also when the user can make use of the 'video' key and switch ON the video section to watch the video on the television screen.<br>
2)	If the user opts for the operation of Satellite radio, the television<br>
does not function automatically ( the tuning voltage of the television tuner is<br>
switched OFF by a switching and the I.F signal of the television tuner is cut off,<br>
power supply given to terrestrial radio and data is cut off by a switching).<br><br>
3) If the user opts for the operation of Terrestrial radio, the television, satellite radio and data does not function automatically ( the tuning voltage of the television tuner is switched OFF by a switching and the LF signal of the television tuner is cut off, power supply given to satellite radio and data is cut off by a switching).<br>
4 ) If the user opts for the operation of Data, the television, satellite radio and terrestrial radio does not function automatically ( the tuning voltage of the television tuner is switched OFF by a switching and the LF signal of the television tuner is cut off and the sound section in the television are switched 'OFF  automatically, power supply given to satellite radio and terrestrial radio is cut off by a switching, while the operation of data broadcasting the video section can be switched 'ON* or 'OFF' using the 'video' key).<br>
The display of features of the satellite radio, terrestrial radio is achieved in a television set by adopting two possibilities either<br>
a.) By displaying the features on the television screen or<br>
b ) By displaying the features on the LCD screen.<br>
a ) The features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio can be displayed on the television screen. The power supply which is given to the video section and the CRT filament section is switched ON automatic at a time-When the features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio are arranged to be displayed on the television screen, the switching circuit ( CTL 2 ) is not needed. The user can select the features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio viz. frequency tuning, volume control etc.,. which are displayed on the television screen. After selecting the .features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio, the user can switch OFF by pressing the key 'video' [ i.e. switching OFF the power supply which is given to the video section ( CTL 3) and the CRT filament<br><br>
section ( CTL 4 ) ]. Now the user can listen to the satellite radio or terrestrial radio. If necessary, the user can again switch on the key Video' and select the features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio and then switch OFF. Therefore the user can save the power supply nearly 60%. And the life of the components of the video section of the television set viz. LOT, IC's, Transistors, CRT etc.,. is maintained.<br>
b ) The LCD can be fixed with the television set on top or bottom of the television screen. While operating the LCD, the tuning voltage of the television tuner is automatically 'OFF', the power supply which is given to the video section and the CRT filament section is automatically switched OFF by a switching circuit ( CTL 2 ) and also the user cannot operate the Video' key at the time of functioning of satellite and terrestrial radio. As the LCD is fixed to the television set, a switching circuit ( CTL 2 ) is needed separately to switch ON/OFF the operations of the video section and the CRT filament section at a time, and therefore the user can operate the Video' key at the time of functioning of data broadcasting. The remote section in the television set sends the signals to the LCD section for displaying the features of the satellite radio or terrestrial radio or data which is operated by using the key, named eg: Features. The power supply which is required for the operation of LCD section is obtained fiow the provisions given to the radio sections. The power supply of the radio sections can be arranged separately as shown in fig.(l) or can be obtained from the power supply of the sound section of the television set, when a transformer is properly designed with required Amperes for operating both the radio sections and sound section in the television set.<br>
The CRT and the video section is switched ON/OFF simultaneously at a time by the switching circuit   (CTL 2, CTL 3, CTL 4).<br><br>
If the television is without a remote control facility, the user can select television or satellite radio or terrestrial radio or data using switches manually in the front side or any side of the television.<br>
If the television has a remote control facility, the selection of television or satellite radio or terrestrial radio or data is operated by using the remote control and the facility to switch ON/OFF the power supply which is given to the video section and the CRT filament section by using the remote control.<br>
Further objects of the invention are explained from the following description.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the circuit diagram of the power supply of the television with remote control.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the circuit diagram of the remote section in a television.<br>

The power supply of the television with remote control is shown in FIG.l, From the figure 1, the input voltage of the transformer is about 220-220 V A/C. The voltage is fed to the manually control switch ( power ) and from it is fed to the CTLl, which may be a Relax (or) Transistor (or) IC type switching through a flies ( F ). The CTLl is activated by the remote section wherein signal from the remote IC is given to the CTLl to switch ON/OFF the voltage which is given to the input of the transformer. The output of the<br><br>
transformer is nearly about ( a ) 150 V AC, ( b ) 12V or 20V AC, ( c ) 6.3 V AC and ( d ) 12 V or 18 V AC respectively. Using CTL2 , CTL3 , CTL4 and CTL5 can switch ON/OFF of the voltage 150 V AC, 6.3 V AC and 12V or 18 V AC respectively. The CTL2 ,CTL3 and CTL4 are activated by the remote section. Using the Bridge Rectifier ( BR ), 150 V AC is converted to 150 V DC and it is filtered by the capacitor ( C ) and reduced by a resistor (R) and finally it is given as nearly 110 V to 120 V DC and this voltage is fed to (i ) [ video section ]. Similarly 12 V or 20 V DC is fed to ( ii) [ sound section ] and about 12 V or 18 V DC is given to (iv) [ satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data section ]. The voltage 6.3 V AC is fed to (iii) [ CRT filament section ]. The above mentioned output voltage of the transformer is an approximate one and it varies fiow one television to another television (i.e.) Black and White television, Colour television, 14" television, 20" television, 21" television, 25" television etc.,.<br>
The diagram of the remote section in a television is shown in FIG. 2. From the figure 2, the remote section contains Infrared detector. Remote microprocessor ( CPU ), Customer panel and Remote power supply. The television SMPS ( Switch Mode Power supply ) is activated by the remote section using CTLl, CTL2, CTL3, CTL4 and CTL5 respectively . The Infi-ared detector detects the signals received   the handset of remote control and it is fed to the remote microprocessor ( CPU ). The Customer panel includes Brightness, Contrast, Volume control and Sharpness and these are control by the remote microprocessor. The Remote power supply supplies the required voltage to operate the remote section. The Remote microprocessor (CPU ) sends the ,<br>
(i)    Signal to the programme selection to select the particular channel.<br>
(ii)    Signal to  CTLl, CTL2, CTL3, CTL4  and  CTL5   to  switch<br>
ON/OFF the input voltage of the transformer, voltage to the<br>
video section, CRT  filament section and satellite radio section.<br><br>
(iii)   Signal to control the various circuits of the television.<br>
(iv)    Signal to switch ON/OFF the television power supply (stand-by<br>
light indicator). (V)    Signal to function the features of the sound section. (vi)   Signal to function the features of the satellite radio section. (vii)   Signal to function the features of the terrestrial radio section. (viii) Signal to function the features of the data section.<br>
The output of the television SMPS ( Switch Mode Power Supply) is given as ( a ) Video section [110 V to 120 V DC ], ( b ) Sound section [ 12 V or 20 V DC ], (c ) CRT filament section [ 6.3 V AC ] and (d) Satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data section [ 12 V or 18 V DC].<br>
The power supply of the television without remote control is shown in FIG. 3. From the figure 3, the function of power supply is the same as flie function of power supply as described early in FIG. 1. In fig. 1, the CTLl, CTL2, CTL3, CTL4 and CTL5 are activated by the remote section to switch ON/OFF the different sections. But in FIG. 2 , the switches ( SWl, SW2, SW3, SW4 and SW5 ) are used to switch ON/OFF the input voltage of transformer, voltage to (i) Video section, (iii) CRT filament section and (iv) Satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data section. The switches are manually activated by the user. Therefore the switches are placed as shown in the FIG. 2 wherein CTL'S are placed as shown in FIG. 1. The switching circuit ( CTL2, CTL3 etc.,.) is to be fixed at the place where the required power supply for different sections viz. satellite radio, video section etc.,. is obtained.<br>
From figure. 4, the switching circuit of the television, satellite radio, terrestrial radio, data and external video and audio have inputs of internal television (a) video and (b) Audio; the external (1) audio and (m) video and the satellite radio (e) audio and (k) command from remote section. The output<br><br>
of switching circuit has (c) video and (d) audio. The output of video signal (c) to video amplifier, chroma section and audio signal (d) to sound amplifier. The external video and audio is connected with the VCD, VCP, DVD etc.,. The internal television composite video signal (a) is the output of video detector and the audio signal (b) is the output of sound detector section. The selection of video and audio of television, audio of satellite radio, audio of terrestrial radio, data, external video and audio, commands signal fiow remote section is given as the input of the switching circuit. If the user selects the television, the intemal video and audio of television is connected to the video section (c) and sound amplifier (d) by the switching circuit. If the user selects the satellite radio, the audio signal of the satellite radio section is connected to the sound amplifier (d) by the switching Circuit. If the user selects the terrestrial radio, the audio signal of the terrestrial radio section is connected to the sound amplifier (d) by the switching Circuit, If the user selects the data, the video signal of the data is connected to the video section (c) by the switching circuit. If the AV is selected by the user, the external video and audio is connected to the video section (c) and sound amplifier (d) by the switching circuit as shown in the figure. 4.<br>
The satellite radio section ( f) contains Antenna, LNA (Low Noise Amplifier), Chipset, D/A (Digital to Analog) converter. The Antenna receives the down link frequency from the satellite. The down link frequency is received by the LNA. And the LNA is used to boost the satellite signal. The signal fiow the LNA is received in a chipset. The chipset contains Decoder, Receiver, Time division demultiplexed. Demodulator. The signal from the chipset is the base band digital signal. The digital audio signal is converted to the analog audio signal of satellite radio. Then the audio signal is given to the sound amplifier for further amplification. At the time of functioning of multimedia service viz. slow motion image, mailing, fax etc.,. can be accessed through satellite radio.<br><br>
The terrestrial radio section (h) contains tuner,   The data section ( j ) contains decoder, receiver etc.,. The features of the data broadcasting can be watched on a) Television screen b) LCD screen, when the operation of data broadcasting the video section can be switched *0N' or *OFF' using the 'video' key and the sound section in the television are switched 'OFF' automatically. The power supply which is required for the operation of satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data section is obtained from transformer output ( d ). A switching is placed in between output of power supply and satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data section. The required power supply for the operation of each section is fed through the switching. The transformer is properly designed with required Amperes for operating the different sections.<br>
If the television has the remote control section, the selection of the television, satellite radio, terrestrial radio, data, external video and audio can be operated by the remote control. The selection of the television, satellite radio, terrestrial radio, data, extemal video and audio is operated by the switching circuits is explained above.<br>
If the television has no facility of remote control section, the television audio, satellite radio audio and terrestrial radio audio signal is connected to the sound amplifier section for further amplification of audio signal. If the television is switched *0N*, the satellite radio, terrestrial radio and data is switched 'OFF*, the television audio is amplified by sound amplifier section. If the satellite radio is switched *0N', the television (the tuning voltage of the television tuner is switched OFF by a switching), terrestrial radio and data is switched 'OFF', the satellite radio audio is amplified by sexed amplifier section. If the terrestrial radio is switched 'ON', the television (the tuning voltage of the television tuner is switched OFF by a switching), satellite radio and data is switched 'OFF', the terrestrial radio audio is amplified by sound amplifier section.<br><br>
The audio of satellite midi, terrestrial radio and television is properly matched with tiie sound amplifier section to have the clear quality of audio output.<br>
The sound amplifier and speaker in a television set are used for audio of satellite radio, audio of terrestrial radio and audio of television.<br>
If the Satellite TV programmers viz.,. the B.B.C, Star TV, Discovery channel, CNBC etc.,. are broadcast or provided by the world space or the world space authorised service providers through satellite radio can be watched on the television screen. Therefore the satellite television programmes are broadcast by the world space can be directly received in the television through world space ( satellite radio) receiver.<br>
