Description<br>
PIGMENTED INKJET INK WITH A POLYMERIC DISPERSANT CONTAINING A<br>
LONG ALIPHATIC CHAIN (METH)ACRYLATE<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to stable pigmented inkjet inks with a polymeric dispersant containing a long chain (meth)acrylate.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of cjispersants alsgjjpunteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has'to meet particularly high requirements when used for inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of.'the. pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have a polymer chain which sticks out and whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]   The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Polymeric dispersants obtained by randomly polymerizing monomers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABBAABAB) or by polymerizing alternating monomers<br><br>
(e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into ABABABAB) generally result in a poor dispersion stability. Improvements in dispersion stability were obtained using graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants. Graft copolymer dispersants consist of a polymeric backbone with side chains attached to the backbone.<br>
CA 2157361 (DU PONT) discloses pigment dispersions made by using a graft copolymer dispersant with a hydrophobic polymeric backbone and hydrophilic side chains.<br>
Other graft copolymer dispersants are disclosed in US 6652634 (LEXMARK), US 6521715 (DU PONT) and US 2004102541 (LEXMARK). Block copolymer dispersants containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks have been disclosed in numerous inkjet ink patents.<br>
US 5859113 (DU PONT) discloses an AB block copolymer dispersant with a polymeric A segment of polymerized glycidyl (meth)acrylate monomers reacted with an aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acid, and a polymeric B segment of polymerized alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers having 1-12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylate monomers.<br>
US 6413306 (DU PONT) discloses ABC block copolymer dispersants with a polymeric A segment of polymerized alkyl (meth)acryiate monomers having 1-12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, aryl (meth)acrylate monomers, cycloalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers, a polymeric B segment of polymerized alkyl amino alkyl(meth)acrylate monomers with a quaternized alkyl group, and a polymeric C segment of polymerized hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate monomers.<br>
The design of polymeric dispersants for inkjet inks is discussed in SPINELLI, Harry J.. Polymeric Dispersants in Ink Jet Technology. Advanced Materials. 1998, vol.10, no.15, p.1215-1218. A wide variety of polymeric dispersants has been proposed, but the dispersion stability of pigments, especially in inkjet, still needs further improvement. For consistent image quality, the inkjet ink requires a dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60Â°C) during transport of the ink to a customer and changes in the<br><br>
dispersion medium of the inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of water and increasing concentrations of humectant.  It is highly desirable to be able to manufacture such stable pigmented Inkjet inks using a polymeric dispersant obtained by a simple synthesis, i.e. by randomly polymerizing mongmers.<br>
Objects of the invention  [0010]   It is an object of the present invention to provide pigmented Inkjet inks<br>
using a polymeric dispersant obtained by simple synthesis, exhibiting high dispersion stability and producing images of high image quality with a high optical density.<br>
[0011]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0012]   It has been surprisingly found that pigmented inkjet inks with high stability and high optical density were obtained when the statistical copolymers contained a certain concentration of long aliphatic chain (meth)acrylate .<br>
[0013]   Objects of the present invention have been realized with a pigmented inkjet ink comprising a pigment and a polymeric dispersant wherein the polymeric dispersant is a statistical copolymer comprising between 3 and 11 mol% of a long aliphatic chain (meth)acrylate wherein the long aliphatic chain contains at least 10 carbon atoms.<br>

Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0076]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0077]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengthsrthan the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The<br><br>
dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80Â°C. [0078]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelerigth. The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength. <br>
[0079]  The SSF is an excellent tool to design inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different<br>
inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the<br>
combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over<br>
the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption<br>
spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be<br>
absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these<br>
inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre. EXAMPLES Materials [0080]  All materials used in the following examples were readily available from<br>

1. SSF factor [0082]  The spectral separation factor SSF was calculated as the ratio of the<br>
maximum absorbance Amax (measured at wavelength Amax) over the<br>
absorbance Aref determined at the reference wavelength of Amax+200 nm. [0083]  The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Hewlett Packard<br>
8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted to have a<br>
pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometry measurement of<br>
the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in<br>
transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the<br>
settings of Table 1. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used<br>
and water was chosen as a blank.<br><br><br><br>
[0084]   Efficient pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0085]   The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80Â°C. Pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30 and preferably a % reduction in SSF smaller than 20%.<br>
3.	Polymer analysis<br>
[0086]  All polymers have been characterized with gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Random or block copolymers were analyzed with NMR by dissolving them in a deuterated solvent. For 1H-NMR Â± 20 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCb or DMSO-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D20 (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 MHz instrument equipped with an ID-probe. For 13C-NMR Â± 200 mg polymer was dissolved in 0.8 mL CDCb or DMSO-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 or D2O (with or without NaOD addition). Spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini2000 300 MHz equipped with a SW-probe.<br>
[0087]   Mn, Mw, Mz and polydispersity (pd) values were measured using gel<br>
permeation chromatography. For polymers dissolvable in organic solvents PL-mixed B columns (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) were used with THF+5% acetic acid as mobile phase using polystyrene with known molecular weights as calibration standards. These polymers were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration of 1mg/mL. For polymers dissolvable in water PL Aquagel OH-60, OH-50, OH-40 and/or OH-30 (Polymer Laboratories Ltd) column combinations were used depending on the molecular weight region of the polymers under investigation. As mobile phase water/methanol mixtures adjusted to pH 9.2 with e.g. disodiumhydrogen phosphate were used with or without the addition of neutral salts e.g. sodium nitrate. As calibration standards polyacrylic acids with known molecular weights were used. The polymers were dissolved in<br><br>
either water or water made basic with ammonium hydroxide at a concentration of 1*mg/mL Refractive index detection was used. [0088]   An example is now given to illustrate the calculation of the average composition of a random (= statistical) copolymer P(MAA-c-EHA). The Mn of the copolymer was determined with GPC to be 5000. The molar percentage of each monomer type by NMR was determined to be: 45 mol% MAA and 55 mol% EHA. Calculation:<br>
(0,45 x MMAA) + (0.55 x MEHA) = 140.09<br>
5000 / 140.09 = total number of monomeric units in average polymer chain = 36<br>
Average number of MAA units = 0.45 x (5000/140.09) = 16 units Average number of EHA units = 0.55 x (5000/140.09) = 20 units Thus, the average composition is P(MAAi6-c-EHA2o). 4. Particle size [0089]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvernâ¢ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis. * [0090]  The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet containing 1.5 mL water and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good ink jet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is preferably below 150 nm. EXAMPLE 1 [0091]  This example illustrates the high quality, i.e. a large colour gamut (high<br>
SSF), and the high stability of a pigmented magenta inkjet ink containing a long aliphatic chain (meth)acrylate. Synthesis of statistical copolymers<br><br>
[0092]   Polymeric dispersants POL-1 to POL-8 with different compositions were synthesized. The polymeric dispersants POL-6 to POL-8 contained a long aliphatic chain methacrylate (LCMA).<br><br>
[0093]  The synthesis is exemplified for the polymeric dispersant POL-6, i.e. the statistical copolymer P(AA-c-BuA-c-MMA-c-LCMA). In a 250 ml flask the following ingredients were successively added: 0.10 g WAKOâ¢ V601 initiator, 104.79 g IPA, 14.94 g acrylic acid, 20.33 g butylacrylate, 5.74 g
The characterization of the polymeric dispersant POL-6 using GPC resulted in Mn = 2387 and Mw / Mn = 2.29 and using 13C-NMR the<br><br>
composition was analyzed to consist of: 44 mol% AA, 36 mol% BuA, 15 mol% MMA and 5 mol% LCMA. [0094]   The polymeric dispersants POL-1 to POL-5, POL-7 and POL-8 were prepared in a similar way as described for POL-6 but by using the amounts given by Table 2. The resulting composition of the polymeric dispersant is given by Table 3 and was determined by using 13C-NMR for the polymeric dispersants POL-3, POL-4 and POL-6 to POL-8 and by using 1H-NMR for the polymeric dispersants POL-1, POL-2 and POL-5.<br><br>
[0095]   EDAPLANâ¢ 482 available from MUNZING CHEMIE was used as<br>
polymeric dispersant POL-9. EDAPLANâ¢ 482 contained about 6 mol% of a long aliphatic chain methacrylate (LCMA).<br>
Preparation of the pigmented magenta inkjet ink<br>
[0096]   Each of the pigmented magenta inkjet inks was prepared by the same two steps. In a first step, a concentrated aqueous pigment dispersion was made by mixing the pigment Inkjet Magentaâ¢, the polymeric dispersant and water in a 60 mL flask according to the formulation of Table 4.<br><br><br>
[0097]   Each concentrated aqueous pigment dispersion was subjected to a wet dispersion treatment using a roller mill and 0.04 mm yttrium stabilized zirconium beads YTZâ¢ Grinding Media (available from TOSOH Corp.). The flask is filled to half its volume with the grinding beads and put onto the roller mill. The speed is set at 150 rotations per minute for three days. After milling, the dispersion is separated from the beads using a filter cloth.<br>
[0098]  The concentrated aqueous pigment dispersion served as the basis for the preparation of the pigmented inkjet ink. The inkjet inks were prepared by mixing the components according to the general formulation of Table 5 expressed in weight % based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
i 	-âiâ_â.	1<br>
Evaluation<br>
[0099]   Using the above method, the comparative pigmented inkjet inks COMP-1<br>
to COMP-6 and the inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-3 were<br>
prepared according to Table 6. The spectral separation factor (SSF) was<br>
determined for each sample directly after preparation and was determined<br>
again after a severe heat treatment of 1 week at 80Â°C. The results are<br>
listed in Table 6.<br><br><br><br>
[0100]   From Table 6, it is clear that the comparative pigmented inkjet inks<br>
COMP-1 to COMP-5, prepared with a statistical copolymer free of a long aliphatic chain methacrylate, were low quality inkjet inks. Either the pigmented inkjet ink exhibited a small SSF (less than 30) or otherwise exhibited a high SSF but having no stability after an ageing test of one week at 80Â°C. The inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-3 combined high image quality and high dispersion stability. However, pigmented inkjet inks containing the polymeric dispersant POL-8 with a composition containing more than 10 mol% of decyl methacrylate exhibited again a poor image quality.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0101]   This example illustrates that the polymeric dispersants containing a long aliphatic chain (meth)acrylate not only have excellent dispersion stability but also are less sensitive to changes in the composition of the dispersion medium of the pigmented inkjet ink. These changes can occur when evaporation of volatile components in the inkjet ink is allowed, for example, in an open ink container or at the nozzle plate of the inkjet printhead. 1,2-Hexanediol was used to alter the composition in dispersion medium of the pigmented inkjet ink.<br>
[0102]   The comparative pigmented inkjet inks COMP-7 and COMP-8 and the<br>
inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-4 and INV-5 were prepared by dilution with 5wt% of 1,2-hexanediol of the comparative pigmented inkjet inks COMP-5 and COMP-6 respectively the inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-2 prepared for Example 1.<br>
Evaluation<br><br>
[0103]  The average particle size for each of the comparative pigmented inkjet inks COMP-5 to COMP-8 and the inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1, INV-2, INV-4 and INV-5 were determined and are given by Table 7.<br><br>
[0104]   From Table 7 it is clear that only the inventive pigmented inkjet inks INV-1, INV-2, INV-4 and INV-5 exhibited average particle sizes of the dispersed particles smaller than 150 nm in both dispersion media having low or high concentration of 1,2-hexanediol.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0105]  This example shows a pigmented inkjet ink set wherein inks comprising a polymeric dispersant according to the invention exhibit excellent dispersion quality.<br>
Inkjet ink set<br>
[0106]  The aqueous pigmented inkjet ink set consists of 7 colour inks, i.e. cyan, yellow, magenta and black full density inks, completed with three light density inks, namely light cyan, light magenta and light black inks.<br>
[0107]  The inkjet ink compositions were prepared in the same way as in<br>
EXAMPLE 1 and are the inkjet ink compositions in wt% based on the total weight of the ink are given in Table 8 and Table 9. The dense ink and the light ink of the same colour were obtained from diluting the same concentrated pigment dispersion with different amounts of ink carrier liquid.<br>
[0108]<br><br><br>
1 	I	I	I	I<br>
[0110]  The spectral separation factor (SSF) was determined for each ink of the<br>
ink set. The results are listed in Table 10. [0111] <br>
[0112] The dispersion quality of black inkjet inks was evaluated by particle size measurements. The average particle size measured with a Brookhaven Instruments Particle Sizer BI90plus based upon the principle of dynamic<br><br>
light scattering. The inkjet ink was diluted between 2,000 and 20,000 times<br>
0<br>
and 5 runs at 23Â°0'yvere measured at a 90Â° angle and 635 nm wavelength<br>
with the BI90plus set to graphics = correction function. [0113]   The black pigments were finely divided in both the full density and the light<br>
density black inkjet inks with an average particle size for the Black ink of<br>
81 nm and for the Light Black ink of 84 nm. [0114]   Images printed with the inkjet ink set were of excellent quality.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
