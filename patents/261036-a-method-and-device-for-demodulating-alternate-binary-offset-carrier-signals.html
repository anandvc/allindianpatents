FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to Global Navigation Satellite System<br>
(GNSS) receivers and, in particular, to receivers that operate with Gaileo<br>
alternate binary offset carrier (AltBOC) satellite signals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, such as Galileo receivers,<br>
determine their global position based on signals received from orbiting G'^SS<br>
satellites. The GNSS satellites transmit signals using at least one carrier, -sach<br>
carrier being modulated by at least a binary pseudorandom (PRN) code, Which,<br>
consists of a seemingly random sequence of ones and zeros that is periodically<br>
repeated. The ones and zeros in the PRN code are referred to as "code chips"<br>
and the transitions in the bode from one to zero or zero to one, which occ jr at<br>
"code chip times" are referred to as "code chip transitions". Each GNSS satellite<br>
uses a unique PRN code, and thus, a GNSS receiver can associate a received<br>
signal with a particular satellite by determining which PRN code is included in<br>
the signal.	!<br>
The GNSS receiver calculates the difference between the time a satellite<br>
transmits its signal and the time that the receiver receives the signal. The<br>
receiver then calculates its distance, or "pseudo-range" from the satellite based<br>
on the associated time difference. Using the pseudo-ranges from at least four<br>
satellites, the receiver determines its global position.<br>
To determine the time difference, the GNSS receiver synchronizes a locally<br>
generated PRN code with the PRN code in the received signal by aligning the<br>
code chips in each of the codes. The GNSS receiver then determines how much<br>
the locally-generated PRN code is shifted in time from the known timing of the<br>
satellite PRN code at the time of transmission, and calculates the associated<br>
pseudo-range. The more closely the GNSS receiver aligns the locally-generated<br>
PRN code with the PRN code in the received signal, the more precisely the<br>
GNSS receiver can determine the associated time difference and pseudo-range<br><br>
and, in turn, its global position.<br>
The code synchronization operations include acquisition of the satellite PRN<br>
code and tracking the code. To acquire the PRN code, the GNSS receiver<br>
generally makes a series of correlation measurements that are separated in :ime<br>
by a code chip. After acquisition, the GNSS receiver tracks the received code. It<br>
generally makes "Early-Minus-Late" correlation measurements, ! i.e.<br>
measurements of the difference between (i) a correlation measurement<br>
i<br>
associated with the PRN code in the received signal and an early version of the<br>
locally-generated PRN code, and (ii) a correlation measurement associated with<br>
the PRN code in the received signal and a late version of the local PRN dode.<br>
The GNSS receiver then uses the early-minus-late measurements in a delay tlock<br>
loop (DLL), which produces an error signal that is proportional to| the<br>
misalignment between the local and the received PRN codes. The error signal is<br>
used, in turn, to control the PRN code generator, which shifts the local PRN<br>
code essentially to minimize the DLL error signal.<br>
The GNSS receiver also typically aligns the satellite carrier with a local carrier<br>
using correlation measurements associated with a punctual version of the local<br>
PRN code. To do this the receiver uses a carrier tracking phase lock loop (PLL).<br>
The European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESAJ are<br>
developing a GNSS known as Galileo. Galileo satellites will transmit; two<br>
signals in the E5a band (1176.45 MHz) and two signals in the E5b band<br>
(1207.14 MHz) as a composite signal with-a center frequency of 1191.795 MHz<br>
and a bandwidth of at least 70 MHz, using a AltBOC modulation. | The<br>
generation of the AltBOC signal is described in the document of the Galileo<br>
Signal Task Force of the European Commission "Status of Galileo Frequency<br>
and Signal Design", G. W. Hein, J. Godet, JX. Issler, J.C. Martin, P. Erhaid, R.<br>
Lucas-Rodriguez and T. Pratt, 25.09.2002, published at the following address:<br>
http://europa.eu.mt/comm/dgs/energy_transport/galileo/documents/teclmical_en<br>
.htm. Like the GPS satellites, the Galileo satellites each transmit unique PRN<br>
codes and a Galileo receiver can thus associate a received signal with a<br>
particular satellite. Accordingly, the Galileo receiver determines respective<br>
pseudo-ranges based on the difference between the times the satellites transmit<br>
the signals and then times the receiver receives the AltBOC signals.<br>
A standard linear offset carrier (LOC) modulates a time domain signal by a sine<br><br>
wave sin(a&gt;0t), which shifts the frequency of the signal to both an up/per<br>
sideband and a corresponding lower sideband. The BOC modulation<br>
accomplishes the frequency shift using a square wave, or sign(sin(ffi0t)), and is<br>
generally denoted as BOC(fs, fc), where fs is the subcarrier (square wave)<br>
frequency and fc is the spreading code chipping rate. The factors of 1.023 ftJTHz<br>
are usually omitted from the notation for clarity so a BOC (15.345 MHz, 1(1).23<br>
MHz) modulation is denoted BOC (15,10).	j<br>
i<br>
j<br>
The modulation of a time domain signal by a complex exponential e*"0' shifts<br>
the frequency of the signal to the upper sideband only. The goal of the AltSOC<br>
modulation is to generate in a coherent manner the E5a and E5b bands, which<br>
are respectively modulated by complex exponentials, or subcarriers, suchjthat<br>
the signals can be received as a wideband "BOC-like signal". The E5a and|E5b<br>
bands each have associated in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) spreading, or PKN,<br>
codes, with the E5a codes shifted to the lower sideband and the E5b cbdes<br>
shifted to the upper sideband. The respective E5a and E5b quadrature carriers<br>
are modulated by dataless pilot signals, and the respective in-phase carriers are<br>
modulated by both PKN codes and data signals.	■<br>
I<br>
i<br>
The AltBOC modulation offers the advantage that the E5a (I and Q) and Ei5b (I<br>
and Q) signals can be processed independently as traditional BPSK(10) (Binary<br>
Phase-Shift Keying) signals, or together, leading to tremendous performances in<br>
terms of tracking noise and multipath.<br>
For the derivation of the demodulation principle of the AltBOC modulation, it<br>
is sufficient to approximate the base-band AltBOC signal by its AltLOC<br>
(Alternate Linear Offset Carrier) counterpart:<br><br>
where:<br>
-	ci(t) is the PRN code of the E5b-data component (E5bl) and di(t) is the<br>
corresponding bit modulation;<br>
-	c2(t) is the PKN code of the E5a-data component (E5al) and d2(t) is the<br>
corresponding bit modulation;	j<br>
-	c3(t) is the PKN code of the E5b-pilot component (E5bQ);<br><br>
-	c4(t) is the PEN code of the E5a-pilot component (E5aQ);<br>
-	the exponential factors represent the subcarrier modulation, of E5a and E5b;<br>
-	cos is the side-band offset pulsation: cos = 27i;fs, with fs=15.345 MHz.<br>
In reality, s(t) contains additional product terms and the subcarrier exponentials<br>
are quantized. This effect will not be explicitly included in the equations for the<br>
sake of clarity. s(t) is modulated on the E5 carrier at 1191.795 MHz.<br>
Most previous publications present AltBOC from a satellite payload<br>
perspective, i.e. from a transmitter viewpoint. The receiver side processing has<br>
received very little attention so far.<br>
The publication "Comparison of AWGN Code Tracking Accuracy; for<br>
Alternative-BOC, Complex-LOC and Complex-BOC Modulation Options in<br>
Galileo E5-Band, M. Soellner and Ph. Erhard, GNSS 2003, April 2003,<br>
discloses the principle of a AltBOC receiver architecture for tracking the<br>
AltBOC pilot component, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1, the AltBOC receiver receives over an antenna 1 a signal that includes<br>
AltBOC composite codes transmitted by all of the satellites that are in view.<br>
The received signal is applied to a RF/IF stage 2 that, in a conventional maimer,<br>
converts the received signal RF to an intermediate frequency IF signal that has a<br>
frequency which is compatible with the otiher components of the receiver, falters<br>
the IF signal through a IF band-pass filter that has a band-pass at the desired<br>
center carrier frequency, and samples the filtered IF signal at a rate that satisfies<br>
the Nyquist theorem so as to produce corresponding digital in-phase (T) and<br>
quadrature (Q) signal samples in a known manner. The bandwidth of the'filter<br>
should be sufficiently wide to allow the primary harmonic of the AltBOC<br>
composite pilot code to pass, or approximately 51 MHz. The wide bandwidth<br>
results in relatively sharp code chip transitions in the received code, and!thus,<br>
s<br>
fairly well defined correlation peaks.	j<br>
The AltBOC receiver comprises a local carrier oscillator 4, for example of the<br>
NCO type (Numerically Controlled Oscillator), synchronized with the IF<br>
frequency to generate a phase rotation angle on M bits which is applied to a<br>
phase rotator 3 receiving the IF signal samples on N bits. The phase rotated<br>
signal samples on N bits delivered by the phase rotator are applied to three<br>
complex correlators, each comprising a signal multiplier 10, 11, 12 and an<br><br>
integrator 13, 14, 15. The integrators sum the signal samples received during a<br>
predefined integration time Tint.<br>
The AltBOC receiver further comprises another local oscillator 5 of the TNICO<br>
type synchronized with the code chipping rate fc and which drives a complex<br>
AltBOC code generator 6 for locally generating complex PRN pilot codes for a<br>
given satellite. The generated pilot codes pass through a multi-hit delay line 7<br>
comprising three cells E, P, L producing respectively early, prompt and Tate<br>
replicas of the local PRN codes which are applied respectively to an input of the<br>
multipliers 10,11, 12.<br>
The signals CE, CP and CL delivered by the integrators 13,14, 15 are then used<br>
to generate a carrier phase and code error signals which are used to drive; the<br>
NCO oscillators 4, 5.<br>
I<br>
The AltBOC code generator 6 presents the drawback of being complexj and<br>
multi-bit. Namely, it produces a quantized version of the Alt-LOC base-band<br>
signal (assuming only the pilot component is tracked) in the following form]:<br>
i<br><br>
Such a complex base-band signal is cumbersome to generate. The architecture<br>
shown in Fig. 1 also implies that all the operators (delay line, multipliers^ and<br>
integrators) operate on complex multi-bit numbers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	j<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS ;<br>
The major characteristics of the invention will now be detailed. According to<br>
the AltBOC demodulation principle, the pilot channel is formed by! the<br>
combination of E5aQ and E5bQ signals. The AltBOC pilot signal is composed<br>
of the c3 and c4 components:<br><br>
where cos is the side-band offset pulsation: <x>s = 2n:fs, with fs=15.345 MHz.<br>
In principle each component could be demodulated by correlating sP(t) with the<br>
code chip sequence, c;-sequence, multiplied by the complex conjugate of the<br>
corresponding subcarrier exponential, e.g. to track the c3(t) component^ the<br>
receiver must correlate with c3(t)-e_^tDs +n . The corresponding correlation<br>
function CE5bQ(t) can easily be derived (assuming an infinite bandwidth):<br>
  )<br>
where:	j<br>
-	the sign "<x stands for proportional to></x>
-	triangle(x) = ^ Mile.	,<br>
[0	otherwise	;<br>
-	x is the delay between the mcoming signal and the local code and subcarrier<br>
replicas;<br>
-	Tint is the integration time; and<br>
-	Tc is the chip length in units of time.<br>
The variations of the signal CE5bQ(x) as a function of the code tracking error are<br>
shown in Fig. 2. Curves 17 and 18 are respectively the real (I) and the<br>
imaginary (Q) components of this function, whereas curve 16 is the magnitude<br><br>
thereof. It can be seen that it is a complex function of T: if the local code and<br>
subcarrier replicas axe misaligned, energy moves from the I- to the Q-brahch.<br>
Such a correlation peak cannot be tracked as the code and carrier misalignrrients<br>
are not clearly separated: any code misalignment leads to a carrier phase<br>
tracking error. As the carrier loop is generally much faster than the code lotip, it<br>
will tend to zero the energy in the Q branch, resulting in the code loop seeing a<br>
pure BPSK correlation peak.	j<br>
The additional information needed to make use of the BOC principle is the fact<br>
that the other side-band is coherently transmitted at a frequency distance of<br>
exactly 2fs = CHJTC. The CE5aQ(T) correlation function is given by correlating sP(t)<br>
withc4(t).e^t-'t/2):<br><br>
A Fresnel diagram as plotted in Fig. 3 provides an intuitive view of the complex<br>
QssaqC1) m^ CE5bQ(T) correlations. In this diagram, both correlations are<br>
represented as vectors in the I, Q plane. As the code delay T increases, CE5bQ<br>
and CE5aQ rotate with an angle +©sx and -CDST respectively, and their amplitude<br>
decreases according to the triangle function, leading to the two helixes as shown<br>
in the figure.<br>
A combined correlation peak function can be derived by summing the CE5a<j5 and></j5>
CE5bQ correlations, which corresponds to summing the vectors in Fig. 3: j<br><br>
As represented in Fig. 4, the function CE5Q(T) which corresponds to the AltBOC<br>
correlation peak function is real (curve 36) for all code delays, the imaginary<br>
part (curve 37) being null, and hence can be used for code tracking.	!<br>
I<br>
For the Pilot channel, the combined B5a/E5b correlation peak is simply the sum<br>
i<br>
of the individual E5a and E5b peaks. For the data channel, the same principle<br>
can be used, but the data bits have to be wiped off prior to the combination: the<br>
E5-Data correlation peak is given by:<br><br><br>
This bit estimation process makes the tracking channel less robust, especially at<br>
low signal to noise ratio (C/N0) where the probability of bit error is high.<br>
From this principle, five preferred embodiments of a AltBOC demodulator will<br>
be derived according to the invention. With a clever partitioning between pre-<br>
and post-correlation processing, the base-band processing of AltBOC can be<br>
done with little overhead with respect to traditional BPSK signals.<br>
The AltBOC demodulators presented below are derived assuming the Pilot<br>
channel is tracked, but the extension to the Data channel tracking is<br>
straightforward.<br>
It has been shown that building the AltBOC correlation peak involves<br>
correlating the incoming signal with c3(t)-e~j(c°st+7t/2) and c4(t)-ej(c°Bt"'t/2),<br>
and summing these two complex correlations. In the receiver, this is done in<br>
two identical channels, sharing the same local code and carrier oscillators.<br>
As explained above, demodulation of the c3 component involves correlating the<br>
mcoming signal with c3 (t) • e-J'ffist+,t '. This operation is equivalent to rotkting<br>
the incoming signal by an angle -mst - TC/2, followed by multiplying by the c3<br>
PRN chips and integration. The multiplication by the code chips can be seen as<br>
an additional rotation by 0° if the chip is +1, or by 180° if the chip is -l.jThis<br>
observation leads to the first AltBOC demodulator channel architecture as<br>
represented in Fig. 5.<br>
In Fig. 5, the AltBOC demodulator channel receives over an antenna 1 a signal<br>
that includes the AltBOC composite codes transmitted by all of the satellites<br>
that are in view. The received signal is applied to a RF/IF stage 2 that converts<br>
the received signal RF to an intermediate frequency IF signal having a<br>
frequency which is compatible with the other components of the receiver, filters<br>
the IF signal through a IF band-pass filter that has a band-pass at the desired<br>
center carrier frequency, and samples the filtered IF signal at a rate that satisfies<br>
the Nyquist theorem so as to produce corresponding digital in-phase (Ij) and<br><br>
quadrature (Q) signal samples on N bits in a known manner. The bandwidth of<br>
the filter is sufficiently wide to allow the primary harmonic of the AltBOC<br>
composite pilot code to pass, or approximately 51 MHz. The wide bandwidth<br>
results in relatively sharp code chip transitions in the received code, and thus,<br>
fairly well defined correlation peaks.<br>
The AltBOC demodulator comprises a local oscillator 4, for example of the<br>
i<br>
NCO type (Numerically Controlled Oscillator), synchronized with! the<br>
frequency IF to generate a phase rotation angle on M bits which is applied! to a<br>
phase rotator 3 receiving the IF signal samples on N bits. The phase-rotated<br>
signal samples delivered by the phase rotator 3 are applied in parallel to three<br>
phase rotators 25, 26, 27 before being integrated in three respective integrators<br>
28,29, 30 which sum their input signal samples during the integration time Tint.<br>
The AltBOC demodulator further comprises another local oscillator 5 of the<br>
NCO type synchronized with the code chipping rate fc and generating the jcode<br>
chipping rate and the subcarrier frequency fs = 1.5 fC3 for driving a subcarrier<br>
phase generator 20 and a E5b code generator 21. The output of E5b jcode<br>
generator 21 is connected to a PRN phase detector 22. The subcarrier phase<br>
generator 20 generates the phase of the subcarrier on M bits at the rate fs<br>
provided by the code NCO oscillator 5. The E5bQ code generator 21 generates<br>
the E5bQ code chips (0 or 1) at the rate fc given by the code NCO oscillator 5.<br>
The PRN phase detector translates the code chips (0 or 1) into a phase rotation<br>
angle 0 or TI.<br>
The respective output signals of the subcarrier phase generator and PRN phase<br>
detector are added by an adder 23, the output signal of the adder being a phase<br>
shift signal (real number coded on M bits) controlling a multi-bit delay like 24<br>
with three cells E, P, L producing respectively early, prompt and late replichas of<br>
received PRN codes which are applied as phase shifts respectively to the phase<br>
rotators 25,26,27.<br>
The correlation signals Cnst,-!, CE5b,o and CE5b,i delivered by the integrators 28,<br>
29, 30 are then used as input of discriminators that sense code and carrier phase<br>
rnisahgnments which are used to control the NCO oscillators 4, 5.<br>
The demodulator channel of Fig. 5 presents two main differences with respect<br>
to a traditional AltBOC demodulation channel as shown in Fig. 1:<br><br>
-	the input to the delay-line 7 is a phase shift in the form of a real-valued<br>
signal;	!<br>
-	the multiplication with the chip prior to the integration is replaced by a phase<br>
rotation.	;<br>
While the gate count required for this architecture is smaller than that of the<br>
standard architecture in Fig. 1, it is still large compared to the traditional 1-bit<br>
wide delay line.	!<br>
The architecture described in reference to Fig. 5 can be largely improved by<br>
noting that the E, P and L rotators 25, 26, 27 all rotate at the same frequency,<br>
but with a fixed phase difference. Namely, if the P rotator 26 applies a phase<br>
shift of-a&gt;st - %I2, the E rotator 25 applies a phase shift of-ot)s(t+dTc/2) -j- u/2<br>
and the L rotator 27 of-ffls(t-dTc/2) - n/2, where d is the Early-Late spacihg in<br>
units of chips, and Tc is the chip duration. This constant phase difference of<br>
±cosdTc/2 can be taken out of the integration, and performed at low speed in<br>
post-correlation (after integration).<br>
This leads to the optimized architecture as presented in Fig. 6. Compared ip the<br>
architecture of Fig. 5:<br>
-	each of the three rotators 25, 26, 27 is replaced by a respective Signal<br>
multiplier 33, 34, 35,	:<br>
-	a subcarrier rotator E5bQ 31 is inserted between the output of the carrier<br>
rotator 3 and the respective inputs of the signal multipliers 33, 34, 35;, and<br>
performs a phase rotation by e--1^3 ',<br>
-	the multi-bit delay-line 24 is replaced by a one-bit wide code delay line 32<br>
(the PRN phase detector being removed) and controlled directly by the E5b<br>
code generator 21, and<br>
-	two signal multipliers 36, 37 respectively by e~Jct et e5" are inserted<br>
respectively at the output of the E and L integrators 28 and 30.<br>
The two signal multipliers 36, 37 belong to a low-speed post-correlation;stage<br>
(after integration), whereas the other part of this architecture belongs to ajhigh-<br>
speed pre-correlation stage.<br>
With this architecture, the only additional block with respect to a traditional<br><br>
BPSK demodulator is the subcarrier rotator 31, the phase of which is controlled<br>
by the code NCO oscillator 5. This architecture is mathematically equivalent to<br>
architecture of Fig. 5 if a is set to cosdTc/2. However, other values of a can be<br>
chosen to obtain virtually any other phase shift between the early audi late<br>
replicas.	|<br>
For clarity, the AltBOC demodulator architectures described in reference With<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 only show three complex correlators (early, punctual and late). In<br>
reality, detection of side-lobe tracking may require at least two additional<br>
correlators (very-early and very-late), but this is a straightforward extension of<br>
the structure.	!<br>
Thus the architecture represented in Fig. 5 or 6 can be extended to any nufnber<br>
of correlators. For instance, n early and m late correlators can be used, (each<br>
being feed with a respective cell of a delay line. CE5b)0 corresponds tb| the<br>
prompt correlation. Typically, the early and late correlations are computed [with<br>
a delay of one cell with respect to the prompt correlation, i.e. they correspond to<br>
CE5b,i and CE5b,-i respectively. However, they can be set to any other delay. A<br>
typical application of the additional correlations is the detection of side peak<br>
tracking.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the architecture of one individual channel. In the<br>
AltBOC receiver, two of these channels for the E5 signal (one for E5a and one<br>
for E5b) are put together and the correlations are summed to produce an<br>
AltBOC correlation signal. Such a combined channel derived from1 the<br>
architecture of Fig. 6 is represented in Fig. 7.<br>
In Fig. 7, the architecture comprise a common RF/IF stage 2, carrier rotator 3,<br>
carrier NCO 4 and code NCO 5.<br>
i<br>
Each channel E5a, E5b comprises a subcarrier phase rotator 31a, 3 lib, a<br>
E5a/E5b code generator 21a, 21b feeding a respective delay line 32a, 32b,|three<br>
respective correlators E, P, L, each including a signal multiplier 33a, 34a&gt; 35a,<br>
33b, 34b, 35b and an integrator 28a, 29a, 30a, 28b, 29b, 30b. The early and late<br>
branches of each channel E5a, E5b further comprise two respective signal<br>
multipliers 36a, 37a, 36b, 37b by a factor respectively equal to e_ja and e^. The<br>
subcarrier phase rotator 3 lb performs a phase rotation by e~^c°st+,t ', whereas<br>
the subcarrier phase rotator 3 la performs a phase rotation by eJ
 <br>
Channel E5a further comprises an additional signal multiplier 41a by a factor<br>
equal to -1, inserted between the code NCO 5 and the subcarrier rotator EJ5aQ<br>
31a. The outputs of the two channels are added by three adders 42, 43,, 44<br>
outputting respectively correlation signals CE5,i, CE5,o and CK-I.<br>
I<br>
Extending formulas (4) and (5), it can be derived that the C£5bik and &amp;£Sa,k<br>
correlations are given by the following:	!<br><br>
where a = (BsdTc/2 = 2ixfsdTc/2. The Early-Late spacing d is determined by the<br>
clocking frequency of the delay line 32. Typically, d ranges from 0.1 to 1.<br>
!<br>
For tracking, the receiver uses the CE5;k correlations to build code and carrier<br>
phase discriminators of which the output is proportional to the code and carrier<br>
phase tracking error respectively.<br>
The basis quantity used in the PLL discriminator is the punctual correlation<br>
CE5i0. The basic quantity used in the DLL discriminator is the difference<br>
between the Early and the Late correlations, also referred to as the Eaxly-niinus-<br>
Late correlation, and noted CE53mL. This difference reads:<br><br>
In the special case of d = l/(2fsTc) = 1/(2*15.345/10.23) = 1/3, a equals nil,<br>
and it can be shown that CE5iEmL is proportional to j(CE5a,o - CE5b]o) for Ismail<br>
tracking errors x. This fact leads to a dramatic reduction of the channel<br>
complexity, as only the punctual correlations (CE5a,o and CE5b,o) need to be<br>
I<br>
I<br>
I<br><br>
computed for both the code and carrier tracking.	j<br>
This property can be demonstrated by reworking the expression for CE5)Emj, as<br>
follows, taking into account that <x inserting formulas to into></x>
formula (14) leads to:<br><br>
On the other hand, for small code tracking errors (T«1), j(CE5a,o-CE5b(o) is<br>
simply:<br>
J(CE5a,o -CE5bj0) = j(l-x)[e-ja^ -eJ'm°T] = 2sin(cosT)	(18)<br>
This relation demonstrates that CE5,EmL is proportional to j(CE5ai0 - CE5b0). The<br>
factor (2 - d) is irrelevant as it is purely an amplification factor compensated for<br>
in the discriminator normalization.	J<br>
This lead to an architecture as represented in Fig. 8, which is equivalent to the<br>
architecture of Fig 7 in the case of d = 1/3, though much simpler.<br>
With respect to the architectures of Figs. 6 and 7, this architecture does| not<br>
comprises code delay lines 32a, 32b and have a single correlator for each! E5a<br>
and E5b codes. Each correlator comprises a single signal multiplier 51a, 51b<br>
receiving the output of the corresponding subcarrier rotator E5a and E5b 31a,<br>
31b and the codes from the corresponding E5a and E5b code generator 21a] 21b<br>
and a single integrator 52a, 52b. The output signals CE5a]0 and CE5b)0 of the<br>
integrators 52a, 52b are applied to an adder 63 so as to obtain the punptual<br>
correlation signal CE5|0, and to a comparator 64 and a multiplier by j 65 so jas to<br>
obtain the Early-minus-Late correlation signal CE5iEmL = j(CE5a,o - CE5b,o). It can be seen that this last architecture is extremely simple, as there is only one<br>
correlator needed per channel. Surprisingly, this leads to the conclusion that the<br>
AltBOC demodulator can be implemented very efficiently in terms of \ gate<br>
count, despites its apparent complexity.<br><br>
This last architecture shows that the tracking of the AltBOC signal can be done<br>
without any Early or Late correlator. This surprising result can be intuitiYely<br>
understood by drawing another Fresnel diagram, as in Fig 9. As established<br>
above, the code misalignment x is proportional to the angle q&gt; between the CWo<br>
and the CES^O correlation vectors: cp = 2a&gt;s%. It is also visible on the diagram that<br>
the vector j(CE5aio - CE5b,oX noted "E-L corr" in the diagram, obtained by<br>
subtracting the CE5b)0 vector from the CE5a&gt;o vector, and by rotating the resulting<br>
vector by 90 degrees, is real, and has an amplitude proportional to the angle cp.<br>
This is the fundamental reason why the AltBOC code tracking does not heed<br>
Early and Late code replicas: the code misalignment can be derived solely from<br>
the punctual correlators.	I<br>
Fig. 10. represents a receiver comprising the AltBOC demodulator of Fig. 8,<br>
and PLL (Phase-Lock Loop) and DLL (Delay-Lock Loop) controlling<br>
respectively the carrier NCO 4 and the Code NCO 5.<br>
The PLL comprises a discriminator 71 the output P of which is filtered by a<br>
PLL filter 72 before being applied to a control input of the carrier NCO 4.jThe<br>
PLL discriminator 71 is the arctan discriminator, which consists in computing<br>
the angle of the complex number CE5,o:<br>
P = Angle (CE5,O).	|(19)<br>
The DLL comprises a DLL discriminator receiving the correlation signal<br>
CE5,EmL and a DLL filter 76 connected to a control input of the code NCO 5i<br>
The DLL discriminator is of the type Dot-product power discriminator, which<br>
compute the signal D = Real(CE5;EmL-CE5&gt;0). Thus the DLL discriminator<br>
comprises a complex conjugate function 73 to which the signal CEs,o is applied<br>
and a signal multiplier 74 for multiplying the signals provided by the multiplier<br>
by j 65 and the complex conjugate function 73. The signal D is then obtained by<br>
a function 75 extracting the real part of the complex signal delivered by the<br>
signal multiplier 74.<br>
After some algebraic manipulations, a simplified architecture as representjed in<br>
Fig. 11 can be derived from the architecture of Fig. 10, which requires fewer<br>
operations to compute the same DLL discriminator.	!<br>
According to the discrhriinator of Fig. 10:<br>
D = Real[CE5)EfflL-CE5(0]<br><br><br>
Thus, in Fig. 11, the DLL discriminator comprises a complex conjugate<br>
function 81 to which the correlation signal CE5B,O is applied and a signal<br>
multiplier 82 for multiplying the signal provided by complex conjugate function<br>
and the correlation signal CE5b|0. The signal D is then obtained by a function<br>
ImagO 83 extracting the imaginary part of the complex signal delivered by; the<br>
signal multiplier 82.	i<br>
A further modification of the architecture of Figure 11 would be; the<br>
replacement of the ImagO operator by an Angle() operator (i.e. a block<br>
providing the same functionality as the arctan discriminator 71).<br>
i<br>
The architecture of Figure 11 can be further optimized as shown in Fig. 12 by<br>
noticing that the phase rotation in the carrier rotator 3 followed by the phase<br>
rotation in the subcarriers rotators 31 a, 3 lb can be combined in one single phase<br>
rotation by a phase corresponding to the sum of the carrier and subcarrier<br>
phases.<br>
Thus in Fig. 12, the carrier rotator 3, the two subcarrier rotators 31a, 31b1 and<br>
the multiplier 41a of Fig. 11 are replaced with two phase rotators 92a and 92b<br>
(one for each channel E5a and E5b) receiving the down-converted signal ifrom<br>
the RF/TF stage 2. Besides, the subcarrier phase provided by the code NCO 4 is<br>
added by an adder 93a to the phase provided by the carrier NCO 3\ and<br>
subtracted therefrom by an adder 93b; the addition results being respectively<br>
applied to the phase rotators 92a, 92b of channels E5a, E5b.<br>
The architecture as shown in Fig. 13 can be derived from the previous<br>
architecture by replacing the Code NCO by a more simple NCO 95 delivering<br>
only the code chipping rate fc, and a frequency multiplier 96 by 1.5 applied to<br>
the code chipping rate fc so as to obtain the subcarrier frequency fs which is<br>
applied as input to the adders 93 a, 93b. This requires to duplicate the ctaier<br>
NCO 4, one for each channel E5a, E5b. The carrier frequency tracked b!y the<br>
PLL is applied to the adders 93a, 93b the respective outputs of which drive the<br><br>
carrier NCOs 91a, 91b of the two channels E5a5 E5b, so as to follow | the<br>
respective combined carrier + subcarrier frequencies of the two channels E5a,<br>
E5b.	j<br>
■<br>
I<br>
In this architecture the high-speed pre-correlation stages of E5a and JE5b<br>
channels remain identical. They both comprise a phase rotator 92a, 92b, jtwo<br>
NCOs 91a, 91b, a code generator 21a, 21b and a correlator. Moreover, if} the<br>
code NCO is duplicated so as to have one NCO per channel, each of the high-<br>
speed pre-correlation stages of E5a and E5b channels is identical to a traditional<br>
BPSK (Binary Phase-Shift Keying) channel, which offers great benefits id the<br>
design of a combined AltBOC/BPSK receiver.	Of course, the optimizations performed in the architectures of Figs. 12 and 13<br>
can be as well applied to the architectures of Figs. 5, 6 or 7.	!<br><br>
