METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND<br>
RECEIVING CHANNEL QUALITY INFORMATION IN A<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting<br>
and receiving Channel Quality Information (CQI) in a wireless communication system.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for<br>
transmitting and receiving CQI when a User Equipment (UE) transitions between<br>
reception states.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, wireless communication systems have evolved from voice service to data<br>
service. The evolution of the wireless communication systems is a driving force behind<br>
the increase in the number of subscribers in number and an ever-increasing user<br>
demand for transmission of larger amounts of data. The wireless communication<br>
systems provide services using a variety of multiplexing schemes according to<br>
resource types. In other words, the wireless communication systems are classified<br>
according to their multiplexing schemes. The provisioning of voice service and/or data<br>
service to multiple users by multiplexing is referred to as a multiple access scheme.<br>
Herein, both a multiplexing scheme and a multiple access scheme are referred to as a<br>
multiplexing scheme without distinction between them.<br>
Major multiplexing schemes are Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Code Division<br>
Multiplexing (CDM), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The<br>
most widespread one of them is CDM which can operate in a synchronous or<br>
asynchronous mode. Because CDM relies on codes, limited orthogonal codes lead to<br>
resource shortage. In this context, OFDM has emerged as promising. OFDM is a<br>
special case of Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) in which a serial symbol sequence is<br>
parallelized and modulated to mutually orthogonal subcarriers, i.e. subcarrier channels,<br>
prior to transmission. OFDM, similar to FDM, boasts of optimum transmission<br>
efficiency in high-speed data transmission because it transmits data on sub-carriers,<br>
while maintaining orthogonality among the subcarriers. Efficient frequency use<br>
attributed to overlapping frequency spectrums and robustness against frequency<br>
selective fading and multi-path fading add to the transmission efficiency in high-speed<br>
data transmission.<br>
To exploit the features of OFDM, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) stan-<br>
dardization body has proposed 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) in order to enable<br><br>
high-speed data transmission in OFDM. Aside from the OFDM features, 3GPP LTE<br>
seeks to achieve other goals including network configuration optimization, signaling<br>
optimization, and fast call setup.<br>
Most obstacles to high-speed, high-quality data service in wireless communications<br>
are created by the channel environment. A major channel environment condition that<br>
impedes wireless communications is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).<br>
Besides AWGN, the channel environment becomes poor in view of a fading-incurred<br>
power change of a received signal, shadowing, Doppler effect caused by the movement<br>
of a UE and a frequent change in mobile velocity, and interference from other users<br>
and multipath signals. Accordingly, it is critical to effectively overcome the obstacles<br>
to provide high-speed, high-quality data service.<br>
One of the more significant methods for overcoming fading in the OFDM system is<br>
Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC). AMC adapts a modulation and coding<br>
scheme to a DownLink (DL) channel change. A UE generates CQI of the downlink by<br>
measuring the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of a received signal and feeds back the<br>
CQI to a Node B on the uplink. The Node B estimates the downlink channel state<br>
based on the CQI and selects a modulation and coding scheme according to the<br>
channel state. When the AMC scheme is adopted, the Node B applies a high-order<br>
modulation scheme and a high coding rate in the case of a relatively good channel<br>
state, and a low-order modulation scheme and a low coding rate in the case of a<br>
relatively bad channel state. Compared to a conventional technology relying on fast<br>
power control, the AMC scheme increases the average performance of a system by<br>
increasing adaptability to a time-variant channel environment<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Services in a wireless communication system can be classified into continuous<br>
services such as voice service and discontinuous services such as data service. For the<br>
continuous services, the Node B and the UE keep a data channel connected between<br>
them and, to do so, they retain a predetermined control channel. On the other hand,<br>
maintaining a data channel and a control channel for the discontinuous services results<br>
in resource dissipation. Accordingly, there exists a need for a method for efficiently<br>
using limited resources by adjusting a channel connection state according to a data<br>
flow state.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
An aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is to address at least<br>
the problems and/or disadvantages described herein and to provide at least the<br>
advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for efficiently allocating<br>
resources in a wireless communication system.<br>
Moreover, an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides an<br>
apparatus and method for reducing signaling overhead when a state transition occurs in<br>
a wireless communication system.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a method of a UE for transmitting CQI to an Evolved-Radio Access<br>
Network (E-RAN) in a wireless communication system where, for data transmission<br>
and reception, the UE operates in one of a continuous reception state for continuously<br>
monitoring a channel and a Discontinuous Reception (DRX) state for monitoring the<br>
channel discontinuously, and the E-RAN instructs the UE to enter into one of the<br>
continuous reception state and the DRX state, in which the UE receives from the E-<br>
RAN a DRX application signal indicating transition from the continuous reception<br>
state to the DRX state, transitions to the DRX state, selects CQI report resources from<br>
CQI report resources used before the transition to the DRX state, if the DRX ap-<br>
plication signal does not include CQI report resource reallocation information, and<br>
reports CQI to the E-RAN using the selected CQI report resources.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a method of an E-RAN for receiving CQI from a UE in a<br>
wireless communication system where, for data transmission and reception, the UE<br>
operates in one of a continuous reception state for continuously monitoring a channel<br>
and a DRX state for monitoring the channel discontinuously, and the E-RAN instructs<br>
the UE to enter into one of the continuous reception state and the DRX state, in which<br>
the E-RAN selects a UE to operate in the DRX state, selects CQI report resources<br>
which the UE is to use in the DRX state, allocates, if part of CQI report resources used<br>
for the UE before transitioning to the DRX state are selected as the CQI report<br>
resources, the remaining CQI report resources to other UEs, transmits to the UE a<br>
DRX application signal indicating a transition from the continuous reception state to<br>
the DRX state, and receives CQI from the UE using the selected CQI report resources<br>
after the transitioning to the DRX state.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention, there is provided an apparatus of a UE for transmitting CQI to an E-RAN in<br>
a wireless communication system, in which a signal transceiver receives from the E-<br>
RAN a DRX application signal indicating transition from a continuous reception state<br>
to a DRX state, the continuous reception state being a state where the UE monitors a<br>
channel continuously and the DRX state being a state where the UE monitors the<br>
channel discontinuously, a CQI resource reallocation information interpreter<br>
determines whether the received DRX application signal includes CQI report resource<br><br>
reallocation information, and a resource calculator selects CQI report resources for use<br>
in the DRX state from CQI report resources used before transitioning to the DRX state,<br>
if the DRX application signal does not include the CQI report resource reallocation in-<br>
formation.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention, there is provided an apparatus of an E-RAN for receiving CQI from a UE in<br>
a wireless communication system, in which a DRX manager selects a UE to operate in<br>

tinuously, a CQI report resource reallocation decider determines whether to reallocate<br>
part of CQI report resources used for the UE before transitioning to the DRX state as<br>
CQI report resources for use in the DRX state, a resource manager allocates the<br>
remaining CQI report resources to other UEs, if determining to reallocate part of CQI<br>
report resources used for the UE before transitioning; to the DRX state as CQI report<br>
resources for use in the DRX state, and a signal transceiver transmits to the UE a DRX<br>
application signal indicating transition to the DRX state and receives CQI from the UE<br>
using the reallocated CQI report resources.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
As is apparent from the above description, when a UE transitions between a<br>
continuous reception state and a DRX state in RRC connected mode, information<br>
regarding newly allocated resources is not signaled to the UE in a wireless com-<br>
munication system. Therefore, signaling overhead is reduced and resources are ef-<br>
ficiently allocated.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and elements<br>
are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various<br>
changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without<br>
departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Also, descriptions of well-known<br>
functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.<br>
The channel connection state can be adjusted by transitions between a continuous<br>
channel reception state and a periodic channel reception state based on Discontinuous<br>
Reception (DRX). When a transition occurs between these two states, radio resource<br>
reallocation information can be sent to the UE by signaling, for example, on a control<br>
channel in order to achieve efficient radio resource utilization.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary 3GPP LTE system which is a future-generation mobile com-<br>
munication system under discussion in the 3GPP standardization body, to which the<br>
present invention is applied, as a substitute for a 3G mobile communication standard, a<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS).<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a UE 110 is a 3GPP LTE terminal. An Evolved-Radio Access<br>
Network (E-RAN) 140 performs the functions of a Node B and a Radio Network<br>
Controller (RNC) of the conventional 3GPP system. The Node B is a radio device that<br>
directly participates in communications with a UE and manages cells. The RNC<br>
controls a plurality of Node Bs and radio resources. As with the conventional 3GPP<br>
system where the Node B and the RNC are configured as separate nodes, the E-RAN<br>
140 can be configured as separate physical nodes, i.e. an Evolved-Node B (E-NB) 120<br>
and an Evolved-RNC (E-RNC) 130, or can merge the E-NB 120 and the E-RNC 130<br>
therein. Herein, the E-NB 120 and the E-RNC 130 are physically merged into the E-<br>
RAN 140. Yet, the following description also holds true in the former case.<br>
An Evolved-Core Network (E-CN) 150 can be a node combining a Serving General<br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and a Gateway GPRS Support<br>
Node (GGSN) of the conventional 3GPP system. The E-CN 150, which is located<br>
between a Packet Data Network (PDN) 160 and the E-RAN 140, allocates an Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) address to the UE 110 and functions as a gateway that connects the UE<br><br>
110 to the PDN 160. For the definitions and functionalities of the SGSN and the<br>
GGSN, refer to www.3GPP.org. While the 3GPP LTE system illustrated in FIG. 1 will<br>
be referred to as an example of an OFDM wireless mobile communication system, it is<br>
to be understood that the present invention is also applicable to any other OFDM<br>
system.<br>
The 3GPP standardization body defines two UE states, a Radio Resource Control<br>
(RRC) idle mode and an RRC connected mode. RRC is a control-plane layer in the E-<br>
RAN, for exchanging radio access-related control information between the UE and the<br>
E-RAN. In the RRC idle mode, the E-RAN does not have RRC context information<br>
about the UE and no control channel (i.e. no RRC connection) exists between the UE<br>
and the E-RAN. The RRC connected mode is a UE mode in which a control channel is<br>
established between the UE and the E-RAN and the E-RAN has the RRC context in-<br>
formation about the UE.<br>
The 3GPP LTE system can set a DRX period according to the activity level of the<br>
UE in the RRC connected mode. If data flows frequently occur for the UE, the UE<br>
continuously receives a channel. If few data flows are generated, a DRX period is set<br>
and the UE is allowed to receive the channel only during the DRX period without con-<br>
tinuously receiving the channel. The use of DRX for the RRC connected mode-UE<br>
serves the purpose of efficient power use in the UE.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an operation for reconfiguring CQI report resources for a UE when<br>
the UE transitions from a continuous channel reception state to a DRX channel<br>
reception state in the RRC connected mode.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 201 denotes a UE and reference numeral 202<br>
denotes an E-RAN. The UE 201 transitions from the RRC idle mode to the RRC<br>
connected mode in step 211. As a result, a control channel is established between the<br>
UE 201 and the E-RAN 202 and the E-RAN 202 has RRC context information about<br>
the UE 201. CQI report resources are notified to the UE 201 by separate signaling in<br>
step 211 or step 212. Information about the CQI report resources includes information<br>
about time-frequency resources, information about the start point of a CQI report, and<br>
a CQI report cycle. In steps 221, 222 and 223, the UE 201 reports CQI in CQI radio<br>
resources allocated in step 211 or step 212 in every CQI report cycle notified in step<br>
211 or step 212.<br>
If the E-RAN 202 decides to set a DRX period for the UE 201 according to the<br>
activity level of the UE 201, E-RAN 202 notifies the UE 201 of DRX application and<br>
in step 231 signals to the UE 201 CQI report resource reallocation information in<br>
relation to the DRX application. The UE 201 in step 241 reports CQI using CQI radio<br>
resources, a CQI report cycle, and a CQI report start point in the CQI report resource<br>
reallocation information. If the E-RAN 202 decides to release the DRX application<br><br>
from the UE 201, the E-RAN 202 in step 251 notifies the UE 201 of the DRX release<br>
and signals CQI report resource reallocation information in relation to the DRX<br>
release. The UE 201 reports CQI using CQI radio resources, a CQI report cycle, and a<br>
CQI report start point in the CQI report resource reallocation information in steps 261,<br>
262 and 263. Typically, the E-RAN 202 decides on DRX application in the absence of<br>
a data flow with the UE 201 and decides on non-application of DRX in the presence of<br>
an active data flow with the UE 201.<br>
As described above, each time the UE applies DRX or releases DRX according to its<br>
activity level, CQI report resource reallocation information should be signaled to the<br>
UE. If DRX is applied to a plurality of UEs in a cell and is released from them, CQI<br>
report resource reallocation information should be signaled to the UEs upon each<br>
transition between DRX application and DRX release, thereby causing a large<br>
signaling overhead.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention define a rule for deriving CQI<br>
report resource information for use during DRX using CQI report resource information<br>
used before DRX application and DRX cycle information, instead of signaling CQI<br>
report resource reallocation information, when a UE transitions between DRX ap-<br>
plication and DRX release. According to the rule, the UE and an E-RAN can con-<br>
sistently maintain/manage CQI report resource reallocation information implicitly<br>
without explicit signaling.<br>
While the present invention is described in the context of a 3GPP LTE system under<br>
discussion in the 3GPP as an exemplary mobile communication system, it is to be<br>
clearly understood that the present invention is also applicable to other mobile com-<br>
munication systems.<br>
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the rule, when the UE transitions<br>
from a DRX release period to a DRX application period, the E-RAN retains a CQI<br>
report resource info context indicating CQI report resources allocated before the DRX<br>
application, and allocates to the UE CQI report resources used shortly before the DRX<br>
application when applying the context using DRX cycle information. Hence, CQI<br>
report resources of the UE previous to the allocated CQI report resources can be re-<br>
allocated to other users.<br>
For example, if DRX starts at a System Frame Number (SFN) of 200, a DRX cycle is<br>
100 SFNs (i.e. the UE wakes up at SFNs of 300,400, etc.), and a CQI report resource<br>
info context indicating CQI report resources used just before the DRX application is<br>
used, the E-RAN allocates CQI report resources used at SFNs of 290, 390, 490, etc., to<br>
the UE during DRX and may allocate resources for CQI report used for the UE at the<br>
other SFNs, in the case where CQI is supposed to be reported using time-frequency<br>
radio resources allocated at SFNs of 210, 230, 250, 270 and 290. Hence, radio<br><br>
resources can be efficiently utilized. If DRX application is signaled to the UE, the CQI<br>
report resource info context indicating CQI report resources used before the DRX ap-<br>
plication is preserved and the UE reports CQI using the CQI report resources previous<br>
to the DRX application, when the context is applied using DRX cycle information. In<br>
the above example, the UE reports CQI using the CQI report resources allocated only<br>
at the SFNs of 290, 390 and 490 before the DRX application.<br>
If the DRX is released, the E-RAN and the UE reuse the CQI report resource info<br>
context indicating CQI report resources used during a DRX release period, stored<br>
before the DRX application, after the DRX release.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the above implicit CQI report resource<br>
allocation method can be used together with the explicit signaling-based CQI report<br>
resource allocation method illustrated in FIG. 2. Thus, if CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information is included in signaling regarding DRX application/release, CQI<br>
is reported according to the CQI report resource real location information. If the CQI<br>
report resource reallocation information is not included in the signaling regarding DRX<br>
application/release, CQI is reported according to the above-described rule.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an operation for reconfiguring CQI report resources for a UE when<br>
the UE transitions between a DRX state and a continuous reception state in an RRC<br>
connected mode.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, reference numeral 301 denotes a UE and reference numeral 302<br>
denotes an E-RAN. The UE 301 in step 311 transitions from RRC idle mode to RRC<br>
connected mode. As a result, a control channel is established between the UE 301 and<br>
the E-RAN 302 and the E-RAN 302 has RRC context information about the UE 301.<br>
The E-RAN 302 allocates CQI report resources to the UE 301 in step 312. Information<br>
about the allocated CQI report resources are sent to the UE 301 by separate signaling<br>
in step 311 or step 312. The CQI report resource allocation information includes in-<br>
formation about time-frequency resources, information about the start point of a CQI<br>
report, and a CQI report cycle. In steps 321, 322 and 323, the UE 301 reports CQI to<br>
the E-RAN 302 in the allocated CQI radio resources according to the CQI report cycle.<br>
If the E-RAN 302 decides to apply DRX for the UE 301 according to the activity<br>
level of the UE 301, in step 331 the E-RAN 302 preserves a CQI report resource info<br>
context indicating CQI report resources allocated in step 311 or step 312, and allocates<br>
the CQI report resources used just before the DRX application using the CQI report<br>
resource info context and DRX cycle information, while reallocating the other CQI<br>
report resources used before the DRX application to other users, for signaling or data<br>
transmission. That is, the original CQI report resources allocated to the UE 301 before<br>
the DRX application and a DRX cycle are calculated and the CQI report resources<br>
used just before the DRX application are maintained for the UE 301, while the other<br><br>
CQI report resources are reallocated to other users. Consequently, radio resources are<br>
efficiently utilized.<br>
For example, if DRX starts at an SFN of 100 and a DRX cycle is 100, the UE wakes<br>
up at SFNs of 100, 200, 300, etc, for data reception. If CQI is supposed to be reported<br>
at SFNs of 110, 130, 150, 170, 190, 210, 230, 250, 270, 290, 310, etc. using allocated<br>
time-frequency radio resources according to a CQI report resource info context used<br>
before DRX application, the E-RAN 302 maintains for the UE 301 the CQI report<br>
radio resources allocated at the SFN 190 just before the SFN 200 and the CQI report<br>
radio resources allocated at the SFN 290 just before the SFN 300, while reallocating<br>
the other CQI report radio resources allocated at the SFNs 110, 130, 150, 170, 210,<br>
230, 250, 270, 310, etc. to other users. In the above example, Connection Frame<br>
Numbers (CFNs) may substitute for SFNs. The SFNs and CFNs may comply with<br>
3GPP standards.<br>
In step 332, the E-RAN 302 notifies the UE 301 of the DRX application by<br>
signaling. In accordance with the resource reallocation method of the present<br>
invention, there is no need for including CQI report resource reallocation information<br>
in the signaling because the E-RAN 302 and the UE 301 have agreed on CQI report<br>
resources for use in DRX. In step 333, the UE 301 preserves a CQI report resource info<br>
context indicating CQI report resources allocated in step 311 or step 312 and reports<br>
CQI in the CQI report resources used just before the DRX application according to the<br>
CQI report resource info context and DRX cycle information, considering that the<br>
other previous CQI report resources are not used for the UE 301. That is, the original<br>
CQI report resources allocated to the UE 301 before the DRX application and a DRX<br>
cycle are calculated and the CQI report resources used just before the DRX application<br>
are maintained for the UE 301, while the other CQI report resources are reallocated to<br>
other users.<br>
For example, if DRX starts at an SFN of 100 and a DRX cycle is 100, the UE wakes<br>
up at SFNs of 100,200, 300, etc. If CQI is supposed to be reported at SFNs of 110,<br>
130, 150, 170, 190, 210, 230, 250, 270, 290, 310, etc. using allocated time-frequency<br>
radio resources according to a CQI report resource info context used before DRX ap-<br>
plication, the UE 301 reports CQI using the CQI report radio resources allocated at the<br>
SFN 190 and the SFN 290, considering that the other CQI report radio resources<br>
allocated at the SFNs 110, 130, 150, 170, 210, 230, 250, 270, 310, etc. are not used for<br>
the UE 301 any longer. In this example, CFNs may substitute for SFNs. The SFNs and<br>
CFNs may comply with 3GPP standards.<br>
In step 334, the UE 301 applies DRX and reports CQI to the E-RAN 302 using CQI<br>
report resources used just before the DRX application, which are calculated using a<br>
CQI report resource info context used before the DRX application and the DRX cycle<br><br>
information.<br>
If the E-RAN 302 decides to release the UE 301 from the DRX mode, in step 341<br>
341reallocates the CQI report resources allocated in step 311 or step 312 before the<br>
DRX application according to the CQI report resource info context preserved since<br>
step 331. In step 342, the E-RAN 302 notifies the UE 301 of the DRX release. When<br>
the implicit CQI report allocation method of the present invention is used, there is no<br>
need for sending CQI report resource reallocation information to the UE 301 in step<br>
342 because the E-RAN 302 and the UE 301 have agreed on CQI report resources for<br>
use in the case of the DRX release. If receiving in step 342 a signal indicating the DRX<br>
release, the UE 301 reports CQI using the CQI report resources allocated in step 311 or<br>
step 312 before the DRX application after the DRX release in steps 344, 345 and 346.<br>
Here, the CQI report cycle is identical to that of CQI reports in steps 321, 322 and 323.<br>
While not shown in FIG. 3, the present invention can be used in combination with a<br>
conventional method. That is, if CQI report resource reallocation information is<br>
explicitly signaled in step 332 or step 342, the UE 301 reports CQI according to the<br>
CQI report resource reallocation information. If the report resource reallocation in-<br>
formation is not signaled in step 332 or step 342, the UE 301 reports CQI according to<br>
the CQI report resource reallocation rule between the UE 301 and the E-RAN 302.<br>
In this way, when the UE transitions between a continuous channel reception state<br>
and a DRX state in the RRC connected mode, the UE can report CQI according to the<br>
defined CQI report resource reallocation rule without the overhead of signaling new<br>
CQI report resource reallocation information.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the UE according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated case of FIG. 4, the present<br>
invention is used in combination with the conventional explicit CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, in step 401 the UE receives from the E-RAN a signal indicating<br>
DRX application, and in step 402determines whether CQI report resource reallocation<br>
information is included in the signal. In the presence of the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information, the UE reports CQI according to the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information in step 411. In the absence of the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information, in step 421 the UE maintains a CQI report resource info context<br>
used before receiving the signal indicating the DRX application and calculates CQI<br>
report resources allocated just before the DRX application. The UE considers that only<br>
the calculated CQI report resources are for a CQI report and the other CQI report<br>
resources are invalid. In step 422, the UE reports CQU using the valid CQI report<br>
resources.<br>
During the DRX, DRX release is instructed to the UE by the E-RAN in step 451. The<br><br>
UE in step 452 determines whether CQI report resource reallocation information is<br>
included in the signaling of step 451. In the presence of the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information, in step 461 the UE reports CQI according to the CQI report<br>
resource reallocation information. In the absence of the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation information, in step 471 the UE considers that the CQI report resources used<br>
before the DRX application are valid and in step 472 reports CQI using the preserved<br>
CQI report resource info context.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the E-RAN according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated case of FIG. 5, the<br>
CQI report resource reallocation method of the present invention is used together with<br>
the conventional CQI report resource reallocation method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in step 501 the E-RAN decides to apply DRX to a particular UE.<br>
In general, if a data flow to/from the UE does not temporarily exist, DRX is applied to<br>
the UE. In step 502, the E-RAN determines whether to apply the present invention to<br>
the conventional method. In the latter case, the E-RAN explicitly includes CQI report<br>
resource reallocation information in step 511. In the former case, in step 521 the E-<br>
RAN preserves a CQI resource info context indicating CQI report resources allocated<br>
to the UE before the DRX application and continues allocating the CQI report<br>
resources to the UE according to DRX cycle information and the context, while re-<br>
allocating the other CQI report resources used for thes UE to other users. In step 522,<br>
the E-RAN does not include CQI report resource reallocation information. In step 531,<br>
the E-RAN signals DRX application to the UE.<br>
In step 551, the E-RAN decides to release the UE from the DRX state. The E-RAN<br>
in step 552 determines whether to use the preserved CQI report resource info context<br>
to reallocate CQI report resources. If it is determined to reallocate CQI report resources<br>
irrespective of the context, in step 561 the E-RAN explicitly includes CQI report<br>
resource reallocation information for use after the DRX release. If it is determined to<br>
reallocate CQI report resources using the context, the E-RAN in step 571 uses the<br>
context and in step 572 does not include CQI report resource reallocation information.<br>
In step 581, the E-RAN signal the DRX release to the UE.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of the UE according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the illustrated case of FIG. 6, the present invention is used in<br>
combination with the conventional explicit CQI report resource reallocation method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a signal transceiver 601 receives a signal from the E-RAN or<br>
sends to the E-RAN a signal including, for example, a CQI report. A DRX manager<br>
611 determines whether a signal received from the signal transceiver 601 indicates that<br>
the E-RAN has instructed DRX application or DRX release and manages related DRX<br>
cycle information. A CQI report resource reallocation info interpreter 621 determines<br><br>
whether the signal indicating DRX application or DRX release explicitly includes CQI<br>
report resource reallocation information. If the signal indicating DRX application or<br>
DRX release explicitly includes CQI report resource allocation information, the CQI<br>
report resource reallocation info interpreter 621 reports CQI according to the explicit<br>
CQI report resource reallocation information.<br>
If the signal indicating DRX application or DRX release does not explicitly include<br>
the CQI report resource reallocation information, a CQI report resource calculator 641<br>
calculates CQI report resources for the UE using a CQI report resource info context<br>
used before DRX application, received from a CQI report resource context manager<br>
631 and DRX cycle information received from the DRX manager 611. If the signal<br>
received from the signal transceiver 601 indicates the DRX application, only CQI<br>
report resources used just before the DRX application from among previous CQI report<br>
resources before the DRX application will be used. If the signal indicates the DRX<br>
release, CQI is reported with the CQI report resources used before the DRX ap-<br>
plication.<br>
A CQI measurer 651 measures CQI and signals CQI on the uplink through the signal<br>
transceiver using the CQI report resources indicated by the CQI report resource re-<br>
allocation info interpreter 621.<br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of the E-RAN according to an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In the illustrated case of FIG. 7, the present invention is used in<br>
combination with the conventional explicit CQI report resource reallocation method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a data flow measurer 701 measures the data flow of the UE. A<br>
DRX manager 711 determines whether to apply or release DRX for the UE according<br>
to the data flow measurement and when it is determined to apply DRX, the data flow<br>
measurer 701 sets DRX cycle information. A CQI report resource reallocation decider<br>
731 determines whether to use a CQI report resource info context for the UE before<br>
DRX application or to reallocate new CQI report resources. If the CQI report resource<br>
reallocation decider 731 decides to allocate new CQI report resources, CQI report<br>
resource reallocation information is explicitly included in a signal indicating DRX ap-<br>
plication or DRX release. If the CQI report resource reallocation decider 731 decides<br>
to reuse the CQI report resource info context, the CQI report resource reallocation in-<br>
formation is not included in the signal indicating DRX application or DRX release. If<br>
the CQI report resource info context is reused and a signal received from the DRX<br>
manager 711 indicates DRX application, a signal transceiver 741 preserves CQI report<br>
resources used just before the DRX application, received from a CQI report resource<br>
calculator 751 and the DRX cycle information received from the DRX manager 711<br>
and receives a CQI report from the UE in the preserved CQI report resources. Other<br>
CQI report resources before the DRX application than the CQI report resources just<br><br>
before the DRX application can be reallocated to other UEs. If the CQI report resource<br>
info context is reused and the signal received from the DRX manager 711 indicates<br>
DRX release, the signal transceiver 741 receives a CQI report from the UE using the<br>
CQI report resource info context after the DRX release.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention thereof, it will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein<br>
