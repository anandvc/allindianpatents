BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mixed liquid supplying apparatus which supplies fuel oil comprising a mixture of two liquids such as gasoline and oil to a vehicle having a two-cycle engine for example.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As fuel oil for a two-cycle engine mounted onto a compact car or a motorcycle, a mixed liquid of gasoline and oil has heretofore been used in some cases, and there have been a vehicle having two fuel tanks for the gasoline and oil, and a vehicle having only one fuel tank for this mixed liquid. As an oil feeding apparatus for the vehicle having the only fuel tank for the mixed liquid, there are an oil feeding apparatus which dispenses the mixed oil from a tank in which the mixed oil is previously reserved, and an oil feeding apparatus which has two tanks for the gasoline and oil and which mixes and dispenses two liquids at the time of refueling. In this type of oil feeding apparatus, a pump for supplying the gasoline, and a pump for supplying the oil are driven by a motor, and the respective pumps are coupled via a belt or the like and driven, or independently driven.<br>
However, in the oil supplying apparatus which mixes and dispenses the gasoline and oil, it has heretofore been difficult to grasp a state in a case where the oil pump breaks down for some cause, or the belt for driving the pump is cut and any oil is not supplied. Therefore, a quality level of the fuel oil cannot be secured in some cases. There is a possibility that only gasoline which is not mixed with any oil is sold, but expenses of oil are falsely charged, and customers incur damages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above circumstances, and it is an object of the invention to provide a mixed liquid supplying apparatus capable of detecting troubles of oil which is one liquid by a pump and the like,<br><br><br>
securing a quality level of mixed fuel oil, and preventing damages from being caused with respect to customers.<br>
To achieve the above object, a first aspect of the present invention provides a mixed liquid supplying apparatus comprising: a first supplying mechanism in which a liquid supply pump and a first flowmeter are interposed in a first liquid supply pipe being in communication with a first tank reserving a first liquid therein and in which a liquid-supply hose provided at its tip end with a liquid-supply nozzle is connected to the first liquid supply pipe and in which a dispensing value of the first flowmeter is indicated in an indicator; and a second supplying mechanism in which a pump and a second flowmeter associatlvely connected to the first flowmeter are interposed in a pipe being in communication with a second tank reserving a second liquid therein and in which a hose is connected to the pipe and in which an end portion of the hose is brought into communication with a first liquid passage of the liquid-supply hose or the liquid-supply nozzle, wherein the second supplying mechanism comprises: a liquid pressure detection device which detects a pressure of the liquid supplied from the pump; and a control device which receives a detection signal of the liquid pressure detected by this liquid pressure detection device to perform an error process. The liquid pressure detection device is disposed in the passage through which one liquid is supplied, an on/off operation of a switching section by the pressure of the circulating liquid is detected, and a trouble is judged to thereby perform the error process, for example, stopping of oil supply. Therefore, the trouble of the pump for supplying the liquid/oil can be detected, quality level of the fuel oil can be secured, and damages are prevented from being brought to any customer.<br>
In the present invention, the liquid pressure detection device comprises: a switch operation mechanism which operates by the liquid pressure; and a switch section which turns on/off by the switch operation mechanism in a case main body section in which the liquid passage is formed. The liquid pressure detection device is capable of detecting a fluctuation of the liquid pressure as an on/off signal.<br><br><br>
In the present invention, the control device detects an error operation by the liquid pressure detection after elapse of time until stabilized operation is obtained at the start of liquid supply. Since the control device detects the error operation after the elapse of time until the stabilized operation is obtained at the start of the liquid supply, the detection operation can be precisely performed.<br>
In the present invention, the control device detects, as a trouble, that a certain off-time continues during oil supply after the start of the liquid supply. Since it is judged as the trouble that the certain off-time continues, the precise error detection is possible without judging, as the trouble, an off-time which easily occurs in normal oil supply.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
An illustrated embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter in more detail. FIGS. 1 to 6 are diagrams showing a mixed liquid supplying apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 1 is a diagram showing a configuration of the mixed liquid supplying apparatus, FIG. 2 is a front view of the liquid supplying apparatus, FIG. 3 is a front view of an oil pressure detection device. FIG. 4 is an A-A line sectional view of the oil pressure detection device, FIG. 5 is a B-B line sectional view of the oil pressure detection device of FIG. 3, and FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing an error detecting operation in a control device of the mixed liquid supplying apparatus.<br>
In these drawings, a mixed liquid supplying apparatus 10 of the present embodiment is, for example, a ground-based apparatus, and comprises, in a main body case 11 thereof, a first supplying mechanism 20 for supplying gasoline which is a first liquid, for example, in two divided systems, a second supplying mechanism 30 for supplying oil which is a second liquid similarly in two divided systems, an oil pressure detection device 50 which detects a supply pressure of the oil, a control device 60 which detects an error based on a pressure detected by the oil pressure detection device 50 and which controls sections of the apparatus and the like.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the main body case 11 comprises a lower case 12 in which the first and second supplying mechanisms 20, 30, the oil pressure detection device 50 and the like are accommodated, an upper case 13 in which the control device 60 for controlling various portions is accommodated, and a top case 14 provided between upper end portions of columns provided on left and right portions of the lower case 12 and the upper case 13. Liquid-supply hoses 15 for supplying gasoline which is the first liquid are hung from the top case 14 on front<br><br><br>
and rear surfaces of the case. Each of the liquid- supply hoses 15 is provided at its tip end with a liquid-supply nozzle 16. The liquid-supply hose is connected to the first supplying mechanism 20 in the lower case 12 through a pipe. The liquid-supply nozzles 16 are hung on nozzle holders 18 provided on the front and rear surfaces of the lower case 12. In this embodiment, the same main body case 11 has a liquid supplying mechanism (right portion in FIG. 2) capable of supplying gasoline only. Hoses 43 for supplying oil which is a second liquid are hung from the top case 14 along the liquid-supply hoses 15 on the front and rear surfaces of the case. Each of the hoses 43 is connected to the second supplying mechanism 30 in the lower case 12 through a pipe. An end portion of the hose 43 is in communication with the liquid-supply hose 15 upstream of the liquid-supply nozzle 17 through a check valve 17. An indicator 62 for displaying a liquid supply amount is provided at an upper portion of the front surface of the upper case 13. Furthermore, an operation panel 61 for varying a mixing ratio of the oil to the gasoline by manual operation is disposed downstream in the vicinity of the nozzle holder 18. It is to be noted that the present applicant filed an application concerning a technique of the mixing ratio variable mechanism 41 (Application No. 1080/ MUM/ 2002).<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, in the first supplying mechanism 20, a first liquid supply pipe 21 connected to a first underground tank reserving the gasoline which is the first liquid therein is connected to a liquid supply pump 23 driven by a motor 22. A pipe on the side of a discharge port of the liquid supply pump 23 is branched halfway into two systems, and connected to a first flowmeter 25 (25) having a flow rate pulse transmitter via a flow rate control valve 24 (24). The first flowmeter 25 (25) on the side of the discharge port is connected to the top case 14 via a pipe. The pipe is led outside front and rear surfaces of the case, and an end portion of the pipe is connected to the liquid-supply hose 15 (15). A flow rate pulse of the flow rate pulse transmitter is counted by the control device 60, and the liquid supply amount is indicated in the indicator 62.<br><br><br>
In the second supplying mechanism 30, a pipe 35 communicating with a second tank 31 disposed in the lower case 12 reserving the oil which is the second liquid therein is connected to an oil pump 40 driven by the motor 22 via a switching valve 39. The tank 31 is provided with a level detector 32 which detects an oil level and which has an upper level sensor 33 and a lower level sensor 34. A detection signal from the level detector 32 is transmitted to the control device 60. For example, when the oil level is detected by the lower level sensor 34, a lamp 63 disposed in the operation panel 61 is lit to thereby warn that the oil of the tank 31 has been reduced. A pipe of the oil pump 40 on the side of a discharge port is branched halfway into two systems via the oil pressure detection device 50, and further connected to a second flowmeter 42 (42) via the mixing ratio variable mechanism 41 (41). The second flowmeter 42 (42) on the side of the discharge port is connected to the top case 14 via a pipe. The pipe is guided outside the front and rear surfaces of the case, and an end portion of the pipe is connected to the hose 43 (43). The hose 43 (43) is connected to the liquid-supply nozzle 16 via the check valve 17 as described above so that the oil is mixed with the gasoline, and can be supplied. The switching valve 39 is connected to a second liquid supply pipe 36 connected to the underground tank reserving the oil which is the second liquid therein, and the second liquid supply pipe 36 is provided with a filter 37 and a check valve 38. That is, when the switching valve 39 is switched, the oil of the tank 31 or the underground tank is selectively usable. It is to be noted that the second flowmeter 42 (42) comprises a switching valve which operates in conjunction with the corresponding first flowmeter 25 (25) via a gear or the like to thereby switch passage. A piston reciprocates/moves in a cylinder by the pressure of the oil which is the second liquid flowing through the passage switched by the switching valve to thereby dispense the liquid.<br>
The oil pressure detection device 50 detects the pressure of the oil supplied from the oil pump 40 of the second supplying mechanism 30, and branches the oil into two systems to thereby supply the oil to the second flowmeters 42, 42. The oil pressure detection device 50 comprises: a case main body section 51 in which an oil passage is formed and in which a switch operation mechanism 65 operating by the oil pressure<br><br><br>
is disposed; a cover section 52 attached in such a manner as to cover the side surface of the case main body section 51 provided with the switch operation mechanism 65; a switch section 59 attached to the side surface of the cover section 52 and the like.<br>
The case main body section 51 is entirely formed, for example, of a metal material into a substantially rectangular block shape. An inflow port 51a connected to the pipe of the oil pump 40 on the side of the discharge port is formed in one end face (see FIG. 4) of the case main body section 51, and an inlet-side passage communicating with the inflow port 51a is formed substantially up to a middle portion of the case main body section 51. Further in the case main body section 51, outflow ports 51b, 51b connected to the pipes communicating with the second flowmeters 42, 42 are formed in two end faces (see FIG. 5) crossing the end face, at right angles, in which the inflow port 51a is formed. Moreover, an outlet-side passage is formed in such a manner as to extend between these outflow ports 51b, 51b and intersect with the inlet-side passage in the middle portion. That is, in the case main body section 51, the inlet-side passage having the inflow port 51a is formed in such a manner as to intersect with the outlet-side passage branched into two substantially in the middle portion and having the outflow ports 51b, 51b. Moreover, in the case main body section 51, a pressure detection hole 51c (see FIG. 5) is formed facing a portion in which the inlet-side passage intersects with the outlet-side passage. The switch operation mechanism 65 is disposed in the end face of the case main body section 51 in which the pressure detection hole 51c is formed.<br>
The switch operation mechanism 65 comprises: a piston section 54 inserted in the pressure detection hole 51c and slidably operating by the oil pressure; a bearing portion 56 disposed in the pressure detection hole 51c and slidably supporting the piston section 54; a ring portion 57 which supports the bearing portion 56; a holding portion 53 which supports the piston section 54 and which fixes the ring portion 57; a spring 58 which is disposed between the holding portion 53 and the piston section 54 and which applies a pressing force to the piston section 54 against the oil pressure; a magnetic piece 55 attached to the end portion of the piston section 54 and<br><br><br>
having a rectangular plate shape and the like. One end portion of the piston section 54 is disposed on the side of the pressure detection hole 51c, and formed into a slidable shaft shape with respect to the bearing portion 56. A middle portion of the piston section is formed into a slightly enlarged diameter, and the other end portion thereof is formed into a slightly thick shaft shape. The holding portion 53 is formed in such a manner that the enlarged-diameter middle portion of the piston section 54 is movable to thereby slide the piston section in the holding portion. Moreover, the other end portion of the holding portion having the shaft shape is formed in such a manner as to protrude. The holding portion 53 is fixed, via bolts or the like, to the end face of the case main body section 51 in which the pressure detection hole 51c is formed. The spring 58 is disposed between the middle portion of the piston section 54 having the enlarged-diameter plate shape, and the holding portion 53, and applies an urging force to the piston section 54 toward the pressure detection hole 51c.<br>
The cover section 52 is entirely formed into substantially the same rectangular block shape as that of the case main body section 51 using a material similar to that of the case main body section. A hollow portion 52a which covers the periphery of the switch operation mechanism 65 is formed in one end face of the cover section 52. The cover section abuts on the end face of the case main body section 51 via a sealing material or the like, and is fixed via bolts or the like on the side of the hollow portion 52a. The hollow portion 52a is formed into such a size that the hollow portion does not abut on the magnetic piece 55, when the piston section 54 slides.<br>
The switch section 59 operates, when the magnetic piece 55 approaches the switch section. The switch section is attached to the outer end face of the cover section 52 facing the magnetic piece 55. An operation signal of the switch section 59 is transmitted to the control device 60 which controls an operation for error detection.<br>
Next, an operation of the mixed liquid supplying apparatus 10 constituted as described above will be described concretely.  First,  the mixing ratio variable<br><br><br>
mechanism 41 (41) is manually operated to thereby set a mixing ratio in accordance with a type of a vehicle to which a mixed liquid is to be supplied. Next, a liquid supply operation is started, for example, in a state in which the switching valve 39 is switched to the side of the tank 31 in accordance with the set mixing ratio. Then, in the first supplying mechanism 20, the liquid supply pump 23 is driven by the motor 22, the gasoline of the underground tank flows through the liquid supply pipe 21, a flow rate is controlled by the flow rate control valve 24 (24), and the gasoline is dispensed by the first flowmeter 25 (25), and discharged from the liquid-supply nozzle 16 (16) through the liquid-supply hose 15 (15). Moreover, in the second supplying mechanism 30, the oil pump 40 is driven, and the oil of the tank 31 flows through the pipe 35, and is branched into two systems by the oil pressure detection device 50. The oil is dispensed by the second flowmeter 42 (42) in accordance with the mixing ratio set by the mixing ratio variable mechanism 41 (41), and flows through the hose 43 (43). The oil is supplied to the liquid-supply hose 15 (15) in the vicinity of the liquid-supply nozzle 16 (16) through the check valve 17 (17), and discharged as a mixed liquid from the liquid-supply nozzle 16 (16). In the oil pressure detection device 50, when the oil flows to the outflow ports 51b, 51b from the inflow port 51a through the inlet-side passage and outlet-side passage, the piston section 54 slides against the urging force of the spring 58 by the oil pressure, and the magnetic piece 55 attached to the end portion of the piston section 54 approaches the switch section 59. When the oil pressure reaches a predetermined pressure, and the magnetic piece 55 of the piston section 54 sufficiently approaches the switch section<br>
59,	the switch section 59 turns on, and the signal is transmitted to the control device<br>
60.	When the oil pressure drops, the piston section 54 slides the pressure detection<br>
hole 51c by the urging force of the spring 58, and the magnetic piece 55 is detached<br>
from the switch section 59 to thereby turn off the switch section.<br>
Next, an error detecting operation by the control device 60 of the oil pressure detection device 50 will be described concretely. As shown in a flowchart of FIG. 6, first the liquid-supply nozzle 16 is removed from the nozzle holder 18 in order to supply mixed oil.   When the liquid supply pump 23 is turned on by the motor 22<br><br><br>
(ST1), it is judged whether or not the mixing ratio set by the mixing ratio variable mechanism 41 (41) is in a range of 2 to 5% (ST2). When the ratio is in the range, it is judged whether or not a time of 1500 msec has elapsed after the liquid supply pump 23 turns on (ST3). A time elapsed until a stable operation is obtained at the start of liquid supply is set to 1500 msec, and after the elapse of time an error operation is detected by detection of the oil pressure. Next, it is judged whether or not the oil is being supplied (ST4). During the oil supply, it is judged whether or not an off-time of the switch section 59 by the fluctuation of the oil pressure has continued by 500 msec in the oil pressure detection device 50 (ST5). When the off-time of 500 msec continues during the oil supply, it is judged that the oil is not normally supplied because of breakdown of the oil pump 40, cutting of the belt for driving the oil pump 40, suction of air or another cause. A reason why continuation of the off-time is set to 500 msec is that the switch section easily temporarily turns off in a normal oil supply state in a case where an oil mixing ratio is high or the oil is simultaneously supplied from two systems, but this temporary off-time is prevented from being judged as abnormal. Next, when the off-time continues by 500 msec, it is judged whether or not the oil is usually supplied (ST6). When the oil is usually supplied, it is judged that the oil is not normally supplied for some cause. The control device 60 instructs processes such as stopping of the oils supply as a predetermined error setting (ST7). When it can be judged that the oil supply normally ends (ST8), the oil supply is ended, and the process returns to a first step to judge whether or not to start the oil supply again.<br>
As described above, in the mixed liquid supplying apparatus 10 constituted as described above, the oil pressure detection device 50 is disposed in the passage through which the oil is supplied, the on/off operation of the switch section 59 by the pressure of the circulating oil is detected, abnormality is judged, and error processes such as oil supply stop are performed. Therefore, the abnormality of the oil pump 40 can be detected, quality level of fuel oil can be secured, and damages are prevented from being brought to any customer.<br><br><br>
It is to be noted that in the above-described embodiment, the mixed liquid supplying apparatus including two systems has been described as an example, but the apparatus may include one system or two or more systems. When a plurality of systems are included, the oil pressure detection devices 50 may be disposed separately in the respective branched passages. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the example in which the gasoline is mixed with the oil has been described, but the present invention is also applicable to a case where a main first liquid is mixed with a second liquid, for example, a case where light oil is mixed with additives.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, there is provided a mixed liquid supplying apparatus comprising a pressure detection device disposed in a passage to which one liquid is supplied. Accordingly, an on/off operation of a switch section by a pressure of the circulating liquid is detected, abnormality is judged, and error processes such as oil supply stop are performed. Therefore, the abnormality of a pump for supplying an oil liquid can be detected, quality level of fuel oil can be secured, and damages are prevented from being brought to any customer.<br><br><br>
