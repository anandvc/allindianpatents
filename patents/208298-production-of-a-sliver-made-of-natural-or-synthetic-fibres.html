Production of a sliver made of natural or synthetic fibres<br>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for performing the method pursuant to the preamble of claim 1 and the preamble of claim 8 as well as the independent method claim 17.<br>
Different devices are known from practice such as from US-PS 3,987,615, with a mixture of slivers of natural and synthetic fibres on a draw-frame disposed downstream of the combing machine occurring for the production of a mixed yarn made from natural and synthetic fibres. In order to obtain a thorough mixture of the fibres it is necessary to have two or three process stages for the drafting.<br>
Moreover, from US-PS 5,155,989 a method is known, with a mixture of the different fibre materials occurring already prior to the processing of a combing machine. The combing machines are used for the production of a high-quality fibre mixture from which short fibres are separated. In the example of the US specification the entire fibre mixture, i.e. also the synthetic fibres, are guided over the combing tools. As the synthetic fibres maintain their fibre length in the machinery, i.e. they have a constant staple, the combing of these fibres is actually not necessary. This means that in the processing of an already mixed fibre mixture made of natural and synthetic fibres on the combing machine an unnecessary amount of energy is spent in order to also guide the synthetic fibres through the combing process.<br>
Special devices such as a melange gillbox are known from practice where the mixture of different materials is performed.  As is already described above,  up to<br><br>
three drawing passages are required to obtain a homogenous mixture between synthetic and natural fibres.<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of providing a method and an apparatus to produce a sliver of synthetic and natural fibres or of different fibre mixtures of natural fibres for further processing in the following spinning process in a simple manner with already existing devices and, optionally, by eliminating further drawing passages.<br>
This object is achieved, on the one hand, in such a way that the slivers supplied by the combing heads of a combing machine are mixed with a mixture of fibres which has not taken part in the combing process prior to their entrance into the main drafting zone of the drafting arrangement device of the combing machine.<br>
The admixed mixture of fibres could consist, for example, of separately combed and subsequently dyed natural fibres or preferably of slivers made of synthetic fibres.<br>
It is further proposed that the slivers made from synthetic fibres be drawn off from containers provided for the combing machines and are mixed in a positioned manner with the slivers made from natural fibres by way of a feed device.<br>
A favourable mixing ratio is achieved when the slivers made of natural fibres are added at least with the number of slivers made of synthetic fibres which corresponds to the number of slivers of natural fibres. Preferably, the distribution of the slivers made of natural fibres occurs evenly over the width of the sliver bunch.<br><br>
In order to achieve an even sliver and to eliminate the need of an autoleveller in a finisher gill, it is proposed that the drafting in the drafting arrangement be performed on the combing machine in a regulated manner in order to even out fluctuations in the mass of the supplied fibre mass made of synthetic and natural fibres. This offset is performed on the basis of a predetermined setpoint value.<br>
In order to achieve a homogeneous mixture, the fibre mixture to be admixed is supplied in the form of a fibre fleece between the preliminary and main drafting zone of the drafting arrangement.<br>
The object is also achieved by the apparatus claim pursuant to claim 8, with the proposal being made that slivers which have not taken part in the combing process are drawn off by way of draw-off devices from containers provided to the combing machines and are supplied to a feed device arranged above the guide table for delivery to the sliver bunch of the slivers made of natural fibres.<br>
It is proposed that the separately supplied slivers consist of synthetic fibres.<br>
Preferably, the feed device is arranged in such a way that the supplied slivers of synthetic fibres are distributed evenly over the width of the sliver bunch made of natural fibres. The feed device can be provided with a respective sensor device in order to monitor or control the delivery of the slivers.<br>
It is further proposed that the drafting arrangement device be provided with an autoleveller device. On the one hand,  this helps to achieve the evening of the<br><br>
supplied sliver mass and, on the other hand, need of an additional autoleveller can be eliminated in one of the subsequent drafting arrangement processes.<br>
In order to be able to detect and even out short-wave fluctuations in mass (e.g. piecing positions) it is proposed that at least two drafting arrangement units be provided one after the other, with at least one of the drafting arrangement units being provided with an autoleveller device. Usually, a sliver is already formed after the first drafting arrangement unit which is scanned with an additional measuring member in order to detect the short-wave fluctuations in thickness. Any short-wave fluctuations are then evened out in the subsequent drafting arrangement unit by an autoleveller device•<br>
As a result of the admixture of additional slivers made of synthetic fibres the drafting arrangement unit on the combing machine is provided with a relatively large mass for processing. In order to be able to cope better with this mass it is proposed that the drafting arrangement device be formed by at least two drafting arrangement units operating in parallel where the supplied fibre mass is processed proportionately.<br>
In this respect it is proposed that the drafting arrangement units each be equipped with an autoleveller device.<br>
If the two drafting arrangement units are provided with two successive drafting arrangements, then it is preferable if at least one drafting arrangement is provided with an autoleveller device.<br><br>
When using two drafting arrangement units operating in parallel the combing machine slivers can be deposited in a joint container or in two separate containers.<br>
It is also possible to supply the slivers which are delivered by the drafting arrangement units operating in parallel to a subsequent drafting arrangement which would then form a single sliver from the two supplied slivers.<br>
The object to achieve the invention is also achieved by the features of the independent method claim 14.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are described and explained by reference to the following examples, in which:<br>

Fig. 5 shows a top view pursuant to fig. 1 with a special arrangement of the drafting arrangement device;<br>
Fig. 6 shows a top view pursuant to fig. 1 with a special arrangement of the drafting arrangement unit;<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows a schematic partial view of a combing machine with a special arrangement of the drafting arrangement device and a supply means for the synthetic slivers.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the process stages.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic top view of a combing machine 1 which is provided with eight combing heads K in the shown example. As is schematically shown further, a wound lap W is placed on each combing head. The wound laps W consist in the represented example of wound webs made of cotton fibres (natural fibres) . In order to process the web the wound lap is wound off for each combing head and is combed out by way of combing devices (not shown in closer detail). The short fibres (noils) are separated, as are the shares in impurities and the neps, and the fibres are parallelised. Following the combing process, which shall not be explained here in closer detail, a fibre fleece V is formed at each combing head K. This fibre fleece V is indicated with the broken lines. The fibre fleeces V are joined into slivers F and delivered to a feed table 2, on which they are deflected by means of deflection rollers R by 90° and are further conveyed in the direction towards a drafting arrangement device 4.<br>
The individual fibres F are disposed adjacent to one another on the feed table 2 and are supplied in a sliver bunch to the drafting arrangement device 4. Before the slivers F are introduced into the drafting arrangement device 4 they are guided past a feed device 6. The feed device 6 extends transversally over the sliver bunch. The special arrangement of the feed device 6 shall not be described in closer detail, as<br><br>
similar devices are already known. Such a device is disclosed in EP-A-67 9 741 for example. In this example the slivers which are drawn off from provided cans are supplied to a subsequent drafting arrangement unit. In the present example of the invention the slivers S which are drawn off from the cans B and consist of synthetic fibres are drawn off by way of draw-off devices A (shown schematically) and supplied to the feed device 6. The slivers S are guided further downwardly in the direction of the sliver bunch of the slivers F (cotton) and impinge upon this sliver bunch. As a result of the movement of the sliver bunch of the slivers F in the conveying direction T the slivers S are entrained. In this way, a new sliver bunch 8 is formed which now consists of slivers F of cotton and of slivers S of synthetic material. This sliver bunch 8 then reaches the drafting arrangement device 4 where it is drafted. The fleece 9 exiting from the drafting arrangement device is joined into a sliver 10 (also called combing machine sliver) and deposited in a can Bl by a depositing device (shown schematically) in the form of a pair of calender rollers 39.<br>
Fig, 2 shows a schematic side view of the combing machine 1 with a regulated drafting arrangement device 4 and the feed device 6. A draw-off device A is shown in a schematically shown frame 14, which draw-off device is formed by two draw-off rollers 15, 16 which are held on the frame 14. At least one of the two draw-off rollers 15, 16 is driven or provided with a direct drive, with the second draw-off roller resting spring-loaded on the first driven draw-off roller.<br>
The sliver S (synthetic fibres) which is drawn off from can B by way of a draw-off device A is guided to a deflection roller 18 of the feed device 6. Furthermore, the sliver S and further slivers are transferred to a<br><br>
pair of rollers 20 which introduces the supplied slivers S into the sliver bunch of the slivers F. One of the two rollers of the pair of rollers 2 0 is provided with a drive (not shown) . For the purpose of synchronisation, the drives of the draw-off device A, the feed device 6 and the pair of rollers 2 0 are connected with the drive of the combing machine by way of a control or drive. In order to monitor and control the joining of the slivers made of natural fibres with the slivers made of synthetic fibres sensors (not shown) can be provided in the zone of the transfer position 17 by means of which the transfer times can be controlled or monitored.<br>
In the shown example the sliver bunch 8 of natural and synthetic fibres reaches a pair of feed rollers 22 which are used to supply the fibre mass to the actual drafting arrangement device 4. The pair of feed rollers 22 is connected with the drive of the drafting arrangement drive 4, as is schematically shown. The sliver bunch is now guided through a measuring member 2 4 where the fibre mass is detected. The measured values as delivered by the measuring member 24 are supplied to a control unit 26 via a line 25. On the basis of a predetermined setpoint value SW a motor M2 is controlled via the control unit 2 6 in order to drive the pair of output rollers 32 of the drafting arrangement device 4. The pair of input rollers 30 and the pair of rollers 31 are driven by a motor Ml which is also controlled by the control unit 26. A transmission gear 33 (shown schematically) is arranged between the drive of the pair of rollers 30 and the pair of rollers 31, which gear is used to set the preliminary draft of the sliver mass between the pair of rollers 30 and 31. The pair of feed rollers 22 and the pair of rollers 30 are provided with the same circumferential  speed.  The main  draft  is  performed<br><br>
between the pair of rollers 31 and 32. The size of the draft is the result of the difference of the rotational speeds of the motor Ml to motor M2 . A further measuring member 34 is arranged at the output of the drafting arrangement device 4 downstream of the pair of rollers 32. It is used for verifying the control interventions. Moreover, short-wave fluctuations in mass can also be verified with the measuring member 34. The signals generated in the measuring member 34 are supplied to the control unit 2 6 by way of a line 35 and exert, as is generally known, an influence on the control intervention by the control unit 2 6.<br>
The fibre fleece 9 exiting from the drafting arrangement device 4 is joined into sliver 10 (also called combing machine sliver) by a schematically shown guide device 37 and supplied to a pair of calender rollers 39. The pair of calender rollers 39 transfers the sliver to a funnel wheel 38 which is used to deposit the sliver in a can or a container Bl. The sliver deposited in the can Bl is supplied to further processing in a subsequent drawing passage once the can Bl has been filled. Further details will be described in fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further setup variant of the cans B for the slivers made of synthetic fibres. The slivers S are drawn off from the cans B with the already described draw-off devices A and transferred to the zone of the feed device 6 by means of guide devices (not shown in closer detail). The transfer of the slivers S occurs above the slivers F guided on the feed table 2 and can occur by means of one or several conveyor belts. Similarly, the transfer would also be possible by means of a frame on which several guide rollers are attached for the guidance of the slivers S. The supply of the slivers S in the zone of the feed device 6 can be<br><br>
performed according to the embodiment as shown in fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of the drafting arrangement device 4, with the same being formed from a drafting arrangement unit 40 and a subsequent drafting arrangement unit 41. The drafting arrangement unit 40 is set with a fixed draft, whereas the drafting arrangement unit 41 is provided with an autoleveller device 44 for levelling out fluctuations in mass. The special design of the autoleveller device shall not be further discussed herein, as such autoleveller devices belong to the general state of the art. The sliver bunch 8 made of slivers S (synthetic fibres) and slivers F (natural fibres) is drawn into the drafting arrangement unit 4 0 to a specific value, and then joined into a fibre fleece 4 2 and then into a sliver 43. The mass of the sliver is scanned by means of a measuring member 45. As a result of the signals of said member the autoleveller device 4 4 intervenes in a regulating manner in the drafting arrangement unit 41. The sliver supplied by the drafting arrangement unit 41 is supplied by way of a pair of calender rollers 3 9 to a can Bl for depositing, as was already explained.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further possibility for the arrangement of the drafting arrangement device 4, with the sliver bunch 8 being divided into two similarly large feeds 8a and 8b by means of a dividing element 47. If one assumes that slivers which are formed in the individual combing heads have a mass of 8 g/m, then this results in a total mass of 64 g/m for 8 combing heads and the sliver F. If this sliver mass is mixed with slivers with 8 g/m made of synthetic fibres, then this leads to a total mass of the sliver bunch 8 of 128 g/m when also supplying 8 slivers S.<br><br>
In order to achieve a combing machine sliver of 5 g/m for further processing in the following process it would be necessary to operate with a draft of not less than 25 in the drafting arrangement unit 4. The amount of this draft can no longer be performed in a controlled manner with a conventional drafting arrangement device with respect to the amount of the fibre mass to be processed. In the shown example pursuant to fig. 5 it is therefore proposed that the sliver mass 8 be divided into two streams of masses 8a and 8b. The division occurs by way of the indicated dividing element 4 7. The following drafting arrangement units 4 8, 4 9 are now supplied with a mass of 64 g/m to be processed, which for the achievement of a sliver of 5 g/m to be formed requires a draft of approx. 13. This amount of draft can be easily performed with the conventional drafting arrangements. The slivers subsequently formed in the drafting arrangement units 48, 4 9 are deposited in cans B2 and B3.<br>
A further embodiment of the drafting arrangement unit 4 is shown in fig. 6. According to the arrangement pursuant to f ig. 5, the sliver bunch 8 is here too divided into two partial streams 8a and 8b by way of the dividing element 47 and supplied to two drafting arrangement units 48 and 49 which operate in parallel. The fibre fleece 51 produced in the drafting arrangement unit 48 is joined into a sliver 54 and the fibre fleece 52 of the drafting arrangement 49 is joined into a sliver 55. These two slivers 54, 55 are joined in the pair of rollers 57 and transferred to a subsequent drafting arrangement unit 5 9. The drafting arrangement unit 59, which can also be provided with an autoleveller device for example, forms a sliver 10 which is deposited in a can Bl.<br><br>
Instead of the formation of a sliver 54, 55 each it is also possible to guide the fibre fleeces 51, 52, which are delivered by the drafting arrangements 4 8 and 4 9, above one another or to twist the same and to feed it as twisted fibre fleece to the drafting arrangement 5 9 downstream for drafting. Such a twisting of fleece is already known, for example, from EP-Al 478 992 and will be explained below in closer detail in fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment, where the mixture of natural fibres and synthetic fibres is performed by the joining of already drawn fibre fleeces of both fibre materials, which means that the first mixture does not occur in the form of the joining of individual fibres, but of fibre fleeces. The slivers F delivered by the combing heads K are supplied to the drafting arrangement device 4 by way of a pair of feed rollers 22. This drafting arrangement device 4 is arranged as a drafting arrangement 4 over 4, i.e. the preliminary draft of the drafting arrangement device 4 is performed between the pairs of rollers 60 and 61. The main draft is performed between the pairs of rollers 63 and 64. Following the pair of rollers 64 the exiting fibre fleece 9 is joined into a sliver 10 by way of a guide device 37 and deposited in a can Bl by way of a pair of calender rollers 39 or a funnel wheel 38. The pair of output rollers 64 is driven by a motor M2 which is controlled by a control unit 63. This control unit 63 receives signals from the measuring member 64 which is located between the pair of rollers 61 and 63 of the preliminary draft VV or the main draft HV. On the basis of these signals the drive of the pair of rollers 64 can be varied in order to achieve a desired setpoint value on the output of the drafting arrangement as a result of the change in the draft which is achieved in this way. The motor Ml is controlled via the control unit 63. The motor Ml is responsible for the drive of<br><br>
the pairs of rollers 22, 60, 61 and 63 by using transmission gears (not shown in closer detail). The slivers S (synthetic fibres) which are drawn off from the can B are transferred by means of the draw-off device A to a guide means 66 from where they are delivered in a parallel adjacent alignment to a drafting arrangement unit 68. In the drafting arrangement unit 68 a fibre fleece 7 0 is formed which is guided into the nip gap of the pair of rollers 68 by way of a guide plate 71. In the nip gap of the pair of rollers 63 the fibre fleece 7 0 made of synthetic fibres is joined or twisted with fibre fleece 72 made of natural fibres. The actual mixing of the synthetic fibres with the natural fibres occurs in the following main drafting field HV.<br>
If reference is made to natural fibres, then cotton fibres or other natural fibre materials are primarily meant. The synthetic fibres may concern polyester for example.<br>
Fig. 8 schematically shows a process for achieving a mixed yarn on the basis of the mixture in accordance with the invention of natural fibres with synthetic fibres on the combing machine. The cotton material prepared by a blowroom (not shown) is processed in a card KA and is joined into a sliver. The shown overview is to be regarded merely schematically, as no information is provided on the number of machines of the individual process stages. The sliver supplied by several cards KA is further processed in a draw frame ST. For the formation of a lap the sliver formed in the draw frame is supplied to a lap-forming machine KV. Eight such wound laps W from the lap-forming machine KV are supplied to a subsequent combing machine 1 for combing. Usually, several lap-forming machines and combing machines  are  involved in the process.  The<br><br>
number of machines is based on the production or production capacity of each machine. The slivers which are made of synthetic fibres and are produced in the preparatory stage SV are deposited in cans B and transferred with these to the combing machine 1. The setup of the cans B is identical with the already described embodiment of fig. 3.<br>
The sliver which is formed in the combing machine(s) as described above is supplied in the form of cans to a subsequent draw frame STI for further processing. The draw frame STI twists and evens the supplied slivers and deposits them in a can B4 after the drafting process. These cans B4 are supplied to a further subsequent draw frame STII for further processing - The sliver formed in the draw frame STI I is deposited in the can B5 which is transferred for example to a subsequent flyer FL for the production of speed frame bobbins. These speed frame bobbins, which are not shown here in closer detail, are then supplied to a ring spinning machine RS via known conveyor systems in which a yarn is formed. At least one of the two draw frame stages STI or STII can be provided with an autoleveller device for evening of the sliver.<br>
As a result of the proposed mixture of the synthetic yarns with natural yarns in the combing machine it is possible to eliminate at least one of the drawing passages which are provided downstream of the combing machines.<br><br><br><br><br>
