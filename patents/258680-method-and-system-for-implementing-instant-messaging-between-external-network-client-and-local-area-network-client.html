METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPLEMENTING INSTANT MESSAGING BETWEEN EXTERNAL NETWORK CLIENT AND<br>
LOCAL AREA NETWORK CLIENT<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a computer network technology, and particularly, to a method and system for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a Local Area Network (LAN) client.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Network instant messaging software has been accepted by most net users and has become a users' necessary tool, not only widely used in daily entertainment but also in users' work. For diversified requirements of users, various instant messaging providers have proposed group-based services. A user may not only experience the one-to-one communication, but also communicate to a group of persons which have the same character or category in a virtual space. Likewise, along with the development of group, some instant messaging providers propose LAN instant messaging software used by LAN users. The LAN instant messaging software is favorable to establish a flat communication platform within a minor enterprise, and a user may use the platform to communicate on work, so that the informatization of minor enterprises can be greatly improved.<br>
The LAN instant messaging software in the prior art performs the instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client. Fig. 1 is an architecture diagram illustrating a system for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client in the prior art. As shown in Fig.l, the system includes:<br>
a web page server adapted to convert the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to a private protocol used by LAN instant messaging and vice versa;<br>
a database server adapted to store the registration information when a LAN client registers a remote login service;<br>
a transfer server adapted to transfer data between a LAN gateway and the web page server;<br>
a LAN server, deployed inside the LAN, and adapted to provide a client with applications of basic services associated with instant messaging such as login, state and message forwarding as well as other extended services;<br><br>
a LAN gateway, deployed at the internal edge of a LAN, and adapted to provide data channels for the communication between the inside and outside of the LAN.<br>
The procedure of an external network client establishing and performing instant messaging with a LAN client over the above system is as follows.<br>
An external network client sends, through a WEB mode, to the web page server a login request carrying the identifier and password of the external network client, the identifier of the LAN to be logged in and a remote login password.<br>
The web page server converts the login request from the HTTP format into a private protocol format used by the LAN instant messaging, and sends the login request to the LAN gateway.<br>
The LAN gateway authenticates the user's login information. If the authentication is passed, the LAN gateway returns an authentication passing response to the external network client via the web page server.<br>
The external network client performs the instant messaging with a LAN client via. the web page server and the transfer server through the WEB mode after adding a LAN client to be communicated with as a contact man. The protocol conversion of the instant messages between the external network client and the LAN client is performed by the web page server.<br>
The disadvantages of the above procedure of an external network client establishing and performing instant messaging with a LAN client are as follows.<br>
An external network client has to log in a LAN tlirough the WEB mode to perform instant messaging with a LAN client. Since it requires protocol conversion, the clients only can send ordinary instant messages, perform the file transmission and send short messages, so the clients can not download an organization structure and also can not extend the functions of video and audio.<br>
In addition, only one long connection exists between the LAN gateway and the transfer server as well as between the web page server and the transfer server, which leads to bad expandability and it is difficult to support a large amount of clients.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client, so as to solve the problem that the external network client has to establish and perfonn the instant messaging with the LAN client through the WEB mode in the prior art.<br><br>
The technical solution of the present invention is as follows.<br>
A method for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client, including:<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Since an external network client has to establish and perform instant messaging with a LAN client through the WEB mode which requires protocol conversion, the clients can not download the organization structure and extend the functions of video and audio while logging in a LAN. The major idea of the present invention is to provide a solution for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client. In this scheme, a public network server allocates a session server and resources for the instant communication, and sends the address of the session server and the resource identifier to the LAN gateway and the external network client. The LAN gateway and the external network client establish a connection with the session server according to the address of the session server and the resource identifier respectively. So that the external network client can perform the instant messaging with the designated LAN client by logging in the LAN through the connection between the external network client and the session server and the connection between the session server and the LAN gateway without protocol conversion.<br><br>
A detailed description of the implementation in accordance with the present invention is provided hereinafter with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flowchart of a LAN gateway logging in a public network server in accordance with the present invention. As shown in Fig.2, the LAN gateway is deployed within a LAN and adapted to provide the LAN with a data channel communicating with external networks. The public network server is operated and managed by an instant messaging service provider. When logging in the public network server, the LAN gateway sends the LAN identifier and login password to the public network server and the public network server authenticates the identification of the LAN. The specific process is as follows.<br>
Step S20: when logging in the public network server, the LAN gateway sends a login request carrying the LAN identifier and login password to the public network server.<br>
The LAN identifier is applied by the LAN during registering a remote login service, and the login password is set by the LAN during registering. After the registration is completed, the LAN identifier and login password are saved in the LAN information database at the side of the public network server.<br>
The LAN may reset the login password as required. After the login password is reset, the LAN sends the modified login password to the LAN information database to update the stored original login password.<br>
Step S21: after receiving the login request from the LAN gateway, the public network server authenticates the identification of LAN. The authentication includes: the public network server acquires the login password registered by the LAN from the LAN information database according to the LAN identifier carried by the login request, and determines whether the login password registered by the LAN matches the login password reported by the LAN gateway. If yes, the authentication is passed and proceeds to Step S22; otherwise, the authentication fails and proceeds to Step S23.<br>
Step S22: the public network server creates a key used for communicating with the LAN gateway, returns a login request acceptance message carrying the key to the LAN gateway. The LAN gateway establishes a long connection with the public network server. The data between the LAN gateway and the public network server is encrypted and decrypted by using the key.<br>
Step S23: the public network server returns a login request rejection message to the LAN gateway, and the procedure is over.<br><br>
Fig. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.3, the implementation procedure is mainly as follows.<br>
Step S30: the external network client sends to a public network server a user authentication request carrying the identifier and password of the external network client as well as the identifier of the LAN to be logged in.<br>
Step S31: the public network server searches a network connection corresponding to the LAN gateway according to the identifier of the LAN to be logged in, and forwards the LAN login request from the external network client to the LAN gateway according to the searched network connection.<br>
Step S32: the LAN gateway authenticates the identification and rights of the external network client according to the identifier and password of the external network client carried by the user authentication request. If the authentication is passed, the LAN gateway returns an authentication success message to the public network server, and proceeds to Step S33; otherwise, the LAN gateway returns an authentication failure message to the public network server, and the procedure is over.<br>
Step S33: the public network server allocates a session server and channel resources for the instant messaging according to the load condition of each session server connected with the public network server, and generates a digital signature based on the signature algorithm predetermined with the session server according to current time and the channel resource identifier.<br>
The public network server periodically acquires the load condition parameter of each session server connected thereto as well as the number of LANs and external network clients supported by each session server. The load condition parameter indicates the CPU utilization, the network bandwidth utilization and the memory usage status of the session server.<br>
In general, there are multiple session servers connected to the public network server, but it is possible that there is only one session server connected to the public network server in accordance with the present invention. When the public network server only connects to one session server, in the step 833, the public network server only allocates the channel resources for the instant messaging, and generates a digital signature based on the signature algorithm predetennined with the session server according to current time and the channel resource identifier.<br>
Step S34: the public network server sends the address of the session server, the channel resource identifier and the generated digital signature to the LAN gateway.<br><br>
Step S3 5: the LAN gateway connects to the corresponding session server according to the received address of the session server, and sends to the session server a LAN gateway login request carrying the generated digital signature and the channel resource identifier.<br>
Steps S36a'^S36b: the session server receives the LAN gateway login request sent by the LAN gateway, parses the digital signature carried by the LAN gateway login request according to the signature algorithm predetermined with the public network server, detennines whether the signature is expired, and determines whether the channel resource identifier parsed from the digital signature is same as the channel resource identifier carried by the LAN gateway login request; if the channel resource identifiers are same and the signature is not expired, keeps connecting with the LAN gateway, and returns a LAN gateway login success message to the public network server via the LAN gateway.<br>
Steps S37a-'S37b: after receiving the LAN gateway login success message, the public network server informs the external network client of the address of the session server, the channel resource identifier and the generated digital signature. The external network client connects to the corresponding session server according to the received address of the session server, and sends to the session server a user login request carrying the generated digital signature and the channel resource identifier.<br>
Steps S38a-'S38b: the session server receives the user login request sent by the external network client, parses the digital signature carried by the user login request according to the signature algorithm predetermined with the public network server, determines whether the signature is expired, and determines whether the channel resource identifier parsed the digital signature is same as the channel resource identifier carried by the user login request; if the channel resource identifiers are same and the signature is not expired, keeps connecting with the external network client, and returns a user login success message to the external network client.<br>
Steps S39a-'S39b: the external network client sends to the LAN gateway a LAN connect request carrying the IP address and port number of a LAN server via the session server. The LAN gateway connects to the LAN server. The LAN server returns a connection establishment success message to the external network client via the LAN gateway and the session server.<br>
Steps S40a^S40b: the external network client logs in the LAN server; the LAN server sends the organization structure of the LAN client to the external network client.<br>
Steps S41a--S41b: the external network client selects a target contact man from the organization structure, and performs the instant messaging with the target contact man via the session server.<br><br>
When sending data, the external network client sends the data to the LAN server through the connection between the external network client and the session server, the connection between the session server and the LAN gateway and the connection between the LAN gateway and the LAN server; the LAN server forwards the data to the target contact man.<br>
When receiving data, the LAN server forwards the data which receiver is the external network client to the external network client through the connection between the LAN gateway and the session server and the connection between the session server and the external network client.<br>
The external network client performs the instant messaging with the LAN client using the existing protocol, which will not be further described herein.<br>
Gon-esponding to the above method, the present invention further provides a system for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client. Fig. 4 is a structure diagram illustrating a system for implementing instant messaging between an external network client and a LAN client. As shown in Fig.4, the system includes: an external network client 10, a public network server 20, a LAN gateway 30, a session server 40, a registration server 50 and a database server 60.<br>
The external network client 10 sends to a public network server 20 a user authentication request carrying the identifier and password of the external network client 10 as well as the identifier of the LAN to be logged in. The public network server 20 forwards the user authentication request to the LAN gateway 30 according to the identifier of the LAN to be logged in. The LAN gateway 30 authenticates the identification and rights of the external network client 10, returns an authentication success message to the public network server 20 when the authentication is passed, returns an authentication failure message to the public network server 20 when the authentication fails.<br>
The public network server 20 allocates a session server 40 and channel resources for the instant messaging when receiving the authentication success message, and generates a digital signature based on the signature algorithm predetenmined with the session server 40 according to current time and the channel resource identifier, and sends the address of the session server 40, the channel resource identifier and the generated digital signature to the LAN gateway 30 and the external network client 10.<br>
The LAN gateway 30 sends to the session server 40 a LAN gateway login request carrying the generated digital signature and the channel resource identifier according to the received address of the session server 40 and the identifier of the channel resources.<br><br>
The session server 40 receives the LAN gateway login request sent by the LAN gateway 30, parses the digital signature carried by the LAN gateway login request according to the signature algorithm predetermined with the public network server 20, determines whether the signature is expired, and determines whether the channel resource identifier parsed from the digital signature is same as the channel resource identifier carried by the LAN gateway login request; keeps connecting with the LAN gateway 30 when the channel resource identifiers are same and the signature is not expired.<br>
The external network client 10 sends to the session server 40 a user login request carrying the digital signature and the channel resource identifier according to the received address of the session server 40 and the channel resource identifier.<br>
The session server 40 receives the user login request sent by the external network client 10, parses the digital signature carried by the user login request according to the signature algorithm predetermined with the public network server 20, determines whether the signature is expired, and determines whether the channel resource identifier parsed from the digital signature is same as the channel resource identifier carried by the user login request; keeps connecting with the external network client 10 when the channel resource identifiers are same and the signature is not expired.<br>
The extemal network client 10 sends to the LAN gateway 30 a LAN connect request carrying the IP address and port number of a LAN server via the session server 40; the LAN gateway 30 connects to the LAN server; the LAN server retums a connection establishment success message to the extemal network client 10 via the LAN gateway 30 and the session sei'ver 40.<br>
The extemal network client 10 logs in the LAN server via the session server 40 and the LAN gateway 30, and performing instant messaging with the LAN client.<br>
In addition the registration server 50 provides the LAN with a remote login registering service, and allocates the LAN identifier for the LAN while the LAN gateway 30 registers a remote login service.<br>
The database server 60 records the acquired LAN identifier and the password set correspondingly while the LAN gateway 30 registers a remote login service.<br>
Here, the public network server 20 also can send the address of the session server 40, the channel resource identifier and the generated digital signature to the LAN gateway 30 first, and after receiving the LAN gateway login success message from the session server 40, then sends the<br><br>
address of the session server 40, the channel resource identifier and the generated digital signature to the external network client 10.<br>
