DIRECTLY COMPRESSIBLE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR THE ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF CCI-779<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rapamycin 42-ester with 3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropionic acid (CCI-779) is an anticancer agent and is characterized by the following structure.<br><br>
CCI-779 exhibits cytostatic, as opposed to cytotoxic properties, and may delay the progression of tumors or tumor recurrence. The mechanism of action of" CCI-779 that results in the Gl to S phase block is novel for an anticancer drug. In vitro, CCI-779 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a number of histologically diverse tumor cells. Central nervous system (CNS) cancer, leukemia (T-cell), breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma lines were among the most sensitive to CCI-779. The compound arrested cells in the Gl phase of the cell cycle.<br>
CCI-779 has poor water solubility (less than 1 jig/ml) and high permeability (Log PC ³ 4.1 in 1 -octanoI/water system and Peff = 4-5 X 10-5 cm/sec obtained from in situ rat intestinal permsion study using metoprolol tartrate as a marker) and is classified as class II compound according to BCS classification system. One obstacle towards the formulation of CCI-779 is its poor aqueous dissolution and low oral bio availability.<br>
-1 -<br><br>
WO 2005/070393	PCT/US2004/042178<br>
Additionally, CC1-779 exhibits aqueous instability and has shown its potential to undergo oxidation.<br>
A CCI-779 formulation was developed that employed a wet granulation manufacturing process. US Published Patent Application, Publication No. US- 2004-0077677-A1. This process involved preparation of a hydroalcoholic granulation solution of CCI-779. Further, although the resulting tablets were stable and bioavailable, the preparation of the hydroalcoholic solution was very tedious. Further, CCI-779 was thermodynamically unstable, precipitating within one day after its preparation, requiring it to be used immediately after its preparation.<br>
In view of this, a simple manufacturing process is required that can produce stable and bioavailable tablets and can be used for commercial manufacturing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a convenient and effective method to deliver therapeutic levels of CCI-779 to the patient. The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing a stable and bioavailable form of micronized CCI-779, and optionally, an antioxidant or a chelating agent, or mixtures thereof, in an immediate release dosage form for oral administration. The composition is in the form of a tablet or in filled capsules.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides micronized CCI-779, that can be readable formulated into an oral dosage unit, and is particularly well suited for a directly compressible unit. The inventors have found that tablets prepared by direct compression of micronized CCI-779 formulations of the invention exhibited rapid and complete drug release, as compared to nonmicronized CCI-779, even when the nonmicronized CCI-779 was formulated with surfactants. See, e.g., Example 4. Thus, the compositions of the invention provide fast drug release.<br>

WO 2005/070393	PCT/US2004/042178<br>
Briefly, CCI-779 is micronized under nitrogen and conventional micronizing tecliniques, for example with a Trost or jet mill, applied to non-micronized CCI-779. The preparation of non-micronized CCI-779 is described in U.S. Patent 5,362,718, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A regioselective preparation of non-micronized CCI-779 is described in US Patent 6,277,983, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, the invention is not limited to the method by which the non-micronized CCI-779 is produced. Micronized CCI-779 typically has a particle size of about 0.2 to about 30 microns, about 0.5 to 25 microns, or about 0.5 to 20 microns, as described above.<br>
The compositions of the invention contain micronized CCI-779 with a particle size range in which 10% are less than or equal to about 3 microns (j.i). 50% are about 10 u, and 90% are less than or equal to about 20 JJ. as determined by Malvern method. In one embodiment, the micronized CCI-779 has a particle size range of 10% are less man or equal to about 2 m., 50% are about 5 m, and 90% are less than or equal to about 16 m as determined by Malvern method.<br>
Suitably, the micronized CCI-779 is present in the composition of the invention in an amount from 0.1 % w/w to 50% w/w, based on the weight of an uncoated composition of the invention. This amount may be varied, depending upon the amount of micronized CCI-779 to be delivered to a patient. For example, an effective amount of micronized CCI-779 is generally in the range, e.g., about 0.1 to about 50 mg, about 10 mg to about 30 mg, or about 0.5 to about 2 mg micronized CCI-779. The desired therapeutic regimen can be taken into consideration when formulating a composition of the invention. For example, micronized CCI-779 can be in the range of 0.1% w/w to 10% w/w for an uncoated composition of the invention, hi another example, micronized CCI-779 can be in the range of 5% w/w to 25% w/w based upon the weight of an uncoated unit dose. In yet another example, micronized CCI-779 can be in the range of 6% w/w to S% w/w, 15% w/w to 40% w/w, or 20% w/w to 30% w/w based on the weight of an uncoated unit dose.<br>
In addition to containing micronized CCI-779, the composition of the present invention can contain pharmaceuticaly acceptable additives and/or excipients. Typically, these additives are biologically inert and useful for manufacture of a dosing<br>

' EXAMPLE 4 - Dissolution of CCI-779 Tablets<br>
All the CCI-779 tablet formulations were evaluated by dissolution test. Dissolution test was performed using USP method II in 500 ml of 0.4% sodium lauryl sulfate at 75 RPM paddle speed. Table 6 summarizes the dissolution characteristics of the neat CCI-779 API and various tablet formulations of CCI-779.<br>

* Pure CCI-779 was filled in hard gelatin capsules to test its dissolution.<br>
Dissolution results in Table 6 show that the tablets prepared by direct compression method (Table 1) did not exhibit rapid and complete drug release. Even the addition of a surfactant (Table 2) did not enhance dissolution of CCI-779 from these tablets. However, the directly compressible compositions of the invention containing micronized CCI-779 (Tables 3, 4, 5) exhibited fast and complete drug release.<br>
