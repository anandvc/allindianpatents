				<td>CATALYST COMPRISING AN EUO ZEOLITE, A 10 MR ZEOLITE AND A 12 MR ZEOLITE, AND ITS USE IN ISOMERIZING AROMATIC C8 COMPOUNDS<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst formed from at least three distinct zeolites for use, for example, in aromatic hydrocarbon transformation reactions. More precisely, it concerns a catalyst for isomerizing C8 aromatic compounds. The present invention also relates to the use of said catalyst in a process for isomerizing a feed comprising aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule. Prior art<br>
In known processes for isomerizing aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms (ACS), a feed which is generally low in para-xylene with respect to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the mixture {i.e. with a much lower para-xylene content than that of a mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium at the temperature under consideration, that mixture comprising at least one compound selected from the group formed by meta-xylene, ortho-xylene, para-xylene and ethylbenzene) and generally rich in ethylbenzene compared with that same mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium, is introduced into a reactor containing at least one catalyst, under suitable temperature and pressure conditions to obtain at the reactor outlet a composition of aromatic compounds contaming eight carbon atoms which is as close as possible to the composition of said mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium at the temperature of the reactor. To obtain such a composition, the skilled person isgenerally constrained to maximise the conversion of ethylbenzene present in the feed. From the mixture obtained at the outlet from the isomerization reactor, xylene is separated, possibly along with meta-xylene or ortho-xylene which are the desired isomers as they are of great importance, in particular for the synthetic fibre industry.<br>
The catalysts used to carry out a process for isomerizing aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms are generally zeolitic catalysts. Prior art catalysts, in particular catalysts based on mordenite zeolite, only produce mediocre catalytic performances as non-negligible side reactions occurring in their presence generate losses. An example which may be cited of such secondary reactions is naphthene ring opening, which may or may not be followed by cracking (losses to paraffins) or disproportionation and transalkylation reactions of aromatics containing eight carbon atoms (losses to unwanted aromatic compounds), or hydrogenation of aromatic compounds (losses to naphthenes). Catalysts based on ZSM-5 zeolite, alone or mixed with other zeolites such as mordenite, for example, have already been<br>
 <br>
used but also do not produce optimum catalytic performances.  More recently, a catalyst has<br>
been proposed which is based on a zeolite with structure type EUO (EP-Al-0 923 987). The<br>
present invention thus proposes to provide a novel catalyst with a composition such that when<br>
it is used to isomerize aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule, the<br>
ethylbenzene conversion is improved and secondary reactions are limited, thereby reducing<br>
losses.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a catalyst comprising at least one zeolite with structure type EUO, at least one zeolite having channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 10 oxygen atoms (10 MR), at least one zeolite having channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 12 oxygen atoms (12 MR) and at least one porous mineral matrix. Advantageously, the catalyst of the invention comprises at least one metal selected from metals from groups VTB, VIIB and VIII of the periodic table of the elements, and optionally also at least one metal selected fi-om metals from groups lUA and IVA of the periodic table of the elements. Each of the zeolites included in the catalyst of the invention contains silicon and at least one element T selected from the group formed by aluminium, iron, gallium and boron, preferably aluminium.<br>
The present invention also  concerns the use of said catalyst in a process for isomerizing a feed comprising aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule. Advantage of the invention<br>
It has surprisingly been discovered that a composite catalyst comprising a combination of at least one zeolite with structure type EUO, at least one zeolite havmg channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 20 oxygen atoms (10 MR), and at least one zeolite having channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 12 oxygen atoms (12 MR) results in improved catalytic performances in reactions for isomerizing aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule. In particular, the catalyst of the invention leads to an ethylbenzene conversion which is higher than that achieved by prior art catalysts, in particular catalysts based on a zeolite with structure type EUO or structure type MOR. Fxirther, the catalyst of ttie invention limits secondary reactions substantially, thereby generating fewer losses, compared with prior art catalysts.<br>
 <br>
Further, by adjusting the relative quantity of the three zeolites, namely that with structure type EUO, that with 10 MR and that with 12 MR, in the catalyst of the invention, it is possible to process a very wide range of mixtures of hydrocarbon feeds. Description<br>
The present invention provides a catalyst comprising at least one zeolite with structure type EUO, at least one zeolite having channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 10 oxygen atoms (10 MR), at least one zeolite having channels the opening to which is defined by a ring of 12 oxygen atoms (12 MR) and at least one porous mineral matrix.<br>

The porous mineral matrix is generally selected from elements from the group formed by clays (for example from natural clays such as kaolin, sepiolite, attapulgite or bentonite), magnesia, aluminas, silicas, titanium oxide, boron oxide, zirconia,   aluminium   phosphates,   titanium   phosphates,   zirconium phosphates, amorphous silica aluminas and coal, preferably of elements from the group formed by aluminas, clays, mixtures of alumina and silica and mixtures of alumina and silica alumina, more preferably from aluminas and in particular gamma alumina. In general, and in a first implementation of the process for preparing a catalyst of the invention, the catalyst is prepared by mixing at least one zeolite with structure type EUO, at Jeast one 10 MR zeolite and at least one 12 MR zeolite, and at least one optional 8 MR zeolite, said zeolites being in the powder state. The mixture of said zeolites is produced using any powder mixing technique known to the skilled person.   Once the mixture of zeolite powders has been produced, the mixture is formed using any technique which is known to the skilled person.    In particular, it may be mixed with a porous mineral matrix, generally amorphous, for example with a moist alumina gel powder.  The mixture is then formed, for example by extrusion through a die.   Forming may be carried out with matrices other than alumina, such as magnesia, amorphous silica-aluminas, natural clays (kaolin, bentonite, sepiolite, attapulgite), silica, titanium oxide, boron oxide, zirconia, alimiinium phosphates, titanium phosphates, zirconium phosphates, coal and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, matrices containing alumina are used, in any of the forms known to the skilled person, and more preferably gamma alumina.   It may also be advantageous to use mixtures of alumina and silica, or mixtures of alumina and silica-alumina.   Techniques other than extrusion, such as pelletization or bowl granulation, may be employed.   After the forming step, fee catalyst obtained undergoes a drying step carried out at a temperature in the range 80°C to 150oC then a calcming step carried out at a temperature in fee range 300°C to 600°C, preferably in fee range 400°C to 550°C.<br>
In fee case in which fee catalyst of fee invention comprises at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIll of fee periodic table of fee elements, said metal(s) is (are) deposited on a catalytic support after forming fee zeolites which are free of metals, using any process which is known to fee skilled person and which can allow a metal<br>
 <br>
to be deposited onto the catalytic support. The term "catalytic support" means a mixture of zeolites (free of metals) with at least one porous mineral matrix after fonning, drying and calcining as described above. Said catalytic support of the catalyst of the present invention generally has the following quantities of matrix and zeolites:<br>
•	1% to 90% by weight, preferably 3% to 60% by weight, more preferably 3% to 40% by weight of zeolites such that at least one zeolite is a zeolite with structure type EUO, at least one zeolite is a zeolite selected from 10 MR zeolites, at least one zeolite is selected from 12 MR zeolites and optionally at least one zeolite is selected from 8 MR zeolites;<br>
•	10% to 99% by weight, preferably 40% to 97% by weight, more preferably 60% to 97% by weight of at least one amorphous or low crystallinity oxide type porous mineral matrix.<br>
A second implementation of the process for preparing a catalyst of the invention, in the preferred case in which said catalyst comprises at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIII of the periodic table of the elements, consists of subjecting at least one of the zeolites described above and comprised in said catalyst to deposition of at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VTIB and VIII, prior to forming the zeolite ensemble.<br>
Preferably, at least one EU-1 zeolite is subjected to deposition of at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and vni. It is also advantageous to deposit on the 10 MR zeolite at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIII and to deposit on the 12 MR zeolite at least one other metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIII. It is also advantageous, in the second implementation of the process for preparing the catalyst of the invention, to deposit, on each of the zeolites present in the catalyst of the invention, the same metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIII, preferably to deposit at least one metal from group VIII and more preferably to deposit platinum. The mixture of these zeolites, which are then in the powder state, at least one of the zeolites being charged with metal{s), is produced using any powder mixing technique which is known to the skilled person. Once the mixture of zeolite powders has been formed, wherein at least one of the powders is charged with metal(s), the mixture is formed using any technique which is known to the skilled person. In particular, it may be mixed with a porous mineral matrix, generally amorphotas, for example a moist alumina gel powder.   The mixture<br>
 <br>
is then fonned, for example by extrusion through a die. Forming may be carried out with matrices other than alumina, such as magnesia, amorphous silica-aluminas, natural clays (kaolin, bentonite, sepiolite, attapulgite), silica, titanium oxide, boron oxide, zirconia, aluminium phosphates, titanium phosphates, zirconiuim phosphates, coal and mixtures thereof, for example. Preferably, matrices containing alumina are used, in any of the forms known to the skilled person, and more preferably gamma alumina. It may also be advantageous to use mixtures of alumina and silica, or mixtures of alumina and silica-alumina. Techniques other than extrusion, such as pelletization or bowl granulation, may be losed. After the forming step, the product obtained undergoes a drying step carried out at a temperature in the range 80°C to 150°C then a calcining step carried out at a temperature in the range 300°C to 600oC, preferably in the range 400°C to 550°C.<br>
To deposit the metal on at least one zeolite as described above and/or onto the catalytic support in accordance with the first or the second implementation of the process for preparing the catalyst of the invention, it is possible to use a technique for cationic exchange with competition, wherein the competitor is preferably ammonium nitrate, the competition ratio between the competitor and the metallic precursor being at least about 5 and advantageously in the range 5 to 200. The dry impregnation or co-precipitation technique may also be used.<br>
The sources of group VIII metals which may be used are well known to the skilled person, Examples which may be used are nitrates, sulphates, phosphates, halides, for example chlorides, bromides or fluorides, carboxylates, for example acetates, and carbonates. In the case of platinum, hexachloroplatinic acid or platinum tetramine is preferably used. Sources of group VIIB metals which may be used are also well known to the skilled person. In the case of rhenium, an ammoniijm perrhenate complex (NH4)Re04 or perrhenic acid is usually used. Sources of metals from group VIB which may be used are also well known to the skilled person. In the case of molybdenum, it is possible to use molybdic adds and their salts, in particular their ammonium salts such as ammonium molybdate, ammonium heptamolybdate as well as phosphomolybdic acid. Preferably, ammonium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7024 is used. Deposition of the metal(s) is generally followed by calcining in air or oxygen, usually between 300°C and 600°C for 0.5 to 10 hours, preferably between 350°C and 550°C for 1 to 4 hours. Next, reduction in hydrogen may be carried out, generally at a temperature in the range 300°C to 600°C for 1 to 10 hours, preferably between 350°C and 550^C for 2 to 5 hours.<br>
 <br>
In the first or said second implementation for preparing the catalyst of the invention, and in the preferred case in which said catalyst comprises at least one metal selected from metals from groups VIB, VIIB and VIII of the periodic table of the elements and at least one optional additional metal selected from metals from groups IIIA and TV A, the metals may also be deposited not directly on the zeolites but on the porous mineral matrix (for example the alumina binder) of the catalytic support formed by the three zeolites, optionally the four zeolites, and at least one matrix, before or after the forming step, using anionic exchange. An example which may be cited in the case of dqiosition of platinum is the use of the hexachloroplatinic complex HattCls and in the case of deposition of rhenium, the use of perrhenic acid HRe04. In general, after depositing the meta](s), as before, the catalyst undergoes calcining then reduction in hydrogen as indicated above.<br>
When the catalyst of the invention contains several metals, they may be introduced either in the same manner or using different techniques, before or after forming depending on the catalyst preparation mode employed, and in any order. In the case in which the technique used is ion exchange, several exchanges in succession may be necessary to introduce the required quantities of metals.<br>
Regardless of the mode for preparing the catalyst of the invention, after calcining said catalyst, reduction may be carried out in hydrogen, generally at a temperature in the range 300°C to 600°C, preferably in the range 350°C to 550°C, for a period in the range 1 to 10 hours, preferably 2 to 5 hours. Such a reduction may be carried out ex situ or in situ, with respect to the place of use of said catalyst in a given reaction.<br>
The distribution between the three zeolites, optionally the four zeolites, of each of the groups defined above is such that the amount of each of the zeolites present in the catalyst of the invention can be between 1% and 98% by weight, preferably 2% to 60% by weight and more preferably 4% to 50% by weight, as a percentage by weight of a zeolite with respect to the ensemble of the zeolites introduced into the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention is formed into grains with different shapes and dimensions. It is generally used in the form of cylindrical extrudates or polylobed extrudates such as bilobes, trilobes, or polylobes with a straight or twisted shape, but may optionally be manufactured and used in the form of powder, pellets, tablets, rings, beads or wheels.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may optionally contain sulphur. In this case, the sulphur is introduced, into the formed and calcined catalyst containing the element{s) cited above, either m situ before the catalytic reaction or ex situ. Sulphurization is carried out using<br>
 <br>
any sulphurizing agent which is known to the skilled person, such as dimethyldisulphide or hydrogen sulphide. Any sulphurization is carried out after reduction. In the case of in situ sulphurization, if the catalyst has not already been reduced, reduction is carried out before sulphurization. In the case of ex situ sulphurization, reduction is carried out followed by sulphurization.<br>
The invention also concerns the use of the catalyst of the invention in processes for converting hydrocarbons. More precisely, the present invention concerns a process for isomerizing a feed comprising aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule carried out in the presence of a catalyst in accordance with the invention. Said feed comprises a mixture of xylenes and ethylbenzene. Said process is carried out in the gas phase, preferably in the absence of any liquid phase. Said process is generally carried out under the following operating conditions:<br>
•	a tempaature in the range 300°C to 500°C, preferably in the range 320°C to 450'C and more preferably in the range 340°C to 430°C;<br>
•	a partial pressure of hydrogen in the range 0.3 to 1.5 MPa, preferably in the range 0.4 to 1.2 MPa and more preferably in the range 0.7 to 1.2 MPa;<br>
•	a total pressure in the range 0.45 to 1.9 MPa, preferably in the range 0.6 to 1.5 MPa;<br>
•	an hourly space velocity, expressed in kilograms of feed introduced per kilogram of catalyst per hour, in the range 0.25 to 30 h"', preferably in the range 1 to 10 h-1', and more preferably in the range 2 to 6h"'.<br>
The following examples illxjstrate the invention without in any way limiting its scope. EXAMPLE 1: Preparation of a catalyst based on a zeolite with structure type EUO (comparative)<br>
The starting material used was an as synthesised EU-1 zeolite comprising an organic template, silicon and aluminium, with an overall Si/Al atomic ratio of 13.6, a sodium weight content with respect to the weight of dry EU-1 zeolite of about 1.5%, corresponding to a Na/Al atomic ratio of 0.6. This EU-1 zeolite initially underwent dry calcining at 550°C in a stream of air for 6 hours. Next, the solid obtained underwent three ion exchanges in a ION NH4NO3 solution at about lOO^C for 4 hours for each exchange. At the end of these treatments, flie EU-1 zeolite in the NH4NO3 form had an overall Si/Al atomic ratio of 18.3, and a sodium weight content with respect to the weight of dry EU-1 zeolite of 50 ppm,<br>
 <br>
corresponding to a Na'Al atomic ratio of 0.003. The EU-1 zeolite was then formed by extrusion with an alumina gel to obtain, after drying and calcining in dry air, the support constituted by extrudates 1.4 mm in diameter, which contained 15% by weight of EU-1 zeolite in the H form and 85% of alumina.<br>
The support obtained underwent anionic exchange with hexachloroplatlnic acid in the presence of a competing agent {hydrochloric acid), to introduce 0.3% by weight of platinum with respect to the weight of catalyst. The moist solid was then dried at 120°C for 12 hours and calcined in a flow of dry air at a temperature of 500oC for one hour. The catalyst CO thus obtained contained 15.0% by weight of EU-1 zeolite m the H form, 84.7% by weight of alumina and 0.3% by weight of platinum.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Preparation of catalysts based on zeolite with structure type EUO, a 10 MR zeolite and a 12 MR zeolite (in accordance with the invention).<br>
The zeolites used to prepare the catalysts illustrating the invention are shown in Table 1 with their composition (Si/Al atomic ratio) and their residual sodium content. The zeolites concerned are in the acid form.<br>
The EU-1 zeolite was synthesized in the maimer described in Example 1. After calcining in air at 550°C then after 3 ion exchanges in a 1 ON NH4NO3 solution for 4 h, it had a Si/Al atomic ratio of 18.3 and aNa/Al atomic ratio of 0.003, corresponding to aNa content of 50ppm.<br>
The beta, mordenite, Y and ZSM-5 zeolites were commercially available zeolites (Zeolyst).<br>
The NU-87 zeolite was synthesized in accordance with European patent apphcation EP-A-0 377 291 or EP-B-0 378 916. It had an overall Si/Al atomic ratio of 17.2 and a sodium content of 1256 ppm by weight. This NU-87 zeolite initially underwent dry caldning at 550°C in a stream of air and nitrogen for 6 hours. Next, the solid obtained underwent ion exchange in a ION NH4NO3 solution at about lOO^'C for 4 hours. The NU-87 zeolite then underwent a treatment with a 7N nitric acid solution at about 100°C for 5 hours. The volume V of the nitric acid employed (in ml) was 10 times the weight W of the dry NU87 zeolite (V/W = 10). This treatment with a 7N nitric acid solution was carried out a second time tinder the same operating conditions<br>
At the end of these treatments, the zeolite obtained was in its H form and had an overall Si/Al atomic ratio of 33.3 and aNa content of 10 ppm.<br>
 <br>
The IM-5 zeolite was synthesized as described in Example 1 of patent apphcation EP-A-0 946 416 or US-A-6 136 290, the contents of each of those documents being hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
 <br>
The zeolites, which were in the powdered state, were mechanically mixed then formed by extrusion with an alumina gel to obtain, after drying at 100oC overnight and calcining at 500°C in dry air, a support which contained, by weight, 15% of zeolites {each support containing an EU-J zeolite, a 10 MR zeolite and a 12 MR zeolite) and 85% alumina. The zeolitic portion of the support was constituted by a mechanical mixture of three different zeolites, produced before forming. The weigiht distribution of the zeolites in the zeolitic support and the type of zeolites present in each support are given in Table 2.<br>
To prepare catalysts C2 to C8, the zeolitic support comprising a mixture of three different zeolites, namely at least one zeohte with structure type EUO, at least one 10 MR zeolite and at least one 12 MR zeolite, underwent dry impregnation using a solution of a metallic precursor, either a solution of hexachloroplatinic acid HaPtCl6 when the metal was platinum (CI to C5 and C8) or a solution of perrhenic acid when the metal was rhenium (C6 and CI). For catalyst C7, indium was deposited by dry impregnation with indium chloride deposited onto the support after dry impregnation of rhenium and drying at 120°C overnight. For catalyst C8, tin was deposited by dry impregnation of tin chloride deposited onto the support after dry impregnation of Pt and drying overnight at 120°C.<br>
After depositing all the metals on the various supports, each moist solid was then dried at 120°C for 12 hours and calcined in a stream of dry air at a temperature of 500°C for one hour. The composition of the catalysts obtained is shown in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 3: Evaluation of catalytic properties of catalysts CO to C8 by isomerization of an aromatic C8 cut.<br>
The performances of catalysts CO to C8 were evaluated by isomerizing an aromatic cut comprising aromatic compounds containing eight carbon atoms per molecule, principally meta-xylene, ortho-xylene and ethylbenzene. The operating conditions employed were as follows:<br>
•	temperature =390°C;<br>
•	pressure = 15 bars;<br>
•	partial pressure of H2 = 12 bars.<br>
Tbe catalysts were pre-treated with a feed containing dimethyldisulphide (DMDS) in the presence of hydrogen, with a concentration such that the atomic ratio of sulphur to metal was 1.5. The catalysts were then kept for 3 hours at 400°C in a stream of hydrogen and the feed was then injected.<br>
The catalysts were compared in terms of activity by ethylbenzene conversion and in terms of selectivity by the net losses at quasi iso-equlibrium of para-xylene.<br>
The isomerization reaction leads to side reactions generating three types of losses: losses to paraffins, essentially resulting from naphthene ring opening reactions followed by cracking, losses to aromatics formed by disproportionation and transalkylation of aromatics containing 8 carbon atoms (ACS), and finally losses to napthenes including napthenes containing 8 carbon atoms (N8) due to aromatic hydrogenation.    Since the N8s can be<br>
 <br>
recycled, the losses by cracking and disproportionation/transalkylation including naphthenes other than N8 (the sum of which constitutes the net losses) will be compared.<br>
The losses by cracking (PI) are losses of ACS in the form of paraffins (PAR) containing one to eight carbon atoms:<br>
P1 (wt %) = 100 X [(%PAReffiueut X effluent weight) - (%PARfeed x weight of feed)]/(%AC8feed x wt of feed).<br>
The losses by disproportionation/transalkylation (P2) are losses of ACS in the form of naphthenes other than N8, of toluene, of benzene and of C9+ aromatics (OAN):<br>
P2 (wt %) = 100 X [(%OANefflu«t X efQuent weight) - (%OANfe«i x weight of feed)y(%AC8fe«i x wt of feed).<br>
The sxrni of losses PI and P2 represents the net losses.<br>
The data shown in Table 3 were obtained at iso-experimental conditions and quasi iso-equlibrium (98%).<br>
 <br>
Catalysts C1 to C8 of the invention, which each comprised a zeolite with structure type EUO, a 10 MR zeolite and a 12 MR zeolite, produced better conversions of ethylbenzene and a reduction in net losses meaning that secondary reactions were limited compared with the performances obtained xising a catalyst CO which was based on only one zeolite with structure type EUO. The introdution of a metal, platinum or rhenium, onto the support (C2 to C6) also reduced the net losses and improved the ethylbenzene conversion compared with a catalyst C1 which was free of metal. The introduction of an additional metal, tin or indium (C8, C7 respectively) reduced the net losses even more significantiy and further unproved the ethylbenzene conversion compared with the performances obtained with a catalyst containing only a single metal (C3, C6 respectively).<br>
