Background of the invention<br>
A sealant is a substance used to sea! joints the commonly known type is the asbestos Seaia nt.<br>
This invention relates to an Asbestos Free Sealant and a process for preparation of an asbestos free sealant material suitable for the use of Fuel injection pumps, to enhance the seating effect in ait critical points.<br>
Known Prior Art<br>
Currently in fuel injection pumps. Asbestos sealants are being used to seal the critical joints. The sealing agent is expected to hold the lubricating oil inside the pump and possess adequate compression strength, high and low temperature resistance and temperature shock, controlled swelling behaviour in oil, vibration resistance, fuel resistance, etc<br>
The asbestos is carcinogenic. The disadvantage is that It has adverse effect on human skin and is health hazardous.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a new sealant, wherein use of Asbestos is eliminated and to make it environment friendly.<br>
It is another object of the invention to arrive at an end product whose quality is better than currently available.<br>
It is another object of the invention, in the context of present trend in the international arena towards elimination of Asbestos in sealant preparation, to prepare Asbestos free sealant.<br><br>
According to the invention, the enhanced quality of the sealant originates from the composition and also from the controlled process which has been developed by the inventors.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to the invention, the sheet for sealant is formed by Mixing (Dry Process) and Hot Calendering process. During the process, the necessary ingredients are added in required quantity and sequence while maintaining the process parameters to the specified values.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The sealant, according to invention carried out for resolving the aforementioned disadvantages, involves the said process comprising of steps :-<br>
a.	Dry mixing (Dry Process),<br>
b.	Hot Calendering Process (Dry Process)<br>
The process is now described herein below in its broadest scopes and aspect and the possible variant features and characteristics of the invention are described along with equivalent features and characteristics in the preferred embodiment<br>
Step 1: Mixing &amp; Milling Process<br>
In this Process, the natural rubber is masticated by which the material is permanently softened for further mixing with the nitrite rubber in the required ratio. The mastication is carried out at 45 - 50 rpm and pressure 2.3 - 3 bar. With this, the binder, which is a combination of natural and nitrite rubber is ready for use.<br><br>
Step 2: Chopping and Mixing process<br>
The synthetic pulp fe chopped to shorten the length by chopping after the fillers are mixed in the required ratio in a mixer for uniform mixing to avoid agglomeration of the pulp which is essential for the smooth, uniform surface finish of the end product. The binder (a mixture of nitrite and natural rubber ds ly4 - pofyisoprene.) &amp; other vulcanising chemicals are mixed and the mixing ts continued for 10 mins at low rpm mode to ensure that a uniform distribution is achieved.<br>
In this process, 2 different compositions are prepared for the manufacture of the sheet as a 3 layer system termed as w XYX" layers where in the * X &amp; X" are the outer layers having the same composition and the " Y" layer, middle layer or body layer which contributes the major portion of the required thickness in having a different composition.<br>
Each mix is prepared separately and made into a dough form by adding Toulene (375 - 400 ml.) and the mixing is continued for 2 - 3 mins for uniform mix. Care is be token that the temperature does not exceed beyond 35° C to avoid premature reaction of the vulcanising chemicals.<br>
