ADJUVANT COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN IMMUNOSTIMULATORY OLIGONUCLEOTIDE AND A TOCOL<br>
The present invention relates to novel adjuvant compositions for use in vaccines. In particular, the adjuvant compositions of the present invention comprise a combination of an immunostimulatory ofigonucleotide and a tocol. Also provided by the present invention are vaccines comprising the adjuvant compositions of the present invention and at least one antigen. Further provided are methods of manufacture of the adjuvant compositions and vaccines of the present invention and their use as medicaments. Additionally, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual susceptible to or suffering from a disease by the parenteral or mucosal administration of the vaccines of the present invention.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides containing uamethylated CpG dinucleotides ("CpG11) and are known adjuvants when administered by both systemic and mucosal routes (WO 96/02555.. EP 468520, Davis et ai, J.Immunol, 1998, I60(2):870-876: McCluskie and Davis, J.Immunol, 1998., 161(9):4463-6). CpG is an abbreviation for cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide motifs present in DNA. Historically. it was observed that the DNA fraction of BCG could exert an anti-tumour effect.  In further studies, synthetic oligonucleotides derived from BCG gene sequences were shown to be capable of inducing immunostimulatory effects (both in vitro and in vivo). The authors of these studies concluded that certain palindromic sequences, including a central CG motif, carried this activity. The central role of the CG motif in lmmunostimulation was later elucidated in a publication by Krieg, Nature 374. p546 1995. Detailed analysis has shown that the CG motif has to be in a certain sequence context, and that such sequences are common in bacterial DNA but are rare in vertebrate DNA. The immunostimulatory sequence is often:  Purine, Purine, C, G. pyrimidine, pyrimidine; wherein the dinucleotide CG motif is not methylated, but other unmethylated CpG sequences are known to be immunostimulatory and may be used in the present invention.<br>
In certain combinations of the six nucleotides a palindromic sequence is present. Several of these motifs, either as repeats of one motif or a combination of different motifs, can be present in the same oligonucleotide. The presence of one or more of these immunostimulatory sequence containing oligonucleotides can activate various immune subsets, including natural killer cells (which produce interferon y and<br>
1<br><br>
have cytolytic activity) and macrophages (Wooldrige et al Vol 89 (no. 8)   1977) Although other unmethylated CpG containing sequences not having this consensus sequence have now been shown to be immunomodulatory.<br>
CpG when formulated into vaccines, is generally administered in free solution together with free antigen (WO 96/02555; McCluskie and Davis, supra) or covalently conjugated to an antigen (PCT Publication No. WO 98/16247), or formulated with a carrier such as aluminium hydroxide ((Hepatitis surface antigen) Davis et at. supra ; Brazolot-Millan et al.. Proc Natl.AcadSci, USA. 1998. 95(26), 15553-8). Other CpG containing formulations include those described in WO 99/61056 and WO 00/09159.<br>
Tocols (vitamin E) and emulsion adjuvants comprising them are described in EP 0 382 271 Bl and US5667784.<br>
Oil emulsion adjuvants have been known for many years, including work on Freunds complete and incomplete mineral oil emulsion adjuvants. Since that time much work, has been performed to design stable and well tolerated alternatives to these potent, but reactogenic. adjuvant formulations. Oil emulsions comprising tocols are described in WO 95/17210.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising finding that combinations of immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and tocols form extremely potent adjuvant formulations. The components of these adjuvant formulations preferably interact synergistically in the induction of antigen specific antibody and are potent in the induction of immune responses conventionally associated with the Thl-type immune system. Accordingly, the adjuvant combinations are not only suitable for immunoprophylaxis of diseases, but also surprisingly for immunotherapy of diseases such as persistent viral, bacterial or parasitic infections, and also chronic disorders such as cancer.<br>
The immunostimulatory sequence is often: Purine, Purine, C, G, pyrimidine. pyrimidine; wherein the dinucleotide CG motif is not methylated . The preferred oligonucleotides For use in adjuvants or vaccines of the present invention preferably contain two or more dinucleotide CpG motifs separated by at least three, more preferably at least six or more nucleotides. The oligonucleotides of the present invention are typically deoxynucleotides. In a preferred embodiment the internucleotide in the oligonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or more preferably a phosphorothioate bond, although phosphodiester and other internucleotide bonds are within the scope of the invention including oligonucleotides with mixed<br><br>
intemucleotide linkages. Methods for producing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides or<br>
phosphorodithioate are described in US5.666J53, US5,278,302 and WO95/26204.    ¦ Examples of preferred oligonucleotides have the following sequences. The<br>
sequences preferably contain phosphorothioate modified intemucleotide linkages. OLIGO I(SEQ ID NO: I): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT (CpG 1826) OUGO 2 (SEQ ID NO:2): TCT CCC AGC GTG CGC CAT (CpG 1758) OLIGO 3(SEQ ID NO:3): ACC GAT GAC GTC GCC GGT GAC GGC ACC ACG OLIGO 4 (SEQ ID NO:4): TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (CpG 2006) OLIGO 5 (SEQ ID NO:5): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT (CpG 1668) Alternative CpG oligonucleotides may comprise the preferred sequences<br>
above in that they have inconsequential deletions or additions thereto.<br>
The CpG oligonucleotides utilised in the present invention may be synthesised by any<br>
method known in the art (e.g. EP 468520). Conveniently, such oligonucleotides may<br>
be synthesised utilising an automated synthesiser.<br>
The oligonucleotides utilised in the present invention are typically<br>
deoxynucleotides. In a preferred embodiment the intemucleotide bond in the<br>
oligonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or more preferably phosphorothioate bond,<br>
although phosphodiesters are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Oligonucleotide comprising different intemucieotide linkages are contemplated, e.g.<br>
mixed phosphorothioate phosphodiesters. Other intemucleotide bonds which stabilise<br>
the oligonucleotide may be used.<br>
The tocols that may advantageously be used in the adjuvant combinations of<br>
the present invention are described in EP 0 382 271 Bl. The tocols disclosed therein<br>
are described by the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R may be H or one or more identical or different substituents chosen from the group comprising alkyl, alkoxy. acyloxy, hydroxy. a sulphate and a phosphate group; [11 and R3 independently of one another are H or alkyl; R2 is H or alkyl and may be different in each unit; the broken line indicates the presence or absence of an<br>
3<br><br>
additional carbon-carbon bond in a unit; and n= the value 1 to 10. The alkyl group in R, Rl. R2 and R3 may be chosen in particular from a linear or branched carbon chain having 1-4 carbon atoms , such as methyl, ethyl, butyl or isobutyl.<br>
The further defined preferred subgroups described in EP 0 382 271 Bl are incorporated herein by reference. A particularly preferred tocol is D, L. a-tocopherol (CAS No. 10191-41-0; chemical name: (2RS,4'RS, 8*RS)-2, 5, 7, 8-tetramethyl-2-(4*. 8\ 12Mrimethyl-tridecyl)-6-chromanol)); which is commercially available from ROCHE™.<br>
Preferably the tocol is in the form of an oil emulsion, and more preferably an oil in water emulsion. The tocols may be formulated as described in EP 0 382 271 Bl. in that the tocols may be dispersions of tocol droplets, optionally comprising an emulsifier. of preferably less than 1 micron in diameter. Alternatively, the tocols may be used in combination with another oil, to form the oil phase of an oil emulsion. Examples of oil emulsions which may be used in combination with the tocoJ are described below.<br>
Oil in water emulsion adjuvants per se have been suggested to be useful as adjuvant compositions (EP 0 399 843B), also combinations of oil in water emulsions and other active agents have been described as adjuvants for vaccines (WO 95/17210; WO 98/56414; WO 99/12565; WO 99/11241). Other oil emulsion adjuvants have been described, such as water in oil emulsions (US 5,422,109; EP 0 480 982 B2) and water in oil in water emulsions (US 5,424,067; EP 0 480 981 B). AJ1 of which form preferred oil emulsion systems to incorporate tocols, and ultimately to be combined with CpG, to form adjuvants of the present invention.<br>
The choice of the oil, for combination with the tocol, may be natural or synthetic, and may be mineral or organic. Examples of mineral and organic oils will be readily apparent to the man skilled in the art.<br>
The oil phase of the emulsion system preferably comprises a metabolisable oil. The meaning of the term metabolisable oil is well known in the art. Metabolisable can be defined as "'being capable of being transformed by metabolism" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, W.B. Sanders Company, 25th edition (1974)). The oil may be any vegetable oil, fish oil, animal oil or synthetic oil, which is not toxic to the recipient and is capable of being transformed by metabolism. Nuts (such as peanut oil), seeds, and grains are common sources of vegetable oils. Synthetic oils are also<br>
4<br><br>
part of this invention and can include commercially available oils such as NEOBEE® and others. Squalene (2,6,10,15,19,23-Hexamethyl-2.6,l0,14,18,22-tetracosaliexaene) is an unsaturated oil which is found in large quantities in shark-liver oil, and in lower quantities in olive oil. wheat germ oil,.rice bran oil. and yeast, and is a particularly preferred oil for use in this invention. Squalene is a metabolisable oil virtue of the fact that it is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (Merck index, 10th Edition, entry no.8619).<br>
Particularly preferred oil emulsions for combination with CpG to form adjuvants of the present invention are oil in water emulsions, and in particular squalene in water emulsions, which comprise a tocol and an emuisifier.<br>
Examples of preferred emulsion systems are described in WO 95/17210 and WO 99/11241 which disclose emulsion adjuvants based on squalene, a-tocopherol. and TWEEN 80, optionally formulated with the immunostimulants QS21 and/or 3D-MPL.<br>
The size of the oil droplets found within the stable oil in water emulsion are preferably less than 1 micron, may be in the range of substantially 30-600nm, preferably substantially around 30-500nm in diameter, and most preferably substantially I50-500nm in diameter, and in particular about 150 run in diameter as measured by photon correlation spectroscopy. In this regard. 80% of the oil droplets by number should be within the preferred ranges, more preferably more than 90% and most preferably more than 95% of the oil droplets by number are within the defined size ranges. The amounts of the components present in the oil emulsions of the present invention are conventionally in the range of from 2 to 10% oil, such as squalene; and when present, from 2 to 10% alpha tocopherol; and from 0.3 to 3% surfa_ctant, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.  Preferably the ratio of oil (preferably squalene): tocol (preferably a-tocopherol) is equal or less than 1 as this provides a more stable emulsion. An emuisifier, such as Tween80 or Span 85 may also be present at a level of about 1%.  In some cases it may be advantageous that the vaccines of the present invention will further contain a stabiliser.<br>
The method of producing oil in water emulsions is well known to the man skilled in the art Commonly, the method comprises the mixing the tocol-containing oil phase with a surfactant such as a PBS/TWEEN80™ solution, followed by homogenisation using a homogenizer, it would be clear to a man skilled in the art that<br>
5<br><br>
a method comprising passing the mixture twice through a syringe needle would be suitable for homogenising small volumes ofliquid. Equally, the emulsification process in microfiuidiser (Ml 10S microfluidics machine, maximum of 50 passes, for a period of 2 minutes at maximum pressure input of 6 bar (output pressure of about 850 bar)) could be adapted by the man skilled in the art to produce smaller or larger volumes of emulsion. This adaptation could be achieved by routine experimentation comprising the measurement of the resultant emulsion until a preparation was achieved with oil droplets of the required diameter.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the tocol and CpG combination may additionally comprise further immunostimulants, such as LPS or derivatives thereof, or saponins. Examples of further immunostimulants are described in 'Vaccine Design - The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach" 1995, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Volume 6, Eds. Powell, M.F., and Newman. M.J., Plenum Press, New York and London, ISBN 0-306-44S67-X.<br>
Accordingly, the CpG/tocol adjuvant combinations of the present invention may advantageously include at least one enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide derived adjuvant. It has long been known that enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent stimulator of the immune system, although its use in adjuvants has been curtailed by its toxic effects. A non-toxic derivative of LPS, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), produced by removal of the core carbohydrate group and the phosphate from the reducing-end glucosamine, has been described by Ribi et al (1986, Immunology and Immunopharmacology of bacterial endotoxins. Plenum Publ. Corp., NY, p407-419) and has the following structure:<br>
6<br><br><br>
A further detoxified version of MPL results from the removal of the acyl chain from the 3-position of the disaccharide backbone, and is called 3-O-Deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). It can be purified and prepared by the methods taught in GB 2122204B, which reference also discloses the preparation of diphosphoryl lipid A, and 3-O-deacylated variants thereof. A preferred form of 3D-MPL is in the form of an emulsion having a small particle size less than 0.2um in diameter, and its method of manufacture is disclosed in WO 94/21292. Aqueous formulations comprising monophosphoryl lipid A and a surfactant have been described in WO9843670A2.<br>
The bacterial lipopolysaccharide derived adjuvants to be formulated in the adjuvant combinations of the present invention may be purified and processed from bacterial sources, or alternatively they may be synthetic. For example, purified monophosphoryl lipid A is described in Ribi et al 1986 (supra), and 3-O-Deacylated monophosphoryl or diphosphoryl lipid A derived from Salmonella sp. is described in GB 2220211 and US 4912094. Other purified and synthetic Upopolysaccharides have been described (WO 98/01139; US 6,005,099 and EP 0 729 473 Bl; Hilgers et al., 1986, Int.ArckAllergyJmtmmoL, 79(4):392-6; Hilgers et al., 1987, Immunology, 60(1): 141-6; and EP 0 549 074 Bl),  Particularly preferred bacteria!<br>
7<br><br>
lipopolysaccharide adjuvants are 3D-MPL and the p(l-6) glucosamine disaccharides described in US 6,005,099 and EP 0 729 473 Bl.<br>
Accordingly, the LPS derivatives that may be used in the present invention are those immunostimulants that are similar in structure to that of LPS or MPL or 3D-MPL. In another aspect of the present invention the LPS derivatives may be an acylated monosaccharide, which is a sub-portion to the above structure of MPL.<br>
A preferred disaccharide adjuvant is a purified or synthetic lipid A of the following formula:<br><br>
8<br>
wherein R2 may be H or PO3H2: R3 may be an acyl chain or p-hydroxymyristoyl or a 3-acyloxyacyl residue having the formula:<br><br><br>
The adjuvant compositions may also further comprise a saponin. Combinations of 3D-MPL and saponin adjuvants derived from the bark ofOuillaja Saponaria molina have been described in EP 0 761 23IB. WO 95/17210 discloses an adjuvant emulsion system based on squalene. a-tocopherol, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (TWEEN80). formulated with the immunostimulant QS21. optionally with 3D-MPL. Combinations of CpG and the adjuvant systems described in WO 95/17210 form a preferred aspect of the present invention. WO 96/33739 and WO 98/15287 describe adjuvant formulations comprising saponins and particulate carrier structures, optionally comprising 3D-MPL and/or oil in water emulsions; which when combined with a toco! and CpG form preferred adjuvants of the present invention.<br>
Saponins are known as adjuvants in vaccines for systemic administration. The adjuvant and haemolytic activity of individual saponins has been extensively studied in the art (Lacaille-Dubois and Wagner, supra). For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina), and fractions thereof, are described in US 5.057,540 and "lSaponins as vaccine adjuvants', Kensil. C. R., Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst, 1996, 12 (1-2): 1-55; and EP 0 362 279 Bl.<br>
Particulate structures, termed Immune Stimulating Complexes (ISCOMS), comprising fractions of Quil A are haemolytic and have been used in the manufacture of vaccines (Morein. B., EP 0 109 942 Bl). These structures have been reported to have adjuvant activity (EP 0 109 942 Bl; WO 96/11711).<br>
The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QSI7 (HPLC purified fractions of Quil A) have been described as potent systemic adjuvants, and the method of their production is disclosed in US Patent No.5:057:540 and EP 0 362 279 B1. Also described in these references is the use of QS7 (a non-haemolytic fraction of Quil-A) which acts as a potent adjuvant for systemic vaccines. Use of QS21 is further described in Kensil et al. (1991. J. Immunology vol 146, 431-437). Combinations of QS21 and polysorbate or cyclodextrin are also known (WO 99/10008). Particulate adjuvant systems comprising fractions of QuilA, such as QS21 and QS7 are described in WO 96/33739 and WO 96/11711. Other saponins which have been used in systemic vaccination studies include those derived from other plant species such as Gypsophila and Saponaria (Bomford etf a/., Vaccine, 10(9):572-577, 1992).<br>
9<br><br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention may optionally further comprise an additional carrier, such that the CpG may be associated with a participate carrier entity to enhance the adjuvanticity of the combination. The CpG used in the adjuvant combinations of the present invention may, therefore, be in free solution or may be complexed to particulate carriers such as mineral salts (for example, but not restricted to, aluminium or calcium salts), liposomes, ISCOMs. polymers (such as, but not restricted to polylactic. polyglycolic, polyphosphazine. polyaminoacid. alginate, chitosan) or microparticies. Preferably said carriers are cationic. The CpG may also be formulated in such as way as it associates with the tocol. or tocol containing oil emulsion. This can be achieved by formulating the emulsion in such as way that it is cationic. Alternatively the CpG may be conjugated to a iipid that associates with the oil phase of the emulsion (WO 00/15256)<br>
The vaccines of the present invention further comprise an antigen which may. or may not, be associated with the CpG-carrier complex, such as the CpG/tocol/oil droplet or the CpG/metal salt complex. The antigen may be free suspension or associated with a separate carrier. In a preferred aspect of the present invention the antigen is associated with the CpG/carrier complex.<br>
A preferred adjuvant combination according to the present invention is composed of one or more CpG oligonucleotides containing at least 3. preferably at least 6 nucleotides between two adjacent CG motifs, together with a tocol such as D, L cc-tocopherol. This combination preferably further comprises an adjuvant active derivative of LPS and a particulate carrier selected from the group comprising a metallic salt or an oil-in-water emulsion. Most preferably, the adjuvant combination comprises CpG 2006 (SEQ ID NO: 4), or CpG 1758 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or CpG 1826 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and a squalene/D, L a-tocopherol emulsion; this preferred adjuvant optionally further comprising 3-O-deacylated mono or diphosphoryl Iipid A and/or QS21. or both. A preferred adjuvant system comprises the combination of QS21, 3D-MPL and the tocol and CpG.<br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention may be used as both systemic ormucosal adjuvant. Vaccination of patients has been performed by many routes of administration, the most common of which is administration of the vaccine into the deep muscle of the individual (intramuscular injection). Other well known routes of vaccination include sub-cutaneous, intranasal, oral, rectal and intraperitoneal<br>
10<br><br>
and jntradermal administration. Although the vaccines of the present invention may be administered by any route, administration of the described vaccines into the skin Forms a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Human skin comprises an outer "horny" cuticle, called the stratum corneum. which overlays the epidermis. Underneath this epidermis is a layer called the dermis, which in turn overlays the subcutaneous tissue. Researchers have shown that injection of a vaccine into the skin, and in particular the dermis, stimulates an immune response, which may also be associated with a number of additional advantages. Intradermal vaccination with the vaccines described herein forms a preferred feature of the present invention.<br>
The conventional technique of intradermal injection, the "mantoux procedure*1, comprises steps of cleaning the skin, and then stretching with one hand, and with the bevel of a narrow gauge needle (26-31 gauge) facing upwards the needle is inserted at an angle of between 10-15°. Once the bevel of the needle is inserted, the barrel of the needle is lowered and further advanced whilst providing a slight pressure to elevate it under the skin. The liquid is then injected very slowly thereby forming a bleb or bump on the skin surface, followed by slow withdrawal of the needle.<br>
More recently, devices that are specifically designed to administer liquid agents into or across the skin have been described, for example the devices described in WO 99/34850 and EP 1092444, also the jet injection devices described for example in WO 01/13977; US 5.480,381, US 5,599,302, US 5,334,144, US 5,993,412, US 5,649,912, US 5,569,189, US 5,704,911, US 5,383,851, US 5,893,397, US 5,466,220, US 5,339,163, US 5,312,335, US 5,503,627, US 5,064,413, US 5,520, 639, US 4,596,556, US 4,790,824, US 4,941,880, US 4,940,460, WO 97/37705 and WO 97/13537. Alternative methods of intradermal administration of the vaccine preparations may include conventional syringes and needles, or devices designed for ballistic delivery of solid vaccines (WO 99/27961). or transdermal patches (WO 97/48440; WO 98/28037); or applied to the surface of the skin (transdermal or transcutaneous delivery WO 98/20734 ; WO 98/28037).<br>
When the vaccines of the present invention are to be administered to the skin, or more specifically into the dermis, the vaccine is in a low liquid volume, particularly a volume of between about 0.05 ml and 0,2 ml.<br>
1!<br><br>
As used herein, the term "intradermai delivery" means delivery of the vaccine to the region of the dermis in the skin. However, the vaccine will not necessarily be located exclusively in the dermis.  The dermis is the layer in the skin located between about 1.0 and about 2.0 mm from the surface in human skin, but there is a certain 5      amount of variation between individuals and in different parts of the body. In general. it can be expected to reach the dermis by going 1.5 mm below the surface of the skin. The dermis is located between the stratum corneum and the epidermis at the surface and the subcutaneous layer below.  Depending on the mode of delivery, the vaccine may ultimately be located solely or primarily within the dermis, or it may ultimately<br>
10      be distributed within the epidermis and the dermis.<br>
The development of suitable dosing and treatment regimens for using the particular compositions described herein in a variety of treatment regimens, including e.g., oral, parenteral, intravenous, intradermal, transdermal, intranasal. and intramuscular administration and formulation, is well known in the art. some of which<br>
15      are briefly discussed below for general purposes of illustration.<br>
In certain applications, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be delivered via oral administration to an animal. As such, these compositions may be formulated with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard- or soft-shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into 20      tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet.<br>
The active compounds may even be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tables, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like (see, for example, Mathiowitz et a!., Nature 1997 Mar 27;386(6623):410-4; Hwang et al., Crit RevTher Drug Carrier Syst 1998;15(3):243-<br>
25      84; U. S. Patent 5,641,515; U. S. Patent 5,580,579 and U. S. Patent 5,792,451). Tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain any of a variety of additional components, for example, a binder, such as gum tragacanth, acacia, cornstarch. or gelatin; excipients. such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent, such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant, such as<br>
30      magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent, such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent, such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.  Various other materials may be present<br>
12<br><br>
as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance. tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar, or both. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed.  In addition, the active compounds may be incorporated into sustained-release preparation and formulations. Typically, these formulations will contain at least about 0.1% of the active ingredients or more. although the percentage of the active ingredient(s) may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 1 or 2% and about 60% or 70% or more of the weight or volume of the total formulation. Naturally, the amount of active compound(s) in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life, as well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages and treatment regimens may be desirable.<br>
For oral administration the compositions of the present invention may alternatively be incorporated with ont or more excipients in the form of a mouthwash. dentifrice, buccal tablet, oral spray, or sublingual orally-administered formulation. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be incorporated into an oral solution such as one containing sodium borate. glycerin and potassium bicarbonate, or dispersed in a dentifrice, or added in a therapeutically-effective amount to a composition that may include water, binders, abrasives, flavoring agents, foaming agents, and humectants, Alternatively the compositions may be fashioned into a tablet or solution form that may be placed under the tongue or otherwise dissolved in the mouth.<br>
In certain circumstances it will be desirable to deliver the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally.  Such approaches are well known to the skilled artisan, some of which are further described, for example, in U. S. Patent 5,543,158; U. S. Patent 5.641,515 and U. S. Patent 5,399,363.  tn certain embodiments, solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose.  Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof<br>
13<br><br>
and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations generally will contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
Illustrative pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (for example, see U. S. Patent 5,466,468). In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol. and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be facilitated by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens. chlorobutanol. phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.  In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In one embodiment, for parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent First rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration.  In this connection, a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure.  For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion. (see for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580).  Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated.  Moreover, for human administration, preparations will of course preferably meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologies standards."<br>
14<br><br>
The carriers can further comprise any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art.  Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated.  Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. The phrase "pharmaceutically-acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human.<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions may be delivered by intranasa! sprays, inhalation, and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles.  Methods for delivering genes, nucleic acids, and peptide compositions directly to the lungs via nasal aerosol sprays has been described, e.g., in U. S. Patent 5,756.353 and U. S. Patent 5.804,212.  Likewise, the delivery of drugs using intranasal microparticle resins (Takenaga el al., J Controlled Release 1998 Mar 2;52(I-2):8t-7) and iysophosphatidyl-glycerol compounds (U. S. Patent 5,725.871) are also well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. Likewise, illustrative transmucosal drug delivery in the form of a polytetrafluoroetheylene support matrix is described in U. S. Patent 5,780,045.<br>
Methods of systemic administration of the vaccine preparations may include conventional syringes and needles, or devices designed for ballistic delivery of solid vaccines (WO 99/27961), or needleless pressure liquid jet device (US 4,596,556; US 5,993,412), or transdermal patches (WO 97/48440; WO 98/28037). The present invention may also be used to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens applied to the skin (transdermal or transcutaneous delivery WO 98/20734 ; WO 98/28037). The present invention therefore provides a delivery device for systemic administration, pre-filled with the vaccine or adjuvant compositions of the present invention.<br>

The present invention is exemplified, but not limited to, the following examples.<br>
Example 1, immunisation of mice with ECD-PD antigen<br>
This experiment was designed to investigate a range of adjuvant formulations with the antigen which is a fusion of the extracellular domain of Her2Neu linked to the phosphorylation domain (ECD-PD), which was produced in CHO cells according to the methods of WO 00/44899.<br><br>
The tocol containing oil in water emulsions used in the above groups used D, L, a-tocopherol (CAS No. 10191-41 -0; chemical name: (2RS/TRS, 8'RS)-2, 5, 7, 8-<br>
tetramethyl-2-(4', 8', 121-trimethyl-tridecyl)-6-chromanol)); which is commercially available from ROCHE™. If present the tocol was present in an oil in water emulsion comprising 2.5% by volume, in combination with squalene 2.5% by volume. Both oils were mixed, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80™) was added, prior to microfluidisation (Ml 10S microfluidics machine, maximum of 50 passes, for a period of 2 minutes at maximum pressure input of 6 bar (output pressure of about<br>
26<br><br>
850 bar) as described in WO 95/17210). Accordingly, groups 3,6, and 9 were based on the above tocol emulsion with the addition of aqueous QS21, 3D-MPL or CpG.<br>
QS21 and 3D-MPL if present in any ofthe vaccine groups above were included at 5u.g/dose; CpG (OLIGO 4 (SEQ ID NO:4): TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT) was added at 50µg dose.<br>
The adjuvants as used for group 2. 5. 10 were prepared according to techniques as described in EP 0 822 831 Bl (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Group 1 1 comprised 3D-MPL in the membrane of a liposome. Briefly, the 3D-MPL. dioleoyl phosphatydyl choline and cholesterol were mixed together and microfluidised into unilamellar liposomes (as described in EP 0 822 831 B1 - with the omission of QS21).<br>
The adjuvants used in groups 4, 7 and 8 were in aqueous suspension or solution. Vaccination procedure<br>
Groups of B6F1 mice were vaccinated on four occasions (in 50µl volumes). intramuscularly, 14 days apart. 14 days post the 4th vaccine dose, the mice were challenged subcutaneously with 2X106 TCI tumour cell expressing the Her2Neu.<br>
Tumour cell line TCI:<br>
Primary lung epithelial cells from C57BL.6 mice were immortalised by HPV<br>
16 E6 and E7 and then transformed with an activated ras oncogene, producing a tumourigenic cell line expressing E6 and E7 (Lin KY Cancer Res 1996 Jan l;56(l):21-6l).   The E7 expression has been verified by FACS analysis of fixed and perrneabilised TCI cells using the mouse anti-HPV 16 E7 Mab (Triton Corp, Alameda, CA). The Her2Neu-TCl tumour cell lines was produced by transduction of these TCI cells by retroviral vectors coding for Her2Neu. After a selection period with blastocydin, resistant clones were isolated and screened by FACS for Her2Neu expression. The clone with the highest Her2Neu expression was selected, and a challenge dose of 2X106 cells was identified to have a similar Kinetic of growth as the wild-type TCI cells and to give rise to a developing tumour in 100% ofthe control animals.<br>
The size ofthe individual tumors were measured twice a week and expressed as a group mean.<br>
27<br><br>
Results<br>
Figure 1 shows the tumour growth results for groups 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6." Figure 2 shows the tumour growth results for groups 1, 5, 6, 7 and 11. Figure 3 shows the tumour growth results for groups 1, 5, 6. 8, 9 and iO. Formulations comprising a tocol and CpG induced a complete regression of the tumor.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show the lymphoproliferation of splenocytes in vitro after incubation with the 5ug/ml of immunogen (ECD-PD) or extracellular domain (ECD) or intracellular domain (ICD) or Her2Neu.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the humoral immune response to the immunogen (ECD-PD) in terms of total Ig as measured by ELISA (FIG. 6) or IgG isotype distribution within these responses (FIG. 7).<br>
Example 2, Immunisation of mice with P703P antigen<br>
This experiment was designed to investigate a range of adjuvant formulations with the antigen which is a fusion of the antigen Prostase (Ferguson, et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 3114-3119)) and the N-terminal 1-81 fragment ofNSl from the Influenza virus (P703P-NS1).<br><br>
The tocol containing oil in water emulsions used in the above groups used D; L, a-tocopherol (CAS No. 10191-41-0; chemical name; (2RS,4;RS, 8"RS)-2. 5, 7, 8-tetramethyl-2-(4\ 8', 12-trimethyi-tridecyl)-6-chromanol)); which is commercially available from ROCHE™. If present the tocol was present in an oii in water emulsion comprising 2.5% by volume, in combination with squaiene 2.5% by volume. Both oils<br>
28<br><br>
were mixed, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80™) was added, prior to microfluidisation (Mll0S microfluidics machine, maximum of 50 passes, for" a period of 2 minutes at maximum pressure input of 6 bar (output pressure of about 850 bar) as described in WO 95/17210). Accordingly, groups 5 and 6 were based on the above tocol emulsion with the addition of aqueous QS21, 3D-MPL and/or CpG.<br>
QS21 and 3D-MPL if present in any of the vaccine groups above were included at 5ug/dose; CpG (OLIGO 4 (SEQ ID NO:4); TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT) was added at 50ug dose.<br>
The adjuvants as used for group 3 and 4 were prepared according to techniques as described in EP 0 822 83 1 Bl (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Vaccination procedure<br>
Groups of B6F1 mice were vaccinated on four occasions (in 50uI volumes), intramuscularly, 14 days apart.<br>
Results<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show the in vitro lymphoproliferation of splenocytes post second and 14 days post fourth vaccinations, after in vitro incubation with the 3u.g/ml of immunogen (NS1-P703P) or pichia expressed P703P (15jig/ml) or a non-specific NSl-OspA fusion protein.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show the humoral immune response to the immunogen (NS1-P703P) in terms of total Ig as measured by mid-point titre ELISA (FIG. 10) or IgG isotype distribution within these responses (FIG. 11).<br>
