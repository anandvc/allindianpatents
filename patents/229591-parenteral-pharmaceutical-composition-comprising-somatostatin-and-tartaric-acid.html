				<td>Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
The present invention relates to parenteral pharmaceutical compositions comprising a somatostatin analogue and to novel somatostatin analogues.<br>
Somatostatin Is a tetradecapeptide having the structure<br><br>
Since the isolation and characterization of somatostatin, an extensive search for more potent and more stable analogues has continued.<br>
Somatostatin analogues have been described e.g. In WO 97/01579. Said somatostatin: analogues comprise the amino acid sequence of formula I<br><br>
wherein Z1 is O or S, and<br>
X2 is an α-amino acid having an aromatic residue on the Cα side chain, or an amino acid unit selected from Dab, Dpr, Dpm, His,(Bzl)HyPro, thienyl-Ala, cyclohexyl-Ala and t-butyl-Ala, the residue Lys of said sequence corresponding to the residue Lys9 of the native somato-statin-14.<br>
By somatostatin analogue as used herein is meant a straight-chain or cyclic peptide derived from that of the naturally occurring somatostatin-14, comprising the sequence of formula I and wherein additionally one or more amino acid units have been omitted and/or replaced by<br><br>
one or more other amino add radical(s) and/or wherein one or more functional groups have been replaced by one or more other functional groups and/or one or more groups have been replaced by one or several other isosteric groups. In general the term covers all modified derivatives of the native somatostatin-14 comprising the above sequence of fomiula I which have binding affinity in the nM range to at least one somatostatin receptor subtype as defined hereinafter.<br>
Prefen'ed are somatostatin analogues in which the residues at positions 8 through 11 of the somatostatin-14 are represented by the sequence of formula I as defined above.<br>
More prefen'ed are sofnatostatin analogues as disclosed above comprising a hexapeptide unit, the residues at positions 3 through 6 of said hexapeptide unit comprising the sequence of formula L Even more preferably the residues at positions 1 and 2 of the hexapeptide unit of the somatostatin hexapeptide may be any of those as known in the art, e.g. as disclosed by A. S, Dutta in Small Peptides, Vol.19, 292-354, Elsevier, 1993. or as substituents for. Phe7 and/or Phe7 of somatostatin-14.<br>
Even more preferred are cyclic somatostatin hexapeptides, e.g. cyclic somatostatin hexapeptides comprising a hexapeptide unit numbered from 1 to 6. the residues at positions 3 through 6 of said hexapeptide unit having the amino sequence of formula I as indicated above, e.g. a compound of formula la<br><br>
wherein R3 is NR8R9-C2-6alky!ene, guanidino-C2-6alkylene or C2-6alkytene-COOH. R3a is H, Ci^alkyl or has independently one of the significances given for R3. Rsb is H or C2-4alkyl, Ra is OH or NR5R6, Rb is -(CH2)13- or -CH(CH3), R4 is H or CH3. R4as optionally ring-substituted<br><br><br>
These compounds in free form, salt form or protected form are referred to hereinafter as "compounds of the invention".<br>
Due to proteolytic degradation of the somatostatin analogues of the present invention, systemic delivery, e.g. parenteral administration, is highly desirable. However, parenteral<br><br>
administration may be very painful at tiie site of administration, especially in repeated administration.<br>
It has now been found that parenteral compositions comprising a compound of the invention, and tartaric acid show particularly interesting properties, e.g. good tolerabllity and high stability.<br>
A compound of the invention in protected form corresponds to a somatostatin analogue wherein at least one of the amino groups is protected and which by deprotection leads to a compound of formula II. preferably physiologically removable. Suitable amino protecting groups are e.g. as disclosed in "Protective Groups in Organic Syntiiesis", T. W. Greene, J. Wiley &amp; Sons NY (1981), 219-287, the contents of which being incorporated herein by reference. Example of such an amino protecting group is acet^.<br>
A compound of the invention may exist e.g. in free or salt fomn. Salts include acid addition salts witii e.g. inorganic acids, polymeric acids or organic acids, for example with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, aspartic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid or pamoic acid. Acid addition salts may exist as mono- or divalent salts, e.g. depending whether 1 or 2 acid equivalents are added. Preferred salts are the lactate, aspartate, benzoate, sucdnate and pamoate Including mono- and di-salts, more preferably the aspartate di-salt and the pamoate monosalt.<br>

The activity and characteristics of the compositions of the invention may be indicated in standard clinical or animal tests.<br>
Appropriate dosage of the composition of the invention will of course vary, e.g. depending on the condition to be treated (for example the disease type or the nature of resistance, the drug used, the effect desired and the mode of administration.<br>
When given continuously, an effective amount of drug may be given in two or three doses spread over time such as by parenteral administration, e.g. intravenous drip, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection(s), or subcutaneous infusion, e.g. continuous subcutaneous Infusion, preferably subcutaneous injection or infusion, with the total daily dose being spread across the portion or the entire administration period. When given by subcutaneous injection, it is most preferably administered from 3 times per week up to 3 times a day, preferably twice a week up to once or twice daily. A compound of the invention may also be administered in the form of e.g. a subcutaneous bolus injection.<br>
The composition of the invention preferably is suitable for subcutaneous administration.<br>
After injection, the composition of the invention is locally well tolerated. Particularly, the parenteral administration of a composition of the invention, e.g. subcutaneous injection, leads to mild to no burning sensation at the injection site.<br>
In addition to the good local tolerance after injection, the composition of the invention exhibits good stability characteristics. For example, less than 2.5% of degradation products were found after 4 weeks storage at 60'oC. For example, if stored with light protection at 2o'C to S^C, the compositions of the invention are stable over 24 montiis. Particularly good stability may be observed with the diaspartate salt of Compound A.<br>

A compound of fomiula III. e.g. Compound B, in protected form corresponds to above molecule wherein at least one of the amino groups is protected and which by deprotection leads to a compound of formula III, preferably physiologically removable. Suitable amino protecting groups are e.g. as disclosed in "Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis", T. W. Greene, J. Wiley &amp; Sons NY (1981), 219-287, the contents of which being incorporated herein by reference. Example of such an amino protecting group is acetyl.<br><br>
conveniently be a compound of formula III bearing a chelating group on the side chain amino group of Pro and complexed with a detectable or radiotherapeutic element. Compound B bearing a chelating group is referred to hereinto as conjugated Compound B,<br>
Examples of chelating groups include e.g. those derived from poly-aminopolycarboxylic acids or anhydrides, e.g. those derived from non cyclic ligands e.g. diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylene glycol-0,0'- bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EOTA), N,N'-bis(hydroxybenzyI)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED) and triethylene-<br><br><br>
The chelating group may be attached either directly or through a spacer to the side chain amino group of Pro. Suitable spacers include those known in the art, e.g. as disclosed in GB"A-2,225.579, for example the divalent residue of an amino-carboxylic acid, for example 3-Ala or a divalent residue derived from 6-amino-caprolc acid.<br>
Preferred chelating groups are those derived from DTPA, DOTA or TETA. Chelating groups derived from DTPA or DOTA are most preferred.<br>
By detectable element is meant any element, preferably a metal ion which exhibits a property detectable in vivo diagnostic techniques, e.g. a metal ion which emits a detectable radiation or a metal ion which is capable of influencing NMR relaxation properties. By radiotherapeutic element is meant any element which emits a radiation having a benefldal effect on the conditions to be treated.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula III, e.g. Compound B, may exist e.g. in free or salt form. Salts include acid addition salts with e.g. inorganic acids, polymeric acids or organic acids, for example with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, aspartic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid or pamoic acid. Acid addition salts may exist as mono- or divalent salts, e.g. depending whether 1 or 2 acid equivalents are added to the Compound B in free base form. Preferred salts are the lactate, aspartate, benzoate, succinate and pamoate including mono- and di-salts. more preferably the aspartate di-salt and the pamoate monosalt.<br>
The conjugated compounds of formula III, e.g. conjugated Compound B, may additionally exist in salt forms obtainable with the carboxyiic acid groups when present In the chelating group, e.g. alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium, or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts.<br>
The present invention also includes a process for the production of a compound of formula III, e.g. Compound B. It may be produced in analogy to known methods, for example:<br>
a)	cyclising a linear peptide in protected, polymer-bound or unprotected fonn in such a way that a compound of formula III, e.g. Compound B, is obtained and then optionally removing the protecting group(s),<br>
b)	to produce a conjugated compound of fomiula III. e.g. conjugated Compound B. linking together a chelating group and the compound of formula 111, e.g. Compound B, in protected or unprotected fonn and then optionally removing the protecting group,<br>
and recovering the compound of fomiula III, e.g. Compound B, or a conjugated compound of formula III, e.g. conjugated Compound B thus obtained, in free form, in salt form or optionally complexed with a detectable or radiotherapeutic element.<br>
It is generally not critical which amino acid is selected to be at the C-terminal position to start the peptide chain since the linear peptide will be cyclized, provided only that the sequence of amino acids in the linear peptide con-esponds to that in the desired compound of formula 111. e.g. Compound B. However there may be other factors which may preter one starting ammo acid over another. When a compound of formula III, e.g. Compound B, is prepared by solid phase synthesis, the first amino-acid is preferably attached to the resin, e.g. a commercially available polystyrene-based resin, through a suitable linker, e.g. a linker which is cleavable under mild conditions to keep the side chain protection intact, e.g. SASRIN or an optionally substituted trityl based linker, for example 4-(hydroxy-diphenyl-methyl)-benzoic acid wherein one the phenyl groups may optionally be substituted e.g. by CI. The building up of the desired peptide chain may be effected in conventlonnal manner, e.g. using amino-acid units<br><br><br><br><br>
residual amino groups which is monitored by a negative 'Kaiser* Ninhydrin test Before cleavage of the completely assembled protected linear peptide from its resin support the<br>
Na-Fmoc protection from the last residue is removed. -<br><br>
2 eq. DIPEA then 1.5 eq. of DPPA and stin-ed until completion (ca. 20h) at 0-4°C, The solvent was almost completely removed in vacuo; the concentrate is diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with NaHCO3, water, dried and evaporated in vacuo.<br>
For deprotection the residue Is dissolved at 0oC in TFA/H2O 95:5 (ca. 50 mM&gt; and stirred in the cold for 30 min. The product Is then precipitated with ether containing ca. 10 eq. HCI, filtered, washed with ether and dried. In order to .completely decompose remaining Indole-N carbaminic acid the product is dissolved in 5% AcOH and iyophilized after 15 h at ca. 5°C. Preparative RP-HPLC is carried out on a C-18 10μm STAGROMA column (5-25 cm) using a gradient of 0.5% TFA to 0.5% TFA in 70% acetonltrile. Fractions containing the pure titie compound are combined, diluted with water and Iyophilized. The lyophilisate is dissolved in water followed by precipitation with 10% Na2Cb3 in water. The solid free base is filtered of. washed with water and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The resulting white powder is directiy used for the different salts.<br><br><br>
Conversion to the mono- or di-aspartate is obtained by reacting 1 equivalent of the<br>
compound of Example 8 with  1  or 2 equivalent of asparlic acid in  a  mixture of<br>
acetonitrile/water 1:3. The resulting mixture is frozen and lyophilized.<br>
The di-aspartate may also be obtained by dissolving the compound of Example 8 In<br>
water/acetonitrile 4:1, filtering, loading on a an ion-exdiange resin, e.g. BioRad AG4X4<br>
column, and eluting with water/acetonitrile 4:1. The eluate is concentrated, frozen and<br>
lyophilized.<br>
c.     Benzoate<br>
Conversion to the benzoate may be obtained by dissolving the compound of Example 8 with 2 equivalents of benzoic add in a mixture of acetonitrile/water 1:2. The resulting mixture is frozen and lyophilized.<br>
d     Pamoate<br>
1 equivalent of the compound of Example 8 is dissolved together with 1 equivalent of<br>
embonic acid in a mixture of acetonitrile/THF/water 2:2:1. The resulting mixture is frozen and<br>
lyophilized.<br><br>
b)	400 mg commercially available DOTA x 2H2O (SYMAFEX - France) is dissolved in 20 ml<br>
water. After addition of 20 ml DMF, 170 mg cycIo[-Pro(4-OCO-NH-CH2-CHrNH2)-DPhg-<br>
DTrp-Lys(GBO}-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-], together with 190 mg DCCI and 60 mg N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide are added. The resulting suspension is kept at room temperature for 72<br>
hours. After filtration, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the remaining<br>
crude is purified on silica gel (DCM/MeOH/HOAc5o% 8/2/0.25 -&gt; 7/3/1 as mobile phase).<br>
c)	For deprotection the above DOTA - conjugate is treated with 5 ml trifluoroacetic<br>
acid/thioanisole (9/1) for two hours at room temperature. After that the solution is poured into<br>

Compounds of formula 111. e.g. Compound B, show GH-release inhibiting activity as indicated by flie inhibition of GH release in vitro from cultured pituitary cells. For example, anterior pituitary glands from adult male rats are cut into small pieces and dispersed using 0.1 % trypsin in 20 mM HEPES buffer. The dispersed cells are cultured for four days In MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum. 5% horse serum, 1 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 nM dexamethasone. 2.5 mg/ml insulin and 20 U/ml Pen/Strep. On the day of the experiment the attached cells are washed two times with Krebs-Rlnger medium buffered with 20 mM HEPES and supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.2 % BSA, Subsequently the cells are incubated for three hours with Compound B in the presence of 3x10-10 M growth homione releasing factor. The amount of growth hormone released into the medium is measured by RIA.<br>
Compounds of formula III, e.g. Compound B. inhibit the release of growth hormone (GH) in rats. Compound B is administered s.c. to anaesthetized rats. Blood is collected- after ' decapitation 1 h after administration of the compound. The duration of action Is estimated on the basis of the inhibition of basal GH secretion 6 h after drug treatment. Hormone levels are measured by RIA 1h and 6h after treatment. The IDso-value for the inhibition of the hormone secretion is determined graphically (log-probit) for each experiment and the resulting values are averaged logarithmically. In this in vivo model Compound B inhibits growth hormone release.<br>
