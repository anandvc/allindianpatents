				<td>The  present invention   relates  to  an  apparatus  for  scanning among a plurality of channels in a radio communication system.<br>
The present invention relates generally to a radio apparatus and, more particularly, to a channel scanning apparatus and method comprising the radio apparatus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Many radiotelephones are powered by a battery. Those battery powered radiotelephones that minimize power consumption and conserve battery power have a commercial advantage as they help extend the battery operating time.<br>
The radio communication system in which radiotelephones operate include a plurality of channels. The radiotelephone employs a receiver to repeatedly scan among the plurality of channels while the radiotelephone is not in service.  The receiver scans through the plurality of channels until it finds one containing service quality data. It is known to periodically power off the receiver during channel scanning to conserve battery power.  Known intermittent receiver operation schemes that save battery power during channel scanning are shown in the timing diagrams of FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a receiver that is initially powered on to perform a continuous scan of all the channels (23 through 43 and 323 through<br>
343) for a predetermined time period, such as 60 seconds. If no channel with service quality data is found during the 60 seconds, .the receiver goes into an intermittent scan mode to save battery power. During the intermittent scan mode the receiver is periodically powered on for a scanning period during which data on the strongest channels is examined. The receiver is powered off for a second predetermined time period, such as 9 seconds, between each scanning period. The intermittent scan mode is interrupted when the user actuates a key on a keypad of the radiotelephone or when service quality data is found on a channel during the scanning period.<br>
However, the scheme of FIG. 1 will only save battery power if no service quality data is found during the continuous scan and then only by powering off the receiver for the second predetermined time period during the intermittent scan mode. No battery power is saved during the continuous scan or during the scanning periods of the intermittent scan mode. Additionally, there is no opportunity for the radiotelephone to find service quality data when the receiver is powered off during the second predetermined time period.<br>
In FIG. 2, a receiver scans all of the channels (1 through 40) during a period T. One channel is scanned during each time period t1. The receiver is powered on for a first portion of t1 (denoted by a solid line) during which data on the channel is examined and powered off for a second portion of t1 (denoted by a dotted line). The receiver cycles through each channel until all of the channels are examined for service quality data. The scanning cycle is continued until a scanned channel is determined to contain service quality data.<br>
However, because the scheme of FIG. 2 must determine if service quality data is present at the time each channel is scanned, the scanning period T and partial scanning time t1 must be lengthy. Also, the scheme of FIG. 2 does not discern between weaker and stronger channels having service quality data, but instead selects the first channel with service quality data.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a channel scanning apparatus and method without lengthy continuous scanning periods, without lengthy<br>
periods where the receiver is powered off, and without service quality data check during the scanning of each channel.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an apparatus for scanning among a plurality of channels in a radio communication system, the apparatus being powered by a battery detachably coupled thereto, the apparatus comprising:<br>
receive circuitry for tuning to any one of the plurality of channels and measuring a reception strength of a tuned one of the plurality of channels; and<br>
control circuitry coupled to the receive circuitry to control the receive circuitry to scan through all of the plurality of channels one at a time, the control circuitry controlling the receive circuitry to periodically power off, wherein for each channel, the control circuitry stores a first measurement of the reception strength, powers off the receive circuitry, and stores a second measurement of the reception strength after the receive circuitry is powered back on.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A battery powered apparatus for scanning among a plurality of channels in a radio communication system includes receive circuitry and control circuitry.  The receive circuitry is tunable to any one of the plurality of channels and measures reception strength of the tuned channel.  The control circuitry controls the receive circuitry to scan through all of the plurality of channels one at a time. During the scan, the control circuitry stores a first reading of a measured reception strength of the tuned channel before powering off the receive circuitry. The control circuitry stores a second reading of a measured reception strength of the tuned channel after powering the receive circuitry back<br>
on. Unlike known scanning methods, reception strength readings are taken for each channel before powering off and after powering on the receive circuitry.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates radio communication system 300. Radio communication system 300 includes base station 302 and radio apparatus 304. Base station 302 provides service to radio apparatuses, such as radio apparatus 304, contained within a particular geographic area. Base station 302 communicates with these radio apparatuses via radio frequency (RF) signals, such as RF signals 303 communicated between base station 302 and radio apparatus 304. RF signals 303 are communicated on data and voice channels within a frequency band designated for use with radio communication system 300. In the illustrated embodiment, radio communication system 300 is an ETACS cellular radiotelephone system operating on frequency band 872 MHz to 905 MHz and 917 MHz to 950 MHz having data and voice channels. Data channels could be channels 23 through 43 and 323 through 343.<br>
Radio apparatus 304 includes antenna 308, duplexer 309, receive circuitry 310, control circuitry 312, user interface 314, and transmit circuitry 316. RF signals 303 detected by antenna 308 are input as electrical RF receive signals through duplexer 309 to receive circuitry 310. Receive circuitry 310 demodulates electrical RF receive signals into data signals and/or voice signals that are coupled to control circuitry 312. Control circuitry 312 delivers voice audio signals to a speaker (not shown) of user interface 314. Voice audio signals entered via a microphone (not shown) of user interface 314 are coupled through control circuitry 312 to transmit circuitry 316 as electrical audio signals. Transmit circuitry 316 modulates the electrical audio signals into electrical RF transmit signals and couples these signals to antenna 308 via duplexer 309. Antenna 308 emits the electrical RF transmit signals as RF signals 303.<br>
Radio apparatus 304 is powered by battery 305, which is detachably coupled thereto. Battery 305 includes electrochemical cells 306 for providing power. A positive terminal of electrochemical cells 306 is coupled to battery supply terminal (B+) 307 of radio apparatus 304. Battery supply terminal 307 supplies battery power to receive<br>
circuitry 310, control circuitry 312, user interface 314, and transmit circuitry 316. Battery 305 has a limited electrical life and provides power until it discharges to a voltage level that is insufficient to operate radio apparatus 304.<br>
Receive circuitry 310 includes receiver 320, receive frequency synthesizer 322, and RSSI (received signal strength indicator) generator 324. Receiver 320 is a double superheterodyne type that is well known in the art and, thus, will be described sparingly herein below. Receiver 320 is tuned by receive frequency synthesizer 322. Receive frequency synthesizer 322 applies a local oscillation signal to receiver 320 via signalling line 326. The local oscillation signal has an oscillation frequency that is associated with a channel in radio communication system 300. Application of the local oscillation signal locks receiver 320 to the channel. In the illustrated embodiment, the time required for receive frequency synthesizer to lock receiver 320 is approximately 3 ms. Once "locked", receiver 320 mixes the electrical RF receive signals input from duplexer 309 with the local oscillation signal to extract receive signals pertaining to the channel.<br>
After mixing, the receive signals are maintained in receiver 320 and routed to RSSI generator 324 coupled via reading line 328. Those receive signals maintained in receiver 320 are demodulated and coupled to control circuitry 312 as receive data signals on audio data line 327. Those routed to RSSI generator 324 via reading line 328 are measured by conventional circuitry, such as an envelope detector (not shown), which provides an analog DC voltage proportional to the strength of the receive signals to control circuitry 312 via line 329. The analog signal strength voltage indicates the reception strength of the present channel.<br>
Receive circuitry 310 includes receive switch circuit 330 coupled between battery supply terminal 307 and all of receiver 320, receive frequency synthesizer 322, and RSSI generator 324. Receive switch circuit 330 is controllable to connect battery power to, or disconnect battery power from, receiver 320, receive frequency synthesizer 322, and RSSI generator 324. Switch circuit 330 can be comprised of conventional circuitry, such as a transistor.<br><br>
Control circuitry 312 includes microprocessor 340, memory 342, timer 344, receive audio circuit 348, and transmit audio circuit 350. Microprocessor 340 can be any suitable microprocessor, such as a 68HC11 microprocessor commercially available from Motorola, Inc. Microprocessor 340 operates radio apparatus 304 by executing algorithms read from memory 342. Microprocessor 340 controls receive frequency synthesizer 322 to tune receiver 320 to a particular channel by sending a channel select signal thereto via channel select line 352. Microprocessor 340 controls receive switch circuit 330 to power on and power off receive circuitry 310 by sending a switch control signal via switch control line 354. Microprocessor 340 is coupled to RSSI generator 324 via line 329 and receives the signal strength voltage therefrom. Microprocessor 340 includes an analog-to-digital converter (not shown) that converts the analog DC voltage of the signal strength voltage into a digital number. The digital number is stored in memory 342.<br>
Memory 342 is coupled to RSSI generator 324 through microprocessor 340, which converts the analog signal strength voltage output from RSSI generator 324 to digital numbers suitable for storage in memory 342. Memory 342 can be a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), a random-access memory (RAM), another suitable memory device, or any combination of the aforementioned.  Although memory 342 is shown separate from microprocessor 340, it will be recognized that memory 342 could be internal to microprocessor 340 and/or that microprocessor 340 may contain other memory in addition to memory 342. In the illustrated embodiment, memory 342 stores the two largest signal strength voltage readings and their corresponding channel numbers in locations designated the "strongest" location and the "next strongest" location as determined by numerical compares performed by microprocessor 340 on the digital number representation of the analog signal strength voltage of all of the scanned channels. Memory 342 also stores multiple signal strength voltage readings of the present channel.<br>
Timer 344 is coupled to microprocessor 340 and includes one or more conventional timer circuits, such as a commercially available<br><br>
timer integrated circuit. Alternately, timer 344 may be a software timer generated within microprocessor 340 or a hardware timer disposed within microprocessor 340. Timer 344, under control of microprocessor 340, measures predetermined time periods for microprocessor 340.<br>
Receive audio circuit 348 is coupled to receiver 320, microprocessor 340, and user interface 314. Receive audio circuit 348 includes conventional circuitry for examining the quality of data of the receive data signals received from receiver 320 via audio data line 327. If the data of the receive data signals is of service quality, receive audio circuit 348 signals microprocessor 340.<br>
As stated, microprocessor 340 operates radio apparatus 304 by executing algorithms stored in memory 342. One such algorithm is a channel scanning algorithm. While not in service, radio apparatus 304 scans through all of the data channels in radio communication system 300. In order to save battery power during scanning, power to receive circuitry 310 is intermittently interrupted. FIGs. 4 and 5 illustrate a battery saving channel scanning method employed by radio apparatus 304. The battery saving channel scanning method is embodied in the channel scanning algorithm stored in memory 342 and executed by microprocessor 340.<br>
During channel scanning, transmit circuitry 316 is powered off to save battery power. Transmit circuitry 316 includes a transmit switch circuit (not shown), similar to receive switch circuit 330, which is controllable by microprocessor 340 to power off transmit circuitry 316.<br>
The operation of radio apparatus 304 will now be described with reference to FIGs. 3 through 5. The scanning method is initiated when receive circuitry 310 is powered on at to (block 500 of FIG. 5). Microprocessor 340 initiates a fast scan (block 502 of FIG. 5) for a time period TI. During TI the channels are scanned one at a time. As used herein, for each channel, scanning generally includes tuning receive circuitry 310 to a channel; reading the reception strength of the channel a first time; powering off receive circuitry 310; powering on receive circuitry 310; re-tuning receive circuitry 310 to the same channel; reading the reception strength of the channel a second time; tuning to a second channel, reading the reception strength of the second channel a<br><br>
first time; powering off receive circuitry 310; and continuing this process until the reception strength of each channel is read twice.<br>
The fast scanning method employed by radio apparatus 304 during T1, which comprises times to through t8, is as follows. At to, microprocessor 340 controls switch circuit 330 to power on receive circuitry 310. Between to and ti, microprocessor 340 tunes receiver 320. Microprocessor 340 programs the receive frequency synthesizer 322 by sending the channel select signal designating a first channel to receive frequency synthesizer 322. After receive frequency synthesizer 322 is programmed to the first channel, receiver 320 locks to the first channel. At t1, RSSI generator 324 takes a first signal strength voltage reading of the receive signals on the first channel. RSSI generator 324 couples the first reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Immediately after t1, microprocessor 340 controls switch circuit 330 to power off receive circuitry 310. In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between to and t1 is 5 ms.<br>
Between t1 and t2, receive circuitry 310 remains off. Receive circuitry 310 is kept off for a sufficient period of time so that in a multipath environment, statistically, the two consecutive signal strength voltage readings will not be taken within the same fade. A minimum recommended time period is 20 ms.  In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between t1 and t2 is 30 ms.<br>
At t2, microprocessor 340, responsive to a wakeup signal from timer 344, controls switch circuit 330 to power on receive circuitry 310. Between t2 and t3, receive circuitry 310 is re-tuned to the first channel. Re-tuning to the first channel can be accomplished by re-programming receive frequency synthesizer 322 to the first channel via microprocessor 340. Re-tuning can also be accomplished by merely allowing receiver 320 to re-lock, assuming that the programming of receive frequency synthesizer 322 to the first channel is maintained when receive circuitry 310 is powered off. Re-tuning without re-programming allows receiver 320 to lock faster. By t3, receiver 320 is locked to the first channel. At t3, RSSI generator 324 takes a second signal strength voltage reading of the receive signals on the first channel. RSSI generator 324 couples the second reading on the first<br>
channel to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Microprocessor 340 determines the largest reading of the first and second signal strength voltage readings and stores it, along with the first channel, in the "strongest" location of memory 342.  In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between t2 and t3 is 5 ms and the time period between to and t3, the period over which the first channel is fast scanned, is 40 ms. Therefore, receive circuitry 310 is only on for 10 ms out of the 40 ms period during which the first channel is read during fast scanning.<br>
At t3, microprocessor 340 tunes receive circuitry 310 to a second channel. Between 13 and 14, receiver 320 locks to the second channel. At t4, RSSI generator 324 takes a first signal strength voltage reading of the receive signals on the second channel. RSSI generator 324 couples the first reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Immediately after t4, microprocessor 340 controls switch circuit 330 to power off receive circuitry 310. At t5, microprocessor 340 powers on receive circuitry 310. Between ts and t6, receive circuitry 310 is re-tuned to the second channel. At t6, RSSI generator 324 takes a second signal strength voltage reading of the receive signals on the second channel. RSSI generator 324 couples the second reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Microprocessor 340 determines the largest one of the first and second signal strength voltage readings of the second channel. Microprocessor 340 compares the largest reading of the second channel to the previous readings stored in memory 342 in the "strongest" location or the "next strongest" location and, if necessary, stores the largest reading and channel number of the second channel in the "strongest" location or the "next strongest" location.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, fast scanning continues in this manner until the signal strength voltage of each channel is read twice, with the receiver off between the two readings of each channel. The fast scanning process concludes at t8, after RSSI generator 324 takes a second signal strength voltage reading of the signals on the last channel and couples the second reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Microprocessor 340 determines the largest of the signal strength voltage readings of the last channel, compares the largest reading to the readings stored in the "strongest" and "next strongest" locations of<br>
memory 342, and stores the largest reading in the "strongest" or "next strongest" location, if necessary.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, T1 is only approximately 840 ms. At no time during T1 does control circuitry 312 determine if service quality data is present on the scanned channels.  This minimizes TI. Receive circuitry 310 is off for 30 of the 40 ms during the fast scan of T1 or off for approximately 75% of T1. This minimizes battery power consumption.<br>
At the conclusion of T1, microprocessor 340 examines the channels with the two strongest signal strength voltages for data (block 504 of FIG. 5) for a time period T2- The channels with the two strongest signal strength voltages were determined by microprocessor 340 and stored in the "strongest" and "next strongest" locations of memory 342 during the fast scan of T1. During T2, microprocessor 340 keeps receive circuitry 310 powered on. T2 comprises times t9 through t10. At time t9, microprocessor 340 reads the channel from the "strongest" location of memory 342 and tunes receive circuitry 310 thereto. Between t8 and t9, microprocessor 340 remains responsive to receive audio circuit 348, which examines the receive data signal for service quality data (block 506 of FIG. 5). If service quality data is found, microprocessor 340 keeps receiver 320 tuned to this channel, places radio apparatus 304 in service (block 508 of FIG. 5), and ends scanning (block 510 of FIG. 5). In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between tg and t9 is approximately 120 ms.<br>
If service quality data is not found on the channel stored in the "strongest" location of memory 342, microprocessor 340 reads the channel from the "next strongest" location of memory 342 and tunes receiver 320 thereto at time t9. Between t9 and t10, microprocessor 340 remains responsive to receive audio circuit 348, which examines the receive data signal for service quality data (block 506 of FIG. 5). If service quality data is found, microprocessor 340 keeps receiver 320 tuned to this channel, places radio apparatus 304 in service (block 508 of FIG. 5), and ends scanning (block 510 of FIG. 5). In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between t9 and t10 is approximately 120 ms.<br>
If service quality data is not found on either of the channels stored in the "strongest" and "next strongest" locations of memory 342, microprocessor 340 determines if more than a predetermined number of consecutive fast scans has occurred (block 512 of FIG. 5). If more than the predetermined number of consecutive fast scans has not occurred, another fast scan is performed (block 502 of FIG. 5). If more than the predetermined number of consecutive fast scans has occurred, the predetermined number in the illustrated embodiment being four, the scanning method executes a slow scan (block 514 of FIG. 5) at time t10-<br>
The slow scan occurs over a time period T3. During T3 all of the control channels are scanned one at a time. The events of the slow scan are similar to those of the fast scan of period T1. For example, at t10, microprocessor 340 powers on receive circuitry 310 and tunes receive circuitry 310 to the first control channel. Between t10 and tn, receiver 320 locks to the first channel. At tn, RSSI generator 324 takes a first signal strength voltage reading on the first channel and couples the first reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. Immediately after t1, microprocessor 340 powers off receive circuitry 310. In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between 10o and tn is equal to the time period between to and t1 of the fast scan, 5 ms.<br>
However, the slow scan differs from the fast scan in the amount of time that receive circuitry 310 remains off. The period between tn and t12, wherein receive circuitry 310 is off, is preferably 110 ms.<br>
The events at t12 and t13 of the slow scan are similar to those of t2 and t3 of the fast scan. For example, at t12, microprocessor 340 powers on receive circuitry 310. Between t12 and t12, receiver 320 again locks to the first channel. At t13, RSSI generator 324 takes a second signal strength voltage reading on the first channel and couples the second reading to memory 342 via microprocessor 340. In the illustrated embodiment, the time period between t12 and t13 is similar to the time period between t2 and t3, that is 5 ms. The time period between t10 and t13 over which the first channel is slow scanned, is preferably 120 ms. Therefore, receive circuitry 310 is only on for 10 ms out of the 120 ms period over which the first channel is slow scanned.<br>
Slow scanning continues in the aforementioned manner until all of the remaining data channels are scanned and period T3 expires. Although T3 is substantially longer in duration than T1, receive circuitry 310 is off for approximately 92% of T3, thereby, minimizing battery power consumption.<br>
At the expiration of T3 and the completion of slow scan, microprocessor 340 proceeds to examine the channels with the two strongest signal strength voltages as determined during the slow scan (block 504 of FIG. 5). The two strongest channels of the slow scan are examined in the same manner previously discussed in relation to the fast scan (blocks 506 through 512 of FIG. 5).<br>
Although radio apparatus 304 is illustrated as a cellular radiotelephone, the present invention will also find application in radios, televisions, cordless telephones, two-way radios, pagers, personal digital assistants, and the like, and "apparatus" as used herein shall refer to all such battery powered electronic devices and their equivalents.<br>
Thus it can be seen that a scanning apparatus and a scanning method are disclosed that save battery power. Unlike prior art scanning methods, battery power conservation begins immediately after the receive circuitry is powered on. Lengthy periods where the receiver is powered off are avoided in order to increase the opportunity for the radiotelephone to find service quality data. Also, by performing data checks on only a limited number of channels (i.e., those that are most likely to have service quality data), receiver on time is reduced and greater battery savings are realized.<br><br><br><br>

plurality  of  channels   for  a  first predetermined period of time during which the radio continually remains out of service, the step of scanning, for each <br>
channel of the plurality of channels, including the sub-steps of:<br>
powering off the receiver 310,320 by receive switch circuit (330) controlled by <br>
microporecssor 340  between  taking first and second reception <br><br>
strength measurements, and selecting a strongest one of the first and second reception strength measurements to be indicative of reception strength by the microprocessor (340) ; examining 340 for a second predetermined period of time and after the first predetermined period of time has elapsed, data on a predetermined number of channels of the plurality of channels having strong ones of the reception; and scanning (340) when the data on the predetermined number of channels is not of service quality, each channel of the plurality of channels for a third predetermined period of time during which the radio continually remains out of service, the third predetermined period of time greater than the first predetermined period of time.<br>
7.       A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein<br>
the sub-step of selecting has the substep of selecting a strongest one of the first and second reception strength measurements to be indicative of reception strength, and<br>
the first step of scanning has the substep of storing, following the substep of selecting, the reception strength.<br>
8.       A method according to claim 6, wherein<br>
the step of powering off the receiver (3220) between taking measurements further comprises the substep of powering off the receiver (320) for a fourth predetermined period of time, and<br>
the step of scanning further comprises the substep of powering on the receiver  (320) to take the first and second reception strength measurements for a fifth predetermined period of time, the fifth predetermined period of time less than the fourth period of time.<br>
9.       A method as claimed in claim   6  wherein the second step of scanning,<br>
for each channel of the plurality of channels, has the substeps of;<br><br>
powering on the receiver (320) by switch circuit (330)  for a sixth predetermined period of time to<br><br>
take first and second reception strength measurements, the sixth predetermined period of time substantially equal to the fifth predetermined period of time, and<br>
powering of the receiver  320 for a seventh predetermined period of time<br>
between taking the first and second reception strength measurements,<br>
the seventh predetermined period of time greater than the fourth and sixth predetermined periods of time.<br>
10.     A method as claimed in claim 6 having the steps of:<br><br>
tuning the receiver  (320) to a next channel of the plurality of channels; and<br>
reading reception strength of the next channel of the plurality of channels.<br></td>
