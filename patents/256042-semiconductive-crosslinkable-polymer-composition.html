				<td>Semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition<br>
The present invention relates to crosslinkable polymer compositions which<br>
are useful for the preparation of semiconductive layers of electric cables.<br>
Electric cables, in particular electric power cables for medium and high<br>
voltages, are made of a plurality of polymer layers extruded around the<br>
electric conductor. The electric conductor is usually coated first with an<br>
inner semiconducting layer, followed by an insulating layer, then an outer<br>
semiconducting layer. To these layers, further layers may be added, such as<br>
water-barrier layer and a sheath layer.<br>
Normally, the insulating layer and the semiconducting layer are made of<br>
ethylene homo- and/or copolymers which are preferably crosslinked.<br>
Nowadays, low density polyethylene, crosslinked by adding peroxide com-<br>
pounds, is the predominant cable-insulating material. The inner semi-<br>
conducting layer normally comprises an ethylene copolymer, such as an<br>
ethylene-ethylacrylate copolymer or an ethylene-butylacrylate copolymer.<br>
Outer semiconducting layers can be strippable or non-strippable. Normally,<br>
a strippable semiconducting layer comprises an ethylene copolymer in<br>
combination with an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and sufficient carbon<br>
black to make the composition semiconducting. A non-strippable outer<br>
semiconducting layer may comprise an ethylene-butylacrylate copolymer<br>
together with an amount of carbon black sufficient to make the composition<br>
semiconducting.<br>
The amount of carbon black added to make the polymeric material semi-<br>
conductive does not only affect electrical properties but also a number of<br>
other properties like compounding behavior relavant for the manufacturing<br>
of the semiconductive material and extrusion behavior as well as formation<br>
of scorch of the final product.<br><br>
-2-<br>
For compounding, the surface area of carbon black particles has to be wet-<br>
ted by the polymeric melt to result in a homogeneous blend. However,<br>
since carbon black particles usually have a large specific surface area, even<br>
a small reduction in carbon black content facilitates the compounding in<br>
terms of compounding rate and consistency (i.e. obtaining consistently a<br>
good quality).<br>
There is also a relationship between the amount of carbon black and the<br>
rheological properties of the resultant polymeric material. As a general<br>
rule, viscosity at a given shear rate increases with increasing carbon black<br>
content. Furthermore, increasing viscosity with decreasing shear rate/shear<br>
stress is typical for polymers having a high content of filler particles. In<br>
dies of complex geometry, there may exist regions of low shear forces.<br>
Thus, in these regions, the viscosity is very high and, if exceeding a certain<br>
limit, the melt does not pass these regions at a sufficiently high rate. As<br>
explained above, insulating and semi-conductive layers are preferably made<br>
of crosslinked polyethylene, wherein crosslinking is initiated in a vulcaniz-<br>
ing tube by crosslinking agents such as peroxides. However, if a significant<br>
amount of peroxide already decomposes in the extruder, thereby initiating<br>
premature crosslinking, this will result in so-called "scorch", i.e. formation<br>
of inhomogeneity, gel-like areas, surface-unevenness of the extruded poly-<br>
mer etc. To suppress the formation of scorch as much as possible, it is de-<br>
sired to minimize residence time of the polymeric melt including the perox-<br>
ide within the above mentioned regions of low shear forces. Again, with<br>
regard to reduction of scorch, less carbon black would be favored.<br>
In EP-A-0929606, the formation of scorch was reduced by blending a si-<br>
lane-containing polyethylene with carbon black having a surface area of<br>
30-80 m2/g.<br><br>
-3-<br>
In EP-A-1125306, the amount of carbon black was reduced by providing a<br>
specific non-uniform ethylene-alkyl(meth)acrylate.<br>
On the other hand, for providing semiconductive cable layers, the amount<br>
of carbon black must be sufficiently high. Thus, simply reducing the carbon<br>
black content of existing polymer compositions might improve compound-<br>
ing and extrusion behavior but inevitably results in material of high volume<br>
resistivity which is not appropriate for semiconductive polymers to be used<br>
in power cables.<br>
To improve resistance to thermal and mechanical stress, polymers extruded<br>
onto a cable conductor are preferably crosslinked. For crosslinking, the ca-<br>
ble is passed through a vulcanization tube, where the cable is heated to ac-<br>
tivate the crosslinking agent, e.g. peroxides, and initiate crosslinking. To<br>
increase production rate, the cable is preferably passed through the vul-<br>
canization tube at high line speed. However, at high line speed, the degree<br>
of crosslinking might be too low for sufficiently improving thermal and<br>
mechanical properties. Thus, to improve production rate, it is desired to<br>
have a high crosslinking efficiency, i.e. a high degree of crosslinking ob-<br>
tained within a short period of time. However, any increase of crosslinking<br>
efficiency (e.g. by increasing the peroxide content) should not be at the ex-<br>
pense of other relevant properties such as compounding, scorch behavior<br>
and volume resistivity.<br>
Furthermore, as explained above, if a significant amount of peroxide al-<br>
ready decomposes in the extruder, this will result in so-called scorch.<br>
Therefore, to suppress the formation of scorch as much as possible, the<br>
amount of peroxide needed to sufficiently crosslink the semiconductive ma-<br>
terial is preferably reduced. However, with too low amounts of peroxide,<br>
the degree of crosslinking might be too low for sufficiently improving<br>
thermal and mechanical properties. Thus, to improve extrusion behaviour in<br><br>
-4-<br>
terms of scorch formation, it is desired to have a high crosslinking effi-<br>
ciency, i.e. a high degree of crosslinking obtained with a low amount of<br>
peroxide. Optimally, no peroxide is present within the semiconductive ma-<br>
terial during the extrusion step. However, any decrease of crosslinking<br>
agent should not be at the expense of other relevant properties such as<br>
compounding behavior, cable production rate and volume resistivity.<br>
Considering the problems mentioned above, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a semiconductive polymer composition wherein the<br>
amount of carbon black and/or the amount of peroxide can be reduced<br>
without adversely affecting semi-conducting properties. Furthermore, there<br>
should be a good balance between crosslinking efficiency, suppression of<br>
scorch and reduction of volume resistivity.<br>
This object is solved by providing a semi-conductive crosslinkable polymer<br>
composition comprising<br>
(a)	an unsaturated polyolefm having at least 0.15 vinyl groups/1000 car-<br>
bon atoms, and<br>
(b)	carbon black.<br>
The content of unsaturation, generated by incorporating vinyl groups within<br>
the polyolefm component, enables to accomplish improved crosslinking<br>
properties. In a preferred embodiment, the number of vinyl groups is at<br>
least 0.20/1000 carbon atoms. In other preferred embodiments, it is at least<br>
0.25, at least 0.30, at least 0.35, at least 0.40, at least 0.45, at least 0.55 or<br>
at least 0.60 vinyl groups/1000 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, it might be preferred to keep the number of vinyl<br>
groups within a certain range to improve balance between properties like<br>
crosslinking efficiency, scorch and electrical conductivity. Preferably, the<br><br>
-5-<br>
number of vinyl groups is from 0.35 to 3, even more preferably from 0.40<br>
to 1/1000 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred unsaturated polyolefins of the present invention may have densi-<br>
ties higher than 0.860, 0.880, 0.900, 0.910, 0.915, 0.917, or 0.920 g/cm3.<br>
The polyolefin can be unimodal or multimodal, e.g. bimodal.<br>
Preferably, the unsaturated polyolefin has a melt flow rate MFR2.16/190°c of<br>
0.1 to 50 g/10 min, more preferably 0.3 to 20 g/10 min, even more prefera-<br>
bly 1.0 to 15 g/10 min, and most preferably 2.0 to 10 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably, the unsaturated polyolefin is prepared by copolymerising at<br>
least one olefin monomer with at least one polyunsaturated comonomer. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the polyunsaturated comonomer consists of a<br>
straight carbon chain with at least 8 carbon atoms and at least 4 carbon at-<br>
oms between the non-conjugated double bonds, of which at least one is<br>
terminal.<br>
Ethylene and propylene are preferred olefin monomers. Most preferably,<br>
ethylene is used as the olefin monomer. As a comonomer, a diene com-<br>
pound is preferred, e.g. 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, 1,11-dodecadiene,<br>
1,13-tetradecadiene, or mixtures thereof. Furthermore, dienes like 7-<br>
methyl-l,6-octadiene, 9-methyl-l,8-decadiene, or mixtures thereof can be<br>
mentioned. Unsaturated polyethylene of low density is preferred, e.g. un-<br>
saturated polyethylene having a density within the range of 0.915 to 0.939<br>
g/cm3. In a preferred embodiment, the unsaturated polyethylene contains at<br>
least 50 wt-% ethylene monomer units. In other preferred embodiments, the<br>
unsaturated polyethylene contains at least 60 wt-%, at least 70 wt-%, at<br>
least 80 wt-% or at least 85 wt-% ethylene monomer units.<br><br>
-6-<br>
If the unsaturated polyolefin is an unsaturated polyethylene, its melt flow<br>
rate MFR2.16/190oc is preferably 0.1 to 50 g/10 min, more preferably 0.3 to<br>
20 g/10 min, even more preferably 1.0 to 15 g/10 min.<br>
Siloxanes having the following formula:<br>
CH2=CH-[Si(CH3)2-0]n-Si(CH3)2-CH=CH2, wherein n=l or higher<br>
can also be used as a polyunsaturated comonomer. As an example, divinyl-<br>
siloxanes, e.g. α,ω-divinylsiloxane, can be mentioned.<br>
In addition to the polyunsaturated comonomer, further comonomers can<br>
optionally be used. Such optional comonomers are selected from C3-C2o<br>
alpha-olefins such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-nonene, polar<br>
comonomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylates, methacry-<br>
lates or acetates.<br>
As an example, the crosslinkable polymer composition may contain polar<br>
comonomer units, such as 1-50 wt.-%, 3-25 wt.-% and 5-20 wt.-% polar<br>
comonomer units per gram of unsaturated polyolefin.<br>
Still more preferably, the polar unsaturated polyolefin comprises a copoly-<br>
mer of ethylene with C1 to C4 acrylates, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl<br>
acrylates or vinyl acetates.<br>
The unsaturated polyolefin can be produced by any conventional polymeri-<br>
sation process. Preferably, it is produced by radical polymerisation, such as<br>
high pressure radical polymerisation. High pressure polymerisation can be<br>
effected in a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Preferably, it is a tubu-<br>
lar reactor. In general, the pressure can be within the range of 1200-3500<br>
bars and the temperature can be within the range of 150°C-350°C. Further<br>
details about high pressure radical polymerisation are given in<br>
WO93/08222, which is herewith incorporated by reference. However, the<br><br>
-7-<br>
unsaturated polyolefm can also be prepared by other types of polymerisa-<br>
tion, such as coordination polymerisation, e.g. in a low pressure process,<br>
with Ziegler-Natta, chromium, single site/dual site, metallocene (for exam-<br>
ple transition metal catalysts), non-metallocenes (for example late transi-<br>
tion metals). The transition and late transition metal compounds are found<br>
in groups 3-10 in the periodic table (IUPAC 1989). These catalysts can be<br>
used in the supported and non-supported mode, i.e. with and without car-<br>
rier.<br>
According to the present invention, the semiconductive crosslinkable<br>
polymer composition further comprises carbon black.<br>
The semiconductive properties result from the carbon black added to the<br>
unsaturated polyolefm. Thus, the amount of carbon black is at least such<br>
that a semiconducting composition is obtained. Depending on the desired<br>
use and conductivity of the composition, the amount of carbon black can<br>
vary. Preferably, the crosslinking polymer composition comprises 15-50<br>
wt% carbon black, based on the weight of the semiconductive crosslinkable<br>
composition. In other preferred embodiments, the amount of carbon black<br>
is 10-45 wt.-%, 20-45 wt%, 30-45 wt%, 35-45 wt% or 36-41 wt%, based on<br>
the weight of the semiconductive crosslinkable composition.<br>
Any carbon black can be used which is electrically conductive. Examples<br>
of suitable carbon blacks include furnace blacks and acetylene blacks.<br>
Suitable furnace blacks may have a primary particle size less than 29nm<br>
measured according to A.STM D-3849. Many suitable furnace blacks of this<br>
category are characterized by an iodine number between 60 and 300mg/g<br>
according to ASTM D-1510 and an oil absorption number between 50 and<br>
200 ml/lOOg.<br><br>
o<br>
- o -<br>
Suitable furnace blacks may have a primary particle size of greater than<br>
28nm measured according to ASTM D-3849. Many suitable furnace blacks<br>
of this category are characterized by an iodine number between 30 and<br>
200mg/g according to ASTM D-1510 and an oil absorption number be-<br>
tween 80 and 300 ml/100g.<br>
Other suitable carbon blacks can be made by any other process or be fur-<br>
ther treated.<br>
Suitable carbon blacks for semiconductive cable layers are preferably char-<br>
acterized by their cleanliness. Therefore, preferred carbon blacks have an<br>
ash-content of less than 0.2 wt-% measured according to ASTM-1506, a<br>
325 mesh sieve residue of less than 30ppm according to ASTM D-1514 and<br>
have less than 1 wt-% total sulphur according to ASTM-1619.<br>
Most preferred are extra-clean carbon blacks having an ash-content of less<br>
than 0.05 wt-% measured according to ASTM-1506, a 325 mesh sieve resi-<br>
due of less than 15ppm according to ASTM D-1514 and have less than 0.05<br>
wt-% total sulphur according to ASTM-1619.<br>
Preferably, the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition has a<br>
volume resistivity, measured at 90°C, of less than 500000 Ohm • cm, more<br>
preferably less than 100000 Ohm • cm, even more preferably less than<br>
50000 Ohm • cm. Volume resistivity is in a reciprocal relationship to elec-<br>
trical conductivity, i.e. the lower resistivity, the higher is conductivity.<br>
As discussed above, an unsaturated polyolefin having at least 0.15 vinyl<br>
groups/1000 carbon atoms and carbon black are essential components of<br>
the semiconductive crosslinkable composition of the present invention. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the crosslinkable semiconductive polymer composi-<br>
tion comprises (a) an unsaturated polyolefin having 0.35 to 3.0, even more<br>
preferably 0.40 to 1.0 vinyl groups/1000 carbon atoms, prepared by polym-<br><br>
-9-<br>
erizing ethylene with a diene comonomer, optionally in the presence of a<br>
further comonomer like propylene and (b) 30 to 45 wt%, even more pref-<br>
erably 36 to 41 wt% carbon black, based on the weight of the crosslinkable<br>
semiconductive polymer composition.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the semiconductive crosslinkable<br>
polymer composition further comprises a crosslinking agent.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a crosslinking agent is defined to be<br>
any compound which can initiate radical polymerisation. A crosslinking<br>
agent can be a compound capable of generating radicals when decomposed<br>
but also comprises the radicals obtained after decomposition. Preferably,<br>
the crosslinking agent contains at least one -O-O- bond or at least one -<br>
N=N- bond. More preferably, the cross-linking agent is a peroxide and/or a<br>
radical obtained therefrom after thermal decomposition.<br>
The cross-linking agent, e.g. a peroxide, is preferably added in an amount<br>
of less than 3.0 wt.-%, more preferably 0.2-2.6 wt.-%, even more prefera-<br>
bly 0.3-2.2 wt.-%, based on the weight of the crosslinkable polymer com-<br>
position. To have a good balance between scorch and crosslinking effi-<br>
ciency, it might be preferred to add the crosslinking agent, in particular a<br>
peroxide, in an amount of 0.3 to 1.0 wt%, even more preferably 0.4 to 0.8<br>
wt%, based on the weight of the semiconductive crosslinkable composition.<br>
The cross-linking agent may be added to the semiconductive crosslinkable<br>
composition during the compounding step (i.e. when the unstaturated poly-<br>
olefm is mixed with the carbon black), or after the compounding step in a<br>
separate process, or during the semiconductive crosslinkable composition is<br>
extruded, or after the extrusion, e.g. by diffusion of cross-linking radicals<br>
from another cable layer into the semiconductive layer.<br><br>
-10-<br>
As peroxides used for crosslinking, the following compounds can be men-<br>
tioned: di-tert-amylperoxide, 2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-<br>
hexyne, 2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, tert-butylcumylper-<br>
oxide, di(tert-butyl)peroxide, dicumylperoxide, di(tert-butylperoxy-<br>
isopropyl)benzene, butyl-4,4-bis(tert-butylperoxy)valerate, 1, l-bis(tert-<br>
butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-butylperoxybenzoate, diben-<br>
zoylperoxide.<br>
Preferably, the peroxide is selected from 2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-<br>
dimethyl-hexane, di(tert-butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene, dicumylperoxide,<br>
tert-butylcumylperoxide, di(tert-butyl)peroxide, or mixtures thereof. Most<br>
preferably, the peroxide is di(tert-butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene.<br>
The semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition may comprise fur-<br>
ther additives. As possible additives, antioxidants, scorch retarders,<br>
crosslinking boosters, stabilisers, processing aids, flame retardant addi-<br>
tives, acid scavengers, inorganic fillers, voltage stabilizers, additives for<br>
improving water tree resistance, or mixtures thereof can be mentioned.<br>
A "scorch retarder" is defined to be a compound that reduces the formation<br>
of scorch during extrusion of a polymer composition if compared to the<br>
same polymer composition extruded without said compound. Besides<br>
scorch retarding properties, the scorch retarder may simultaneously result<br>
in further effects like boosting, i.e. enhancing crosslinking performance.<br>
Useful scorch retarders can be selected from 2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-l-pentene,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted diphenylethylene, quinone derivatives, hydro-<br>
quinone derivatives, monofunctional vinyl containing esters and ethers, or<br>
mixtures thereof. More preferably, the scorch retarder is selected from 2,4-<br>
diphenyl-4-methyl-l-pentene, substituted or unsubstituted diphenylethyl-<br>
ene, or mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the scorch retarder is 2,4-<br>
diphenyl-4-methyl-1 -pentene.<br><br>
-11-<br>
Preferably, the amount of scorch retarder is within the range of 0.005 to 1.0<br>
wt.-%, more preferably within the range of 0.01 to 0.8 wt-%, based on the<br>
weight of the crosslinkable polyolefm composition. Further preferred<br>
ranges are 0.03 to 0.75 wt-%, 0.05 to 0.70 wt-% and 0.10 to 0.50 wt-%,<br>
based on the weight of the crosslinkable polyolefm composition.<br>
Typical cross-linking boosters may include compounds having an allyl<br>
group, e.g. triallylcyanurate, triallylisocyanurate, and di-, tri- or tetra-<br>
acrylates.<br>
As antioxidant, sterically hindered or semi-hindered phenols, aromatic<br>
amines, aliphatic sterically hindered amines, organic phosphates, thio com-<br>
pounds, polymerized 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline and mixtures<br>
thereof, can be mentioned.<br>
Preferably, the antioxidant is selected from the group of diphenyl amines<br>
and diphenyl sulfides. The phenyl substituents of these compounds may be<br>
substituted with further groups such as alkyl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl or hy-<br>
droxy groups.<br>
Preferably, the phenyl groups of diphenyl amines and diphenyl sulfides are<br>
substituted with tert.-butyl groups, preferably in meta or para position,<br>
which may bear further substituents such as phenyl groups.<br>
More preferred, the antioxidant is selected from the group of 4,4'-<br>
bis(l,rdimethylbenzyl)diphenylamine, para-oriented styrenated diphenyl-<br>
amines, 6,6'-di-tert.-butyl-2,2'-thiodi-p-cresol, tris(2-tert.-butyl-4-thio-(2'-<br>
methyl-4'hydroxy-5'-tert.-butyl)phenyl-5-methyl)phenylphosphite, polym-<br>
erized 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline, or derivatives thereof.<br>
Of course, not only one of the above-described antioxidants may be used<br>
but also any mixture thereof.<br><br>
-12-<br>
If an antioxidant, optionally a mixture of two or more antioxidants, is used,<br>
the added amount can range from 0.005 to 2.5 wt-%, based on the weight of<br>
the unsaturated polyolefm. If the unsaturated polyolefm is an unsaturated<br>
polyethylene, the antioxidant(s) are preferably added in an amount of 0.005<br>
to 1.0 wt-%, more preferably 0.01 to 0.80 wt-%, even more preferably 0.05<br>
to 0.60 wt-%, based on the weight of the unsaturated polyethylene. If the<br>
unsaturated polyolefm is an unsaturated polypropylene, the antioxidant(s)<br>
are preferably added in an amount of 0.005 to 2 wt-%, more preferably 0.01<br>
to 1 wt-%, even more preferably 0.05 to 0.5 wt-%, based on the weight of<br>
the unsaturated polypropylene.<br>
Further additives may be present in an amount of 0.005 to 3 wt%, more<br>
preferably 0.005 to 2 wt%. Flame retardant additives and inorganic fillers<br>
can be added in higher amounts.<br>
From the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition comprising at<br>
least one of the crosslinking agents as defined above, preferably a peroxide,<br>
a semiconductive crosslinked polymer composition can be prepared by<br>
treatment under crosslinking conditions, e.g. by heat treatment.<br>
Preferably, the semiconductive crosslinked polymer composition has a vol-<br>
ume resistivity, measured at 90°C, of less than 500000 Ohm • cm, more<br>
preferably less than 100000 Ohm • cm, even more preferably less than<br>
50000 Ohm • cm.<br>
Furthermore, the semiconductive crosslinked polymer composition prefera-<br>
bly has a hot set value, measured according to IEC 811-2-1, of less than<br>
300 %&gt;, more preferably less than 200 %, and even more preferably less<br>
than 100 %. Hot set values are related to the degree of crosslinking. The<br>
lower a hot set value, the higher is the degree of crosslinking.<br><br>
-13-<br>
From the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition of the present<br>
invention, a multi-layered article can be prepared by applying said compo-<br>
sition onto a substrate, preferably by extrusion.<br>
To the semiconductive crosslinkable polyolefm composition, a crosslinking<br>
agent, preferably a peroxide, can be added.As already explained above, the<br>
point in time for adding the crosslinking agent can be varied. As an exam-<br>
ple, the crosslinking agent may be added to the semiconductive crosslink-<br>
able polymer composition when the unsaturated polyolefm is mixed with<br>
the carbon black in a compounding step, or after the compounding step in a<br>
separate process step. Furthermore, the crosslinking agent may be added<br>
during extrusion of the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition.<br>
As a further alternative, the crosslinking agent can be added during and/or<br>
after application of the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition<br>
onto the substrate. In this preferred embodiment, the crosslinking agent can<br>
be provided in an external reservoir from which it can migrate into the<br>
layer comprising the semiconductive crosslinkable composition. In the con-<br>
text of the present invention, an "external reservoir" is a reservoir which is<br>
not part of the layer comprising the semiconductive crosslinkable composi-<br>
tion. Preferably, the external reservoir is another layer also applied onto the<br>
substrate and containing the crosslinking agent. As explained above, the<br>
term "crosslinking agent" has to be defined in a broad sense. Thus, the<br>
other layer acting as a reservoir may comprise compounds not yet decom-<br>
posed but may also comprise radicals resulting from decomposition. From<br>
the other layer, the crosslinking agent migrates to the layer comprising the<br>
semiconductive crosslinkable composition. Thus, since the crosslinking<br>
agent is provided from an external reservoir during and/or after having<br>
been applied onto the substrate, the semiconductive crosslinkable polymer<br>
composition of the present invention can be extruded without crosslinking<br>
agent or at least with a very low amount of crosslinking agent.<br><br>
-14-<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the other layer acting as an external crosslink-<br>
ing agent reservoir is provided adjacent to the layer comprising the semi-<br>
conductive crosslinkable polymer composition to facilitate migration of the<br>
crosslinking agent. If necessary, migration is enhanced by thermal treat-<br>
ment of one of these layers or both layers.<br>
When sufficient crosslinking agent has been diffused into the semiconduc-<br>
tive crosslinkable composition, said composition can be treated under<br>
crosslinking conditions. If peroxides are used, crosslinking can be effected<br>
by raising the temperature to at least 160-170°C.<br>
Even if the crosslinking agent is added to the semiconductive crosslinkable<br>
polymer composition by migration from an external reservoir, it is possible<br>
to obtain a semiconductive polymer composition sufficiently crosslinked,<br>
as will be further demonstrated below in examples 11-12.<br>
Preferably, crosslinking results in a multilayered article having at least one<br>
layer in which the semiconductive crosslinked polymer composition has a<br>
hot set value, measured according to IEC 811-2-1, of less than 300 %, more<br>
preferably less than 200 %, and even more preferably less than 100 %.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the multi-layered article is a power cable, i.e.<br>
the crosslinkable composition is extruded onto a metallic conductor and/or<br>
at least one coating layer thereof for the preparation of a power cable.<br>
Preferably, it is the inner semiconductive layer which is prepared from the<br>
semiconductive crosslinkable polymer composition by treatment under<br>
crosslinking conditions. However, it is also possible to prepare the inner<br>
and the outer semiconductive layer from the crosslinkable polymer compo-<br>
sition.<br><br>
-15-<br>
Preferably, the crosslinked semiconductive polymer composition, which<br>
may be present as a power cable coating layer, satisfies the following rela-<br>
tionship:<br>
VR • CB • HS/1000000
wherein<br>
VR: volume resistivity in Ohm • cm, measured at 90°C,<br>
CB: wt% carbon black, based on the total weight of the crosslinked<br>
semi-conductive polymer composition, and<br>
HS hot set value in %, measured according to IEC 811-2-1.<br>
More preferable, VR • CB • HS/1000000 
1000.<br>
VR and HS are determined for a composition extruded as an inner cable<br>
layer at a line speed of 2.2 m/min.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the crosslinked semiconduc-<br>
tive polymer composition satisfies the following relationship:<br>
VR • CB • HS • S/1000000 
wherein<br>
VR, CB and HS have the same meaning as indicated above and S is the<br>
scorch volume in %, measured at 134.5°C. Again, VR and HS are deter-<br>
mined for a composition extruded as an inner cable layer at a line speed of<br>
2.2 m/min.<br>
More preferable, VR • CB • HS • S/1000000 S 

 <br>
-16-<br>
Preferably, the semi conductive crosslinked polymer composition has a vol-<br>
ume resistivity, measured at 90°C, of less than 500000 Ohm •cm, even<br>
more preferably less than 100000 Ohm •cm, and most preferably less than<br>
50000 Ohm •cm.<br>
In the present invention, the use of an unsaturated polyolefm having at least<br>
0.15 vinyl groups/1000 carbon atoms does not only increase crosslinking<br>
efficiency and production rate but also enables to reduce carbon black con-<br>
tent without adversely affecting volume resistivity. Furthermore, scorch<br>
can be suppressed effectively. Thus, even when the amount of carbon black<br>
is reduced, there is still a good balance between volume resistivity and<br>
scorch behavior. The improved balance enables to obtain a crosslinked<br>
semiconductive polymer composition satisfying the relationships men-<br>
tioned above.<br>
The invention is now further elucidated by making reference to the follow-<br>
ing examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Testing methods/measuring methods<br>
a) Determination of the content of double bonds<br>
The procedure for the determination of the number of vinyl groups/1000 C-<br>
atoms is based on the ASTM D-3124-72 method. In that method, a detailed<br>
description for the determination of vinyliden groups/1000 C-atoms is<br>
given based on 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene. This sample preparation proce-<br>
dure has been applied for the determination of vinyl groups/1000 C-atoms<br>
in the present invention. However, for the determination of the extinction<br>
coefficient for vinyl groups, 1-decene has been used, and the procedure as<br>
described in ASTM D-3124 section 9 was followed.<br><br>
-17-<br>
The degree of unsaturation was analyzed by means of IK-spectrometry and<br>
given as the number of vinyl bonds.<br>
The pure polymer is pressed at 150°C into a thin film and cooled down to<br>
room temperature. The thickness of the film is about 0.8-1.2 mm. The in-<br>
frared absorbance of the film is measured by a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spec-<br>
trometer Spectro 2000.<br>
The IR absorbance of the vinyl characteristic peak is determined from its<br>
peak height over a base line.<br>
The peak is defined by the maximum absorbance in the wave number range<br>
from 904-920 cm"1. The base line is defined through a linear connection<br>
between two points. These two points are set at the lowest absorbance in<br>
the wave number range from 910-990 cm "' and from 810-880 cm"1, respec-<br>
tivelv.<br>
The concentration of vinyl groups is expressed as the number of vinyl<br>
groups per 1000 carbon atoms in a polymer chain. This value is calculated<br>
from the infrared absorbance as determined above.<br>
The absorbance A (peak height at 910 cm -1), is related to the number of<br>
vinyl groups according to<br>
vinyl/1000 C-atoms = (14 x A )/13.13 x L x D),<br>
L is the thickness (in mm) of the measured polymer film, and<br>
D is the density (g/cm3) of the same film.<br>
b) Melt flow rate<br>
The melt flow rate is equivalent to the term "melt index" and is determined<br>
according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. Melt flow rate is de-<br>
termined at different loadings, such as 2.16 kg (MFR2) used for characteriz-<br><br>
-18-<br>
ing the base polymer or 21.6 kg (MFR21) for the semiconductive composi-<br>
tion. Melt flow rate is determined at a temperature of 190°C.<br>
c) Melt pressure/pressure of the inner semiconductive layer during ca-<br>
ble extrusion<br>
Cables with three layers have been made using the semiconductive compo-<br>
sition as inner and outer layer. The middle insulation layer is formed of<br>
low-density polyethylene LDPE (MFR2=2 g/10 min) containing 2 wt-% of<br>
dicumyl peroxide and 0.2 wt-% of 4,4'-thiobis(2-tert.-butyl-5-<br>
methylphenol).<br>
The construction of the cables is 50 mm stranded Al-conductor and 5.5<br>
mm thick insulation. The inner and outer semiconductive layers have a<br>
thickness of 0.9 mm and 0.8 mm, respectively. The cable line is a catenary<br>
Nokia Mailefer 1+2 system, thus one extrusion head for the inner conduct-<br>
ing layer and another for the insulation + outer semiconductive layer. The<br>
semiconductive layers have been exruded by a extruder of 45mm diameter<br>
and of a 24 length:diameter ration (L/D). The insulation layer has been<br>
exruded by a extruder of 60mm diameter and of a 24 L/D. The cables is<br>
cross-linked in the vulcanization tube using nitrogen and afterwards cooled<br>
in water. Cables were produced at different line speeds, i.e. 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4<br>
m/min.<br>
The term melt pressure refers to the pressure of the molten semiconductive<br>
composition measured at the tip of the extruder screw during production of<br>
the cables.<br>
d) Volume resistivity<br>
The volume resisitivity of the semiconductive material is measured on<br>
crosslinked polyethylene cables according to ISO 3915 (1981).<br><br>
-19-<br>
Cable specimens having a length of 13.5 cm are conditioned at 1 atm and<br>
60 ± 2°C for 5 ± 0.5 hours before measurement. The resistance of the outer<br>
semiconductive layer is measured using a four-terminal system using metal<br>
wires pressed against the semiconductive layer. To measure the resistance<br>
of the inner semiconductive layer, it is necessary to cut the cable in two<br>
halves, removing the metallic conductor. The resistance between the con-<br>
ductive silver paste applied onto the specimen ends is then used to deter-<br>
mine the volume resistivity of the inner semiconductive layer. The meas-<br>
urements were carried out at room temperature and 90°C.<br>
The same procedure is used to determine the volume resistivity of composi-<br>
tions that have not yet been crosslinked.<br>
e) Scorch<br>
A laboratory extruder is used with a specifically designed die for the<br>
evaluation of scorch in the die. A die with a relatively long channel (about<br>
25 mm in diameter and about 80 mm long) and a high residence time is<br>
used to promote scorch.<br>
The test can be carried out at a range of selected temperatures and uses a<br>
constant output of about 1 kg/h. The material is run continuously for at<br>
least 5 hours. After the test, the hot sample in the die is taken out. The<br>
amount of scorch is measured in the sample by examining 0.2-0.3 mm cross<br>
sections taken from 6 different position. The volume of scorch in the 6<br>
cross sections is measured by the use of a microscope. The mean value of<br>
the 6 cross sections is reported. Further information about the measurement<br>
of scorch volume can be found in EP 1 188 788 Al under the headline<br>
"Scorch (BTM 22527)".<br><br>
-20-<br>
f)	Hot set<br>
Specimen having been cut from the inner semi-conductive layers of the ca-<br>
bles described above. Hot set has been measured according to TEC 811-2-1.<br>
Hot set values are related to the degree of crosslinking, i.e. the higher a hot<br>
set value, the lower the degree of crosslinking.<br>
g)	Shear rate/shear stress/shear viscosity<br>
Shear rate, shear stress and shear viscosity were determined in a Rosand<br>
capillary rheometer having a piston diameter of 15 mm, a die length of 20<br>
mm, a die diameter of 1 mm and a die inlet angle of 180°. The preheating<br>
time was 10 minutes and the measurement temperature was 130°C.<br>
Examples 1 to 10<br>
6 semiconductive polymer compositions A-F according to the present in-<br>
vention were prepared. Furthermore, 4 comparative compositions Ref. 1 to<br>
Ref. 4 were prepared. All the compositions are based on ethylene buty-<br>
lacrylate copolymer with similar butylacrylate content and MFR (table 1).<br>
However, for compositions A-F, an increased amount of double bonds was<br>
introduced into the polyethylene by effecting polymerization of ethylene<br>
with 1,7-octadiene as a polyunsaturated comonomer. Each polymerization<br>
reaction was carried out in a high pressure tubular reactor at a pressure of<br>
2000-2500 bar and a temperature of 200-300°C.<br>
In Table 1, the relationship between the amount of unsaturation, indicated<br>
by the number of vinyl groups per 1000 carbon atoms, and the amount of<br>
1,7-octadiene is shown. In these runs, octadiene was added to the reactor<br>
and after having reached a stable octadiene concentration, samples were<br>
taken and analyzed. The results are compared to an ethylene butylacrylate<br>
copolymer made under the same conditions but without adding 1,7-<br>
octadiene .<br><br>
-21-<br>

0.9	0.38	7.4 .	18.4<br>
1.2	0.46	7.2	16.8<br>
The results of Table 1 clearly indicate that the number of vinyl groups in-<br>
creases with increasing amounts of octadiene comonomer.<br>
To all polymer compositions A-F and Ref. 1 to Ref. 4, a peroxide di(tert-<br>
butylperoxy-isopropyl)benzene) was added as a crosslinking agent. Fur-<br>
thermore, to obtain a semiconductive material, carbon black was added.<br>
The resultant semiconductive compositions are then extruded onto a cable,<br>
either as an inner semiconductive layer directly applied onto the cable con-<br>
ductor or as an outer semiconductive layer applied onto an insulation layer.<br>
Subsequently, the cable is guided through a vulcanization tube where the<br>
cable is heated to activate the peroxide and crosslink the polymer. Cables<br>
are run at different line speeds (i.e. from 1.6 to 2.4 m/'min) which means<br>
that the residence time in the vulcanization tube is shorter with increasing<br>
line speed.<br>
A summary of the semiconductive polymer compositions A-F and Ref. 1 to<br>
Ref. 4 is given in Table 2. Also provided are values for melt pressure<br>
within the extruder, volume resistivity of the inner and outer semi-<br>
conductive layer as a function of line speed, hot set, which is an indication<br>
for the degree of crosslinking, and formation of scorch.<br><br>
-22-<br><br><br>
Table 2: Summary of semi-conductive compositions<br><br>
-23-<br><br><br>
Table 2 continued<br><br>
-24-<br>
The results of Table 2 clearly indicate that in compositions according to the<br>
invention a sufficient electrical conductivity can be obtained with a reduced<br>
amount of carbon black. Furthermore, a good balance between improved<br>
electrical properties, high crosslinking efficiency and reduction of scorch<br>
results from the composition according to the invention.<br>
Comparing compositions A and B with Ref. 1, it is clearly indicated that<br>
the increased number of vinyl groups enables to lower the amount of perox-<br>
ide and reduce the formation of scorch. Although the amount of peroxide in<br>
compositions A and B is significantly lower than in Ref. 1, the degree of<br>
crosslinking at high line speed of 2.2 m/min (i.e. higher production rate) is<br>
even increasing, as indicated by the hot set values. The higher a hot set<br>
value, the lower the degree of crosslinking.<br>
Furthermore, although the amount and type of carbon black is the same in<br>
all samples, volume resistivity in compositions A and B is significantly im-<br>
proved.<br>
As explained above, the formation of scorch causes a number of problems<br>
like adhesion of the polymer gel to the surface of the equipment. However,<br>
the present invention enables to obtain a composition of sufficiently high<br>
electrical conductivity with reduced amount of peroxide, thereby also re-<br>
ducing the scorch. Thus, if the production rate is limited by the formation<br>
of scorch and the burden of cleaning, the invention enables to have longer<br>
cable runs until scorch occurs.<br>
Comparing composition C and Ref. 1, these compositions only differ in the<br>
amount of double bonds, indicated by the number of vinyl groups, whereas<br>
the amount of carbon black and peroxide, respectively, remains unchanged.<br>
Table 2 clearly indicates a decrease of volume resistivity, in particular at<br>
higher line speed, and an increase of the crosslinking degree whereas there<br><br>
-25-<br>
is only a slight increase of scorch. There is still a good balance between<br>
conductivity, crosslinking efficiency and scorch.<br>
Thus, if crosslinking speed is the limiting factor for the rate of cable pro-<br>
duction, the invention allows a faster production rate by using the same<br>
amount of peroxide or even less peroxide. Simultaneously, the electrical<br>
conductivity is even improved although the amount of carbon black re-<br>
mains unchanged.<br>
In composition D, the amount of carbon black is reduced if compared to<br>
Ref. 1. Rheological properties of Composition D and Ref. 1 are summa-<br>
rized in Table 3. As already discussed above, polymers having a high<br>
amount of fillers show rapidly increasing viscosity with decreasing shear<br>
rate and shear stress. Materials appear to become more "solid-like" as the<br>
filler particles are allowed to create a strong network within the polymer<br>
melt. This general trend is reflected in Table 3. However, for Ref. 1, the<br>
effect is much more pronounced. In particular, at lower shear rate and shear<br>
stress, compound D has a lower viscosity, thereby facilitating flow in criti-<br>
cal regions of the processing equipment and avoiding stagnancy or block-<br>
ing.<br>
Table 3: Relationship between shear rate and viscosity<br><br>
	REF 1	Compound D<br>
Shear rate (/s)	Shear stress Shear viscosity<br>
(kPa) (Pa.s)	Shear stress Shear viscosity<br>
(kPa) (Pa.s)<br>

50	282.67 5653	245.31 4906<br>
100	361.49 3615	316.99 3170<br>
198	457.26 2313	405.68 2051<br>
400	574.18 1435	511.21 1280<br>
600	647.56 1079	580.70 968<br>
801	703.13 878	629.33 787<br><br>
-26-<br>
The results of Table 3 clearly indicate that the invention allows faster and<br>
easier incorporation of carbon black during compounding and facilitates<br>
extrusion with less risk of stagnant zones and lower melt pressure.<br>
Furthermore, although the carbon black content of composition D has been<br>
reduced to improve rheological properties, volume resistivity is not ad-<br>
versely effected. On the contrary, at higher line speed (i.e. higher produc-<br>
tion rate), volume resistivity of composition D is even improved.<br>
The results for composition F indicate that the amount of carbon black can<br>
be even further reduced but still enables to have the good balance between<br>
rheological properties, electrical conductivity, crosslinking efficiency and<br>
scorch behavior. Furthermore, considering the amount of vinyl groups of<br>
composition F, the results of Table 2 demonstrate that an increase of vinyl<br>
groups beyond the lower limit of the present invention is necessary to ob-<br>
tain tne improved properties.<br>
Examples 11 to 12<br>
These examples show that the semiconductive compound of this invention<br>
can be sufficiently crosslinked without adding peroxide directly to the<br>
compound, but by a migration of peroxide from the insulation layer to the<br>
semiconductive layer. This is of particular interest, because this would<br>
mean that no peroxide needs to be present during extruding the semicon-<br>
ductive layer of a cable.<br>
The samples used are sandwich-type plaques (diameter about 8 cm) with<br>
one insulation layer (about 4 mm thick) and one semiconductive layer<br>
(about 1.3 mm thick). The insulation layer is formed of LDPE (MFR.2 -<br>
2g/10 min) containing 2 wt% of dicumyl peroxide and 0.2 wt% of 4,4'-<br>
thiobis(2-tert.-butyl-5-methylphenol), and the semiconductive layer is made<br>
of the semiconductive material to be tested.<br><br>
-27-<br>
The sandwich plaques are produced by means of a heatable laboratory<br>
press. Firstly, sheets of the insulation layer and the serniconductive layer<br>
are pressed individually at 120°C for 10 minutes. Secondly, the sheet of the<br>
insulation layer and the sheet of the serniconductive layer are brought to-<br>
gether and pressed together at 120°C for about 20 minutes. Thirdly, the<br>
temperature is increased to 180°C above the activation temperature of the<br>
peroxide. The sandwich plaque remains pressed together at 180°C for about<br>
30 minutes so that the crosslinking reaction is completed.<br>
Specimen having been cut from the serniconductive layer. Hot set has been<br>
measured according to IEC 811-2-1 using a load of lON/cm .<br>
The serniconductive materials to be tested were: Composition A but with-<br>
out peroxide added and composition REF1 but without peroxide added.<br>
The average hot set value of three tests of specimen of Example A without<br>
peroxide is 132%. However, when testing the example REF without perox-<br>
ide none of the three tests allowed a percent hot set to be determined, be-<br>
cause the specimen broke due to insufficient crosslinking. This shows that<br>
the serniconductive material of the invention has improved crosslinking<br>
properties that enable a sufficient crosslinking by the addition of peroxide<br>
through migration from the insulating layer.<br>
Examples 13 to 15<br>
Wafer Boil Test<br>
The wafer boil test is indicative whether the crosslinking degree of the<br>
serniconductive layer is sufficient.<br>
The wafer boil test has been performed according to AEIC CS5-94, 10th<br>
edition, section G.2, on cross sections of the cables described above. Only<br><br>
-28-<br>
the cables made at highest line speed (2.4 m/min) have been investigated,<br>
since these are most critical for the wafer boil test; i.e. least crosslinked.<br>
As described in the standard above, the wafers have been boiled in decahy-<br>
dronaphthalene for 5 hours. The wafers have been removed from the sol-<br>
vent and examined. A pass/fail results has been given as described in sec-<br>
tion D.5.1 of the above standard. Accordingly, if the inner semiconductive<br>
layer dissolves or cracks such that it does not maintain a continuous ring,<br>
the test result is "fail".<br>
Compositions A, D and REF1 have been subjected to the wafer boil test.<br>
However, only compositions A and D according to the present invention<br>
passed the test, as indicated in Table 4.<br>
Table 4: Results of wafer boil test<br><br>
Composition	A	D	REF 1<br>
Rating	passed	passed	failed<br>
Conclusion from this test:<br>
Although Examples A, D and REF1 appear to have a similar crosslinking<br>
degree as measured by the hot set test, the semiconductive material of the<br>
present invention is clearly superior in the wafer boil test, which also is a<br>
measure of the cross-linking degree. This suggests surprisingly that not<br>
only the crosslinking efficiency is enhanced by the increased number of<br>
vinyl groups but that, furthermore, the crosslinked polymer morphology is<br>
altered in a beneficial manner. This may lead also to the improved conduc-<br>
tivity of Examples A and D, although they have the same hot set and the<br>
same or less amount of carbon black compared to REF1.<br><br>
