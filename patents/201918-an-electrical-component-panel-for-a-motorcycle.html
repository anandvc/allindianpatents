				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an electrical component panel for a motorcycle.<br><br>
By a "notorcyole" is meant not only a motorcycle popnliriy so called, but also a two wheeler vehicle, such as, a soootor, a three wheeler vehicle, such as, an antorickihaw, a motorised vehicle used by the handicapped and other such vehicles.<br>
It is common knowledge that a motorcycle incorporates several electrical components snch as an ignition control nnit, aregulator, aflasher unit, arelay unit and so on.<br>
Snch electrical components are mounted in various places spred out on the vehicle and electric power is fed<br>
9<br>
from the generator, which is the prime source of electric power, to these electrical components through a wiring harness.<br>
A wirmg harness consists of several wires travellmg over the vehicle from front to rear and is an expensive commodity adding to the cost of the vehicle. Longer the win., in the vechicle. greater in the internal risistance abd other losses taking place in the harness. The length and size of the harness renders the the wiring job itself cumbersome and<br><br>
time conunning. Trouble vhooling and repairs and maintenance also become complex.<br>
In the conventional setup brackets are usnally welded to the frame at the placet the electrioal components are to be fitted. This not only creates an unaesthetic effect on the viower. bat also increases the man-honrs needed, daring manfacture, to provide such brackets by welding the brackets on to the frame.<br>
It is therefore an objact of this invention to propose an electrioal component panel for a motorcycle overcoming the abovementioned drawbacks and furishing the following advantages:<br>
l.The wiring harness is shnplified. The length of the<br>
wiring of the harness is snbatantially rednced.<br>
2.Assembly time of the various electrioal components at<br>
various pomts on the vehicle, at the factory level, is<br>
snbstantially reduced.        ,	.       ^<br>
3.	The use of brackets welded on to aframe  Is eilimated. In the proposed panel the electrical components are directly fitted in position, with suitable farfeners.<br>
4.	Genenlly, electrical components need provision for heat dissipation, the more the heat dissipated, the better<br><br>
fur the elecrical components, in the known vehicles provision for heat disspation has not, generally, been taken into full consideration, except perhaps in isolated cases such as, the engine. In the electrical component panel proposed heren. however, the member, serving as a support for mostly all the electrical components, has been carefully selected to provide acceptable heat dissipation as a result of exposure of the said member to optinum breeze when the vehicle is m motion. Such member it not a fitting extraneous to the vehicle, but is a part of the vehicle itself, thereby cutting down on cost Such member is selected from the crank case cover or the chain case cover of the vehicle. After several tests carried oat by us we have determined that such members satisfy the requirments of acceptable exposure of the set of electrical components to breeze created by the moving vehicle; Such members also satisfy the requirement that the electrical components and the generator are m jaxtapoation for the purpose of reducing the size of the wiring harness, whereby the length of the cables or wires in the harness are sufficient to receive and transmit electric power without the need to have lengthy wires with the reuhing disadvantages of the known art already referred to above.<br><br>
The varionB features of this invention will be apparent from the following (hither deicription thereof given herenader.<br>
The electrical component panel for a motorcycle, aoeording to thia invention, comprises electrical components of the vehicle connected to the generator of the vehicle for deriving electric power, characterised in that the said electrical components are formed mto t set, the generator and set being in jnxtaposition, electrically connected to each other; and in that the said set is supported on, and fixed to, at least one rigid member, provided as a part of the vehicle itself, said member being selected from at least one of the foUowiag parte of the vehicle, namely, (1) the crank case cover of the vehicle (2) the cham case cover of the said vehicle.<br>
This mvention will now be described with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawmgs which ilmstrate in flgl the conventunel aliayement fly 2 (a) and by way of <br><br>
example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible<br>
embodiments of the panel proposed herein.<br>
A set of electrical components collectively mdicated by C of the vehicle, such as, for example, an ignition control unit I, a regvlator R, a flasher unit F, a relay unit U and so on are electrically connected to the generator Q of the vehicle for deriving electric power. The said set<br><br>
of coimponents C and the generator G are in juxtaposition.<br>
The set of components C are supported on, and fixed to . at least one rigid member M, which is not an extraneous fitting for the vehicle, bat a rigid mechanical component provided in the vehicle itself Such member M has been carefully selected to provide optimum exposure of the set of components C to the breeze created when the vehicle is in motion, to cool the set of components C and thus achieve an acceptably high dissipation of heat. The said member is selected from (1) the crank case cover D (2) the chain case cover E (3) both the crank case cover D and the chain case cover E of the vehicle.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be observed that the electrical component panel proposed herein has substantial benefits and advintages over what is known to the art.<br>
The terms and expressions herem are of description and not of limitation, inasmuoh as there are various other embodiments of the panel proposed herein that are possible without departmg from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
We Clsim:<br>
I.An .electrical component Panel for a motorcycle comprising electrical componeonts of the vehicle connected to the generator of the vehicle for deriving electric power, characterised in that the aaid electrical componnts are formed into a set, the generator and act being in juxtaposition, electrically connected to each other, and in that the said let if supported on,and fixed to, at least one rigid member, provided as a part of the vehicle itself, said member bemg selected from at least one of the foUowmg parts of the vehicle, namely, (1) the crank case cover of the vehicle (2) the chain case cover of the said vehicle.<br>
