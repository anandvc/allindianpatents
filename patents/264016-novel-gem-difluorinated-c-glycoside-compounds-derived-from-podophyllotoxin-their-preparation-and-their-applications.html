				<td>The invention relates to a method for the synthesis of gem-difluorinated C-glycoside compounds derived from podophyllotoxin. It more particularly, but not exclusively, applies to the preparation of compounds which may be notably used in oncology for treating cancer.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Podophyllotoxin 1 is a lignan isolated from the roots of two plants Podophyllum peltatum (North America) and Podophyllum emodi (Asia). It has strong antimitotic activity by inhibiting polymerization of tubulin. Too toxic to<br>
be used in chemotherapy, it has	given rise to many antitumoral compounds<br>
after   structural   modifications.	Among   them,   glycosylated   derivatives,<br>
compounds which are usually	less toxic  and more water-soluble,  have<br>
emerged.  <br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br><br>
This the case of etoposide 2 (or VP-16) notably used in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, cancer of the bladder, of the testicles, of lymphomas, acute leukemias, Kaposi sarcomas.<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Nitrogen-containing derivatives of podophyllotoxin such as GL-331 5, NPF 6 or TOP-53 7 also show very interesting activities.<br>
All these molecules derived from the demethylepipodophyllotoxin structure are inhibitors of topoisomerase II, an enzyme which catalyses nicking and then reformation of the 2 DNA strands.<br>
We have  developed the  synthesis  of nitrogen-containing compounds of<br>
podophyllotoxin, with an amide function substituted with a gem-difluorinated<br>
glycoside.<br>
The importance of the CF2 group is in addition to its resistance against<br>
biochemical degradation processes, the fact that it forms an excellent mimick<br>
of oxygen. It thereby allows synthesis of non-hydrolyzable structures.<br>
Such compounds would be able to be used as chemotherapy agents in the treatment of different types of cancer, either alone or associated with other chemotherapies within the scope of a multitherapy.<br>
The developed molecules belong to the series of nitrogen-containing analogs of podophyllotoxin, a family having significant cytotoxicity. Further the presence of a glycoside is known for improving solubility in aqueous solvents, and for reducing toxicity.<br>
The use of difluorinated analogs in the anomeric position of the glycoside further reinforces their stability against acido-basic and especially enzymatic hydrolyses.<br>
For this purpose, the invention proposes a gem-difluorinated glycoconjugated compound with general formula I:<br><br><br>
wherein	R represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched alkyl,<br>

demethylepipodophyllotoxin 11, but the epimerized but non-dimethylated product is also observed in the medium: epipodophyllotoxin 12 (Fig. 1).

Synthesis of epipodophyllotoxin 12 and of 4'-demethvlepipodophvllotoxin<br>
11 (Fig, n<br>
Podophyllotoxin 1 (1.00 g; 2.29 mmol; 1 eq.) is dissolved in dry dichloromethane DCM (30 mL). Sodium iodide (1.03 g; 6.88 mmol; 3 eq.) is added and the reaction medium is stirred for 5 minutes. Methane-sulfonic acid MeSOsH (0.66 g; 0.45 mL; 6.88 mmol; 3 eq.) is slowly added at 0°C and the mixture is then warmed up to room temperature and stirred overnight. BaCO3 (0.54 g; 2.75 mmol; 1.2 eq.) and a water / acetone mixture (25 mL) are added into the medium at 0°C which is then stirred for one hour at room temperature. A 10% sodium thiosulfate Na2S203 aqueous solution (30 mL) is added to the reaction, which is then extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 30 mL). The organic phases are collected and washed with a saturated solution (50 mL) of sodium chloride, dried on magnesium sulfate MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The resulting red solid is purified by chromatography on silica gel with a dichloromethane / ethyl acetate mixture as en eluent, in proportions of eight to two.<br>
Epipodophyllotoxin 12 (0.17 g) and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 11 (0.44 g) are isolated as pale pink solids with a yield of 66% by weight.<br><br>

Synthesis of the gew-difluoroester derived from galactose 22b (Fig. 10)<br>
In a flask under an inert atmosphere containing zinc (3.34 g; 51 mmol; 7 eq.) activated beforehand, THF (60 mL) is added and the mixture is then refiuxed by heating. A solution consisting of the lactone derived from the galactose 21b (3.94 g; 7.3 mmol; 1 eq.) and of ethyl bromodifluoroacetate (2.83 mL; 22 mmol; 3 eq.) in THF (60 mL) is slowly added to the previous mixture. The reaction is stirred under reflux for three hours. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and a 1M solution of hydrochloric acid HCl (120 mL) is added, followed by addition of dichloromethane (120 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL) twice. The organic phases are dried on magnesium sulfate MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The residue is purified on a silica gel  chromatographic column with a cyclohexane / ethyl acetate mixture as an eluent in proportions of eight to two. The pure product 22b is isolated as a white solid with a yield of 82% by weight.<br>

Synthesis of the compound 30a (Fig. 15)<br>
The product 25a (30 mg; 0.051 mmol; 1 eq.) is dissolved in 5 mL of THF. The complex BH3.THF 1M (0.10 mL; 0.102 mmol; 2 eq.) is added onto the mixture at room temperature, and the reaction is refluxed for three hours. The reaction medium is left to return to room temperature. A IN HCl solution (10 mL) is added, and the aqueous phase is extracted with DCM (3x10 mL). The organic phases are washed with a saturated solution of NaCl (15 mL), dried on MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo in order to leave a wh1te solid.

Results of cytotoxicity<br>
The first cytotoxicity tests were conducted on different cell lines such as KB, PC3, MCF7 and MCF7R, SF268, HL60, HT29, A549 cells at concentrations of 10-5M in triplicate. Podophyllotoxin 1 and etoposide 2 were also tested under the same conditions as standards. The results are expressed as an inh1bition percentage of cellular growth.<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
It is observed that on th1s type of cells, the compound 27a has activity comparable with that of etoposide and of podophyllotoxin, and even better on certain cell lines. Also, the compound 32a tested on KB cells has cytotoxicity close to that of etoposide and podophyllotoxin, as well as 37a ,44a, 46a<br>
The IC50 values are expressed in µM on KB cells in duplicate and were obtained for the 4 leading compounds, i.e. 27a, 32a, 44a, 37a and 46a in parallel with podophyllotoxin and etoposide.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 For both of these compounds, interesting values are therefore observed in terms of cytotoxicity and of IC50 for the compounds 32a , 37a and 44a wh1ch makes these compounds good chemotherapy agents for treating cancer.<br>
