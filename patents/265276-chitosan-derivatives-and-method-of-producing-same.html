TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a chitosan derivative suitable as a filler for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a method of producing the same, and a separating agent for enantiomeric isomers using the chitosan derivative.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, the importance of an optically active compound has increased even more, and a method of selectively and efficiently producing a pure optically active chiral molecule from the viewpoint of research and development not only of Pharmaceuticals but also of functional materials is indispensable.<br>
The optical resolution by HPLC has been advanced as a method which can be used for both fractional analysis and microanalysis, and the development of various chiral fillers has been made so far. Among those, a substance obtained by converting a polysaccharide which abundantly exists in nature, such as cellulose, amylose, and the like to a phenylcarbamate derivative is widely used because such a substance has an excellent optical resolution performance of racemic bodies in a wide range including Pharmaceuticals as a<br>
chiral stationary phase for HPLC.<br>
Researches onpolysaccharides other than cellulose or araylose have been made. However, substance having an optical resolution performance equal to or higher than that of cellulose or amylose has not been obtained.<br>

The present invention provides a chitosan derivative represented by Formula (I),<br><br>
(Formula I Removed)<br><br>
where RI represents an aliphatic group or an aromatic group having<br>
a carbon number of 1 to 30 which may have a substituent, preferably an aliphatic group or an aromatic group having a carbon number of 1 to 15 which may have a substituent; R2 represents a substituent originating from an isocyanic acid derivative, a carboxylic acid, an ester, an acid halide, an acid amide compound, a halide compound, an aldehyde or an alcohol; and n is an integer of 5 or more.<br>

Still further, the present invention provides a separating agent for an enantiomeric isomer including the chitosan derivative, use thereof, and a method of separating an enantiomeric isomer using the chitosan derivative.<br>
The chitosan derivative of the present invention has high optical resolution performance.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chitosan derivative of the present invention is represented by the above Formula (I), and can be obtained by the following production methods.<br>
There is no limitation on chitosan as a starting material and, for example, a deacetylated chitin or a commercially available chitosan may be used. As commercially available chitosan, chitosans available by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, or Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd can be mentioned, for example.<br>
First, an amino group at the 2-position of chitosan is imidized. There is no limitation on the imidization reaction, and a known imidization reaction can be applied.<br>
The imidization reaction can be performed by acting a known acid anhydride capable of introducing RI to the amino group at the 2-position. For example, mentioned is a method that the amino group at the 2-position is subjected to N-acylation by using an acylating agent (phthalic anhydride) , and dehydrating the resultant by heating (method 1) . Or, mentioned is a method of acting an acylating agent (phthalic anhydride) on the amino group at the 2-position of chitosan in a mixed solvent of DMF/water at volume ratio of 95/5, and drying the same (method 2).<br>
Next, the hydroxyl groups at the 3- and 6-positions of chitosan are reacted with a compound selected from an isocyanic acid derivative, carboxylic acid, ester compound, acid halide, acid amide compound, halide compound, aldehyde, and alcohol. Among those, it is desirable to react with carboxylic acid or an isocyanic acid derivative.<br>
As carboxylic acid, benzoic acid, 4-methylbenzoic acid,<br>
cinnamic acid, etc. can be used, for example.<br>
The isocyanic acid derivative is representedbyR-NH-C=0 where, R represents : a hydrogen atom; an aliphatic group, an aromatic group or the like, whose carbon number is 1 to 30, and preferably 1 to 14. Specifically, isocyanic acid derivatives represented by R-NH-C=0 (where, R represents a hydrogen atom, an isopropyl group, a phenyl group, a methylphenyl group, a 3,5-dimethylphenyl group, a chlorophenyl group, a dichlorophenyl group, a (S) - cx-methylbenzyl group, etc.), can be used.<br>
The chitosan derivative of the present invention is represented by Formula (I) , andRi andR2 are preferably selectedfrom the following. In the chitosan derivative of the present invention, n showing a degree of polymerization is 5 or more, and preferably 5 to 1000.<br>
R1 is preferably any one of the following.<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
In Formula (I), it is preferable that R2 be a carbamate derivative or an ester derivative. It is more preferable that R2 be an aromatic carbamate derivative or an aromatic ester derivative .<br>
It is still more preferable that R2 be a carbamate derivative represented by the following formula;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where X is 3,5-dimethyl, 3,5-dichloro, or 3,4-dichloro.<br>
The chitosan derivative of the present invention may be used as it is or, if needed, the chitosan derivative physically or chemically carried on a carrier by a known method can be used as a separating agent for enantiomeric isomers for HPLC, etc.<br>
As the carrier, a known porous organic carrier or a porous inorganic carrier can be used, and a porous inorganic carrier is preferable. Examples of suitable porous organic carriers are polymers include polystyrene, polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, etc. Examples of suitable porous inorganic carriers include silica, alumina, magnesia, glass, kaolin, titanium oxide, silicate, hydroxyapatite, etc., and silica gel is particularly preferable.<br>
When using silica gel, in order to eliminate the influence of the residual silanol on the silica gel surface and to improve the affinity with an optically active molecular compound, it is desirable to treat the surface of silica gel by silanizing (silanizing using aminoalkylsilane), plasma treatment, etc., but no problem arises even when no surface treatment is performed.<br>
The particle diameter of a porous carrier, in particular silica gel, is preferably 1 to 300 µm, more preferably 1 to 100 µm, and still more preferably 1 to 50 µm. The average fine pore diameter<br>
thereof is preferably 200 to 8000 Å, more preferably 200 to 4000 Å, and still more preferably 300 to 2000 Å. The particle diameter of the porous carrier is substantially the particle diameter of a separating agent.<br>

Example  I<br>
[N-phthaloyl  chitosan 3,6-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)]<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
A chitosan derivative was produced according to the above reaction formula. First, 0.85g of phthalic anhydride was added to 0.31g of chitosan in a methanol solution containing 2% of acetic acid (pH 4), and the mixture was reacted at 35°C for 12 hours.<br>
Subsequently, the resultant reaction mixture was placed in an aqueous 2% of sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 8) , and 0.76g of phthalic anhydride was added. The mixture was reacted at 35°C for 12 hours to complete the acylation of the 2-position of chitosan, thereby collecting the resultant as an acidic hydrochloride (0.60 g yield).<br>
Then, the chitosan whose 2-posit ion had been acylated was dried by heating under reduced pressure at 200°C for 5 hours to complete<br><br>
cyclization by dehydration, thereby imidizing at the 2-position. The reaction was confirmed by IR. Then, 0 . 20 g of the chitosan whose<br>
2	-positionhadbeen imidizedwas taken, and 6 ml of dehydratedpyridine<br>
and 0.29 g of 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added thereto,<br>
and then heated at 80°C for 21 hours. Then, 21 hours later, the<br>
progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR.  Then, 0.11g of<br>
3	 5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate was added, and the mixture was further<br>
heated at 80°C for 5 hours to thereby complete the reaction. The<br>
reaction product was collected as an insoluble part of mixed solvents<br>
of MeOH and water at a volume ratio of 4/1. Since it was confirmed<br>
by IR that urea was contained therein, a THF soluble part was<br>
precipitated twice to remove urea, obtaining 0.24 g (62%) yield.<br>
The obtained chitosan derivative was soluble in acetone, DMSO, THF,<br>
DMF, DMA, chloroform, and pyridine.<br>

The resultant was poured in cold water and obtaining 0.64 g (89%) yield.<br>
For complete imidization, 0.60 g of the resultant was dried by heating under reduced pressure at 200°C for 2 hours. Then, 8 ml of dehydratedpyridine and 0 . 99 gof 3 , 5-dichlorophenyl isocyanate were added, and the mixture was made to react by heating at 80°C. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and the resultant was collected over 27 hours as an insoluble part of mixed solvents of Methanol and water at a volume ratio of 4/1. A THF soluble part was re-precipitated, obtaining 0.81 g (67%) yield. The obtained chitosan derivative was soluble in THF, DMF, DMA, and pyridine.<br>

The resultant was poured in cold water, and washed with methanol and collected, obtaining 0.89 g (90%) yield.<br>
0.80 g of the resultant was dried under reduced pressure at 200 °C for 2 hours, and then 12ml of pyridine and 1.2 g of 3, 5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 hours, and then was dissolved completely. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and the resultant was collected as a methanol insoluble part, obtaining 1.3 g (82%) yield. The obtained chitosan derivative was soluble in acetone, THF, DMF, DMA,<br><br>
chloroform, and pyridine.<br>

The resultant was poured in cold water, and washed with methanol and collected, obtaining 0.75 g (98%) yield.<br>
0.60 g of the resultant was dried under reduced pressure at 200°C for 2 hours, and then 12ml of pyridine and 1.1 g of 3, 5-dichlorophenyl isocyanate were added. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 hours, and then was dissolved completely. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and the resultant was collected as a methanol insoluble part, obtaining 1.1 g (84%) yield. The<br>
obtained chitosan derivative was soluble in THF, DMA, andpyridine.<br>
Example 5<br>
(Production of a separating agent for enantiomeric isomers)<br>
The chitosan derivatives obtained in Examples 1 to 4 were dissolved in THF, and were carried on silica gel subjected to a surface treatment, obtaining a separating agent for enantiomeric isomers. Those separating agents were separated by particle diameters with Hexane-2-propanol (9:1), and packed in a stainless steel column having a length of 25 cm and an inner diameter of 0.46 cm using Hexane-2-propanol (9:1) by the slurry method.<br>
Column 1 (inner diameter 0.46 cm) : Chitosan derivative of Example 1<br>
Column 2 (inner diameter 0.46 cm) : Chitosan derivative of Example 2<br>
Column 3 (inner diameter 0.46 cm) : Chitosan derivative of Example 3<br>
Column 4 (inner diameter 0.46 cm) : Chitosan derivative of Example 4<br>
Application Example 1 (Measurement by HPLC)<br>
Optical resolution of racemic bodies by HPLC was performed using each of the separating agents for enantiomeric isomers of Example 5. A pump (PU-980 manufactured by JASCO Corporation) was<br>
used for the measurement, and JASCO UV-970 and an optical rotation JASCO OR-990 were used for the detection. The following racemic bodies (2 to 19) were evaluated for the separation ability.<br>
Hexane-2-propanol (9:1) was mainly used as a mobile phase, and the flow rate was set as 0.5 ml/min in the column with an inner diameter of 0.46 cm. The measurement was performed at room temperature. A theoretical plate number was determined by benzene-eluent (1:10) and t0 was determined by 1,3,5-tri-tert-buthylbenzene.<br>
Volume ratio ki',k2': when a period of time during which a mobile phase passes through the column without any adsorption is defined as t0 and an elution time of each enantiomer is defined as t1 or t2, k1' or k2' shows the adsorbability of each enantiomer to a filler, which is determined by the following formula:<br>
k1' = (t1-t0)/t0 <br>
Resolution coefficient α= k2'/k1<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The evaluation results of columns 1 to 4 are shown in Table 1, together with optical resolution abilities of derivatives whose 2-, 3-, and 6-positions were reacted with isocyanate (Comparative Examples 1 and 2), synthesized previously.<br>

Example 6<br>
N-(1,2-cyclohexanedicarbonyl)chitosan<br>
3,6-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A chitosan derivative was produced according to the above reaction formula. First, for N-acylationof 0.20 gof chitosan (which was obtained by repeatedly (three times) deacetylating chitosan of wako-100 (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 120°C for 2 hours in an aqueous 50% NaOH solution), 0.54 g of cis-1, 2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride was added under acidic conditions for reaction for 11 hours, and 0.51g of anhydride was addedunder basic conditions for reaction for 12 hours. The resultant was collected under acidic conditions, obtaining 0.26 g (68%) yield (MF2a-l) . The resultant was heated at 220 °C under reduced pressure<br>
for 5 hours, and then the progress of imidization was observed by IR (MF2b-l). 86 mg of the resultant was taken, and reacted with 0.24 g of 3, 5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate in a dehydrated pyridine at 80°C. 21 hours later, 0.23 g of isocyanate was further added. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR after 27 hours and a methanol insoluble part was collected, but the reaction nonuniformly progressed to the end. The resultant was stirred and washedinDMSO, obtaining 62 mg (37%yield) of insoluble part (MF2c-l) . Since the reaction might not progress completely, 0.24 mg of a newly dried N-(1,2-cyclohexanedicarbonyl) chitosan was swollen in 0.75ml of DMA. Then, 65 mg of LiCl, 0.4 ml of pyridine, and 0.21 g of isocyanate were added and reacted for 20 hours. Then, 0.22 g of isocyanate was newly added, but the reaction nonuniformly progressed. Then, 4 hours later, the resultant was collected as a methanol insoluble part, and 21 mg (40%) of the reaction product was obtained (MF2c-2).<br>
Example 7<br>
N-malenoyl chitosan 3,6-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) <br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A chitosan derivative was produced according to the above reaction formula. First, the reaction was performed as shown in the scheme of the following Method 1. 0.36 g of maleic anhydride was added to 0.21 g of chitosan under acidic conditions for reaction for 12 hours, and then 0.35 g of anhydride was added under basic conditions. However, the white precipitate which was deposited remained insoluble even after 12 hours. When the insoluble part and the soluble part were separated and only the soluble part was made acidic, the reaction apparently progressed was confirmed by IR spectrum, and27mg (8%) yield was obtained (MF4a-l) . In contrast, no reaction progressed in the insoluble part, and the reaction was further performed. However, only a comparable yield was obtained from the soluble part and the insoluble part remained unreacted. Next, 17 mg of the resultant was heated under reduced pressure at 200°C for 5 hours, obtaining 15 mg (95%) of a cyclic compound (MF4b-l) .<br>
Example 8<br>
N-malenoyl chitosan 3 , 6-bis (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A chitosan derivative was produced according to the above reaction formula. 0.34 g of maleic anhydride was dissolved in 10 ml of mix solvent of DMF and water, and 0.20 g of chitosan was added, followed by subjected to half-reaction at 120°C for 8 hours. The resultant was poured in cold water, obtaining 0.23 g (77%) yield (MF4b-2).<br>
Inthiscase, the progress of the reaction was confirmed. Thus, 98 mg of this derivative was dried at 200°C, and then 4 ml of pyridine and 240 mg of 3 , 5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added for reaction. 21 hours later, due to a large amount of insoluble parts, 96 mg of isocyanate was added for reaction for a further 6 hours . However, the insoluble parts were not completely dissolved, and collected as an insoluble part of mixed solvents of methanol and water at a volume ratio of 5/1. The yield was 172 mg (80%) (MF4c-l).<br>
Example 9<br>
N-(4-chloro)phthaloyl chitosan tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)<br>
3.6 g of 4-chlorolphthalic anhydride was dissolved in 30 ml of DMF/water at volume ratio of 95/5, and 1.0 g of chitosan was added. The mixture was stirred at 120°C for 8 hours, and thus a gel was formed. The resultant was poured in 200 mL of cold-water, and collected by centrifugal separation, followed by drying by heating using an oven at 200 °C for 1.5 hours, obtaining 2.5 g (95%) yield (MF9b-2).<br>
1.0 g of the resultant was dried, and then 15 ml of pyridine and 1.3 g of 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added, followed by stirring. Since the viscosity increased 2 hours later, 7 mL of pyridine was added. 1.0 g of isocyanate was added again 4 hours later, and the mixture was stirred for further 16 hours . The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and then the resultant was re-precipitated in methanol and collected, obtaining 1.7 g (92%) yield (MF9c-2).<br>

Then, 15 ml of pyridine and 1.6 g of 3, 5-diclorophenyl isocyanate<br>
were added, followed by stirring.  0.8 g of isocyanate was added again 6 hours later, and stirred for further 16 hours. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and then the resultant was re-precipitated in methanol and collected, obtaining 2.3 g (99%) yield (MF9d-2).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Example 11<br>
N-(4-chloro)phthaloyl chitosan tris(3,4-dichlorophenylcarbamate) 0.4 of MF9b-2 was dried in the same manner as in Example 9. Then, 8 ml of pyridine and 1.2 g of 3,4-diclorophenyl isocyanate were added, followed by stirring at 80°C. 0.8 g of isocyanate was added again 11 hours later, and stirred for further 10 hours. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and then the resultant was re-precipitated in methanol and collected, obtaining 0.80 g (95%) yield (MF9q-l).<br><br>

Example 12<br>
N-phthaloyl chitosan tris(3,4-dichlorophenylcarbamate)<br>
5. 7 gof phthalic anhydride was dissolved in 120 ml of DMF/water at volume ratio of 95/5 , and 2 . 0 g of chitosan was added. The mixture was stirred at 120°C for 20 hours, and thus a gel was formed. The resultant was poured in 200 mL of cold-water, and collected by centrifugal separation, obtaining 3.3 g (90%) yield (MFlb-9).<br>
1.0 g of the resultant was dried, and then 20 ml of pyridine and 1.7 g of 3,4-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added, followed by stirring. 1.2 g of isocyanate was added again hours later, and the mixture was stirred for further 12 hours. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and then the resultant was re-precipitated in methanol and collected, obtaining 2.4 g (99%)<br>
yield (MFlq-1).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Example 13<br>
N- (4-methyl) phthaloyl chitosan tris (3 , 4-dichlorophenylcarbamate) 6.0 g of (4-methyl)phthalic anhydride was dissolved in 120 ml of DMF/water at volume ratio of 95/5, and 2.0 g of chitosan was added. The mixture was stirred at 120°C for 11 hours, and thus a gel was formed. A supernatant was removed, the resultant was poured in 200 mL of cold-water and collected by centrifugal separation,<br>
obtaining 3.3 g (86%) yield (MF5b-5).<br>
1.0 g of the resultant was dried, and then 20 ml of pyridine and 1.7 g of 3,4-dimethylphenyl isocyanate were added, followed by stirring at 80°C. Then, the viscosity increased 14 hours later, and therefore 10 mL of pyridine and 0.5 g of isocyanate were added, followed by stirring for further 8 hours. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by IR, and then the resultant was re-precipitated in methanol and collected, obtaining 2.3 g yield. A DMSO insoluble part was removed, and then the resultant was precipitated again in methanol, followed by drying, thereby obtaining 1.6 g (72%) yield (MF5q-l-re).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Example 14 (Preparation of a separating agent for enantiomeric isomers)<br>
The chitosan derivatives obtained in Examples 9 to 13 were applied to silica gel in the same manner as in Example 5, and the resultant was packed in a column (inner diameter of 0.46 cm)  The column was referred to as follows.<br>
N- (4-chloro) phthaloyl chitosan tris (3 , 5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (MF9C-2) → MFp-25<br>
N- (4-chloro) phthaloyl chitosan tris (3 , 5-dichlorophenylcarbamate) (MF9d-2) → MFp-26<br>
N- (4-chloro) phthaloyl chitosan tris (3 , 4-dichlorophenylcarbamate) (MF9q-l) → MFp-27<br>
W-phthaloyl chitosan tris(3,4-dichlorophenylcarbamate) (MFlq-1) → MFp-18<br>
N- (4-methyl) phthaloyl chitosan tris (3 , 4-dichlorophenylcarbamate) (MF5q-l-re) → MFp-19<br>
Application Example 2  (Measurement by HPLC)<br>
Each column of Example 14 was evaluated for the optical resolution performance of a chiral stationary phase in the same manner as in Application Example 1. The evaluation results are shown below. <br><br>
