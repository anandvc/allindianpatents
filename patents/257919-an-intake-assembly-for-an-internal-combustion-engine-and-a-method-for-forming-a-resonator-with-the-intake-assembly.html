INTAKE ASSEMBLY WITH INTEGRAL RESONATORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an intake assembly incorporating a<br>
supercharger having integral resonators formed on an inlet side of a supercharger<br>
housing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Various methods may be employed to reduce the intake noise of an<br>
internal combustion engine. One method is to use a Helmholtz resonator on an intake<br>
air pipe configured to communicate intake air to the internal combustion engine. The<br>
intake air pipe is typically disposed upstream from an intake manifold and is configured<br>
to communicate intake air to the intake manifold of the internal combustion engine. A<br>
Helmholtz resonator includes a resonance volume or chamber having a small opening,<br>
typically referred to as a neck. The neck is operable to enable communication between<br>
the resonance chamber and the intake air pipe. Sound waves generated by components<br>
within the internal combustion engine travel along the intake air pipe where their<br>
acoustic pressure impinges on the neck. This acoustic pressure excites a mass of air<br>
within the neck. The acoustic pressure within the resonance chamber reacts against the<br>
air mass within the neck and produces an out-of-phase acoustic pressure at the intake<br>
air pipe to cause cancellation of intake noise at the resonant frequency. In this way,<br>
some of the engine noise is eliminated as the out-of-phase acoustic pressures in the<br>
intake air pipe cancel each other.<br>
[0003]	The frequency at which the attenuating acoustic pressures reach their<br>
maximum amplitude is known as the resonant frequency. A number of parameters<br>
determine the resonant frequency and bandwidth of a Helmholtz resonator, including<br>
the volume of the resonance chamber and the length and cross sectional area of the<br>
neck.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	An intake assembly, such as a supercharger assembly, is provided for an<br>
internal combustion engine. The intake assembly includes a housing having a wall<br>
defining an inlet passage through which intake air enters the intake assembly. A<br>
plurality of stiffening ribs are provided on the wall opposite the inlet passage and at<br>
least partially define at least one cavity. A plate is mounted to the wall of the housing<br>
and further defines the at least one cavity. The wall defines at least one orifice<br>
configured to provide communication between the inlet passage and the at least one<br>
cavity. The at least one cavity and the at least one orifice cooperate to form at least one<br>
resonator. Preferably, the plate is sealingly engaged with the wall of the housing, such<br>
as by a gasket member, sealant, etc.<br>
[0005]	A method of forming integral resonators within the intake assembly is<br>
also provided including the steps of: A) forming the orifices in the housing operable to<br>
provide communication between the inlet passage and the cavities; and B) mounting the<br>
plate to the housing to further define the cavities. As mentioned hereinabove, the<br>
orifices and the cavities cooperate to form the resonator. The method further includes<br>
the step of sealing the plate with respect to the housing.<br>
[0006]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
perspective view of an intake assembly or supercharger 10 for an internal combustion<br>
engine, not shown. Although the intake assembly is illustrated in Figure 1 as a<br>
supercharger 10; those skilled in the art will recognize that the intake assembly may have<br>
other forms, such as an intake manifold, while remaining within the scope of that which<br>
is claimed. The supercharger assembly 10, as shown in Figure 1, is a roots-type or<br>
screw-type supercharger and includes a housing 12 having a wall 14 that at least partially<br>
defines an inlet passage 16. The inlet passage 16 is configured to communicate intake<br>
air, indicted by arrow 18, into the supercharger assembly 10. The housing 12 further<br>
defines a rotor cavity 20 within which a first and second rotor 22 and 24, respectively are<br>
rotatably contained. The first and second rotors 22 and 24 are counter-rotating with<br>
respect to each other and cooperate to transfer volumes of intake air 18 as it passes<br>
through the rotor cavity 20 to an exit port 26 defined by the housing 12 where it is<br>
subsequently introduced to the internal combustion engine, not shown.<br>
[0012]	A plurality of stiffening ribs 28 are provided on the housing 12 to prevent<br>
distortion of the housing 12 during operation of the supercharger assembly 10. The<br>
stiffening ribs 28 are preferably arranged in a generally cross-wise arrangement to form a<br>
waffle pattern. Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a bottom view of the<br>
supercharger assembly 10. The stiffening ribs 28 cooperate to partially define a plurality<br>
of cavities or volumes 30 on the side of the wall 14 opposite the inlet passage 16. A<br>
plurality of orifices 32 are defined by the wall 14 and are configured to allow<br>
communication between the cavities 30 and the inlet passage 16. Referring to Figure 3,<br><br>
GP-309101-PTE-JK<br>
4<br>
there is shown a bottom view of the intake assembly 12 having a plate 34 mounted to the<br>
housing 12 by a plurality of fasteners 35. Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown a<br>
cross sectional view of the housing 12 taken along line 4-4 of Figure 3. The plate 34<br>
further defines the cavities 30. The plate 34 is sealed with respect to the housing by a<br>
gasket member 36. Alternately, a sealant, such a room temperature vulcanizing (RTV)<br>
sealant, may be used in lieu of the gasket member 36. Since a vacuum is typically<br>
present within the inlet passage 16 during operation of the supercharger assembly 10, it is<br>
beneficial to seal the plate 34 to prevent the unwanted entry of air into the cavities 30 and<br>
the inlet passage 16. The plate 34 is preferably formed from a material possessing<br>
sufficient structural rigidity to avoid deflection. Additionally, the plate 34 may further<br>
tend to increase the rigidity of the wall 14 of the housing 12.<br>
[0013]	As illustrated in Figure 4, the cavities 30 and orifices 32 cooperate to form<br>
resonators 38, such as a Helmholtz resonator. The cavities 30 form resonance chambers,<br>
while the orifices 32 form necks. The frequency at which the resonators 38 attenuate<br>
may be varied by varying the volume of the cavities 30 and/or the volume of the orifices<br>
32. Multiple frequencies may be attenuated by providing cavities 30 and orifices 32 of<br>
varying dimensions or geometries. Additionally, multiple orifices 32 may be provided in<br>
communication with each of the cavities 30, as shown in Figure 4. The resonator 38 may<br>
also be provided with orifices 32 and cavities 30 having a constant cross sectional area<br>
such that the resonator 38 forms a quarter wave resonator.<br>
[0014]	By positioning the resonators 38 near the noise source, i.e. the<br>
supercharger assembly 10, the pressure pulses acting on the housing 12 may be reduced<br>
resulting in less radiation of noise than with noise attenuation devices mounted further<br>
upstream of the inlet passage 16 of the supercharger assembly 10. Additionally, the<br>
flow of intake air 18 through the intake passage 16 may improve by employing the<br>
resonators 38 as a result of the cancellation of pressure pulses within the inlet passage<br>
16 of the supercharger assembly 10.<br>
[0015]	A method of forming integral resonators 38 within the supercharger<br>
assembly 10 is also provided including the steps of: A) forming the orifices 32 in the<br>
housing 12 operable to provide communication between the inlet passage 16 and the<br><br>
GP-309101-PTE-JK<br>
5<br>
cavities 30; and B) mounting the plate 34 to the housing 12 to further define the<br>
cavities. As mentioned hereinabove, the orifices 32 and the cavities 30 cooperate to<br>
form the resonator 38. The method further includes the step of sealing the plate 34<br>
with respect to the housing 12. The orifices 32 may be formed by machining the<br>
housing 12 such as by drilling or reaming. Alternately, if the housing 12 is a cast<br>
component, the orifices 32 may be formed by pin-like mold features, not shown,<br>
disposed within a mold, not shown, and used to form the housing 12. The pin-like<br>
mold features may form closed ended bores, such that the orifices 32 are formed by the<br>
removal of material from the resulting closed ended bores during the machining of the<br>
inlet passage 16.<br>
[0016]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
