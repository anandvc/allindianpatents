Description<br>
Devices for Mounting a Cylinder, Printing Unit and Method for Setting a Print-On-Position<br>
The invention relates to devices for mounting a cylinder, a printing unit and method for setting a print-on-position according to the introductory part of the claim 1, 2, 31, 45 or 48.<br>
From the document WO 95/24314 Al we know of such a printing unit where four duplex printing mechanisms are arranged vertically above one another and are movable horizontally with respect to one another in the region of their duplex printing position. For this, the printing mechanisms of a same web side are mounted in a common frame, whereby at least one of the frames is movable horizontally.<br>
The document EP 12 64 686 Al describes a printing unit with duplex printing mechanisms arranged vertically above one another, where the printing mechanism cylinder is mounted in a central frame portion and both the inking units are respectively mounted in the outer frame portions. These outer frame portions can be moved horizontally relative to the central frame portion in order to bring in plate handling devices in the intermediate space if required.<br>
From the document DE 22 34 089 C3 we know of an offset roller rotary printing machine, where a wall section having several printing mechanisms can be moved against a wall section having the corresponding impression cylinder. The printing mechanism cylinder as well as the allocated inking units are together mounted as units in this wall section and are movable or removable.<br>
The document DE 43 27 278 C2 describes a printing unit with a construction of a side frame, to which transmission cylinders and stereo cylinder of a certain circumference format are mounted in a rotate-able manner and depending on the requirement modular inking units of a particular type out of various printing unit types can be used.<br><br>
2<br>
The document US 25 57 381 A describes a printing unit that can be flexibly erected for different printing processes and different number of printing points, where the inking units and the printing cylinder are respectively placed on top of one another in the form of a tower and are arranged as such movable towards or away from one another. Different types and different numbers of printing units and inking units or inking systems can be selectively used in a standard frame.<br>
From the document EP 02 46 081 A2 we know of a printing unit with several component units having the printing cylinder of the printing mechanism, as well as with units designed as inking units. The inking units can be set horizontally on the printing cylinder for switching on/off and can be brought vertically in contact with different printing mechanisms - a. o. also with different printing mechanisms having different printing lengths. The component units having the printing cylinders can be replaced by component units of other printing lengths, if required.<br>
The document DE 102 02 385 A1 shows a drive draw between the cylinders of a printing mechanism with variable printing length, whereby two intermediate gears are arranged between cylinder spur not mating with one another.<br>
From the document EP 06 99 524 B1 we know of drive draws of printing units, whereby in one development a pair-wise driving of the printing cylinders takes place by means of a single motor through spur gears mating with one another.<br>
In the document WO 03/039872 Al we find printing cylinders, which in a development are driven pair-wise by a drive motor and the gear unit coupling both the cylinders is encased in an independent housing.<br>
The document DE 195 34 651 Al describes a printing unit with cylinders lying on one plane, where three out of four are mounted linearly movable along the cylinder plane to the print-on-position or print-off-position. The mounting is done in channel elements<br><br>
3<br>
provided in the frame inner wall. The cylinders are mounted in beams on the common channel elements and can be set against on another or removed from one another by means of working cylinders operated by pressure agents.<br>
From the document WO 02/081218 A2 we know of individual linear mountings for two transmission cylinders mounted respectively in saddles, whereby a setting drive can be executed for the saddles as in the case of cylinders that can be loaded with pressure agents. In order to define an end position for the setting movement running transverse to the cylinder plane an adjustable buffer stop is foreseen.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create a mounting for printing cylinders that is easy to manufacture and operate, a printing unit comprising these mountings and a method for setting the printing cylinders.<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention by means of the features given in claim 1, 2, 31, 45 or 48.<br>
The advantages that can be achieved with the invention particularly lie in the fact that a printing unit can be created that is easy to manufacture and/or simple to operate, at the same time maintaining high print quality.<br>
By means of a separable side frame in a development, one can achieve a good accessibility, a contribution to possible modularity and a low structural height.<br>
Through the usage of linear channels for the printing cylinders an ideal mounting position for the cylinders can be achieved with respect to possible cylinder vibrations. Apart from that, on account of the cylinder mounting in linear channels low setting paths can be realised and hence no synchronous spindle is required. The cumbersome mounting of triple ring bearings can be avoided. The cylinder mountings arranged on the inner side of the side frames but not penetrating them, allow side frames without specific mounting holes. The frames can be designed independent of any particular format. A cylinder unit<br><br>
4<br>
along with pre-set mounting can be mounted on the spot in the frame walls without any problems. On account of the module size (cylinder plus bearing units) comprising only one cylinder, cylinder formats of different size can be used and, if required even combined.<br>
On account of one or more already mentioned specifications created for modularity, there is a significant potential for savings as the number of individual component groups gets increased in the design as well as in the production.<br>
As the drives of the printing cylinders and/or the individual inking units are executed with single motors or as closed gear unit modules, lubricating agents are present only in the already prefabricated functional modules.<br>
The bearing on the inside of the side frames, apart from the simple mounting, also allows shortening of the cylinder dowel pins which reduces the vibration.<br>
The mentioned design of linear bearings with movable buffer stops allows print-relevant setting of the cylinder and also an automatic basic setting - for a new configuration, a new print blanket etc.<br>
In a design of a modular operating automat, for different formats a simple plate replacement is possible as desired.<br>
Design examples of the invention are depicted in the drawings and are described in more details below.<br>

A printing machine, e.g. roller rotary printing machine especially a multicolour roller rotary printing machine has a printing unit 01 in which a material web 02, can be printed once on both sides or successively several times, e. g. here four times, or even e\several webs can be printed simultaneously once or several times. The printing unit 01 has several (in this case four) duplex printing mechanisms 03 arranged vertically above one another for both-sides printing in offset-against-offset-operation. The duplex printing mechanisms 03 - shown here in the form of bridges or n-printing mechanisms - are respectively formed by two printing mechanisms 04, each of which has cylinders 06; 07, one designed as transmission cylinder 06 and one as stereo cylinder 07, e. g. printing mechanism cylinders 06; 07, as well as each having an inking unit 08 and in case of wet offset printing additionally a damping device 09. Between both the transmission cylinders 06, in the setting position a (duplex-) printing point 05 is formed. The mentioned components are designated only on the upper most duplex printing mechanism 03 of Fig. 1, where the (duplex-) printing mechanisms 03; 04 arranged above one another are however designed largely identical - especially in the development of the features relevant for the invention. The duplex printing mechanisms 03 - without the advantageous feature of linear arrangement described below - can, contrary to the depiction in Fig. 1, be just as well designed as a U-unit opening upwards.<br><br>
In advantageous designs the printing unit 01 has depending - on the requirement, machine type, applied technology and/or extension stage - one or more of the following features. The printing unit 01 or the duplex printing mechanism 03 is/are designed centric, i.e. in the region of the duplex printing positions 05 and dividable operation-wise and/or the printing mechanisms 08 (and if required damping devices 09) are designed as modules already having several rollers and mountable as preassembled modules in the printing unit 01 and/or printing cylinders 06; 07 having different diameters without any requirement of bearing holes in the side frame can be mounted, and/or the cylinder bearings can be set force-regulated in linear bearings, and/or the rotation axes of the printing cylinders 06; 07 in print-on position are designed lying largely on a common plane. Additionally, (or if required as independent design) the modularity can be advantageously supported by means of the drive joint of a printing cylinder pair coupled pair-wise through two intermediate gears, or even through individual drives of the cylinder 06; 07. This similarly holds good in the design for mechanical independence of the drive of the inking unit 08 and, if required, damping device 09 from the drives of the printing cylinder 06; 07.<br>
In principle, individual or multiple features mentioned should be taken as advantageous for printing units that do not have printing mechanisms 03 designed as duplex printing units in offset-against-offset printing, but merely have printing mechanisms 03 working in first form/blank paper. The transmission cylinder 06 of a printing mechanism then works along with an offset cylinder. Especially in the modular concept, this can be foreseen as desired, whereby instead of both the cylinders 06; 07 of the second printing mechanism 04 and the inking unit 08, then only an offset cylinder is used. For the arrangement within the side walls whatever is given below for the other cylinders 06; 07, can be applicable.<br>
In the following figures 2 and 3 and advantageous design of the printing unit 04 is shown where it is designed dividable operation-defined in the region of its duplex printing points 05, i.e. for direction and maintenance purposes (contrary to dismantling or disassembling) - basically independent of the modular structure of the printing mechanisms 04 as shown<br><br>
and described below and/or the bearing units 14 (see Fig. 18) merely indicated as example for the above duplex printing mechanism 03. both the parts separable from one another (including cylinder 06; 07, printing mechanisms 08 and if present, damping devices 09) are referred to below as part printing units 01.1 and 01.2.<br>
For this, the printing cylinders 06; 07 of the several (four) duplex printing mechanisms 03 arranged above one another are mounted rotate-able in or against a right and a left frame section or wall section 11; 12 in such a way, that both printing cylinders 06; 07 of the same printing mechanism 04 are allocated to the same frame section or wall section 11; 12. Ideally, the printing cylinders 06; 07 of several printing mechanism, especially all those printing the web 02 on the same side, are mounted on the same frame section or wall section 11; 12. In principle, the printing cylinders 06; 07 can be mounted only on one side, i.e. flying on only one front-side frame section 11. However, for each part printing unit 01.1; 01.2 two frame sections 11; 12 are foreseen, which are arranged front-sided to the cylinders 06; 07. Both parts separable from one another are referred to below as part printing units 01.1 and 01.2 that have the respective frame sections 11; 12 and printing mechanisms 04 (printing cylinders 06: 07 and inking units 08).<br>
The part printing units 01.1; 01.2 are movable towards one another or away from one another along a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the cylinders 06; 07 in that one of the two is mounted space-bound (here part printing unit 01.1), i.e. for example on the flow 13 of the printing press room, on a space-bound beam 13, on a mounting plate 13 or on a mounting frame 13 fixed for the printing unit 01; and the other one (here part printing unit 01.2) is mounted movable against the floor 13 or beam 13 or mounting plate 13 or mounting frame 13 (referred to below as beam 13).<br>
For this, the outer frame sections 12 are supported in bearing elements (not shown) and the beam 13 corresponding to one another, e.g. jointly forming a linear channel. These can be designed as rollers running in rails or even as sliding body-bearing or roller body-bearing linear guide elements allocated to one another.` `` ,<br><br>
9<br>
The wall sections 11; 2 are designed in such a way that in their operating position A (Fig. 2) they are designed largely form-complimentary to one another on their side towards one another, and driven together on their separating lines or impact lines they nevertheless form a closed side front.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a servicing position B of the printing unit 01 (without the bearing units 14 indicated in Fig.2), whereby the relative position of the part printing units 01.1; 01.2 is effected by moving the frame sections 12. The relative position can basically also be achieved in another design, in that both part printing units 01.1; 01.2 or their frame sections 11; 12 are mounted in a movable manner.<br>
The forming and transmission cylinders 07; 06 are designed in a first format development hitherto shown in Fig. 1 to 3 preferably with a bale width of at least four, e.g. four or for particularly high product discharge even six print pages arranged beside one another in newspaper format, especially in broadsheet format. Thus a double width web 02 can be printed alongside a four times or three times wide web 02 along with six newspaper pages, and the forming cylinder 07 can accordingly be loaded with four or six printing forms beside one another with their ends aligned to one another. In a first advantageous format development hitherto not shown in Fig. 1 to 3, the cylinders 06; 07 have a circumference that largely conforms to two print pages in a newspaper format arranged one after the other.<br>
In the designs of the printing unit 01 with forming cylinders 07 having double formats (two newspaper pages in the circumference one after the other), it has two channels staggered to one another in circumference direction by 180 for taking up the print forms that are preferable designed continuously over the entire effective bale length. The forming cylinder 07 can then be fitted with four or six print forms beside one another and respectively,two print forms behind one another.<br>
The transmission cylinder 06 in case of double format (two newspaper pages in the circumference behind one another) in one design has, for example, only one channel for<br><br>
10<br>
taking up one or more print blankets arranged beside one another that are designed continuous over the entire bale length. The transmission cylinder 06 can then be fitted with one print blanket going right through over the bale length and over almost the entire circumference, or with two or three print blankets beside one another reaching over almost the entire circumference. In another design of the double-size transmission cylinder 06, it can have two or three print blankets beside one another whereby the ones respectively adjacent to one another are staggered by 180` in circumference direction. These print blankets staggered to one another can be held in two or three channel sections, which again are similarly beside one another in longitudinal direction of the cylinder 06; however the adjacent channel sections are staggered with respect to one another by 180` in circumference direction.<br>
As already indicated in Fig 2 and 3, in an advantageous design of the printing unit 01 -initially on principle independent of the divisibility or separate-ability - the inking units 08 or the cylinder units 17 formed out of the bearing units 14 and the concerned cylinder 06, or preferably the inking units 08 as well as the cylinder units 17 are designed as modules, i.e. pre-mounted structurally siand-alone component units.<br><br>
