<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
THE PREPARATION AND THE USE OF ETHOXY COMBRETASTATINS AND THEIR PRODRUGS<br>
<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the field of pharmaceutical synthesis, especially to the synthesis of anti-cancer medicament.<br>
<br>
Background arts<br>
Combretaceae, a family of shrubs and trees found in tropical or subtropical areas, is well represented in traditional medical practices. Twenty-five species in Combretum, which is a genus in Combretaceae, are known to be used for treating Hansen's disease and cancers in Africa and India. However, only a few of them, such as Combretum micrantbum and Combretum zeyberi, have been studied. Combretum caffrum, a species of Combretum, is called Mdulu in South Africa by the Zulus, while is also known as Bushveld willow, Bushwill, or Rooiblaar elsewhere. At the end of 1970s, after widespread screening, National Cancer Institute found that the Combretum genus plants can strongly inhibit the P388 lymphocytic leukemial cell. Since the beginning of 1980s, a wide interest in studying this kind of plant has been caused. During this period, Dr. G. Robert Pettit, the director of Cancer Research Institute of Arizona State University, and his four colleagues isolated combretastatins from the African willow tree Combretum caffrum which has been used by the Zulus as herbal remedies and as paint for spears. In the Journal of Canadian Chemistry, Dr. George R. Pettit stated that the bark of the tree had anti-tumor activity. Afterward, not only many compounds having high activity are isolated and identified, but also the research on their pharmacological mechanism and modifications of their structures have been developed. (Pettit, G.R.; et al. 1) Can. J. Chem. 1987, 65, 2390-2396. 2) J. Nat. Prod. 1987, 50, 119-131. 3) Experieutia 1989, 45, 209-211.) Combretastatins are a series of compounds characterized by the structure of Z-1, 2-diphenyl ethylene. Among those compounds, Combretastatin A-4 [CA-4, Combretastatin, (Z)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-2-(3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy)phenylethylene] proves to be exceptionally strong inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, and is represented by formula XVII (Pettit, G. R., et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1666-1672).<br>
 <br>
Recently, CA-4 shows exciting property in shutting down tumor vasculature as a tumor vascular targeting agent. (Thorpe, P. E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, Jan 15, 10(2), 415-427. West, C. M. Price, P. Anticancer Drugs. 2004, Mar, 15(3), 179-187. Young, S. L.; Chaplin, D. J. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004, Sep, 13(9), 1171-1182.) CA-4 developed by Oxigene Inc., USA as a new anticancer drug has entered phase III clinical trial. In 1997, T. Hatanaka, et al. in Ajinomoto Co., Japan discovered that if the 3’- hydroxyl of CA-4 was replaced by amino group and then modified as amino amide , the anticancer activity of the obtained water-soluble prodrug could be greatly improved while with much less toxicity compared to CA-4 (USP5674906). At present, 3’-amino CA-4 amino amide (AVE8062) developed by Aventis Pharma Co., France has entered phase II clinical trial.<br>
Therefore, looking for new combretastatins with higher activity is an exigent task in this field.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Through extensive and intensive study, the inventors unexpectedly discovered that the 4’ position of B-ring of the nature product Combretastatin is an active site, and that the original methoxy group at the 4’ position of B-ring of Combretastatin can be replaced by an ethoxy group to improve the targeting activity of tumor vascular.<br>
The above mentioned nature product Combretastatin was successfully introduced an ethoxy group in the 4’ position of B aromatic ring by means of the key reaction of demethylation using lithium diphenylphosphine selectively. <br>
Meanwhile, 254nm ultraviolet photocatalysis was used in synthesizing those compounds via Wittig reaction, which improved stereoselectivity of the reaction, thus making the yield of products in Z configuration increase substantially.<br>
These new compounds possess enhanced ability of tubulin polymerization inhibition, which can be used for treating tumor and a pathological state caused by abnormal angiogenesis.<br>
<br>
Compounds<br>
The present invention provided new derivatives of Combretastatin in which 4’ position of B aromatic ring was introduced an ethoxy group while 3’ position mainly was a hydroxyl group with its derived phosphate or inner salt of phosphorylcholine and an amino group with its derived amino amide water-soluble prodrugs, represented by Formula I<br>
<br>
 <br>
Wherein, <br>
R is hydroxyl, amino, nitro, halogen, alkoxy, phosphate, inner salt of phosphorylcholine, side chain of an amino acid, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
When R is selected as phosphate, inner salt of phosphorylcholine, side chain of an amino acid, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its water-soluble prodrugs are formed.<br>
When R is hydroxyl, water-soluble prodrugs, phosphate or inner salt of phosphorylcholine, are derived.<br>
When R is amino, water-soluble prodrugs, -NH(COCHR′NH)n-H (in which R′ is a side chain of a natural amino acid) are derived.<br>
Preferably, ethoxy combretastatin has priority when R is hydroxyl; 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin has priority when R is amino. The structure is represented by formula I, wherein R=-OH, -NH2, -OP(O)(ONa)2, -OP(O)(O-)(OCH2CH2NMe3), -NH(COCHR′NH)m-H (wherein R′ is hydrogen, side chain of a natural amino acid, phenyl; m is an integer of 1 to 3).<br>
The ethoxy combretastatins of the present invention can form pharmaceutically acceptable base-addition salts with inorganic bases or organic bases. The mentioned inorganic bases include but not limited to potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide, while the mentioned organic bases include, but not limited to, aliphatic amines (such as triethylamine), hydroxylamine (such as ethanol amine), amino acids (such as histidine), amino glycosides (such as neoamine).<br>
The ethoxy combretastatins of the present invention can form pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts with inorganic acids or organic acids. The mentioned inorganic acids include but not limited to hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, while the mentioned organic acids include, but not limited to, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid and glutamic acid.<br>
<br>
Preparations of compounds<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I comprising the following steps: <br>
With the presence of the phase transfer catalyst, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde was ethylated and selectively demethylated into a series of novel p-ethoxybenzaldehyde derivatives by using lithium diphenylphosphine. The above compounds of p-ethoxybenzaldehyde derivatives then underwent Wittig reaction as raw materials with high stereoselectivity, thus giving a series of ethoxy combretastatins derivatives, followed by phosphatization, or combining with amino acids etc. to obtain a series of water-soluble prodrugs of ethoxy combretastatin.<br>
<br>
Synthesis of p-ethoxybenzaldehyde derivatives<br>
4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde III or 4-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde X was prepared by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) II or 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde IX using ethyl bromide in the presence of inorganic base and phase transfer catalyst.<br>
 <br>
The above mentioned inorganic bases were selected from the group consisting of: hydroxide, one or more of carbonates, preferably from the group consisting of potassium hydroxide and/or potassium carbonate. The mentioned phase transfer catalyst were selected from the group consisting of quarternary ammonium salts, quarternary phosphonium salts, crown ether, polyethyleneglycol (PEG), preferably from the group consisting of benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride, tetrabutyl ammonium bisulphate (TBAB), 18-crown-6, diphenyl-18-crown-6, dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 ethers or PEG-400.<br>
The formyl group of 4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde III was protected by using glycol compounds, and then the 3-position methoxy was selectively demethylated with lithium diphenylphosphine to obtain 4-ethoxy-3-hydroxybenzaldehyde IV.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Synthesis of ethoxy combretastatin<br>
In the presence of organic base catalyst, 4-ethoxy-3-hydroxybenzaldehyde IV was reacted with triphenylmethyl chloride to obtain 3-triphenymethoxy-4-ethoxybenzaldehyde. 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyltriphenyl phosphine bromide was converted into corresponding phosphonium ylide with n-butyl lithium, and then the corresponding phosphonium ylide was reacted with the above 3-triphenymethoxy-4-ethoxybenzaldehyde via Wittig reaction to form the cis-stilbene derivatives with high efficiency. Subsequently, the trityl group was deprotected with the combination action of concentrated hydrochloric acid and trifluoroacetic acid to obtain ethoxy combretastatin VI.<br>
 <br>
The above mentioned inorganic bases were selected from the group consisting of triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine.<br>
<br>
Synthesis of 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin<br>
Catalyzed by 254nm ultraviolet light, 4-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzaldehyde X was reacted with above mentioned phosphonium ylide via Wittig reaction to obtain (Z)-3’-nitro ethoxy combretastatin XI with high selectivity. Then the 3’-nitro was reduced to amino group by reducing agents. Among the reducing agents, stannous chloride, Zinc powder/acetic acid, sodium thiosulfate, nickel chloride/sodium borohydride were preferred. Thus, 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin XII was obtained.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Synthesis of ethoxy combretastatin phosphate<br>
As shown in figure 1, the 3’-position hydroxyl of above ethoxy combretastatin VI was converted to phosphate disodium salt by reacting with carbon tetrachloride, diisopropylethylamine, dibenzyl phosphite, trimethylsilane bromide, sodium methoxide, thus obtaining ethoxy combretastatin phosphate VII.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Synthesis of ethoxy combretastatin phosphorylcholine<br>
Alternatively, also shown in figure 1, the 3’-position hydroxyl of above ethoxy combretastatin VI was converted to cyclic phosphate derivative of ethoxy combretastatin by reacting with 2-chloro-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, a kind of phosphoryl reagent. With the presence of trimethylamine, the ring of the cyclic phosphate derivative opened to give inner salt of ethoxy combretastatin phosphorylcholine VIII.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Synthesis of 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin amino amide <br>
As shown in figure 2, 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin XII was treated with N-α-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acid derivative (FmocAA) and BOP reagent, or cyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) to introduce an amino acid side chain at the 3’-amino group, as represented by XIII and XIV. Subsequently, the product having an amino acid side chain at the 3’-position was deprotected with sodium hydroxide and turned to amino amide to obtain a series of 3’-amino ethoxy combretastatin amino amide derivatives, as represented by XV and XVI.<br>
 <br>
<br>

The obtained crude product was then purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel column, 2:1 n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 5.1g white foamy substance in a yield of 61%. 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500M) δ: 9.73 (1H, brs; -NH); 7.73 (2H, m; Fmoc); 7.56 (2H, d; J=6.2Hz; Fmoc); 7.35 (2H, m; Fmoc); 7.22 (2H, m; Fmoc); 7.05(1H, d; 2'-H); 6.91 (1H, dd; 6'-H ); 6.74 (1H, d; 5'-H); 6.60 (2H, s; 2,6-H ); 6.51 (1H, d; J=12.2Hz; 1a-H ); 6.43 (1H, d; J=12.2Hz; 1a'-H); 5.82 (1H, brs; Ser-NH); 4.63 (1H, brs; Ser-OH); 4.38 (2H, d; J=7.0Hz; Fmoc); 4.22 (1H, t; J=7.0Hz; Fmoc); 4.18 (2H, q; -CH2); 3.91 (1H, m; Ser-CH); 3.85 (3H, s; 4-OCH3); 3.71 (6H, s; 3,5-OCH3); 2.66 (2H, m; Ser-CH2); 1.56 (3H, t; -CH3). MS (m/Z): 638 (M+). High resolution mass spectrometry: calcd 638.26, found 638.27.<br>
Step 2: 1.9g above (Z)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-2-(3’-amino-4’-ethoxy) phenylethylene Fmoc-serinamide (3.0mmol) was dissolved in mixed solvents consisting of 20ml methanol and 20ml dichloromethane. To the solution was added 3.4 ml 2N sodium hydroxide solution, and reacted for 24 hours at room temperature under stirring. The reaction was monitored with TLC. After the reaction completed, it was cooled and well-mixed with 20ml saturated sodium chloride solution. Then the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (50 ml × 3), and the organic layer was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and condensed under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was then purified by normal pressure column chromatography (silica gel column, 9:1 dichloromethane/methanol) to obtain 0.62g colorless foamy substance in a yield of 50%. 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500M) δ: 9.75 (1H, brs; -NH); 7.08(1H, d; 2'-H); 6.94 (1H, dd; 6'-H ); 6.75 (1H, d; 5'-H); 6.63 (2H, s; 2,6-H ); 6.53 (1H, d; J=12.2Hz; 1a-H ); 6.45 (1H, d; J=12.2Hz; 1a'-H); 5.51-4.72 (2H, br; Ser-NH2); 4.52 (1H, brs; Ser-OH); 4.19 (2H, q; -CH2); 3.92 (1H, m; Ser-CH); 3.86 (3H, s; 4-OCH3); 3.72 (6H, s; 3,5-OCH3); 2.68 (2H, m; Ser-CH2); 1.57 (3H, t; -CH3).

Example 10<br>
In vitro anti-tumor activity evaluation<br>
The tumor cell cultured in vitro was treated with ethoxy combretastatin derivatives for 72 hours, and the MTT and SRB assays was used to evaluate its inhibition of tumor proliferation. The comparative result with CA-4 was shown in Table 2. <br>
Cell Line: H460 (human lung cancer cell), SGC7901 (human stomach cancer cell), HT-29 (human colon cancer cell), Bel-7402 (human liver cancer cell).<br>
Experimental Design: The cells were incubated with the compounds in various concentrations (100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 µM) for 72 hours. SRB assay was used to evaluate the inhibition effect of the compounds on cell proliferation. The inhibition rate was calculated, and IC50 was calculated by using Logit model as a function of the inhibition rate. And the anti-tumor activity of the compounds in vitro was compared. <br>
The inhibition rate was expressed using the following equation: <br>
Inhibition rate (%)=［(average OD value of control group－average OD value of experimental group)/average OD value of control group］×100%.<br>

Materials were weighed exactly according to the formulas (Table 4). Formula amount of mannitol was dissolved in 80% of the total formula amount of injection water to give a clarity solution, and 0.1% (g/ml) injection active carbon was added. The mixture was stirred until uniformity, settled for about 10 min, and filtered through 0.45 µm micropore membrane. The rest amount of the injection water was added. The solution was filtered again through 0.22µm micropore membrane. pH value and content were measured to give the qualified product. And then, a quantity of the solution was filled into bottles and was freeze dried. The bottles were filled with nitrogen and then cap-covered and labeled. They were packaged into boxes, and proof-tested to give finished product (because the derivatives of Combretastatin were moderately sensitive to temperature and light, so the whole operation processes were done in dark condition).<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
<br>
“THE PREPARATION AND THE USE OF ETHOXY COMBRETASTATINS <br>
AND THEIR PRODRUGS”<br>
<br>
The invention disclosed a total synthesis process of novel ethoxy combretastatins and their prodrugs. Combretastatins are chemically modified by ethoxy substituted on the 4’-position of their B aryl ring and are converted to be their soluble prodrugs of phosphate or their inner salt of phosphorylcholine by modifying the hydroxyl on the 3’-position of their B aryl ring. Similarly, 3’-amino combretastatin is 4’-ethoxy chemically modified and further side chain of amino acid can be introduced to the amino to form soluble prodrug of amino acidamide. The structure of the said compound is showed as formula (I). Ethoxy combretastatins possess potent tubulin polymerization inhibitory activity and can be used for the treatment of inhibiting tumor or neovascular.</td>
