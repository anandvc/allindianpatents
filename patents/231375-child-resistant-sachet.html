				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to child resistant sachets for medicinal products, of the type<br>
wherein the sachet is ordinarily resistant to tearing but a notch is provided which, when<br>
the sachet if folded across the notch, reveals a cut edge for initiating a tear, thus allowing<br>
the sachet contents to be dispensed.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Medicinal products can be harmful if taken in excess amount or by someone other than<br>
the intended recipient, especially small children. Accordingly it is customary to provide<br>
packages for certain products which cannot readily be opened by children but which<br>
nevertheless contain features allowing an adult to open the package once it is manipulated<br>
in a special way. This invention relates to a three seal sachet, commonly also known as a<br>
stick pack, which has a longitudinal seal and two transverse seals. Such three seal sachets<br>
are frequently used for food items but do not typically come with child resistant features.<br>
A tear notch may be provided in such sachets but it is usually located in an obvious<br>
position at the edge of the sachet such that the method of opening is either obvious or the<br>
package can be opened inadvertently.<br>
PCT application WO 95/01921 describes a stick pack for liquid drags, but it too provides<br>
a notch on the edge of the pack which provides insufficient challenge to opening by a<br>
young child.<br>
US patents 5,222,813 and US 5,371,997 describe packaging bags with a longitudinal fin<br>
seal and tear-open slits which extend through the fin seal but, like WO 95/01921, only<br>
disclose a notch starting on the edge of the pack and therefore with insufficient child<br>
resistance.<br><br>
US patents 5,511,665 and US 5,472,093 concert packages suitable for pharmaceuticals<br>
incorporating 'hidden notches' which only revealla tear slit after a particular fold is made,<br>
thus making the method of opening much more difficult for a small child to discern but<br>
nevertheless allowing opening by an adult able to follow instructions.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the child resistance of stick or three seal<br>
packs or sachets which have advantages in the dispensing of liquids and powders. It is a<br>
further object of the present invention to provide three seal packs or sachets which have<br>
improved resistance to flavour loss and thus to make them more suitable for medicinal<br>
products where it is important to have a flavour to mask the bitter taste of many medicinal<br>
active agents.<br>
These and other objectives will become readily apparent from the detailed description that<br>
follows.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a three seal sachet for a medicinal product<br>
comprising:<br>
a)	a laminate sheet comprising opposed first land second longitudinal sheet edges and<br>
opposed first and second sheet faces; wherein<br>
i) the laminate sheet is folded to form first and second opposed longitudinal<br>
sachet edges and opposed first and second sachet faces; and<br>
ii) the laminate sheet is sealed to itself along marginal portions of the first and<br>
second longitudinal sheet edges on the first sheet face, thereby forming a<br>
flattened tube with a fin seal on the first sachet face, the fin seal being folded<br>
against the first sachet face;<br>
b)	first and second transverse seals bonding together the laminate sheet along marginal<br>
portions of first and second transverse edges of the sheet on the first sheet face,<br>
thereby closing the tube at each end;<br><br>
c)	a fold line (BB') extending from the first transverse edge of the sheet, through the<br>
first transverse seal and the fin seal, to the first sachet longitudinal edge; and<br>
d)	a notch passing through the first transverse seal and the fin seal and intersecting the<br>
fold line, such that when the sachet is folded along the fold line a cut edge is<br>
revealed for tearing open the sachet.<br>
This sachet design disclosed herein provides improved child resistance in a package form<br>
which has advantages in dispensing of the product since, with a fin seal along one face of<br>
a pack it has been found that the package holds a better three dimensional shape and<br>
provides easier pouring than a flat sachet with seals along all four sides.<br>
The length and location of the fold line, and the location of the notch are important in<br>
ensuring that the package can be opened without difficulty when manipulated in the<br>
intended manner and that a sufficiently large pouring spout is obtained through which the<br>
product can be completely dispensed.<br>
In a second but related aspect the invention further relates to sachets of similar form<br>
wherein the inside layer of the sachet laminate is an acrylonitrile methyl acrylate<br>
copolymer resin which provides improved flavour barrier properties without<br>
compromising on the tear characteristics of the sachet. In this second aspect, which is<br>
especially useful when the sachet is intended for medicinal products comprising bitter<br>
tasting active agents, such as dextromethorphan, and when flavouring and flavour<br>
retention is essential in order to make the medicinal product palatable, it is less important<br>
where the longitudinal fin seal is located and it can be on a longitudinal edge of the<br>
sachet.<br>
Preferably both aspects of the invention are combined in order to maximise user<br>
acceptance of the package and provide improved patient compliance.<br>

Description of preferred embodiments<br>
The present invention is now described in detail by way of an embodiment thereof with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The three seal sachet 10, illustrated in Figs: 1, 2 and 3, essentially comprises a<br>
longitudinally folded packaging wrapper having a longitudinal seal 40 to turn it into a<br>
tube and transverse seals 60 and 70 at first 25 and second 35 transverse edges of the sheet<br>
to close the tube and form a hermetically sealed inner volume capable of containing and<br>
protecting a medicinal product until the sachet is opened. In the first aspect of the<br>
invention the longitudinal seal is a fin seal 40, that is, the longitudinal edges of the sachet<br>
are merely folds and the longitudinal seal is located on the first face 50 of the sachet. In<br><br>
the second aspect of the invention the longitudinal seal may be a fin seal as described<br>
above, but it is alternately possible for the longitudinal seal to be along one longitudinal<br>
edge of the sachet, the longitudinal edge of the sachet being a fold.<br>
At the seals the first face of the laminate sheet is bonded to itself along marginal portions<br>
of the sachet edges. Heat sealing is preferred. The bonded marginal portions generally<br>
have a width of from about 3 mm to 5 mm for the longitudinal seal and from about 3 mm<br>
to about 12 mm for the transverse seals. In a preferred aspect, the first transverse seal has<br>
an enlarged area 65 extending longitudinally along the first longitudinal sachet edge. This<br>
is to assist in the formation of a fold line BB' which does not compromise the pack<br>
integrity. This enlarged area may extend up to 20 mm or more along the first longitudinal<br>
sachet edge 20. In the embodiment shown the fold line BB' extends into said enlarged<br>
area 65.<br>
Preferred dimensions of the sachet are to have a length of from about 5 cm to about 15<br>
cm, more preferably from about 6 cm to about 10 cm. along its longitudinal edges and to<br><br>
have a width of from about 10 mm to about 25 mm, more preferably from about 12 mm to<br>
about 18 mm, along its transverse seals. The sachet will generally contain from about 0.5<br>
to about 5ml of product, more preferably from about 0.5 ml to about 2 ml. If the sachet is<br><br>
much wider than about 25 mm then it becomes more difficult to squeeze the entire dose<br>
out of the package, leading to undesirable underdosing of the medicinal product.<br>
A fin seal herein will generally be folded against the sachet face on which it is formed, the<br>
direction of folding is not especially important, though in preferred embodiments it is<br>
folded such that the laminate sheet edges are directed away from the first longitudinal<br>
sachet edge.<br>
The sachet comprises a fold line BB' extending from the first transverse edge 25 of the<br>
sheet, through the first transverse seal 60 and the fin seal 40, in at least the first aspect of<br>
the invention, to the first sachet longitudinal edge 20. The fold line may be no more than<br>
a printed indication on the pack to inform the user where to make a fold. In preferred<br>
embodiments the sachet comprises mechanical means to assist folding along the fold line.<br>
Such mechanical means may comprise a crease or an unsealed area extending along the<br>
fold line. Clearly the unsealed area should not be of such excessive width that the sachet<br>
integrity is compromised. The mechanical means may alternately be a change in the<br>
knurling pattern applied by the clamping jaws typically used to effect a seal.<br>
The sachet further comprises notch 80 passing through the first transverse seal 60 and, at<br>
least in the first aspect of the invention, also through the fin seal 40 and intersecting the<br>
fold line BB', such that when the sachet is folded along the fold line a cut edge is revealed<br>
for tearing open the sachet. If the sachet has a fin seal and the notch does not pass<br>
through it then the fin seal may interfere with the propagation of the tear required to open<br>
the sachet. The notch 80 is located entirely within the sealed area so as to ensure that the<br>
hermetic seal of the package is not endangered. Preferably a spacing between said notch<br>
80 and said inner volume of the sachet is at least about 2 mm, more preferably at least<br>
about 3 mm. The notch aids in initiating the tearing of sachet, once folded to create a<br>
pouring spout 90.<br><br>
Notch 80 intersects fold line BB'. The angle of intersection can be any angle provide<br>
there is sufficient notch either side of the line to; initiate a tear once the sachet is folded.<br>
The notch preferably extends perpendicularly to the fold line.<br>
The fold line BB' preferably has a length of at least about 8 mm, more preferably at least<br>
about 10 mm and yet more preferably at least about 12 mm. This is to enable the<br>
insertion of notch 80 intersecting the fold line and sufficient space to each side of the<br>
notch for a user to grip the folded sachet. Suitably said notch is at a distance of at least 4<br>
mm, preferably at least 5 mm from each end of the fold line.<br>
In order that the user, on tearing the sachet can create a sufficiently large pouring spout<br><br>
90, the notch 80 is preferably at a distance of at least about 4 mm from the second sachet<br>
longitudinal edge, the distance being measured perpendicularly to said edge.<br>
The sleeve of the three seal sachet according to FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 may be made with<br><br>
the same process as the sleeve according to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3. Such a process may<br>
comprise these steps: a wrapper sheet is pulled over a shaping device whereby the sheet is<br>
longitudinally bent to form a sleeve and then two adjoining longitudinal sheet edges are<br>
bonded to one another with a longitudinal seal. Thereafter, the tubular member formed<br>
in such a manner is advanced and is, at predetermined locations, pinched together and is<br>
further provided with a transverse seal and with a tear-open slit. Then the leading sachet<br><br>
is severed by a cutting device in such a manner that the trailing sachet opening is guided<br>
underneath a product dispensing device which charges the sachet with the product<br>
whereupon the open side through which the filling has taken place is closed with a second<br>
transverse seal. It is further feasible to provide later a second tear-open slit in the second<br>
transverse seal.<br>
It is an advantage of the three seal sachet according to the invention that the tear-open slit<br>
applied according to the invention avoids the use of additional materials and ensures a<br><br>
user friendly tear-open aid for sachets having longitudinal and transverse seals having a<br>
plurality of bonded layers. "User friendly" in this connection means that even wrapper<br>
sheets which can be torn manually only with difficulty such as those made of polyester,<br>
polypropylene or oriented polypropylene, may be readily torn with the application of only<br><br>
a slight manual force and further, the obtained open cross section is large. When the tear-<br>
open slit according to the invention is used, the sachet may be torn open over 50% of its<br>
width. This is of particular importance in relatively narrow elongated sachets which have<br>
a length-to-width ratio of, for example, 5:1 or even in normal sachets which contain only<br>
poorly pourable material such as powdered soup.<br>
The medicinal product for which the sachet herein is intended is preferably a liquid. The<br>
medicinal product will generally include an active agent that falls into at least one of the<br>
following pharmacological classifications: antitussives; antihistamines; non-sedating<br>
antihistamines; decongestants; expectorants; mucolytics, analgesic, antipyretic<br>
antiinflammatory agents, local anesthetics and mixtures thereof. The invention herein,<br>
especially in its second aspect, is particularly useful when the active agent is a bitter<br>
tasting one and the product further comprises at least about 0.5%, more preferably at least<br>
about 0.8% by weight of flavouring agents. The term 'flavouring agent' as used herein<br>
means a volatile material having a molecular weight of at least 65 added to improve the<br>
taste of the medicinal product. Suitable flavouring agents include anise, oil of<br>
peppermint, oil of clove, eucalyptus, lemon, lime, honey lemon, red fruit, grapefruit,<br>
orange and , cherry oils and essences as well as cooling agents and warming agents such<br>
as carboxamides, menthols, thymol, camphor, capsicum, phenol, eucalyptus oil, benzyl<br>
alcohol, salicyl alcohol, ethanol, clove bud oil, and hexylresorcinol, ketals, diols, and<br>
mixtures thereof. In preferred embodiments the medicinal product is a treatment for<br>
coughs or colds comprising an active agent selected from dextromethorphan,<br>
guaiaphenesin, and pseudoephedrine, more preferably the active agent is<br>
dextromethorphan, especially in its free base form. Exemplary medicinal products, are<br>
disclosed in PCT applications WO 00/41692 and WO 00/41694, both incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entirety.<br>
The materials used to construct the laminate sheet can be any that are customary in the art,<br>
such as polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate (PET),<br>
provided that the sachet is sufficiently tear resistant until correctly manipulated. In<br>
preferred embodiments the laminate comprises a layer of aluminium foil. In highly<br><br>
preferred embodiments the laminate comprises a layer of acrylonitrile methyl acrylate<br>
copolymer resin on the first laminate sheet face, which will form the inside of the sachet<br>
once constructed. This is the layer that will be bonded to itself at the seals. Although<br>
acrylonitrile methyl acrylate copolymer resin is more difficult to bond than more<br>
commonly used materials it is preferred for its improved flavour barrier properties.<br><br>
Acrylonitrile methyl acrylate copolymer resin is commercially available from BP<br>
Chemicals as Barex®. Preferably the laminate comprises a layer of a third material on the<br>
second laminate sheet face. In the embodiment shown the laminate comprises a first sheet<br>
face of Barex® grade 210 and a second sheet face of PET, sandwiching a layer of<br>
aluminium foil. The Barex®, PET and aluminium layers have approximate thicknesses of<br>
12.5, 23 and 8.8 μm respectively.<br>
Since the invention disclosed herein may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
departing from the general characteristics, the embodiment described herein is, therefore,<br>
to be considered in all respects as merely illustrative, the scope of the invention being<br>
indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description; and all<br>
embodiments which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are<br>
