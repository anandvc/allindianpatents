				<td>SENSOR FOR HERMETIC MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a sensor for a hermetic compressor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a sensor which is designed to be welded to the hermetic shell of the Hermetic compressor.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The utilization of hermetically sealed motor-compressor units has become increasingly prevalent in recent years in refrigeration applications wherein the motor-compressor units are employed to compress refrigerant vapor. The compressor is generally driven by an electric motor which rotates the crankshaft or driveshaft of the compressor at relatively high speeds. These hermetically sealed compressors are designed to run trouble free for the life of the motor-compressor unit.<br>
[0003] While these hermetically sealed compressors typically do not experience any problems during their lifetime, it may be advantageous to monitor various refrigerant pressures within the refrigeration system for improved control, protection and for trouble shooting of diagnostics of both the system and the compressor should a problem occur. In an increasing number of air-conditioning or refrigeration systems, monitoring of the pressure of the refrigerant at one or several locations in the refrigeration circuit is a requirement. The pressures that are typically monitored include the suction pressure and the discharge pressure<br>
1<br><br>
that is seen at the compressor. These pressures are traditionally sensed using a pressure sensor that is threaded into a fitting located in the suction and/or discharge refrigerant lines adjacent to the compressor. These pressure sensors are relatively expensive and unless it is essential to the proper functioning of the refrigeration system, the sensors are not installed due to financial considerations.<br>
[0004] Assuming that a relatively inexpensive pressure sensor were made available to the refrigeration industry, most of the refrigeration systems currently being built could be improved by the incorporation of the pressure sensors. The pressure sensors could be utilized for improved control, protection and in trouble shooting of diagnostics of both the system and the compressor itself on virtually all of the refrigerant systems rather than on a limited number of systems.<br>
[0005] The present invention provides the art with a weld-on pressure sensor for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressors. The weld-on pressure sensor is a low cost component which is easily and inexpensively welded to the shell of the compressor. The weld-on pressure sensor can be an oil filled pressure sensor, a dry type pressure sensor or a dry type pressure sensor where the shell forms the diaphragm for the pressure sensor. The weld-on pressure sensor of the present invention allows the electronics that are part of the sensing device to be placed external to the shell of the compressor and only the sensing mechanism is placed inside the hermetic shell.<br>
2<br><br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

[0010] Figure 3 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a pressure sensor in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[0011] Figure 4 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a pressure sensor in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
3<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012]      The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a scroll compressor which incorporates the pressure sensor in accordance with the present invention which is designated generally by reference numeral 10. Compressor 10 comprises a generally cylindrical hermetic shell 12 having welded at the upper end thereof a cap 14 and at the lower end thereof a base 16 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally formed therewith. Cap 14 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 18 which may have the usual discharge valve therein (not shown). Other major elements affixed to the shell include a transversely extending partition 22 which is welded about its periphery at the same point that cap 14 is welded to shell 12, a main bearing housing 24 which is suitably secured to shell 12, a lower bearing housing 26 also having a plurality of radially outwardly extending legs each of which is also suitably secured to shell 12 and a pressure sensor 28 welded to shell 12 and a pressure sensor 28 welded to cap 14. A motor stator 30 which is generally square in cross-section but with the corners rounded off is press fitted into shell 12. The flats between the rounded corners on the stator provide passageways between the stator and shell, which facilitate the return flow of lubricant from the top of the shell to the bottom.<br>
4<br><br>
[0014] A drive shaft or crankshaft 32 having an eccentric crank pin 34 at the upper end thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 36 in main bearing housing 24 and a second bearing 38 in lower bearing housing 26. Crankshaft 32 has at the lower end a relatively large diameter concentric bore 40 which communicates with a radially outwardly inclined smaller diameter bore 42 extending upwardly therefrom to the top of crankshaft 32. Disposed within bore 40 is a stirrer44. The lower portion of the interior shell 12 defines suction chamber 46 which is partially filled with lubricating oil to a level slightly above the lower end of a rotor 48, and bore 40 acts as a pump to pump lubricating fluid up the crankshaft 32 and into passageway 42 and ultimately to all of the various portions of the compressor which require lubrication.<br>
[0015] Crankshaft 32 is rotatively driven by an electric motor including stator 30, windings 50 passing therethrough and rotor 48 press fitted on the crankshaft 32 and having upper and lower counterweights 52 and 54, respectively.<br>
[0016] The upper surface of main bearing housing 24 is provided with a flat thrust bearing surface 56 on which is disposed an orbiting scroll member 58 having the usual spiral vane or wrap 60 on the upper surface thereof. Projecting downwardly from the lower surface of orbiting scroll member 58 is a cylindrical hub having a journal bearing 62 therein and in which is rotatively disposed a drive bushing 64 having an inner bore 66 in which crank pin 34 is drivingly disposed. Crank pin 34 has a flat on one surface which drivingly engages a flat surface (not shown) formed in a portion of bore 66 to provide a radially compliant driving arrangement, such as shown in assignee's U.S. Letters Patent 4,877,382, the<br>
5<br><br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. An Oldham coupling 68 is also provided positioned between orbiting scroll member 58 and bearing housing 24 and keyed to orbiting scroll member 58 and a non-orbiting scroll member 70 to prevent rotational movement of orbiting scroll member 58. Oldham coupling 68 is preferably of the type disclosed in assignee's copending U.S. Letters Patent 5,320,506, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0017] Non-orbiting scroll member 70 is also provided having a wrap 72 positioned in meshing engagement with wrap 60 of orbiting scrol! member 58. Non-orbiting scroll member 70 has a centrally disposed discharge passage 74 which communicates with an upwardly open recess 76 which in turn is in fluid communication with a discharge muffler chamber 78 defined by cap 14 and partition 22. An annular recess 80 is also formed in non-orbiting scroll member 70 within which is disposed a seal assembly 82. Recesses 76 and 80 and seal assembly 82 cooperate to define axial pressure biasing chambers which receive pressurized fluid being compressed by wraps 60 and 72 so as to exert an axial biasing force on non-orbiting scroll member 70 to thereby urge the tips of respective wraps 60, 72 into sealing engagement with the opposed end plate surfaces. Seal assembly 82 is preferably of the type described in greater detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,156,539, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Non-orbiting scroll member 70 is designed to be mounted to bearing housing 24 in a suitable manner such as disclosed in the aforementioned U.S.<br>
6<br><br>
Patent No. 4,877,382 or U.S. Patent No. 5,102,316, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0018] The integration of sensors with compressor 10 can be approached in one of two ways. First, the sensor can be placed completely within shell 12 itself and the signal leads can be routed through shell 12 using a hermetic feed-through. This method, however, will expose the sensitive electronics that are a part of the sensor to the harsh environment within shell 12 which includes both refrigerant, lubricating oils, and extreme temperature and pressure swings. This harsh environment will affect the reliability of the sensor. Hence this is a less desirable approach.<br>
[0019] In the second approach, the electronics that are a part of the device can be placed external to shell 12 of compressor 10 and only the sensing mechanism itself can be placed inside shell 12. This approach avoids exposing the electronics to the harsh environment in shell 12. When using this second approach, it is necessary to have the sensing mechanism in close proximity to the electronics. This is necessary because the signal (current/voltage etc.) level generated by the sensing mechanism is typically very small (in the milliamperes/millivolts) and it must be fed into the amplification and processing electronics with as little lead-wire as possible. Pressure sensor 28 uses this second approach and achieves both the desired objectives of isolation and close proximity for the electronics.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 2, pressure sensor 28 is shown in greater detail.   Pressure sensor 28 is an oil filled pressure sensor comprising a<br>
7<br><br>
housing 100, a body 102, a diaphragm 104, a pressure sensing device 106, signal conditioning electronics 108 and a protective member or cap 110.<br>
[0021] Housing 100 is a cup-shaped metal housing that is designed to be resistance welded within an aperture defined by shell 12. Resistance welding is a method wherein two metal objects with carefully designed geometry are placed between two copper electrodes connected to a low voltage AC or DC power source. The two electrodes are subjected to a large force that results in squeezing the two metal pieces to be joined. Once the squeeze force reaches a required level, AC or DC voltage is applied to the electrodes. This results in a very large current (typically thousands of Amps) to flow from one electrode to the other through the metal pieces. This large current produces a high localized temperature increase at the joint. The high temperature melts the two metal pieces at the desired joint area and bonds the two metal pieces together. After a carefully controlled time, the current is switched off and the molten material is allowed to cool. The cooled area represents the welded joint of the two metal pieces. Resistance welding is a fairly common process and it is widely employed in the building of a compressor due to its low cost, its controllability and the resulting joint that is both robust and leak proof.<br>
[0022] Body 102 is enlarged in Figure 2 for clarity. Body 102 extends through a bore 112 extending through housing 100. Body 102 is hermetically sealed within bore 112 by welding, glass fusing or other means known in the art. Body 102 defines an internal bore 114 having an enlarged portion 116, a pocket or an intermediate portion 118, a reduced diameter portion 120 and an upper<br>
8<br><br>
chamber or threaded portion 122. Diaphragm 104 is disposed within enlarged portion 116 and is laser welded or otherwise attached to a shoulder 124 formed between enlarged portion 116 and intermediate portion 118. Intermediate portion 118 is filled with silicone oil or any other type of fluid. Pressure sensing device 106 is laser welded or otherwise attached to a shoulder 126 formed between reduced diameter portion 120 and threaded portion 122. Pressure sensing device 106 and diaphragm 104 seal the silicone oil within intermediate portion 118. Pressure sensing device 106 includes a pressure sensing chip 128 and a hermetic feed through 130 for the electrical connection to pressure sensing chip 128.<br>
[0023] Signal conditioning electronics 108 are located within threaded portion 122 and are electrically connected to pressure sensing chip 128 through hermetic feed through 130. Protective cap 110 is threadingly received or otherwise secured to threaded portion 122. Protective cap 110 includes an aperture 132 through which a plurality of signal out leads 134 extend from signal conditioning electronics 108, for connection to the operating system for compressor 10.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Figure 3, a pressure sensor 28' is illustrated. Pressure sensor 28' is a direct replacement for pressure sensor 28. Pressure sensor 28' is a dry type of pressure sensor comprising a housing 200, a pressure sensing device 206, signal conditioning electronics 208 and a protective member in the form of potting material 310.<br>
9<br><br>
[0025] Housing 200 is a cup-shaped metal housing that is designed to be resistance welded to shell 12. Housing 200 defines a pocket 212 which is open to the outside of shell 12. The bottom of pocket 212 defines a diaphragm 214. Pressure sensing device 206 is bonded or otherwise secured to diaphragm 214 within pocket 212. Signal conditioning electronics 208 are located within pocket 212 and are electrically connected to pressure sensing device 206. Potting material 310 fills pocket 212 above the position of signal conditioning electronics 208 to provide protection for pressure sensor 28'. A plurality of signal out leads 234 extend from signal conditioning electronics 208 through potting material 310 for connection to the operating system for compressor 10.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 4, a pressure sensor 28" is illustrated. Pressure sensor 28" is also a direct replacement for pressure sensor 28. Pressure sensor 28" is a dry type of pressure sensor comprising a housing 300, a pressure sensing device 306, signal conditioning electronics 308 and a protective potting material 310.<br>
[0027] Housing 300 is a cup-shaped housing that is integrally formed as a part of shell 12. By integrally forming housing 300 as an integral part of shell 12, the resistance welding operation described above is eliminated. Housing 300 defines a pocket 312 which is open to the outside of shell 12. The bottom of pocket 312 defines a diaphragm 314. Pressure sensing device 306 is bonded or otherwise secured to diaphragm 314 within pocket 312. Signal conditioning electronics 308 are located within pocket 312 and are electrically connected to pressure sensing device 306.  Potting material 310 fills pocket 312<br>
10<br><br>
above the position of signal conditioning electronics 308 to provide protection for pressure sensor 28". A plurality of signal out leads 334 extend from signal conditioning electronics 308 through potting material 310 for connection to the operating system for compressor 10.<br>
[0028] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
