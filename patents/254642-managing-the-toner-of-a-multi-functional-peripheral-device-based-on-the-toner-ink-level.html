FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is applicable to printers or any image forming apparatus including MFP. The invention is meant for displaying the consumables' status to the end user. Toner cartridge is one of the consumable items on the printer or MFP. As per the proposed invention the percentage toner level remaining in the cartridge will be displayed on the device itself. More particularly this invention relates to a method of toner ink indicator for printing devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Presently there is no method to display the exact toner level on the device. Referring to figure 1, it shows the schematic diagram of one of the available technology i.e. displaying toner low in the display provided (like LCD or LED display) on the print device itself.<br>
Figure 1 shows a toner cartridge, a sensor and the LUI (LCD) screen. In this case toner cartridge is interfaced with sensor and in turn sensor is interfaced with LCD. Sensor will be checking for the ink inside the toner. If the ink goes below certain level then sensor sends a signal saying the toner level is low. If the ink goes below the other level then sensor sends a signal saying the toner level is empty.<br><br>
Figure 2 is the schematic diagram of another available technology I. e. display OT toner low or toner empty through the software interface. It shows a toner cartridge, a sensor, host interface module and the host interface PC. Here toner cartridge is interfaced with sensor and sensor is interfaced with host interface module. Also interface between host PC and printer is shown. In this case, sensor detects the level and sends the signal to host interface module which in turn sends it to host PC to display the status in GUI.<br>
Though the above technology displays the toner level, but it does not show the exact toner level remaining. In the existing art a warning will be displayed only when the toner level goes below a predefined value or toner becomes empty.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is meant for displaying the remaining toner level in an efficient manner, the toner being the consumable item in the printers or any image forming apparatus including MFP. As per the invention, the percentage remaining toner level in the cartridge will be displayed on the device itself. The main advantage of this system is that the user can estimate the remaining life of the consumable by which he can place the order for the consumable, much before the time it is exhausted to avoid problems like delay in procuring the consumable, non availability of the consumable in short notice etc.<br><br>
The present invention helps end user to know the percentage toner level remaining without the help of a host computer.<br>
The present invention provides a method to check the exact toner level on the device. The status will be displayed to the user in LUI when the consumable, toner in this case, is<br>
o   Below a minimum predefined percentage i.e. Toner Low<br>
o   Completely empty i.e. Toner Empty.<br>
&gt;	The device must be queried through a host PC interface to know the percentage level of toner remaining, which will be displayed on Host PC.<br>
&gt;	An email alert message will be generated automatically to indicate toner status either low or empty as per configurations.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of toner ink indicator for printing devices comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a key on the device as Toner Status key;<br>
(b)	triggering   an event to toner sensor and the sensor checking the toner status when the Toner Status key is pressed;<br>
(c)	updating the toner status if any change in the toner level; and<br>
(d)	obtaining a report on the status of the toner.<br>
The report on the status of the toner is obtained as a status bar on the LCD display in percentage. The report on the status of the toner is obtained as report<br><br>
which is printed in a print device. The status of the toner is obtained by sending the toner status report by fax/e-mail. A threshold level is configured for the toner level where the toner status is reported when the set threshold is reached.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a toner cartridge, a sensor and the LUI (LCD) screen.<br>
Figure 2 is the schematic diagram of another available technology i.e. display of toner low or toner empty through the software interface.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of Ul &amp; toner sub system for present invention.<br>
Figure 4 displays the percentage remaining toner level on LCD.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the flow of displaying toner status on device.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained With reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However, in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The current invention uses following steps to support display of percentage toner level remaining on the device itself,<br>
1.	A key will be provided on the device as Toner Status key.<br>
2.	If that key is pressed, the status of the toner should be displayed on LCD display in percentage.<br>
3.	User can scroll the LCD display using left/right keys to view more information like Print Toner Usage etc.<br>
4.	User can get the report on the toner status with date.<br>
5.	If the toner status is less than 30%, provide the option in Ul to dial the service number for ordering.<br>
6.	Above option should not be displayed when status is greater than 30%.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of Ul &amp; toner sub system for present invention. It shows User Input and Display. Here User Input is on press of a button provided<br><br>
on the device, it triggers an event to toner sensor and gets the toner status. The status will be formatted and displayed on LCD display status bar.<br>
Figure 4 displays the percentage remaining toner level on LCD. It shows a toner status button and status bar (LCD). Both button and status bar are mounted on MFP/Printer device. Whenever user presses toner status button, it displays the status on its status bar.<br>
The figure 5 depicts the detailed function of the invention.<br>
When the button is pressed, it triggers an event to toner sensor and the sensor checks the toner status. If there is any change in the toner level, it updates the toner status. Otherwise, it again goes to step 1 where it again checks the status. Then the user is provided with the options of displaying the status in the device, taking a print out of the status or sending the toner status report by fax/e-mail.<br>
As mentioned in the Figure 3, Toner Subsystem which comprises of toner and sensor that calculates the used/remaining life of the consumable, based on this, value of the remaining consumable will be displayed on the LUI.<br>
The toner calculation method is discussed in the U.S. patent No. 6,925,268 (estimating toner levels).<br><br>
The method of toner ink indicator for printing devices involves few steps. A key on the device as Toner Status key is provided. When the Toner Status key is pressed an event is triggered to toner sensor and the sensor checks the toner status. If any change in the toner level is indicated the toner status is updated. Finally a report on the status of the toner is obtained. The report on the status of the toner is obtained as a status bar on the LCD display in percentage. The report on the status of the toner is obtained as report which is printed in a print device. The status of the toner is obtained by sending the toner status report by fax/e-mail. A threshold level is configured for the toner level where the toner status is reported when the set threshold is reached.<br>
