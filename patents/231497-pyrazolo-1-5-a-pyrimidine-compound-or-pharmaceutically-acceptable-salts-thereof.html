Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, their use in the inhibition of protein kinases, their use in medicine and particularly in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of diseases including inflammatory disorders, cancer, angiogenesis, diabetes and neurological disorders. The invention also provides processes for the manufacture of said compounds, compositions containing them and processes for manufacturing such compositions.<br>
Background Art<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups in proteins. Approximately 2% of the genes encoded by the human genome are predicted to encode protein kinases. The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues on a target protein can dramatically alter its function in several ways including activating or inhibiting enzymatic activity, creating or blocking binding sites for other proteins, altering subcellular localisation or controlling protein stability. Consequently, protein kinases are pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and survival (Hunter, T. Cell, 1995, SO, 224-236). Of the many different cellular functions known to require the actions of protein kinases, some represent targets for therapeutic intervention for certain disease (Cohen, P. Nature Rev. Drug Disc., 2002,<br>
1, 309-315).<br>
It is known that several diseases arise from, or involve, aberrant protein kinase activity. In humans, protein tyrosine Idnasec are known to have a significant role in the development of many diseases including diabetes, cancer and have also been linked to a wide variety of congenital syndromes (Robertson. S. C. Trends Genet. 2000, 16, 265-271). Seririe/threonine kinases also represent a class of ensymes, inhibitors of which are likely to have relevance to the treatment of cancer, diabetes and a variety of inflammatory disorders (Adams, J. L. et al. Prog. Med. Chem. 2001, 38,1-60).<br>
One of the principal mechanisms by which cellular regulation is affected is through the transduction of extracellular signals across the membrane that in turn modulate biochemical pathways within the cell. Protein phosphorylation represents one course by which intracellular signals are propagated from molecule to molecule resulting finally in cellular responses. These signal transduction cascades are regulated and often overlapping as evidenced by the existence of many protein kinases as well as phosphatases. It is currently believed that a number of disease and/or disorders are a result of either aberrant activation or inhibition in the molecular components of kinase cascades.<br>
Three potential mechanisms for inhibition of protein kinases have been identified thus far. These include a pseudo-substrate mechanism, an adenine mimetic mechanism and the locking of the enzyme into an inactive conformation by using surfaces other than the active site (Taylor, S. S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997, 1, 219-226). The majority of inhibitors identified/designed to date act at the ATP-binding site. Such /OTP-competilive inhibitors have demonstrated selectivity by virtue of their ability to target the more poorly conserved areas of the ATP-binding site (Wang, Z. et al.<br>
Structure 1998, 6, 1117-1128).<br>
There exists a need for the provision of further compounds that are inhibitors of protein kinases.<br>
IVIAPKAF-K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2) .b a serine/threonine kinase that operates immediately downstream of the p38 kinase in the stress-induced MAPK pathway (Figure 1).<br>
The p38 kinase pathway is involved in transducing the effects of a variety of stress-related extracellular stimuli such as heat shock, UV light, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of this pathway results in the phosphorylation of transcription and initiation factors, and affects cell division, apoptosis, invasiveness of cultured cells and the inflammatory response (Martin-Bianco, Bioessays 22, 637-645 (2000)).<br>
p3S kinase itself activates a number of protein kinases other than the MAPKAP kinases such as Mnkl/2, PRAK and MSK1 (Figure 1). The specific and/or overlapping functions of the majority of these targets have yet to be resolved. This pathway has been of particular interest for the discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents. Previous strategies to intervene this pathway have involved the development of selective inhibitors of p38 kinase. Such inhibitors are effective both for inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in cell-based models and animal models of chronic inflammations (Lee et al., Immunopharmacology 47,185-201 (2000)). p38 kinase knockout mouse is embryonic lethal. And cells derived from such embryos have demonstrated a number of abnormalities in fundamental cell responses. These observations indicate that caution should be paid to the long-term therapy with p38 kinase inhibitors.<br>
An alternative strategy for the development of anti-inflammatory agents could be the inhibition of this pathway at the level of MAPKAP-K2. Human MAPKAP-K2 Iws two proline-rich domains at its f T-terminu3 follov/ed by the fcinase domain ao.d l:he C-terminal regulatory domain. This kinase has low homology with other serine/threonine kinases except MAPKAP-K3 and -K4. The C-terminal regulatory domain contains a bipartite nuclear localisation signal and a nuclear export signal. The crystal structure of inactive MAPKAP-K2 has been resolved (Meng, W. et. al. J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37401-37405 (2002)). Activation of MAPKAP-K2 by p3S kinase occurs via selective phosphorylation of threonine residues 222 and 334 (Stokoe et al., EMBO J. 11, 3985-3994 (1992)). MAPKAP-K2 has an amphiphilic A-helix motif located within its C-terminal region that is likely to block the binding of substrates. The dual phosphorylation by p3S kinase has been proposed to reposition this motif resulting in enhanced catalytic activity (You-Li et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270, 202-206 (1995)). MAPKAP-K2 is present in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, and translocates to the cytoplasm upon cell stimulation. This kinase is known to phosphorylate a number of nuclear transcription factors as well as cytosolic proteins such as heat shock proteins and 5-lipoxygenase (Stokoe et al., FEES Lett. 313, 307-313 (1992), Werz, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 5261-5266 (2000), Heidenreich, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14434-14443 (1999), Tan, et al., EMBO J. 15,4629-4642 (1996), Neufeld, J. Biol. Chem. 275,20239-20242 (2000)). All such substrates contain a unique ammo acid motif (XX-Hyd-XRXXSXX, where Hyd is a bulky hydrophobic residue) that is required for efficient phosphorylation by MAPKAP-K2 (Stokoe et al.. Biochem. J.296, 843-849 (1993)).<br>
Currently MAPKAP-K2 is the only p3S kinase substrate for which a specific<br>
function has been identified. A specific role for MAPKAP-K2 in mediating the inflammatory response has been strongly indicated by the phenotype of the lvlAFKj^4I2-deficient mouse (MAPKAF-K2"'") (Kotlyarov, et al.f Mature Cell Biol. 1, 94-97 (1999)). This mouse is viable and normal e::cept for a significantly reduced inflammatory response. Recently it has also been shown thai MAPJLAJ'-K2 deficiency results in a marked neuroprotection from ischaemic brain injury (Wang et al., J. 13iol Chem. 277, 43968-43972 (2002)). MAPKAP-K2 is believed to regulate the translation and/or stability of important pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs. It is thought to function via phosphorylation of proteins that bind to the AU-rich elements found within untranslated regions of these cytokines. The identity of these proteins is currently under investigation.<br>
MAPKAP-K2 therefore represents an intervention point in the stress-induced kinase cascade for perturbation of the inflammatory response.<br>

The compounds of the invention can also be used to prevent or treat disorders resulting from inflammation. These include, for example, inflammatory bowel disorder, bronchitis, asthma, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, allergies of various types, and possibly Alzheimer's disease. Autoimmune diseases which may also be treated or<br>
prevented by the compounds of the present invention include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren S3Tidrome, psoriatic arthritis, glomerulonephritis. cc-ltroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Graves's disease, autoimmune gastritis, diabetes, autoimmune juaemolylis anaemia, autoimmune neutropaenia, tlirombocytopenia, atopic dermatitis, chronic active hepatitis, inyasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative coh'tis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis or graft \&gt;s host disease.<br>
A compound of the present invention may be administered simultaneously, subsequently or sequentially with one or more other active agent, such as an anti-inflammatory agent e.g, p38 inhibitor, glutamate receptor antagonist, calcium channel antagonist, a chemotherapeutic agent or an antiproliferative agent. For example, for acute treatment, a p38 inhibitor may be administered to 'a patient prior to administering a compound of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention will normally be administered in a daily dosage regimen (for an adult patient) of, for example, an oral dose of between 1 mg and 2000 mg, preferably between 30 mg and 1000 mg, e.g. between 10 and 250 mg or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of between 0.1 mg and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 50 rag, e.g. between 1 and 25 mg of the compound of the formula I, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base, the compound being administered 1 to 4 times per day.

In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing a protein kinase-mediated disorder in an individual, which method comprises administering to said individual one or more compounds of the invention or a composition of the invention. The active compound is preferably administered in a<br>
cumulative effective amount. The individual ma)' be in need of the treatment or prevention. Any of the protein kinase-mediated disorders listed above in relation to the fifth aspect may be the subject of treatment or prevention according to the si:;:th aspect. One or more oilier active agent may be administered to the individual simultaneously, subsequently or sequentially to administering the compound. The other active agent may be an anti-inflammatory agent such as a p3S inhibitor, glutamate receptor antagonist, calcium channel antagonist, a chemotherapeutic agent or an antiproliferative agent.<br>

Preferably the assay is for the protein kinase inhibiting activity of the compound. The compounds of the invention may be assayed in vitro, in vivo, in silica, or in a primary cell culture or a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of the kinase activity of activated protein kinase. Alternatively, in vitro assays may quantitate the ability of a compound to bind protein kinase and may be measured either by radiolabelling the compound prior to binding, then isolating the inhibitor/ protein kinase complex and<br>
determining the amount of the radiolabel bound or by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with protein kinase bound to known radioligands. An ezample of an assay which ma}' be used is Scintillation Frccirnity Assay ("PAX preferably using radiolabelled ATP. Another example is ELISA. An;1 type or isoforrn of protein kinase may be used in these assays.<br>
In a tenth aspect, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the activity or function of a protein kinase. which method comprises exposing a protein kinase to a compound or a composition of the invention. The method may be performed in a research model, in vitro, in silica, or in vivo such as in an animal model. A suitable animal model may be a kainic acid model in rat or mice, traumatic brain injury model in rat, or MPTP in mice for neurodegenerative disorder and a collagen induced arthritis model in rat or mice, type II collagen-antibodies induced arthritis in mice, or a LPS induced endotoxin shock model in mice for inflammatory disease.<br>
