The manipulation cable 84 is formed by movably inserting an inner cable 93 in an outer cable 92. A cable end 94 which is mounted on one end portion of the outer cable 92 is supported on a cable support member 95 which is fixedly secured to a front surface of the front wall 30c of the storage box 30 in a state that the cable end 94 is arranged below the above-mentioned transmission lever 86. One end of the inner cable 93 which projects from the above-mentioned cable end 94 is connected to another end of the above-mentioned transmission lever 86. [0045]<br>
Further, a cable end 96 which is formed on another end of the outer cable 92 is supported on a cable support member 97 which is fixedly secured to the above-mentioned left-side pivot plate 23. Another end of the inner cable 93 which projects from the cable end 96 is connected to the locking member 82. Further, another end of the inner cable 93 is connected to the locking member 82 in a state that a towing force in the downward direction acts due to a spring force of<br>
the spring 91 which is provided between the locking member 82 and the pivot plate 23. That is, a force which always tows downwardly is applied to the manipulation cable 84 due to the above-mentioned spring 91. [0046]<br>
On the other hand, the position of the rotary shaft 85 which allows the manipulation lever 83 and the power transmission lever 86 to be supported on the front wall 30c of the storage box 30 is set such that even when the manipulation lever 83 is rotatably manipulated to assume either one of the locked position shown in Fig. 4 and the unlocked position shown in Fig. 6, the towing force from the above-mentioned manipulation cable 84 acts on the power transmission lever 86 on a side to hold the position. [0047]<br>
Here, when the manipulation lever 83 is rotatably manipulated to the locked position shown in Fig. 4, the locking member 82 is engaged with the engaging hole 89 of the second rotation restricting member 77 and hence, the erected position of the stand 32 is locked. Further, in the state that the stand 32 assumes the erected position, when the manipulation lever 83 is rotatably manipulated to the unlocked position shown in Fig. 6, the stand 32 assumes the unlocked state in which the locking member 82 is disengaged from the engaging hole 89 of the second rotation restricting member 77 and hence, it is<br>
possible to perform the manipulation to spring up the stand<br>
32 to the stored position shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[0048]<br>
Here, the manipulation cable 84 extends downwardly from the power transmission lever 86 along the front surface of the front wall 30c in the above-mentioned storage box 30, penetrates an opening portion 98 formed in an upper portion of the left-side pivot plate 23 from the outside of the left-side rear pipe 21 out of both rear pipes 21 and extends between both pivot plates 23 , and, further, extends to the locking member 82 after passing between a pivot shaft 99 which supports a front portion of the rear fork 24 on both pivot plates 23 . and the connection wall 80 arranged behind the pivot shaft 99. Further, on an intermediate portion of the outer cable 92 of the manipulation cable 84 which extends along the outside of one rear pipe 21 and penetrates the opening portion 98 from the outside of one pivot plate 23, a cable cover 100 is mounted. [0049]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of this embodiment is explained. On the rear wall 30e of the storage box 30, the accessory portion 68 which constitutes the accessory box 69 which bulges toward the rear side from the rear wall 30e is contiguously formed and hence, it is possible to increase the storing capacity of the storage box 30. Further, the manipulation lever 83 of the stand locking device 81 is arranged<br>
in the inside of the storage box 30 and, at the same time, is supported on the front wall 30c of the storage box 30 in a manipulable manner and hence, even when the capacity of the storage box 30 is increased, the arrangement of the manipulation lever 83 is not influenced. Further, when the upper side of the storage box 30 is opened by releasing the rider's seat 45, it is possible to easily recognize the manipulation lever 83 and hence, the manipulation lever 83 can be easily manipulated thus enhancing the mampulability of the manipulation lever 83. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, even in a state that the helmet 46 which occupies a relatively large capacity is stored in the inside of the storage box 30, by storing the helmet 46 in a posture in which a top portion of the helmet 46 faces the front wall 30c, it is possible to easily manipulate the manipulation lever 83 while obviating the interference between the helmet 46 and the manipulation lever 83. [0050]<br>
Further, the rear portions of the pair of left and right pivot plates 23 which extend downwardly from the rear portion of the main pipe 20 in a state that the pivot plates 23 rotatably support the stand 32 at the lower end portions thereof are connected with each other using the connection wall 80 which forms the approximately U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape which opens frontwardly together with both pivot plates<br>
23 and, at the same time, the locking member 82 which changes over the engagement with and the disengagement from the stand 32 in the erected state in response to the manipulation of the manipulation lever 83 is arranged in front of the connection wall 80. Accordingly, the locking member 82 is arranged at the portion which is surrounded by both pivot plates 23 and the connection wall 80 and hence, it is possible to prevent the locking member 82 from being splashed with water or mud from the rear wheel WR thus always assuring the smooth operation of the locking member 82. [0051]<br>
Further, since the locking member 82 is supported on the connection wall 80 by way of the support member 87, the connection wall 80 is arranged immediately behind the locking member 82 whereby it is possible to more reliably prevent the locking member 82 from being splashed with water or mud from the rear wheel WR. [0052]<br>
Further, the manipulation cable 84 which transmits the manipulation force generated by the manipulation lever 83 to the locking member 82 is arranged in a state that the manipulation cable 84 passes between the pivot shaft 99 which supports the front portion of the rear fork 24 on both pivot plates 23 and the connection wall 80 arranged behind the pivot shaft 99 and hence, it is possible to arrange the manipulation<br>
cable 84 in a state that the manipulation cable 84 is not<br>
influenced by the tilting rear fork 24.<br>
[0053]<br>
Further, by forming the opening portion which allows the manipulation cable 84 to pass therethrough in one of both pivot plates 23 , it is unnecessary to forcibly bent the manipulation cable 84 and, at the same time, it is possible to smoothly arrange the manipulation cable 84 with the shortest distance. [0054]<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been explained heretofore, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment and various design changes can be made without departing from the present invention described in claims.<br>
