				<td>GAS/LIQUID  CONTACT   TRAY<br>
The  present  invention  relates   to  a  gas/liquid  contact tray  for  use  in  a  column  for  counter-currently  contacting gas   and  liquid.   Such  a  column  is  any  column  in  which  gas and  liquid  are  counter-currently  contacted  to  exchange heat   or  matter.   An  example  of  such  a  column  is   a fractionation  column  and  a  further  example  is  a  vacuum distillation  column.   In  such  a  column  liquid  flows, during  normal   operation,   downwards   from  top  to  bottom, whereas  gas   flows  upwards  from  bottom  to  top.   In  the specification  and  in  the  claims  the  word   'gas'   is   used  to refer  to  gas   and  to  vapour.<br>
Such   a   column  is  provided  with   a  number   of  horizontal gas/liquid  contact  trays  arranged  one  above  the  other. Each  tray  comprises   a  perforated  panel  provided  with  one or  more   downcomers.   The   downcomer   is   a   conduit   for downward  passing  of  liquid  arranged  in  an  opening  in  the perforated  panel,   the  part  of  the  wall   of  the  downcomer extending  above  the  perforated  panel  is   called  the downcomer  weir,   and  the  part  of  the  downcomer  extending below  the  perforated  panel  is  called  the  downcomer  apron.<br>
During  normal  operation  liquid  collected  on  a  tray flows   over  the  perforated  panel  where  it  is   contacted with  upwardly  flowing  gas  passing  through  the perforations.   Then  the  liquid  will   flow  over  the downcomer  weir  into  the  downcomer  and  onto  the  perforated panel   of  the  tray  below,   and  so  on.   It  will  be  understood that  the  downcomers  of  two  adjacent  trays   are  not  placed directly  above  each  other,   but  spaced  apart   in  lateral direction   (or  staggered)   in  order  to  prevent   liquid  from falling  directly  into  the  downcomer  of  the  lower  tray. Moreover,   the  downcomers  are   so  located  that  the  liquid<br>
exiting  the  downcomers   can  flow  evenly  over  the perforated  panel.   In  this  way  it  is   achieved  that  the time  during  which  gas   and  liquid  are  in  contact  with  each other  is   independent  from  the  position  of  a   liquid element  on  the  perforated  panel.<br>
The   gas/liquid  contacting  tray  to  which  the  present invention  relates   comprises   a  perforated  panel  of  which the  area  is  divided  in  two  or  more  parallel   sections, wherein  either  the  odd  numbered  sections  or  the  even numbered  sections   are  provided  with  a  plurality  of downcomers   directed  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  the section,   and  wherein  the  bottoms   of  the  downcomers   are provided  with  lateral   outflow  openings   directed  in  the direction  of  the  sections.<br>
Such  a  gas/liquid  contacting  tray  is  disclosed  in Belgian  patent   specification  No.   584   42 6,   and  described in  more  detail  with  reference  to  Figures   8,   9  and  14   IV.<br>
The  gas/liquid  contacting  tray  shown  in   Figures   8   and 9  of  this  publication  comprises   a  perforated  panel   of which  the   area   is   divided  in  two  parallel   sections, wherein  either  the   first   section   (Figure   8)   or  the   second section   (Figure   9)   is  provided  with  a  plurality  of downcomers   directed  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  the section,   and  wherein  the  bottoms  of  the  downcomers  are provided  with  lateral  outflow  openings  directed  in  the direction  of  the  sections.   This   arrangement  is   selected to  get  an  even  distribution  of  liquid  flowing  during normal  operation  over  the  perforated  panel,   so  as   to prevent  a   stagnant   zone  at  near  the   edge  of  the perforated  panel,   where  the  liquid  could  reside  longer than  the  average  residence  time  of  liquid  on  the  tray. Applicant,   however,   had  found  that  this  arrangement  did not  fully  eliminate  the  stagnant   zone.<br>
It  is   an  object  of  the  present  invention  to  overcome this  problem.<br>
To  this   end  the  gas/liquid  contact  tray  according  to the  present  invention  for  use  in  a  column  for   counter-currently  contacting  gas'  and  liquid  comprises   a perforated  panel  of  which  the  area  is  divided  in  two  or more  parallel   sections,   wherein  either  the  odd  numbered sections   or  the  even  numbered  sections  are  provided  with a  plurality  of  downcomers  directed  perpendicular  to  the direction  of  the  section,   wherein  the  bottoms   of  the downcomers   are  provided  with  lateral  outflow  openings directed  in  the  direction  of  the  sections,   and  wherein the  bottom  of  each  downcomer  in  the  section(s) neighbouring  the  wall  of  the  column  is  also  provided  with a  frontal  outflow  opening  directed  in  the  direction  of the  wall.<br>
The   invention  will  now  be  described  by  way  of   example in  more   detail  with  reference  to  the  accompanying drawings,   wherein<br>
Figure   1   shows  schematically  a  top  view  of  a gas/liquid  contacting  tray  according  to  the  present invention;<br>
Figure   2   shows  schematically  a  top  view  of  a gas/liquid  contacting  tray  according  to  the  present invention,   which  is  arranged  below  the  tray  of  Figure   1; and<br>
Figure  3   shows  a  cross-sectional  view  along  the lines   III-III   of  Figures   1   and  2,   wherein  also  the   column wall  is   shown.<br>
Reference  is  now  made  to  Figures  1  and  2.   The gas/liquid  contact  tray  shown  in  Figure  1   is  referred  to with  reference  numeral   10,   and\the  tray  shown  in   Figure  2 with  reference  numeral  20.   Each  tray  10  and  20  comprises a  perforated  panel  11   and  21.   The  edge  of  the  perforated panel  is   referred  to  by  reference  numeral   11a  and  21a. For   the   sake   of   clarity  only  part   of  the  perforated  panel is  hatched.<br>
The  area  of  the  perforated  panel   11  and  21  is  divided in  three  parallel   sections   12,   13,   14   and  22,   23   and  24. The  dashed  lines   15   and  25  indicate   the  boundaries between  adjacent   sections.<br>
The   odd  numbered  sections   12   and  14   of  the  tray  shown in  Figure   1  are  provided  with  a plurality  of  elongated downcomers   16a,   16b  and  16c  and  17a,   17b   and  17c.   The elongated  downcomers   16a,   16b  and  16c  and  17a,   17b  and 17c  are  directed  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  the sections  12  and  14,   in  other  words  their  longitudinal axes   (not   shown)   are  directed  perpendicular  to  the longitudinal  axis   (not  shown)   of  the   sections.<br>
The  even  numbered  section  23  of  the  tray  shown  in Figure  2  is  provided  with  three  elongated  downcomers   28a, 28b  and  28c  directed  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of the   section  23.   The  projections   of  the  downcomers   16a-c and  17a-c  of  tray  10  on  tray  20   are   shown  by  means   of dashed  lines.<br>
The bottom of each of the elongated downcomers 16a-c, 17a-c and 28a-c is provided with lateral outflow openings directed  in  the  direction  of  the   sections   12,   14   and  23.<br>
These  lateral  outflow  openings   are  shown  more  clearly in  Figure  3,   which  Figure  shows   the  trays   10  and  20 arranged  in  a   column  of  which  the  wall   is   referred  to  by reference  numeral  30.   The  supports  of  the  trays  10  and  20 are  not  shown.   In  this  Figure  the  reference  numeral  31  is used  to  refer  to  the  downcomer  weirs   and  the  reference numeral   32   is  used  to  refer  to  the  downcomer  apron.   The lateral  outflow  openings  are  referred  to  by  reference numerals   3 6,   37   and  38.<br>
Furthermore,   the  bottoms  of  the   downcomers  16a-c  in the  section  12  neighbouring  the  wall   30  of  the  column  are also  provided  with  frontal  outflow  openings   4 0  directed in  the  direction  of  the  wall  30.   The   section  neighbouring the  wall  will  be  an  odd  numbered  section.<br>
During  normal  operation  liquid  exiting  the  downcomers of  the   tray   (not  shown)   above  the  tray  10  is   collected  on this  tray  10   and  it  is   contacted  with  upwardly  flowing gas  passing  through  the  perforations  of  the  perforated panel   11.   The  liquid  flows   to   the  downcomers   16a-c  and 17a-c.   The  liquid  flows   over  the  weirs  31   (see  arrows   41 in  Figure  3),   and  it  exits   the  downcomers   16a-c  and  17a-c through  the  lateral  outlet  openings   36  and  37   (arrows   42) and  through  the  frontal   outlet   openings   4 0   (arrows   43). The   arrows   42   and  43   are  also   shown  in  Figure  2.<br>
The   liquid  is  collected  on  tray  30   and  it  is contacted  with  upwardly  flowing  gas  passing  through  the perforations   of  the  perforated  panel  21.   The   liquid  flows over  the  perforated  panel  21   to  the   downcomers   28a-c.   The liquid  flows  over  the  weirs   31   (see  arrows   45  in Figure   3),   and  it  exits  the  downcomers  28a-c  through  the lateral   outlet  openings   38    (arrow  47).<br>
The   liquid  flowing  out   of  the   frontal  openings   40 causes   turbulence  in  the  liquid  on  the  tray  20  near  the wall   30   of  the  column,   and  in  this  way  stagnant   zones near  the  wall   30  are  effectively  prevented.<br>
In   order  to  increase  the  flow  path  length  1    (see Figure   3),   the  side  of  a  downcomer  apron  that  is   directed to  the   downcomer  weir  pertaining  to  the  below  tray  can  be tilted.   This   is   shown  for  the   downcomer   17b  in  Figure   3. A  downcomer  apron  tapered  in  that  way  can  also  be   applied to  the   downcomers   28a-c  of  the  tray  20.<br>
In  the  embodiment  of  the  invention  shown  in  the Figures,   both  the  lateral  outlets   36,   37   and  38   and  the frontal   outlets   40  are   in  the   form  of  slits,   In  an alternative  embodiment,   the  bottom  of  the  downcomer  is closed  and  the  outlets   are   formed  by  openings  near  the closed  bottom.<br>
In  the  embodiment  as   shown  in  the  Figures,   the trays   10   and  20   are  divided  in  three   sections,   wherein<br>
the  number  of  downcomers  of the  tray  10  (six)  is twice<br>
the  number  of  downcomers   (three)   of  the  tray 20.   Suitably the  number  of  sections  is  even,   two,   four,   six  or so  that  each  tray  can have  the  same  nu^er  of downcomers. The  number  of  downcomers per  section  is  suitably  in   the<br>
range  of  from three   to  five.<br>
Reference has been directed, in pursuance of Section 18(2) of the Patents Act, 1970 to the specification filed in pursuance of application number IN/PCT/2002/00778/DEL.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
