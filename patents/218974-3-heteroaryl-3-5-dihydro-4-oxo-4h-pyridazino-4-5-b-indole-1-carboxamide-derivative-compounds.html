The compounds of the invention can exist in<br>
the form of bases, of addition salts with acids, of<br>
solvates or of hydrates.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be<br>
prepared by the processes illustrated subsequently.<br>
Throughout the continuation of the<br>
description, the intermediate compounds (II), (III),<br>
(IV) and (V) are those presented in the scheme below.<br>
According to a first preparation route, a<br>
compound of general formula (II), in which X and R1 are<br>
as defined above and R" and R" each represent,<br>
independently of one another, a (C1-C4) alkyl group, is<br>
treated with a heteroarylhydrazine in a polar solvent<br>
in the presence of acid at the reflux temperature, in<br>
order to obtain an ester of general formula (III) in<br>
which X, R1, Het and R" are as defined above.<br>
This ester is converted to the amide of<br>
general formula (I) by reaction with an amine of<br>
general formula HNR2R3, in which R2 and R3 are as defined<br>
above, for example in the presence of a<br>
trialkylaluminium derivative in a solvent such as<br>
toluene, or else by saponification of the ester of<br>
general formula (III) to the acid, using, for example,<br>
lithium hydroxide in a mixture of methanol, water and<br>
an ethereal solvent, and then by coupling the acid<br>
obtained, according to methods known to a person<br>
skilled in the art, with an amine of general formula<br>
HNR2R3 as defined above.<br>
According to a second preparation route, a<br>
diester of general formula (II) is treated with<br>
hydrazine by heating in a solvent, such as acetic acid<br>
or toluene, in the presence of acid, in order to obtain<br>
an ester of general formula (IV) in which X, R1 and R"<br>
are as defined above.<br>
This ester is converted to the amide of<br>
general formula (V) , in which X, R1, R2 and R3 are as<br>
defined above, by reaction with an amine of general<br>
formula HNR2R3, in which R2 and R3 are as defined above,<br>
for example in the presence of a trialkylaluminium<br>
derivative in a solvent such as toluene.<br>
Finally, an iV-heteroarylation is carried out<br>
by a coupling reaction in the presence of a heteroaryl<br>
halide or else of a heteroarylboronic acid derivative<br>
and of a metal salt, such as a copper salt, resulting<br>
in a compound of general formula (I) .<br>
This N-heteroarylation reaction can also be<br>
carried out on the compound of general formula (IV) to<br>
result in the ester of general formula (III) . This<br>
ester is finally converted to the amide of general<br>
formula (I) by reaction with, an amine of general<br>
formula HNR2R3, in which R2 and R3 are as defined above,<br>
for example in a mixture of solvents, such as, in<br>
particular, dichloromethane and methanol.<br>
The amides of general formulae (V) and (I)<br>
can also be obtained by saponification of the esters of<br>
respective general formulae (IV) and (III) to the acids<br>
and by then coupling the acids obtained with an amine<br>
of general formula HNR2R3, as defined above, according<br>
to methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The boronic acid derivatives carrying a<br>
heteroaromatic group are commercially available or can<br>
be prepared by methods analogous to those known in the<br>
literature (Synth. Commun., 1996, 26, 3543 and Li<br>
et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 4570).<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) for<br>
which X, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and for<br>
which Het represents a heteroaromatic group of<br>
1-oxidopyridinyl type can be prepared by oxidation,<br>
using an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, of<br>
the equivalent derivative for which Het represents a<br>
heteroaromatic group of pyridinyl type.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) for<br>
which X, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and for<br>
which Het represents a heteroaromatic group of<br>
2-halopyridinyl type can be prepared by halogenation,<br>
using a phosphorus trihalide, for example, of the<br>
equivalent derivative for which Het represents a<br>
heteroaromatic group of 1-oxidopyridinyl type.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) for<br>
which X, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above and for<br>
which Het represents a heteroaromatic group of<br>
2-alkoxypyridinyl type can be prepared by substitution,<br>
by means of a sodium alkoxide, for example, of the<br>
equivalent derivative for which Het represents a<br>
heteroaromatic group of 2-halopyridinyl type.<br>
The preparation of the starting compounds of<br>
general formula (II) is disclosed in the document<br>
WO-A-00/44751 in the case where X is a chlorine atom.<br>
This preparation method is employed analogously when X<br>
is a fluorine atom.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention<br>
relates to the compounds of general formula (II)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
R" and R" each represent, independently of one another,<br>
a (C1-C4)alkyl group.<br>
of use as synthetic intermediates in the preparation of<br>
the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention<br>
relates to the compounds of general formula (III)<br>
in which <br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
Het represents a heteroaromatic group of pyridinyl,<br>
quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl or<br>
pyridazinyl type, it being possible for the<br>
heteroaromatic group to carry one or more halogen atoms<br>
and/or one or more (C1-C4) alkyl or (C1-C4) alkoxy groups,<br>
R" represents a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
of use as synthetic intermediates in the preparation of<br>
the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention<br>
relates to the compounds of general formula (IV)<br><br>
in which<br>

R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4) alkyl group,<br>
R2 and R3 each represent, independently of one another,<br>
a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4) alkyl group or else R2 and R3<br>
form, with the nitrogen atom which carries them, a<br>
pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl or<br>
4-alkylpiperazinyl group,<br>

the compounds of general formula (I).<br>
Other compounds are novel and of use as<br>
synthetic intermediates in the preparation of the<br>

The chemical structures and the physical<br>
properties of some compounds of the xnvention are<br>
illustrated in the following table.<br>
In the "Salt" column of this table, "HC1"<br>
denotes a hydrochloride and "-" denotes a compound in<br>
the form of the base. The acid:base molar ratios are<br>
indicated opposite.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been<br>
subjected to pharmacological tests which have<br>
demonstrated their advantage as substances with<br>
therapeutic activities.<br>
The compounds of the invention also exhibit<br>
characteristics of solubility in water which promote<br>
good in vivo activity.<br>
Study of the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptors (PBR or p sites)<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the<br>
invention for PBR or p sites (sites of binding of<br>
peripheral type to benzodiazepines) was determined.<br>
The p site receptors can be labelled<br>
selectively in rat kidney membranes incubated in the<br>
presence of [3H]Ro5-4864. The compounds of the invention<br>
have formed the subject of an in vitro study with<br>
respect to their affinity for these receptors.<br>
The animals used are male Sprague-Dawley rats<br>
(Iffa Credo) weighing 180 to 3 00 mg. After<br>
decapitation, the kidney is removed and the tissue is<br>
homogenized at 4°C using a Polytron™ homogenizer for<br>
2 min at 6/10 of the maximum speed in 35 volumes of<br>
50 mM Na2HPO4 phosphate buffer at a pH adjusted to 7.5<br>
with NaH2PO4. The membrane homogenate is filtered<br>
through gauze and diluted tenfold with buffer.<br>
[3H]Ro5-4864 (specific activity:<br>
70-90 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear), at a concentration<br>
of 0.5 nM, is incubated in the presence of 100 µl of<br>
the membrane homogenate in a final volume of 1 ml of<br>
buffer comprising the test compound.<br>
After incubating for 3 h at 0°C, the<br>
membranes are recovered by filtration through Whatman<br>
GF/B™ filters washed with 2 times 4.5 ml of cold (0°C)<br>
incubation buffer. The amount of radioactivity retained<br>
by the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy.<br>
For each concentration of studied compound,<br>
the percentage of inhibition of the binding of<br>
[3H]Ro5-4864 is determined and then the IC50<br>
concentration, the concentration which inhibits 50% of<br>
the specific binding, is determined.<br>
The IC50 values of the most active compounds<br>
of the invention exhibit values ranging from 1 nM to<br>
200 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention are therefore<br>
ligands with an affinity for peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptors.<br>
Study of the neurotrophic activity-<br>
Test of survival of the motor neurones after sectioning<br>
the facial nerve in rats aged 4 days<br>
After lesion of the facial nerve in immature<br>
rats, the motor neurones of the facial nucleus<br>
experience neuronal death by apoptosis. Neuronal<br>
survival is evaluated using neuronal counting and<br>
histological methods.<br>
Immature rats aged 4 days are anaesthetized<br>
with pentobarbital (3 mg/kg by the i.p. route). The<br>
right facial nerve is exposed and sectioned at its<br>
outlet from the stylomastoid foramen. After waking up,<br>
the young rats are returned to their mothers and are<br>
treated for 7 days with one or two daily<br>
administrations, by the oral or intraperitoneal route,<br>
at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg.<br>
7 days after the lesion, the animals are<br>
decapitated and the brains are frozen in isopentane at<br>
-40°C. The entire facial nerve is cut with a cryostat<br>
into sections with a width of 10 µm. The motor neurones<br>
are stained with cresyl violet and counted using the<br>
Histo™ software (Biocom™) .<br>
In this model, the compounds of the invention<br>
increase neuronal survival by approximately 10 to 30%.<br>
The results of the tests show that the most<br>
active compounds of the invention promote nerve<br>
regeneration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can therefore<br>
participate in the composition of a medicament.<br>
They can be used for the preparation of<br>
medicaments intended for the prevention and/or<br>
treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathies,<br>
such as traumatic or ischaemic neuropathies,<br>
infectious, alcoholic, medicinal or genetic<br>
neuropathies, and motor neurone conditions, such as<br>
spinal amyotrophies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br>
These medicaments will also find an application in the<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the central<br>
nervous system, either of acute type, such as strokes<br>
and cranial and medullar traumas, or of chronic type,<br>
such as autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis),<br>
Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinson"s disease and any other<br>
disease in which the administration of neurotrophic<br>
factors is supposed to have a therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be<br>
used for the preparation of medicaments intended for<br>
the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety, of epilepsy<br>
and of sleep disorders. This is because ligands of the<br>
PBR or p sites stimulate the production of<br>
neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone, dehydroeplandro-<br>
sterone and 3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one, by promoting<br>
the transfer of cholesterol from the outside to the<br>
inside of the mitochondrial membrane. These<br>
neurosteroids modulate the activity of the GABAA-<br>
chloride channel macromolecular complex and can thus<br>
produce anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative<br>
activities (D. Bitran et al., Psychopharmacology, 2000,<br>
151, 64-71; S. Okuyama et al., Life Sci., 1999, 64<br>
(16), 1455-1464; L.D. McCauley et al., Eur. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 1995, 276, 145-153; S.K. Kulkarni et al.,<br>
Drugs of Today, 1995, 31, 433-4558).<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be<br>
used in the treatment of acute or chronic renal<br>
insufficiency, of glomerulonephritis, of diabetic<br>
nephropathy, of cardiac ischaemia and cardiac<br>
insufficiency, of myocardial infarction, of ischaemia<br>
of the lower limbs, of coronary vasospasm, of angina<br>
pectoris, of pathologies associated with the heart<br>
valves, of inflammatory heart diseases, of side effects<br>
due to cardiotoxic medicaments or as a result of heart<br>
surgery, of atherosclerosis and of its thromboembolic<br>
complications, of restenosis, of graft rejections, or<br>
of conditions related to incorrect proliferation or<br>
incorrect migration of smooth muscle cells.<br>
Furthermore, recent data in the literature<br>
indicate that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br>
receptor might play a fundamental role in the<br>
regulation of eel] proliferation and cancerization<br>
processes. Generally, and in comparison with normal<br>
tissues, an increased density of peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptors is observed in various types<br>
of tumours and cancers.<br>
In human astrocytomas, the level of<br>
expression of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br>
receptor is correlated with the degree of malignancy of<br>
the tumour, the proliferation index and the survival of<br>
the patients. In human cerebral tumours, the increase<br>
in the number of peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br>
receptors is used as a diagnostic indication in medical<br>
imaging and as a therapeutic target for conjugates<br>
formed from a ligand of the peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptor and from a cytostatic drug. A<br>
high density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br>
receptors is also observed in ovarian carcinomas and<br>
breast cancers. As regards the latter, it has been<br>
demonstrated that the level of expression of the<br>
peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is related to<br>
the aggressive potential of the tumour; furthermore,<br>
the presence of a peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br>
receptor agonist stimulates the growth of a mammary<br>
cancer line.<br>
These combined results, which suggest a<br>
deleterious function of the peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptor in cancerization processes,<br>
constitute a relevant basis for the search for<br>
synthetic ligands specific for the peripheral-type<br>
benzodiazepine receptor which are capable of blocking<br>
the effects thereof.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used for the<br>
treatment of tumours and cancers.<br>
The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors<br>
are also present in the skin and, in this respect, the<br>
compounds which can be used according to the invention<br>
can be used for the prophylaxis or the treatment of<br>
cutaneous stress.<br>
The term "cutaneous stress" is understood to<br>
mean the various situations which might cause damage,<br>
in particular to the epidermis, whatever the agent<br>
which causes this stress. This agent can be internal<br>
and/or external to the body, such as a chemical or<br>
free-radical agent, or else external, such as<br>
ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Thus, the compounds which can be used<br>
according to the invention are intended to prevent and<br>
to combat cutaneous irritation, dry patches, erythemas,<br>
dysaesthetic sensations, heating sensations, pruritus<br>
of the skin and/or mucous membranes, or ageing, and can<br>
also be used in cutaneous disorders, such as, for<br>
example, psoriasis, pruriginous diseases, herpes,<br>
photodermatoses, atopic dermatitides, contact<br>
dermatitides, lichens, prurigo, pruritus, insect<br>
stings, in fibroses and other disorders of collagen<br>
maturation, in immunological disorders or in<br>
dermatological conditions, such as eczema.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be<br>
used for the prevention and treatment of chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases, in particular rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, in<br>
particular asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome<br>
(ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases<br>
(COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary diseases,<br>
lung diseases or pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
Thus, a subject-matter of the invention is<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective<br>
dose of at least one compoimd of general formula (I),<br>
in the form of the base, of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvate or of a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate, as<br>
a mixture, if appropriate, with suitable excipients.<br>
The said excipients are chosen according to<br>
the pharmaceutical form and the method of<br>
administration desired.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention may thus be intended for oral, sublingual,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical,<br>
intratracheal, intranasal, transdermal, rectal or<br>
intraocular administration.<br>
The unit administration forms can be, for<br>
example, tablets, gelatin capsules, granules, powders,<br>
solutions or suspensions to be taken orally or to be<br>
injected, transdermal patches or suppositories.<br>
Ointments, lotions and collyria can be envisaged for<br>
topical administration.<br>
The said unit forms are dosed to allow a<br>
daily administration of 0.001 to 20 mg of active<br>
principle per kg of body weight, according to the<br>
pharmaceutical dosage form.<br>
To prepare tablets, a pharmaceutical vehicle,<br>
which can be composed of diluents, such as, for<br>
example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or starch,<br>
and formulation adjuvants, such as binders<br>
(polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
and the like) , flow agents,, such as silica, or<br>
lubricants, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid,<br>
glyceryl tribehenate or sodium stearylfumarate, is<br>
added to the micronized or unmicronized active<br>
principle. Wetting or surface-active agents, such as<br>
sodium lauryl sulphate, can also be added.<br>
The preparation techniques can be direct<br>
tableting, dry granulation, wet granulation or hot<br>
melt.<br>
The tablets can be bare, coated with sugar,<br>
for example with sucrose, or coated with various<br>
polymers or other appropriate materials. They can be<br>
designed to make possible rapid, delayed or sustained<br>
release of the active principle by virtue of polymer<br>
matrices or of specific polymers used in the coating.<br>
To prepare gelatin capsules, the active<br>
principle is mixed with dry pharmaceutical vehicles<br>
(simple mixing, dry or wet granulation, or hot melt) or<br>
liquid or semisolid pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
The gelatin capsules can be hard or soft and<br>
coated or uncoated with a thin film, so as to have a<br>
rapid, sustained or delayed activity (for example, for<br>
an enteric form).<br>
A composition in the form of a syrup or an<br>
elixir or for administration in the form of drops can<br>
comprise the active principle in conjunction with a<br>
sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener,<br>
methylparaben or propylparaben, as antiseptic, a<br>
flavour enhancer and a colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible powders and granules<br>
can comprise the active principle as a mixture with<br>
dispersing agents or wetting agents, or dispersing<br>
agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with<br>
sweeteners and flavour-correcting agents.<br>
Recourse is had, for rectal administration,<br>
to suppositories prepared with binders which melt at<br>
the rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
Use is made, for parenteral administration,<br>
of aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or<br>
sterile solutions which are injectable comprising<br>
pharmacologically compatible dispersing agents and/or<br>
wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or<br>
butylene glycol.<br>
The active principle can also be formulated<br>
in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or<br>
more carriers or additives, or else with a polymer<br>
matrix or with a cyclodextrin (transdermal patches or<br>
sustained release forms).<br>
The topical compositions according to the<br>
invention comprise a medium compatible with the skin.<br>
They can be provided in particular in the form of<br>
aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous/alcoholic solutions, of<br>
gels, of water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions having<br>
the appearance of a cream or of a gel, of<br>
microemulsions or of aerosols or in the form of<br>
vesicular dispersions comprising ionic and/or nonionic<br>
lipids. These pharmaceutical dosage forms are prepared<br>
according to methods conventional in the fields under<br>
consideration.<br>
