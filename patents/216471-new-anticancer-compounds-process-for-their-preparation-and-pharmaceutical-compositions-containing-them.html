The compounds of the present invention either alone or in combination with other cytotoxic durgs exhibited significant in vitro anti-tumor activity against a wide range of human tumor cell lines.<br>
Back ground of the Invention<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for cell proliferation diseases such as psoriasis and cancer utilize compounds, which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to cells generally. But their toxic effects on rapidly dividing cells such as tumor cells can be benefiC1al. Alternative approaches such as antiproliferative agents which act by mechanisms other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action.<br>
In recent years it has been discovered that a cell become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene. Several such oncogenes give rises to the production of peptides which are receptors for growth factors. The growth factor receptor complex subsequently leads to an increase in cell proliferation. Regardless of the nature of surface receptors protein kinases and phosphotases along with phospholipases or essential machinery by which cell signal is transmitted within the cell (Marshall J C, Cell 80, 179-278, 1995).<br>
Mammalian cells use diverse signaling pathways to instruct the nucleus about genes to turn on and off in the regulation of cell growth and cell cycling. Extra cellular signals received at transemembrane receptors are relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et al., SC1ence 257, 1335, 1992), which have been implicated in a wide array of<br><br>
" physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis<br>
(Davis et.al., J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14553, 1993). The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)<br>
pathway (Raf-MEK-ERK phosphorylation cascade ) is a key signaling pathway linking<br>
signals from growth factors at cell surface receptors to transcription factors in the nucleus<br>
which control gene expression and function (Nishida et.al.. Trends Biochem. SC1., 19, 236,<br>
1994). This pathway also serves oncogenic signals in cancer cells by linking signals from<br>
membrane receptor oncogenes and intracellular oncogenic kinases to the nucleus. Ras is an<br>
upstream activator of MAPK pathway and oncogenic forms of Ras are known. Ras is mutated<br>
in roughly in 30% of all human solid tumors, including 50 % of colon cancers and 90% of all<br>
. pancreatic cancers (Bos J.L., et. al Cancer Res. 49, 4682, 1989; Kiaris, H. et. al.. Int. J. Oncol.<br>
7, 413, 1995). Very recently mutations of Raf (Nature, 417, 2002) also have been shown in<br>
human tumors. Over expression, hyperactivity or dysregulation of c-Raf (Callans, L. S., et.<br>
al., Annu. Surg. Oncol. 2, 38, 1995; El-Ashry, D., et. al.. Oncogene, 15, 423, and 1997) has<br>
been shown to be assoC1ated with various human cancers and tumor cells. MEK (MAP kinase)<br>
and ERK (MAP kinase) are dysregulated in human cancers (Oka, H., et. al., Cancer Res.,<br>
55, 4182, 1995; Sivaraman, V. S., et al.,	J. Clin. Invest. 99, 1478, 1997) and over<br>
activation ofc-Raf is assoC1ated with dysregulated ERK and MEK in human tumors and tumor cell lines (Hoshino et al.. Oncogene, 18, 813, 1999).<br>
Thus, inhibitor of the MAPK pathway through inhibition of Raf, MEK or ERK offers a unique opportunity to block uncontrolled cell growth and therefore, has potential therapeutic utility in developing cancer agents (Stein, B et al., Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 31, 289, 1996; Levitt, M.L., et al.. Invest. New Drugs 17, 213, 1999)<br>
Certain quinazoline compounds (WO09609294, WO09615118, WO09609294, WO09906378, WO0051587, WO00104111, WO00121594), cyanoquinolines (WO09843960, US 6,002,008) have been reported as kinase inhibitors.<br>
