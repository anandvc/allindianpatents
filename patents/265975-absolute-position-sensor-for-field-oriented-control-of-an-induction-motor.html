ABSOLUTE POSITION SENSOR FOR FIELD-ORIENTED<br>
CONTROL OF AN INDUCTION MOTOR<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001]       This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/954,096, filed August 6, 2007, and<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to vehicle drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments of the<br>
subject matter relate to absolute position sensing for field-oriented control of<br>
induction motors.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles. Many of these vehicles use<br>
electric motors to provide traction power to the vehicle.<br>
[0004] For induction motors, the speed of the rotor and the speed of the<br>
rotating magnetic field in the stator must be different, a concept known as slip,<br>
in order to induce current. In order to operate the induction motor at its<br>
highest efficiency, the slip is controlled using feedback control loops. In<br>
conventional control systems, as the rotor speed increases, the rotor<br>
approaches a base speed (or rated speed), where the voltage across the motor<br>
terminals reaches a value at which no more current can be provided to the<br><br>
motor. In order to operate the motor at higher speeds than the base speed, a<br>
technique known as flux weakening, controlled by non-torque generating<br>
current is employed.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, field-oriented control methods have been developed<br>
to control the torque generating current supplied to the induction motor<br>
separately from the non-torque generating current. These methods use the<br>
relative position and speed of the rotor to maintain a desired relationship<br>
between the stator flux and rotor flux. The non-torque generating current is<br>
adjusted based on the speed of the rotor and the flux characteristics of the<br>
induction motor. By compensating for the undesired flux, field-oriented<br>
control can be used to improve efficiency, the motor transient response, and<br>
tracking of the torque command at speeds higher than the base speed. As a<br>
result of the improved performance, induction motors and drive systems may<br>
be appropriately sized for an application, thereby lowering cost and improving<br>
overall efficiency.<br>
[0006] Most field-oriented control methods for induction motors utilize<br>
incremental encoders to measure the relative position and speed of the rotor.<br>
Typically, these encoders are either magnetic or optical. For automotive<br>
environments, packaging space is often at a premium and the encoders are<br>
often exposed to demanding environmental conditions. For example, the<br>
operating temperature may range from -40° C to 150° C, which exceeds the<br>
operating temperature ratings for most optical encoders. While magnetic<br>
encoders may be able to tolerate automotive temperatures, they often cannot<br>
sustain operation when exposed to vibration forces and frequencies<br>
encountered in automotive applications. Furthermore, in order to achieve<br>
high-levels of accuracy, magnetic encoders must be implemented in a large<br>
physical size, which is undesirable from a packaging and automotive design<br>
perspective.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0007] An apparatus is provided for an automotive drive system. The<br>
automotive drive system comprises an induction motor having a rotor, and a<br>
position sensor coupled to the induction motor. The position sensor is<br>
configured to sense the absolute angular position of the rotor. A processor<br>
may be coupled to the position sensor and configured to determine the relative<br>
angular position of the rotor based on a difference between the absolute<br>
angular position and an initial angular position obtained when the induction<br>
motor is started. A controller may be coupled to the induction motor and the<br>
processor and configured to provide field-oriented control of the induction<br>
motor based on the relative angular position of the rotor.<br>
[0008] An apparatus is provided for a drive system for use in a vehicle.<br>
The drive system comprises an induction motor having a rotor, and a position<br>
sensor integrated with the induction motor. The position sensor is configured<br>
to sense the absolute angular position of the rotor. The position sensor may<br>
further comprise a resolver having a resolver rotor coupled to a shaft of the<br>
induction motor, and a resolver stator coupled to the induction motor.<br>
[0009] A method is provided for controlling an induction motor. The<br>
method comprises obtaining an initial angular position of the rotor using an<br>
absolute position sensor, wherein the initial angular position of the rotor is<br>
obtained when the induction motor is started. The method further comprises<br>
obtaining a subsequent angular position of the rotor using the absolute position<br>
sensor. The method comprises determining a relative angular position of the<br>
rotor based on the initial angular position and the subsequent angular position,<br>
and determining a magnetizing current command based on the relative angular<br>
position.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the<br>
application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word<br>
"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.<br>
Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied<br>
theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary<br>
or the following detailed description.<br>
[0017] The following description refers to elements or nodes or features<br>
being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly<br>
stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly<br>
joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise,<br>
"coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined<br><br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature,<br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematics shown<br>
herein depict exemplary arrangements of elements, additional intervening<br>
elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment<br>
of the depicted subject matter. Furthermore, the terms "first", "second" and<br>
other such numerical terms referring to structures do not imply a sequence or<br>
order unless clearly indicated by the context.<br>
[0018] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to<br>
signaling, sensors, and other functional aspects of the systems (and the<br>
individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in<br>
detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures<br>
contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships<br>
and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted<br>
that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical<br>
connections may be present in an embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0019] Technologies and concepts discussed herein relate to systems and<br>
methods for implementing field-oriented control of induction motors using<br>
absolute position sensors. Field-oriented control involves separate current<br>
control loops for the torque generating current and the non-torque generating<br>
current supplied to the induction motor. The relative position and speed of the<br>
rotor is used to maintain a desired relationship between the stator flux and<br>
rotor flux to improve motor efficiency, as described in greater detail below.<br>
As used herein, subscripts d and q are quantities in the Cartesian frame of<br>
reference synchronous with the rotation of a rotor within an induction motor,<br>
where the q axis (or quadrature axis) is orthogonal to the rotor pole axis (i.e.,<br>
torque generating) and the d axis (or direct axis) is parallel to the rotor pole<br>
axis (i.e., non-torque generating).<br>
[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle, or automobile 100, in accordance with<br>
one embodiment, which includes an induction motor 102, an energy source<br>
104, an inverter assembly 106, an electronic control system 108, and a drive<br>
shaft 110. In an exemplary embodiment, the energy source 104 is in operable<br><br>
communication and/or electrically coupled to the electronic control system<br>
108 and the inverter assembly 106. The inverter assembly 106 is coupled to<br>
the induction motor 102, which in turn is coupled to the drive shaft 110. The<br>
inverter assembly 106 is in operable communication and/or electrically<br>
coupled to the electronic control system 108 and is configured to provide<br>
electrical energy and/or power from the energy source 104 to the induction<br>
motor 102 as discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0021] Depending on the embodiment, the automobile 100 may be any<br>
one of a number of different types of automobiles, such as, for example, a<br>
sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-<br>
wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel<br>
drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive (AWD). The automobile 100 may also<br>
incorporate any one of, or combination of, a number of different types of<br>
engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a<br>
"flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and<br>
alcohol), a fuel cell vehicle engine, a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and<br>
natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, or an<br>
electric motor.<br>
[0022] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the induction<br>
motor 102 may comprise a generator, a traction motor, or another suitable<br>
motor known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor<br>
102 is a multi-phase alternating current (AC) motor and includes a set of<br>
windings (or coils), wherein each winding corresponds to one phase of the<br>
induction motor 102, Although not illustrated in FIG. 1, the induction motor<br>
102 includes a stator assembly (or stator), and a rotor assembly (or rotor), as<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
induction motor 102 may also include a transmission integrated therein such<br>
that the induction motor 102 and the transmission are mechanically coupled to<br>
at least some of the wheels through one or more drive shafts 110.<br>
[0023] Depending on the embodiment, the energy source 104 may<br>
comprise a battery, a fuel cell, or another suitable voltage source. It should be<br><br>
understood that although FIG. 1 depicts an automobile 100 having one energy<br>
source 104, the principles and subject matter discussed herein are independent<br>
of the number or type of energy source, and apply to vehicles having any<br>
number of energy sources.<br>
[0024] In an exemplary embodiment, the inverter assembly 106 includes<br>
one or more inverters, each including switches (e.g., semiconductor devices,<br>
such as transistors and/or switches) with antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to<br>
each switch), with windings of the induction motor 102 electrically connected<br>
between the switches to provide voltage and create torque in the induction<br>
motor 102, as will be understood in the art. The electronic control system 108<br>
is in operable communication and/or electrically connected to the inverter<br>
assembly 106. Although not shown in detail, the electronic control system<br>
108 includes various sensors and automotive control modules, or electronic<br>
control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control module for controlling the<br>
inverter assembly 106, and may further include a processor and/or a memory<br>
which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable<br>
medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as described below.<br>
[0025] In accordance with one embodiment, the electronic control system<br>
108 is responsive to commands received from the driver of the automobile 100<br>
(i.e. via an accelerator pedal) and provides commands to the inverter assembly<br>
106 to utilize high frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) to manage the<br>
voltage provided to the induction motor 102 by the inverter assembly 106, as<br>
will be understood. In an exemplary embodiment, the electronic control<br>
system 108 implements a field-oriented control loop to operate the inverter<br>
assembly 106 and improve the efficiency and performance of the induction<br>
motor 102, as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, an<br>
induction motor control system 200 includes, without limitation, an induction<br>
motor 102, an energy source 104, a controller 202, an inverter 204, an absolute<br>
position sensor 206, and a processor 208. Some elements of FIG. 2 are similar<br>
to their counterpart elements described above in reference to FIG. 1, and such<br><br>
description will not be redundantly repeated in the context of FIG. 2. The<br>
induction motor control system 200 may be configured to utilize field-oriented<br>
control to regulate the induction motor 102 based on the rotor position, as<br>
described in greater detail below. For example, the induction motor control<br>
system 200 may be configured to implement field-oriented control methods,<br>
such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,222,335 entitled "METHOD OF<br>
CONTROLLING A VOLTAGE-FED INDUCTION MACHINE", assigned to<br>
the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein,<br>
which discloses an exemplary method for implementing field-oriented control<br>
based on relative position of a rotor for an induction motor.<br>
[0027] Referring again to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the energy<br>
source 104 is coupled to the inverter 204, which in turn is coupled to the<br>
induction motor 102. The absolute position sensor 206 is coupled to the<br>
induction motor 102. The processor 208 is coupled between the output of the<br>
absolute position sensor 206 and the controller 202. The controller 202 is<br>
coupled to the inverter 204, and is configured to provide duty cycle commands<br>
to the inverter 204. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 202 is further<br>
coupled to the output of the inverter 204 and the output of the processor 208 to<br>
create a feedback control loop for implementing field-oriented control as<br>
discussed in greater detail below. The three lines between the inverter 204 and<br>
the induction motor 102 indicate that the induction motor 102 and the inverter<br>
204 have three phases, although the subject matter described herein is not<br>
limited to a three-phase implementation, and applies to inverters 204 and<br>
induction motors 102 having any number of phases, as will be appreciated in<br>
the art.<br>
[002S] In an exemplary embodiment, the absolute position sensor 206<br>
provides information or signals representative of the absolute angular position<br>
of the rotor. The absolute position sensor 206 may be configured to sense or<br>
measure the absolute angular position of the rotor of the induction motor 102<br>
relative to the stator or some other fixed reference point based on the<br>
positioning of the absolute position sensor 206. In an exemplary embodiment,<br><br>
the absolute position sensor 206 is a resolver, although other suitable means<br>
for sensing absolute angular position may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a resolver having two pole pairs (e.g., two-pole<br>
resolver) is used. In alternative embodiments, multipole resolvers may be<br>
used, however, multipole resolvers are generally more costly and require<br>
additional mathematical computations to be implemented, which are known in<br>
the art and beyond the scope of this disclosure. The resolver is capable of<br>
producing accurate position information even while being packaged and<br>
designed for compact size. Additionally, resolvers are highly durable and can<br>
sustain reliable and accurate operation in the presence of demanding<br>
environmental conditions (e.g., automotive temperature and vibration levels).<br>
[0029] In an exemplary embodiment, the processor 208 is coupled to the<br>
absolute position sensor 206 and is configured to convert the signals (analog<br>
signals in the case of a resolver) or measurements from the absolute position<br>
sensor 206 to a digital representation (e.g., digital word). The processor 208<br>
may be a resolver-to-digital converter or another suitable means for processing<br>
signals from the absolute position sensor 206. The processor 208 may be<br>
configured to perform additional tasks and functions, as described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
[0030] In an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control system<br>
200 may further include a current calculator 210. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the output of the current calculator 210 is coupled to an input of<br>
the controller 202, and the current calculator 210 is configured to provide a<br>
torque producing current command (i*q) to the controller 202. The current<br>
calculator 210 may determine the torque producing current command in<br>
response to a torque command (Te*) (e.g., provided by the electronic control<br>
system 108), an estimated rotor flux (Φr), and a commanded rotor flux (Φ*r),<br>
as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0031] In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 202 is configured to<br>
control the voltage provided by the energy source 104 to the induction motor<br><br>
102 by utilizing PWM techniques to regulate the output of the inverter 204, as<br>
will be understood. The controller 202 is configured to utilize information<br>
regarding the relative position of the rotor of the induction motor 102 to<br>
implement field-oriented control. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller<br>
202 may further include, without limitation, a speed observer 212, a flux<br>
reference table 214, a magnetizing current estimator 216, a synchronous frame<br>
current regulator 218, a stationary coordinate transformer 220, a space vector<br>
modulator 222, a synchronous coordinate transformer 224, a flux estimator<br>
and slip angle calculator 226, and an adder 228. These and other elements<br>
may be coupled together to implement field-oriented control of the induction<br>
motor 102 based on the relative rotor position, as described in greater detail<br>
below.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIG. 3, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
induction motor control system 200 may be configured to perform an<br>
induction motor control process 300 and additional tasks, functions, and<br>
operations described below. The various tasks may be performed by software,<br>
hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the<br>
following description may refer to elements mentioned above in connection<br>
with FIGS. 1-2. In practice, the tasks, functions, and operations may be<br>
performed by different elements of the described system, such as the<br>
electronic control system 108, controller 202 or the processor 208. It should<br>
be appreciated any number of additional or alternative tasks may be included,<br>
and may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process<br>
having additional functionality not described in detail herein.<br>
[0033] Referring again to FIG. 3, and with continued reference to FIG. 1<br>
and FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control<br>
process 300 may be configured to initialize when the induction motor 102 is<br>
started. In an exemplary embodiment, the absolute position sensor 206<br>
obtains an initial angular position of the rotor when the induction motor 102<br>
is started (task 302). The induction motor control process 300 may be<br>
configured to store the initial angular position (task 304).  For example, the<br><br>
processor 208 may be configured to store or maintain the initial angular<br>
position in memory. The absolute position sensor 206 obtains a subsequent<br>
angular position of the rotor during operation of the induction motor 102 as<br>
the rotor rotates (task 306).<br>
[0034] In an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control process<br>
300 is configured to determine the relative angular position (θr) of the rotor<br>
based on the absolute angular position (task 308). The induction motor<br>
control process 300 may determine a relative angular position of the rotor<br>
based on a difference between the subsequent angular position and the initial<br>
angular position. For example, the processor 208 may be configured to store<br>
the initial angular position of the rotor as an offset, and subtract the initial<br>
angular position from each subsequent angular position measurement to<br>
produce a relative angular position (e.g., relative to the initial angular<br>
position or angular position at startup). In alternative embodiments, the<br>
controller 202 may be configured to receive the absolute angular position and<br>
determine the relative angular position. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
induction motor control process 300 is configured to provide the relative<br>
angular position to a field-oriented control system (e.g., controller 202). For<br>
example, the output of the processor 208 may be coupled to an input of the<br>
controller 202.<br>
[0035] In an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control process<br>
300 is configured to determine the speed of the rotor (ωr) based on the<br>
relative position (task 310). For example, the processor 208 may coupled to<br>
and/or provide the relative rotor position information to the speed observer<br>
212. The speed observer 212 may be configured to determine the rotor<br>
speed by differentiating the relative rotor position with respect to time. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control process 300 utilizes the<br>
rotor speed to determine a magnetizing current command (i*d) to compensate<br>
for transient changes in rotor flux based on the rotor speed (task 312).  For<br><br>
example, the speed observer 212 may provide the rotor speed to the input of<br>
the flux reference table 214, which obtains a rotor flux command (Φ*r). In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the flux reference table 214 is a lookup<br>
table containing predetermined rotor flux commands (Φ*r) based on the rotor<br>
speed (ωr), the voltage of the energy source 104 (VDC), and the flux<br>
characteristics of the induction motor 102. The output of the flux reference<br>
table 214 may be provided to the magnetizing current estimator 216, which is<br>
configured to determine the magnetizing current command (i*d) to produce the<br>
desired rotor flux based on the rotor flux command (Φ*r).<br>
[0036] In an exemplary embodiment, the induction motor control process<br>
300 is configured to determine a duty cycle for inverter 204 based on the<br>
relative position of the rotor and the synchronous frame current commands<br>
(i*d,i*q) (task 314). The synchronous frame current regulator 218 may be<br>
coupled to the current calculator 210 and the magnetizing current estimator<br>
216, such that it receives the synchronous frame current commands (i*d,i*q).<br>
The synchronous frame current regulator 218 may be coupled to the output of<br>
the synchronous coordinate transformer 224. The synchronous coordinate<br>
transformer 224 is coupled to the output of the inverter 204 and configured to<br>
measure (or sense) the current in the induction motor 102. The synchronous<br>
coordinate transformer 224 performs a coordinate transformation to obtain the<br>
value of the measured currents in the synchronous reference frame (id, iq) and<br>
provides the measured currents to the synchronous frame current regulator<br>
218. The synchronous frame current regulator 218 is configured to determine<br>
synchronous frame duly cycles (d*d,d*q) such that the measured currents<br>
(id, iq) track the current commands (i*d, i*q).<br>
[0037] In an exemplary embodiment, the stationary coordinate transformer<br>
220 is coupled to the output of the synchronous frame current regulator 218<br>
and the output of the adder 228.    The adder 228 is coupled to the flux<br><br>
estimator and slip angle calculator 226, which is configured to receive as<br>
inputs the measured current (id, iq), commanded current (i*d, i*q), and the rotor<br>
flux command Φ*r), and from those inputs determine an estimated rotor flux<br>
(Φr) and an optimized slip angle (θslip), as will be appreciated in the art. The<br>
adder 228 is also configured to receive the relative rotor position (θr) and add<br>
the relative rotor position and the slip angle (θsllp) to produce a<br>
transformation angle (θt). In an exemplary embodiment, the stationary<br>
coordinate transformer 220 is configured to convert the synchronous frame<br>
duty cycle commands (d*d, d*q) to the stationary frame (da,d) based on the<br>
transformation angle (θt). In an exemplary embodiment, the output of the<br>
stationary coordinate transformer 220 is coupled to the input of the space<br>
vector modulator 222. The space vector modulator 222 is configured to<br>
determine operative duty cycle commands for the switches of the inverter 204<br>
based on the stationary frame duty cycle commands, such that the inverter 204<br>
utilizes PWM modulation to provide voltage from the energy source 104 to<br>
operate the induction motor 102 as desired. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
loop defined by task 306, task 308, task 310, task 312, and task 314 repeats<br>
indefinitely during operation of the induction motor 102.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, an<br>
induction motor automotive drive system 400 includes, without limitation, an<br>
induction motor 102 integrated with an absolute position sensor 206. FIG. 4<br>
illustrates a cross-sectional view of the induction motor drive system 400<br>
taken down a center of a rotating shaft. The induction motor 102 comprises a<br>
shaft 402 concentric with a rotor 404 encased in a housing 406. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the absolute position sensor 206 is a resolver having a<br>
resolver rotor 408 and a resolver stator 410.<br>
[0039] In an exemplary embodiment, the shaft 402 is mechanically<br>
coupled to the rotor 404, such that the shaft 402 rotates synchronously with the<br>
rotor 404. In an exemplary embodiment, the shaft 402 has length such that a<br><br>
portion of the shaft 402 extends beyond the rotor 404 and through a gap in the<br>
housing 406. The resolver rotor 408 is mechanically coupled to the shaft 402<br>
(e.g., by bolting the resolver rotor 408 to the shaft 402). In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the shaft 402 is concentric with the resolver rotor 408. The<br>
resolver stator 410 may be mechanically coupled to the housing 406 and<br>
concentric with the resolver rotor 408. The resolver stator 410 is configured to<br>
sense the absolute angular position of the rotor 404 based on the angular<br>
position of the resolver rotor 408, which tracks the angular position of the<br>
rotor 404 via the mechanical coupling to the shaft 402, as will be understood<br>
in the art.<br>
[0040] The systems and/or methods described above provide a field-<br>
oriented control system for induction motors using absolute position sensors.<br>
Because field-oriented control systems for induction motors are designed for<br>
incremental or relative position measurements, implementing an absolute<br>
position sensor (such as a resolver) is more complex than using an incremental<br>
encoder. However, the space savings exceed the additional implementation<br>
costs. Additionally, resolvers are durable can be reliably used in demanding<br>
environments where incremental encoders are less reliable. As described<br>
above, the performance of the motor is not impaired and the field-oriented<br>
control of the induction motor may be achieved without modifying existing<br>
control systems, even though a relative position sensor is not used.<br>
[0041] Other embodiments may utilize system and method described<br>
above in different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and<br>
aircraft), or in different electrical systems altogether, as it may be<br>
implemented in any situation where an induction motor is operated using<br>
field-oriented control. Further, the motor and the inverters may have different<br>
numbers of phases, and the systems described herein should not be construed<br>
as limited to a three-phase design. The basic principles discussed herein may<br>
be extended to higher-order phase systems as will be understood in the art.<br>
[0042] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br><br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
