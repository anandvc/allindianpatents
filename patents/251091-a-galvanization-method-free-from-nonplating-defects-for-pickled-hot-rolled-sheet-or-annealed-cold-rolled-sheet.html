				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD <br>
The present invention relates to a galvanization method free from nonplating defects for pickled hot-rolled steel sheet or annealed cold-rolled steel sheet as a plating sheet.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hot dip galvanized steel sheet is superior in corrosion resistance, so is used for automobiles, household electric appliances, building materials, and other various types of applications. In the past, building material applications were the mainstream, but progress in operating technology has enabled dross-based defects in appearance to be greatly reduced, so the sheet is being used in large volumes even in automobiles and household electric appliances where demands on the quality of the appearance are tough. As a result, there are also diverse types of plating sheets used. Further, hot dip galvannealized steel sheet obtained by heat treating hot dip galvanized steel sheet is superior in weldability compared with hot dip galvanized steel sheet, so is being used in large volumes particularly for automobiles.<br>
In this regard, Japanese Patent No. 2517169 discloses a method of utilizing the Ni preplating method to produce hot dip galvanized stedl sheet superior in plating adhesion and corrosion resistance of worked parts, but this could not provide optimum plating conditions for all of the above wide range of plating sheets.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has as its object the provision of a galvanization method advantageous in<br>
terms of production cost and free from nonplating defects no matter what the plating sheet by using an Ni preplating method.<br>
The inventors engaged in study and as a result clarified that in a galvanization method using an Ni 'preplating method for hot-rolled steel sheet or cold-rolled steel sheet as a plating sheet, adjustment of the amount of Ni preplating in accordance with the plating sheet is required for hot dip galvanization free from nonplating defects. More specifically, in a galvanization method for pickled hot-rolled steel sheet or annealed cold-rolled steel sheet as a plating sheet, when cleaning the surface of said plating sheet, preplating it by Ni, rapidly heating it in a nonoxidizing or reducing atmosphere to a sheet temperature of 430 to 500°C by a rate of temperature rise of 20°C/sec or more, then hot dip plating it in a galvanization bath,<br>
1)	when the plating sheet is a pickled hot-rolled<br>
steel sheet and the Si is contained as a steel sheet<br>
ingredient in an amount of 0.2% or more^ making the<br>
amount of Ni preplating 0.5 g/m2 or more,<br>
2)	when the plating sheet is a pickled hot-rolled<br>
steel sheet and Si is contained as a steel sheet<br>
ingredient in an amount less than 0.2%, making the amount<br>
of Ni preplating 0.2 g/m2 or more,<br>
3)	when the plating sheet is an annealed cold-<br>
rolled steel sheet and Si is contained as a steel sheet<br>
ingredient in an amount of 0.2% or more, making the<br>
amount of Ni preplating 0.3 g/m2 or more,<br>
4)	when the plating sheet is an annealed cold-<br>
rolled steel sheet and Si is contained as a steel sheet<br>
ingredient in an amount less than 0.2%, making the amount<br>
of Ni preplating 0.05 g/m2 or more<br>
is necessary for hot dip galvanization free from nonplating defects. This method can also be applied to various types of alloy plating including Zn.<br>
According to the present invention, it becomes<br><br>
possible to hot dip galvanize any hot-rolled steel sheet, cold-rolled steel sheet, or plating sheet having various types of ingredients without any nonplating defects.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 shows the desirable range of the amount of deposition of Ni preplating in the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR WORKING THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, both hot-rolled steel sheet and cold-rolled steel sheet are used as plating sheets. "Hot-rolled steel sheet" includes steel sheet not in a state with the surface layer having residual scale (so-called "black oxide material"), but with scale removed by pickling treatment. "Cold-rolled steel sheet" includes both cold rolled but not yet annealed materials and annealed materials, but as explained later, the pretreatment for hot dip galvanization of the present invention cannot anneal unannealed materials, so there is no meaning in covering cold rolled but not yet annealed materials by the present invention unless there is some special need. "Cold rolled annealed materials" include all materials produced by known methods, but steel sheet cooled utilizing water such as so-called "water vaporization cooling" has residual scale on the surface layer, so the sheet is preferably one from which scale is removed by pickling.<br>
According to the present invention, by adjusting the amount of Ni preplating, any of the above plating sheets can be hot dip galvanized well without nonplating defects. As pretreatment for the Ni preplating in the present invention, treatment to clean away surface dirt, oxide film, etc. is necessary. As this method, alkali degreasing and pickling treatment are preferably performed in that order.<br>
In the present invention, the amount of Ni preplating differs according to the plating sheet. This will be explained specifically below. First, when the plating sheet is pickled hot-rolled steel sheet, the<br><br>
amount of Ni preplating has to be 0.2 g/m2 or more. If less than this, nonplating results. Further, hot-rolled steel sheet where the steel contains Si in an amount of 0.2% or more is more susceptible to nonplating, so the amount of Ni preplating has to be 0.5 g/m2 or more. Next, in the case of cold-rolled steel sheet, the amount of Ni preplating has to be 0.05 g/m2 or more. If less than this, nonplating results. Further, cold-rolled steel sheet where the steel contains Si in an amount of 0.2% or more is also more susceptible to nonplating, so the amount of Ni preplating has to be 0.3 g/m2 or more. The upper limit of the amount of Ni preplating is not particularly limited, but from the viewpoint of the cost, a lower amount is preferable, so it is preferable to make as the upper limit the conditions where the above-mentioned lower limit value is not passed considering the capacity of the Ni preplating system. Giving one example, with an ordinary electroplating facility, sufficient control is possible with a range of 0.3 g/m2 or so, so if the lower limit is made .0.05 g/m2, 0.05 to 0.35 g/m2 or so can be controlled to. Further, if making the lower limit 0.5 g/m2, 0.5 to 0.8 g/m2 or so can be controlled to. The most advantageous mode in the present invention considering the cost is shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 shows the preferable range of the amount of Ni preplating of the different plating sheets.<br>
After Ni preplating, the sheet is rapidly heated in a nonoxidizing or reducing atmosphere to a sheet temperature of 430 to 500°C at a rate of temperature rise of 20°C/sec or more. This treatment is necessary for securing wettability of the hot dip plating or plating adhesion. After this heating, the sheet is hot dip galvanized and wiped to adjust the basis weight.<br>
As the hot dip galvanization bath, various known types may be similarly applied including alloy plating baths containing Zn. Giving a specific example, by including Al in an amount of 0.05 to 1.0% in the hot dip<br><br>
galvanization bath, due to the action of Al, hot dip galvanized steel sheet with a good plating adhesion can be produced. Further, by further including Mg in an amount of 0.01 to 1.0% in the bath, hot dip galvanized steel sheet with a good corrosion resistance can be produced. Further, Ni, Co, Ti, Pb, Bi, Sb, Sn, Si, etc. may be added to the bath in very fine amounts of 0.001 to 0.1% or so. Further, if heat treating hot dip galvanized steel sheet produced in the above way by a known method, a hot dip galvannealed steel sheet can also be produced.<br>
Further, it is possible to include 1 to 15% of Al to the hot dip galvanization bath to obtain a good corrosion resistance Zn-Al hot dip galvannealed steel sheet. It is also possible to further include Mg in an amount of 1.0 to 5.0% in the bath to obtain an even better corrosion resistance Zn-Al-Mg hot dip galvannealed steel sheet. Still further, it is possible to include Si in an amount of 0.01 to 1.0% to obtain a still better corrosion resistance Zn-Al-Mg-Si hot dip galvannealed steel sheet.<br>
Further, it is possible to include* Al in a large amount of 15 to 80% in the hot dip galvanization bath to obtain an even better corrosion resistance Zn-Al hot dip galvannealed steel sheet. Further, it is possible to include Si in an amount of 0.01 to 1.0% to obtain a still further corrosion resistance Zn-Al-Si hot dip galvannealed steel sheet.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The seven types of plating sheets shown in Table 1 were used. The plating sheets 1 to 4 were annealed cold-rolled steel sheets, while 5 to 6 were pickled hot-rolled steel sheets. These were pretreated as shown in Table 2, then electroplated in plating baths shown in Table 3 (bath temperature 60°C, current density 30 A/dm2) for Ni preplating. After this, they were heated in a 3%Ha+N2 atmosphere by a 50°C/sec rate of temperature rise up to 460°C, immediately dipped in a hot dip galvanization bath<br>
held at 450°C and held there for 3 seconds, then were wiped to adjust the basis weight. The basis weight was made 60 g/m2.<br>
Here, in Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, the hot dip plating baths used were ones to which 0.2% of Al was added. The amount of Ni preplating in Example 1, as shown in Table 4, was made different for each plating sheet. In Comparative Example 1 and Comparative Example 2, as shown in Table 4, the amount of Ni preplating was made the same for each plating sheet.<br>
In Example 2, the hot dip plating bath used was one to which 0.2% of Al and 0.5% of Mg were added. The amount of Ni preplating, as shown in Table 4, was made different for each plating sheet.<br>
In Example 3, the hot dip plating bath used was one to which 10% of Al, 3% of Mg, and 0.2% of Si were added. The amount of Ni preplating, as shown in Table 4, was made different for each plating sheet.<br>
In Example 4, the hot dip plating bath used was one to which 55% of Al and 0.2% of Si were added. The amount of Ni preplating, as shown in Table 4, was made different for each plating sheet.<br>
Each sample was plated, visually observed for appearance, and checked for the presence of any nonplating or other abnormalities. <br>
