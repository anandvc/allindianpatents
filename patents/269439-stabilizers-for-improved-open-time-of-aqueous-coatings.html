				<td>DULOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE DELAYED RELEASE FORMULATIONS<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No.<br>
60/802,849, filed May 22,2006, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention encompasses duloxetine hydrochloride delayed release  •<br>
formulations and methods for their manufacture.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]	Duloxetine hydrochloride is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake<br>
inhibitor ("SSRI"), having the chemical name (+)-(S)-N-methyl-'y-(l-naphthyloxy)-2-thiophenepropylamine hydrochloride, a molecular formula of C18H19NOS-HCl, and a molecular weight of 333.88. The chemical structure of duloxetine hydrochloride may be represented by Formula I.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0004]	Duloxetine hydrochloride is disclosed in European Publication No. 2736S8,<br>
and is currently marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of major depressive disorder under the trade name CYMBALTA® as 20, 30, and 60 mg delayed release enteric-coated capsules. CYMBALTA® tablets reportedly contain duloxetine hydrochloride and the inactive ingredients FD&amp;C Blue No. 2, gelatin, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sucrose, sugar spheres, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate, and, optionally, iron oxide yellow.<br><br>
[0005]	U.S. patent No. 5,508,276 ("the '276 patent") discloses a delayed release<br>
duloxetine formulation in the form of an enteric duloxetine pellet. The disclosed enteric coating layer contains an enteric polymer having only a small number of carboxylic acid groups per repeating unit. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate ("HPMCAS") is disclosed as the preferred enteric polymer. When HPMCAS is applied in the form of a suspension, the '276 patent discloses that it is advisable to cool the suspension below 20°C before application, as 'well as to use tubing with a small diameter and to cool the tubing and nozzle of the spray-drier. When HPMCAS is applied in the form of an aqueous solution, the *276 patent discloses that the HPMCAS should be neutralized, for example, with ammonia to facilitate its dissolution. The '276 patent also discloses that duloxetine was'found to react with many enteric coatings to form a slowly soluble or insoluble coating. This may lead to a disadvantageous drug-releasing profile and/or low bioavailability. The '276 patent also discloses that the enteric pharmaceutical formulations are manufactured in such a way that the product passes unchanged through the stomach of the patient, and dissolves and releases the active ingredient quickly when it leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine. This is accomplished by enclosing the active ingredient in the inner part of the tablet or pellet in a film or envelope, the "enteric coating", which is insoluble in acid environments, such as the stomach, but is soluble in near-neutral environments such as the small intestine.<br>
[0006]	Delayed release formulations are advantageous, as they prevent exposure of an<br>
acid sensitive active pharmaceutical ingredient ("APT) to the acidic environment of a patient's stomach, preventing degradation of the API and/or irritation of the patient's stomach. Thus, additional delayed release formulations of duloxetine hydrochloride would be advantageous. The present invention provides such a delayed formulation of duloxetine hydrochloride.<br>
