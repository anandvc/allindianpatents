				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PYRAZINECARBOXAMIDE DERIVATIVES AND PLANT DISEASE CONTROLLING<br>
AGENTS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to pyrazinecarboxamide<br>
derivatives or their salts, and to plant disease controlling<br>
agents for agricultural and horticultural uses which contain<br>
the said compound as an active ingredient.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Certain pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives are heretofore<br>
known to exhibit pest-controlling activity (for example, refer<br>
to the Official Gazette of JP-A Hei 2-175 and the Pamphlet of<br>
PCT 05/115994). Also, some biphenyl compounds are found to be<br>
effective for controlling the destructive or injurious fungi<br>
(for example, refer to the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent<br>
No. 3202079).<br>
[Disclosure of Invention]<br>
[The Problem That the Invention Is Intended to Solve]<br>
However, various problems have been left unsolved, as<br>
may be reflected by the problems being encountered in that the<br>
compounds described in the Official Gazette of JP-A Hei 2-175,<br>
do not exhibit any practically useful activity against gray<br>
mould disease and powdery mildew, and the compounds mentioned<br><br>
in the Pamphlet of WO 05/115994 show acaricidal activity but<br>
decreased bactericidal or fungicidal activity, while those<br>
described in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent No.<br>
3202079 not only exhibit reduced activity against powdery<br>
mildew but also fail to elicit any practically useful activity<br>
against the diseases caused,by the fungi of the Basidomycetes<br>
class, such as leaf rust of a wheat plant and sheath blight<br>
of a rice plant. As has been delineated above, the compounds<br>
pertaining to the prior art have not always been found to be<br>
satisfactory as a plant disease controlling agent for<br>
agricultural and horticultural uses in terms of the efficacy<br>
and the width of pest-controlling spectrum. In recent years,<br>
intensified attention has been focused on the recently mounting<br>
loads of deleterious, harmful effects to the earth environment,<br>
and in the field of plant disease controlling agents or<br>
formulations for agricultural and horticultural uses, likewise,<br>
this has resulted in currently strengthened demands for the<br>
compounds which possess a widened pest-controlling spectrum<br>
at lowered application rates.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
The present inventors, with a specific view to solving<br>
the above-described problems, conducted repeatedly intensive<br>
research studies, and as a result, found that a<br>
pyrazinecarboxamide derivative represented by the general<br>
formula (I) and its salts according to the present invention,<br>
when processed into a plant disease controlling agent for<br>
agricultural and horticultural uses, do not only produce<br><br>
improved pest controlling effects but also show the extremely<br>
widened fungicidal spectrum, thus culminating into completion<br>
of the present invention. Namely, the present invention relates<br>

Test on the controlling effect against brown leaf rust of wheat<br>
plant<br>
A one-leaf aged wheat plant (the cultivar: Hokushln)<br>
raised as a seedling in a pot of 6 cm in diameter was subjected<br>
to foliar application with a diluted emulsion of the<br>
emulsifiable concentrate of the compound of the present<br>
invention prepared in accordance with Agrochemical Formulation<br>
Example 1,• which diluted emulsion was produced by diluting the<br>
concentrate with water to the specifically determined volume.<br>
On the following day after the application, the wheat plant<br>
was inoculated by spraying of a suspension of spores as obtained<br>
from wheat plants afflicted with the causal fungus of brown<br>
leaf rust (Pucclnla recondita), and maintained at 20"C under<br>
humid conditions. Seven days after the inoculation, the<br>
controlling effect was assessed according the criteria of<br>
judgment as set forth in Test Example 1.<br>
