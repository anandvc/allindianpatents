FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a device and process for cleaning flue gas as well as<br>
process gas. In particular the present invention relates to a thermal energy<br>
recuperation type flue gas cleaning device for hot dust laden flue gases and process<br>
thereof. The device consumes less power and nominal water yet effectively cleans<br>
flue gases. The device comprises vertical hot flue gas channels through which the gas<br>
to be cleaned in passed from top to bottom and simultaneous cooling of the hot flue<br>
gas by dissipation of heat through the adjacent walls of the channels leading to<br>
increasing viscosity of the dust particles to aid their separation from the flue gas and<br>
collecting in dust collector and passing cleaned flue gases through cold channels so<br>
that they are simultaneously reheated as they pass from bottom to top of the device to<br>
be lead outside.<br>
The device may be used for cleaning of the hot dust laden flue gases emitting out<br>
from any combustion sources or incineration source or thermal reduction, source. The<br>
device can be usedjmjependently or can be put in series to the existing cleaning<br>
devices as cyclon^ESF^\bag filter, venturi scrubber etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The increasing air pollution is a serious cause of concern at all levels. To control the<br>
air pollution emitting from various types of combustion incineration and reduction<br>
processes, the flue gases are presently being cleaned by various methods such as<br>
Cyclone, Ventury Scrubber, Wet Scrubber, Box Type dust Catcher, Bag filter, ESPs,<br>
and such other devices.<br>
In most of these devices the hot flue gases are required to be cooled to a certain<br>
temperature for cleaning. There after the cleaned gases require to be mechanically<br>
blown out with the help of a mechanically driven blower or fan. All these processes<br>
consume lot of water in cooling and power in blowing; inspite of this, effective<br>
cleaning of flue gas is not achieved. In some of the wet scrubbing processes, acidic<br>
effluents are generated, which again is a problem for the environment. Of late a large<br>
number of sponge iron rotary kilns have been established and are being established,<br>
which emit enormous quantity of hot dust laden flue gases. The air pollution control<br>
and cleaning of these flue gases require huge investment and consume lot of power<br>
and consume lot of water too. The direct water scrubbing also cause huge amount of<br>
acidic effluent generation.<br>
At present the flue gas cleaning and particulate matter removal is done in the<br>
following manner.<br>
Hot dust laden flue gases emerging out of the reducing metallurgical process (such as<br>
DRI and sponge iron, blast furnace, sintering kiln, cement kiln etc. process) which<br>
contain sufficient quantities of un-combusted reducing gases are first pureed with air<br>
for combustion of un-combusted gases, in after burning chamber for effective<br>
combustion of these un-burnt gases, which increases the temperature and the volume<br>
of the flue gases.<br><br>
Then the hot flue gases are cooled in a GCT (gas Conditioning Tower) by spraying<br>
water on it, which again consumes lot of water and increases the gas volume due to<br>
the formation of steam and also generate acid, due to hot contact ofthese gases with<br>
water vapor.<br>
The hot un-cleaned flue gases are either passed after ABC/GCT or before through<br>
widened path called dust settling chamber, which arrest or allows to settle the course<br>
particles in the flue gases. The flue gases normally travel horizontally in this chamber.<br>
Then these gases are again cooled-directly or indirectly by air or water up-to 140°C to<br>
200°C and then passed through ESP or bag filter or cyclone or wet scrubber and then<br>
these cleaned gases are drafted out through the chimney with the help of the FD/ID<br>
Fan; at the same [140 to 200°C] temperature, which requires enormous power for<br>
emitting or blowing out through chimney.<br>
At present in the above-explained course of cooling of the hot gases, the cleaned<br>
cooled gases are not used for extraction of thermal energy from hot flue gases. The<br>
cooling of the gases is done in various ways, which involves direct purging of water<br>
or indirect cooling through water or air. But also in the above-explained process of<br>
cooling the dust is normally not removed. The dust is normally removed after cooling.<br>
Only in case of wet scrubbing the dust also is washed out as well as the flue gases get<br>
cooled.<br>
The cleaning is carried on by various equipments such as cyclone dust collector, wet<br>
scrubber, venturi scrubber, dust catcher, electro-static precipitator etc. Most of these<br>
equipments are different in themselves, as explained below:<br>
Cyclone: Cyclone dust collector can be used to clean the gas in hot condition or cold<br>
condition of the gas too. But cooling of the gas is independent of the gas cleaning. In<br>
most of these gases cooling of the gas is done independently or separately. In these<br>
systems the gas cooling is not the part of the gas cleaning. In the Cyclone dust<br>
collector the gas is given a circular movement and due to the increasing circular<br>
velocity of the gas the dust are separated due to centrifugal force and trapped out in<br>
the bottom. There is no change in the temperature profile of the flue gas during the<br>
cleaning or separation of the dust. Almost the same temperature remains in the gas at<br>
the inlet and outlet of the cyclone. The dust collected at the bottom of the cyclone is<br>
some times collected in the water bath trough, but this water bath is slightly different<br>
then, what is proposed by me. Specially for the reason that the dust in cyclone is<br>
normally released from the flue gas stream at a point higher than the water bath,<br>
inside the cyclone and only the dust falls out of the flue stream or cyclone due to the<br>
centrifugal force and continue to fall due to gravity towards the bottom pot where<br>
dust is collected, thus in this case this box actually works only acts as a dust storage<br>
bin.<br>
Dust Catcher:<br>
Even in the conventional dust catcher the flue gas of any temperature is let into a<br>
larger box of a greater volume where the flue gas looses its velocity and the dust<br>
buoyant in it fall down due to the gravitational pull. Enough time is provided for<br>
settlement of the dust.<br><br>
No cooling is designed and the gas leaves the chamber in the same temperature<br>
normally such dust catcher are horizontally placed.<br>
Wet Scrubber:<br>
It is a device in which the flue gases are passed through a water/ liquid shower in<br>
which the dust are washed out of the gas stream and the dust is collected in the bottom<br>
as water slurry.<br>
The gas temperature also falls down thus requires mechanical power for drafting out<br>
through the chimney.<br>
The principle of dust separation is actually wet washing of the gases.<br>
Venturi Scrubber:<br>
The dust laden flue gases are forced downwards through a narrowed down venturi<br>
opening which is placed above a water bath. Thus due to the narrowed venturi<br>
opening the flue gas attain a greater velocity which is also attained by the particulate/<br>
dust matter. Thus the dust or the particle get trapped into the water bath due to the jet<br>
force of the gases created at the venturi. Here the gravitational force is not so much<br>
important as the force created by venturi jet is normally higher than the self attained<br>
gravitational momentum. Also there is no change is created in the flue gas<br>
temperature, for separation of the dust. The cleaned gas are then forced out at the<br>
same temperature to the atmosphere by FD/ID fan through a chimney.<br>
Electrostatic Precipitator (E.S.P.):<br>
In the electrostatic precipitator the gases are cooled up to 160°C or below by various<br>
methods but none has so far used the cooled and cleaned waste gases for cooling the<br>
hot waste gases for cooling, cleaning through ESP.<br>
The cooled gases are passed through electro-statically charged plates charged with<br>
electricity and the dust get collected on these plates.<br>
Bag Filter:<br>
In this process the cooled gas below 170°C temperature is forced through a fabric<br>
which arrests the dust on it's pore and the collected dust is periodically collected by<br>
de-dusting, whereas in proposed device no filtration material is used.<br>
Known cooling method of hot flue gases:<br>
Mostly the hot flue gases are presently cooled independently and separately out side<br>
the above-mentioned gas cleaning devices. The hot flue gases are cooled in a number<br>
of ways:<br>
i.	Direct spraying of water on hot flue gases: This consumes lot of water,<br>
creates acidic effluent, increases the volume of hot flue gases, causes<br>
slurry due to the dust in particulate matters.<br>
ii. Indirect cooling through water Tubes: This also consumes lot of water,<br>
requires cooling tower for cooling of heated up water, requires power<br>
for flow of cooling water and cooling tower fan.<br><br>
iii. Waste heat Recovery in combustion Air/or Air Cooling:<br>
a)	in this process the heat is introduced in the combustion air<br>
which is utilized in the combustion, but cools only to a small<br>
extent.<br>
b)	the flue gas may require further cooling with water or air.<br>
c)	cooling done only by the atmospheric air causes lot of heat<br>
built up in the ground atmosphere and power is required to<br>
blow the cooling air as well as the flue gases.<br>
d)	huge waste heat exchanger is required for the air cooling.<br>
There are several such other known process for the flue gas cooling.<br>
There are several other ways for dust collection, which is difficult to narrate all but<br>
none of these have the following features which are claimed by me in the proposed<br>
process.<br>
I.	hot dust laden flue gas is gradually cooled by transferring the heat into<br>
cleaned cooled flue gases.<br>
II.	hot dust laden flue gases travel downwards into a bell type or cone<br>
type of flue channel or parallel channel where in the dust laden flue<br>
gases get cooled to loose their viscosity and volume both thus a<br>
differential traveling speed is achieved between the gas and particle<br>
and reduced drag force is available for particles to settle.<br>
III.	heat of the hot flue gases is recuperated to help the emission of the<br>
cleaned cooled flue gas.<br>
IV.	draft control device used for maintaining the positive pressure in the<br>
kiln or combustion chamber is used to impart the increase in the<br>
entrance velocity of the flue gases into the cleaning devices.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF THE KNOWN ART:<br>
The known art has its own merits and demerits, which varies according to the<br>
equipment. But the main drawback is that the thermal energy contained in the flue<br>
gases is not imparted back in the emitting cleaned cooled flue gases. Thus in the<br>
process of cooling there is lot of energy required and lot of water or air is required to<br>
cool the hot flue gases, thereafter a lot of power is required for blowing out the<br>
cleaned cooled gases through the chimney.<br>
I. Draw back of the Known gas cleaning Systems:<br>
Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP):<br>
1.	needs lot of power to electrically charge the particles and to collect.<br>
2.	needs CO free gases or can cause explosion.<br>
3.	electrically resistant dust can not be trapped effectively.<br>
4.	need lot of water to cool the flue gases.<br><br>
5.need lot of power to blow out the cleaned flue gases through chimney.<br>
Cyclone:<br>
I.	dust removal is better in coarser particles.<br>
II.	a great pressure drop is there thus needs lot of power to meet<br>
the pressure drop.<br>
III.	need lot of water to cool the flue gases.<br>
IV.	need lot of power to blow out the cleaned flue gases through<br>
chimney.<br>
Dust Catcher:<br>
Needs huge volumetric area<br>
Wet Scrubber:<br>
I.	Generate acidic effluent.<br>
II.	Consumes lot of water.<br>
III.	Need lot of power to blow out the cleaned flue gases through<br>
chimney.<br>
Venturi Scrubber:<br>
I.	Generate acidic effluent.<br>
II.	Consumes lot of water.<br>
III.	Need lot of power to blow out the cleaned flue gases through<br>
chimney.<br>
Bag Filter:<br>
I.	can operate only at low temperature.<br>
II.	the bag filters get burst out.<br>
III.	there is a greater pressure drop with build up of the dust cake.<br>
IV.	need lot of water to cool the flue gases.<br>
V.	need lot of power to blow out the cleaned flue gases through<br>
chimney.<br>
II. Draw back of the known gas cooling system:<br>
i.	in the present flue gas cooling systems lot of water is consumed<br>
and when direct water spraying is done then acid is formed.<br>
When cooled with air huge heat exchangers are required and lot<br>
of power is required for cooling air blowing.<br>
To avoid all these problems the present device has been developed, which consumes<br>
less power and consumes nominal water and cleans the flue gases, better than the<br>
conventional flue gas cleaning mechanism.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus the primary object of the present invention is to provide a flue gas cleaning<br>
device which overcomes the drawbacks of known cleaning devices as discussed<br>
above.<br><br>
A further object of the of the present invention is to provide a flue gas cleaning device<br>
which consumes less power and nominal water yet effectively cleans hot dust laden<br>
flue gases.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a flue gas cleaning device which<br>
utilizes variation of temperature, viscosity, drag force of the flue gas.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a flue gas cleaning device<br>
which effects cooling and cleaning of flue gas simultaneously.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a flue gas cleaning device<br>
which reheats the cleaned flue gas<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The vertical hollow gas flow path or channel for the hot dust laden flue gas referred as<br>
the hot flue channel, is essentially a vertical hollow gas flow path, called channel<br>
placed almost perpendicular to earth at an angle almost or nearest to 90° or such angle<br>
nearer to 90o to earth, by which the gravitational pull force created on the dust<br>
particles or particulate matters, is not obstructed or not restricted or not resisted,<br>
during free fall of the particles contained in the gases.<br>
The number of hot flue channels can be one and in plurality to one and upto any<br>
numbers as per the requirement depending on the volume of the gases and<br>
temperature of the gases and composition of the gases.<br>
The shape of the hot flue channel can be made in a number of ways, as parallely<br>
placed rectangular path, or parallely placed square path, or parallely placed circular<br>
(pipe like) path, or as hexagonal or triangular, or oval, or semi circular, path created<br>
out of the plain surface walls or corrugated surface (walls), finned surface (walls) or<br>
corrugated finned surface (walls) or rough surface walls etc, in either side or on both<br>
side or a combination thereof of any such type or surface, to facilitate better heat<br>
transfer. The material of construction for such walls can be metallic or non metallic<br>
material (such as SiC or pure alumina) having good thermal conductivity and enough<br>
thermal endurance. The walls so created can be in thermal continuity or can be<br>
horizontally broken, by providing a thermally non-conducting insulating material and<br>
thermally stable insulating materials, in the horizontal plain of the walls at certain<br>
intervals, to break the "thermal conductive continuity" in the hot flue channel walls<br>
from top to bottom and to avoid an isothermal temperature build up in the hot flue<br>
channel walls from top to bottom. These are referred to as thermal breakers, the<br>
thermal breakers can be created by slitting the walls and packing or sealing it with<br>
heat insulating material and heat resistant material. The passage volume of the hot<br>
flue channel can be increased gradually towards the bottom side, by gradually<br>
increasing the gap between both the facing walls (in "X" axis) as well as by<br>
increasing the total horizontal width (in "Y" axis) of the hot flue channel walls.<br>
Another essential part of this embodiment is to create a gradual cooling of these down<br>
flowing hot gases from top to the bottom in the hot flue channel, by means of<br>
conducting out the thermal energy contained in the hot gases through the thermally<br>
conductive metallic walls or thermally conductive non metallic walls, enclosing the<br>
hot flue channel and thereby forming this hot flue channel, without restricting or<br>
resisting the free fall of the dust falling down along with the down flow of the hot flue<br>
gases.<br>
Another essential part of this embodiment is to have an inlet at the top of these hot<br>
flue channels for entry of the hot flue gases and an outlet at the bottom for the exit of<br>
the cooled gases.<br>
Another important part of this embodiment is to provide a dust receiving box filled<br>
with any liquid such as water or oil or mixture of it, placed below the hot flue<br>
channels in sealed communication to the hot flue channels bottom on one side and in<br>
sealed communication to the exit of the cooled gases on the other-side, and also with<br><br>
provision to gradually remove the dust collected in it without causing any potential<br>
pressure disturbance to the flow of the gases falling down from the hot flue channels<br>
and particulate matter falling down from the hot flue channels and also with the<br>
facility to maintain the liquid levels in this dust collection box to the desired levels or<br>
operate without any liquid when the condition or design so permits. In case the dust<br>
Being separated out are of the very course nature then this bottom hopper can be kept<br>
empty without any liquid also.<br>
Another essential part of the present embodiment is creation of cooling passage<br>
surrounding the hot flue channels where in the cooled cleaned gases or fresh air, or<br>
any other cooling gas, or water or liquid can be flown in reverse up flow manner or<br>
cross up flow manner or any other up flow manner to ensure effective removal of heat<br>
for gradual cooling (upto desired temperature) of the hot gases flowing down in the<br>
hot flue channels.<br>
An important feature of the present device or process is gradually cooling mechanism<br>
for cooling the hot flue gases traveling down in the hot flue channel, it also can be<br>
created in a number of ways, as explained below:<br>
a)	Allowing the reverse up flow or reverse flow or cross flow, through the<br>
cooling passage created between the hot flue channels here in with<br>
referred to as "cold flue channel" in this embodiment, by flow of the<br>
cleaned cooled gases to cool the hot gases and get heated up to<br>
facilitate better chimney draft, for exit in to the atmosphere or<br>
b)	Allowing the up flow or reverse up-flow; cross up flow of the ambient<br>
air or cooled air into the cold flue channel and then administering these<br>
heated up hot air directly into the chimney; or letting out the heated up<br>
air in to open atmosphere; and forcing the cleaned cooled gases<br>
through chimney by means of ID/FD fan or letting it out through the<br>
self created chimney draft.<br>
c)	Flowing the water or any other liquid in the cooling channels called<br>
cold flue channel, or jackets provided around the hot flue channel and<br>
forcing the cleaned cooled gases through chimney by means of ID/FD<br>
fan.<br>
Additional features which may be present along with these above essential features,<br>
are as under:<br>
1) Draft Control Mechanism:. This can be provided at the entrance point<br>
of the each hot flue channel for narrowing down the entrance orifice<br>
area with a suitable port narrowing mechanism, or arrangement, which<br>
will suitably control the draft for the source flue gas path, as well as<br>
enhance the entrance speed of the hot gases entering the hot flue<br>
channels, which imparts greater kinetic energy created due to the<br>
enhanced entrance velocity of the gases and thereby on the particulate<br>
matters too. The draft control mechanism can be created in a number<br>
of ways one of such possible way is illustrated in this embodiment, but<br>
is not restricted to this and can be done in several other manners, which<br>
are known to the people skilled in the art.<br><br>
The draft control mechanism can be kept even at the outlet point of the, flue<br>
gas or cleaned flue gases or at any other suitable location or can be controlled<br>
in any other manner known to the people skilled in the art. The draft control<br>
mechanism is not an essential component of this cleaning device but definitely<br>
can be used for better cleaning and for designing a more compact and efficient<br>
system. Alternative draft can also be controlled by narrowing down the path of<br>
the hot flue gas flow at any suitable or required position.<br>
2)	Pre cooling and Pre cleaning: In case of temperature of flue gas or the<br>
process gas is very high i.e. above 900°C and the dust load also is too<br>
high i.e. above 50 gm/Nm3. Then in such case a pre-cooling and pre-<br>
cleaning device can be installed before this device to bring the<br>
temperature of the hot flue gases to below 900°C and the dust load to<br>
below 50 gm/Nm3.<br>
The pre-cooling device can be made in any known method. However<br>
the reheated cleaned flue gases or process gases coming out the above<br>
flue gas cleaning device can be routed through this pre-cooling system<br>
to cool the very hot dust laden gases, as well as to add heat into the<br>
cleaned cooled flue gases or process gas, for emitting through chimney<br>
or for using in any process.<br>
3)	Secondary cleaning and reheating: Whenever the property of flue dust<br>
in process gases or flue gases, is such that the desired level of dust<br>
could not be removed or totally cleaned from the above devices and yet<br>
further dust removal is essential, then the additional cleaning of<br>
primarily cleaned and cooled flue gases can be performed by<br>
withdrawing the cleaned cool gases with the help of a ID/FD fan from<br>
the bottom of cold flue channel and passing those gases through the<br>
conventional equipments like cyclone, wet scrubber or ESP or bag<br>
filter etc. After this is cleaned then the finally cleaned gases are fed<br>
back into the bottom of the cold flue channel slightly above withdrawal<br>
port/ gas seal arrangement. In such cases the bottom of the cold flue<br>
channel is provided with a gas flow locking arrangement or gas seal to<br>
separate the two withdrawal port and release port and to avoid the<br>
remixing or return of finally cleaned gases to the withdrawal port and<br>
to allow the clear passage for the finally cleaned flue gases to move<br>
upwardly for emission through the chimney.<br>
Unlike the cyclone dust collector in the device of present invention the dust in the flue<br>
stream impinges directly into the bath whereby the dust gets stuck into the water/<br>
liquid bath, when the flue gas take an "U" turn from hot channel to cold channel. This<br>
also restricts the dust to get rebuoyant in the flue stream. So the principle of<br>
separation in the cyclone is first the centrifugal force for separation from flue gas<br>
stream and gravitational force for collection. Whereas in the proposed device the<br>
force of separation is accelerating gravitational pull in the particulate matter, due to<br>
reducing viscosity of the gases and reducing velocity of the gases.<br><br>
Although the above embodiment is designed primarily to remove the dust and<br>
particulate matters from the hot gas stream and to operate at the available positive<br>
pressure of the source and the draft created by the natural draft of the chimney but can<br>
be operated by inducing a mechanical draft by any electro-mechanical means. In<br>
addition to the above; the device can also be operated at higher pressures, in case of<br>
the requirement by suitably strengthening or keeping a higher thickness of the hot flue<br>
channel walls, and by creating a proper seal at the bottom hopper level. However in<br>
addition to the above "the system" can also be used for cleaning or removing or<br>
scrubbing of the gases by spray of suitable liquid absorbents for the absorption of the<br>
gas or gases, or by condensation, from the gaseous pollutants present in the flue gas/<br>
process gas/ air, enabling removal of any specific gas, such as water vapour or CO2,<br>
SOx, NOx, H2S etc present in the gas. Besides the system can also be used for<br>
reheating of such cleaned gases or can be used for generating the hot combustion air,<br>
or for generation of hot water stream or for generation of steam at low pressure, or<br>
can be used for generating any other hot gases such as O2, CO2, N2, CO, H2, CH4, or<br>
any other gas. (which will require such gases or liquid to be passed through the cold<br>
flue channel, which is deployed in this device to recover the heat from the hot gases).<br>
All these features are the additional features of the device and are independent of each<br>
other and are not limited to what is described specifically in the present embodiment,<br>
but shall extend to all such application and modification created or adopted by those<br>
who are skilled in the art, by using the same principles.<br>
Another feature of the present embodiment is to increase the path flow cross sectional<br>
area of the hot dust laden gases flowing down through these hot flue channels,<br>
gradually increasing the volume or cross sectional area of hot flue channels, from the<br>
top of the channel towards the bottom of the channel to reduce the velocity of the hot<br>
gases flowing down. In another alternative arrangement the path flow cross sectional<br>
area of the hot dust laden gases flowing through hot flue channels can be gradually<br>
decreased and then increased after a certain height, depending on the requirement.<br>
Another feature of the embodiment is to reduce the velocity of these gases flowing<br>
down from the top of the hot flue channel to the bottom of the hot flue channel, by<br>
increasing the density of the hot gases by gradually reducing the temperature of these<br>
hot gases.<br>
Another feature of the embodiment is to cool such hot gases which contain H2O in the<br>
vapour form to such a temperature level that water vapour get condensed and the<br>
liquid water is absorbed or adsorbed by the particulate matter, to become heavier or to<br>
attain higher density than their own bulk density, and form agglomerate which will<br>
facilitate better dust removal.<br>
In the process of dust separation as well as if required scrubbing of the pollutant<br>
gases, or unwanted gases from the gas stream, be it a flue gas or a process gas or<br>
mixture of other gases or only one gas or air, having higher temperature than ambient<br>
and loaded with dust, emitting out of any process vessel, or furnace, or kiln or from<br>
any such enclosure emitting the gases through an outlet, the such gas stream is led to a<br>
path which is vertically placed, oriented towards gravity, which is termed as hot flue<br>
channel, which comprises of the thermally conductive metallic walls, which are<br>
parallelly divided in to segments at certain interspaces, and such dividing gap in the<br><br>
wall is hermetically sealed, with any heat insulating heat resistant material. The walls<br>
having plain surface or corrugated surface to finned surface, rough surface, or studded<br>
surface or such distorted surface so as to facilitate the best possible heat transfer from<br>
the hot gases flowing down through it in to cold gases flowing up in the parallel path.<br>
Such hot dust laden gases are flown into single or a number of such hot flue channels,<br>
which are parallelly placed; at the available flow velocity or with enhanced flow<br>
velocity by narrowing down the entry port or narrowing down the path at any other<br>
suitable level, according to the available positive pressure from the source of the hot<br>
gases. Simultaneously inducing the reduction in the viscosity of the gases by gradual<br>
cooling of the gases through the outwards thermal conduction from the thermally<br>
conductive walls enclosing the hot flue channels thus creating a decreasing viscosity<br>
gradient from higher viscosity at the top to lowest at the bottom or outlet of the hot<br>
flue channel outlet port. Simultaneously providing an opportunity to very finely<br>
divided particulate matters to agglomerate together or get clustered. Thus reducing the<br>
drag force exerted on the particles to keep these buoyant in the gas stream and<br>
allowing it to accelerate towards the bottom at greater velocity due to gravity than the<br>
gas flow velocity, consequently inducing the required differential and enhanced<br>
kinetic energy added due to the gravitational pull in the particles to fallout of the hot<br>
gas stream.<br>
Thus it is a process of separation of dust from the hot or warm gases which have<br>
higher temperature than ambient temperature [or such higher temperature than a lower<br>
temperature, which can be economically achieved] by indirect cooling of the hot<br>
gases through water, liquid or oil, or such source of cool gases or cool air, cool liquid<br>
etc., by which the hot or warm gases can be gradually cooled to the best economically<br>
feasible temperature level, to reduce the viscosity and volume of gases. Thus the<br>
process employs the principle of cooling of the hot gases preferably to ambient level<br>
or if essentially required then lower than ambient temperature.<br>
The fundamental process used remains the same to primarily cool down (mostly<br>
through indirect heat transfer cooling) the hot dust laden gases in a manner (i.e. in a<br>
vertical flowing path) by which the removal of dust particles due to acceleration due<br>
to gravity is facilitated by reduction in viscosity and reduction in gas velocity and<br>
increase in the particle fall velocity and removal is further facilitated by moistening of<br>
the particles and further facilitated by clustering or agglomerate fine particles, by<br>
reduction in the velocity of the gases and can also be facilitated by mist scrubbing or<br>
water spraying on the particles, and also create an additional facility of removal of<br>
desired- undesired gases like SO2, NOx, CO2 is possible by mist spraying of the<br>
absorbent or alkaline solutions. It is further facilitated to reduce the power<br>
requirement for emitting the cleaned gases to atmosphere, by permitting the cleaned<br>
gases to get hot by drawing the thermal energy from the hot gases, in their way to<br>
exhaust out through the chimney. It also provides a facility to enrich the partially<br>
spent or partially oxidized, process gases or partially oxidized flue gases having<br>
economically combustible gases for further use in any process. It also facilitates to<br>
reheat these cleaned gases for further applications in hot (reheated) condition.<br>
But the main spirit of the invention remains to allow the dust to fall due to change in<br>
the viscosity of the gases and changed drag force and by increase in particle drop<br>
velocity added due to the gravitational force also caused due to accumulation of<br>
moisture present in the gases or when injected in the gases in hot condition before<br><br>
cooling, and due to the accumulation and clustering caused in the particulate matters<br>
by the operation of the device.<br>
Other alternative embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit of the<br>
invention and no limitations are to be inferred except as specifically set forth in the<br>
appended claims.<br>
The invention is now described with non limiting illustrative accompanying drawings<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Primary Cooling and Primary cleaning:<br>
As illustrated in figures 1 and 2 flue gas cleaning device of the present invention has<br>
been developed to segregate or to remove and collect the dust or particulate matter<br>
contained in the hot flue/ process gas stream (generating from a furnace or a kiln or<br>
some such combustion chamber or process gas source) by injecting or directing the<br>
hot dust laden flue gas stream by source duct of hot flue gas (W) to the duct<br>
connecting the flue gas source (A) to the hot dust laden flue gas distribution dome(B)<br>
at the top of the dust collector (flue gas cleaning device) in to the hot flue channel (I)<br>
in hot condition, through a narrowed down entrance port by a unique draft control<br>
mechanism (F) by utilizing and for maintaining, the positive pressure of the kiln or<br>
combustion chamber or furnace or the gas source; to facilitate or to achieve the best<br>
possible gas entrance velocity (in accordance to the available positive pressure<br>
available at the kiln/ furnace/ combustion chamber outlet) or to impart best possible<br>
differential kinetic energy/force which can be imparted in the dust or particulate<br>
matter for separation of dust or particulate matter from flue stream. Without affecting<br>
the requirement of the positive pressure at the source. The flue stream in the hot<br>
condition is entered in to a number of hot flue channels (I), having gradually widening<br>
passage or wider space towards the earth or bottom of the device and parallelly placed<br>
and separated with a common thermal conductive metallic sheet wall (K) of the cold<br>
flue channels (J), which are having narrower space at the bottom and wider space at<br>
the top; The hot flue gases are entered through narrowed entry (narrowing of the port<br>
is adjusted according to the available positive pressure of the kiln/ furnace/<br>
combustion chamber, without affecting the combustion chemistry inside the kiln) and<br>
directed towards the gravity i.e. towards the earth or bottom at an appropriate angle or<br>
at the right angle; so that the velocity or differential kinetic energy achieved by the<br>
particulate matters or dust are either maintained or accelerated or enhanced towards<br>
the earth due to gravity for separation. The hot gases traveling down towards earth<br>
are separated with good thermally conductive material made of metallic sheet or<br>
plates (K) (with heat resistant property), forming parallel gas up flow path, which is<br>
termed herewith as cold flue channel (J) in which the cooled and cleaned flue gas<br>
flow upwards towards chimney (CC)(shown in figure 9) for exhaust into the<br>
atmosphere, during the course of upward movement the cooled and cleaned flue gases<br>
regain the thermal energy through heat conduction through the thermally conductive<br>
jacket wall (K) made of metallic plate/ sheet/ pipe material (which are parallely<br>
divided at certain intervals by slitting across horizontally and this gap is filled up and<br>
hermetically sealed with any suitable heat resistant thermally insulating material) and<br>
thus get heated up and in the course of up-flow as well as cool down the downward<br>
traveling un-cleaned hot flue gases in the hot flue channels (I). This way the thermal<br>
energy content in hot un-cleaned flue gases required to be removed for the cooling is<br>
taken away by the cooled clean flue gases and thus the cleaned cool gases attain<br>
sufficient thermal energy to create a good chimney draft for emitting out through<br>
chimney (CC) to the atmosphere, hot un-cleaned flue gases while traveling down and<br>
while getting cooled, lose their thermal energy content thus their volume gets reduced<br>
and viscosity gets reduced. The particulate / dust matter falling velocity gets<br><br>
enhanced velocity than the gaseous velocity, also the finely divided particulate get an<br>
opportunity to agglomerate or cluster to a larger cluster of the particulates, all these<br>
together results in better separation of dust or particulate matter buoyant in the flue<br>
stream.<br>
With this flue heat recuperation the temperature of the hot flue gas stream is<br>
attempted to brought down to the best possible minimum temperature. It is worked<br>
out that a hot stream of flue gases emitting at 900°C or below from sponge iron kiln or<br>
furnace or combustion chamber or any other such combustions sources, can be cooled<br>
down up to or below 200°C most preferably to below 100°C in this way, and about<br>
80% and above dust particulate matter attain or gain settle able/ removable differential<br>
kinetic energy in this process. Up to this stage of cooling is referred to as primary<br>
cooling.<br>
Secondary cooling:<br>
In order to remove the dust from the dust laden stream or to further clean the gas<br>
through a cyclone or bag filter or ESP or wet scrubbing the gas requires further<br>
cooling. Thus the secondary cooling is done by indirect cooling through water<br>
bearing carrying tubes over which the primarily cooled flue stream is flown through<br>
water carrying tubes (L &amp; M) placed across the hot flue channels (I) and cold flue<br>
channels (J) and the heat remaining in the primarily cooled gases are conducted out in<br>
the water flowing inside these tubes, from the hot flue channel (I) gases and partially<br>
transmitted back in to the cold flue channel (J) gases.<br>
The flue gas so cooled is further continued to flow towards bottom; (i) for further<br>
cooling of the gases through bundle of water cooling tubes (L &amp; M) and water misting<br>
tubes (O) and; (ii) after reaching to the bottom most part of the hot flue channel, the<br>
gases emit out of the hot flue channel and here the dust or particulate matters get<br>
removed from the gas stream while the dust laden gas take a "U" turn or a return<br>
upward path from hot flue channel (I) to cold flue channel (J), at this point the dust<br>
particle fall out in the bottom dust trap hopper (S) with liquid seal ( R) having liquid<br>
(T)or without any liquid. The dust accumulated or slurry formed with the dust in the<br>
dust hopper by trapping dust is removed through slurry discharge pipe (V) provided<br>
with slurry discharge port valve (U).<br>
The un-cleaned flue gas is cooled between 70 to 140°C for the dust removal from this<br>
device or for further cleaning through bag filter or cyclone or wet scrubber. When<br>
cyclone or bag filter is used for the further cleaning then the gas is cooled between 90<br>
to 170°C. But when the gas is cleaned through a wet scrubber wet water bath or water<br>
sprinkling then the temperature of the flue gas is brought down below 90°C, [to<br>
reduce the evaporation losses and to avoid the boiling of the water]. In case the<br>
secondary cleaning is not required then the temperature of the flue gases for cleaning<br>
through this device is sufficient even up to 200°C.<br>
This stage of cooling through water bearing tubes is defined as secondary cooling.<br>
Optionally the equipment is so devised that the flue gases after this level of cleaning<br>
require further secondary cleaning, by processing through some other secondary<br>
device(Z), such as ESP, Cyclone, Wet Scrubber, Ventury Scrubber, Bag Filter etc.<br><br>
located out side the body of this device then the flue gases at this point take "L" turn<br>
or side path and are withdrawn out through the side openings which are connected to<br>
secondary cleaning devices in series to an ID/FD Fan and after the secondary cleaning<br>
those cleaned gases are fed into the cold flue channel bottom through the side<br>
openings<br>
Secondary cleaning:<br>
The so far cleaned cooled flue gases are then drafted out with the help of an ID/FD<br>
fan from the bottom of the cold flue channel through an opening (O) and are passed<br>
through the secondary cleaning ESP or wet scrubber or ventury scrubber or cyclone or<br>
bag filter and then finally cleaned flue gas is forced back in to flue gas recuperation<br>
chamber, called "cold flue channel" through an opening (N) for recovery of the heat<br>
contained in the un-cleaned hot flue gases.<br>
This way the un-cleaned hot flue gases (traveling down in the hot flue channel) get<br>
cooled as well as finally get cleaned; and cooled cleaned flue gases get hot for<br>
emission from the chimney. During the secondary cleaning process the cold flue<br>
channel seal (P) provided at the bottom of the channel is kept closed.<br>
When the secondary cleaning is not required then the cold flue channel seal (P) is<br>
kept open and the cleaned and cooled flue gases emitting out of the hot flue channel<br>
(I) take a "U" turn and enter in to the bottom of the cold flue channel (J) and flow<br>
upwards to get heated up by withdrawing the heat from the hot gases flowing down in<br>
the hot flue channel, and this way the cleaned gases emit out of cold flue channel top<br>
directly to the chimney or through the pre-cooling and pre-cleaning device to chimney<br>
(CC))<br>
dust Trapping:<br>
The dust falling out of the hot flue channel (I) are trapped into a vessel known as dust<br>
collection hopper/trap (S) placed below the hot and cold flue channel (I &amp; J), which<br>
can be kept empty or filled with water or liquid, placed below the hot &amp; cold flue<br>
channels (I and J) as shown in figure 1 &amp; 2. The water / liquid trap placed below the<br>
hot and cold channel (I &amp; J) can be dry or can have a variable water/ liquid level (T).<br>
When the dust particles are coarser then the liquid or water is not required in the dust<br>
trap. When the dust particles are fine then the liquid or water filling in the dust trap<br>
bath is required for dust trapping. When the path resistance or the pressure drop in the<br>
hot and cold flue channel (I and J) is lower than the draft created by chimney draft<br>
then the water/ liquid level is so maintained up to a level that a clear space is available<br>
for the cooled down hot flue gases to comfortable pass through from hot channel (I) to<br>
cold channel (J) by taking an upward "U" turn and the gas seal (P) is kept open. But<br>
when it is required that the gases so cleaned need to be further cleaned through a<br>
Cyclone or Bag Filter or Wet scrubbing then the cold flue channel passage is sealed<br>
by closing the gas Sealing valve (P) placed in the cold flue channel (J), lower portion.<br>
In this situation the flue gases from the cold flue channel bottom are withdrawn or<br>
sucked by a Blower through the suction ports opening (Q) placed below the water<br>
cooling pipes or water cooling vessels and such withdrawn gases are forced through<br>
the ESP or ventury scrubber cyclone or bag filter or wet scrubber or any such<br>
secondary cleaning devices. After this secondary cleaning the cleaned cool flue gases<br><br>
are released into the bottom of cold flue channels (J) through the flue release port<br>
opening (N) provided at the bottom of cold flue channel, placed above the gas sealing<br>
valve (P). Then the gases flow upwards and emit out of the device through duct (G),<br>
which leads these cleaned gases directly to the chimney or through a pre-cooling<br>
device to the chimney.<br>
Flaring of the un-combusted gases:<br>
The clean cool flue gases attain sufficient temperature while traveling upward and<br>
during reheating, therefore the un-combusted gases like CO and or H2 and such<br>
combustible gases become flammable. As shown in figure 9, to inflamate / Flare<br>
these gases required quantity of air is forced into the chimney (CC) with the help of a<br>
Blower (BB) and released at the upper portion of chimney (CC) via combustion air<br>
nozzle (AA). Thus the un-combusted gases get combusted and flue gases become<br>
further hot and gain better draft due to additional heat generation due to combustion<br>
of these un-combusted gases.<br>
This additional blowing of required combustion Air, also propels the gases upwards<br>
for better emission out of chimney stack. The use of the Jet Nozzle (AA) at the<br>
combustion Air Release point further help to create an additional draft.<br>
Although the above invention is presented in a particular form and shape but the same<br>
can be fabricated in a number of ways without deviating from the main spirit of the<br>
inventions. The following changes can be done keeping the other features as above:<br>
Figures 3 A and 3B illustrate the hot flue channels as inverted "V" shape ie is<br>
broadening from top to bottom. Figure 3B illustrates the whole device where the hot<br>
flue channel in inverted "V" shape and other embodiments and their relation is<br>
shown.(Fig-3).Figure 4 illustrates the hot flue channels as normal "V" shape i.e<br>
narrowing from top to bottom while the hot flue channels as illustrated in figure 5A.<br>
Figures 6a and B illustrate the hot flue channels with the upper half "V" shape and<br>
lower half inverted "V" shape as in figure . The other features being similar as<br>
mentioned above. The hot flue channels may also be of rectangular or circular or<br>
conical shape or in any other shape.<br>
Similarly the cold flue channels can be provided variously. As illustrated in figures 1<br>
and 6A they may be vertically arranged with as reverse flow or horizontally arranged<br>
with cross flow as demonstrated in Figures-3(A), 3(B),4,5(A), 5(B) 6(B), 7. The other<br>
features being similar as mentioned above. There may be further modifications in<br>
other known manners of flow of cooling gas or liquid to extract the heat out of the hot<br>
flue channels.<br>
The dust cleaned gas emerging out of the hot flue channels can be collected through a<br>
single port from either side or from two or plural port from various sides and<br>
processed through an outside cleaning device and forced into the cold flue channels<br>
for re-heating or let out directly to the chimney.<br>
Also the cleaned flue gas while being collected as defined above can be washed<br>
through water or some other liquid solution shower to further arrest the particulate<br>
matters or scrub the gases, during the withdrawal flow of such gases.<br><br>
It is also not essential to have a dust collection hopper as shown in the drawing, the<br>
hopper can also be fabricated in a number of ways such as circular, hexagonal,<br>
octagonal, triangular etc. in accordance to the main body.<br>
Thus the flue gas cleaning process involves the following Stages:<br>
a]	Utilization of positive Pressure or Draft to be maintained in the Kiln for<br>
Injection/ Direction of the hot un-cleaned flue gases in to the cooling<br>
Recuperation chamber referred to as hot flue channel (I) through a "Narrowed<br>
Entry Port" to achieve the desired dust separation velocity/ or to Gain the best<br>
possible gas velocity from the available positive pressure, without affecting<br>
the Kiln/ Furnace or Combustion Chamber Environment.<br>
b]	Primary Cooling of the hot flue gases in the Recuperative hot flue channels (I)<br>
through the cleaned cooled flue gases moving upward in cold flue channel (J)<br>
for emission to atmosphere through chimney<br>
c]	Secondary cooling of un-cleaned hot flue gases through indirect contact of<br>
water with water carrying Tubes or Vessels up to steaming temperature in<br>
water pipes tubes, vessels (M) further cooling with water evaporating or cross<br>
water flowing type of water tubes(L), pipes, vessels and further cooling by<br>
water mists by releasing the mist through water misting pipes (O) and further<br>
contact of gases with water surface contact with water surface (T) placed in<br>
dust hopper (S).<br>
d]	Arresting the dust falling out of flue stream into an liquid bath (T) or water<br>
bath or an Oil bath or water bath having floating Oil Film on it by placing this<br>
in Hopper (S) below the hot flue gas channel.<br>
e]	If required Directing or drafting out the Primary cleaned flue gases into a<br>
Cyclone / Bag Filter/ water Scrubber/ ESP etc.(Secondary conventional<br>
cleaning devices) and then letting in the finally cleaned cooled gases into the<br>
cold flue channel (J) for gradually getting heated up for final emission through<br>
chimney (CC).<br>
f] It required Creating a mechanical draft with an ID/FD type motorized or<br>
mechanically driven Blower to compensate the Head loss caused during the<br>
Primary and Secondary cleaning.<br>
g]	Directing the cleaned and cooled flue gases in to the recuperative heating<br>
channel called cold flue channels for upward movement for heat Gain for<br>
emission through chimney. (In case the gases being cleaned or cooled are<br>
required to be used in some other process and are not to be let out into the<br>
atmosphere or not required to be passed through the cold flue channel then<br>
the other cooling gases or liquid medium from outside can be deployed as<br>
Explained elsewhere in this embodiment]<br>
h]	The so cleaned flue gases may contain some unburnt CO or Hydro Carbon<br>
or H2 thus a flaring provision is provided at just little bellow the top of the<br>
chimney by either forcing the combustion Air through a FD Fan (BB) and<br>
releasing the combustion air through a combustion air nozzle (AA) located<br>
at the upper segment of chimney (CC) (or by creating a self Air suction port<br>
at this level of chimney), which helps to combust the un-combusted part of<br><br>
reheated cleaned flue gases which further increases the temperature of the<br>
flue gases which results into better chimney draft.<br>
i]	Pre-cleaning and Pre-cooling: In case of temperature of the process gas is<br>
very high i.e. above 900°C and the dust load also is too high i.e. above 50<br>
gm/NM3. Then in such case a pre-cooling and pre-cleaning device can be<br>
installed before this device to bring the temperature of the hot flue gases to<br>
below 900°C and the dust load to below 60 gm/NM3.<br>
The pre-cooling device can be made in any known method. However the<br>
reheated cleaning flue gases or process gases coming out the above device<br>
can be routed through this pre-cooling system to cool the very hot dust laden<br>
gases, as well as to add heat into the cleaned cooled flue gases or process<br>
gas, for emitting through chimney or for using in any process.<br>
The Pre-cooling and Pre-cleaning device is placed in series between the hot<br>
gas source and the cleaning device for Pre-cooling and Pre-cleaning of the<br>
hot gases and it can also be put in series to the flue gas cleaning device and<br>
the chimney for further heating of cleaned Reheated flue gases.<br>

AA. Combustion Air Nozzle:<br>
This air nozzle is provided in the chimney for post combustion of un-combusted flue<br>
gases remaining in the flue stream (As shown in Fig-9).<br>
BB. Combustion Air FD Fan:<br>
This combustion air FD Fan is provided near the chimney for blowing the post<br>
combustion air in to the combustion air nozzle provided in the chimney (As shown in<br>
Fig-9).<br>
CC. Chimney.<br>
The duct is connected to the chimney. The chimney can be of any type as is usually<br>
built in general practice.<br>
DD. Cleaned flue gas duct From - flue gas cleaning device.:<br>
This is a Metallic duct having the refractory lining to minimize the heat loss from the<br>
cleaned and reheated flue gases.<br>
Best mode of working of the invention:<br>
The working of the process according to the present invention is described below with<br>
respect to preferred embodiment which should not be regarded as limiting the present<br>
process. The device is attached to a sponge iron rotary kiln through which waste hot<br>
gases are emitting out at 750° to 900° C, with dust load of above 30 gm per NM3 and<br>
with about 12% of unburnt CO. Then this device is fitted to the exhaust port of the<br>
Rotary Kiln, through a duct as shown in the figure and hot gases are speeded up with<br>
the draft control mechanism and such cleaned and cooled gas is then reheated in the<br>
cold flue gases and collected at the top of the devices, which is then again connected<br>
to the chimney for emission.<br>
The un-combusted gases get combusted due to the reheating of the gases, which attain<br>
the combustion temperature for which post combustion Air or Secondary Air can be<br>
forced into chimney from an independent blower or self induced draft itself can flare<br>
up the gas.<br>
The dust is collected from the bottom hopper placed below this device.<br>
The device developed for removal of dust from hot dust laden flue gases functions in<br>
the following stages.<br>
1)	Draft control with acceleration of dust laden flue gases acceleration of<br>
hot flue gases velocity is enhanced by using the positive pressure<br>
available from the hot flue gas source as well as maintaining the<br>
positive pressure in the kiln or combustion chambers etc. by using an<br>
unique draft control device.<br>
2)	Cooling of the hot dust flue gases with Exchange of heat or transfer of<br>
heat into the cleaned dust free cooled flue gases through an unique heat<br>
Transfer mechanism created in the device called hot flue channels and<br>
cold flue channel which are placed adjacent and divided with a<br><br>
common metallic wall having good heat exchange capacity or good<br>
thermal conductivity, whereas these walls have the horizontal thermal<br>
breaks at certain interspaces on the horizontal plain.<br>
3)	Primary Removal of dust form the hot dust Laden flue gas Stream: The<br>
dust particle get greater acceleration than the flue gas velocity while<br>
traveling down or towards the Earth and attain greater Earth ward<br>
traveling speed due to the decreased drag force created by reduced<br>
viscosity, as well as reduced gas velocity (caused due to cooling of the<br>
gases as well as increase in the volumetric space at the downwards<br>
levels) as well as due to clustering of Fine dust Particles, and dust<br>
Particles fall out of the flue gas stream at the bottom of the channel,<br>
when the flue gas Stream take an upward turn ("U" turn) to enter from<br>
the hot flue channel to cold flue channel/ or take a side turn ("L" turn)<br>
when removed for the Secondary cleaning.<br>
At this Point most of the particles continue to travel downwards<br>
towards earth and leave or get separated from the flue gas Path and fall<br>
down into the bottom placed dust Trap.<br>
4)	Dust Trapping: The dust which are removed from the hot flue gas<br>
Stream at the upward return ("U" Turn) or side Turn ("L" turn) point<br>
while entering to the cold flue channel are collected in this dust Trap,<br>
this dust Trap can be kept dry when the dust particles are course or can<br>
be filled with some liquid or Oil such as plain water or saline water or<br>
salt dissolved water or mineral oil or vegetable oil. When the liquid is<br>
used in the trap then the level of the liquid is so maintained that there is<br>
enough space remaining in between the liquid level and channel<br>
separation wall to allow the free passage to the downward gases in hot<br>
flue channel to take U turn and enter in to the cold flue channel.<br>
5)	Cleaned gas Emission to the atmosphere:<br>
The cleaned and cooled gases start traveling upward and gain<br>
temperature, while traveling upward by extracting the heat from the<br>
hot flue channel by conduction through the separating metallic wall.<br>
The hot gases move upwards because of the increase in temperature<br>
and chimney draft created due to the heat gained in the cleaned cooled<br>
flue gases. The path resistance is maintained due to the gradually<br>
widening upward path and increasing volume of the cold flue channel,<br>
in spite of the increasing volume of the reheating up cold flue gases;.<br>
The above mechanism is simple mechanism to remove the dust from<br>
hot dust Laden flue gases without use of any extra mechanical power<br>
required for the Handling of the gases. Also the system requires very<br>
little water for cooling and is thus self sustaining.<br>
6)	Secondary Cooling:<br>
For further improvement in the cooling efficiency of the gases as well<br>
as cleaning efficiency of the gases following devices can be added in<br>
the bottom ¼ portion of hot flue channel, a bundle of Pipes or Tubes or<br><br>
Vessels carrying cooling water or coolant or cooling oil can be placed<br>
to remove the remaining heat in the already cooled dust Laden flue<br>
gases. These pipes are placed across the hot and cold flue channel.<br>
When water is used in these cooling pipes then the Top Layers of these<br>
pipes are exposed to the higher temperature of hot flue gases, thus this<br>
may cause steaming of the water, thus the steam generated out of the<br>
these pipes is let out into the atmosphere.<br>
7)	Tertiary cooling:<br>
If the gases require further cooling than the above cooled temperature<br>
level then a water mist release pipe is placed at the level below the<br>
above mentioned liquid bearing cooling pipes in the hot flue channel<br>
bottom portion. The mist released from this pipe takes away lot of heat<br>
due to phase change of water or due to evaporation in Dry flue gases.<br>
Which further facilitates the removal of dust, as also the dust particle<br>
gain some moisture and become heavier for separation.<br>
The flue gases can get further cooled when they partially get in contact<br>
with the water surface at the dust trap, while they take a "U" Turn or<br>
"L" Turn from the hot flue channel to cold flue channel.<br>
8)	Additional cleaning through the conventional devices:<br>
However the System can be added with the device for the secondary<br>
cleaning by attaching the conventional dust cleaning equipments such<br>
as Cyclone, dust Filter, Bag Filters, Venture Scrubber or ESP etc.,<br>
along with an ID/FD fan to provide required power to handle the gases.<br>
Whenever the property of flue dust in process gases or flue gases, is<br>
such that the desired level of dust could not be removed or totally<br>
cleaned from the above devices and yet further dust removal is<br>
essential, then the additional cleaning of Primarily cleaned and cooled<br>
flue gases can be performed by withdrawing the cleaned cool gases<br>
with the help of a ID/FD fan from the bottom of cold flue channel and<br>
passing those gases through the conventional equipments like Cyclone,<br>
Wet Scrubber or ESP or Bag Filter etc. After this is cleaned then the<br>
finally cleaned gases are fed back into the bottom of the cold flue<br>
channel slightly above withdrawal port/ gas seal arrangement. In such<br>
cases the bottom of the cold flue channel is provided with a gas Flow<br>
locking arrangement or gas Seal to separate the withdrawal port and<br>
Release port and to avoid the remixing or return of finally cleaned<br>
gases to the withdrawal port and to allow the clear passage for the<br>
finally cleaned flue gases to move upwardly for emission through the<br>
chimney.<br>
To affect a better heat transfer through the separation walls or metallic<br>
conduction walls, the walls can be provided with the cross metallic studs/fins<br>
or cross wires or cross metallic rods or cross metallic pipes made of good<br>
thermally conductive metal. In such cases where the heat Transfer<br><br>
requirement can be met by simple ordinary wall plates then these are not<br>
provided.<br>
Thus the device of present invention scores over known gas cleaning system as under:<br>
i.	In most of the known flue gas cleaning device the temperature profile<br>
is the same throughout the device where as in the present device there<br>
is tremendous temperature gradient.<br>
ii. In most of the known flue gas cleaning devices the viscosity of the gas,<br>
remains the same, whereas in the present device and process the<br>
viscosity of the gas changes substantially.<br>
iii. In most of the known flue gas cleaning devices the drag force acting<br>
against the particulate matter remains the same, whereas in the present<br>
process and device it varies substantially within the device.<br>
iv. In case of the known cyclonic type separators the cleaning or<br>
separation of the dust is affected by creating the different kinetic<br>
energy between dust and flue gases by enhancing the kinetic energy in<br>
the dust particulate matter, whereas in the present process and device it<br>
is also based on reducing the kinetic energy imparted in the flue gases.<br>
Thus increasing the gap between the kinetic energy level of gas and<br>
particulate matter.<br>
v. In case of ESP the dust is trapped due to electrostatic charge and in<br>
case of wet scrubber due to hygroscopic charge, whereas in the present<br>
process and device there is no electrostatic charge, even hygroscopic<br>
charge is very little, not as much as compared to the wet scrubbing.<br>
vi. In most of the presently known process cooling and cleaning is done<br>
separately, but in the present device cooling and cleaning is done<br>
simultaneously.<br>
vii. In none of the known device the flue gas is reheated, whereas in the<br>
present device the flue gas is reheated.<br>

combustion air through a combustion air nozzle located at the upper segment of<br>
chimney or by creating a self air suction port at this level of chimney to combust the un-<br>
combusted part of reheated cleaned flue gases, which further increases the<br>
temperature of the flue gases which results into better chimney draft.<br>
30.	A process as claimed in any of claims 19 to 29 optionally comprising pre-cleaning and<br>
pre-cooling in case of temperature of the process/flue gas is above 900°C and the dust<br>
load also is above 50 gm/NM3 by conventional devices.<br>
31.	A cleaning device and process for hot dust laden flue/process gases as described<br>
herein and illustrated with reference to accompanying drawings<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Title : DEVICE AND PROCESS FOR CLEANING HOT FLUE GASES<br>
ABSTRACT<br>
A cleaning device for hot dust laden flue/process gases comprising means for<br>
receiving hot flue gas; at least one vertical hollow gas flow path or channel for the hot<br>
dust laden flue gas with inlet at top and outlet at bottom ; at least one hollow gas flow<br>
path or channel for the cooled cleaned flue gas <br>
with inlet at bottom and outlet at top<br>
arranged adjacent to the said flow path or channel for hot flue gas; the adjacent walls<br><br>
of the said channels being made of thermally <br>
conducting material with or without<br>
intervening non conducting zones; means for <br>
receiving dust placed below the said<br>
channels; means for emission of cleaned flue gas. A process for such cleaning<br>
comprising receiving hot dust laden flue gas by means for receiving hot flue gas and<br>
transferring to vertical hollow gas flow path or channel for hot flue gas ; downward<br>
passing the hot dust laden flue gas through said channel by inlet at top and outlet at<br>
the bottom; upward passing of the cleaned gas after removal of dust and taking 'u"<br>
turn from the outlet of the hot flue channel to the inlet of the channel for the cooled<br>
cleaned flue gas with inlet at bottom and outlet at top arranged adjacent to the said<br>
flow path or channel for hot flue gas; simultaneous dissipation of heat through the<br>
adjacent walls of the said channels being made of thermally conducting material with<br>
or without intervening non conducting zones causing decrease in viscosity of the dust<br>
laden gases from top to bottom; separation of dust and agglomerated particles from<br>
the hot flue gas by gravity and arresting the same in the means placed below the said<br>
channels; directing the cleaned flue gases from the cold flue channels for emission<br>
through means for emission of cleaned flue gas.<br></td>
