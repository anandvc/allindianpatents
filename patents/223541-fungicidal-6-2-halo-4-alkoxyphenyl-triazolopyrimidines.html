The resulting 57-dihydroxy-6-(2-halo-4-alkoxyphenyl)-triazolopyrimidine of formula VII<br><br>
is subsequently treated with a halogenating agent, preferably with a brominating or chlorinating agent, such as phosphorus oxybromide or phosphorus oxychloride, either neat or in the presence of a solvent and/or a base. The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from about 0 C to about 150 . the preferred reaction temperature being from about 80 'C to about 125 as disclosed for example by EP 0 770 615.<br><br>

The reaction between the 5.7-dihalo-6-(2-halo-4-alkoxyphenyl)-triazotopyrimidines of formula II and the amine of formula III is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as dioxane, diethyl ether and, especially, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene. The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the approximate range from 0 °C to 70 'C, the preferred reaction temperature being approximately from 10 'C to 35 C. It is also preferred that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, and inorganic bases, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. Alternatively, an excess of the compound of formula III may serve as a base.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be used in cultivation of all plants where infection by phytopathogenic fungi is not desired, e.g. cereals, solanaceous crops, vegetables, legumes, apples, vine.<br>
The invention further provides a fungicidal composition which comprises an active ingredient, which is at least one compound of formula I as defined above, and one or more carriers. A method of making such a composition is also within the scope of the invention. This method comprises bringing a compound of formula I as defined above into association with the carrier(s). Such a composition may contain a single active ingredient or a mixture of several active ingredients of the present invention. It is also envisaged that different isomers or mixtures of isomers may have different levels or spectra of activity and, thus, compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers.<br><br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from about 0.5% to about 95% by weight (w/w) of active ingredient.<br>
A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is fonnulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated (which may, for example, be a plant, seed, soil, or water in which a plant grows), or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A earner may be a solid or a liquid, including material which is normally a gas but which has been compressed to form a liquid.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be manufactured into, e.g., emulsion or emulsifiabie concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions. wettable powders, soluble powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, micro-capsules, gels, tablets, aerosols and other formulation types by well-established procedures. These procedures include intensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as fillers, solvents, solid carriers, surface active compounds (surfactants), and optionally solid and/or liquid auxiliaries and/or adjuvants. The form of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pouring, may be chosen according to the desired objectives and the given circumstances.<br>
Solvents may be aromatic hydrocaribons, e.g. Solvesso® 200, substituted naphthalenes, phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl or dioctyi phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e.g. ethanol. ethylenegiycol mono- and dimethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyn'olidone. or y-butyrolactone. higher alkyl pyrrolidones, e.g. n-octylpyrrolidone or cyclohexylpyrrolidone, epoxidized plant oil esters, e.g. methylated coconut or soybean oil ester, and water. Mixtures of different solvents are often suitable.<br>
Solid carriers, which may be used for dusts, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, or granules, may be mineral fillers, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. The physical properties may be improved by addition of highly dispersed silica gel or polymers. Carriers for<br><br>
granules may be porous material, e.g. pumice, kaolin, sepiolite. bentonite; non-sorptive carriers may be calcite or sand. Additionally, a multitude of pre-granuiated inorganic or organic materials may be used, such as dolomite or crushed plant residues.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated fomi which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a earner which is a surfactant facilitates this process of dilution. Thus, preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the Invention is a surfactant. For example, the composition may contain at two or more carriers, at least one of which is a surfactant.<br>
Surfactants may be nonionic, anionic, cationic or zwittenonic substances with good dispersing, emulsifying and wetting properties depending on the nature of the compound according to formula I to be formulated. Surfactants in this invention may also include mixtures of individual surfactants.<br>
Wettable powders suitably contain about 5 to 90% w/w of active ingredient, and in addition to solid inert carrier, about 3 to10% w/w of dispersing and wetting agents and about 0 to 10% w/w of stabiiizer(s) and/or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts may be formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder, but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition preferably containing about 0.5 to 10% w/w of active ingredient. Water dispersible granules and granules of the invention preferably have a size between about 0.15 mm and 2.0 mm and may be manufactured by a variety of techniques. These granules preferably contain about 0.5 to 90% w/w active ingredient and about 0 to 20% w/w of additives such as stabilizer, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates of the invention suitably contain, in addition to a solvent or a mixture of solvents, about 1 to 80% w/v active ingredient, about 2 to 20% w/v emulsifiers and about 0 to 20% w/v of other additives such as stabilizers, penetrants and corrosion<br><br>
inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are preferably milled so as to obtain a stable, non-sedimenting flowable product and usually contain about 5 to • 75% w/v active ingredient, about 0.5 to 15% w/v of dispersing agents, about 0.1 to 10% w/v of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, about 0 to 10% w/v of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble; certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation and crystalization or as antifreeze agents.<br>
Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting the formulated product according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, to enhance the duration of the protective activity of the compounds of this invention, a carrier is used which provides slow release of the pesticidal compounds into the environment of a plant which is to be protected.<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient may be increased by including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient but is not itself significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added separately, e.g., to a spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient.<br>
As a commodity, the compositions preferably may be in a concentrated form, whereas the end user generally employs diluted compositions. The compositions may be diluted to a concentration down to about 0.001% of active ingredient. The doses usually are in the approximate range from 0.01 to 10 kg a.i./ha.<br>
Examples of formulations according to the invention are:<br><br><br><br><br>
The compositions of this invention can be applied to the plants or their environment, either simultaneously with, or in succession with, other active substances. These other active substances may include fertilisers, agents which donate trace elements, or other preparations which influence plant growth. However, they also include selective herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, aigicides, molluscicides, rodenticides, virucides, compounds inducing resistance into plants, biological control agents such as viruses, bacteria, nematodes, fungi and other microorganisms, repellents of birds and animals, and plant growth regulators, or mixtures of several of these substances, optionally together<br><br>
with other earner substances conventionally used in the art of formulation, including surfactants or other additives which promote application.<br>
Furthermore, the other pesticide can have a synergistic effect on the pesticidai activity of the compound of formula 1.<br>
The other fungicidal compound can be, for example, one which is also capable of combating diseases of cereals (e.g. wheat) such as those caused by Erysipha, Puccinia, Septoria, Gibberella and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne diseases and downy and powdery mildews on vines, early and late blight on soianaceous crops, and powdery mildew and scab on apples etc. These mixtures of fungicides can have a broader spectrum of activity than the compound of formula I alone. Furthermore, the other fungicide can have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activities of the compound of formula I.<br>
