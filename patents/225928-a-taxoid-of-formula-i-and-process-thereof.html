The compounds of formula (I) in which 2<br><br>
represents a radical of formula (II) display noteworthy biological properties.<br>
In vitro, measurement of the biological activity is performed on tubulin extracted from pig's brain by the method of M.L. Shelanski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 70, 765-768 (1973). Study of the depolymerization of microtubules to tubulin is performed according to the method of G. Chauviere et al., C.R. Acad. Sci., 293, series II, 501-503 (1981). In this study, the compounds of formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of formula (II) were shown to be at least as active as taxol and Taxotere.<br>
In vivo, the compounds of formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of formula (II) were shown to be active in mice grafted with B16 melanoma at doses of between 1 and 10 mg/kg administered<br>
intraperitoneally, as well as on other liquid or solid tumours.<br>
The compounds have antitumour properties, and more especially activity against tumours which are resistant to TaxolÂ® or to Taxotere^. Such tumours are, for example, colon tumours which have a high expression of the mdr 1 gene (multiple drug resistance gene). Multiple drug resistance is a customary term relating to the resistance of a tumour to different compounds having different structures and mechanisms of action. Taxoids are generally known to be strongly recognized by experimental tumours such as P388/DOX, a cell line<br><br>
selected for its resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) which expresses mdr 1.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the present invention. EXAMPLE 1<br>

disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation. The active compound according to the invention may be administered as often as necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to relatively high or low dosages, and then require low or zero maintenance dosages. Generally/ low dosages will be used at the beginning of the treatment and, if necessary, increasingly stronger doses will be administered until an optimum effect is obtained. For other patients, it may be necessary to administer maintenance dosages 1 to 8 times a day, and preferably 1 to 4 times, according to the physiological requirements of the patient in question. It is also possible that some patients may require the use of only one to two daily administrations.<br>
In man, the dosages are generally between 0.01 and 200 mg/kg. For intraperitoneal administration, the dosages will generally be between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg, preferably between 0.5 and 50 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 10 mg/kg. For intravenous administration, the dosages are generally between 0.1 and 50 mg/kg, preferably between 0.1 and 5 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 2 mg/kg. It is understood that, in order to choose the most suitable dosage, account should be taken of the administration route, the patient's weight, general state of health and age and all factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment.<br><br>
The example which follows illustrates a composition according to the invention. EXAMPLE 5<br>
40 mg of the product obtained in Example l are dissolved in 1 cm3 of Emulphor EL 620 and I cm3 of ethanol, and the solution is then diluted by adding 18 cm3 of physiological saline.<br>
The composition is administered by perfusion over 1 hour by introduction in physiological solution.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
