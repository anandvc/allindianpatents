				<td>ON-LINE SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL OF FUEL CELL<br>
HUMIDIFICATION VIA HFR MEASUREMENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell system and, more particularly,<br>
to a fuel cell stack hydration measurement system and method for measuring the<br>
hydration of the fuel cell stack in operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient, and environmentally<br>
responsible energy source for electric vehicles and various other applications. In<br>
particular, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for the<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles. One type of fuel<br>
cell is known as a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Individual fuel<br>
cells can be stacked together in series to form a fuel cell stack. The fuel cell<br>
stack is capable of supplying a quantity of electricity sufficient to provide power to<br>
a vehicle.<br>
[0003] As is well understood in the art, the membranes within the fuel cell stack<br>
must have a certain relative humidity (RH) for efficient performance. Measures<br>
are often taken to maintain the membrane hydration within a desired range that<br>
optimizes proton conduction across the membranes. For example, in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,376,111, hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, a<br>
controller utilizes feedback to control the humidity of a fuel cell assembly.<br>
Humidifiers or water vapor transfer (WVT) devices are commonly used to<br>
humidify inlet reactant gases provided to the fuel cell stack. Thermal control<br>
strategies based on a relationship between RH and fuel cell temperature, as<br>
measured by the coolant temperature, for example, have also been employed in<br>
controlling membrane hydration. Other fuel cell parameters, such as<br>
stoichiometry and pressure, are further known to affect fuel cell humidification.<br>
[0004] The level of humidification in fuel cell systems of the art has been<br>
controlled in response to a variety of feedback indicators including inlet RH,<br><br>
outlet RH, temperature, pressure, flow rate, and electrical current measurements.<br>
However, typical sensors employed in measuring these indicators often exhibit<br>
drift and may be unreliable. Relative humidity sensors, in particular, are known<br>
to have limited use in fuel cell applications due to corrosion and swelling of the<br>
sensors with repeated exposure to liquid water. Thus, typical sensors have not<br>
been desirably effective for purposes of humidification feedback-control in fuel<br>
cell systems.<br>
[0005] High frequency resistance (HFR) has previously been used as an offline<br>
lab diagnostic technique for indirectly measuring MEA hydration in the fuel cell.<br>
Typical HFR sensors measure an AC resistance of the fuel cell based on a high-<br>
frequency ripple current. HFR is particularly sensitive to changes in RH.<br>
However, HFR is also highly sensitive to other fuel cell conditions, such as<br>
individual differences in overall membrane resistance, plate resistance, and<br>
contact resistance. Absolute HFR measurements are particularly susceptible to<br>
variation in contact resistance. Since the contact resistance of a fuel cell stack<br>
varies during operation with changes in compression force, due in part to<br>
swelling and contracting of membranes, absolute HFR measurements have<br>
heretofore not been employable in online hydration measurements of operating<br>
fuel cell stacks.<br>
[0006] There is a continuing need for an online system and method for reliably<br>
measuring humidification of the fuel cell stack in operation. Desirably, the online<br>
system and method employs HFR measurements for monitoring and feedback<br>
control of fuel cell stack humidification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In concordance with the instant disclosure, an online system and method<br>
that employs HFR measurements for reliably monitoring and controlling<br>
humidification of the fuel cell stack in operation, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a fuel cell system includes a fuel cell stack with a<br>
plurality of fuel cells. Each of the fuel cells has an electrolyte membrane<br>
disposed between an anode and a cathode. The fuel cell system further includes<br><br>
an HFR measurement device in electrical communication with the fuel cell stack.<br>
The HFR measurement device is adapted to measure an HFR of the fuel cell<br>
stack suitable for calculation of a d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio. A humidity regulator is in<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack and adapted to adjust an RH thereof to<br>
within a desired range. A controller is also in electrical communication with the<br>
HFR measurement device and the humidity regulator. The controller is adapted<br>
to control the humidity regulator in response to the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, a method for online identification of a fuel cell<br>
stack humidification level includes the steps of supplying a reactant stream to the<br>
fuel cell stack and introducing a perturbation in the reactant stream. The<br>
perturbation is adapted to provide a transient deviation in an RH of the fuel cell<br>
stack. The HFR of the fuel cell stack is measured during the perturbation. A<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is calculated from the measured HFR and the transient<br>
deviation in the RH of the fuel cell stack. The d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is correlated in<br>
a mathematical model to identify an RH of the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0010] In a further embodiment, the method includes the step of controlling the<br>
humidification level of the fuel cell stack in response to the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio.<br>
The RH of the fuel cell stack is thereby maintained within a desired range<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0020] FIG. 1 is an exemplary illustration of a fuel cell 2 known in the art. A<br>
skilled artisan should appreciate that other fuel cell designs may be used within<br>
the scope of the present disclosure. The fuel cell 2 includes a membrane<br>
electrode assembly (MEA) 4 having a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) 6, a<br>
cathode 8, and an anode 10. The PEM 6 is sandwiched between the cathode 8<br>
and the anode 10. The cathode 8 and the anode 10 typically include a finely<br>
divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon particles and mixed with<br>
an ionomer. It should be appreciated that the cathode 8 and the anode 10 may<br>
be formed from other suitable materials as desired.<br>
[0021] A first gas diffusion medium (GDM) layer 12 is disposed adjacent the<br>
cathode 8 on a side opposite the PEM 6. A second GDM layer 14 is disposed<br>
adjacent the anode 10 on a side opposite the PEM 6. The GDM layers 12, 14<br>
typically facilitate a delivery of gaseous reactants, such as air (O2) and hydrogen<br><br>
(H2), to the MEA 4 for an electrochemical fuel cell reaction. The electrochemical<br>
fuel cell reaction produces electricity and water as a chemical product. The fuel<br>
cell stack 2 further includes a first plate 16 and a second plate 18 disposed<br>
adjacent the first and second GDM layers 12, 14, respectively. The first and<br>
second plates 16, 18 have flow channels formed therein for distribution of air (O2)<br>
to the cathode 8 and hydrogen (H2) to the anode 10 and for removing residual<br>
reactants and the product water from the fuel cell 2. In particular embodiments,<br>
the first and second plates 16, 18 are typically at least one of a unipolar plate and<br>
a bipolar plate.<br>
[0022] As shown in FIG. 2, a fuel cell system 200 of the present disclosure<br>
includes a fuel cell stack 202. The fuel cell stack 202 is assembled from a<br>
plurality of the fuel cells 2, for example. The fuel cell system 200 may include<br>
more than one fuel cell stack 202 if desired. The fuel cell stack 202 is in<br>
electrical communication with an electrical load 204. The electrical load 204 may<br>
be, for example, an electric drive motor of an electric vehicle.<br>
[0023] The fuel cell stack 202 is in fluid communication with a reactant source<br>
206. The reactant source 206 provides a reactant stream 207, such as one of a<br>
cathode stream and an anode stream, to the fuel cell stack 202 for the<br>
electrochemical fuel cell reaction. In a particular embodiment, the reactant<br>
source 206 is an air compressor adapted to provide compressed air from the<br>
ambient atmosphere to the cathodes 8 of the fuel cell stack 202. Likewise, the<br>
reactant source 206 may be a storage vessel adapted to provide hydrogen gas to<br>
the anodes 10 of the fuel cell stack 202.<br>
[0024] In one embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes a humidity regulator,<br>
such as a thermal control unit 208 and a water vapor transfer (WVT) unit 210. As<br>
a nonlimiting example, the thermal control unit 208 is in a heat exchange<br>
relationship with a coolant stream 211 supplied to the fuel cell stack 202. The<br>
coolant stream may circulate through the fuel cell stack 202 and adjust a<br>
temperature, and thereby a relative humidity (RH), of the fuel cell stack 202. As<br>
used herein, the RH of the fuel cell stack 202 means an RH of the gases in the<br>
fuel cell stack 202, as indicated by an "outlet RH" of exhausted residual gaseous<br><br>
reactants and products, for example. As is known in the art, the thermal control<br>
unit 212 may be employed to adjust a temperature of the coolant stream 213 to a<br>
desired setpoint selected to maintain the RH of the fuel cell stack 202 within a<br>
desired range.<br>
[0025] In a further embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes the WVT unit<br>
210. The WVT unit 210 is adapted to adjust an RH of the reactant stream 207<br>
supplied to the fuel cell stack 202 as desired. The WVT unit 210 may be a<br>
humidifier, for example, that transfers water vapor from a water source. As a<br>
further nonlimiting example, the WVT unit 210 extracts water from a water-<br>
carrying stream of the fuel cell system 202, such as from one of an anode<br>
exhaust stream, a cathode exhaust stream, and a reformate stream. The WVT<br>
unit 210 may employ a water-transfer membrane. In another nonlimiting<br>
example, the WVT unit 210 transfers water vapor from a reservoir of liquid water.<br>
Suitable WVT units 210 are known in the art, and may be used as desired. One<br>
of ordinary skill should appreciate that the fuel cell system 200 may include one<br>
or both the thermal control unit 208 and the WVT unit 210.<br>
[0026] The fuel cell system 200 also includes a controller 212 and a high<br>
frequency resistance (HFR) measurement device 214. The controller 212 of the<br>
fuel cell system 200 is in electrical communication with the HFR measurement<br>
device 214. The controller 212 of the fuel cell system may also be in electrical<br>
communication with the thermal control unit 208 and the WVT unit 210. The<br>
HFR measurement device 214 is in electrical communication with the fuel cell<br>
stack 202 and is adapted to measure an HFR of the fuel cell stack 202 suitable<br>
for calculation of a d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio, further explained herein below.<br>
[0027] As shown in FIG. 3, different fuel cell stacks 202 having substantially<br>
identical operating conditions often provide offset absolute HFR values 300 and<br>
302. This is typically due to individual differences in overall plate and contact<br>
resistance. As shown in FIG. 4, an increase in fuel cell stack 202 humidity, and<br>
a corresponding hydration of the PEM 6, results in a decrease in the absolute<br>
HFR measurements. However, the absolute HFR measurements also vary<br>
significantly between different operating temperatures. It is now recognized that<br><br>
a slope of the absolute HFR measurements over the range of RH levels, or the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio, is substantially the same regardless of individual differences<br>
in overall plate and contact resistance. The slope directly measures the change<br>
in membrane resistance due to hydration while plate and contact resistance<br>
remain constant.<br>
[0028] The employment of the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is particularly useful as an<br>
indicator of the RH of the fuel cell stack 202 in operation. The dynamic<br>
relationship of the RH of the fuel cell stack 202 to the HFR measurement can be<br>
expressed as the following transfer function:<br><br>
and τp is a time period of the process. As shown in FIG. 4, the slope Kp (the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio) decreases as indicated by HFR slopes 400, 402, 404, 406 to<br>
a minimum 408 of about zero in the fuel cell stack 202 when fully humidified.<br>
Although the d(HFR)d(RH) ratio is nominally affected by temperature, as shown<br>
by d(HFR)/d(RH) slopes 500, 502, 504, 506 in FIG. 5, the d(HFR)d(RH) ratio is<br>
not substantially affected by individual differences in overall membrane<br>
resistance, plate resistance, and contact resistance. Therefore, the employment<br>
of the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio instead of the absolute HFR measurement for<br>
estimating RH of the fuel cell stack 202 is particularly advantageous.<br>
[0029] With renewed reference to FIG. 2, the HFR measurement device 214 of<br>
the disclosure may be any known device suitable for measuring HFR of fuel cells<br>
or fuel cell components. The HFR measuring device is adapted to measure the<br>
HFR across at least one of the PEMs 6 of the fuel cell stack 202. As a<br>
nonlimiting example, the HFR measurement device 214 is in independent<br>
electrical communication with one or more of the fuel cells 2 of the fuel cell stack<br><br>
202. The HFR of the at least one of the PEMs 6 is representative of the level of<br>
humidification of the fuel cell stack 214 as a whole. The HFR measurement<br>
device 214 is adapted to measure the HFR across at least a portion of the entire<br>
fuel cell stack 202. For example, the HFR measurement device 214 is in<br>
electrical communication with a first terminal and a second terminal of the fuel<br>
cell stack 202. A skilled artisan should appreciate that other configurations of the<br>
HFR measurement device 214 for measuring the HFR of the fuel cell stack 202<br>
may be selected as desired.<br>
[0030] The controller 212 is configured to receive at least one of the HFR<br>
measurement and the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio calculated therefrom by way of the<br>
HFR measurement device 214. For example, the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio may be<br>
pre-calculated from one or more HFR measurements made by the HFR<br>
measurement device 214 and then provided to the controller 212. In another<br>
embodiment, the controller 212 may include a function that calculates the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio with the one or more HFR measurements.<br>
[0031] It should be appreciated that the controller 212 is adapted to periodically<br>
change the operating conditions of the fuel cell stack 202. For example, the<br>
controller 12 may be adapted to adjust the fuel cell stack 202 humidification<br>
based on the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio. A hydration of the PEMs 6 is thereby<br>
controlled to within the desired range. As a further example, the controller 212<br>
may be adapted to control the humidity regulator in response to the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio. The controller 212 employs at least one algorithm or<br>
mathematical model that correlates the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio to an estimate of the<br>
RH, such as an outlet RH, of the fuel cell stack 202. The mathematical model<br>
may be a lookup table of d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio values and outlet RH values for a<br>
particular fuel cell stack 202 architecture and operating temperature, for example.<br>
Calculations using the mathematical model are performed in real-time, enabling<br>
the online measurement of the fuel cell stack 202 hydration. As a nonlimiting<br>
example, the mathematical model may include a standard recursive least-<br>
squares estimator with exponential forgetting, as is known in the art. It should be<br><br>
understood that other suitable algorithms or mathematical models for correlating<br>
the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio to an estimate of the relative humidity may be employed.<br>
[0032] The fuel cell system 200 may further include at least one additional sensor<br>
(not shown). The additional sensor may be in electrical communication with the<br>
controller 212. The additional sensor is adapted to monitor at least one of the<br>
inlet RH, outlet RH, fuel cell stack pressure, and fuel cell stack temperature. In<br>
particular embodiments, the additional sensor is a temperature sensor adapted to<br>
provide temperature measurements to the controller 212 of the fuel cell system<br>
200. Other suitable sensors and configurations for measuring the fuel cell<br>
system 200 may be selected as desired.<br>
[0033] The present disclosure further includes a method for online determination<br>
of the fuel cell stack 202 humidification. The method includes the step of<br>
providing the fuel cell stack 202 in electrical communication with the HFR<br>
measurement device 214 as described herein. The reactant stream 207, such as<br>
a cathode supply stream, for example, is supplied to the fuel cell stack 202.<br>
Following the step of supplying the reactant stream 207 to the fuel cell stack 202,<br>
a perturbation in the reactant stream 207 is introduced. As a nonlimiting<br>
example, the perturbation is a change in a stoichiometry of the reactant stream,<br>
such as a change in cathode stoichiometry. The change in stoichiometry may be<br>
performed, for example, by effecting a change in a flow rate of the reactant<br>
stream 207 to the fuel cell stack 202. Other suitable means for modifying the<br>
reactant stream stoichiometry may be employed as desired.<br>
[0034] The perturbation introduced in the reactant stream 207 is adapted to<br>
provide a transient deviation in an RH of the fuel cell stack 202. From the<br>
perturbation, a system gain in HFR results. A d(HFR) value is derived from the<br>
system gain in HFR. The transient deviation in the RH is also a substantially<br>
known quantity from which d(RH) may be derived, further enabling the<br>
calculation of the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio. In particular embodiments, the<br>
perturbation occurs at substantially regular intervals during the step of supplying<br>
the reactant stream 207 to the fuel cell stack 202. The perturbation may be a<br>
substantially constant pulse or an irregular pulse, as desired. For example, the<br><br>
irregular perturbation may result in an initial decrease in the RH followed by a<br>
subsequent increase in RH, both in relation to a steady state RH of the fuel cell<br>
stack 202.<br>
[0035] A magnitude of the transient variation resulting from the perturbation is<br>
typically a fraction of the steady state RH of the fuel cell stack 202. The<br>
magnitude is selected to militate against any significant impact on the fuel cell<br>
stack 202 performance due to the perturbation. Illustratively, the magnitude of<br>
the transient variation resulting from the perturbation is less than about 20% from<br>
the steady state RH of the fuel cell stack 202. In a further embodiment, the<br>
magnitude of the transient variation is less than about 10% from the steady state<br>
RH. In a particularly illustrative embodiment, the magnitude of the transient<br>
variation is less than about 5% from the steady state RH. A skilled artisan should<br>
understand that a suitable magnitude not substantially deviating from the fuel cell<br>
stack 202 steady state RH may be selected as desired.<br>
[0036] The transient variation in RH also occurs for a time period selected that<br>
does not substantially impact the performance of the fuel cell stack 202. For<br>
example, the transient variation in RH may be for a time period less than about<br>
90 seconds. In one embodiment, the transient variation in RH is for a time period<br>
less than about 10 seconds. In a particularly illustrative embodiment, the<br>
transient variation in RH is for a time period less than about 5 seconds. It should<br>
be appreciated that the transient variation and time period are selected to<br>
minimize the impact on the fuel cell stack 202 performance, yet be sufficient for<br>
derivation of the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio therefrom. For example, the transient<br>
variation provides a signal-to-noise ratio that allows a measurable HFR<br>
response.<br>
[0037] Following the introduction of the perturbation to the reactant stream 207,<br>
the HFR of the fuel cell stack 202 is measured by the HFR measurement device<br>
214. From the measured change in HFR and the known transient variation in RH<br>
of the fuel cell stack 202 during the perturbation, the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is<br>
calculated. As a nonlimiting example, if the change in HFR is about -0.035 -<br>
cm2 and the transient deviation in RH is about 40%, at a fixed operating<br><br>
temperature and time period, then the calculated d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is about -<br>
0.9 m-cm2/%. The d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio may then be correlated in the<br>
mathematical model to RH, such as known outlet RH values of the fuel cell stack<br>
202. The RH of the fuel cell stack 202 is thereby identified.<br>
[0038] It should be understood that system metrics based on the d(HFR)/d(RH)<br>
ratio and the operating temperature of the fuel cell stack may be employed by the<br>
controller 212 to determine the humidification level of the fuel cell stack 202. In<br>
one embodiment, an optimized fuel cell stack 202 humidification may be<br>
indicated when the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is between a desired lower limit and a<br>
desired upper limit. An under-humidified or "dry" fuel cell stack is indicated when<br>
the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is less than the desired lower limit, for example. An over-<br>
humidified or "flooded" fuel cell stack is indicated when the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio is<br>
greater than the desired upper limit, for example. A skilled artisan should<br>
appreciated that the desired upper and lower limits for the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio<br>
may be selected as desired, based at least in part on operating temperature and<br>
the particular fuel cell stack 202 architecture.<br>
[0039] The present method may also be employed for controlling the fuel cell<br>
stack 202 humidification. The method may include the step of controlling the RH<br>
of the fuel cell stack 202 in response to the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio. For example,<br>
the system metrics including the desired upper and lower limits for the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio may be employed by the controller 212 to operate the<br>
humidity regulator. The metrics may be "fuzzy" metrics, for example, such as<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratios associated with "very dry," "dry", "normal," and "flooded,"<br>
humidity conditions. The level of humidification of the fuel cell stack 202 is<br>
thereby regulated.<br>
[0040] In one embodiment where the thermal control unit 208 is provided, the<br>
step of controlling the RH includes the step of determining a desired fuel cell<br>
stack temperature for providing the RH within the desired range. The desired<br>
fuel cell stack temperature is selected based on the calculated d(HFR)/d(RH)<br>
ratio. The coolant stream 211 may be supplied to the fuel cell stack and a<br>
temperature of the coolant stream 211 regulated to a temperature setpoint<br><br>
providing the desired fuel cell stack 202 temperature. The RH of the fuel cell<br>
stack 202 is thereby maintained within the desired range when the desired fuel<br>
cell stack 202 temperature is achieved,<br>
[0041] When the WVT unit 210 is provided in fuel cell system 200, the step of<br>
controlling the RH of the fuel cell stack 202 may include regulating an RH of the<br>
reactant stream 207. The change of the RH of the reactant stream 207 directly<br>
impacts the humidification of the fuel celi stack 202, and therefore, the hydration<br>
of the PEMs 6. The RH of the fuel cell stack 202 may thereby be maintained<br>
within the desired range.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0042] As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, HFR measurements were obtained from<br>
exemplary fuel cell modules in accordance with the present disclosure. It should<br>
be appreciated that the present disclosure is not limited by the examples<br>
described herein.<br>
[0043] In a first example illustrated in FIG. 6, a perturbation 600 was introduced<br>
in the cathode stream of a fuel cell module. The fuel cell module was operating<br>
under drier than normal humidity conditions, at an operating temperature of about<br>
80°C. The perturbation 600 resulted in a transient variation 602 from a steady<br>
state outlet RH of about 70%. The transient variation 602 was an irregular pulse<br>
that was initially about -5% from the steady state and ended about +10% from<br>
the steady state. The magnitude of the resulting transient variation 602 was<br>
about 15%. The time period for the perturbation 600 was about 90 seconds. A<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio of about -2 m-cm2/% for the fuel cell architecture was<br>
therefore determined to be indicative of "dry" humidification level at an operating<br>
temperature of about 80°C.<br>
[0044] In a second example, a perturbation 700 was introduced in the cathode<br>
stream of a second fuel cell module under normally humidified conditions. As<br>
shown in FIG. 7, the perturbation 700 resulted in a transient variation 702 from a<br>
steady state outlet RH of about 80%. The magnitude of the resulting transient<br>
variation 702 was between about -10% and +20%, or about 40% total. The time<br><br>
period for the perturbation was about 90 seconds. A d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio of about<br>
-0.8 m-cm2/% for the fuel cell module architecture was therefore determined to<br>
be indicative of a "normal" humidification level, at an operating temperature of<br>
about 80°C.<br>
[0045] It is surprisingly found that the d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio allows for the<br>
estimation of the fuel cell stack 202 humidification, and hence, hydration of the<br>
PEMs 6 of the fuel cell stack 202. Therefore, the use of HFR measurements for<br>
online determination and control of the fuel cell stack 202 humidification is<br>
enabled with the fuel cell system 200 and methods of the present disclosure.<br>
[0046] The d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio may also be used with other humidity sensors<br>
known in the art. The estimation of the fuel cell stack 202 humidification with the<br>
d(HFR)/d(RH) ratio may be employed to diagnose faults in the humidity sensors<br>
which would otherwise cause improper humidification of the fuel cell stack 202.<br>
Thus, the use of HFR measurements as described herein may be employed for<br>
system redundancy purposes, particularly in a vehicle powered by the fuel cell<br>
stack 202.<br>
[0047] As the present system and methods facilitate humidification detection and<br>
control, the fuel cell stack 202 effective life and durability is optimized. It should<br>
also be appreciated that the use of HFR measurements in an online system for<br>
measuring and controlling humidification may be particularly useful for multi-stack<br>
systems where humidification imbalances occasionally occur. The system and<br>
methods of the present disclosure may be used to detect such imbalances,<br>
correct them, and alert the operator as desired.<br>
[0048] While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown<br>
for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
disclosure, which is further described in the following appended claims.<br><br>
