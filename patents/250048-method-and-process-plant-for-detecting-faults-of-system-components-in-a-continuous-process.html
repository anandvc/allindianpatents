				<td>[0001] This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.<br>
No. 60/511,998 filed on October 16, 2003, entitled "A Method For Detecting Leaks In<br>
Tubes Of Steam Boilers" the contents of which are relied upon and incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entirety, and the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) is<br>
hereby claimed.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] This invention relates to a method and process plant for detecting<br>
faults of system components in a continuous process, such as steam<br>
generators and more particularly to the detection of a fault in a component<br>
of the continuous process.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] A continuous process system such as a steam generator process has many<br>
components. The steam generator system includes a boiler that has tubes through<br>
which water flows. Because of heat, pressure, and wear over time, the boiler tubes<br>
eventually begin to leak, i.e., the beginning of a "leak event." When a boiler tube(s)<br>
starts to leak, steam which flashes over from the water escaping through the leak<br>
therein is lost to the boiler environment. In general, the amount of leaked water/steam<br>
may be small at the inception of a tube leak event. However, unless the tube is<br>
repaired, the leak will continue to grow, i.e., the tube leak rate increases with time until<br>
the tube eventually ruptures. Further a rupture in one tube may damage adjacent tubes<br>
resulting in a huge overall leak. Thus, once a rupture occurs the utility operating the<br>
boiler is forced to shut the boiler down immediately.<br>
[0004] Boiler tube failures are a major cause of forced shut downs in fossil power<br>
plants. For example, approximately 41,000 tube failures occur every year in the United<br>
States alone. The cost of these failures proves to be quite expensive for utilities,<br>
exceeding $5 billion a year. [Lind, M. H., "Boiler Tube Leak Detection System,"<br><br>
Proceedings of the Third EPRI Incipient-Failure Detection Conference, EPRI CS-5395,<br>
March 1987].<br>
[0005] In order to reduce the occurrences of such forced outages, early boiler tube<br>
leak detection is highly desirable. Early boiler tube leak detection would allow utilities to<br>
schedule a repair at a convenient time rather than to suffer a later forced outage. In<br>
addition, the earlier the detection, the better the chances are of limiting damage to<br>
adjacent tubes. Additional savings that result from early detection of boiler tube leaks<br>
accrue from items such as:<br>
1)	Shorter period of heat rate degradation;<br>
2)	Less ancillary damage caused by the leakage; and<br>
3)	Potential that the leak itself will be smaller if caught sooner.<br>
[0006] Various methods are described in the prior art to detect boiler tube leaks.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,567,795 and 6,192,352 describe a method that uses neural<br>
networks and fuzzy math. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,847,266 and 5,363,693 describe a<br>
method that uses input/output comparison. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,960,079 and 4,640,121<br>
describe acoustical methods. None of the prior art methods work well due to poor<br>
model fidelity and inadequate fault tolerance. For example the acoustical method which<br>
detects the noise made by the leaking water must compete with the noisy environment<br>
present in the power house. Therefore, the result of the prior art methods are either<br>
numerous false alarms or real tube leaks that are not detected.<br><br>
i<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a diagram of a process 100 which is<br>
the water/steam side of a boiler/turbine power cycle. As is well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, the water/steam side process 100 includes a steam generator<br>
102, a high pressure turbine 104, an intermediate pressure turbine 106, a low pressure<br>
turbine 108, a generator 110, a make-up tank 112, a condenser 114, a low pressure<br>
feedwater heater 116, an intermediate pressure feedwater heater 118, a de-aerator<br>
feedwater heater 120, a high pressure feedwater heater 122, a condensate pump 124<br>
and a boiler feed pump 126. While only one low pressure feedwater heater 116, one<br>
intermediate pressure feedwater heater 118 and one high pressure feedwater heater<br>
122 are shown in Fig. 1, it should be appreciated that there are usually multiple heaters<br>
116, 118 and 122 and that one heater is shown in Fig. 1 solely for convenience of<br>
illustration. It should also be appreciated that in some plants, heater 118 is located<br>
between heater 122 and boiler feed pump 126.<br>
[0020] There is also associated with process 100 several types of sensors such as<br>
pressure sensors, temperature sensors, flow sensors and power or miscellaneous<br>
sensors. One or more of these sensors are at the measurement locations 1 to 24 in<br>
process 100. The table in Fig. 1a shows which of the sensors are at each of the<br>
locations 1 to 24.<br>
[0021] In process 100, steam generator 102 generates high pressure steam. The<br>
high pressure steam, augmented by main steam spray, is fed to the high pressure<br>
turbine 104. Expanded steam from the high pressure turbine 104 is fed back to the<br>
steam generator 102 where it is reheated. The reheated steam, augmented by reheat<br>
spray, is fed to intermediate pressure turbine 106 and through that turbine to low<br>
pressure turbine 108. The steam from the low pressure turbine 108 is fed to condenser<br>
114 where it is condensed into water. Additional water enters condenser 114 from<br>
make-up tank 112.<br>
[0022] The water from condenser 114 flows through condensate pump 124 into the<br>
low pressure feedwater heater 116. Extraction steam from the low pressure turbine<br><br>
108 is also fed into heater 116. The heated water from low pressure feedwater heater<br>
116 is fed into intermediate pressure feedwater heater 118 which also receives<br>
extraction steam from intermediate pressure turbine 106. The heated water from<br>
intermediate pressure feedwater heater 118 is fed to de-aerator feedwater heater 120<br>
which also receives water from high pressure turbine 104. The heated water from de-<br>
aerator feedwater heater 120 flows through a boiler feed pump 126 into high pressure<br>
feedwater heater 122. The heater 122 also receives water from high pressure turbine<br>
104. The heated water from heater 122 flows to steam generator 102.<br>
[0023] The present invention uses a steady state predictive model of the<br>
water/steam side of process 100 to detect tube leaks in the process. There are<br>
numerous methods to build such a model for a well-behaved system such as process<br>
100. Several of these methods are:<br>
1.	First principles models - these can work well, but are expensive to build,<br>
and time consuming to calibrate to existing wear and tear conditions. Also, they tend to<br>
be intolerant of sensor drift or sensor failures.<br>
2.	Neural network empirical models - these models are an improvement to<br>
the first principles models because they automatically factor in current wear and tear<br>
conditions. However, they are very time consuming to build, and are not tolerant of<br>
subsequent sensor drifts, failures, or input sets completely outside of the training range.<br>
3.	Advanced Pattern Recognition empirical models also automatically factor<br>
in current wear and tear conditions. They have the added advantages of being quick<br>
and easy to build and are very tolerant of multiple sensor failures or drifting.<br>
[0024] The Advanced Pattern Recognition (APR) technology, as is described below,<br>
was used in one embodiment of the present invention to construct a model of process<br>
100. It should be appreciated that other techniques, including but not limited to the<br>
other methods described above, can also be used to construct models for use with the<br>
present invention. As is described in more detail below in connection with Fig. 2, after<br>
the APR model is constructed it is deployed in real time. One example of a software<br>
product that can be used to generate the APR model is the Optimize17 On-Target<br>
software available from the assignee of the present invention as of the earliest claimed<br>
filing date for this application.<br><br>
[0025] The APR model can employ between about 50 and about 100 measured<br>
parameters of process 100. The exact number of measured process parameters used<br>
in a particular APR model is a function of the plant (e.g. the number of feedwater<br>
heaters and the number of turbine extraction points) and the instrumentation that is<br>
available in the plant. If some of the process parameters are not available, the model<br>
fidelity will suffer slightly, but the present invention will still detect leaks although either<br>
detection of very small leaks may not be possible or there may be occurrences of not<br>
true indications that the technique has detected a leak, that is, "false alarms" may<br>
occur.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown the real time deployment of the APR<br>
model 200 of process 100. The inputs to the APR model 200 are those of the about 50<br>
to about 100 measured parameters three of which are identified in Fig. 2 as "MU Flow"<br>
202, "FW Flow" 204 and "Cond Flow" 206 and the remainder of which are identified in<br>
Fig. 2 as "Other Sensors" 208. By reading in the current value of the parameters 202,<br>
204, 206 and 208, the APR model 200 generates expected (or model predicted) values<br>
for each of these input parameters.<br>
10027] The expected value for each of the parameters 202, 204, 206, 208 is<br>
compared to the actual measured value and the difference between the two values,<br>
known as the "DELTA", is determined. For ease of illustration, Fig. 2 shows only the<br>
calculation 210 of the DELTA between the expected value and the actual measured<br>
value for the MU Flow 202 parameter. When the DELTA has a positive value, the<br>
actual measured value is greater than the expected value.<br>
[0028] As is shown in Fig. 2 by block 212, statistical process control (SPC) methods<br>
can be applied to separate "normal" from "unusual" behavior for either a single point or<br>
groups of points. For ease of illustration, Fig. 2 shows only the SPC block 212<br>
associated with the DELTA between the expected value and the actual measured value<br>
for the MU Flow 202 parameter. In the case of boiler tube leaks, it can be postulated<br>
that the DELTA for Makeup flow 202, Condensate flow 204 and Feed water flow 206<br>
should become "unusual" shortly after a large leak occurs. Therefore SPC tools are<br>
applied to calculate standard deviations and test for exceeding the configured statistical<br>
limit.<br><br><br>
[0029] The use of SPC methods in combination with the APR empirical model will<br>
under most system operating conditions alert the plant operator to the occurrence of a<br>
tube leak. Most units cycle load, at least on a daily basis, and perhaps more often and<br>
thus during load and other transients (e.g. coal pulverizer trip), it is possible that the<br>
DELTA values may become large enough to trigger a statistical limit. However, a<br>
persistence time factor can be added to the limit so that the alarm will not trigger until<br>
the DELTA values are statistically large in the positive direction continuously for a<br>
configurable period of time. This eliminates the transient effects.<br>
[0030] As described above, the testing for statistical limits will alert the plant<br>
operator to the occurrence of larger leaks, but most leaks start out small and grow over<br>
time. In order to identify smaller leaks, the technique of the present invention can apply<br>
SPC data pattern testing as shown by block 214 of Fig. 2 to the DELTA values. For<br>
ease of illustration, Fig. 2 shows only the block 214 for the SPC data pattern testing of<br>
the DELTA between the expected value and the actual measured value for the MU<br>
Flow 202 parameter. The DELTA values can be tested for data patterns according to<br>
industry-accepted patterns, which may be the well known and accepted standard tests<br>
first developed by Western Electric, and/or patterns specifically created for use with the<br>
present invention or any combination of the industry standard and specially created<br>
patterns. The patterns are stored in block 214.<br>
[0031] While there are many generally accepted pattern tests, of interest is one of<br>
"n" points in a row or "n" out of "m" points with a positive value. The values of "n" and<br>
"m" are established based upon the overall persistence time described above and the<br>
frequency of performing calculations in general. Another pattern test can be<br>
implemented for a sustained increasing trend (e.g. 5 out of 6 points in a row increasing)<br>
on the DELTA values.<br>
[0032] Another parameter of great interest in determining the existence of a tube<br>
leak is the goodness of fit of the APR model 200 as a whole. All of the about 50 to<br>
about 100 Delta values are used by the APR Model 200 in calculating a "Model Fit"<br>
parameter which ranges between 0.0000 and 1.0000. The technique used by the APR<br>
Model 200 to calculate the Model Fit parameter is determined by the vendor of the<br>
software used to make the APR model 200. A model fit parameter of 1.0000<br><br><br>
represents a perfect model, that is, all of the about 50 to about 100 prediction outputs<br>
exactly match their corresponding input values and all Deltas equal 0.00000. A model<br>
fit parameter of 0.0000 represents a model so imperfect that no individual output is<br>
statistically close to the actual measured parameter. In practice, a good model fit<br>
parameter is one that has a value of about 0.97 most of the time.<br>
[0033] When a tube leak (or other significant plant anomaly) occurs, the fit of the<br>
model as a whole degrades because many measured parameters are influenced.<br>
Some, such as the three flow signals, MU Flow 202, FW Flow 204 and Cond. Flow 206,<br>
will vary to a large degree and others such as FW pressure, opacity, NOx etc. will vary<br>
to a lesser degree. This degradation will cause the overall model fit parameter to<br>
degrade to values such as 0.94 or less in a very short period of time. Again statistical<br>
tests can be applied to the model fit parameter and the results of the statistical tests<br>
can be used in the malfunction rule set described below.<br>
[0034] Of special interest are the Deltas for MU (Makeup) flow 202, total feedwater<br>
flow 204, and condensate flow 206 parameters. If a boiler tube leak is present, one<br>
skilled in the art would expect the actual value of each of these three parameters to be<br>
greater than their respective model predicted values. Thus the method of the present<br>
invention compares each of these three Deltas to their respective three sigma limits to<br>
determine if the deviation is both positive and statistically large. For ease of illustration,<br>
Fig. 2 shows only the comparison 224 of the Delta for the MU Flow 202 parameter. If<br>
any two of the three parameters 202, 204, 206 are beyond these statistically large limits<br>
for a period of time which is sufficient to remove transient measurement effects, then<br>
that is indicative of a large boiler leak. The particular period of time is specific to the<br>
power generation unit and depends on several factors including the steam generator,<br>
the instrumentation and where the instrumentation is mounted. During commissioning<br>
of the present invention, the time period is adjusted until the number of false or<br>
nuisance alarms due to load transients and other plant disturbances are considered by<br>
the plant operating personnel to be tolerable.<br>
[0035] Again, if two of the three Deltas for the parameters 202, 204, 206 exhibit<br>
sustained periods of time where Delta values are slightly positive, that is, the actual<br>
value is greater than the predicted value, a smaller leak is probable. Finally, if one of<br><br><br>
the Deltas for the parameters 202, 204, 206 matches one of the patterns and the model<br>
fit parameter is less than a predetermined value for a predetermined period of time, this<br>
is indicative that a leak may be present.<br>
[0036] All of the above tests are embodied in a leak detection rule set 220 within the<br>
software, and the rule set causes appropriate alarms or messages to be sent if true.<br>
[0037] While development of such a rule is well within the capability of those of<br>
ordinary of the art, one example of such a tube leak rule is:<br>
If for t minutes, the Model Fit Delta is greater than a and either:<br>
the MU Flow Delta is greater than +b and the FW Flow Delta is greater than +c;<br>
or<br>
the MU Flow Delta is greater than +b and the Cond Flow Delta is greater than<br>
+d; or<br>
the FW Flow Delta is greater than +c and the Cond Flow Delta is greater than<br>
+d;<br>
Then a large boiler tube leak is probable,<br>
where a, b, c, and d are fuzzy ranges for the associated parameters. The use of fuzzy<br>
ranges is a common method for the instantiation of If - Then style rules. The specific<br>
fuzzy range in engineering units, for example, Ibs/hr, for each parameter a, b, c, and d<br>
will be different for each continuous process. Since the values for a, b, c, and d are<br>
fuzzy ranges, the result of each rule is a probability or certainty that the outcome is true.<br>
For example, the output of the present invention might be that it is 68% certain that a<br>
large boiler tube leak exists while simultaneously another rule might have an output that<br>
it is 95% certain that a small boiler tube leak exists.<br>
[0038] Similarly, other well understood faults can be identified by using the<br>
technique of the present invention, that is, using the same APR process model 200, but<br>
with different measured parameters and DELTAs of interest. One example of these<br>
other faults are tube leaks inside feedwater heaters which can be detected using heater<br>
drain, heater inlet, and heater outlet temperatures with a feedwater heater tube leak<br>
rule set 222. Another example of these other faults are steam entering the drain cooler<br>
of a feedwater heater which can be detected using the same three parameters, that is,<br><br><br>
heater drain, heater inlet and heater outlet temperatures, and a rule set that is different<br>
than the feedwater heater tube leak rule set 222.<br>
[0039] There may be occurrences in process 100 for which no rule sets have yet<br>
been written. Timer 216 and Delta 218, shown in Fig. 2, are used to alarm those<br>
occurrences.<br>
[0040] The present invention is not limited to the steam generation process. It can<br>
be applied to other well-understood faults in other continuous processes. For example,<br>
excessive seal wear in gas compressors that will ultimately lead to compressor failure<br>
can be detected from an APR model of that process and a seal wear rule set.<br>
[0041] The first step in building the empirical model 200 of process 100 is to<br>
assemble normal operational data from a plant historian for about 100 transmitters<br>
covering about 30 days of operation. These days can be selected to give the model<br>
200 as wide a spectrum of normal operations as practical, e.g. different loads, different<br>
ambient conditions, different numbers of auxiliaries in operation, etc. Since the model<br>
200 is a steady state model, the data need not be in clock/calendar sequence. The<br>
data collection frequency can be anywhere from every 5 minutes to every 15 minutes.<br>
At the same time, a second set of historical data covering the same data tags should be<br>
assembled from different calendar dates to validate the model 200 after it is<br>
constructed.<br>
[0042] The APR model generation software used in the embodiment described<br>
herein is the Optimize17 On-Target software. That software connects to any brand of<br>
distributed control system (DCS) or historian, and includes tools to review the raw data<br>
and quickly discard any records with missing data or obvious outliers. Caution should<br>
be taken to retain records covering normal excursions and operational modes (e.g. HP<br>
FW Heater out of service) while eliminating records covering unusual excursions (e.g.<br>
load runback due to trip of the forced draft fan). Usually data below 30% unit load is<br>
ignored.<br>
[0043] The second step is to eliminate duplicate (or very similar) records. Again,<br>
the APR model generation software should, as does the APR model generation<br>
software used in this embodiment, contain tools to simplify removal of such records. In<br><br><br>
this manner, thousands of data records can be reduced to less than 500 records in a<br>
matter of seconds.<br>
[0044] The third step is to construct the model 200 from the training set, that is, the<br>
assembled normal operational data. The nature of Advanced Pattern Recognition<br>
technology allows a current generation PC to accomplish this task in less than 30<br>
seconds which is far less time by many orders of magnitude than any other technology<br>
such as, for example, neural networks or multiple non-linear regression.<br>
[0045] The fourth step is to validate the model 200 by using the model to predict<br>
values for a second or validation data set collected during the first step. For the<br>
embodiment described herein, the validation data set is actual plant data that contains<br>
about three weeks of data and includes a known boiler tube leak occurrence that began<br>
some time during the three weeks of data in the records,<br>
[0046] As can be seen in Figure 3, there is good agreement between predicted<br>
values 400 and actual data 402 for MW Load in a selected 2.5-day period out of the<br>
three weeks. The same is true for all other days and most other parameters in the<br>
model.<br>
[0047] However, in the case of Makeup Flow for the same 2.5-day period of time<br>
(Figure 4), at the cursor position (record number 994) the actual value 404 begins to<br>
exceed the prediction 406 continuously.<br>
[0048] To visualize the impact of this situation better, the DELTAS for any variable<br>
can be accumulated over the entire three week period. For most parameters, the<br>
cumulative difference will hover near zero. As is shown in Fig. 5, this is only true for<br>
both Makeup flow (trace 408) and feedwater flow (trace 410) until record 994. Then the<br>
actual values for both of those parameters continuously exceed the predictions which is<br>
indicative of a boiler tube leak. The slopes of the lines are somewhat proportional to<br>
the size of the leak.<br>
[0049] To implement the Statistical Process Control aspects of the present<br>
invention, the commercial off the shelf Advise Optimax Performance software package<br>
available from the assignee of the present invention as of the earliest claimed filing date<br>
of this patent application was selected, primarily for its tight integration with the On-<br>
Target Advanced Pattern Recognition software. Alarm limits with appropriate<br><br><br>
persistence levels are selected for the Makeup Flow, Feedwater flow and Condensate<br>
Flow DELTAS to detect the large leaks. The data pattern tests described earlier are<br>
activated for the same variables. The Optimax Performance software also includes the<br>
tools to implement the rules governing the triggers for leak detection.<br>
[0050] The present invention may, as is shown in Fig. 6, be implemented in the form<br>
of a software program that runs on a computing device 300 that is connected to a<br>
process, which may for example be the process 100 of Fig. 1, by a data highway 302<br>
and a distributed control system (DCS) 304. The data highway 302 has the capacity to<br>
interface with the sensors at measurement locations 1 to 24 of Fig. 1. The computing<br>
device 300, may for example, be any suitably arranged device such as a desktop PC<br>
that is capable of executing the program. The program may be a series of instructions<br>
on a suitable media such as a CD-ROM and computing device 300 has a suitable<br>
device such as the well known CDRW drive for receiving the CD-ROM so that the<br>
program can be read from the CD-ROM and loaded into device 300 for execution and if<br>
desired stored in a storage media such as a hard drive which is part of device 300.<br>
[0051] The present invention has been shown and described with reference to the<br>
