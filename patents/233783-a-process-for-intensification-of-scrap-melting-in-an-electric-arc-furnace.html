				<td>The present invention relates to the process for intensification of scrap melting in an<br>
Electric Arc Furnace.<br>
In the presently known art of scrap melting in electric arc furnace the available cost<br>
effective scrap mix alongwith non-metallic charges like lime and iron ore is charged in a<br>
refractory lined EAF or in an EAF with provision of water cooled panels. The roof, after<br>
charging, is swung back in arcing position and arc is struck initially at low voltage and<br>
gradually increasing the voltage to maximum. Electrodes gradually bore down into the<br>
charge. Second and even third charge is made depending on scrap quality and capacity<br>
of the furnace whenever partial melting of the scrap makes room for subsequent<br>
charge. During melting, metal pool is formed just under electrodes and with passing of<br>
time standing scrap- column slowly collapses. Towards the end of melting (when 70-80%<br>
of scrap is molten) voltage is reduced so that long arc is avoided. After attaining all melt<br>
(about 1550-60°C bath temperature), the bath is completely flat and covered with slag.<br>
At this stage, metal sample and temperature is taken. The temperature is then raised to<br>
about 1600°C and refining process follows thereafter. During refining, since, only<br>
temperature of the bath needs to be maintained by arcing the voltage is reduced to<br>
minimum and flaring of arc becomes insignificant.<br>
Thus under the known art discussed above the electric arc furnace is charged with<br>
scrap, sponge iron, non-metallic fluxes like lime, iron ore etc. For one heat, in general,<br>
two bucket charging practice is employed as the density of scrap is low.<br>
After about 70% melting is over the electric arcs which were covered with scrap become<br>
exposed. The radiation emanating from the arcs lead to loss of energy and badly affects<br>
the furnace lining. The heat transfer to metal bath is also reduced. Traditionally, this<br><br>
phenomenon is minimized by reducing the arc voltage and thereby the arc length. Even<br>
then there is significant loss of energy.<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide a process for scrap<br>
melting in electric arc furnace to produce molten metal which would avoid the loss of<br>
expensive energy due to exposure of the electric arc as experienced in the known art<br>
and also improve heat transfer to the bath during arcing.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is directed to provide a process for scrap<br>
melting in electric arc furnace which would consume less power as compared to<br>
conventional processes and thereby provide for a more economical scrap melting in<br>
electric arc furnaces.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for scrap melting<br>
in electric arc furnace which would save melting time and hence will be cost effective.<br>
Yet further objective of the present invention is directed to provide a process for scrap<br>
melting in electric arc furnace which would not damage the side wall linings of the<br>
furnace and would thereby provide for increased life of the furnace wall lining.<br>
Yet further objective of the invention is directed to provide a process of scrap melting in<br>
electric arc furnace which would provide for engulfing the arc by slag and thereby also<br>
prevent pick-up of nitrogen by steel from the ionised atmosphere in the vicinity of the<br>
arcs.<br><br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for producing<br>
molten metal from scrap metal in an Electric Arc Furnace comprising :<br>
providing the scrap metal in the Electric Arc Furnace ;<br>
subjecting the scrap metal to heating by electrical arcing ; and<br>
shielding the electrical arc by slag cover during the melting process ; followed by<br>
refining of the melt following conventional techniques.<br>
In particular, in the process of the invention the step of shielding of the electrical arc<br>
comprise :<br>
constantly monitoring the slag level in said furnace and ensure the the electric arcs<br>
generated are covered by said slag ; and<br>
injecting coke breeze with air as carrier gas with or without oxygen blowing when about<br>
70-80% of the scrap has melted with continued run of the furnace at maximum voltage<br>
thereby generate CO gas bubbles to swell up the slag for continued shielding of the<br>
electric arc during the melting process.<br>
The process of the invention is thus distinguished from the known art of scrap melting in<br>
electric arc furnaces in that the same provides for a slag cover for the arc even towards<br>
the end of melting in an electric arc furnace when about 70-80% of scrap has melted to<br>
thereby save substantial amount of energy loss.<br>
In particular, the process reduces power consumption in electric arc furnaces through<br>
generation of increased volume of slag even when 70-80% of slag is melted by<br><br>
developing a sustainable gas-slag emulsion. The swelled slag so generated is capable<br>
of protecting the arc from radiating out. The process developed involves injection of<br>
coke at the slag-metal interface at a controlled rate with or without simultaneous oxygen<br>
lancing depending on slag fluidity. This generates carbon monoxide gas at controlled<br>
rate by C-O reaction or C-FeO (slag) reaction under a slag condition conducive for<br>
entrapping the CO gas bubble resulting in foaming slag sufficient to cover the arc<br>
underneath. Parameters like point of coke injection, time of injection start, injection rate,<br>
number of injection stages, need for oxygen lancing, and conducive slag characteristics<br>
for sustained bubble formation were established for long and stable foaming slag<br>
capable of covering the arc leading to reduction in power consumption.<br>
Importantly, therefore the process of scrap melting of this invention provides for cover of<br>
the arc radiation during melting period by generating, a swelled up slag cover to engulf<br>
the arcs completely. Such step of generation of swelled up slag cover is directed to<br>
achieve the following advantages<br>
i) shielding of the arcs to improve heat transfer to bath for saving in power<br>
consumption<br>
ii) saving in melting time<br>
iii) protection of side wall lining,<br>
iv) prevent pick up of nitrogen by steel from the ionised atmosphere in the vicinity of<br>
the arcs.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the process of the invention, the step of<br>
shielding the electric arc comprise<br>
a first stage injection of coke breeze with air as carrier gas when 70-80% scrap has<br>
melted with or without simultaneous blowing of oxygen in the bath ;<br><br>
continuing the arcing at 1550 - 1560°C metal temperature upto melt down under<br>
constant monitoring of the melt sample and temperature ;<br>
a second stage injection of coke which is continued until the bath temperature of<br>
1600°C is reached to thereby ensure engulfing of the arc by slag during the melting<br>
process.<br>
The most preferred operating conditions for achieving proper shielding of the electric arc<br>
following the process of the invention are identified as follows :<br>
Coke Size :	is less than 3 mm<br>
Carrier gas	= Compressed air<br>
No. of phases of injection	= 2<br>
In the process of this invention raw materials and equipment include :<br>
a)	Dry coke breeze of less than 3 mm size.<br>
b)	Utilization of oxygen blowing facility (regularly used for decarburisation during<br>
refining period), if required.<br>
c)	Dispenser unit for injecting coke with air as carrier gas.<br>
Preferably, the steps of shielding the arc in the process of the invention comprise :<br>
start of injection of coke breeze (about 3 kg/t, 15-25 kg/min, less than less than 3<br>
mm size) with air as carrier gas when 70-80% scrap has melted and a slag-metal<br>
pool is available to introduce the injection lance at slag/metal interface with the<br>
furnace continued to run at maximum voltage throughout;<br>
simultaneous blowing of oxygen in the bath only if slag is found to be viscous<br>
wherebv the carbon of coke reacts with oxygen of slag FeO or directly blown<br><br>
oxygen to form CO gas bubbles which are entrapped in viscous slag and provide<br>
for swelling up of the slag.<br>
continuing arcing in that temperature range of 1550-1560°C upto melt down and<br>
taking all melt sample and temperature in the process ;<br>
second stage injection of coke of about 3 kg/t, similar to first stage injection,<br>
which is continued till bath temperature of upto about 1600°C is reached and<br>
finally, subjecting the melt to refining as per conventional techniques.<br>
In the above process of the invention oxygen is required for generation of CO gas by<br>
carbon-oxygen reaction. If the initial slag has a high FeO content (in excess of 18%),<br>
the slag, inspite of being highly fluid, provides enough oxygen, as FeO for. CO<br>
generation. CO gas generated by reaction of injected oxygen and carbon escapes<br>
through high FeO fluid slag. On the other hand, if FeO is utilized as a source of oxygen<br>
for generation of CO gas, the slag fluidity decreases due to the lowering of FeO content<br>
and also the slag temperature (reaction of C with FeO is endothermic). This provides for<br>
the swelling up of the slag. Alternately, simultaneous oxygen injection may be used<br>
when initial slag FeO is less than 18% and the slag is not sufficiently fluid. This depends<br>
on visual judgement of slag fluidity. Thus following the process of the invention an initial<br>
slag with high FeO content (&gt;18%) arising from usual charge mix may be made foamy<br>
simply by coke injection and without supplementary gaseous oxygen. With visual<br>
judgement of slag viscosity, supplementary oxygen may be used occasionally.<br><br>
The details of the invention, its objectives and advantages are explained hereunder in<br>
greater detail with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of a conventional<br>
process of metal scrap melting and the process of this invention in relation to<br>
accompanying figure 1.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
For the purpose identical batches of scrap were melted in EAF following conventional<br>
technique and that following the process of the present invention. The conventional<br>
process of scrap melting followed is detailed under Example 1 while the process of<br>
scrap melting in accordance with the present invention is detailed under Example 2<br>
hereunder.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (Conventional Process):<br>
i) Charging the EAF with<br>
a)	Scrap : 106kg/100 kg liquid steel output in two batches.<br>
(Scrap may be partially replaced by Sponge Iron)<br>
b)	Iron Ore : 20 kg/t, Lime : 30 kg/t<br>
ii) Melting the charge in (i) above with highest voltage.<br>
iii) Reducing the voltage after about 80% completion of melting.<br>
vi) Melting down further at about 1550°C and<br>
v) Continuing heating further to reach 1600°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (Process of the invention):<br>
i) Charging the EAF with<br>
a)	Scrap : 106 kg/100 kg. Liquid steel output in two batches.<br>
(Scrap may be partially replaced by Sponge Iron)<br>
b)	Iron ore : 20 kg/t, Lime : 30 kg/t<br>
ii) Melting the charge in (i) above with highest voltage.<br>
iii) After about 70% melting introducing coke injection lance at slag/metal interface<br>
carrying out first stage coke injection by injecting 3 kg/t coke breeze of less than 3 mm size.<br><br>
vi) Continuing melting with highest voltage operation.<br>
v) Melting down further at about 1550°C<br>
vi) Carrying out second stage coke injection by Injecting coke 3 kg/t of less than 3 mm<br>
size until attainment of 1600°C when the injection is ended.<br>
Initial slag characteristics were found to be identical in both conventional process and<br>
the process of invention as the charge materials including slag forming non-metallics<br>
remained unchanged. Nominal slag characteristics in both the cases were identified as<br>
follows :<br>
Basicity = 1.4-2.5<br>
FeO = 12 - 30%<br>
The energy consumed in the respective processes under Examples 1 and 2 were also<br>
monitored and detailed hereunder:<br><br>
These values are based on a 60t heat size.<br>
The above TABLE 1 clearly demonstrate the achievement of lower power consumption<br>
following the process of scrap melting in EAF in accordance with the present invention<br>
vis-a-vis the conventional process of scrap melting in EAF. Importantly, the reduction in<br>
power consumption is by about 7% in Electric Arc Furnace following the process of this<br>
invention.<br>
The process of this invention therefore provides for the following advantages :<br>
i) Use of slag FeO as a source of oxygen for in situ generation of controlled carbon<br>
monoxide gas bubble through controlled injection of coke in order to swell the<br><br>
ii) Establishes proper time of coke injection and two stage coke injection under<br>
plant condition to derive maximum benefit of sustainable arc engulfing foaming<br>
slag.<br>
iii) Establishes slag characteristics under plant operating condition in order to<br>
generate controlled amount of sustainable foaming slag vis-a-vis controlled<br>
carbon monoxide gas generation.<br>
iv) Two stage coke injection to generate foaming slag twice has the added<br>
advantage of using the intervening time for necessary metal sample collection<br>
avoiding delay in operation.<br>
The process of the invention will therefore provide for power saving of about 7-8% and<br>
will be useful for EAF industries for saving electrical energy and therefore render the<br>
process of scrap melting in EAF more economical and cost effective.<br><br>
