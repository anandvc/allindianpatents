SPECIFICATION SEASONING<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a flavor improving agent for a food or drink and a seasoning.<br>
Background Art<br>
Basic tastes are the most basic elements that represent the quality of taste and, at present, physiologically mean five tastes, that is, sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and umami   (Maruzen Shokuhin Sogo Jiten, Maruzen)·<br>
In addition to basic tastes, there is body taste(in Japanese, "ico;cujni"). Body taste means umami  with continuity, preferably having thickness and mouthfullness imparted thereto.<br>
Although umami seasonings and natural seasonings such as yeast extract, protein hydrolyzate, fish and shell extract and meat extract can impart umami and other basic tastes, they can hardly impart sufficient body taste.<br>
For imparting "body"  to a food or drink, the known methods include those comprising addition of pyrazine compounds (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 313635/99), glutathione [Biosci. Biotech. Biochem, ^, 1977-1980 (1997)], sulfone group-containing compounds, phosphates and betaine (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 289761/96), an enzymatic hydrolysate of gelatin and tropomyosin (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 228715/96) and an 0/W emulsified composition (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 179026/98), respectively.<br>
Thus, development of a method for imparting body taste to a food or drink is desired.<br>
Salt is a flavoring substance having saltiness which<br><br>
is one of the basic tastes · In addition to having an action to improve the quality of taste, salt has an effect on improving storage stability and processability of foods, such as improvement of storage stability due to osmotic pressure and improvement of binding ability of fish and meat paste products and flour products, and is used in many foods. In salt-containing foods, processes have conventionally been carried out to reduce saltiness and provide milder taste, that is, to milden a salty taste.<br>
The known methods for mildening a salty taste include those comprising addition of an amino acid or lactic acid [Chomiryo and Koshinryo-no-Jiten (Dictionary of Seasonings and Spices), pp.234, Asakura Shoten], glycyrrhizin [Chomiryo and Koshinryo-no-Jiten (Dictionary of Seasonings and Spices), pp.137, Asakura Shoten] and sucralose (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 205814/96), respectively.<br>
Thus, development of a method for mildening a salty taste is desired.<br>
On the other hand, it has been known that emulsifiability, foamability, resistance to protease digestion and divalent metal ion-binding ability are improved by subjecting egg yolk protein to amino-carbonyl reaction with enzymatic decomposate of galactomannan (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 277056/94).<br>

Although peptides having a molecular weight of 1000-5000 can be obtained by peptide synthesis^ they are usually obtained by hydrolyzing a protein with an acid or protein hydrolase and preferably treating the resulting hydrolyzate with an ultra-filtration membrane or by gel filtration to collect a fraction having a molecular weight of 1000-5000.<br>
As proteins, any proteins such as plant proteins, animal proteins arid proteins derived from yeast cells may be used.<br>
Examples of plant proteins are seed-proteins such as soybean protein, wheat protein and maize protein.<br>
Examples of animal proteins are lactoproteins such as whey protein and casein, egg proteins such as egg white protein and egg yolk protein, blood proteins such as plasma protein and blood cell protein, and muscle proteins such as meat protein and fish protein.<br>
As yeast cell-derived proteins, yeasts such as brewing yeast and baker's yeast may be used as they are, or after isolation and purification of the protein contained in the cell.<br>
Proteins obtained by applying a chemical treatment, an enzymatic treatment or a physical treatment to the above-described proteins, for example, gelatin, plakalbumin, metaprotein, proteose and peptone may also be<br><br>
used.<br>
Gelatin has two types, one is obtained by acid treatment (type A) and the other by alkali treatment (type B), and both types may be used·<br>
In the present invention, suitable proteins are soybean protein, wheat protein, whey protein, casein, plasma protein, egg white protein, gelatin and yeast cell-derived proteins.<br>
The protein hydrolase includes endopeptidase (also called proteinase) and exopeptidase, and endopeptidase is preferably used.<br>

As acid, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and organic acids such as citric acid are used.<br>
As protein hydrolase, endopeptidase having exopeptidase activity is preferably used because, sometimes, umami  derived from free amino acid and low molecular weight peptides is produced and bitter taste also caused by them is reduced by the action of exopeptidase.<br>
Examples of endopeptidase having exopeptidase activity are Umamizyme (Amano Enzyme) and Actinase (Kaken Pharmaceutical). In using endopeptidase having a low exopeptidase activity, exopeptidase may be separately added.<br>
The amount of protein hydrolase used is not limited as it depends on the kinds of the enzyme and protein to be used, but is preferably 0.05-10% (w/w), more preferably<br><br>
0.1-7% (w/w) and particularly preferably 1-5% (w/w) of the protein to be hydrolyzed.<br>
As to the pH and the reaction temperature for the hydrolysis of proteins, the optimum conditions for the enzyme used or conditions similar thereto may be properly selected.<br>
The pH can be adjusted by adding acids that are acceptable for a food or drink, such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, citric acid and phosphoric acid, and alkalis that are acceptable for a food or drink, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide.<br>
The time of protein hydrolysis varies depending upon the kinds of protein hydrolase used, its amount and temperature and pH conditions. Usually, the time of hydrolysis is preferably.1-100 hours and more preferably 6-72 hours.<br>
After the completion of hydrolysis, the reaction mixture can be directly subjected to the subsequent treatment as it is. It is also possible to inactivate the enzyme by heating or acid treatment before subjecting the reaction mixture to the subsequent treatment.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Example 1<br>
Isolated soy protein (Fuji Oil) (50 g) was dispersed in 450 ml of water, to which 1 ml of Alkalase 2.4L (Novozymes, 2-4 AU/g, the same applies hereinafter) was added, and the mixture was allowed to react at 5O°C for 30 minutes without adjusting the pH. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 8 with 6 mol/1 sodium hydroxide and allowed to react at 5O°C for 20 hours while maintaining the mixture at pH 8. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 6 mol/1 hydrochloric acid and heated at 85-9O*=^C for 20 minutes to inactivate the enzyme, followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was filtered to obtain a transparent soy protein decomposition solution. The decomposition solution was subjected to separation using an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular-weight cutoff of 1000-5000 to obtain a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000-5000- The fraction was freeze-dried to obtain a powder.<br>
The powder (2 g) thus obtained was dissolved in 50 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.04 g of xylose (Wako Pure Chemical), and reaction was carried out at 9O^C for 4 hours. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was dialyzed using a dialysis membrane with a fractional molecular-weight cutoff of 1000 to obtain about 2 g of a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more. By repeating this operation for 6 times, about 10 g of a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more was obtained.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
About 10 g of a fraction containing substance having<br><br>
a molecular weight of 1000 or more was obtained by a method similar to that of Example 1 except that xylose (0.04 g) was not used.<br>
Example 2<br>
Gelatin (Type B)(Sigma-Aldrich, the same applies hereinafter) (50 g) was dispersed in 450 ml of water^ to which 1 ml of Alkalase (Novozymes) was added^ and the mixture was allowed to react at 5O°C for 3 0 minutes without adjusting the pH. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 8 with 6 mol/1 sodium hydroxide and allowed to react at 5O°C for 20 hours while maintaining the mixture at pH 8. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 6 mol/1 hydrochloric acid and heated at 85-9Oºc for 20 minutes to inactivate the enzyme, followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was filtered to obtain a transparent gelatin (type B) decomposition solution. The decomposition solution was subjected to separation using an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular-weight cutoff of 1000-5000 to obtain a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000-5000· The fraction was freeze-dried to obtain a powder.<br>
The powder (2 g) thus obtained was dissolved in 50 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.04 g of ribose (Wako Pure Chemical), and reaction was carried out at 9O*^C for 4 hours. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was dialyzed using a dialysis membrane with a fractional molecular-weight cutoff of 1000 to obtain about 2 g of a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more. By repeating this operation for 6 times, about 10 g of a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more was obtained.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br><br>
About 10 g of a fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more was obtained according to a method similar to that of Example 2 except that ribose (0.04 g) was not used-<br>
Example 3<br>
A mix type consomme soup containing 1.5% (w/v) consomme soup was prepared by adding hot water to 15 g of a consomme soup premix comprising 50% (w/w) salt, 7%(w/w) white superior soft sugar, 3% (w/w) onion extract powder (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, the same applies hereinafter), 1.5% (w/w) sodium glutamate (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, the same applies hereinafter) and 38.5% (w/w) lactose to bring the total volume to 1 liter. To the consommŠ soup thus prepared, the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 1 or the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Comparative Example 1 was added at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) to prepare a consommŠ soup. A sensory test with respect to flavor was conducted for each soup at a tasting temperature of 50-6O°C using a method of rating on five levels.  The test was conducted by a panel consisting of well-trained 15 members.<br>
The results obtained by averaging the evaluations of the panel are shown in Table 1.<br>
In the table, the results of evaluation are indicated according to the following criteria (the same applied to the following examples).<br>
That is, that flavor was not tasted was indicated by "-", slightly tasted was indicated by "±",   somewhat tasted by "+", tasted by "++" and appreciably tasted by "+++". Furthermore, as a result of averaging the evaluations of the panel, if the result was, for example, between "+" and "++", it was indicated by "+±".<br><br>
Table 1<br><br>
As shown in Table 1, body taste of the consomm¿ soup was enhanced by the addition of the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 1, that is, the amino-carbonyl reacted peptide.<br>
Example 4<br>
A mix type consomme soup containing 1.5% (w/v) consomme soup was prepared by adding hot water to 15 g of a consomme soup premix comprising 50% (w/w) salt, 7%(w/w) white superior soft sugar, 3% (w/w) onion extract powder, 1.5% (w/w) sodium glutamate and 38.5% (w/w) lactose to bring the total volume to 1 liter. To the consomme soup thus prepared, the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 2 or the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Comparative Example 2 was added at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) to prepare a consomme soup- A sensory test with respect to flavor was conducted for each soup at a tasting temperature of 50-<br><br>
6O*=^C. The test was conducted by a panel consisting of well-trained 15 members.<br>
The results obtained by averaging the evaluations of the panel are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
As shown in Table 2,   body taste of the consomm6 soup was enhanced by the addition of the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 2,   that is, the amino-carbonyl reacted peptide.<br>
Example 5<br>
A mix type consommŠ soup (1) containing l.5%(w/v) consommŠ soup was prepared by adding hot water to 15 g of a consommŠ soup premix comprising 50% (w/w) salt, 7%(w/w) white superior soft sugar, 3% (w/w) onion extract powder, 1.5% (w/w) sodium glutamate and 38.5% (w/w) lactose to bring the total volume to 1 liter. Consomme soup (2) was prepared by adding the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 3, body taste enhancing action of the amino-carbonyl reacted peptide is intensified by combination with pyrazine compounds.<br>
Example 6<br>
A saline solution containing 0.6% (w/v) salt was prepared- To the saline solution, the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 1 was added at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) to prepare another saline solution. A sensory test with respect to flavor was conducted for the saline solutions thus prepared at a tasting temperature of 50-6O^C.    The test was conducted by a panel consisting of well-trained 15 members.<br>
The results obtained by averaging the evaluations of the panel are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
As shown in Table 4, taste of saltiness of the saline solution was weakened by the addition of the fraction containing substance having a molecular weight of 1000 or more obtained in Example 1, that is, the amino-carbonyl reacted peptide.<br>
