				<td>Description<br>
Method for insertion of a weft thread on a weaving loom, and a<br>
weaving loom<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for insertion of a weft<br>
thread on a weaving loom whereby an insertion parameter is determined.<br>
The invention also relates to a weaving loom for the application<br>
of such a method, in other words a weaving loom that applies a<br>
method as stated above.<br>
[0002] Weaving looms in which compressed air is supplied to a<br>
blower comprise one or more main blowers and a number of secondary<br>
blowers for insertion of a weft thread into a weaving shed. On<br>
such weaving looms where different types of weft threads are inserted<br>
into a weaving shed according to a pattern, a corresponding<br>
set of main blowers with a corresponding supply device for compressed<br>
air is provided for each of these weft threads. The compressed<br>
air is supplied, for example, by an appropriate control of<br>
shut-off valves installed between a reservoir with compressed air<br>
and corresponding main blowers and/or secondary blowers. The<br>
amount of compressed air supplied can be regulated here by means<br>
of a motor-controlled throttle valve installed between the reservoir<br>
and a corresponding main blower and/or secondary blower. Such a<br>
motor-controlled throttle valve comprises for example a controllable<br>
stepping motor that can be controlled in both directions with a desired<br>
number of steps by means of a control unit.<br>
[0003] The control of the amount of compressed air supplied during<br>
weaving as a function of a deviation from a measured insertion parameter<br>
is well known. It is possible here, for example, to control the<br>
amount of compressed air supplied in such a way that an inserted<br>
weft thread reaches the end of the weaving shed at a more or less<br><br>
desired angular position of the weaving loom. According to one possibility,<br>
a mean deviation is determined here between the moment at<br>
which the weft thread reaches the end of the weaving shed and the<br>
moment at which the mean drive sheft of the weaving loom reaches<br>
a given angular position. The throttle valve is then controlled, for example,<br>
in such a way that the mean deviation for insertions becomes<br>
more or less equal to a given value.<br>
[0004] It is also possible to control the rotational speed of the weaving<br>
loom during weaving as a function of a deviation from a measured<br>
insertion parameter. For example, as described in<br>
NL 7908357 A, to control this rotational speed in such a way that the<br>
time required to insert a weft thread into a weaving shed takes a<br>
more or less constant proportion of the actual time for a weaving cycle<br>
determined by the rotational speed of the weaving loom. A weaving<br>
cycle is determined i.a. by a given time necessary for one revolution<br>
of the weaving loom, in other words by the weaving speed of the<br>
weaving loom or the rotational speed of the weaving loom. One weft<br>
thread is normally inserted into a weaving shed during one revolution<br>
of the weaving loom.<br>
[0005] An object of the invention is a method and a weaving loom<br>
that permit a control parameter to be adapted in a controlled manner.<br>
[0006] This object is achieved by a method according to claim 1.<br>
more particularly a method according to the invention comprises on<br>
the one hand adapting at least one control parameter for an insertion<br>
according to an algorithm and, on the other hand, adapting at<br>
least control parameter for a weaving cycle according to an algorithm.<br>
Such an adaption can be performed as a function of one or<br>
more insertion parameters and/or of one or more control parameters<br>
for an insertion and/or of one or more control parameters for a weaving<br>
cycle.<br><br>
[0007] Through an appropriate choice or the appropriate selection of<br>
an algorithm or method for adaption of a control parameter for an<br>
insertion or of a control parameter for a weaving cycle, it is possible<br>
to increase the production of woven fabric without having a negative<br>
influence on the quality of the produced woven fabric and/or of the<br>
weaving efficiency of the weaving loom. This permits i.a. a controlled<br>
variation of the weaving loom rotational speed as a function of one<br>
or more measured insertion parameters, without the risk of the number<br>
of stoppages in weaving increasing significantly due to an incorrectly<br>
inserted weft thread. This also permits i.a. a selected control<br>
parameter to be regulated as a function of a mean deviation from<br>
one or more current or measured insertion parameters. The selection<br>
of a given algorithm according to a method according to the invention<br>
allows the above-mentioned advantages to be achieved and<br>
the control parameters to be advantageously adapted.<br>
[0008] According to an advantageous embodiment, the method<br>
comprises the input of one or more basic values for a control parameter<br>
and/or the input of one or more limit values for a control parameter.<br>
Such basic values and limit values can be used to selectively<br>
control either a control parameter for an insertion or a control<br>
parameter for a weaving cycle according to a given algorithm.<br>
[0009] The object of the invention is achieved by a weaving loom<br>
according to claim 12. More particularly a weaving loom according to<br>
the invention comprises a control device for a control parameter for<br>
an insertion, a control device for a control parameter for a weaving<br>
cycle and a selection device that controls the control device for the<br>
control parameter for an insertion or the control device for a control<br>
parameter for a weaving cycle. Such a selection device preferably<br>
operates together with an evaluating device for determining a representative<br>
value for one or more actual insertion parameters. This<br>
permits a control parameter to be regulated as a function of such a<br><br>
value. For example, a evaluating device for determining the difference<br>
in time between a measured moment when a weft thread arrives<br>
at a thread monitor and a reference moment in the weaving<br>
cycle and for determining a representative mean value for this difference<br>
in time. This permits i.a. a control parameter to be regulated<br>
as a function of a mean deviation from a current insertion parameter.<br>
[0010] Further characteristics and advantages of the invention can<br>
be found in the following description of the illustrative embodiment<br>
shown in the drawing and in the subclaims.<br>
[0011] Figure 1 shows schematically part of an air jet weaving loom<br>
according to the invention.<br>
[0012] Figure 1 shows an air jet weaving loom with a device 1 for<br>
inserting weft threads. The device 1 can optionally blow a weft<br>
thread 2, 3 and/or 4 into a guide channel 5 installed, for example, in<br>
a reed 6 in order to transport a weft thread through a weaving shed<br>
formed by warp threads. The weft threads that are inserted here in<br>
turn according to a pattern, for example, may or may not be of different<br>
types. Here a set of main blowers 7 and 8 is provided for the<br>
weft thread 2, a set of main blowers 9 and 10 for the weft thread 3,<br>
and a set of main blowers 11 and 12 for the weft thread 4. The weft<br>
threads 2, 3 and 4 come from a thread supply unit 13, 14 or 15 respectively.<br>
A thread preparation device 16, 17 or 18 for a weft thread<br>
is provided between each thread supply unit and a corresponding<br>
set of main blowers. A weft thread blown into the guide channel 5 is<br>
then blown further along the guide channel 5 by air jets from a number<br>
of sets of secondary blowers 19, 20, 21 and 22. The air jet<br>
weaving loom shown has four sets of secondary blowers each with<br>
three secondary blowers. According to a variant, it is also possible,<br>
however, for the air jet weaving loom to have a random number of<br>
sets of secondary blowers each with a random number of secondary<br>
blowers.<br><br>
[0013] The reed 6 that comprises a guide channel 5 is provided on a<br>
loom slay 23 by means of a reed holder 6a. The guide channel 5 is<br>
positioned in a weaving shed by means of the movement of the<br>
loom slay 23 in the known manner during the insertion of a weft<br>
thread. At the end of the guide channel 5 positioned opposite the<br>
main blowers a thread monitor 24 is arranged that can determine<br>
when a weft thread arrives at and passes by said thread monitor 24.<br>
The main blowers 7, 9 and 11, the sets of secondary blowers 19, 20,<br>
21, 22 and the thread monitor 24 are mounted here on a loom slay<br>
23 in the known manner. The main blowers 8, 10 and 12, the thread<br>
supply units 13, 14, 15 and the thread preparation device 16, 17 or<br>
18 are arranged at the frame of the air jet weaving loom in the<br>
known manner.<br>
[0014] Furthermore, the air jet weaving loom has a reservoir 25 for<br>
compressed air that is connected to a compressed air supply 27 via<br>
a pressure regulator 26. Between the reservoir 25 and each of the<br>
main blowers 7 to 12 is a pneumatic connection is provided that<br>
comprises, for example, a shut-off valve 28a, 28b, 28c, 28d, 28e,<br>
28f and a corresponding motor-controlled throttle valve 29a, 29b,<br>
29c, 29d, 29e and 29f respectively. Pneumatic connecting lines for<br>
compressed air are also shown that interconnect the above-<br>
mentioned compressed air source 25 and main blowers via the corresponding<br>
shut-off valves and throttle valves. A throttle valve for an<br>
air jet weaving loom is, amongst others, known from and described<br>
in detail in WO 99/64651.<br>
[0015] According to a possibility not shown, a second pneumatic<br>
connection in addition to the above-mentioned pneumatic connection<br>
can also be provided in the known manner between the reservoir<br>
and each main blower in order to supply compressed air at low<br>
pressure to the main blowers while an above-mentioned shut-off<br>
valve is closed. Such a second pneumatic connection can, for ex-<br><br>
ample, comprise a throttle valve and possibly also a non-return<br>
valve.<br>
[0016] By analogy, a shut-off valve 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d, a corresponding<br>
throttle valve 31a, 31b, 31c and 31d and corresponding<br>
pneumatic connecting lines can be provided between the reservoir<br>
25 and each set of secondary blowers 19, 20, 21 and 22. According<br>
to a variant not shown, a separate reservoir can be provided for both<br>
the main blowers and the secondary blowers. According to one variant,<br>
the throttle valves 31a, 31b, 31c and 31d can be omitted.<br>
[0017] The pneumatic connections for the main blowers and the<br>
secondary blowers are of course not limited to the above-mentioned<br>
embodiments with shut-off valves and throttle valves, but can be replaced<br>
by any other known pneumatic connection that can provide,<br>
set or control the supply of compressed air.<br>
[0018] Furthermore, the air jet weaving loom comprises a control<br>
unit 32 that is connected to the shut-off valves and the throttle<br>
valves by electric connecting leads 33 as shown in Figure 1. Each<br>
throttle valve has, for example, a controllable stepping motor that<br>
can be driven in both directions by means of signals from the control<br>
unit 32 in order to be able to supply a desired amount of compressed<br>
air to a weft thread. The shut-off valves consist for example<br>
of electromagnetic valves that at appropriate moments during a<br>
weaving cycle can be opened by the control unit 32 to admit compressed<br>
air in order to transport a weft thread through the guide<br>
channel 5.<br>
[0019] Each thread preparation device 16, 17 and 18 comprises a<br>
control element 34 that permits a weft thread 2, 3 or 4 to be released<br>
and which, for example, is formed by a known magnetic pin. By actuating<br>
the control element 34 by means of the control unit 32, a weft<br>
thread can be released for an insertion. The appropriately long duration of actuating of the control element 34 also allows a length for a<br>
weft thread to be released in the known manner. Each control element<br>
34 is connected to the control unit 32 via electric connecting<br>
leads 33.<br>
[0020] At each thread preparation device 16, 17 and 18, a thread<br>
monitor 35 is provided that, for example, can detect the taking-off of<br>
windings from a thread preparation device 16, 17 and 18. The signals<br>
from such thread monitors 35 can be supplied to the control unit<br>
32 via electric connecting leads 45, 45a in the same way as the signals<br>
from the thread monitor 24.<br>
[0021] The weaving loom shown in Figure 1 also comprises a drive<br>
motor 36 that drives the loom slay 23 back and forth by means of a<br>
drive element 37 and a drive mechanism 38. Such a drive element<br>
37 is described i.a. in WO 98/31856. Here, the drive motor 36 is<br>
turned, for example, one complete revolution during each insertion<br>
so that the angular position of the drive shaft of the drive motor 36 is<br>
the same as the angular position of the weaving loom. The angular<br>
position of the drive motor 36 can be determined here by means of<br>
an angle sensor 39 that, for example, is connected to the control unit<br>
32 of the weaving loom via an electric connecting lead 46. The drive<br>
element 37 comprises, for example, a gear wheel transmission while<br>
the drive mechanism 38, for example, comprises a cam mechanism.<br>
The drive motor 36 is connected to the control unit 32 via an electric<br>
connecting lead 47.<br>
[0022] According to one embodiment, the drive motor 36 also drives<br>
via the drive element 37 a shed drive unit 40 that forms part of shed<br>
forming means that enable a weaving shed to be formed with warp<br>
threads. The shed forming means can, for example, comprise weaving<br>
frames in the known manner that are driven up and down. This<br>
allows a weaving shed to be formed in synchronization with the<br>
weaving cycle. According to a variant not shown, the shed forming<br><br>
means can also comprise a shed drive unit that is driven by dedicated<br>
drive means that move more or less synchronously with the<br>
weaving cycle.<br>
[0023] The control unit 32 of the weaving loom has a control device<br>
41 for one or more control parameters for an insertion, a control device<br>
42 for one or more control parameters for a weaving cycle and<br>
a selection device 43 for control of the above-mentioned control device<br>
 41 for at least one control parameter for an insertion and/or the<br>
above-mentioned control device 42 for at least one control parameter<br>
for a weaving cycle. Furthermore, the control unit 32 has an<br>
evaluating device 44 for determining a representative value for at<br>
least one actual insertion parameter. The evaluating device 44 can<br>
cooperate with the selection device 43.<br>
[0024] Before applying the method according to the invention, it is<br>
assumed that basic values for the control parameters for the insertions<br>
for the weft threads 2, 3 or 4 to be successively inserted and<br>
for the control parameters for the weaving cycle of the weaving loom<br>
have been stored in the control unit 32 of the weaving loom. Limit<br>
values can also be stored for each of the control parameters, between<br>
which these control parameters can be set or varied without<br>
risk, in other words a range can be provided for the control parameters.<br>
Such a range is limited by a minimum and a maximum limit<br>
value for a control parameter. The basic value for a control parameter<br>
naturally lies within this range and lies, for example, roughly in<br>
the middle between the two limit values.<br>
[0025] The stored basic values and/or the stored limit values, in<br>
other words the stored range, can be input via an input unit 48 that<br>
interacts with the control unit 32. The control unit 32 can also be<br>
connected to a display 49 in order to make all values for the insertion<br>
parameters and all values for the control parameters visible for<br>
an operator. It is clear that the control parameters for the insertion of<br><br>
each successive weft thread 2, 3 or 4 can be stored according to a<br>
weaving pattern. During weaving, the control parameters for the different<br>
successive weft threads to be inserted can be controlled in<br>
accordance with the weaving pattern.<br>
[0026] A representative value for at least one actual insertion parameter<br>
is first determined using an evaluating device 44. According<br>
to one embodiment, such a value can be determined as a mean<br>
value over a number of insertions from the time difference between<br>
a moment when a weft thread arrives at the thread monitor 24 and a<br>
moment when the angle sensor 39 reaches a given angular position.<br>
The number of insertions for determining a mean value can also be<br>
set, for example twenty insertions, or can be automatically varied as<br>
a function of actual insertion parameters, for example between four<br>
and two hundred insertions.<br>
[0027] If a representative value determined as described above deviates<br>
from a preset value, then according to a first possibility the<br>
selection device 43 can select an algorithm in order to vary a control<br>
parameter for an insertion so that a value determined as described<br>
above for a successive weft thread to be inserted comes closer to<br>
the preset value, or the deviation between the above-mentioned values<br>
comes closer to a preset deviation. If the above-mentioned deviation<br>
from a preset value for the weft thread 2 indicates a too<br>
slowly inserted weft thread, the throttle valve 29a, for example,<br>
should be opened more so that more compressed air is supplied to<br>
a successive weft thread to be inserted so that it can be expected<br>
that said successive weft thread to be inserted will be inserted<br>
faster. It is clear that an adaption of a control parameter only needs<br>
to be carried out if such a deviation exceeds a certain minimum<br>
value, in other words if there is a sufficient deviation that requires an<br>
adaption. According to a variant possibility, for example, one or<br>
more signals from the thread monitor 35 can be used instead of a<br><br>
signal from the thread monitor 24 in order to determine a representative<br>
value for at least one current insertion parameter.<br>
[0028] According to another possibility, the selection device 43 can<br>
select an algorithm that can vary a control parameter for a weaving<br>
cycle in such a way that the determined value for a successive weft<br>
thread to be inserted comes closer to the preset value, or the deviation<br>
comes closer to a preset deviation. If the above-mentioned deviation<br>
for the weft thread 2 indicates a too slowly inserted weft<br>
thread, the weaving speed of the weaving loom will be reduced, for<br>
example, so that it can be expected that a successive weft thread to<br>
be inserted arrives at the thread monitor 24 at a preset angular position<br>
of the angle sensor 39, in other words of the drive motor 36. As<br>
with the above-mentioned variant possibility, use can be made here<br>
also, for example, of one or more signals from a thread monitor 35<br>
that detects the passage of a winding of a weft thread. The weaving<br>
speed or the rotational speed of the drive motor 36 can be controlled<br>
in a manner similar to that described in EP 1032867 B1.<br>
[0029] The invention comprises the choice or selection of which control<br>
parameter or control parameters are to be varied according to an<br>
algorithm under given circumstances in order to obtain a desired<br>
weaving result. For example, the following basic values for certain<br>
control parameters are provided that according to the invention<br>
should be considered for adaption:<br>
Throttle valve 29a	85%<br>
Throttle valve 29b	75%<br>
Throttle valve 29c	80%<br>
Throttle valve 29d	70%<br>
Throttle valve 29e	82%<br>
Throttle valve 29f	74%<br>
Rotational speed	800 revolutions/minute<br><br>
[0030] 65% and 98% are taken, for example, as limit values for the<br>
control parameters for the throttle valves. This means that the control<br>
parameters for the throttle valves can be adapted or varied between<br>
65% and 98%. The range for the rotational speed is limited,<br>
for example, by limit values of 760 and 820 revolutions/ minute.<br>
[0031] If the value determined by the evaluating device 44 indicates<br>
that the weft thread 2 arrives too early, the selection means 43 can<br>
control the control device 42 in such a way that, for example, the<br>
throttle valve 29a is automatically adapted from 85% to 82% and the<br>
throttle valve 29b from 75% to 72%. If the weft thread 3 also arrives<br>
too early, the throttle valves 29c and 29d can, for example, be<br>
adapted analogously from 80% and 70% to 78% and 68% respectively.<br>
If the weft thread 4 also arrives too early, the throttle valves<br>
29e and 29f can, for example, be adapted analogously from 82%<br>
and 74% to 80% and 72% respectively. In this case in which a lower<br>
value for the throttle valves is set for all the weft threads, the selection<br>
device 43 can control the control device 42 for the weaving cycle<br>
in such a way that a control parameter for the weaving cycle is<br>
adapted according to an algorithm. In this case, this means that the<br>
rotational speed of the weaving loom can be increased, for example<br>
from 800 revolutions/minute to 805 revolutions/minute. Subsequently,<br>
the selection device 43 can furthermore control the control<br>
device 41 for each weft thread according to an algorithm in such a<br>
way that said weft thread does not arrive too early or too late by<br>
adapting one or more control parameters for an insertion according<br>
to an algorithm.<br>
[0032] If, for example, the weft threads still arrive too early and, for<br>
example, the rotational speed has reached the maximum limit value<br>
of 820 revolutions/ minute, the selection means 43 will then only<br>
adapt the control means 41 for the insertion and no longer the control<br>
means 42 for the weaving cycle. By analogy, if for example the<br>
throttle valve 29b is set to the limit value 98% and the throttle valve<br><br>
29a is also set to the limit value 98%, the selection device 43 will<br>
then only adapt the control parameters for the weaving cycle and,<br>
for example, set the rotational speed of the weaving loom lower. The<br>
algorithm is selected here in such a way that the control parameters<br>
do not exceed their set limit values. The intention here, for example,<br>
is to ensure that the control parameters for the insertion do not exceed<br>
their limit values and that the control parameters for the weaving<br>
cycle set the rotational speed as high as possible.<br>
[0033] The invention can be advantageously applied to weaving<br>
looms that weave according to a speed pattern, in other words<br>
where consecutive insertions are woven with a different weaving<br>
speed or where the control parameters for the weaving cycle can be<br>
varied from weft to weft. If for the weft thread 2 in the above-<br>
mentioned example, for example, the control parameters for the<br>
throttle valves 29a and 29b become lower than 80% and 70% respectively,<br>
this can result in the selection means 43 varying one or<br>
more control parameters for the weaving cycle or the rotational<br>
speed with which the weft thread 2 is woven from 800 to 805 revolutions/minute<br>
via the control device 42. Subsequently, the value for<br>
the throttle valves can rise again in the direction of the basic values<br>
of 85% and 75%. If the other weft threads are not transported faster,<br>
weaving will only be carried out at a higher rotational speed for the<br>
weft thread 2. This allows the rotational speed of the weaving loom<br>
to be adapted for each weft thread in such a way that the set basic<br>
value for the throttle valves remains more or less constant. This also<br>
permits weaving to be carried out faster without blowing too strongly<br>
on a weft thread and without causing additional weft faults.<br>
[0034] It is clear that different algorithms can be selected. The intention<br>
is that the weaving loom itself selects a rotational speed for the<br>
weaving cycle at which one or more weft threads are woven by controlling<br>
the control parameters. With the control of the control parameters<br>
for an insertion, the supply of compressed air can be<br><br>
adapted or regulated in such a way that a representative value for a<br>
measured insertion parameter corresponds to a desired value for<br>
said insertion parameter. By adapting the rotational speed, it is possible<br>
to keep the control parameters for an insertion, such as the<br>
setting of the throttle valves, more or less constant or within their<br>
limit values. By adapting the control parameters for an insertion, it is<br>
also possible in reverse to keep the rotational speed within the limit<br>
values.<br>
[0035] The selection means 43 take account here of a set basic<br>
value for the different control parameters and of limit values between<br>
which these control parameters should lie. It is clear that the selection<br>
means 43 should control the control parameters for an insertion<br>
and the control parameters for a weaving cycle in such a way that<br>
these lie as close as possible to their basic value and do not exceed<br>
their limit values. In order to achieve an increase in the production of<br>
woven fabric, it is preferable however to set the rotational speed of<br>
the weaving loom as high as possible and to subsequently leave the<br>
throttle valves set more or less to their basic value.<br>
[0036] According to a variant embodiment, a control parameter for<br>
an insertion is first adapted for each weft thread until it reaches, for<br>
example, an intermediate value. A first intermediate value for the<br>
throttle valve 29a for the weft thread 2, for example, can be 90%;<br>
this is a value that lies between the basic value of 80% and the<br>
maximum limit value of 98%. A second intermediate value can be<br>
72%. This is a value that lies between the basic value of 80% and<br>
the minimum limit value of 65%. If for the weft thread 2 the setting<br>
for the throttle valve 29a reaches an intermediate value of 90%, the<br>
selection means 43 will subsequently allow the rotational speed of<br>
the weaving loom to drop. Subsequently, the selection device 43 will<br>
again control a control parameter for the throttle valve 29a. If the<br>
control parameter again reaches the intermediate value 90%, the<br>
selection device 43 will again command the control unit 42 to reduce<br><br>
the rotational speed of the weaving loom. By analogy, in the event of<br>
the intermediate value of 72% being reached for a control parameter<br>
for the throttle valve 29a, the selection device 43 will command the<br>
control unit 42 to adapt a control parameter for the weaving cycle so<br>
that the rotational speed of the weaving loom is increased.<br>
[0037] It is clear that the invention can be most advantageously employed<br>
if the rotational speed is not to be reduced rapidly and is to<br>
be increased relatively quickly. In the above-mentioned case, for example,<br>
76% and 96% can be selected as limit values for the throttle<br>
valve 29a. This allows weaving to be carried out faster for a certain<br>
period without any significant risk of an insertion parameter exceeding<br>
a limit value.<br>
[0038] Other algorithms can naturally also be used according to the<br>
invention. For example, the control parameters for an insertion can<br>
first be adapted until they reach an intermediate value and then the<br>
rotational speed of the weaving loom can be adapted until it also<br>
reaches an intermediate value. An intermediate value for the rotational<br>
speed of the weaving loom in the example can be 810 revolutions/minute.<br>
After reaching said intermediate value for the rotational<br>
speed, the control parameters for an insertion can subsequently be<br>
controlled again until they reach a given intermediate value, and<br>
subsequently the rotational speed of the weaving loom is adapted<br>
again until a following intermediate value is reached, for example<br>
815 revolutions/minute. In this way, the selection device can cause<br>
to adapt according to a certain selection method or a certain algorithm<br>
either a control parameter for an insertion or a control parameter<br>
for a weaving cycle according to a suitable algorithm in order to<br>
transport certain weft threads into a weaving shed at an appropriate<br>
rotational speed of the weaving loom using appropriate control signals<br>
for an insertion. By analogy, an intermediate value of 790 revolutions/ minute<br>
or 785 revolutions/minute can be determined if the<br>
rotational speed is to be reduced. In this way, the rotational speed of<br><br>
the weaving loom is only adapted at given moments while the control<br>
parameters for an insertion can be adapted more or less continuously.<br>
[0039] Another possible selection method can consist, alternately, in<br>
a case that a given insertion parameter further envolves in the same<br>
direction in adapting a control parameter for an insertion and in appropriately adapting a control parameter for a weaving cycle. In the<br>
case of a weft thread that becomes easier to transport by air as it is<br>
woven further off a bobbin, this means for example that the throttle<br>
valve 29a should first be adapted from 85% to 83% and subsequently the rotational speed should be adapted from 800 to 805<br>
revolutions/minute, subsequently the throttle valve 29a should be<br>
adapted to 81%, then the rotational speed should be adapted to 810<br>
revolutions/minute, then the throttle valve 29a should be adapted to<br>
79%, and so on. The alternating adaption of control parameters for<br>
an insertion and control parameters for a weaving cycle enables a<br>
stable system to be obtained.<br>
[0040] According to a further selection method, an algorithm can be<br>
selected with which not only at least one control parameter for an<br>
insertion is adapted but also a control parameter for a weaving cycle. According to a variant selection method, not only at least one<br>
control parameter for a weaving cycle but also a control parameter<br>
for an insertion is adapted. If, for example, a large change in an insertion parameter is discovered, for example after a changeover<br>
from an empty bobbin to a full bobbin, so that the weft thread arrives<br>
far too late, both the rotational speed of the weaving loom can be<br>
decreased and the throttling by the throttle valves can be reduced at<br>
the same time. In the case of a significant change in an insertion parameter, this enables a desired setting of the control parameters to<br>
be quickly achieved through a combined action of control parameters for an insertion and of control parameters for a weaving cycle.<br><br>
[0041] In the event that all the weft threads are woven at the same<br>
rotational speed, a choice can be made to adapt the rotational<br>
speed to the setting of the control parameters for a given weft<br>
thread. The most critical weft thread is normally selected for this, in<br>
other words the weft thread that is most sensitive to changes in an<br>
insertion parameter. In the event that the weft thread 2 is chosen,<br>
the throttle valve 29a should for example, be changed between values of 82% to 88% in the above-mentioned example. The rotational<br>
speed of the weaving loom can then be subsequently adapted so<br>
that the throttle valve 29a remains set in each case between 82%<br>
and 88%. If the throttle valves 29b to 29e hereby exceed their range,<br>
then it can be decided not to change the rotational speed further and<br>
the throttle valve 29a can, for example, be changed further beyond<br>
the above-mentioned values until the limit values of 65% and 98%<br>
are reached. This offers the advantage that the most critical weft<br>
thread can normally be woven with basic values for a throttle valve,<br>
while the less critical weft threads will be subjected to a larger<br>
change in the settings of the corresponding throttle valves.<br>
[0042] It is clear that an insertion parameter does not necessarily<br>
have to be determined on the basis of a signal from a single thread<br>
monitor. Signals from both a thread monitor 24 and from a thread<br>
monitor 35 can also be used to determine an insertion parameter.<br>
This offers the advantage that an incorrectly measured signal from<br>
one of the thread monitors can be easily detected by comparing the<br>
signals from the different thread monitors with one another.<br>
[0043] The insertion parameters for the sets of secondary blowers<br>
19, 20, 21 and 22 are preferably input and stored in the control unit<br>
32 as a function of the angular position of the weaving loom. This<br>
offers the advantage that in the case of a change or adaption of the<br>
weaving speed, the control parameters for the secondary blowers<br>
can be retained and/or the control times for the shut-off valves for<br><br>
the secondary blowers can be easily converted into time signals on<br>
the basis of the angular positions.<br>
[0044] The same can be provided for the control times of the shut-off<br>
valves for the main blowers. It is thus clear that the moments when<br>
the shut-off valves are actuated are dependent on the rotational<br>
speed of the weaving loom, but that the control parameters for the<br>
shut-off valves that are determined as angular positions do not have<br>
to be changed. It is of course also possible to also adapt the control<br>
parameters for the shut-off valves when changing the rotational<br>
speed of the weaving loom.<br>
[0045] Notwithstanding the control parameters for the throttle valves<br>
described in the examples are regulated, according to a variant the<br>
pressure regulator 26, for example, can also be regulated and/or<br>
controlled as a control parameter for an insertion in order to influence an insertion parameter. The control times of the shut-off<br>
valves, the control times of a control element 34 and other control<br>
parameters for an insertion can also be selected as control parameters for an insertion. Preference is given, however, to the choice of a<br>
control parameter for a throttle valve for a main blower as control<br>
parameter for an insertion.<br>
[0046] It is clear that the percentage settings for the throttle valves<br>
and the rotational speeds of the weaving loom are only given as examples and can be easily replaced by other settings or parameters.<br>
These percentages can be replaced, for example, by positions of the<br>
throttle valves that are expressed for example in steps of a stepping<br>
motor for a throttle valve in relation to a reference position of the<br>
throttle valve.<br>
[0047] In the description, the control devices 41 and 42, the selection device 43 and the evaluating device 44 are described as separate devices for the sake of clarity with a function being allocated to<br><br>
each device. It is clear, however, that they can be physically integrated into a single device, for example into one single electronic<br>
printed circuit board.<br>
[0048] The invention can be easily employed on a weaving loom that<br>
is already equipped with a controllable drive motor 36 in order to be<br>
able to adapt the weaving speed. It is clear that such a weaving<br>
loom is not limited to the illustrative embodiments. According to a<br>
variant embodiment, a drive motor can drive the loom slay 23 directly, for example in a manner as described in WO 98/31856.<br>
[0049] In addition to the above-mentioned thread monitors 24 and<br>
35, other thread monitors can of course be used that allow an actual<br>
insertion parameter to be determined. It is obvious that the weaving<br>
loom is not limited to an air jet weaving loom on which a weft thread<br>
is blown directly into a guide channel 5 with compressed air, but that<br>
the weaving loom can consist of any other kind of weaving loom on<br>
which a weft thread is transported into a weaving shed by means of<br>
compressed air.<br>
[0050] The invention can be particularly advantageously employed<br>
for the weaving of weft threads where the characteristics of the weft<br>
threads change, depending on their position in a thread supply unit<br>
or bobbin, such as is the case for example with some filament<br>
threads.<br>
