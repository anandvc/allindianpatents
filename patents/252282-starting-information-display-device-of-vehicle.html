[Title of the Invention] STARTING INFORMATION DISPLAY DEVICE<br>
OF VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a starting information display device of a vehicle which includes an engine capable of using a mixed fuel which is produced by mixing plural kinds of fuels. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Recently, a vehicle which includes an internal combustion engine (engine) capable of using not only gasoline which has been used as a fuel conventionally but also a mixed fuel which is produced by mixing plural kinds of fuel has been practically used. Here, as such a mixed fuel, a fuel which is produced by mixing alcohol (methanol or ethanol) or the like into gasoline is considered. However, gasoline and alcohol differ from each other in vaporization latent heat, a flash point and the like and hence, when alcohol which exhibits inferior low-temperature startability compared to gasoline is supplied to a tank, the startability is lowered at the time of low temperature where the environmental temperature is low. Accordingly, there has been proposed a fuel changeover device of an engine which is configured such that two tanks, that is, a tank dedicated to<br><br>
gasoline and a tank for alcohol or a mixed fuel are independently provided from each other and, at the time of starting the engine at a low temperature, gasoline is supplied to a carburetor or a fuel injection device from the tank dedicated to gasoline so as to ensure the favorable startability (for example, see patent document 1)â€¢ [0003]<br>
[Patent document 1] JP-UM-A-61-155652 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve] [0004]<br>
However, in the above-mentioned prior art, a plurality of control valves (or fuel injection devices) for selecting the fuel tank and the supply fuel becomes necessary and hence, the constitution of a fuel supply system becomes complicated and, at the same time, a manufacturing cost is pushed up. Accordingly, in a vehicle (a relatively small-sized four-wheeled vehicle, two-wheeled vehicle, small-sized particular-use vehicle or the like, for example) which renders mounting of a plurality of fuel tanks, control valves or the like difficult, it is difficult to prevent lowering of the startability in a low-temperature environment at the time of using the mixed fuel. [0005]<br>
On the other hand, when the lowering of the startability<br><br>
when the mixed fuel is used derived from an environmental condition, that is, when the environmental temperature is lowered and it is difficult to ensure the favorable startability with a present mixing ratio in the inside of the tank, gasoline exhibiting favorable low-temperature startability is replenished to increase a mixing ratio of the gasoline in the fuel thus improving the low-temperature startability. However, when the favorable startability cannot be obtained due to cranking, a driver cannot determine whether a course of unfavorable startability is derived from a drawback on a system such as a malfunction of the engine or an environmental condition, [0006]<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome such drawbacks, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a device having the simple and inexpensive constitution which, when lowering of startability is expected, allows a driver to recognize such a situation prior to starting an engine.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0007]<br>
To achieve an object of the present invention by overcoming the above-mentioned drawbacks, according to the present invention, in a vehicle having an engine capable of using a mixed fuel which is produced by mixing plural kinds of<br><br>
fuels, a starting information display device is configured to include an air temperature detector (an intake air temperature sensor 13 or an outside air temperature sensor 18 in embodiments/ for example) which detects temperature of an outside air or an air taken into the engine, and a display means (an ECU 20, a starting display unit 35 in the embodiments, for example) which performs a display on startability of the engine prior to starting of the engine based on the temperature of the outside air or the intake air detected by the air temperature detector. [0008]<br>
In the present invention, a display part (an indicator lamp 4 6, an information display device 55 in the embodiment, for example) in the display means may preferably be mounted on a traveling display device (meter units 40, 50 in the embodiments, for example) which displays a traveling state of a vehicle to a driver. [0009]<br>
In the present invention, the display means may preferably be configured to display the information when the temperature of the outside air or the intake air detected by the air temperature detector is below a predetermined starting<br>
temperature (predetermined temperature T0, T01, T02, T03, T04, and a characteristic curve Dc in the embodiments, for example) which is preset based on influence which lowers the startability of the engine when the mixed fuel is used.<br><br>
[0010]<br>
Further, the starting information display device further includes a warm-up state detection means (a water temperature detector 15 in the embodiments, for example) which detects a warm-up state of the engine, and the display means may preferably be configured to change over the predetermined starting temperature in response to the warm-up state of the engine detected by the warm-up state detection means.<br>
[0011]<br>
Further, the starting information display device further includes an oxygen concentration detection means (an oxygen concentration detection sensor 17 in the embodiments, for example) which detects the concentration of oxygen contained in an exhaust gas from the engine, and a mixing ratio estimation means (an ECU 20 in the embodiments, for example) which estimates a mixing ratio of the plural Icinds of fuels in the mixed fuel in response to the concentration of oxygen detected by the oxygen concentration detection means, and the display means may preferably be configured to change over the predetermined starting temperature (predetermined temperatures T0, T01, TO2, TO3, To4, and characteristic curve Dc in the embodiments, for example) in response to the mixing ratio estimated by the mixing ratio estimation means,<br>
[Advantageous of the Invention]<br>
[0012]<br><br>
The starting information display device according to the present invention is configured to include the display means which performs the display on the startability of the engine prior to the starting of the engine based on the temperature of the outside air or the intake air detected by the air temperature detector. Due to such a constitution, the influence which is asserted on the startability of the engine based on a change of an environmental temperature is displayed by the display means and hence, a driver can recognize whether the startability of the engine is in a good condition or a bad condition under such an environment prior to starting of the engine thus providing a vehicle which has the simple constitution, can be manufactured at a low cost, and can enhance the drivability. [0013]<br>
In the present invention, by mounting the display part of the display means on the traveling display device which displays the traveling state of the vehicle to the driver (a speed meter, a tachometer, a composite display meter, a meter unit which includes various indicator lamps, or the like, for example), the driver can obtain the favorable visibility and, at the same time, the driver never fails to focus his/her attention to the display part when the engine is started and hence, the display part can surely transmit the starting information to the driver.<br><br>
Further, by constituting the starting information display device such that the information is displayed when the temperature detected by the air temperature detector becomes lower than the predetermined starting temperature which is preset based on the influence which lowers the startability of the engine at the time of using the mixed fuel, when the worsening of startability of the engine is expected due to the lowering of the environmental temperature, such information is displayed prior to the starting of the engine to attract an attention of the driver and hence, the driver can clearly recognize the lowering of the startability based on environmental conditions . [0015]<br>
By constituting the starting information display device such that the predetermined starting temperature is changed over in response to the warm-up state of the engine detected by the warm-up state detection means, the starting information display device is correlated with the warm-up state of the engine. Accordingly, even when the intake temperature suddenly changes or the engine is re-started in a state that the engine is warmed-up, it is possible to stably display information on the startability of the engine displayed by the display means and, at the same time, the display accuracy can be enhanced by approximating the display by the display means to the good or bad condition of the actual startability.<br><br>
Further, the starting information display device may be configured such that the starting information display device includes the oxygen concentration detection means which detects the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas and the mixing ratio estimation means which estimates the mixing ratio of the mixed fuel based on the detected oxygen concentration, and the display means changes over the starting temperature in response to the mixing ratio estimated by the mixing ratio estimation means . As mentioned previously, the startability of the engine when the engine is at the low temperature changes depending on a kind of fuels to be mixed and the mixing ratio, wherein the higher the mixing ratio of gasoline, the lower the starting temperature at which the startability is lowered becomes. Accordingly, by constituting the starting information display device such that the starting temperature is changed over in response to the mixing ratio estimated by the mixing ratio estimation means, the starting information display device can transmit the starting information with high probability in response to the kind and the mixing ratio of the mixed fuel actually stored in the inside of a tank to the driver. [0017]<br>
Due to such constitution, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide the starting information display device having the simple and inexpensive constitution<br><br>
which, when lowering of startability is expected, allows the<br>
driver to recognize such a situation prior to the starting of<br>
the engine.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
[0018]<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic constitutional view of a starting information display device including an internal combustion engine of a vehicle to which the present invention is applied. An engine 1 is configured such that the engine 1 can use a mixed fuel which is produced by mixing plural kinds of fuels. For example, the engine is operated by burning the mixed fuel which is produced by mixing ethanol and gasoline. On an intake pipe<br>
2	which introduces air into the engine 1, an air cleaner 3, a throttle valve 4 and an injector 5 are mounted from an upstream side. A flow rate of the intake air purified by the air cleaner<br>
3	is adjusted by the throttle valve 4, and the intake air is mixed with fuel injected from the injector 5, and the air/fuel mixture is supplied to the engine 1. A three-way catalyst 8 is mounted on a downstream side of an exhaust pipe 7 of the engine 1 to purify contents such as HC, CO or NOx in an exhaust gas. The injector 5 is connected to a control device for controlling an operation of the engine 1, that is, an ECU (Electric Control Unit) 20. The injector 5 injects a quantity of mixed fuel in proportion to an injection time into the inside of the intake pipe 2 in response to an injection control signal including the<br><br>
injection time from the ECU 20. A starting display unit 35 is connected to the ECU 20 and displays the influence which an environmental condition asserts on the startability of the engine in response to a display control signal from the ECU 20. [0019]<br>
To the throttle valve 4, a throttle opening sensor (hereinafter, described as TH sensor) 11 which detects opening (throttle opening TH) of the throttle valve 4 is connected. The throttle valve 4 is constituted of a potentiometer which detects an open/close angle position of a valve element in the throttle valve 4, for example. Between the throttle valve 4 and the engine 1, an intake pressure sensor (hereinafter, described as Pb sensor) 12 which detects a pressure (intake pressure Pb) in the inside of the intake pipe 2, and an intake temperature sensor (hereinafter, described as TA sensor) 13 which detects a temperature of air (TA) taken into the inside of the intake pipe 2 are arranged. For example, an absolute-pressure-type pressure sensor is used as the Pb sensor 12 so as to detect an absolute pressure in the inside of the intake pipe 2. The TH sensor 11, the Pb sensor 12, and the TA sensor 13 are connected to the ECU 20, and detection information from the respective sensors is inputted to the ECU 20. [0020]<br>
On the engine 1, a water temperature sensor (hereinafter, described as TW sensor) 15 which detects a temperature of<br><br>
cooling water (TW) for cooling the engine, and crank angle sensor (hereinafter, described as CRK sensor) 16 which detects an angular position of the crankshaft (crank angle CRK) are mounted. On the exhaust pipe 7, an oxygen concentration sensor (hereinafter, described as 02 sensor) 17 which detects the concentration of oxygen contained in the exhaust gas is mounted. Here, this embodiment describes a constitutional example of the starting information display device when the engine 1 is a water-cooled engine. The TW sensor 15, the CRK sensor 16 and the 02 sensor 17 are connected to the ECU 20, and the detection information of the respective sensors are inputted to the ECU 20. [0021]<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the internal constitution of the ECU 20. The ECU 20 includes a CPU 21, a RAM 22, a ROM 23 and an EEP-ROM 24, and these parts are mutually connected with each other via an internal bus in the inside of the ECU 20. The TH sensor 11, the PBA sensor 12, the TA sensor 13, the TW sensor 15, the CRK sensor 16, and the 02 sensor 17 are connected to the CPU 21 via an I/O bus, and detection information detected by the respective sensors is inputted to the CPU 21. Further, the injector 5 is connected to the CPU 21 via the I/O bus, wherein by outputting the injection control signal to the injector 5, it is possible to allow the injector 5 to inject a quantity of mixed fuel corresponding to the<br><br>
injection time included in the injection control signal. [0022]<br>
The RAM 22 is used as an operational region of a control program which is operated in the CPU 21 or the like. The RAM 22 is a memory device which erases the information stored in the inside thereof when the supply of the electricity is stopped. The ROM 23 is a memory device which preliminarily sets and stores a control program which is operated by the CPU 21, and a Pb/Ne map, a Ne/TH map, a correction coefficient table, a starting control information and the like which constitute control information for controlling the engine 1. The ROM 23 is also a memory device which holds the information stored in the inside thereof without erasing the information even when the supply of electricity is stopped. The EEP-ROM 24 is a memory device which performs writing and erasing of the information by the CPU 21 during the operation of the CUP 21 and holds the information stored in the inside thereof without erasing the information even when the supply of electricity is stopped. [0023]<br>
The starting display unit 35 is mounted on a traveling display device which displays a traveling state of a vehicle to a driver. Fig. 3 is a front view of a meter unit 40 of a motorcycle which constitutes one example of the traveling display device. The meter unit 40 is constituted of a tachometer 42 which is arranged on an approximately center<br><br>
portion of a front face thereof, a speed meter 4 3 which is arranged in front of the tachometer 42, information display devices 44, 45 which are arranged on left and right sides of the speed meter 43, and various indicator lamps 46 which are arranged on left and right sides of the tachometer 42 and the like. The starting display unit 35 is formed as one of the indicator lamps mounted on such a meter unit 40, for example, the indicator lamp 46d. [0024]<br>
Further, Fig. 4 is a front view of a meter unit 50 of a motorcycle which constitutes another constitutional example of the traveling display device. The meter unit 50 includes a tachometer 52 and a speed meter 53 which are arranged in the lateral direction, information display devices 54, 55 and various indicator lamps 56 which are positioned between these meters 52, 53 and are mounted on a center portion of the unit, a main switch (main SW) 58 which is arranged on a side of the information display devices close to the driver and the like. The starting display unit 35 is provided as one of the information display devices on the meter unit 50, for example, as the information display device 55. The starting display unit 35 is constituted by using an indicator-type meter, a liquid crystal display device or the like. Here, in Fig. 3 and Fig, 4, a constitutional example which mounts the starting display unit 35 on the meter unit of the motorcycle is shown. However,<br><br>
in a four-wheeled vehicle or the like, a similar display unit<br>
may be configured to be mounted on a meter unit on a driver's<br>
seat (so-called inner panel portion).<br>
[0025]<br>
(Principle of engine control)<br>
Next, the principle of the control of the engine 1 by the ECU 20 is explained. The engine 1 is operated in a suitable state when the air/fuel ratio which is a ratio between air which flows through the intake pipe 2 and the fuel which is injected from the injector 5 assumes a proper value. Here, the air/fuel ratio is expressed as a value which is obtained by dividing the air quantity by the fuel quantity. To operate the engine 1 at an optimum state under various conditions, the ECU 20, calculates the proper injection fuel quantity (injection time) and performs a control to allow the injector 5 to inject the calculated quantity of injection fuel. As a calculation method of the fuel injection quantity by the ECU 20, depending on the difference in the required injection fuel quantity, methods which differ from each other are adopted between at the time of starting the engine 1 and at the time of performing the usual operation of the engine 1. Here, the injection fuel quantity is regulated based on the injection time of fuel which is injected from the injector 5, and the usual operation time indicates a state in which the engine 1 performs a self traveling operation without relying on a starter motor or the like.<br><br>
The injection quantity of fuel necessary for starting the engine 1, that is, the starting injection time (TICR) of the injector 5 shows a tendency that, as general characteristics on the startability of the engine 1 shown in Fig. 5 indicate, the higher the environmental temperature at the time of starting the engine 1, the shorter the preferable starting injection time TICR becomes (the injection quantity is decreased), and the lower the environmental temperature, the longer the preferable starting injection time TICR becomes (the injection quantity is increased). Further, in Fig. 5, the general characteristic on the startability of the engine when the fuel is ethanol is indicated by a solid line, and the general characteristic on the startability of the engine when the fuel is gasoline is indicated by a dotted line. As shown in the drawing, according to an experiment, the above-mentioned tendency appears more markedly when the fuel is ethanol, and when the environmental temperature becomes lower than a predetermined temperature T0<br>
(for example, approximately 10Â°C) , the preferable starting injection time TICR is rapidly prolonged.<br>
[0027]<br>
This implies that when the environmental temperature at<br>
the time of starting the engine is high, irrespective of the<br>
mixing ratio of the fuel stored in the fuel tank, the favorable<br>
startability can be ensured within an approximately fixed short<br><br>
injection time, while when the environmental temperature becomes lower than the predetermined temperature T0, depending on the mixing ratio of the fuel (in a state that the mixing ratio of ethanol is high), the injection time corresponding to the environmental temperature becomes necessary for ensuring the favorable startability and, when the starting injection time TICR is short, there exists a possibility that the startability is worsened. [0028] (Starting information display device of first embodiment)<br>
In view of the above result, in the starting information display device of the first embodiment, the environmental temperature T0 which requires setting of the starting injection time TICR corresponding to the environmental temperature depending on the mixing ratio of the fuel, is preliminarily stored in the ROM 23, When a main switch is turned on, the temperature T0 which the CPU 21 reads from the ROM 23 and a detection value of the intake air temperature TA (or the detection value of the outside air temperature TA' inputted from the outside air temperature sensor 18) inputted from the TA sensor 13 are compared with each other, and the influence which is asserted on the startabi y of the engine 1 is displayed on the starting display unit 35. [0029]<br>
To be more specific, in the starting information display<br><br>
device which is configured to use the indicator lamp 46d as the starting display unit 35, when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA (or the outside air temperature TA' , this definition being applied hereinafter in the same manner) is equal to or below To so that there exists a possibility of worsening of startability, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on, while when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T0 so that the worsening of startability is not expected, the indicator lamp 46d is turned off. Alternatively, an LED or the like which can emit light in plural colors is used as the indicator lamp 46d, and when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA is equal to or below the predetermined temperature T0 so that there exists a possibility of worsening the startability, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on in red, while when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T0 so that worsening of startability is not expected, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on in green. [0030]<br>
According to the starting information display device having such a con titution, when the temperature at the time of turning on the main switch exceeds the predetermined temperature To, the indicator lamp 46d assumes a turn-off state (the indicator lamp 4 6d being turned on in green in the constitutional example which uses the LED or the like capable<br><br>
of emitting light in plural colors) and hence, the driver is informed of the information that worsening of startability based on the environmental temperature is not expected, while when the temperature becomes equal to or below the predetermined temperature To, the indicator lamp 4 6d is turned on (the indicator lamp 4 6d being turned on in red in the above-mentioned constitutional example) , and hence, the driver is informed of the information that when the mixing ratio of ethanol in the fuel is high, there exists a possibility that it is difficult to start the engine 1. Accordingly, the driver can recognize whether the startability of the engine under the present environment is in a good condition or in a bad condition prior to starting of the engine. [0031]<br>
Here, also as shown in Fig. 5, the starting information display device may be configured such that besides the temperature which requires setting of the starting injection time TICK corresponding to the environmental temperature when the mixing ratio of ethanol is high due to the mixing ratio of fuel, that is, the temperature To which has a possibility of influencing the startability of the engine (or in place of To) f a temperature which requires setting of the starting injection time TICR corresponding to the environmental temperature when the mixing ratio of ethanol is set to a predetermined value or more (for example, when the mixing ratio of ethanol is 50% or<br><br>
more), that is, a temperature T1 which has a high possibility of worsening the startability of the engine when the mixed fuel is used as the fuel, is preliminarily stored in the ROM 23, and the temperature Ti is displayed on the starting display unit 3 5 in the same manner as the above-mentioned starting information. [0032]<br>
For example, when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature To, the indicator lamp 4 6d is turned off,  when the intake air<br>
temperature TA satisfies a relationship Ti<ta the indicator lamp is flickered and when it determined that intake></ta>
air temperature TA is T1  or below, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on. Further, in the constitutional example which uses the LED capable of emitting light in plural colors as the indicator lamp 4 6d, when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T0, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on in green, when the intake air<br>
temperature TA satisfies a relationship Ti<ta the indicator lamp is turned on in yellow and when it determined that></ta>
the intake air temperature TA is Ti or below, the indicator lamp<br>
46d is turned on in red.<br>
[0033]<br>
Due to such a constitution, by turning off the indicator lamp 4 6d (by turning on the indicator lamp 46d in green in the<br><br>
constitutional example using the LED or the like capable of<br>
emitting light in plural colors) when the temperature at the<br>
time of turning on the main switch exceeds T0, a driver is<br>
informed of the fact that worsening of startability based on<br>
the environmental temperature is not expected.  Further, by<br>
flickering the indicator lamp 46d (by turning on the indicator<br>
lamp 4 6d in yellow in the above-mentioned constitutional<br>
example) when the temperature satisfies the relationship<br>
Ti<ta the driver is informed of fact that mixing ratio ethanol in fuel high and hence there exists></ta>
a possibility that it is difficult to start the engine 1.  Still<br>
further, by turning on the indicator lamp 46d (by turning on<br>
the  indicator lamp  4 6d in red  in the  above-mentioned<br>
constitutional example) when the temperature is T1 or below,<br>
the driver is informed of the fact that the worsening of<br>
startability is expected with the mixed fuel. Accordingly, the<br>
driver can further finely recognize whether the startability<br>
of the engine in the specific environment is in a good condition<br>
or a bad condition prior to starting the engine.<br>
[0034]<br>
Further, in a constitutional example which uses the<br>
information display device 55 as the starting display unit 35,<br>
the CPU 21 displays information which compares the temperature<br>
To read from the ROM 23 and the intake air temperature TA on<br>
the information display device 55.  For example, when an<br><br>
indicator-type meter shown in Fig. 6 is used as the information display device 55, a right side from a reference index 55b within an indication range of an indicator 55a is defined as a region H in which the favorable startability is expected, and a left side from the reference index 55b within the indication range of the indicator 55a is defined as a region C in which worsening of startability is expected, and the CPU 21 displays the goodness or the badness of the startability expected based on the intake air temperature TA which is detected by the TA sensor 13 in accordance with an indication position of the indicator 55a. [0035]<br>
To be more specific, when the intake air temperature TA detected by the TA sensor 13 is equal to the above-mentioned predetermined temperature To, the indicator 55a points out the reference index 55b/ when the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature To, the indicator 55a points out the region H on the right side of the reference index 55b, and when the intake air temperature TA is below the predetermined temperature To, the indicator 55a points out the region C on the left side of the reference index 55b. A swing (gain) of the indicator 55a with respect to the reference index 55b can be suitably determined. For example, the swing of the indicator 55a is set to establish a relationship in which the swing linearly corresponds to a temperature change in both left and<br><br>
right directions using the temperature T0 as the reference. Alternatively, in conformity with the relationship established between the environmental temperature and the starting injection time TICK shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to set a relationship in which swing amplitude in the right direction from the reference index 55b when the intake air temperature TA exceeds the temperature T0 is exponentially compressed with respect to a temperature change, and swing amplitude in the left direction from the reference index 55b when the intake air temperature TA becomes below the temperature T0 is increased in a quadratic manner with respect to a temperature change. Here, a bar meter which uses an LED or a liquid crystal display device can be also used as the information display device 55. For example, the bar meter which uses the LED may adopt an LED which emits lights in different colors on left and right sides of the reference index using the temperature T0 as the reference or may be configured to continuously change color using the temperature To as the reference. [0036]<br>
According to the starting information display device which uses such an information display device 55, the temperature at the time of turning on the main switch is equal to the temperature T0 which becomes the reference for determining the startability, the indicator 55a points out the reference index  55b.  When the temperature  exceeds the<br><br>
temperature T0, the indicator 55a points out the region H on the right side of the reference index 55b, and when the temperature is below the temperature T0, the indicator 55a is positioned in the region C on the left side of the reference index 55b. Further, in both of the region H in which the favorable startability is expected and the region C in which worsening of startability is expected, the degree of goodness or the degree of badness is indicated. Accordingly, the driver can recognize the goodness or the badness of the startability of the engine under the specific environment and the degree of goodness or badness in an instinct manner and in detail prior to starting of the engine by merely glancing at the information display device 55. [0037]<br>
Due to such a constitution, according to the starting information display device of the first embodiment which has been explained heretofore, the influence asserted on the startability of the engine 1 based on the change of the environmental temperature is displayed on the starting display unit 35 and hence, the driver can recognize the goodness or the badness of the startability of the engine in the specific environment prior to starting of the engine whereby it is possible to provide a vehicle having the starting information display device with simple and inexpensive constitution which is constituted of the temperature detector 13 which detects the<br><br>
temperature of the intake air or the outside air, the ECU 20 and the starting display unit 35 and having the easy-to-drive property. Here, in the embodiment, the explanation is madewith respect to the constitutional example in which the ECU 20 which controls the operation of the engine controls the display of the starting display unit 35. However, the display control may be performed by a control device different from the ECU 20. [0038] (Starting information display device of second embodiment)<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, as the general characteristic on the startability of the engine, the startability of the engine based on the relationship between the environmental temperature and the starting injection time TICK has been explained. However, the starting injection time TICK differs between the starting in a state that the temperature of the engine 1 is substantially equal to the environmental temperature (cold starting) and the re-starting in a warm-up state in which the engine 1 is warmed (hot starting) . This difference is considered to be attributed to a fact that when the engine is in a warm-up state, the intake air and the fuel are warmed in intake and compression strokes, and the fuel adhered to an inner wall of a cylinder and a piston is vaporized to facilitate the ignition. Accordingly, in the hot starting which is performed in a state that the engine 1 is warmed, the startability of the engine is hardly worsened during an<br><br>
approximately fixed injection time until the environmental temperature becomes the temperature lower than the environmental temperature of the cold starting. That is, in the hot starting, the temperature To which has a possibility of influencing the startability of the engine is changed to the temperature lower than the corresponding temperature in the above-mentioned cold starting. [0039]<br>
Here, as an index for determining a warm-up state of the engine 1, for example, when the engine 1 is a water-cooled engine, a detection value (water temperature TW) of the TW sensor 15 for detecting a temperature of cooling water is exemplified as a typical example, while when the engine 1 is an air-cooled engine, a detection value (engine temperature) of an engine temperature detection sensor for detecting a temperature of a cylinder block is exemplified as a typical example. However, a temperature of other part of the engine 1, for example, a detection value (lubrication oil temperature) of an oil temperature detection sensor which detects a temperature of a lubrication oil in the inside of the engine 1 can be also used as the index for determining a warm-up state of the engine 1. To obtain a relationship between the water temperature of the cooling water in the water-cooled engine and the preferable starting injection time in a warm-up state corresponding to the water temperature, the correspondence relationship between the<br><br>
water temperature TW and the starting injection time TICR can be obtained as shown in Fig, 7Abased on a result of an experiment and the like. [0040]<br>
As can be clearly understood from Fig. 7A, when the engine 1 is warmed and the water temperature TW exceeds the predetermined water temperature T3, the favorable startability can be ensured for an approximately fixed short injection time in the same manner as the case shown in Fig. 5 in which the intake air temperature exceeds the temperature To. However, when the water temperature TW becomes below the predetermined temperature T3, a warm-up effect of the engine is not obtained and hence, when the starting injection time TIGR is short, there exists a possibility that the startability is worsened in a state that the mixing ratio of ethanol in the mixed fuel is high. [0041]<br>
Fig. 7B shows the relationship between the cooling water temperature TW and the intake air temperature TA from a viewpoint whether the favorable startability can be ensured or not with the fixed starting injection time TICR. A portion of the graph above a characteristic curve Do defines a region in which the favorable startability is expected with the approximately fixed injection time, and a portion of the graph below the characteristic curve Dc defines a region in which it is difficult to ensure the favorable startability with the fixed<br><br>
injection time and hence, worsening of startability is expected. As shown in the drawing, in a state that the water temperature TW exceeds the predetermined temperature T3, due to the warm-up effect of the engine, even when the intake air temperature TA becomes lower than the temperature T0 within a fixed range, the favorable startability can be obtained corresponding to the water temperature (warm-up state of the engine) .  On the other hand, in a state that the water temperature TW becomes lower than the predetermined temperature T3/ the warm-up effect of the engine cannot be obtained and hence, as mentioned previously, the goodness or the badness of startability is determined based on whether the intake air temperature TA exceeds the temperature To or not. [0042]<br>
Accordingly, in the starting information display device of the second embodiment, a startability determination table based on the water temperature TW and the intake air temperature TA shown in Fig. 7B is preliminarily set and stored in the ROM 23. When the main switch is turned on, the CPU 21 reads the startability determination table from the ROM 23 and, at the same time, a detection value of the water temperature TW inputted from the TW sensor 15 and a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13 are filled in the table so as to determine the goodness or the badness of the startability, and a result of the determination is displayed<br><br>
on the starting display unit 35. [0043]<br>
To be more specific, the CPU 21 fills the intake air temperature TA detected by the TA sensor 13 and the water temperature TW detected by the TW sensor in the table, determines the goodness or the badness of the startability based on whether the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and water temperature TW is positioned above or below the characteristic curve Dc, and displays the result of the determination on the starting display unit 35. [0044]<br>
For example, in the starting information display device having the constitution which uses the indicator lamp 46d as the starting display unit 35, when the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and the present water temperature TW is expressed as P1 shown in Fig. 7B, P1 is positioned above the characteristic curve Dc and hence, it is determined that the startability is favorable and the indicator lamp 46d is not turned on. That is, in this combination, although the intake air temperature TA is below the temperature T0, the favorable startability is expected due to the warm-up effect of the engine and hence, a turn-off state of the indicator lamp 46d is maintained. Further, when the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and water temperature TW is expressed as Pz shown in the drawing (or the combination being<br><br>
positioned on the characteristic curve) , P2 is positioned below the characteristic curve Dc and hence, it is determined that startability is not favorable and the indicator lamp 46d is turned on. In this combination^ although the water temperature TW exceeds the temperature T3, the intake air temperature TA becomes largely below the temperature To and hence, it is expected that the acquisition of the favorable startability is difficult only with the warm-up effect of the engine and the indicator lamp 46d is turned on. On the other hand, when the water temperature TW is equal to or below the temperature T3, the warm-up effect of the engine cannot be obtained and hence, the goodness or the badness of the startability is determined based on whether the intake air temperature TA exceeds the temperature To or not, and a display control substantially equal to the above-mentioned display control of the starting information display device of the first einbodiment is executed. Here, the starting information display device which uses an LED capable of emitting light in plural colors and changing over emitting color corresponding to the goodness or the badness of the startability can be also configured in the same manner. [0045]<br>
According to the starting information display device having such a constitution, when the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW at the time of turning on  the main  switch  is  positioned  above  the<br><br>
characteristic curve Dc which becomes the reference for determining the goodness or the badness of the startability set by taking the warm-up state of the engine into consideration, the indicator lamp 4 6d is turned off so that the driver is informed of the fact that the worsening of startability based on the environmental condition is not expected. On the other hand, when the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW at the time of turning on the main switch is positioned on the characteristic curve Dc or below the characteristic curve Dc, the indicator lamp 46d is turned on and the driver is informed of the fact that there exists a possibility that it is difficult to start the engine 1 when the mixing ratio of ethanol in the fuel is high. Accordingly, the driver can recognize the goodness or the badness of the startability of the engine under the environmental condition including the warm-up state of the engine prior to the starting of the engine. [0046]<br>
Further, when the information display device 55 is used as the starting display unit 35, that is, for example, when an indicator-type meter shown in Fig, 6 is used as the starting display unit 35, the reference index 55b within an indication range of the indicator 55a is made to correspond to the characteristic curve Dc in Fig. 7B, a region H on the right side of the reference index 55b in which the favorable startability<br><br>
is expected is made to correspond to a region above the characteristic curve Dc in Fig. 7B, and a region C on the left side of the reference index 55b in which worsening of startability is expected is made to correspond to a region below the characteristic curve Dc in Fig. 7B. It is determined whether the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and the present water temperature TW is positioned above the characteristic curve Dc or below the characteristic curve Dc, and a result of the determination is displayed on the starting display unit 35. [0047]<br>
That is, when the combination of the intake air temperature TA detected by the TA sensor 13 and the water temperature TW detected by the TW sensor is positioned on the characteristic curve Dc in Fig. 7B, the indicator 55a points out the reference index 55b. When the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW is positioned above the characteristic curve Dc (for example, the combination is positioned at Pi in the drawing) , the indicator 55a points out the region H on the right side of the reference index 55b. Further, the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW is positioned below the characteristic curve Dc (for example, the combination is positioned at P2 in the drawing) , the indicator 55a points out the region C on the left side of the reference index 55b.<br><br>
In the same manner as the above-mentioned embodiment, the swing (gain) of the indicator 55a with respect to the reference index 55b can be suitably set. For example, using the characteristic curve Dc as the reference, the swing of the indicator 55a is set such that a linear correspondence relationship in both right and left directions is established with respect to a distance from the characteristic curve Dc to the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and water temperature TW (for example, the above-mentioned P1 or P2) . Alternatively, an amount of upward or downward shifting by which the intake air temperature TA overlaps the characteristic curve Dc under the present water temperature TW (warm-up state) is established as a linear correspondence relationship with respect to the intake air temperature TA. Further, the swing amplitude of the indicator 55a in the right direction from the reference index 55b when the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and water temperature TW is positioned above the characteristic curve Dc (for example, when the combination is positioned at P1) can be exponentially compressed with respect to a temperature change of the intake air temperature TA, while the swing amplitude of the indicator 55a in the left direction from the reference index 55b when the combination of the present intake air temperature TA and water temperature TW is positioned below the characteristic curve Dc<br><br>
(for example, when the combination is positioned at P2) can be set as a correspondence relationship which is increased in a quadratic manner with respect to a temperature change of the intake air temperature TA. Here, the above-mentioned constitution is also applicable to a case in which a bar meter which uses an LED or a liquid crystal display device is used as the information display device 55. [0049]<br>
According to the starting information display device which uses such an information display device 55, when the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW at the time of turning on the main switch is equal to the characteristic curve Dc which becomes the reference for determining the goodness or the badness of the startability set by taking the warm-up state of the engine into consideration, the indicator 55a points out the reference index 55b. When the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW is positioned above the characteristic curve Dc, the indicator 55a points out the region H on the right side of the reference index 55b. Further, when the combination of the intake air temperature TA and the water temperature TW is positioned below the characteristic curve Dc, the indicator 55a points out the region C on the left side of the reference index 55b. Further, in both of the region H in which the favorable startability is expected and the region C in which worsening<br><br>
of startability is expected, the degree of goodness and the degree of badness are indicated. Accordingly, the driver can recognize the goodness or the badness of the startability of the engine under the environmental condition including the warm-up state of the engine and the degree of goodness or badness in an instinct manner and in detail prior to the starting of the engine by merely glancing the information display device 55. [0050]<br>
According to the starting information display device of the second embodiment explained above, the influence of the environmental condition including the warm-up state of the engine which is asserted on the startability is displayed on the starting display unit 35.  Due to such a constitution, the determination on the goodness or the badness of the startability is correlated with the warm-up state of the engine and hence, even when the intake air temperature changes, the information on the startability can be displayed on the starting display unit 35 in a stable manner and, at the same time, the starting information can be displayed with startability close to the actual startability when the engine is restarted in an engine warmed-up state, [0051] (Starting information display device of third embodiment)<br>
Next, the explanation is made with respect to a starting<br><br>
information display device which estimates a mixing ratio of ethanol based on the concentration of oxygen contained in the exhaust gas from an engine, and displays information on influence which is asserted on the startability based on an environmental condition in response to the estimated mixing ratio. [0052]<br>
First of all, the explanation is made with respect to the calculation of a fuel injection time during a usual operation and an estimation method of the mixing ratio of ethanol. At the time of performing the usual operation, by referencing the Pb/Ne map or the Ne/TH map which is preliminarily obtained based on experimental results or the like, the CPU 21 obtains the intake air quantity under various conditions, and calculates the basic fuel injection time (TIM) based on the obtained intake air quantity and the preset target air/fuel ratio. Fig. 8A is a view showing an example of the Pb/Ne map and Fig. 8B is a view showing an example of the Ne/TH map. [0053]<br>
The Pb/Ne map is a map which is used for an estimation system of intake oxygen quantity which is referred to as a speed concentration system adopted at the time of performing a low-load operation such as a warm-up of the engine. Using this map, the intake air quantity is obtained based on an intake pressure Pb and the engine rotational speed (Ne) . As shown in<br><br>
Fig. 8A, no fixed correlation is established between the intake pressure Pb and the engine rotational speed Ne and hence, the intake air quantity is identified using the map as an isotropic air quantity diagram. [0054]<br>
On the other hand, the Ne/TH map is a map which is used for an estimation system of an intake oxygen quantity which is referred to as a throttle speed system adopted at the time of performing a high-load operation of the engine . Using this map, the intake air quantity is obtained based on the engine rotational speed Ne and the throttle opening TH. As shown in Fig. 8B, also in the Ne/TH map, in the same manner as the Pb/Ne map, no fixed correlation is established between the Ne and the TH and hence, the intake air quantity is identified using the map as an isotropic air quantity diagram. [0055]<br>
When a basic fuel injection time TIM is calculated based on the intake air quantity which is obtained from the Pb/Ne map or the Ne/TH map, as a next step, it is necessary to correct the basic fuel injection time TIM based on difference in environmental conditions between an experimental state and an actual operation state of the engine 1. Fig. 9 is a graph showing an example of a correction coefficient table for obtaining an intake air temperature correction coefficient (KTA) corresponding to an intake air temperature TA which is<br><br>
obtained by the TA sensor 13 for measuring the intake air temperature. As other correction coefficients, correction coefficients based on detection values which are obtained by the TH sensor 11, the TW sensor 15, the CRK sensor 16 and the 02 sensor 17 are present. To be more specific, the correction coefficients such as a post-starting increased quantity correction coefficient (KAST), a water temperature correction coefficient (KTW) , an acceleration correction coefficient (TACC), an asynchronicity correction coefficient (OPINJ) and an ignition timing coefficient are named- The correction coefficient table is provided for every correction coefficient, and a fuel injection time (Tout) which allows the injection of fuel by the injector 5 is calculated based on the above-mentioned basic fuel injection time TIM and these plurality of correction coefficients. [0056]<br>
Alcohol fuel such as ethanol contains an oxygen atom 0 in the composition thereof and hence, an oxygen quantity necessary for the combustion per unit volume becomes small compared to a case in which gasoline is burnt. Accordingly, when the mixed fuel which is produced by mixing ethanol and gasoline is used, a theoretical air/fuel ratio becomes small compared to a case in which a single fuel made of only gasoline is used. Accordingly, to operate the engine 1 in an optimum state, it is necessary to set the Pb/Ne map, the Ne/TH map and<br><br>
various correction coefficient tables for respective mixing<br>
ratios of ethanol and gasoline.<br>
[0057]<br>
Here, it has been known from experimental results or the like that in a state that the ethanol concentration exhibits a certain value, even when the map and the table for operating the engine 1 in an optimum state are applied to ethanol of other concentration which falls within a fixed range, it is possible to perform a control of the substantially same level as a control which is performed in a case in which proper map and table are applied for the other concentration. Accordingly, in the engine control system, a range of concentration shown in Fig. 10 is set, and as reference concentrations of ethanol in respective ranges, four kinds of concentrations consisting of 22% of ethanol (E22), 50% of ethanol (E50) , 80% of ethanol (E80) and 100% of ethanol (ElOO) are preliminarily obtained, and the Pb/Ne maps, the Ne/TH maps and various correction coefficient tables are formed for the respective ethanol concentrations. Here, it is sufficient to provide three or more reference concentrations, and the reference concentrations may be properly allocated with reference to any concentrations from 0% to 100%. The respective maps and tables are set such that the maps and tables possess ranges where the map and table overlap each other as concentrations shown in Fig. 10. [0058]<br><br>
In the ROM 23, the Pb/Ne maps, the Ne/TH maps, the various correction coefficient tables and the like which are prepared for the respective reference concentrations of ethanol are preliminarily set and stored as a set of maps (hereinafter described as the reference fuel injection maps) . Here, in the explanation made hereinafter, the reference fuel injection maps for the respective reference concentrations are respectively described as an E22% map, an E50% map, an E80% map and an E100% map. [0059]<br>
Next, the explanation is made with respect to the estimation method of the ethanol concentration based on the changeover method of the E22% map, the E50% map, the E80% map and the E100% map in the control program of the CPU 21. As shown in Fig. 11 which is a conceptual view of map changeover processing, the CPU 21 executes the map changeover processing by referencing a required injection quantity magnification (K02) in which the control program calculates from a detection signal (V02) indicative of the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas in which the 02 sensor 17 detects or an average learnt value (K02REF) of the required inj ection quantity magnification K02. The required injection quantity magnification K02 exhibits a large value when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is high and exhibits a small value when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is low.<br><br>
[0060]<br>
Here, when the required injection quantity magnification K02 or the K02REF which is the average learnt value of the required injection quantity magnification K02 exhibits a large value (when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is high), this implies the state in which the injection quantity from the injector 5 is small (lean state), and the engine is operated with the small fuel injection quantity. Due to such an operation, it is determined that the ethanol concentration in the mixed fuel is higher than the ethanol concentration of the reference injection fuel map set at present and hence, the processing for changing over the map to the map which exhibits the high ethanol concentration is performed. For example, in using the E50% map as the present reference injection fuel map, when the value of K02REF is large, it is determined that the concentration of ethanol in the mixed fuel is higher than 50% of ethanol, and the reference fuel injection map is changed over to the E80% map corresponding to 80% of ethanol. [0061]<br>
On the other hand, when the K02 or the K02REF exhibits a small value (when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is low) , this implies a state in which the injection quantity from the injector 5 is large (rich state), and the engine is operated with the excessive fuel injection quantity. Due to such an operation, it is determined that the concentration of<br><br>
ethanol in the mixed fuel is lower than the ethanol concentration of the reference injection fuel map set at present and hence, the processing for changing over the maps to the map which exhibits the low ethanol concentration is performed. For example, in using the E50% map as the present reference injection fuel map, when the value of K02REF is small, it is determined that the concentration of ethanol in the mixed fuel is lower than 50%, and the reference injection fuel map is changed over to the E22% map corresponding to 22% of ethanol. [0062]<br>
In this manner, the concentration of ethanol can be estimated based on the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas detected by the 02 sensor 17, and the map corresponding to the reference concentration of the estimated ethanol is selected and is stored in the EEP-ROM 24. [0063]<br>
As can be understood from Fig. 5 which is the view showing the relationship between the environmental temperature and the starting injection time, the predetermined temperature To shown in the drawing is changed corresponding to the concentration of ethanol in the mixed fuel, wherein the lower the mixing ratio of ethanol (the higher the mixing ratio of gasoline) , the lower the predetermined temperature To becomes. To explain this relationship corresponding to the reference ethanol concentration, assuming the predetermined temperature when<br><br>
ethanol concentration is 100% as T0IA the predetermined temperature when the ethanol concentration is 80% as T02, the predetermined temperature when the ethanol concentration is 50% as T03, and the predetermined temperature when the ethanol concentration is 22% as T0,, a relationship Toi<to2 is established chained lines in fig. when the environmental temperature at time of starting engine becomes lower than above-mentioned predetermined temperatures corresponding to respective ethanol concentrations worsening startability expected during a substantially fixed injection time.></to2>
Accordingly, in the starting information display device of this embodiment, the predetermined temperatures T01, T02, T03, T04 which require setting of the starting injection time TICK corresponding to the environmental temperatures are preliminarily stored in the ROM 23 corresponding to four kinds of ethanol reference concentrations. When the main switch is turned on, the CPU 21 reads the ethanol concentration from the EEP-ROM 24 and, at the same time, the above-mentioned predetermined temperature corresponding to the ethanol concentration is read from the ROM 23 . Then, the CPU 21 compares the predetermined temperature read from the ROM 23 with a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13, and displays the influence asserted on the<br><br>
startability based on a result of the comparison on the starting<br>
display unit 35.<br>
[0065]<br>
For example, in a state that the mixing ratio of the fuel recorded in the EEP-ROM 24 is ethanol 50% by the estimation setting of the ethanol concentration, the CPU 21, when the main switch is turned on, reads that the concentration of ethanol in the fuel is 50% from the EEP-ROM 24, and reads the predetermined temperature T03 corresponding to ethanol 50% from the ROM 23. Then, the CPU 21 compares the read predetermined temperature T03 with a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13. When the CPU 21 determines that the intake air temperature TA is equal to or below the predetermined temperature T03 so that the worsening of startability is expected, the CPU 21 turns on the indicator lamp 4 6d, while when it is determined that the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T03 and the worsening of startability is not expected, the CUP 21 turns off the indicator lamp 46d. The starting information display device which uses an LED capable of emitting light in plural colors and capable of changing over light emission colors can be also configured in the above-mentioned manner. [0066]<br>
Further, in a constitutional example which uses the information display device 55 as the starting display unit 35,<br><br>
when the intake air temperature TA is equal to the predetermined temperature T03, the indicator 55a points out the reference index 55b. When the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T03/ the indicator 55a points out the right-side display region H. Further, when the intake air temperature TA is below the predetermined temperature T03, the indicator 55a points out the left-side display region C. Further, a swing of the indicator 55a with respect to the reference index 55b can be suitably set as described previously. Still further, this constitutional example is also applicable to a starting information display device adopting a bar meter which uses an LED or a liquid crystal display device in the same manner. [0067]<br>
When the mixing ratio of ethanol is changed due to the supply of the fuel, for example, when the ethanol concentration is lowered to approximately 20% due to the supply of gasoline, the reference fuel injection map at the time of performing the usual operation is changed over from the E50% map to the E22% map due to the above-mentioned map changing processing, and the E22% map is recorded in the EEP-ROM 24. Accordingly, at the time of starting the engine next time, the predetermined temperature T04 corresponding to ethanol 22% is read from the ROM 23, the predetermined temperature T04 is compared with a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from<br><br>
the TA sensor 13, and a result of the comparison is displayed<br>
on the starting display unit 35,<br>
[0068]<br>
According to such a starting information display device, the determination of goodness or badness of startability corresponding to the mixing ratio of the fuel can be performed and the result of the determination can be displayed and hence, the more proper information on the startability of the engine can be transmitted to a driver prior to starting of the engine. Further, the starting information display device is also applicable to a vehicle having difficulty in mounting a plurality of fuel tanks, a plurality of control valves and the like thereon. Still further, it is unnecessary to mount a ethanol concentration sensor on the fuel tank and hence, a vehicle can be manufactured at a low cost. [0069]<br>
Heretofore, the explanation has been made with respect to the starting information display device having the constitution which estimates the concentration of ethanol in the fuel based on the detection value of the 02 sensor 17 and sets the predetermined temperature corresponding to the ethanol concentration as the reference for determining the startability However, the starting information display device may be configured such that the starting information display device includes an ethanol concentration setting means (for example.<br><br>
ethanol concentration selection switch which selects and sets either one of ethanol concentration of E22%, E50%, E80% and E100%) with which a driver sets the ethanol concentration, and when the main switch is turned on, the CPU 21 references the setting in the ethanol concentration setting means, reads the predetermined temperature (T01, T02,  T03, Tn4) corresponding to the ethanol concentration set by the driver from the ROM 23, and allows the starting display unit 35 to perform a display based on  a  comparison between the  read predetermined temperature and a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13. Due to such a constitution, the starting information display device can determine the startability corresponding to the ethanol concentration with the simple constitution and, at the same time, the driver can recognize the degree of influence brought about by the concentration of ethanol in the mixed fuel by changing over the setting of ethanol. [0070] (Starting information display device of fourth embodiment)<br>
Heretofore, the explanation has been made with respect to the starting information display device having the constitution which displays the information whether worsening of startability is expected or not based on the environmental condition when the starting injection time TICR is set to the approximately fixed value. Next, the explanation is made with<br><br>
respect to a case in which the present invention is applied to a vehicle having an engine control system which controls an operation of the engine 1 with an injection quantity suitable for an environmental condition by changing the starting injection time TICR corresponding to a change of the environmental condition. [0071]<br>
In this engine control system, at the time of performing the usual operation, the CPU 21 calculates a basic fuel injection time TIM by referencing a Pb/Ne map or an Ne/TH map corresponding to an ethanol concentration which is estimated based on the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas and is stored in the EEP-ROM 24, and calculates a fuel injection time Tout for actually allowing the injector 5 to inject the fuel based on a correction coefficient table stored in the ROM 23 such as an intake air temperature correction coefficient KTA, a post-starting increased quantity correction coefficient KAST, a water temperature correction coefficient KTW, an acceleration correction coefficient TACC, an asynchronicity correction coefficient OPINJ or an ignition timing coefficient. [0072]<br>
Further, also with respect to the starting injection time, as shown in Fig. 12A, even when the water temperature TW is set to a fixed value, the favorable injection time differs for every ethanol concentration. Accordingly, to maintain the favorable<br><br>
startability, it is desirable to set the injection time such that the excessive fuel injection is prevented when the ethanol concentration is at a lower-limit, and the maximum injection can be performed when the ethanol concentration is at an upper-limit. Accordingly, also in setting the starting injection time TICR, a range of concentration is set as shown in Fig. 12B, and by setting 22% (E22) of ethanol, 50% (E50) of ethanol, 80% (E80) of ethanol, 100% (E100) of ethanol as reference concentrations, a starting injection table indicative of a correspondence relationship between the water temperature TW shown in Fig. 7A and the starting injection time TICK is stored in the ROM 23 as four starting injection tables corresponding to the respective reference concentrations. Further, in the starting injection tables, the correspondence<br>
is made among an increment width Ati of the starting injection time, the number of repetition N indicative of times which<br>
become the reference for increasing the injection time in response to the number of injections, and an upper limit value Tmax of the starting injection time as preset constants. Values of these constants are also preliminarily stored in the ROM 23. Hereinafter, the information which includes the starting injection tables and constants thereof is described as starting injection information. [0073]<br>
In the ROM 23, as shown in Fig. 13, the Pb/Ne maps, the<br><br>
Ne/TH maps, the various correction coefficient tables and the starting injection information which are prepared for respective reference concentrations of ethanol are respectively prestored as a set of maps (the reference fuel injection maps) . Further, these reference fuel injection maps are referred to as a map set or a predetermined set. By storing the map sets, it is possible to perform the control of the engine<br>
1	in the whole range of ethanol concentrations using four sets<br>
of reference fuel injection maps . Further, by representing the<br>
ethanol content which is continuously changeable from 0% to 100%<br>
as the values of four kinds of the reference concentrations of<br>
ethanol using four sets of reference fuel injection maps, the<br>
correction of the proper reference concentration based on the<br>
reference fuel injection maps can be decreased thus stabilizing<br>
the operation state.<br>
[0074]<br>
In changing over the E22% map, the E50% map, the E80% map and the E100% map during the usual operation, as already explained in conjunction with Fig. 11, the map changeover operation is performed by referencing the required injection quantity magnification K02 which the control program of the CPU 21 calculates based on the detection signal V02 indicative of the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas detected by the<br>
02	sensor 17 or the average learnt value K02REF of the required<br>
injection quantity magnification K02.<br><br>
Fig. 14 is a flowchart showing the processing for changing over the reference fuel injection quantity maps in the control program of the CPU 21 at the time of performing the usual operation. The reference fuel injection quantity map changeover processing in this flowchart is repeatedly called and executed in steps of the control processing at the time of performing the usual operation. First of all, in step Sal, an engine rotational speed Ne is calculated based on a detection value obtained by the CRK sensor 16, it is determined whether the calculated engine rotational speed Ne and the throttle opening TH obtained by the TH sensor 11 are present within a K02REF calculation region shown in Fig. 15 or not. When it is determined that the engine rotational speed Ne and the throttle opening TH are present outside the K02REF calculation region, the changeover of the reference fuel injection map is not performed and the processing is finished. On the other hand, when it is determined that the engine rotational speed Ne and the throttle opening TH are present within the K02REF calculation region, the processing advances to step Sa2, wherein it is determined whether the engine 1 is in a warm-up state or not based on cooling water temperature TW and the intake air temperature TA which are detected by the TW sensor 15 and the TA sensor 13. Then, when it is determined that the engine 1 is not in a warm-up state, the changeover of the reference<br><br>
fuel injection map is not performed and the processing is finished, while when it is determined that the engine 1 is in a warm-up state, the processing advances to step Sa3, wherein the K02REF is updated, that is, the average learning is performed based on the value of the K02 obtained based on the oxygen concentration newly detected by the 02 sensor 17 thus calculating the K02REF, and the calculated value is updated as new K02REF. [0076]<br>
Next, in step Sa4, it is determined whether the updated K02REF falls within a range of a threshold value in the present ethanol concentration or not. Here, the threshold value at the reference concentration is constituted of an upper-limit threshold value and a lower-limit threshold value which are set for every reference concentration shown in Fig. 16, and the threshold values are set with an adjustment such that respective maps overlap each other. For example, as shown in Fig. 16, in the case of the E22% map, the lower-limit threshold value is 0 and the upper-limit threshold value is 1.1 â€¢ In the same manner, in the case of the E50% map, the lower-limit threshold value is 0.85 and the upper-limit threshold value is 1.08, and in the case of the E80% map, the lower-limit threshold value is 0.85 and the upper-limit threshold value is 1.1, In the case of the E100% map, only the lower-limit threshold value is set and the value is 0.8.  For example, in a state that the present reference<br><br>
concentration is E50%, when a value of the calculated K02REF falls within a range from 0.85 to 1.08, it is determined that the calculated K02REF falls within the threshold range and the changeover of the map is not performed. On the other hand, when the calculated K02REF assumes a value of less than 0.85, the changeover to the E22% map is performed, while when the K02REF assumes a value which exceeds 1,08, the changeover to the E80% map is performed (step Sa5). [0077]<br>
Even after the map changeover operation is performed, for example, even after the map is changed over from the E50% map to the E80% map, the map changeover processing shown in Fig. 14 is repeatedly called and executed.  In this case, however, corresponding to the changeover of the reference fuel injection map to the E80% map, the injection time is changed (increased) and hence, the oxygen concentration measured by the 02 sensor 17 is changed (lowered) whereby the value of the required injection quantity magnification K02 is changed in the decreasing direction and the value of the average leant value K02REF assumes a value close to 1.0 by average learning thus making the average leant value K02REF stable in the E80% map. [0078]<br>
Due to such reference fuel injection map changeover processing, the map of the reference concentration corresponding to the ethanol concentration is selected and<br><br>
hence, even when the ethanol concentration is changed during the usual operation, it is possible to operate the engine 1 in an optimum state. Here, in the reference fuel injection quantity map changeover processing explained in conjunction with Fig. 14, the explanation has been made with respect to the processing which uses the average learnt value K02REF as the reference. However, the starting information display device may be configured to perform the processing shown in Fig. 14 by applying the required injection quantity magnification K02 calculated based on the oxygen concentration detected by the 02 sensor 17 in place of the average learnt value K02REF. [0079]<br>
Next, in conjunction with Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, the explanation is made with respect to a starting control of the engine when the engine 1 is operated again after being stopped. Here, Fig. 17 shows a flowchart indicative of processing of the starting control, and Fig. 18 is a view showing a change of the starting injection time TICK in the starting control processing. [0080]<br>
With respect to the starting control, first of all, in step Sbl, during the usual operation, the CPU 21 calculates the ethanol concentration based on the oxygen concentration detected by the 02 sensor 17, and performs the average learning on the calculated ethanol concentration thus calculating an<br><br>
ethanol concentration learnt value. [0081]<br>
Next, in step Sb2, the reference concentration is obtained by comparing the ethanol concentration learnt value calculated in step Sbl and the range of the ethanol concentration shown in Fig. 10 and, as a predetermined set to be stored in the EEP-ROM 24 based on the obtained reference concentration, any one of the E22% map, the E50% map, the E80% map and the El00% map which constitute the reference fuel injection quantity maps is selected, and the selected predetermined set and the reference concentration are stored in the EEP-ROM 24 (step Sb3) . Thereafter, a main switch (amain SW) is turned off thus stopping the supply of electricity to the ECU 20 from the battery (step Sb4), and the operation of the vehicle is stopped. Here, although the information stored in the RAM 22 is erased, the information stored in the ROM 23 and the information stored in the EEP-ROM are held without being erased. [0082]<br>
Prior to the starting of the engine 1, the main switch SW is turned on and, when the supply of electricity to the ECU 20 from the battery is started, the control program of the starting control is started in the CPU 21. When the control program is started, the CPU 21 calls the predetermined set held and stored in the EEP-ROM 24 in step Sb5, and the CPU 21 reads<br><br>
the starting injection information from the called predetermined set. Then, the processing advances to step Sb6 in which the CPU 21 obtains an initial value of the starting injection time TICR based on the starting injection table contained in the starting injection information, the intake air temperature TA which is inputted from the TA sensor 13 and the water temperature TW of the cooling water which is inputted from the TW sensor 15. Further, the CPU 21 also reads an increment<br>
width Ati, the number of repetition N and the starting injection time upper limit value Tmax contained in the starting injection information, and performs setting of the respective information in the control program. Thereafter, a variable of the starting injection number n is reset to 0, and the processing advances to step Sb7. [0083]<br>
In step Sb7, the CPU21 determines whether the operation on the engine is during cranking or not. Then, when it is determined that the operation of the engine is not during cranking, until the cranking is started, the determination is continued. When it is determined that the operation of the engine is during cranking, a value which is obtained by adding 1 to the starting injection number n substitutes the starting injection number n in step Sb8, and the processing advances to step Sb9. For example, during the initial cranking, 1 is added to the starting injection number n which is reset to 0 in step<br><br>
Sb6 such that n=l substitutes the starting injection number and the processing advances to step Sb9. In step Sb9, it is determined whether the starting injection time TICK is less than the starting injection time upper limit value Tmax or not. When it is determined that the starting injection time TICR is less than the starting injection time upper limit value Tmax, the processing advances to step SblO which determines whether the starting injection number n is equal to the number of repetition N or not. When it is determined that the starting injection number n is equal to the number of repetition N (the starting injection being performed by the predetermined number of repetition N) in step SblO, a value which is obtained by adding<br>
the increment width Ati to the present starting injection time TICR substitutes the TICR in step Sbll, the starting injection number n is reset to 0 in step Sbl2, and the processing advances to step Sbl3. [0084]<br>
In step Sbl3, it is determined whether the starting is finished or not based on whether the present engine rotational speed Ne exceeds the predetermined rotational speed A or not in response to a detection signal from the CRK sensor. Here, when it is determined that the present engine rotational speed Ne exceeds the predetermined rotational speed A and the starting is finished, since the usual operation is already started, the processing advances to step Sbl4, and the processing from step<br><br>
Sbl to step Sb3 is repeatedly performed until the main switch SW is turned off while performing the injection control, that iS, while performing the processing shown in Fig. 14, at the time of performing the usual operation. On the other hand, when it is determined that the present engine rotational speed Ne is equal to or less than the predetermined rotational speed A and the engine is during the starting yet, the processing returns to step Sb7 for continuing the starting control. [0085]<br>
Further, in step SbB, when it is determined that the starting injection time TICR is not less than the starting injection time upper limit value Tmax, that is, when it is determined that the starting injection time TICR arrives at the injection time upper limit value Tmax, and in step SblO, when it is determined that the starting injection number n is not equal to the number of repetition N, that is, when it is determined that the starting injection does not arrive at the number of repetition, the processing advances to step Sbl3 in which the CPU 21 performs the determination of finishing of starting while maintaining the present starting injection time TICR and the present starting injection number n. [0086]<br>
Fig. 18 is a view showing a change of the starting injection time TICR when the number of repetition N is set to 4 .  The starting injection time TICR is increased in a step-li]ce<br><br>
manner by an increment width Ati for every four injections with the same starting injection time, and after a starting injection<br>
time TICR arrives at a starting injection time upper limit value Tmax, cranking is continued in a state that the starting injection time TCIR is maintained at the upper limit value. Here, the minimum value of the starting injection time TICR is the minimum required injection quantity (lower-limit concentration required injection quantity) at the ethanol reference concentration set by the predetermined set, and the maximum value of the starting injection time TICR is set to be the maximum required injection quantity (upper-limit concentration required injection quantity) at the ethanol concentration (see Fig. 12B). [0087]<br>
Due to such processing, even when ethanol or gasoline is refilled when the engine is stopped, the mixing ratio of the fuel remaining in the fuel pipe maintains the state before refilling. Accordingly, by performing the starting control using the reference fuel injection quantity map corresponding to the ethanol reference concentration at the time of performing the usual operation immediately before the main SW is turned off, it is possible to perform the rapid starting control in a proper state while obviating the covering of the plug with respect to the engine 1. Further, in the processing shown in Fig. 17, each time the starting injection number becomes the<br><br>
number of repetition N, the starting injection time TICR is<br>
increased by the increment width Ati. Accordingly, until the starting of the engine is finished, it is possible to perform the starting control by gradually increasing the fuel injection time, that is, by gradually increasing the fuel injection quantity injected from the injector 5. [0088]<br>
Here, in the processing shown in Fig. 11 ^ the constitution which selects any one of the E22% map, the E50% map, the E80% map and the El00% map which constitute the reference fuel injection quantity map and stores the selected maps in the EEP-ROM 24 is exemplified. However, the starting information display device may be configured such that only the ethanol concentration learnt value or the ethanol reference concentration is stored in the EEP-ROM 24 and the corresponding reference fuel injection quantity map is read from the ROM 23 based on the value read from the EEP-ROM 24 at the time of performing starting next time. Further, in the processing shown in Fig. 17, each time the starting injection number n arrives at the number of repetition N, the starting injection<br>
time TICR is increased by the increment width Ati. However, the starting injection time TICR may be increased by the<br>
increment width Ati each time a period in which the injection is performed exceeds a fixed time.<br><br>
In a vehicle having such an engine control system, the starting injection time TICK corresponding to the environmental condition (environmental temperature, ethanol concentration or the like) can be set and hence, the worsening of startability attributed to setting of the fuel injection time to the approximately fixed value can be obviated. [0090]<br>
However, as can be clearly understood from Fig. 5, Fig. 7 and other drawings, at the time of using the mixed fuel, in a state that the environmental temperature is equal to or below the predetermined temperature (T0,T3, T01, T02, T03, T04), a change quantity (ATICR) of the starting injection time with respect to the temperature change (AT) of the environmental temperature is increased, and the ethanol reference concentration set by estimation has a fixed concentration width and hence, there exists a possibility that an error occurs in an optimum starting injection time due to the difference between the set reference concentration and the actual ethanol concentration. Accordingly, when the environmental temperature becomes lower than the predetermined temperature (T01, T02, T03, T04) , there arises a case in which the engine starting condition is not always favorable in an initial stage of cranking (the startability of the engine being lowered). [0091]<br>
Accordingly, in the starting information display device<br><br>
of this embodiment, at the ethanol reference concentration set by estimation based on the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas, when the intake air temperature TA becomes lower than the predetermined temperatures (T01, T02, T03, T04) at the respective ethanol concentrations, or when the intake air temperature TA becomes lower than the predetermined temperature T3 which is determined by adding the warm-up state of the engine (water temperature TW) , the CPU 21 allows the starting display unit 35 to display information on the startability. [0092]<br>
To be more specific, the predetermined temperatures T01, T02, T03, T04 which require the setting of starting injection times TICR corresponding to the environmental temperatures are preliminarily stored in the ROM 23 corresponding to four kinds of ethanol reference concentrations. When the main switch is turned on, the CPU 21 reads the ethanol reference concentration from the EEP-ROM24 and, at the same time, reads the above-mentioned predetermined temperature corresponding to the ethanol reference concentration from the ROM 23, compares the read temperature with a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13 and a detection value of the water temperature TW inputted from the TW sensor 15, and displays the influence asserted on the startability based on a result of the comparison on the starting display unit 35.<br><br>
For example, when the predetermined set of E50% is stored in the EEP-ROM 24 based on the estimation of the ethanol concentration during the usual operation, the CUP 21, when the main switch is turned on, calls the predetermined set from the EEP-ROM 2 4 and, at the same time, reads the map on the predetermined temperature T03 and the water temperature correction coefficient which corresponds to ethanol 50% from the ROM 23. Then, the CPU 21 compares the read map with a detection value of the intake air temperature TA inputted from the TA sensor 13 and a detection value of the water temperature TW inputted from the TW sensor 15 to each other. When the intake air temperature TA which includes the water temperature correction coefficient KTW is set to the predetermined temperature T03 or below, the CPU 21 turns on the indicator lamp 4 6d, while when the intake air temperature TA exceeds the predetermined temperature T03, the CPU 21 turns off the indicator lamp 46d. Also when the information display device 55 is used as the starting display unit 35, the CPU 21 performs the substantially same control using the predetermined temperatures Toi, T02/ Tos^ T04 corresponding to the ethanol reference concentrations as references. [0094]<br>
Here, in the above-mentioned embodiments, four kinds of ethanol reference concentrations are set (E22%, E50%, E80%,<br><br>
E100%), and the predetermined temperatures (T01, T02, T03, T04) are set in four stages corresponding to four kinds of ethanol reference concentrations. However, the reference concentrations of ethanol and the predetermined temperatures may be set in further multiple stages or may be set as continuous numerical values, or alcohol concentration in the inside of a fuel passage may be displayed by directly detecting. [0095]<br>
According to the starting information display device of the fourth embodiment, the starting injection time TICK corresponding to the mixing ratio of the fuel and the environmental temperature can be set and hence, worsening of startability of the engine attributed to a change of the environmental condition can be suppressed and, at the same time, it is possible to inform the possibility of the fact that the engine starting condition is not always favorable (startability of the engine being lowered) at an initial stage of cranking attributed to a delicate change of the environmental condition to a driver prior to the starting of the engine. [0096]<br>
According to the starting information display devices of the respective embodiments explained heretofore, it is possible to provide the starting information display device which allows the driver to recognize the state that worsening of startability is expected prior to starting of the engine with the simple and<br><br>
inexpensive constitution.<br>
