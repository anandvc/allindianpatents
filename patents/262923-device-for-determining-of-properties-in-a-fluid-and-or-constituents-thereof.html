BACKGROUND<br>
The invention will occasionally be mentioned in the text as HBX Spectral analysis is a basic<br>
measuring method of properties - chemical or physical as well as others - in a fluid with substances<br>
as suspension and/or solution. Spectral photometry of light absorption in chosen ranges of wave<br>
lengths is a well established standard method for determination of substances in a fluid and/or the<br>
actual condition of the substances at the time of measurement. The present invention relates to the<br>
analysis of blood, especially human blood for medical purpose, even though the invention is<br>
suitable for other body fluids or other organic/non organic fluids with or without substances in<br>
suspension, where, the technical conditions makes the methodapplicable.Blood is commonly<br>
described as a complex red fluid consisting of one bright yellow part, plasma, and in the plasma a<br>
suspension of blood cells mainly red cells. In an adult the blood volume is approximately 5 litre, of<br>
which 40 - 50 % is red cells. The ratio between red cells and plasma is called hematocrit. Plasma<br>
consists of mainly water with proteins, sugar, vitamins, hormones enzymes etcetera. The blood cells<br>
are mainly divided in three groups, red cells erythrocytes, with a size significant of 0,007 mm and<br>
normally in an amount of 4 - 5 million/mm3 of whole blood. AN erythrocyte consists of a thin<br>
membrane as a kind of balloon in which there is water and a high concentration of the protein<br>
haemoglobin (Hb) in various forms, substances that can bind to and release oxygen and carbon<br>
dioxide in the circulation.<br>
Normally there is approx. 13-15 g haemoglobin per 100 ml blood in an adult, corresponding to 4 - 5<br>
million red cell. Even a very small sample of blood taken from one person is a representative amount<br>
of blood cells for making measurements to determine certain properties and conditions of the blood.<br>
The haemoglobin value is a measurement of the oxygen transportation capacity of the blood to<br>
other tissue and a parameter for patient diagnosis. Haemoglobin value is furthermore a primary<br>
safety and quality parameter in blood banking where blood is stored for transfusion purpose and<br>
collected as raw material for blood based industrial purposes.<br>
Many other substances e.g. glucose in plasma, is measured by use of photometry as Hb. In general<br>
measurement of volumes, activity and condition for substances in blood is a basic diagnostic aid for<br>
determination of a persons/patients medical condition.<br><br>
Haemoglobin (Hb) measurement is one of the most common diagnostic tests in the world today. Billions<br>
of tests are performed by use of different methods from the most elementary based on copper<br>
sulphate, to complete blood cell counts using sophisticated haematology analysers. These kinds of tests<br>
are measured on a majority of the world's population one or several times during a life time.<br>
Considering the population of the world today of 6 billion and growing, the need for a low cost, yet high<br>
quality point of care measurement of Hb and other parameters is very big.<br>
Of all tests performed today a great deal should benefit from being done with higher demand for safety<br>
and precision. The limited use of photometric method corresponding to these demands is probably a<br>
matter of time and cost. A preferred test method suitable for mass production must be subject to<br>
continuous cost reducing product development within the frames of both maintained quality and<br>
easiness of use also under rough conditions. Test methods must also fulfil stipulated specifications in<br>
standards.<br>
Basically and not including so called noninvasive measuring methods related to Hb, the cost of a Hb-test<br>
consists of the following factors exclusive the sampling:<br>
-	time of measurement<br>
-	cost of material/disposables<br>
-	equipment, (purchase, handling, service, calibration, lifetime etc.]<br>
-	In addition to this is the cost for sampling which is basically the same for all capillary methods<br>
which is cheaper than venous/arterial blood sampling in tubes.<br>
The major users of single Hb-tests are the Transfusion Centres where the Red Cross is the biggest actor<br>
country wise. It is mandatory in most countries to check the Hb-value prior to donation. Another area<br>
where it is also mandatory in several countries to check for Hb-value is maternity care. The best and<br>
most common technique for single Hb-measurement is by use of photometry. Normally light with<br>
specified wavelength passes through a small chamber (cuvette) containing the specimen. The cuvette<br>
can be of different size and shape and are often specially designed. The blood absorbs part of the light<br>
and the transmitting light is measured and the Hb-value calculated and displayed in a stable and precise<br>
way.<br><br>
Haemoglobin determination can be made in different ways. Hb-fractions can be measured directly by<br>
use of multiple wave lengths or all haemoglobin can be measured indirectly by use of one or two wave<br>
lengths after being converted chemically to a stable colour complex e.g. acid methaemoglobin. Common<br>
for these methods is that measurement takes place after hemolysation, break down of the red cell<br>
membrane, creating a solution of haemoglobin. It is possible to measure haemoglobin without<br>
haemolysing the red cells. This measurement can be done momentarily, which saves time and facilitates<br>
the handling, however brings great technical challenges. Whole blood with intact red cells is a colloid<br>
suspension with a strong tendency to scatter light, which if not handled in a right way will seriously<br>
disturb the measurement. Great consideration must be taken to minimize the scattering effects.<br>
Indirect measurement of total Hb is used J« in most of the common systems of the less complex kind on<br>
the market today. By use of a cuvette that is prepared with reagent for hemolysation and transforming<br>
of the haemoglobin to a stable colour complex in typical one minute, thus avoiding the scattering effect<br>
but at the same time no specification of the different Hb-fractions. A system utilizing this method<br>
successfully has been on the market for more than 20 years and other almost identical systems from<br>
Germany and USA have been introduced to the market lately.<br>
A more complex and sophisticated method is developed and patented in USA. This method is based on<br>
direct measuring of haemoglobin fractions, so called CO-Oximetry in unaltered whole blood. The<br>
method is based on multiple wave-length measuring of whole blood where the scattering effect is<br>
minimized by use of a large sensor in the photometer, collecting also scattered light. Algorithms are<br>
used to calculate and distinguish the Hb-fractions. Larger and more expensive disposable cuvettes are<br>
used in this system which is in terms of sophistication and price is less suitable for the mass market.<br>
All together the above mentioned and on the market existing systems has good features but also some<br>
disadvantages that can be overcome with new technique, new components and new thinking. The<br>
disadvantages are relatively high cost per test, time consuming and shelf life of cuvettes with reagent as<br>
salt with sensitivity to moisture and thereby risk of incorrect measurements.<br>
Microcuvettes are small cuvettes, size one to a few centimetre square. The cuvette, a type of container<br>
for liquids, is placed in an arrangement holding it in place for light penetration and measurement of<br>
transmitting light. The cuvette has a specific lumen in shape of a slit where the blood sample is placed<br><br>
and penetrated by light. Substances e.g. Hb-components have specific characteristics regarding light<br>
absorption/transmission, deflexion, refraction index etc. These characteristics are known for different<br>
Hb-components for example Hb bound to oxygen. Consequently the transmitted light is characterized by<br>
the absorption emanating from the substances in the sample together with the reflection and scattering<br>
that occurs when light is colliding with particles e.g. cells in during its passage through the sample. It is<br>
mainly the absorption that is the information searched in the transmitting light and - in the case of<br>
haemoglobin - is presented in relation to the chosen Hb-components, for example oxygen saturation.<br>
Each chosen wave-length contributes with information and gives additional information about a certain<br>
Hb-fraction. Wave-length of special interest is absorption max respective min and so called isobestic<br>
points. The totally transmitted light consists of a complex and the effect of scattering makes the<br>
interpretation of the measurement result even more complex.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be generally described from technical standpoint (theory, optics and<br>
information processing) in the following. Furthermore in connection to the enclosed drawings where<br>
Fig. 1 shows a handheld instrument^ Fig. 2 shows optic geometry, Fig. 3 shows the schematics for signal<br>
processing and Figs 4 and. 5 shows the correlation of HBX vs. reference measurements at an accredited<br>
laboratory.<br>
In HBX a new way is chosen for the elimination of unwanted scattering effects, different from previous<br>
hemolysation or use of a big sensor for optimising incoming light. The blood is unaltered during the<br>
measurement. This is of importance since it is also possible to measure continuously in a blood stream<br>
without destroying and the measurement takes only a second. The problem of light scattering from the<br>
red cells effecting the measurement is solved through an optic-geometric design of the light conducting<br>
components and cuvette minimizing scattered light to reach the detector as described more in detail<br>
below.<br>
HBX is also based on a new combination of information searched, chosen light source, cuvette type,<br>
choice of spectrophotometer, measuring procedure, and signal handling optimised for the purpose and<br>
mathematical algorithms. The invention comprises tree major parts, each one described below and in<br>
enclosed figures.<br><br>
Optical geometry<br>
The solution of the scattering problem in the invention is based upon a fundamental theory for light<br>
scattering (reference Twersky, V. Absorption and multiple scattering by biological suspensions. J. Opt.<br>
Soc. Am. 60:1084-1093,1970), in this case for fluids with suspended substance. The,, from theory<br>
emanating, alternatives is determined by the actual conditions at the chosen optical/geometrical<br>
procedure. The design is correlated to the amount of scattered light to reach the detector of the<br>
photometer.<br>
By arranging the light pathway to and from the cuvette using chosen angles of the light it is possible to<br>
prevent scattered light to reach the detector of the photometer or reduce the scattered light to a<br>
minimum and calculable level. Optimal effect is reached by minimizing the measuring area to a size<br>
related to the size of the light pathway at the same time as the possible light deviation from said light<br>
pathway to and from the measuring object to the photometer is strongly limited. In principle this<br>
technique is designed to be contrary to the above mentioned USA method where a maximum of<br>
scattered light is collected for processing.<br>
By choosing new fixed light sources with optimised characteristics e.g. light temperature, intensity<br>
(energy level) and adjustable exposure time or light sources with variable wave lengths it is possible to<br>
optimise the measuring set up for the spectrophotometer.<br>
Basically two principles or alternatives are applicable in HBX; one is a broad band light source (white<br>
light) in connection to a spectrophotometer registering the light intensity as a function of wave-length.<br>
The other alternative is a variable wave-length mono chromatic light source of laser/maser in<br>
connection to a standard photometer registering absobrance/transmittant light intensity. Which<br>
alternative is chosen is determined by type of measuring object, situation and purpose.<br>
The spectrophotometer in the first case is of type "monolithic multi-wavelengths.diode-array, MMWDA"<br>
a new application (Hb-fractions) for this type of spectrophotometer for medical diagnostic purpose. The<br>
spectrophotometer is in this case combined with broad spectrum white light and measures the<br>
transmitting light from the light source at all wave-lengths simultaneously.<br><br>
The alternative combination is more like the previously existing standard methods with a simpler<br>
photometer in combination with a state of the art light source with variable frequency i.e.	,<br>
monochromatic light of different chosen wave-lengths. In prior art this was achieved by use of separate<br>
light sources, each with different wave length corrected by use of filters. In the alternative with<br>
MMWDA-photometer it is also possible but unnecessary to use a variable monochromatic light. Both<br>
combinations of light source and photometer separately makes it possible to directly measure and<br>
extract each of the searched haemoglobin fraction. This is one of the main characteristics of HBX which<br>
measures four different Hb-fractions.; The instrument is for the purpose equipped with reference values<br>
for all the actual Hb-fractions extinction curves. HBX admits the possibility to automatically present the<br>
value of each of the Hb-fractions and in addition the total Hb-value.<br>
Signal processing<br>
Both of the above described alternatives light sources - photometer permits a great number of possible<br>
registrations of measuring data instantly, providing a possibility to choose freely the measuring points of<br>
interest from the complete measured sequences for further signal processing. Thereby the precision in<br>
the calculations can be decided and optimised.<br>
The method further admits calculation of the measuring error, for description of accuracy which is an<br>
integrated part of quality assurance. The measurement is performed so quickly that no significant time<br>
for the measuring procedure needs to be taken into consideration. The complete analysis of all fractions<br>
is performed within a second which is unelectable in comparison with the other moments of an Hb-<br>
analysis e.g. sampling etc. This further admits consecutive measurements over cycles of 30-60 per<br>
minute or even continues measurements. Signal processing involves processor, memory for reference<br>
and measured data, algorithms for the chosen measuring data and compensation for possible scattering<br>
effects or deviations emanating from abnormal/unexpected data. The algorithm for<br>
calculation/elimination of light scattering is based upon accepted theories described in scientific<br>
publications. Further algorithms and approximations are based on least square method.<br>
The invention HBX comprise several part inventions in terms of:<br>
1) An optical geometry for minimizing scattered light to the detector in order to make<br>
measurements possible for accurate determination of chosen substances in colloid solutions,<br>
for example whole blood.<br><br>
2)	Two alternative measuring principles with the same purpose of creating data for selection of<br>
measuring points over a wide wave-length range. This can be based upon a firm broad band<br>
white light source in combination with a spectrophotometer or a variable narrow wave-lengths<br>
light source in combination with a standard type photometer.<br>
3)	A series of algorithms for signal processing designed for standard corrections, for the optical<br>
geometry and for calculations of approximations by use of a number of chosen measuring<br>
points.<br>
4)	A combination of above described part solutions enables very fast measuring cycles. The time<br>
consumption for each measuring cycle permits measurements faster than for example heart<br>
rate which makes the method suitable for continuous measuring of blood flow.<br>
Even though HBX at every measuring situation enables a large amount of measuring data it |s not<br>
necessary to use all of these. In practise it is possible for a given purpose e.g. custom model/design of<br>
equipment, to utilize a limited or extended amount of data corresponding significantly to the purpose or<br>
application.<br>

S	Area for light conductor contact and light "trap"<br>
T	Main line - the optical axis, in the figure shown at 90 degrees angle vs. the cuvette surface.<br>
The light from the light source (1) is applied exactly adapted and geometrically thorough as in Fig. IT<br>
directly and possibly through correction with condenser and lenses (6), towards a diaphragm/aperture<br>
(7) or, as in Fig. 2- through an optic fibre (5) directly from the light source (1) to the measuring are of<br>
the cuvette (2) for incoming light at B. The optical fibre may have a diameter typical d2=0.1-3 mm.<br>
The light angle of incidence is 90° (perpendicular) towards the cuvette surface and passes basically as a<br>
parallel pencil along the straight main light pathway, the optical axis A' towards F. In the case a<br>
laser/maser is used the light is in practice parallel to A'. The light source can be a LED, laser, flash etc.<br>
Light conducting may be used.<br>
The light passes the cuvette walls and penetrates the sample,. The measuring cuvette is likely of micro<br>
stand type for distinct single measurements or a specially designed flow through type with a valve or a<br>
movable slot for continuous Hb-measurement in tubing. The measuring cuvette is a container (9) in the<br>
size of one to a few square centimetres in which there are two close to parallel surfaces in the size of 5-<br>
20 mm2 and in between a cavity/slot - the sampling area - with a characteristic distance between the<br>
surfaces of OTOS 0.05 - 0,5 mm = slit distance.<br>
The surfaces creates together a closed cavity where a small volume - defined as the slit or sampling<br>
volume - consists of a precise slit distance which is connected to the sample (e.g. blood) inlet. The<br>
cuvette is placed in a holder connected to the instrument. The holder ensures that the cuvette is<br>
brought in an exact position and geometry to the light conducting components and photometer.<br>
The blood sample in the equivalent of a small drop is introduced in the sample cavity by the capillary<br>
force provided by the cuvette design. The shape and slit distance admits light transmission through a<br>
small but sufficient sampling volume for significant measuring of Hb-fractions by use of direct<br><br>
photometric method. Pencil light pathway through the sample along the optical axis is equal to the slit<br>
distance (t).<br>
The cuvette including slit and other details is produced in one step with a precision that makes quality<br>
control in addition to the stipulated random sampling in the production redundant. This makes the<br>
cuvette inexpensive to produce.<br>
A flow through cuvette for continuous measurement has channels/connections as inlet and outlet.<br>
In the case of continuous measurement is based on consecutive/batch wise measurements there is a<br>
valve mechanism for pulsating supply of a specified blood volume. This volume can be typical 2-4 times<br>
the cuvette volume which for a normal flow through cuvette is in the range of 0.1-0.4 ml (cm3). This<br>
provides a good flow through and rinsing of previous measurement. The device can be directly<br>
connected to the blood source e.g. the patient or research object, the blood pressure of whom provides<br>
the flow.<br>
As light passes through the sample fluid it will collide with particles e.g. blood cells. Some light will be<br>
absorbed and some will scatter and continue in different direction from the in falling. The intensity of<br>
the light is adjusted by the distance from the light source to the measuring area of the cuvette but also<br>
by adjusting the aperture and electronic regulating by the control unit in the microprocessor. By<br>
immediate feedback, before and during measurement or transmission, of light variations in the light<br>
source, deviations can be immediately adjusted or calibrated automatically in the signal processing.<br>
The light does not refract or diffract upon reaching the incoming transparent surface of the cuvette<br>
material containing the sample as (B and a - c) as in outgoing light surface (b - d) since the light in the<br>
configuration falls in at 90° perpendicular to the surface.<br>
A certain part of the light finds it way through the blood within the volume a - b - c - d mainly parallel<br>
with the main line of light A'-F and continues parallel through the are A which is a light trap eliminating<br>
non parallel light. Collected light at e - f continues further through the light fibre F to the sensor.(8).<br><br>
Light is partly absorbed by Hb-fractions in the cells (suspended in the fluid/blood sample) and the<br>
remaining (transmitting) light continues unaltered along.the main light line A - F.<br>
Light hitting the suspension will be scattered in all directions and keeps hitting yet other suspended<br>
particles/cells where it will be absorbed or reflected according to known principles for light scattering in<br>
suspensions e.g. blood. The occurring scattered light will deviate in angle from the line A1 - F. The<br>
geometry is designed in a way that the opening for outgoing light is small in comparison to the light path<br>
to the receiving light transmitter (fibre) leading to the sensor.<br>
The behaviour pattern of the light depends on the wave length in relation to the aperture, the same as<br>
the receiving light conductor. Previously was mentioned that the receiving optical fibre has a diameter<br>
of &amp;ri OJL- 3 mm, corresponding to an area of (0.12&amp;Wto 32) x 7t/4«0.008-7 mm2 = size of the aperture<br>
for in and outgoing light preferably 1 mm2. The geometry limits the scattered light to enter the outgoing<br>
optical fibre and a very small part of the scattered light has such direction as to reach the sensor of the<br>
photometer. If the angle of incidence islargerthan a certain value depending on the solution and<br>
refraction index of the cuvette, a total reflection will occur with no light reaching the sensor.<br>
The outgoing light surface is directed towards the light conductor. A so called light "trap"(10) may be<br>
placed between the cuvette and the light conductor, with a space A which further reduces light non<br>
parallel (scattering): The light trap consists of a non reflective (light absorbing) space in the shape of a<br>
cylinder with a length Land an inner diameter (d2
have concentric holes of diameter d2 for fitting to cuvette and light conductor. The transmitted light<br>
passes the light trap (10) before entering the light conductor where further deviated light will be<br>
absorbed in the cylinder A. The length is in relation to the diameter of the light conductor and can be<br>
typical between 5 - 30 x the diameter d2 or in the case of a diameter d2 = OJ. Qji mm between QT5 0.5-3<br>
mm. Possible scattered light which fits within the boundaries of the geometry can be considered as<br>
parallel when reaching the sensor, correction can be made in the signal processing.<br>
The electronic parts of the instrument contains details for monitoring and signal processing with<br>
different choices of manual or pre-chosen automatic functions/modes. It contains CPU, memory,<br>
programs, algorithms, time oscillator, drivers, display, interface to external units, input for external units<br><br>
e.g. bar code readers. It has mains power supply, battery back up etc. Communication with LAN and<br>
Internet, using current standards of interface e.g. infra light, Blue Tooth etc.<br>
The electronic part is built mainly of standard components like processors, memories, and drivers. The<br>
specific signal processing is programmed in the processor along with factors concerning blood<br>
components and/or other in the sample intended components.<br>
Corrections and calculations of approximations is performed in a number of internal developed<br>
algorithms which typical can be four or more. These are programmed in the processor for signal<br>
processing, seer Fig. 3 with figure references.<br>
The described configuration of units and signal processing with different algorithms and its purpose is<br>
one appropriate variant depending the choice of components, purpose and object of measuring,<br>
measuring situation, optical geometry etc. Other configurations may be considered including additional<br>
or fewer algorithms to measuring result. In certain applications the measuring points may also be<br>
additional or fewer. The presentation of the measuring results can be varied and selected depending on<br>
the main interest of the user e.g. Hb-fractions or simple total Hb. In some applications it is of value to<br>
follow a time dependent picture (profile) the values must then be stored in a time related way for<br>
retrospective analysis. Different levels of automation may be included to facilitate for the operator.<br>
The picture of the signal registered by the photometer will be corrected and compensated for by<br>
stepwise calculations - the algorithm process - for deviations emanating from geometry, light variations<br>
and fluctuations, back-ground influence, light scattering, absorption by other components than the<br>
desired Hb-fractions etc. The signal processing executes at the operator's command or automatically a<br>
suitable number of measuring points from a registered measuring picture. Based upon the chosen<br>
measuring points a series of iterations is automatically performed according to "the least square<br>
method" for optimal fit of measuring values compared to stored reference values e.g.-fractions.<br>
This corresponds to the direct results/Hb-values - as fractions or as total- which is coded and stored to<br>
avoid mix-up. The values are shown on a display and may by the instrument be transmitted by wire or<br>
wireless to central data base. The whole process is basically instant or within a second without delay.<br>
The number of measuring points to obtain desired accuracy of the result can be determined<br>
automatically at operators choice. A minimum of two points may give enough accuracy for certain<br><br>
purposes. Up to seven measuring points is used today In HBX an optional number of measuring points<br>
can be chosen (2
diminished over a certain numbers (provided the optimal ones are used).<br>
Fig. 4 and figr Fig. 5 shows two examples from a variety of laboratory test comparisons of HBX^ HBX-<br>
method vs. the excising reference meted (ABL) performed at the accredited Hospital Clin._Chem.<br>
Laboratory at Helsingborg Hospital. The result is presented as analysis of regression. Fig. 4 shows the<br>
HB-fraction - oxygenised haemoglobin (Hb02) - one essential component of CO-Oximetry<br>
measurements. Hb02 is normally the dominating Hb- fraction and in intensive care the most important.<br>
Depending on the specific situation of the patient and purpose of the Hb-measurement, other<br>
components may be the most important. As shown in the diagram the correlation is Qy99 0.99 which is<br>
very high.<br>
Figjj shows a regression analysis of HBX vs. reference method for total Hb, the sum of the different Hb-<br>
fractions. Total Hb is the most frequent Hb measurement in health care and blood banking. As shown in<br>
the diagram the correlation is 0.98. This is considered as high with low deviations and in line with<br>
current methods and criteria for Hb measurement.<br>
The results shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 verify that the ideas, theory and inventions behind the HBX<br>
concept concerning the combination of the specific choices and design of "optical geometry" and light<br>
source - detector in combination with HBX signal processing is realistic and applicable in practice.<br><br>
