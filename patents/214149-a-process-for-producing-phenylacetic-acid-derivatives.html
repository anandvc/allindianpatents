				<td>The present invention relates to processes for the production of 2-phenylamino-5-alkylphenyl acetic acids (the compounds of formula I given below), intermediates therefor and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters thereof; <br>
wherein	R is methyl or ethyl;<br>
R1 is chloro or fluoro;<br>
R2 is hydrogen or fluoro;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy or<br>
hydroxy;<br>
R4 is hydrogen or fluoro; and<br>
R5 is chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl or methyl, provided that Ri, R2, R4 and R5 are not all fluoro when R is ethyl and R3 is H.<br>
Accordingly in a first aspect the invention provides a process for the production of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable and physiologically cleavable prodrug ester thereof, comprising cleaving a lactam of formula n<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above with a base.<br><br>
The above processes may include, if desired, temorarily protecting any interfering reactive groups and then isolating the resulting conpound of the invention; and, if desired, converting the free carboxylic acid of the confound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivative thereof; and/or if desired, converting the free acid of formula I into a salt or a resulting salt into the free acid or into another salt.<br>
The above processes may be carried out under conditions known in the art for the hydrolytic cleavage of lactams, preferably with a strong base, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide (e.g. a 30% aqueous solution of NaOH), optionally in the presence of a water miscible organic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. at a temperature in the range from about 50° to 100°C, (for instance as generally described in US Patent 3,558,690). The resultant reaction mixture is conveniently neutralised with an acid, e.g. a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid to give the free acid product of formula I, which may be recovered by crystallisation, e.g. on cooling of the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, and filtration.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters are ester derivatives which are convertible by solvolysis or under physiological conditions to the free carboxylic acids of formula I. Such esters are e.g. lower alkyl esters (such as the methyl or ethyl ester), carboxy-lower alkyl esters such as the carboxymethyl ester, nitrooxy-lower alkyl esters (such as the 4-nitrooxybutyl ester), and the like.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts represent metal salts, such as alkaline metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, as well as ammonium salts, which are formed e.g. with ammonia and mono- or di-alkylamines, such as diethylammonium salts, and with amino acids such as arginine and histidine salts.<br>

5-methyl-2-(2",4"-dicWoro-6"-trifluoromethylanilino)phenylaceticacid,<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters thereof.<br><br>
Standard mild oxidation conditions may be used, such as heating with catalytical amounts of palladium on charcoal in a proper solvent, e.g. xylene.<br>
The lactam of formula III may be prepared by coupling an aniline derivative of formula IV<br>
  IV<br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, with a cyclohexanone derivative of formula Va or an amino substituted cyclohexene derivative of formula Vb<br><br>
wherein R is ethyl or methyl and R" is lower alkyl or sunilar.<br>
Coupling of IV with Va and Vb typically involves elimination of water or the secondary amine, HNR"2, e.g. under acidic conditions.<br>
Vb may be prepared by reaction of the amino substitutes cyclohexene derivative of formula Vb"<br><br>
wherein R and R" are as defined above, with methyl or ethyl glyoxylate. Vb may be converted to Va by hydrolysis, for instance as hereinafter described in the Examles.<br>
Alternatively the lactam of formula II is obtained by cyclisation of a compound of formulaVII<br><br>
Particularly preferred compounds of formula I which may be prepared according to the present invention include:<br>
5-methyl-2-(2", 3", 4", 6"-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetic acid;<br>
5-methyl-2-(2",6"-dichloroanilino)phenylaceticacid;<br>
5-methyl-2-(2"-chloro-6"fluoroanilino)phenylacetic acid;<br>
5-methyl-2-(2",6"-dichloro-4"-methylanilino)phenylacetic acid;<br>
5-methyl-2-(2"-chloro-6"-methylanilino)phenylacetic acid;<br>
5-methyl-2-(2"-chloro-4"-fluoro-6"-methylanilino)phenylacetic acid;<br>
5-ethyl-2-(2"-fluoro-6"-chloroanilino)phenylaceticacid;<br>
5-ethyl-2-(2"-chloro-6"-methylanilino)phenylaceticacid;<br>
5-ethyl-2-(2",3",6"-trifluroanilino)phenylacetic acid, and<br>
5-ethyl-2-(2",4"-dichloro-6"-methylanilino)phenylaceticacid,<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
prodrug esters thereof.<br>
Thus, preferably also the processes of the invention may be used to prepare compounds of formula I in which R is methyl or ethyl; R1, is chloro or fluoro; R2 is hydrogen; R3 is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, methyl or hydroxy; R4 is hydrogen; R5 is chloro, fluoro or methyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug ester thereof.<br>
The lactam of formula II may be prepared by oxidation of a lactam of formula<br>
III<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above.<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above.<br>
The cyclisation process is conveniently carried out under Friedel-Crafts alkylation conditions, e.g. in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst such as aluminium chloride or ethyl aluminium dichloride, preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. a temperature in the range from about 100° to about 180°C. The cyclisation reaction may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent such as dichlorobenzene, or preferably a melt of the compound of formula VII is heated with the Friedel-Crafts catalyst.<br>
The compound of formula VII is prepared by N-acylation of a diphenylamine of formula Vm <br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above with a haloacetyl chloride.<br>
For instance, the compound of formula Vni is heated, e.g. to about 80°C, with chloroacetylchloride. The product may be recovered by diluting the reaction mixture with solvent, e.g. 2-propanol, and crystallisation.<br>
The compound of formula VII may be obtained by rearrangement and hydrolysis of a compound of formula DC.<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above.<br>
Conveniently the compound of formula IX is treated with an organic base, e.g. an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide, preferably with heating, e.g. to a ten^erature of at least about 75°C. During this procedure an intermediate product of formula X, <br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, forms as a result of the initial rearrangement reaction, but undergoes direct cleavage under the prevailing reaction conditions to give the diphenylamine compound of formula Vin.<br>
Alternatively the diphenylamine compound of formula Vin may be obtained by coupling of the corresponding halobenzene derivative of formula XI<br><br>
where X is a halogen, e.g. I or Br, and the other symbols are as defined above with p-toluidine or 4-ethyl aniline.<br>
Such a coupling reaction may be carried out by use of Buchwald chemistry. For example, the compound of formula XI and the p-tohiidine or 4-ethyl aniline are mixed<br><br>
with an organic base, e.g. sodium tertiary butylate, and an appropriate ligand, e.g. BINAP, in an organic solvent such as toluene; a palladium compound or catalyst precursor such as Pd(dba)2 is added and the reaction mixture is heated. After cooling and treatment with acid, e.g. HCl, the diphenylamine product of formula VIII may be recovered from the organic phase of the reaction mixture.<br>
In a further alternative, the diphenylamine compound of formula VIII may be obtained by coupling of the corresponding aniline derivative of formula IV<br><br>
as defined above with 4-bromotoluene or l-ethyl-4-bromobenzene. Such a coupling reaction may be carried out similarly by use of Buchwald chemistry. For example, the confound of formula IV and the 4-bromotoluene or l-ethyl-4-bromobenzene are mixed with an organic base, e.g. sodium tertiary butylate in an organic solvent such as toluene; a palladium compound or catalyst precursor e.g. Pd(dba)2, and a ligand, e.g. P(tBu)3, or BINAP, are added to this reaction mixture which is then stirred at elevated temperature, e.g. 110°C, until completion of the reaction, e.g. overnight. Similarly the diphenylamine product of formula VIE may be recovered from the organic phase of the reaction mixture, for instance after cooling and treatment with acid, e.g. HCl.<br>
The compound of formula IX may be prepared by alkylation of the corresponding phenol derivative of formula XII<br><br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, with 2-chloro-N-(4-methylphenyl)acetamide or 2 ch]oro-N-(4-ethylphenyl)acetamide. For instance, the compound of formula XII and 2-chloro-N-(4-methylphenyl)acetaniide or 2-chloro-N-(4-ethylphenyl)acetamide are mixed in an organic solvent such as 2-propanol in the presence of a base, e.g. K2CO3, and the reaction mixture boiled until completion of the reaction, e.g. for about 4 hours. 2-chloro-N-(4-methylphenyl)acetamide and 2-chloro-N-(4-ethylphenyl)acetamide may be prepared, e.g. in situ, by reaction of 4-methyl- or 4-ethylaniline with chloroacetyl chloride. The compound of formula IX may be recovered from the reaction mixture if desired. Preferably, however, the compound of formula IX is not isolated but is converted to the compound of formula VHI, by rearrangement and hydrolysis as described above carried out on the product reaction mixture resulting from the alkylation of the compound of formula Xn.<br>
Alternatively the diphenylamine of formula Vni may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound of formula XHI (or tautomer thereof)<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above.<br>
The dehydrogenation reaction may be carried out by classical methods, for instance by treatment with iodine, e.g. I2 in THF/AcOH.<br>
The compound of formula XIII may be prepared by coupling of l-methoxy-4-methylcyclohexa-l,4-diene or l-methoxy-4-ethylcyclohexa-l,4-diene with an aniline derivative of formula IV as defined above.<br>
This coupling reaction may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as TiCl4, in organic solvents e.g. THF and chlorobenzene, preferably with cooling, e.g. at about -40°C.<br>
l-methoxy-4-inethylcyclohexa-l,4-diene or l-methoxy-4-ethylcyclohexa-l,4-diene may be prepared by partial reduction of 4-methyIanisole or 4-ethylanisole by<br><br>
Birch reduction, e.g. by treatment with Na in liquid ammonia, for instance as described by Subba Rao et al. Australian Journal of Chemistry 1992,45, p. 187-203.<br>
Conveniently the confound of formula Xni is not isolated, but the coupling reaction between the conpound of formula IV and the l-methoxy-4-niethylcyclohexa-1,4-diene or l-methoxy-4-ethylcyclohexa-l,4-diene, is followed by oxidation to give the diphenylamine derivative of formula VIII.<br>
In starting compounds and intermediates, which are converted to the compounds of formulae I to XDI in a manner as hereinbefore described, functional groups present such as amino, hydroxy and carboxyl groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected hydroxy, amino and carboxyl groups are those that can be converted under nuld conditions into free amino, hydroxy and carboxyl groups without other undesirable side reactions taking place. For example, hydroxy protecting groups are preferably benzyl or substituted benzyl groups.<br>
