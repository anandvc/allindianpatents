				<td>A CERAMIC MIXTURE HAVING NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT,<br>
A THERMISTOR CONTAINING THE CERAMIC MIXTURE<br>
AND A PROCESS FOR PREPAING THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel ceramic mixture having negative temperature<br>
coefficient of resistance and a process for preparing said ceramic mixture. The present<br>
Invention also relates to a thermistor prepared from the said ceramic mixture that can<br>
work at a temperature range of 330°C ± 6% and a process for preparing the said<br>
thermistor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A thermistor is a thermally sensitive resistor whose primary function is to exihibit a<br>
change in electric resistance with a change in body temperature. Unlike a wire wound<br>
or metal film resistance temperature detector (RTD), a thermistor is a ceramic<br>
semiconductor. It has a metal sheathing (stainless steel or Inconel) and contains one<br>
or two thermocouple Sensing Wires (Chromel-Alumel-K Type) or Chromel-<br>
Constantan-E type) running parallel to the metal sheathing and insulated from each<br>
other and sheathing by a ceramic insulating compound. Depending on the type of<br>
material used, a thermistor can have either a large positive temperature coefficient of<br>
resistance (PTC) or a large negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTC).<br>
Thermal sensors can detect temperature, infra-red source and its size, moving<br>
direction and speed, emissivity and wave length. As such these can find applications<br>
in intruder alarms, fire alarms, laser detection, thermal recording etc (Sensors and<br>
Actuators, by MoonhoLee, Mina Yoo, A-96(2002) P. 97-104). NTC sensors now a<br>
days are the most commonly used in automotive applications (Sensors, Vol IV, by<br>
W.Gopel, J. Hesse, J.N. Zemel Vol. 4, (1990)) and in precise temperature<br>
monitoring devices for temperature measurements, control and compensation. These<br>
sensors can provide precise temperature information at critical points. These type of<br>
sensors are reliable, stable, re-useable and maintenance free. A number of materials<br>
have been reported.<br>
Thermistors are polycrystalline mixtures of sintered metallic oxides (NiO,<br>
€0263) or solid solutions (MgCO in FesO) that behave essentially as<br>
semiconductors. As a result they have negative temperature coefficients of resistance.<br>
They have proved successfully in a variety of shapes as small, inexpensive, sensitive,<br>
fast response temperature sensors, within the range - 100°C to 300°C. Thermistors<br>
for above 300°C are made of oxides of rare earth elements, which are more refractory<br>
than nickel and manganese oxides and possesses higher activation energy.<br>
Thermistors for cryogenic use are mostly made from non-stoichiometric iron oxides<br>
which exhibit very low activation energy (Sensors, Vol IV, by W.Gopel, J. Hesse,<br>
J.N. Zemel Vol. 4, (1990)).<br>
NTC thermistors consist of metal oxides such as oxides of Manganese, chromium,<br>
Cobalt, copper, Iron, Nickel, Titanium with different stoichiometric ratio etc. with<br>
different combination (Measurements, Instrumentation and Sensors Hand Book by<br>
Meyer Sapoff, P. 32.25). These exhibit a monotonic decrease in electric resistance<br>
with an increase in temperature. A number of papers have also been published with<br>
different combination of La-Sr-Mn-O film Lao.7sCao.25 MnOa, L&amp;yi Sr 1/3 MnOs<br>
pervoskite etc. for magnetoresistive sensor (4,5,6,7). However, no studies so far have<br>
been reported with 95% MnjC^ and 5% L^Oa mixture as NTC material.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig.l shows process flow sheet for the preparation of NTC ceramic compound<br>
working upto 350°C<br>
The present invention is described further with respect to the example, which is given<br>
by way of illustration and hence, should not be considered to limit the scope of the<br>
invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
Manganese di-oxide (MnCh) Analytical Reagent (AR) quality was taken in silica<br>
crucibles and heated to a temperature of 1050°C in a muffle furnace. The MnO2 was<br>
kept at this temperature for 4 to 5 hours in order to convert MnO2 to Mn3O4 The<br>
structure of Mna is tetragonal and is confirmed by XRD. The material is then<br>
furnace cooled. Mn3O4 is then ground in mortar and pestle and sieved through 250<br>
size BSS mesh (
oxide (La2O3) and ground thoroughly in mortar and pestle to obtain the ceramic<br>
mixture. Stearic acid (1%) and wax (1%) was then added and again ground using<br>
alcohol. It was then slowly heated in order to remove the alcohol. The mixture was<br>
again ground and sieved through 250 BSS Mesh. The material is characterized for<br>
potential drop and resistance change. The mixture thus obtained having ceramic<br>
powder, steric acid and wax is filled in about one foot long stainless steel tubes and<br>
two sensing wires (chromel and alumel wires) are inserted into the powder inside the<br>
tube. The powder is then compacted inside the tube by ramming. These tubes were<br>
then sintered at 900°C for 4 to 5 hours so that the material becomes a hard mass. The<br>
powder can otherwise be compressed at about 10 tonnes/Inch2 in a die to make<br>
pellets/tablets. A detailed block diagram of depicting the process for preparing the<br>
ceramic mixture and the thermistor thereof is shown in Figure 1. These ceramic<br>
tablets/filled tubes with ceramic powder were characterized for potential drop and<br>
drop in resistance. The tests were repeated several times for about one year to check<br>
the stability/repeatability of the test results. The results of the test thus conducted are<br>
tabulated in Table 1 given below.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
• It gives NTC characteristics.<br>
• This material has resistance of the order of mega ohms at 25°C and this value<br>
drops to 200-300 ohms between 300°C-350°C. Therefore, this material has<br>
been used in fire safety sensors/devices for strategic applications.<br>
• The material has good flowability. Therefore, it is possible to fill up this<br>
material in small diameter and long tubes.<br>
• The material does not degrade with time, temperature and other environmental<br>
changes.<br>
• The chemicals are easily available and processable.<br><br><br><br><br>
