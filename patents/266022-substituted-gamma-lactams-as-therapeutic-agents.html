By Inventors David W. Old and Danny T. Dinh<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Ocular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as presurgical adjuncts.<br>
Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged cataract.<br>
The underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against the angle, and may produce pupilary block and thus precipitate an acute attack. Eyes with narrow anterior chamber angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity.<br>
Secondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe, and may plug the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular rumors, enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative procedures and intraocular hemorrhage.<br>
Considering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, topical p-adrenoreceptor antagonists have traditionally been the drugs of choice for treating glaucoma.<br>
Certain eicosanoids and their derivatives are currently commercially available for use in glaucoma management. Eicosanoids and derivatives include numerous biologically important compounds such as prostaglandins and their derivatives. Prostaglandins can be described as derivatives of prostanoic acid which have the following structural formula: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Various types of prostaglandins are known, depending on the structure and substituents carried on the alicyclic ring of the prostanoic acid skeleton. Further classification is based on the number of unsaturated bonds in the side chain indicated by numerical subscripts after the generic type of prostaglandin [e.g. prostaglandin E1(PGEi), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)], and on the configuration of the substituents on the alicyclic ring indicated by a or p [e.g. prostaglandin F2α. (PGF2ß)].<br>
Prostaglandin EP2 selective agonists are believed to have several medical uses. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,437,146 teaches the use of prostaglandin EP2 selective agonists "for treating or preventing inflammation and pain in joint and muscle (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, juvenile arthritis, etc.), inflammatory skin condition (e.g., sunburn, burns, eczema, dermatitis, etc.), inflammatory eye condition (e.g., conjunctivitis, etc.), lung disorder in which inflammation is involved (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, pigeon fancier's disease, farmer's lung, etc.), condition of the gastrointestinal tract associated with inflammation (e.g., aphthous ulcer, Chrohn's disease, atrophic gastritis, gastritis varialoforme, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, regional ileitis, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.), gingivitis, inflammation, pain and tumescence after operation or injury, pyrexia, pain and other conditions associated with inflammation, allergic disease, systemic lupus crythematosus, scleroderma, polymyositis, tendinitis, bursitis, periarteritis nodose, rheumatic fever, Sjgren's syndrome, Behcet disease, thyroiditis, type I diabetes, diabetic complication (diabetic microangiopathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neohropathy, etc.), nephrotic syndrome, aplastic anemia, myasthenia gravis, uveitis contact dermatitis, psoriasis, Kawasaki disease, sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's disease, Alzheimers disease, kidney dysfunction (nephritis, nephritic syndrome, etc.), liver dysfunction (hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), gastrointestinal dysfunction (diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) shock, bone disease characterized by abnormal bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (especially, postmenopausal osteoporosis), hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, Paget's bone diseases, osteolysis, hypercalcemia of malignancy with or without bone metastases, rheumatoid arthritis, periodonritis, osteoarthritis, ostealgia, osteopenia, cancer cachexia, calculosis, lithiasis (especially, urolithiasis), solid carcinoma, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, edema (e.g. cardiac edema, cerebral edema, etc.), hypertension such as<br>
malignant hypertension or the like, premenstrual tension, urinary calculus, oliguria such as the one caused by acute or chronic failure, hyperphosphaturia, or the like."<br>
United State Patent No 6,710,072 teaches the use of EP2 agonists for the treatment or prevention of "osteoporosis, constipation, renal disorders, sexual dysfunction, baldness, diabetes, cancer and in disorder of immune regulation... various pathophysiological diseases including acute myocardial infarction, vascular thrombosis, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and angina pectoris."<br>

A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is any salt that retains the activity of the parent compound and does not impart any additional deleterious or untoward effects on the subject to which it is administered and in the context in which it is administered compared to the parent compound. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt also refers to any salt which may form in vivo as a result of administration of an acid, another salt, or a prodrug which is converted into an acid or salt.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic functional groups may be derived from organic or inorganic bases. The salt may comprise a mono or polyvalent ion. Of particular interest are the inorganic ions, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Organic salts may be made with amines, particularly ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and trialkyl amines or ethanol amines. Salts may also be formed with caffeine, tromethamine and similar molecules. Hydrochloric acid or some other pharmaceutically acceptable acid may form a salt with a compound that includes a basic group, such as an amine or a pyridine ring.<br>
A "prodrug" is a compound which is converted to a therapeutically active compound after administration, and the term should be interpreted as broadly herein as is generally understood in the art. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention, conversion may occur by hydrolysis of an ester group or some other biologically labile group. Generally, but not necessarily, a prodrug is inactive or less active than the therapeutically active compound to which it is converted. Ester prodrugs of the compounds disclosed herein are specifically contemplated. An ester may be derived from a carboxylic acid of CI (i.e. the terminal carboxylic acid of a natural prostaglandin), or an ester may be derived from a carboxylic acid functional group on another part of the molecule, such as on a phenyl ring. While not intending to be limiting, an ester may be an alkyl ester, an aryl ester, or a heteroaryl ester. The term alkyl has the meaning generally understood by those skilled in the art and refers to linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl moieties. C1-6 alkyl esters are particularly useful, where alkyl part of the ester has from I to 6 carbon atoms and includes, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, .sec-butyl, iso-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl isomers, hexyl isomers, cyclopropyl,<br>
cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and combinations thereof having from 1-6 carbon atoms, etc<br>
A metabolite is broadly defined as a compound which is formed in vivo from the disclosed compound.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily understand that for administration or the manufacture of medicaments the compounds disclosed herein can be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which per se are well known in the art. Specifically, a drug to be administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like, or as a solution, emulsion, suspension, aerosol, syrup or elixir suitable for oral or parenteral administration or inhalation.<br>
For solid dosage forms or medicaments, non-toxic solid carriers include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, the polyalkylene glycols, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose and magnesium carbonate. The solid dosage forms may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distcarate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable dosage forms can, for example, comprise a solution or suspension of one or more of the presently useful compounds and optional pharmaceutical adjutants in a carrier, such as for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. Typical examples of such auxiliary agents are sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 16th Edition, 1980. The composition of the formulation to be administered, in any event, contains a quantity of one or more of the presently useful compounds in an amount effective to provide the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like.<br>
The amount of the presently useful compound or compounds administered is, of course, dependent on the therapeutic effect or effects desired, on the specific mammal being treated, on the severity and nature of the mammal's condition, on the manner of administration, on the potency and pharmacodynamics of the particular compound or compounds employed, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. The therapeutically effective dosage of the presently useful compound or compounds is preferably in the range of about 0.5 or about I to about 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
A liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.<br>
For ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. Ophthalmic solutions should preferably be maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.<br>
Preservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A useful surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various useful vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations of the present invention. These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and purified water,<br>
Tonicity adjusters may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjuster.<br>
Various buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the resulting preparation is ophthalmically acceptable.

Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease may be accomplished by the administration of the compounds described herein to the suffering mammal. Inflammatory bowel disease describes a variety of diseases characterized by inflammation of the bowels including, but not limited to, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment may be accomplished by oral administration, by suppository, or parenteral administration, or some other suitable method.<br>
While not intending to limit the scope of the invention in any way, delivery of the compounds disclosed herein to the colon via oral dosage forms may be accomplished by any of a number of methods known in the art. For example, reviews by Chourasia and Jain in J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci 6(1): 33-66, 2003 and Shareef et. al (AAPS PharmSci 2003; 5 (2) Article 17) describe a number of useful methods. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention in any way these methods include 1) administration of a prodrug, including an azo or a carbohydrate based prodrug; 2) coating the drug with, or encapsulating or impregnating the drug into a polymer designed for delivery to the colon, 3) time released delivery of the drug, 4) use of a bioadhesive system; and the like.<br>
While not intending to be bound in any way by theory, it is believed that intestinal microflora are capable of reductive cleavage of an azo bond leaving the two nitrogen atoms as amine functional groups. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention in any way, the azo prodrug approach has been used to deliver to 5-aminosalicylic acid to the colons of humans in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. It is also believed that bacteria of the lower GI also have enzymes which can digest glycosides, glucuronides, cyclodextrins, dextrans, and other carbohydrates, and ester prodrugs formed from these carbohydrates have been shown to deliver the parent active drugs selectively to the colon. For example, in vivo and in vitro studies on rats and guinea pigs with prodrugs of dexamethasone,<br>
prednisolone, hydrocortisone, and fludrocortisone, suggest that glycoside conjugates may be useful for the delivery of steroids to the human colon. Other in vivo studies have suggested that glucouronide, cyclodextrin, and dextran prodrugs of steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful for delivery of these drugs to the lower GI tract. An amide of salicylic acid and glutamic acid has been shown to be useful for the delivery of salicylic acid to the colon of rabbit and dog.<br>
While not intending to limit the scope of the invention in any way, carbohydrate polymers such as amylase, arabinogalactan, chitosan, chondroiton sulfate, dextran, guar gum, pectin, xylin, and the like, or azo-group containing polymers can be used to coat a drug compound, or a drug may be impregnated or encapsulated in the polymer. It is believed that after oral administration, the polymers remain stable in the upper GI tract, but are digested by the microflora of the lower GI thus releasing the drug for treatment.<br>
Polymers which are sensitive to pH may also be used since the colon has a higher pH than the upper GI tract. Such polymers are commercially available. For example, Rohm Pharmaceuticals, Darmstadt, Germany, markets pH dependent methacrylate based polymers and copolymers which have varying solubilities over different pH ranges based upon the number of free carboxylate groups in the polymer under the tradename Eudragit®. Several Eudragit® dosage forms are currently used to deliver salsalazine for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Time release systems, bioadhesive systems, and other delivery systems have also been studied.<br>

°C, the reaction was quenched slowly with 3 N HCl (20 mL) and concentrated in vacuo. The<br>
residue was diluted with water (30 mL) and extracted with Et2O (3 x 150 mL). Combined<br>
extracts were dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the residue by<br>
flash column chi omatography on silica gel (5% - 10% EtOAc/Hex) afforded 5.6 g (76%) of 1-(4-bromophenyl)-heptan-l-ol. Step 2. Protection of the alcohol as its MPM ether<br>
Sodium hydride (60% wt, in oil, 0.991 g, 24.8 mmol) was added to a solution of the alcohol from step I (5.6 g, 20.6 mmol) in THF and DMF (2:1, 30 mL) at 0 °C under nitrogen. After 5 min at 0 °C, the reaction was allowed to warm to rt and 4-methoxybenzyl chloride (3.4 mL, 25.0 mmol) was added.. The reaction was then heated at 80 °C. After 18 h at 80 °C, the reaction was allowed to cool to rt, quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (50 mL) and concentrated in vacuo. The remainder was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL). The combined extracts were washed with water (2 x 100 mL) and brine (75 mL), then dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the residue by flash column chromatography on silica gel (2% EtOAc/Hex) afforded 7.5 g (93%) of the title compound.<br>

Biological Assay Methods Binding Data<br>
Ki<br>
Competition binding experiments were performed in a medium containing Hank's balanced salt solution,<br>
Mepes 20 mM, pH 7.3, membranes (-60 µg protein) or 2xl05 cells from HEK 293 cells stably expressing human KP2 receptors, [3H]PGE2 (10 nM) and various concentrations of test compounds in a total volume of 300 ul. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 60 min, and were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum. filters were washed three times with 5 ml ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.3). Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of excess unlabeled PGE2 (10 uM). Binding data fitted to the binding model for a single class of binding sites, using nonlinear regression analysis. 1C50 values thus obtained were converted to Ki using the equation of Ki=(lC50/(1+ H [L]/KD) where [L] represents PGE2 concentration (10 nM) and KD the dissociation constant for [3H]PGE2 at human EP2 receptors (40 nM). Radioiigand Binding Cells Stably Expressing EP1, EP2. EP4 and FP Receptors<br>
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP1, EP2, or EP4 receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 1035 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRlS base, 20 mM MgCl2, 2M EDTA; 10N HC1 is added to achieve a pH of 7.4).<br>
The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4° C using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay, Radioiigand binding competition assays vs. [3H-]17 -phenyl PGF2α (5 nM) were performed in a 100µl volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-cold TRlS-HC1 buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer and oven dried for one hour.<br>
[3H-] PGE2 (specific activity 180 Ci mmol) was used as the radioligand for EP receptors. [3H] 17-phenyl PGF2α was employed for FP receptor binding studies. Binding studies employing EPb EP2, EP4 and FP receptors were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. A 200|il assay volume was used. Incubations were for 60 min at 25°C and were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM TRIS-HCl, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and three additional 4 ml washes in a cell harvester (Brandel). Competition studies were performed using a final concentration of 5 nM [3H]-PGE2, or 5 nM [3H] 17-phenyl PGF2α and non-specific binding determined with 10-5M of unlabeled PGE2, or 17-phenyl PGF2α, according to receptor subtype studied METHODS FOR FL1PR™ STUDIES<br>
(a)	CELL CULTURE<br>
HEK-293(EBNA) cells, stably expressing one type or subtype of recombinant human prostaglandin receptors (prostaglandin receptors expressed: hDP/Gqs5; hEP1; hEP2/Gqs5; hEP3A/Gqi5; hEP4/Gqs5; hFP; hlP; hTP), were cultured in 100 mm culture dishes in high-glucose DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM 1-glutamine, 250 ug/ml geneticin (G418) and 200 ug/ml hygromycin B as selection markers, and 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 0.25 ug/ml amphotericin B.<br>
(b)	CALCIUM SIGNAL STUDIES ON THE FL1PR™<br>
Ceils were seeded a! a density of 5 x 104 cells per well in Biocoat® Poly-D-lysine-coated black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates (Becton-Dickinson) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37 °C. Cells were then washed two times with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using a Denley Celiwash plate washer (Labsystems). After 45 minutes of dye-loading in the dark, using the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4 AM at a final concentration of 2 µM, plates were washed four times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye leaving 100 µl in each well. Plates were re-equilibrated to 37 °C for a tew minutes.<br>
Cells were excited with an Argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was measured through a 510-570 nm bandwidth emission filter (FLIPR™, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Drug solution was added in a 50 fxl volume to each well to give the desired final concentration. The peak increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded for each well. On each plate, four wells each served as negative (HBSS-HEPES buffer) and positive controls (standard agonists: BW245C (hDP); PGE2 (hEP,; hEP2/Gqs5; hEP3A/Gqi5; hEP4/Gqs5); PGF2α (hFP); carbacyclin (hip); U-46619 (hTP), depending on receptor). The peak fluorescence change in each drug-containing well was then expressed relative to the controls.<br>
Compounds were tested in a high-throughput (HTS) or concentration-response (CoRe) format. In the HTS format, forty-four compounds per plate were examined in duplicates at a concentration of 10-5 M. To generate concentration-response curves, four compounds per plate were tested in duplicates in a concentration range between 10-5 and 10-11 M. The duplicate values were averaged. In either, HTS or CoRe format each compound was tested on at least 3 separate plates using cells from different passages to give an n &gt; 3. intraocular Pressure (lOP)<br>
Intraocular pressure studies in dogs involve pneumatonometry performed on conscious Beagle dogs of both sexes (10-15 kg). The animals remain conscious throughout the study and are gently restrained by hand. Drugs are administered topically to one eye as a 25 uL volume drop, the other eye receives 25 µL vehicle (0.1% polysorbate 80 10 mM TRIS) as a control. Proparacaine (0,1%) is used for corneal anesthesia during tonometry. Intraocular pressure is determined just before drug administration and at 2, 4 and 6 hr thereafter on each day of the 5 day study. Drug is administered immediately after the first lOP reading.<br>
