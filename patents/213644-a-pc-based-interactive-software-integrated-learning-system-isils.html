				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  an  electronic communication  system  and  in<br>
particular to a PC based Interactive Software Integrated Learning System (ISILS) which can be used in the development of communication skill especially by way of interactive education / presentations and the like. The system is adapted for fulfilling diverse needs of interactive communication in particular in environments requiring interactive conversation; roll play,, interview, presentation and group discussion. The system is especially useful for interactive language learning by way of a simple and highly interactive yet possible personalized two way communication between the instructor and pupil requiring development of language skills. The communication system is also adapted to benefit students and professionals of diverse fields and activities requiring the effective and interactive communication skills for various purposes. The system is simple and cost effective and can therefore be readily installed and used in various locations to impart the above communicative training/lessons to interested persons / groups.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known to provide communication systems especially interactive communication system to impart instructions to pupil desiring of developing communication / speaking skill/knowledge base by way of interactive learning in groups under instructions from an instructor.<br>
The most common of communication systems available and conventionally developed and used include the presently available communication systems for languages learning.<br>
US 6,024,571 disclose a hand-held, paper-based translation system wherein linguistic content is sequentially displayed to facilitate a step-by-step process for simple sentence-generation and customary conversational exchanges. The system includes literacy-based, phonetic pronunciation. The device, which houses translation data, provides rapid manual and visual accessing.<br>
US 6,341,959 provides yet another method and system for learning a language which takes the language data selected by a learner or a default test base as the learning content and improves the learner's language ability through tests about the<br><br>
learning content. The learner is allowed to arbitrarily update the language data stored in a learning database. The system further contains a grammar analysis engine.<br>
US 6,435,876 teaches a language instructional process. The process includes identifying a word or sentence having sound that is difficult to pronounce or that is often confused. The process also includes training to hear the sound accurately, viewing mouth movement when making the sound, and pronouncing the word or sentence. The process further includes recording the mouth movement when pronouncing the word or sentence, sending a recording of the mouth movement to an instructor, and reviewing a feedback from the instructor.<br>
The above go to show that variety of language learning gadgets have been developed over the years to impart language instructions to people. As would be apparent from the above the language learning communication systems as above were basically directed to improve upon the manner of imparting language education. With the demand for such communication system especially interactive communication system with cost effective gadgets / accessories growing there has also been the need for providing such communication system in a manner which would benefit imparting more scientifically modulated training by way of an effective interactive system which can be advantageously used for group interaction and also said to be personalized as far as taking care of the special and specific needs of the individual participants in such interactive learning.<br>
Importantly, while some systems for communication between an instructor and pupil to be instructed are made available the same mostly involves software run through network of computers and such systems involving plurality of computers necessarily make the system cost-extensive and not suitable for wide scale use and application for interactive communication. Also it is found that even the software-computer interaction in such known systems make its operation complex and time consuming at times thereby further affecting the efficiency and purpose of the interactive communication system. There has been a continuing need in the art to develop interactive communication systems which would on one hand be cost effective and on the other hand be also user friendly thereby making its use and purpose more readily acceptable to the masses, there is also the need to achieve the desired flexibility in audio input and output at the instructors panel and those at various<br>
2<br><br>
workstations provided for pupil receiving the training / course. In particular, it is found that need for systems which would not only favour voice input from the instructor to the pupil but also require that the instructor be provided with the option of forwarding any one of variety of audio inputs such as from a CD player. Tape or AUX-IN to any of the conventional communication outputs such as head phone and public address system.<br>
It is found that most of such conventional communication systems presently in use are built around network of plurality of computers and involve a complex networking of software with the multiple computer units which affects the desired user friendly characteristics of the interactive system. Also it has been difficult to provide cost-effective systems involving a single computer whereby the instructor can pickup any of the users voice and can direct it to other user headphone or the public address system to provide for an efficient yet cost-effective interactive system. Also it is difficult in such single computer and cost effective communication systems to provide for interaction with the instructor or the instructor required to provide special instruction to any of the persons listening to the instructor without disturbing others in the group. It is also found that in case of such communicative system it is important to provide means whereby any of the person receiving instructions can draw the attention for any query concerning the lesson being communicated or the interactive session in progress.<br>
The above therefore reveal the continuing need in the art to develop gadgets / systems of communication whereby it would be readily possible to provide such user friendly means for group interactive communication to make such communication more effective and worthwhile. While the above discussed provisions in a communication system may appear to be of apparent necessity, however, due to complexity in provision of such means for communication as well as the cost of providing of such gadgets such flexibility in communication means/ method are usually not available in the conventional communication systems. There is thus a need in the art to meet such demand of an user friendly and cost effective communication system which would on one hand be cost effective and on the other hand be adapted to meet the diverse needs of such effective communication system.<br>

Reference is first invited to accompanying Figure 1 which shows a basic block diagram of the system of the invention .As shown in said figure the system basically involves a PC which is operatively connected to the I/O card interface (I/O) which connects to the digital block(DB).The digital block is in turn operatively connected to a display (DP) and a switch block (SB).The switch block (SB) is further connected to the respective user/workstation (UR) and also to an analog block (AB).The flow of Analog signal and the digital signals in the above system of the invention is further indicated in the figure.<br>
The constituents of the analog Block (AB) of Figure 1 above is illustrated in greater detail in the accompanying Figure 2.As shown in Figure 2 , the analog block comprises of microphone (MIC) adapted to pick up the voice of user as well as instructor. A pre-amplifier (PAMP) is used since the output of MIC is not sufficient for switching. Accordingly, a pre-amplifier stage is used before switching. After switching, signal is routed as required. The operating circuitry used for the pre-amplification is shown in the accompanying Figure 3.<br>
As shown in the circuitry of Figure 3 a two stage transistorized amplifier is used as a preamplifier. Transistor T1 and T2 form the Mic preamplifier. R1 provides the necessary bias for the condenser MIC while preset VR1 functions as gain control. In order to increase the audio power, the low level audio output from preamplifier stage is coupled via coupling C7 to the audio power amplifier built around an IC via switching.<br>
It is possible to use both the dynamic microphone as well as condenser microphone. The pre-amplifier unit is not same for both condenser microphone and dynamic microphone. Hence a pre-amplifier unit followed by an additional unit is used. The additional unit is bye passed when condenser microphone is used and it includes when dynamic microphone is used in same circuitry. As shown in figure 4 the additional circuit consists of a transistor (T), a capacitor(C) and a resistor(R).<br>
The output of this amplifier is connected to a display driver which displays the output trough a LED bar graph.<br>
10<br><br>
Importantly, since the output of a switch is not sufficient to drive a speaker or a headphone. Hence an amplifier is used to amplify the audio level. The amplifier is based on an IC. It is a low watt audio power amplifier.<br>
Output Level Display (DP) displays the output level of the amplifier whether it is high or low. The Headphone is required to hear the input audio signal from amplifier.<br>
The switching block used in the system comprises of an array of switches required to perform the necessary signal routing. These switches should be digitally controlled. The signal coming from audio block goes to user and instructor after switching.<br>
The digital block generates the required digital control signal to control the switch block. It also receives any pulse given by user. The I/O CARD is used to send the bit pattern to digital block required to generate control signal. The PC is used to interact the instructor with users through software. The control passes from PC to I/O card by software.<br>
The basic block diagram of the switching means used in the system of the invention is discussed hereunder in relation to accompanying Figure 5.<br>
As shown In Figure 5, the system is basically comprised of a central instruction station (CIS) for the instructor and plurality of user/work stations (UWS) for each of the users of the system. Each of the respective user/work stations (UWS) and the central instruction station (CIS) are provided with a microphone (MIC) a preamplifier (PA), a headphone (HP) and an amplifier(AM) ahead of the headphone(HP) .The output signal (from MIC) is first pre-amplified, then delivered to the switching unit (SU) in the central instruction station(CIS).A signal that is a input to the user, is first amplified by his own amplifier and then drive the headphone of the user. A separate audio source (AS) is shown also operatively connected to the switching unit (SW).<br>
The details of the switching unit and its arrangement and possible operative configurations are discussed hereunder in relation to accompanying figures 6 and 7:<br>
11<br><br>
Importantly as shown in said figures the electronically switching is realized here by a well-known CMOS IC. Such ICs are preferably selected to have four identical switches to control analog signal. The switches have a low 'ON' resistance (80 ohm for 15 volt operation) and low resistance is relatively constant over the input signal range. Each switch is electronically controlled (ON or OFF) by a positive voltage (typically for 5 volt supply, the low level input is 2.25 volt and the high level input is 2.75 volt). This IC is used here in 5 volt operation.<br>
In particular the selectively four switches i.e. a single IC is adapted to cater a single user. One switch is used to route the voice of the user to a common channel, from where he can access a signal through an another switch. Through an another switch, the voice of user is routed to instructor amplifier input. User can hear audio by the last switch. All the controls (of the switches) belong to the instructor. All the input (to user) are first amplified after switching and then heard by the user.<br>
As the switches are controlled electronically, four digital lines are required to control a single selective IC. To generate switch control logic , a further IC is used. It is an 8 bit addressable latch, means it has eight addressable output lines. So, using a single IC it is possible to control two ICs of two users i.e. to control eight switch line the required control line reduces to 6 from 8, as 6 input line is used to drive 8 output lines of a switch control logic means. As the number of switches increase (let 8x2=16), the required control lines should be 6+6=12 (to use 2 no. switch control logic means). But putting the address lines, data select line and chip clear line (of both the switch control logic means) are common, the no of control lines reduces to 7 (5+1+1) only. This can be understood more dearly from accompanying Figure 6.<br>
Thus to control 40 no. CD4066, 20 enable lines are required 20 no. switch control logic means are provided. But adding an another stage of switch control logic means , it is possible to decrease the required no. of enable lines. This is explained hereunder in greater detail:<br>
As each switch control logic unit has 8 output lines, so to control 20 lines, minimum 3 no. switch control logic units are required. These switch control logic units are called 2nd stage of switch control logic and the previous stage is called 3rd stage. The input lines (AO, Al, A2, C, D) of the 2nd stage should not be common to the 3rd stage. As the enable lines are active low, all the output from the second stage are<br>
12<br><br>
connected through a hex inverter IC.The arrangement is illustrated in greater detail in accompanying Figure 7.<br>
Hence it would be clearly apparent from Figure 7 that to control 40 no. CMOS ICs, 5 (A0, A1, A2, C, D of first stage) + 5 (A0, A1, A2, C, D of second stage) + 3 (E21, E22, E23) - 13 are required. It is possible to add another stage (first stage) of switch control logic means. In this stage there is a single switch control logic unit and the output of this switch control logic unit (Q0, Q1, Q2) are inversely connected to the enable line of the second stage of switch control logic unit. The common input lines of the 3rd stage switch control logic units are passed through a hex buffer IC.<br>
All these required control bits (to control the several switch control logic units ) are directly driven by an I/O card connected at PCI slot. Preferably, it is a 144 bit I/O card having 3 no. 50 pin IDC connector for interfacing.<br>
As the I/O card have bi-directional lines, it can receive data as well as send data. Hence each fine can sense a user when he presses the push button switch. Actually this line is grounded firstly. Preferably if the end of the I/O line is open, it will automatically sense a signal at that pin without really applying voltage. Hence it is possible to use a resistor normally grounding the input pin. When any one pushes the button, a positive pulse is applied on that input line and the software senses the pulse by glowing a number below of that particular user on priority basis. Figure 8 shows an embodiment of such arrangement.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed interactive communication system to achieve better communication competence. In particular the system can be advantageously used for language learning purposes with more effective and user friendly communication whereby it would be possible to improve the technique of listening skills, impart more flexibility in interactive /communicative options of the instructor/users, demonstrate the skill for communicating in a more assertive manner in all situations, enable identifying mechanism to manage and criticize and also facilitate identifying skills for communicating idea, thought and feelings and meetings diverse challenges in effective communication.<br>
The system is also effective in conducting interview and can impart the feel of actual interview, for group discussions to develop leadership skill to negotiate conflict and<br>
13<br><br>
skill for purposeful and effective delivery of views. The system can also advantageously be used for presenting seminar and useful as a modern communication aid such as multimedia digital slide presenter and internet based training system.<br>
The system can also advantageously be used for imparting interactive use to improve body languages and assert positive gestures and posture while communicating.<br>
The languages learning utility of the system would include effective facilities/provisions such as including reading comprehension correcting grammatical error and vocabulary development. Importantly it can also be used for preparation of technical report and business correspondence including developing writing skill.<br>
