BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved VAD process that enables uniform<br>
deposition of glass microparticles, even when producing a large porous glass preform<br>
2	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The production of a porous preform used to make silicate optical fiber can be<br>
carried out by a variety of methods One well-known example from among these<br>
methods is the VAD method In the VAD method, glass microparticles synthesized by a<br>
core burner are deposited to the end of a vertically supported mandrel as the mandrel is<br>
rotated, and the core soot preform that will form the optical fiber core is developed into a<br>
rod form At the same time, glass microparticles synthesized by the cladding burner are<br>
deposited on the periphery of the core soot preform to form the cladding soot preform that<br>
comprises part or all of the cladding In this way, a porous preform is made The<br>
thus-obtained porous preform is then subjected to high temperature heating, undergoing<br>
dehydration and consolidation to form a transparent glass preform This glass<br>
transparent preform is then drawn to produce the optical fiber<br>
In order to synthesize glass microparticles in the core and cladding burners, raw<br>
material gases such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) and germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4),<br>
fuel gases such as hydrogen, supporting gases such as oxygen to augment burning, and<br>
inert gases such as argon, are supplied In addition, in order to provide the optical fiber<br>
with a refractive index profile, a different composition of raw material gases is supplied to<br>
the core and cladding burners respectively Namely, a dopant such as GeO2 is doped at a<br>
specific concentration to the core portion, thereby providing the optical fiber with a<br>
refractive index profile<br>
In addition, in order to apply a specific refractive index profile to an optical fiber,<br><br><br>
a dopant like GeO2 is applied to the core, and further, the surface temperature of the coie<br>
soot preform is appropriately controlled to add a specific amount of dopant This is<br>
because, depending on the dopant employed, the doping efficiency, 1 e , the dopant<br>
incorporated into the core soot preform, can vary greatly according to the surface<br>
temperature of the core soot preform<br>
Therefore, for example, radiation thermometers are placed around the core soot<br>
preform and the core soot preform surface temperature distribution is measured Based<br>
on these measured values, heating conditions such as the amount of fuel gas supplied to<br>
the core burner and the relative positioning of the core burner and the core soot preform,<br>
and the surface temperature of the core soot preform is controlled, so that the dopant is<br>
incorporated at the desired concentration distribution<br>
In addition, to facilitate measurement, the temperature is generally measured by<br>
placing the radiation thermometers around the lateral direction of the core soot preform<br>
For example, it is disclosed that there is an appropriate core soot preform surface<br>
temperature range when doping GeO2 in the VAD method, in The Transaction of the<br>
Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers, Vol J65-C, No 4, p 292-299,<br>
April, 1982<br>
However, there has been a trend in recent years toward increasing the dimensions<br>
of the porous preform so that optical fiber production costs can be reduced On the other<br>
hand, as the dimensions of the porous preform increase, the outer diameter of the core soot<br>
preform increases As a result, whereas previously the temperature distribution at the<br>
ends of the core soot preform had been roughly constant when depositing the glass<br>
microparticles, variations in temperature that are not negligible arise around the core soot<br>
preform ends due to the larger diameter of the core soot preform<br>
The areas at the core soot preform ends are the most center-positioned regions in<br>
the refractive index profile that forms the optical fiber In order to obtain the desired<br>
characteristics, it is necessary to control the temperature of the surface where the core soot<br>
preform is deposited in this area especially However, when the temperature variations<br>
in this area become large in the core soot preform, this temperature distribution cannot be<br><br><br>
suitably controlled, so that the concentration of the dopant is not uniform As a result,<br>
there is increased variation in the optical fiber characteristics, so that an optical fiber with<br>
stable characteristics cannot be produced When the temperature variation in this area<br>
becomes large, the adhesion and deposition of the glass microparticles becomes<br>
non-uniform along the radial direction, generating a rugged surface in the core soot<br>
preform (referred to as "rugged soot preform" in this specification) As a result, it is not<br>
possible to continue producing the porous preform<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above-described<br>
circumstances and has as its objective the provision of a method for producing a porous<br>
preform in which a dopant can be stably doped to the core soot preform and rugged soot<br>
preform can be prevented<br>
The aforementioned problems are resolved by a method for producing a porous<br>
preform in which the core soot preform is formed by depositing glass microparticles,<br>
synthesized by flame hydrolysis or thermal oxidation of raw material gases expelled from<br>
the core burner, onto the end of the mandrel, while at the same time forming the cladding<br>
soot preform by depositing glass microparticles, synthesized by flame hydrolysis or<br>
thermal oxidation of raw material gases expelled from the cladding burner, around the<br>
core soot preform, wherein the surface temperature distribution at the end of the core soot<br>
preform is measured and the heating conditions by the core burner arc set so that the<br>
temperature Tc at the center point of the end of the core soot preform is in the range of<br>
500 to 1000°C, and more preferably in the range of 600 to 950°C, and that the difference<br>
Tm-Tc between the maximum surface temperature Tm at the core soot preform end and<br>
the surface temperature Tc at the center of the core soot preform end is in the range of 5 to<br>
45°C<br>
The aforementioned problems are also resolved by a method for producing a<br>
porous preform in which the core soot preform is formed by depositing glass<br>
microparticles, synthesized by flame hydrolysis or thermal oxidation of raw mateiial gases<br><br><br>
expelled from the core burner, onto the end of the mandrel, while at the same time forming<br>
the cladding soot preform by depositing glass microparticles, synthesized by flame<br>
hydrolysis or thermal oxidation of raw matenal gases expelled from the cladding burner,<br>
around the core soot preform. in the area at said core soot preform end where the<br>
angle formed by a line extending vertically from the soot preform surface and a line<br>
extending in the normal line direction is 55° or less, the proportion R of the area in which<br>
the surface temperature is higher than the surface temperature Tc at the center point of<br>
said core soot preform end is maintained in the range of 5 to 30%<br>
In this type of porous preform production method, it is desirable to control the<br>
heating conditions in the core burner so that the surface temperature at the end of the core<br>
soot preform is in the above-described range<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be explained in greater detail based on preferred<br>
embodiments thereof Figure 1 shows an example of a manufacturing device for<br>
executing the porous preform production method of the present invention<br>
In Figure 1, reference numeral 1 indicates a mandrel The Mandrel 1 hangs<br>
vertically inside a chamber 2, and can be rotated and moved up and down by a driving<br>
means (not shown in the figures)<br>
A core burner 3 and a cladding burner 4 are disposed inside the chamber 2<br>
Only one cladding burner 4 is shown in Figure 1, however, it is acceptable to provide a<br>
plurality of these as well The core burner 3 and the cladding burner 4 are designed to<br>
synthesize glass microparticles from fuel gases such as hydrogen and supporting gases<br>
like oxygen and material gases such as SiCl4 and GeCl4 that are supplied from a gas<br>
supply source (not shown in the figures)<br>
The glass microparticles synthesized by the core burner 3 are deposited to the end<br>
of the mandrel 1 that is hanging vertically downward, forming a the core soot preform 5a<br>
The glass microparticles that are synthesized by the cladding burner 4 are deposited<br>
around the outer periphery of the core soot preform 5a to form a cladding soot preform 5c<br>
The soot preform 5 consisting of the core soot preform 5a and the cladding soot preform<br>
5c develops in the axial direction to ultimately form the porous preform<br>
The flow of fuel and raw material gases supplied to the core burner 3 can be<br>
adjusted using a flow adjusting device (not shown in the figures) The core burner 3 can<br>
move in a horizontal or vertical direction through a moving means (not shown in the<br>
figures)<br>
First and second radiation thermometers 6a and 6b are provided to the side of and<br>
directly below the core soot preform 5a, respectively First and second radiation<br>
thermometers 6a and 6b are connected to an image processing data recording device 7<br>
The heating conditions for the core burner 3 can be adjusted based on the surface<br><br><br>
temperature distribution at the end 5b and the side surface of the core soot preform 5a that<br>
is measured by the first and the second radiation thermometers 6a and 6b<br>
In these preferred embodiments, the surface temperatuie distribution at the end 5b<br>
of the core soot preform 5a is measured using the manufacturing device shown in Figure 1<br>
and the heating conditions that the core soot preform 5a is subjected to by the core burner<br>
3 are determined based on these measured values<br>
The reason for providing the second radiation thermometer 6b vertically below<br>
the core soot preform 5a is as follows<br>
As discussed above, as the outer diameter of the core soot preform 5a increases,<br>
temperature variations that cannot be ignored begin to occur at the surface of the core soot<br>
preform end 5b However, for the reasons below, it is not possible to ascertain this<br>
temperature variation at the core soot preform end 5b using just the first radiation<br>
thermometer 6a<br>
It is known that in general, the emissivity at the surface of an object depends on<br>
the direction of radiation In other words, as shown in Figure 2, for infrared radiation<br>
radiated from the surface of an object M, when the radiating angle ϕ is defined as the<br>
angle formed by the direction of the radiation and a line normal to the surface of the object<br>
M, then emissivity is roughly constant when ϕ is 55° or less in the case of a porous glass<br>
preform However, when the radiating angle ϕ exceeds 55°, emissivity decreases<br>
remarkably, so that it is not possible to obtain an accurate measurement of temperature at<br>
radiation thermometer 6 (6a and 6b)<br>
Accordingly, in the case where the surface temperature at the end 5 b of the core<br>
soot preform 5a is measured by placing the first radiation thermometer 6a only at the side<br>
of the core soot preform 5 a as in the conventional art, the measurement of the surface<br>
temperature distribution at the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a becomes less precise<br>
since the radiating angle ϕ is large with respect to the first radiation thermometer 6a As<br>
a result, heating conditions are not accurately controlled To solve this problem, the<br>
second radiation thermometer 6b is provided vertically below soot preform 5<br>
In order to determine the extent to which the positions of first and second<br><br>
ladiation thermometers 6a and 6b affect the measurement of the surface temperature at the<br>
end 5b of the core soot preform 5a, the present inventors measured the surface temperature<br>
distribution at the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a using the first and the second<br>
radiation thermometers 6a and 6b m the manufacturing device shown in Figure 1 As a<br>
result, an approximately 200°C or greater difference was discovered between the<br>
measured value at the first radiation thermometer 6a positioned at the side of the core soot<br>
preform 5a and second radiation thermometer 6b positioned vertically below the core soot<br>
preform 5a<br>
Accordingly, it was considered that the surface temperature distribution at the end<br>
5b of the core soot preform 5a could be accurately measured by placing the second<br>
radiation thermometer 6b vertically below the core soot preform 5 a<br>
An example of the method for adjusting the heating conditions by the core burner<br>
3 based on the measured values of the surface temperature distribution will now be<br>
explained<br>
Figure 3 is an example of the surface temperature distribution at the end 5b of the<br>
core soot preform 5a that was measured using second radiation thermometer 6b In this<br>
example, the center point c on the end 5 b of the core soot preform 5 a shown in Figure 1<br>
corresponds to the center of the surface temperature distribution In the example shown<br>
in Figure 2, the temperature at the position m where the temperature increases, is denoted<br>
as Tm As the distance from this point increases, the surface temperature drops, so that<br>
an isothermal line is described that is centered on m<br>
When adjusting the heating conditions by the core burner 3 based on the surface<br>
temperature distribution at the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a, a method may be<br>
proposed which satisfies conditions such as<br>
(1) the surface temperature Tc at the center point c on the end 5b of the core soot<br>
preform 5a is in the range of 500 to 1000°C, and preferably in the range of 600 to 950°C,<br>
and the difference Tm-Tc between the maximum surface temperature Tm at the end 5b of<br>
the core soot preform 5a and the surface temperature Tc at the center point c on the end 5b<br>
of the core soot preform 5a is m the range of 5 to 45°C, and<br><br><br>
(2) the ratio R of the area in which the surface temperature at the end 5b of the core<br>
soot pieform 5a is higher than the surface temperature Tc at the center point c on the end<br>
5b of the core soot preform 5a is in the range of 5 to 30%<br>
By using any of these conditions, a dopant such as GeO2 can be stably doped<br>
In particular, it is preferable to adjust the heating conditions so as to satisfy all these<br>
conditions<br>
When these conditions arc not satisfied, the dopant cannot be stably doped. Accordingly,<br>
this is not desirable as there is a large amount of variation along the longitudinal direction<br>
of the refractive index profile of the porous preform, and rugged soot preform occurs<br>
As described above, the amount of a dopant such as GeO2 that is doped will vary<br>
according to the surface temperature of the core soot preform 5a in the doped area In<br>
particular, when the surface temperature exceeds 1000°C, the vapor pressure of the GeO2<br>
increases, so that the amount doped to the core soot preform 5a becomes extiemely<br>
unstable Further, the bulk density of the core soot preform 5a increases, so that the<br>
subsequent dehydrating process tends to be insufficient<br>
In the area at the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a, the center c of the end 5b of<br>
the core soot preform 5a is the same as the center of a rotation of the mandrel 1 When<br>
the center c of the core soot preform end and position m, where the temperature is<br>
maximal, coincide, positional variations arising from rotation do not occur Thus, local<br>
concentration of the dopant can readily increase Under these circumstances, the<br>
concentration of the dopant can vary dramatically in the area around the center of the core<br>
soot preform end 5b For this reason, even slight variations in pioduction conditions<br>
caused by a disturbance of some sort can result in rapid changes in the concentration of the<br>
dopant<br>
On the other hand, the amount of glass microparticles deposited on the core soot<br>
preform 5a also depends on the surface temperatuie of the core soot preform 5a When<br>
the tempeiature is high, the space surrounding the glass microparticles is small, while<br>
when the temperature is low, the space around the glass microparticles is larger In other<br><br><br>
words, the bulk density and the volume of the glass microparticles deposited varies<br>
depending on temperature variations For this reason, when the temperature gradient<br>
becomes too large in the radial direction of rotation at the end 5b of the core soot preform<br>
5a, the volume of adhered glass microparticles becomes non-uniform in the radial<br>
direction, resulting in rugged soot preform<br>
Examples of the heating conditions in the core burner 3 that are applied to the<br>
core soot preform 5a include the flow volume of fuel gases such as hydrogen and<br>
supporting gases such as oxygen, and the relative positioning of the core burner 3 and the<br>
end 5 b of the core soot preform 5 a<br>
If heating conditions such as these are preset using test runs prior to producing the actual<br>
product, then these conditions can be adjusted prior to manufacture of the product so that<br>
the porous preform can be produced with these conditions held constant during production<br>
As a result, these conditions do not have to be controlled or varied during production, so<br>
that production is facilitated<br>
It is also acceptable to employ a suitable control device to control the heating<br>
conditions by suitably varying them during operation<br>
In addition, it is also acceptable to first produce a porous preform by holding the heating<br>
conditions constant, and then, when the surface temperature conditions at the core soot<br>
preform 5 a seem likely to exceed the above-prescribed limits, to then begin controlling the<br>
heating conditions That is, under these circumstances, the heating conditions can be<br>
suitably varied so as to maintain the above-defined range, so that glass microparticles can<br>
be continuously deposited<br>
The following method is available as a method for adjusting the relative<br>
positioning of the end 5 b of the core soot preform 5 a and the core burner 4 For example,<br>
Figure 4 shows the manufacturing device in Figure 1 as seen from below As shown in<br>
Figuie 4, the heating conditions at the core burner 3 can be varied by moving the core<br>
burner 3 in the horizontal direction In addition, by raising or lowering the mandrel 1,<br>
the heating conditions at the core burner 3 can be adjusted<br>
In addition, the core burner 3 can be moved perpendicularly up or down, or can be<br><br><br>
moved toward or away from the core soot preform 5 a<br>
The wavelength measured at the first and the second radiation thermometers 6a<br>
and 6b will depend on the type of radiation thermometer employed Accordingly, there<br>
are no particular restrictions applied to the wavelength Provided that the surface<br>
temperature distribution at the core soot preform 5a can be measured with good accuracy,<br>
then the measurement can be conducted using the wavelengths employed in the usual<br>
radiation thermometer For example, a 3 0 to 5 3 urn band may be adopted in order to<br>
eliminate absorption by the moisture vapor in the air or flame emitted from the core burner<br>
j&gt;<br>
In this embodiment, the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a is the area on the core<br>
soot preform 5 a in which the radiation angel ϕ with respect to the second radiation<br>
thermometer 6b positioned perpendicularly below the core soot preform 5a is 55° or less<br>
As a result of this design, the surface temperature distribution at the end 5b of the core<br>
soot preform 5a can be measured by the second radiation thermometer 6b, thereby further<br>
simplifying the device design<br>
In this case, as shown in Figure 5, since second radiation thermometer 6b is<br>
located perpendicularly below the core soot preform 5a, radiating angle ϕ at an optional<br>
point P on the surface of the core soot preform 5a is equal to angle 6 formed between the<br>
tangential and horizontal planes at point P Accordingly, when determining the end 5b of<br>
the core soot preform 5a, the contour of the end 5b of the core soot preform 5a is<br>
measured using a CCD camera from the side of the core soot preform 5a, and the end 5b<br>
can be determined using image processing of the measured contour<br>
As in the case of the conventional art, a porous preform formed according to this<br>
embodiment can be formed into an optical fiber by drawing after heating and<br>
transparent-vitrifying<br>
Next, the present invention will be explained using examples A porous preform<br>
was produced using the manufacturing device shown in Figure 1<br>
The wavelength measured by the first and the second radiation thermometers 6a<br>
and 6b, was in the range of 3 0 to 5 3 µm A multi-pipe bumei having supply ports for<br><br><br>
hydrogen, oxygen and argon provided in stratification around the supply ports for the raw<br>
material gases were employed as the core burner 3 The flow rates of oxygen gas, SiCl4,<br>
GeCl4, and argon were 21 liters/minute, 1 8 liters/minute, 0 12 hters/minute, and 8 2<br>
liters/minute, respectively<br>
The flow rate of hydrogen gas supplied to the core burner 3 was varied in the<br>
range of 19 to 37 liters/minute Heating conditions of the soot preform end 5b were<br>
varied by moving the core burner 3 and the core soot preform 5a relative to one another<br>
By varying the heating conditions of the core burner 3, the relative position<br>
coordinates of point m with respect to point c in the surface temperature distribution<br>
shown in Figure 3 was varied in the range of 0 to 1 8 mm for the X coordinate and -2 2 to<br>
-0 2 mm for the Y coordinate<br>
Glass microparticles were deposited under these respective conditions, to produce<br>
a plurality of porous prefomis with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 700 mm Then,<br>
the porous preforms were heated to form the transparent glass preforms In order to<br>
investigate the variation along the longitudinal direction of the specific refractive index<br>
difference A for these transparent glass preforms, 12 measurement points were set at equal<br>
intervals along the longitudinal direction using a preform analyzer, the specific refractive<br>
index difference A was measured and the variations in these measurements were<br>
calculated<br>
Figure 6 is a graph showing an example of the relationship between A variation<br>
and Tc when Tc is varied<br>
Figure 7 is a graph showing an example of the relationship between Tm-Tc and A<br>
variation when Tm-Tc is varied<br>
Figure 8 is a graph showing an example of the relationship between R and A<br>
variation when R is vaned<br>
In Figures 6 to 8, the mark [♦] indicates cases where a porous preform could be<br>
produced in which no rugged soot preform occurred, and indicates the value of the A<br>
variation shown on the vertical axis The mark [•] indicates cases where rugged soot<br>
preform occurred When rugged soot preform occurred, production of the porous<br><br><br>
pieform was halted, and the A variation of the transparent glass preform was not<br>
measuied<br>
As is clear from these results, when 500°C ≤ Tc ≤ 1000°C, 5°C ≤ Tm-Tc ≤ 45°C,<br>
and 5% ≤ R ≤ 30%, ∆ variation could be held to a small value of 0 05% or less and it was<br>
possible to prevent rugged soot preform from occurring<br>
In addition, glass microparticle deposition was carried out from the beginning after<br>
setting the heatmg conditions at the core soot preform end so that 500°C ≤ Tc ≤ 1000°C,<br>
5°C s Tm-Tc ≤ 45°C, and 5% ≤ R ≤ 30%, to fonn a porous preform having a diameter of<br>
200 mm and a length of 700 mm As a result, a porous preform could be produced in<br>
which the A variation in the specific refractive index difference over the entire length was<br>
small, and the occurrence of rugged soot preform could be prevented<br>
Of course when there occurs a concern that the values of Tc, Tm-Tc, and R<br>
during deposition of the glass microparticals may have deviated outside the ranges of<br>
500°C ≤ Tc ≤ 1000°C, 5°C ≤ Tm-Tc ≤ 45°C, and 5% ≤ R ≤ 30%, it is acceptable to<br>
continue to deposit the glass microparticles by controlling and suitably varying the heatmg<br>
conditions at the core soot preform end so as to maintain the above-prescribed range It<br>
goes without saying that in this case as well, excellent results can be obtained<br>
As explained above, as a result of the production method of the present invention<br>
for a porous preform, it is possible to control variations in characteristics along the length<br>
of the fiber minimum, so that a superior optical fiber can be produced In addition,<br>
rugged soot preform can be prevented and productivity can be improved<br><br><br>
