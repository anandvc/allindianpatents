				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an acoustic and thermal insulation member and a process for the manufacture of the same.<br>
The members obtained by the process proposed herein are rigid or semi-rigid in construction, as may be desired, for use as panels for acoustic and thermal insulation applications.<br>
Conventionally, glass wool insulation members are produced by the "pot and marble" process involving the melting of glass spheres or marbles in a "pot". The molten glass flows through a series of orifices forming thick, primary strands which are exposed to a supersonic jet of high temperature flame. The strands are thus attenuated or formed into fine fibres wYiicTn are sprayed with a binder and are collected on a moving belt. The resulting blanket is cut to length, placed between moulds at high temperature and pressed to form the finished product.<br>
As stated above, conventionally, the manufacture of  the  insulating  member  commences  from   the<br><br>
manufacture of glass wool and ends with the finished product as one continuous process. Consequently, such members are usually made by glass wool manufacturers, since the process of manufacture of such members is a continuation of the process for the manufacture of glass wool itself.<br>
On the other hand, the process herein uses glass wool as the starting material for the process, along with possible selectable alternatives, as hereinafter described. The steps in the process proposed herein are also different from those of the known art as briefly described above, inasmuch as the process proposed herein is based on the re-resination of glass wool (which is already treated with a thermosetting resin during its manufacture), whenever glass wool happens to be the starting material or one of the starting materials.<br>
Another feature of this invention is that, as stated above, the starting material is selected from  glass  wool, rock wool,  mineral  wool,  and<br><br>
felt. This flexibillty in choice, depending upon the application and the requirements of insulation as pertaining to specific cases is an advantage of this invention.<br>
Furthermore, the process proposed herein is simple and convenient in carrying out, with low overheads even when contemplating mass manufacture.<br>
The process, according to this invention,  for the manufacture of an acoustic and thermal  insulation member, according to this invention, comprises the selection of  at least one material from glass wool,  rock wool, mineral wool, felt; cutting  the said  material to the desired size;  dissolving a thermosetting   resin  in  an   organic   solvent; thorougfhly  wetting the  said" sized"    material"  (i) with either water or the said solvent or (ii) with water  and thereafter  with  the  said   solvent; impregnating  the wet, sized  material  with  the resin solution; hot-pressing the said impregnated, sized,    material  to  the  desired   shape   and thereafter  curing  the same.<br><br>
A preferred thermosetting resin for use  in  the<br>
process proposed herein is phenol  formaldehyde,<br>
although  the use of other resins  categorised  as<br>
epoxy resins, polyester resins is possible.<br>
Organic solvents which dissolve the resin are used. Suitably acetone or ethanol are the preferred solvents for use with phenol formaldehyde .<br>
The solvent to resin ratio depends on the characteristics of the end product to be obtained, but generally the solvent to resin ratio of 20:1 by weight is preferred.<br>
Preferably,  the hot-pressing is carried out at  a temperature between  80 deg. C - 250 deg. C. under 0.5 to 5 bar pressure for a duration of up to 2 hours to complete the curing process.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
To obtain an insulating member with density of 80 kg/cubic metre and thickness of 25 mm. and an area  of<br><br>
30 cm X 30 cm, 5 numbers of glass wool pieces with<br><br>
an area of 30 cm. x 30 cm. and thickness of 25 mm. are cut. Jhe density of glass wool was taken as 16 kg./ cubic metre. All the glass wool layers are stacked together and thoroughly impregnated with acetone.<br>
50 g of phenol formaldehyde resin was taken and mixed with 200 g of acetone. Antimony trioxide and alumina trihydrate which are fire resistant and electric insulating agents are added to the resin solution and mixed therewith, to confer fire retardant and electric insulating characteristics on the final product. This is an optional step which is included in the process whenever fire retardant and electrical insulation properties are required for the final product.<br>
The resin solution, thus obtained, is used for uniformly impregnating the glass wool by spraying or by dipping the wool in the solution. Excess solution is squeezed out.<br>
Hot-pressing of the impregnated glass wool is carried  out under 2.5 bar  pressure,  temperature<br><br>
125 deg. C for a period of 90 minutes to obtain the final cured product.<br>
The Example set out above can also be carried out by stacking all the glass wool layers together and thoroughly wetting the same with water, before carrying out the subseguent step of impregnation with the resin solution.<br>
Alternatively, the said Example can also be carried out by stacking all the glass wool layers together, thoroughly wetting the same with water and thereafter thoroughly impregnating the same with acetone, before carrying out the subsequent step of impregnation with the resin solution.<br>
By   the   process  proposed   herein   there   is substantial   possibility  of  tailoring   the functional  parameters such as density,  porosity, geometry,   sound/thermal  Insulation  efficiency apart  from the ability to obtain uniformity and consistency of parameters.<br>
The density of the final product is controlled  by the*degree of pressing or compaction.<br><br>
The porosity of the final product is controlled by i<br>
the pressure applied and the amount of resin used, since resin has a binding effect.<br>
The flexibility (which is the same as the degree of rigidity) of the final product is controlled by the amount of resin used.<br>
The final product is, preferably, given a good outward appearance by adhesively bonding a facing material on the surface thereof such as gauze or bandage cloth, banian cloth, glass fabric, perforated wooden board, which material also serves to protect the surface of the product from abrasion and other similar damage.<br>
The terms and expression in this specification are of  description and not of  limitation,  having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
