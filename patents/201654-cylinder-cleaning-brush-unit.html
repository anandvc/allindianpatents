				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a cylinder cleaning brush unit including a brush roller for cleaning a cylinder in an offset printing press, paper making machine, paper converting machine, textile machinery or the like. The cylinder includes an outer surface to which impurities are adhered. The impurities are removed from the outer surface by the brush roller with cleaning liquid being supplied.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
For example, impurities such as ink and powdered paper are adhered to the outer surface of a cylinder in an offset printing press or other printing press. It is therefore required to clean the cylinder at intervals to keep each of printed products having a good quality.<br>
Under the circumstances, there has heretofore been proposed a cylinder cleaning apparatus including a brush unit 2 which comprises a brush roller 4 for cleaning a cylinder 6, as shown in Fig. 27. The brush roller 4 is disposed between and mounted on side frames 8 for rotation to be brought into contact with the cylinder 6 at a contact position P, the brush roller 4 extending parallel to the cylinder 6. In addition, the brush roller 4 is connected to a drive such as a motor 10, as shown in Fig. 28, and rotated clockwise in Fig. 27 by the drive 10 to clean the cylinder 6 which is rotated counterclockwise in Fig. 27 at a speed different from the brush roller 4. The cylinder 6 includes an outer surface to which impurities are adhered, the impurities being removed from the outer surface by the brush roller 4 with cleaning liquid being supplied. The cleaning liquid may comprise solvent and<br>
- 1A-<br><br>
water. For example, nozzles 12 are mounted on a cross frame 14 to spout the solvent and water which are directed to the brush roller 4 and the cylinder 6 by a cover plate 16 and a hood 18. The cross frame 14 is disposed between and mounted on the side frames 8 to extend longitudinally of the brush roller 4.<br>
The apparatus is accompanied with effluent including the cleaning liquid and impurities and discharged from the brush unit 2. In this connection, a tray 20 is disposed beneath the brush unit 2 so that the effluent can be discharged from the brush unit 2 to be received in the tray 20. The tray 20 may include an outlet or drain port 22 formed in the bottom thereof, the effluent being discharged from the outlet port 22. In addition, the apparatus includes a flipper bar 24 supported by a stay 26 and brought into contact with the brush roller 4. The effluent is flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24. The stay 26 is disposed between and mounted on the side frames 8 to extend longitudinally of the brush roller 4.<br>
However, in the apparatus in which the tray 20 does not include the outlet port 22, an operator has to detach and convey the tray 20 from the apparatus whenever the tray 20 is filled with the effluent to pour the effluent into a receptacle from the tray 20 without spilling the effluent. In addition, it is required to clean the tray 20 of sludge grown from the effluent. The operator is therefore forced to do dirty work taking labours and times- The work is very hard especially in the apparatus including many brush units.<br>
On the other hand, as to the tray 20 which includes the outlet port 22, a drain pipe is generally connected to the outlet port 22 to drain the effluent into a receptacle from the tray 20 through the drain pipe. However, the drain pipe may be clogged with sludge grown from the<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
effluent and adhered to and deposited on the inner surface of the drain pipe. In this case, the effluent can overflow the tray 20 due to lack of drainage. Accordingly, the operator is required to clean the drain pipe clogged with the sludge, taking labours and times. It may be required to exchange the drain pipe by a new one<br>
Furthermore, the cross frame 14 is splashed with the effluent flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24 so that sludge can be grown from the effluent and adhered to and deposited on the cross frame 14. It is therefore required to clean the cross frame 14 of sludge.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a new and improved cylinder cleaning brush unit and cylinder cleaning apparatus, to thereby overcome the above problems.<br>
Other object of the invention is to liberate an operator from dirty work taking labours and times for maintenance to improve efficiency, safety and productivity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a cylinder cleaning apparatus including a brush unit 2 which comprises a brush roller 4 for cleaning a cylinder 6 according to the invention. The brush roller 4 is disposed between and mounted on side frames for rotation to be brought into contact with the cylinder 6 at a contact position P, the brush roller 4 extending parallel to the cylinder 6, as in the case of the apparatus of Fig, 21.   In addition, the brush roller 4 is rotated in a rotating direction to clean the cylinder 6. In the embodiment, the brush roller 4 is rotated clockwise in Fig. 1 by a drive such as a motor to clean the cylinder 6 which is rotated counterclockwise at a speed different from the brush roller 4, as also in the case of the apparatus of Fig. 27. It should therefore be recognized that the brush roller 4 and the cylinder 6 are rotated downwardly at the contact position P. The cylinder 6 includes an outer surface to which impurities are adhered, the impurities being removed from the outer surface by the brush roller 4 with cleaning liquid being supplied.<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
The brush roller 4 may be rotated reversely to clean the cylinder 6.<br>
The brush unit 2 further includes a spray bar or nozzles 12 for spouting the cleaning liquid comprising solvent and water which are directed to the brush roller 4 and the cylinder 6 by a cover plate 16 and a hood 18, as also in the case of the apparatus of Fig. 27. In addition, a flipper bar 24 is disposed downstream of the contact position P in the rotating direction of the brush roller 4 and brought into contact with the brush roller 4. The flipper bar 24 is supported by a stay 26 disposed between and mounted on the side frames to extend longitudinally of the brush roller 4. The effluent is therefore flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24.<br>
The brush unit 2 further includes an opening 28 formed therein. Effluent is discharged from the brush unit 2 through the opening 28, the effluent including the cleaning liquid and the impurities. The opening 28 is formed downstream of the flipper bar 24 in the rotating direction of the brush roller 4. The brush unit 2 further includes a filter 30 disposed and installed in the opening 28 so that the effluent can be filtrated by the filter 30. The filter 30 is made of a woven or nonwoven fabric, net or perforated film. The fabric should be composed of synthetic fibers, natural fibers, metal wires or the mixture thereof to be free of oil impregnation, oil absorbency, lipophilic, water impregnation, water absorbency and hydrophilic.<br>
The apparatus further includes a tray 20 disposed beneath the brush unit 2 so that the effluent can be discharged from the brush unit 2 to be received in the tray 20, as also in the case of the apparatus of Fig. 27. The tray 20 includes a bottom in which an outlet port 22 is formed. An additional tray 32 is disposed under the outlet port 22 so<br>
-10-<br><br>
that the effluent can be discharged from the outlet port 22 to be received in the additional tray 32. The additional tray 32 includes a bottom in which an outlet port 34 is formed. A drain pipe can therefore be connected to the outlet port 34 to drain the effluent into a receptacle from the additional tray 32 through the drain pipe.<br>
Accordingly, in the apparatus, the effluent can be received in the tray 20 after it is filtrated by the filter 30. The effluent is then received in the additional tray 32 and directed into the drain pipe. As a result, no sludge can be grown from the effluent received in the tray 20 and the additional tray 32 after it is filtrated by the filter 30. It is therefore not required to clean the tray 20 and the additional tray 34 of sludge. In addition, no sludge can be grown from the effluent and adhered to and deposited on the inner surface of the drain pipe, the drain pipe being not clogged with sludge. It is therefore not required to clean the drain pipe of sludge. The operator is not forced to do dirty work taking labour and times. It is also not required to exchange the drain pipe by a new one.<br>
Furthermore, the apparatus includes a cover frame or cross frame 14 disposed opposite to the, cylinder 6 with respect to the brush roller 4. The spray bar 12 is mounted on the cover frame 14 which is disposed between and mounted on the side frames to extend longitudinally of the brush roller 4, as in the case of the cross frame 14 of Fig. 27. In addition, the cover frame 14 includes a curved surface 36 extending along the periphery of the brush roller 4.<br>
-11 -<br><br>
The brush roller 4 is brought into contact with the curved surface 36 in an angular range A. The brush roller 4 can therefore be rotated in the rotating direction to clean the curved surface 36 of the cover frame 14 even if sludge will be grown from the effluent and adhered to the curved surface 36. The   brush<br>
-11A-<br><br>
roller 4 may be close to the curved surface 36 in the angular range A to clean the curved surface 36. Accordingly, no sludge can be deposited on the curved surface 36. The operator is therefore not required to clean the curved surface 36 of sludge.<br>
The cover frame 14 further includes an inclined surface 38 extending downwardly from the lower edge of the curved surface 36 to be inclined away from the cylinder 6 with respect to a vertical plane. The curved surface 36 and the inclined surface 38 are disposed downstream of the flipper bar 24. Sludge is therefore not adhered to and deposited on the inclined surface 38 but moved down along the inclined surface 38 to be dropped onto the filter 30 when the inclined surface 38 is splashed with the effluent flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24. The operator is not required to clean the inclined surface 38 of sludge.<br>
The brush roller 4 is rotated about a center line extending along a vertical plane. The flipper bar 24 is disposed near the vertical plane so that the effluent can be flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24 to be directed into the openirtg 28.<br>
The filter 30 may be installed in the opening 28 to extend the vicinity of a tangent L which extends tangentially to the brush roller 4 and the cylinder 6 at the contact position P, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, the effluent can be filtrated by the filter 30 even if flipped from the brush roller 4 brought into contact with the cylinder at the contact position P to be directed to the vicinity of the tangent L. The effluent is then received in the tray 20 after filtrated by the filter 30.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Fig, 3, the filter 30 is received and supported by a receiver 40 which comprises a perforated<br>
-12-<br><br>
plate mounted on a pivotal member 41 for pivotal movement thereabout. The receiver 40 may comprise comb-shaped member or net. The effluent is discharged from the brush unit 2 through the opening 28 which is formed between the flipper bar 24 the stay 26 and the cover frame 14, to be filtrated by the filter 30. The effluent then passes through the receiver 40 after filtration, to be received in the tray 20 and discharged from the outlet port 22. The filter 30 and the receiver 40 extend toward the stay 26 to be inclined downwardly with respect to a horizontal plane to keep the cover frame 14 being not splashed with the effluent flipped from the brush roller 4 by the flipper bar 24.<br>
In the embodiment, the filter 30 comprises a continuous web held by and fed from a holder which comprises a core 42 about which the filter 30 is wound so that a supply roll 44 can be formed by the filter 30 the core 42 being disposed between and mounted on the side frames for rotation. The filter 30 may be arranged to be held by and fed from a holder other than the core 42. The stay 26 has a reversed U-shaped channel cross section in which an inside space is formed, the filter 30 being held by the holder to be accommodated in the inside space. The brush unit 2 further includes a take up means comprising a take up shaft 46 disposed at the back of the cover frame 14 for taking up the used filter 30. The take up shaft 46 may be rotated manually or automatically to take up the used filter 30.<br>
The filter 30 may comprise a sheet.<br>
The receiver 40 may comprise a perforated plate having perforations 47, as shown in Fig. 4.   The   receiver 40 may include a wave-shaped   surface<br>
-13-<br><br>
having valley portions in which the perforations 47 are formed, as shown in Fig. 5. The plate 30 may take the form of stairs having horizontal steps 48 in which the perforations 47 are formed, as shown in Fig. 6. The filter 30 may comprise fabric, net or perforated film by which the surface of the plate is covered. In this case, the filter 30 may further comprise lubricant for lubricating the surface of the plate to prevent the fabric, net or perforated film from being adhered to the plate. It should be recognized that the adhesion is harmful to the filtration. In addition, the fabric, net or perforated film can be slidingly moved along the plate by the lubricant.<br>
In another embodiment shown in Fig. 7, the filter 30 and the receiver 40 extend horizontally between the lower end portions of the stay 26 and the cover plate 14 which includes the curved surface 36 and the inclined surface 38, as in the case of the apparatus of Fig. 1.<br>
In other embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the filter 30 is directed to a guide member 50 from the supply roll 44. The guide member 50 is mounted on the side frames to extend parallel to the stay 26. The filter 30 is engaged with the guide member 50 to be turned down to the lower side from the upper side thereof. The filter 30 is then directed to the take up shaft 46 from the guide member 50 through a clearance formed between the stay 26 and the receiver 40. The guide member 50 is disposed at the vicinity of the tangent L which extends tangentially to the brush roller 4 and the cylinder 6 at the contact position P so that the filter 30 can be installed in the opening 28 to extend to the vicinity of the tangent L, as in the case of the apparatus of Fig. 2.<br>
-14-<br><br>
In other embodiment shown in Fig. 9, the apparatus includes the tray 20 which includes an opening 52 through which the effluent is discharged from the brush unit 2 to be received in the tray 20.
