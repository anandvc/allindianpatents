1.0 â–  Title of Invention<br>
A tamper-proof, transparent, rotary, seal, requiring no tools for application 2.0   Field of Invention<br>
The invention pertains to field of tamper-proof seals for preventing or checking pilferage of goods or merchandise or utilities and more particularly to tool-less application of seals with conspicuous identification number for the seal applied and name of seal applicant.<br>
3.0	Background of Invention<br>
3.1	There are a few prior works of art reported in the field each of which is described in following paragraphs in comparison to the present invention to highlight their shortcomings, if any, and the dissimilarities to the present invention.<br>
3.2	The US Patent No. 6494508 relates to a seal, wherein the insert is a thin, circular disk of hardened stainless steel that has a plurality of radially, inwardly extending cantilevered fingers that obstruct attempted withdrawal of filament by grip exercised on the filament. The present invention employs neither a solid, hardened stainless steel insert nor a plurality of the cantilevered fingers thereof. It employs, rather, a 7-strand 12 inches long stainless<br><br><br>
steel wire, which gets wound around, after being inserted through a pair of aligned holes, onto its insert.<br>
3.3	In the US Patent No. 6962376, the invention employs a pin with an elongated shaft at its front and an enlarged head at its real ends and retains for locking,, a ring on a pair of aligned grooves. The prior invention has no similarities to the present invention, which engages a 7- strand stainless steel wire on the insert and holds the wire in place by means of a pair of hooks on the ratcheted insert.<br>
3.4	In the invention at patent serial no FR 20040002569, locking is obtained by means of edges that are engaged into notches of a wire inserted into an elongated ring-shaped housing. The present invention employs no notches on the wire, has an insert over which the wire is wound, unlike the prior invention, and is pre-pressed into a cylindrical housing. The present invention substantially differs from the said prior work.<br>
3.5	The U.S. Patent No. 6, 719,335 relates to a lock comprised of a polygonal cross sectioned string secured at one end and advancing at other end longitudinally between openings of a cavity such that the string does not move back longitudinally<br><br>
when nipped in locking action. The present invention employs a 7-strand stainless steel wire, which is wound around insert during rotational movement made during locking. The present invention differs from the said prior work, for if employs winding around the insert of the 7-strand wire.<br>
3.6	The U.S. Patent No. 5,524,945 relates to a one piece plastic seal having a socket body and a flat elongated shackle with circular segment teeth in 2 parallel rows. The present invention-with its pre-pressed insert and a 7-strand wire - substantially differs from the cited earlier work.<br>
3.7	The U.S. Patent 4,241,595 relates to a lock based on a pair of a stationary and a moving transverse pins of which the moving pin is retained, during a locking action, between key plates of the lock. The cited prior work substantially is different from the present invention, which has a 7-strand wire, wound around an insert during a locking action.<br>
3.8	The U, S. Patent no. 6,311, 531 discloses a security strap around retail objects which is locked by spreading apart a pair of asymmetric tines by means of an asymmetric member and closing the tines behind the asymmetric member to form a lock.<br><br>
The present invention substantially differs from the cited prior invention, since it has no pair of asymmetric tines and no imsymmetric member. It has instead a 7-strand stainless steel, wire, wound around an insert pre-pressed in a hovesing.<br>
3.9	The U.S. Patent 5,542,724 discloses an invention comprising a cavity having a pair of openings, separated by base of a tooth. The present invention differs substantially from the cited invention, since if engages a 7-strand stainless wire by means of a rotary movement of an insert on the insert itself in an housing. The prior work has none of these features.<br>
3.10	The U.S. Patent No. 5,772,380 discloses a 2-piece attachment that works on longitudinal alignment of a threaded mounting hole with a retaining screw. Two halves of adjustable attachment device lock together by means of depressions on plug half interlocking into matching sockets on receptable half. For locking action, the adjustable attachment device is freely rotated to intersect the longitudinal axis of the fastner retaining slot with that of the threaded mounting hole. The present inveintion is substantially dissimilar to the prior invention, since it has no interlocking of depressions into receptable half.<br>
4.0	Objects of the Invention :<br>
4.1	An object of the present is to provide a low-cost, tool-less and tamper-proof seal, made of commercially available plastic material.<br>
4.2	Another object of this invention is to integrate conspicuously seal identification and sealant's identity features into the invention.<br>
4.3	Lastly, another twin object of this invention is to render the seal transparent for its integrity and robust to withstand unsheltered weather conditions for a long service span.<br>

7.0	Description of the Invention<br>
7.1	The present invention is comprised of 3 distinct components, namely<br><br><br>
i)     a 7-strand stainless steel wire (10), whose one end is secured<br>
in a housing (20) and whose other end is available for<br>
application of seal to an object.<br>
ii)    a trapezium-shaped housing (20), having a  cylindrical bore<br>
with a radial identification tag (21) at broader upper end<br>
thereof<br>
iii)   an insert (30) with head thereof formed in the shape of a<br>
wing nut (32); The said housing (20) has a hole (22) of about 4 mm diameter at midpoint region thereof on one side thereof, being the side on 90 degrees rotation in clockwise direction from the side having the said radial identification tag (21) and has a pair of holes (23, 23-A) of the said diameter on the side diagonally opposite to the said one side and being the side on 90 degrees rotation in an+:-clockwise direction from the side having the said radial identification tag (21). The said holes (22) and (23) are in perfect horizontal alignment with each other. The said housing has carved to it an uppermost trapezium-shaped, circumferential slot (24) in the entrance region to the said annular cylindrical chamber of .a length of 1-2 mm. The said slot (24) serves as a resting place for the said insert (30) immediately before being pressed into a<br><br><br>
groove (25) below. Below the said slot (24) is carved a hyperbola-shaped, circumferential receptacle groove (25) of length 1.5 mm-2.5 mm, followed by an inverted-trapezium-shaped, circumferentially carved void (26) of about 1 mm length that serves as a buffer zone between the said groove (25) zone and a serial depressions zone (27). The said circumferentially serial 6 no. depressions (27-1, 27-2, 27-3, 27-4, 27-5 and 27-6) of longitudinal length of 3-4 mm are carved in the said housing below the said void (26) such that each of the said depressions flattens out from the radial depth of about 1 mm in anti-clockwise direction to 'zero' radial height at end of its circumferential base length, as shown in the accompanying drawings # 1/4 and # 2/4. The said 6 no. serial depressions facilitate clockwise rotational movement of the said insert (30) but block reverse rotation of the said insert (30) in anti-clockwise direction. The said insert (30) is made of a cylindrical shaft (31), the uppermost end of which has a wing-shaped nut (32), which is rested atop a trapezium-shaped zone (33), having a male twist (33-A) that locks with its counterpart trapezium shaped slot (24) of the said housing (20). Immediately under the said trapezium-shaped zone (33) lies a hyberbola-shaped groove (34-A)<br><br>
that is the male counterpart of the said receptacle groove (25) of the said housing (20). Corresponding to the said circumferential void (26) of the said housing (20), the said shaft (31) is rendered longitudinally to distance the said hyberbola-shaped male groove (34-A) on upstream end of the insert (30) from a pair of hooks (35, 35-A) on the downstream end of the insert (30). The said hook (35), including its identical twin (35-A), is solid circular segment-shaped, covering one side of the said shaft (31) and extending beyond the said shaft (31) in counter-clockwise direction almost up to one end of the periphery of the said hyperbola-shaped, male groove (34), while the said identical twin counterpart hook (35-A) covers the other side of the said shaft (31) and identically extends in counter-clockwise direction beyond the said shaft (31) almost up to the other end of the said periphery of the said hyperbola-shaped male groove (34). The said shaft (31) has longitudinally twin holes (36, 36-A) that are spaced apart with respect to each other and to the said trapezium-shaped male groove (34) as the holes (23, 23-A) of the said housing (20) are with respect to each other and to the said<br><br>
trapezium-shaped slot (24). The said holes (36, 36-A) are separated from each other by a disc-shaped radial partition (37) around the said shaft (31). The said partition (37) longitudinally fits into the void between the corresponding twin holes (23, 23-A) of the said housing (20). 10.     Best Operation of the Invention:<br>
10.1	The insert (30) is pressed into the housing (20) and is freely rotated till the said hole (36) of the insert is perfectly aligned with the said singular hole (22) on one side of the housing (20) and with the upper hole (23) on the other side of the said housing (20).<br>
10.2	The said 7-strand stainless steel wire is passed right through the said aligned 3 holes such that a small length of the dangling said wire (10) is firmly held in hand by seal operator, until the some length already entered in the said housing (20) is wound around -by rotating the said wing-shaped nut (32) in clockwise direction - the said shaft (31) in the form of a few loops - by letting a short length of the said wire (10) being taken in - in the upper chamber formed in the housing (20) that is marked between the said serial depressions at the upper end of the said housing (20) and the partition (37) - filled void of the housing (20).<br><br><br>
10.3	The loose other end of the said wire (10) is wound around object to be sealed and is inserted assuredly in the lower hole (23-A) of the said housing (20).<br>
10.4	The said wing-shaped nut (32-) is rotated in clockwise direction for a few turns to let a short length of the other end of the said wire (10) wound around the said shaft (31) in the form of a few tight loops, formed in the chamber marked at upper side by the said partition (37) - filled void of the housing (20) and the bottom end of the said housing (20).<br>
10.5	The wing of the wing-shaped nut (32-); is sheared off the said nut (3 2-3"   to leave behind a tamper-proof seal on the said object.<br>
