PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to improved nanocomposite compositions and methods for making and using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to inorganic-organic nanocomposites and processes for their preparation. This invention also relates to the use of these inorganic-organic nanocomposite compositions in, for example, coatings, sealants, caulks, adhesives, and plastics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inorganic-organic nanocomposites can exhibit mechanical properties superior to those of their separate components. To optimize the performance properties of these materials, it is usually desirable to disperse the inorganic components in the organic matrix on a nanometer length scale. Clays and other layered inorganic materials that can be broken down into nanoscale building blocks are useful for the preparation of inorganic-organic nanocomposites.<br>
The addition of clay materials to polymers is known in the art, however, incorporating clays into polymers may not provide a desirable improvement in the physical properties, particularly mechanical properties, of the' polymer. This may be due, for example, to the lack of affinity between the clay and the polymer at the interface, or the boundary, between the clay and polymer within the material. The affinity between the clay and the polymer may improve the physical properties of the resulting nanocomposite by, allowing the clay material to uniformly disperse throughout the polymer. The relatively large surface area of the clay, if uniformly dispersed, may provide more interfaces between the clay and polymer, and may subsequently improve the physical properties, by reducing the mobility of the polymer chains at these interfaces. By contrast, a lack of affinity between the clay and polymer may adversely affect the strength and uniformity of the composition by having pockets of clay concentrated, rather than uniformly dispersed; throughout the polymer. Affinity between clays and polymers is related to the fact that Clays, by nature, are generally hydrophillic whereas polymers are generally hydrophobic.<br>
2<br><br>
Clay minerals are typically comprised of hydrated aluminum silicates that are fine grained and have a platy habit. The crystalline structure of a typical clay mineral is a multi-layered structure comprised of combinations of layers of SiO4 tetrahedra that are joined to layers of A1O(OH)2 octahedra. Clay minerals vary based upon the combination of their constituent layers and cations. Isomorphic substitution of the cations of clay mineral, such as Al3+ or Fe3+ substituting for the Si4+ ions in the tetrahedral network, or Al3+, Mg2+ or Fe2+ substituting for other cations in the octahedral network, typically occurs and may impart a net negative charge on the clay structure. Naturally occurring elements within the gallery of the clay, such as water molecules or sodium or potassium cations, are attracted to the surface of the clay layers due to this net negative charge.<br>
In order to promote more affinity between the clay and the polymer at the interface and provide a uniform dispersion of the clay within the polymer, the interlayer surface chemistry of the clay may be modified to render the silicate layers less hydrophilic.<br>
Alkylammonium ions, such as onium salts, are commonly used to prepare clay dispersions for nanocomposite materials. The basic formula for a typical alkyl ammonium ion is CH3-(CH2)n-NH3+ where n is from 1 to 18. It is believed that the alkylammonium ions also readily exchange with the naturally occurring cations present between the clay platelets resulting in an intercalated state. Further, it is believed that the alkylammonium ions may increase the space between the clay layers and also may lower the surface energy of the clay thereby allowing organic species with different polarities to become intercalated between the clay layers.<br>
A need exists for nanocomposites having improved properties. The invention disclosed herein provides a cost effective and efficient process for the production of novel inorganic-organic nanocomposite compositions that are is especially suitable for use in sealants with the desired characteristics of softness, processability and elasticity are important performance criteria.<br>
3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an inorganic-organic nanocomposite is provided which comprises at least one inorganic component which is a layered inorganic nanoparticulate and at least one organic component which is a quaternary ammonium organopolysiloxane.<br>
The novel inorganic-organic nanocomposite of the invention can be used as a filler for a wide variety of polymer resin containing compositions and, in particular, as filler for such compositions intended for application as sealants, coatings and adhesives.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an inorganic-organic nanocomposite is provided comprising at least one inorganic component which is a layered inorganic nanoparticulate and at least one organic component which is quaternary ammonium organopolysiloxane. When describing the invention, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay platelets separate from one another in a polymer matrix. During exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>
The term "intercalant" as used herein includes any inorganic or organic compound capable of entering the clay gallery and bonding to its surface.<br>
4<br><br>
The term "intercalate" as used herein designates a clay-chemical complex wherein the clay gallery spacing has increased due to the process of surface modification. Under the proper conditions of temperature and shear, an intercalate is capable of exfoliating in a resin matrix.<br>
As used herein, the term "intercalation" refers to a process for forming an intercalate.<br>
The expression "inorganic nanoparticulate" as used herein describes layered inorganic material, e.g., clay, with one or more dimensions, such as length, width or thickness in the nanometer size range and which is capable of undergoing ion exchange.<br>
The expression "modified clay" as used herein designates a clay material, e.g., nanoclay, which has been treated with any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
The term "nanoclay" as used herein describes layered clay materials that possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. Nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
As used herein, the term "nanoparticulate" refers to particle sizes, generally determined by diameter, generally less than about 1000 nm.<br>
As used herein, the term "platelets" refers to individual layers of the layered material.<br>
5<br><br>
The inorganic nanoparticulate of the inorganic-organic nanocomposite can be natural or synthetic such as smectite clay, and should have certain ion exchange properties as in smectite clays, rectorite, vermiculite, illite, micas and their synthetic analogs, including laponite, synthetic mica-montmorillonite and tetrasilicic mica.<br>
The nanoparticulates can possess an average maximum lateral dimension (width) in a first embodiment of between about 0.01 µm and about 10 µm, in a second embodiment between about 0.05 (im and about 2 µm, and in a third embodiment between about 0.1 µm and about 1 urn. The average maximum vertical dimension (thickness) of the nanoparticulates can in general vary in a first embodiment between about 0.5 nm and about 10 nm and in a second embodiment between about 1 nm and about 5 nm.<br>
Useful inorganic nanoparticulate materials of the invention include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly smectic clays such as montmorillonite, sodium montmorillonite, calcium montmorillonite, magnesium montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, sobockite, svindordite, stevensite, talc, mica, kaolinite, vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, or hydrotalcites, micaceous minerals such as illite and mixed layered illite/smectite minerals such as rectorite, tarosovite, ledikite and admixtures of illites with one or more of the clay minerals named above. Any swellable layered material that sufficiently sorbs the organic molecules to increase the interlayer spacing between adjacent phyllosilicate platelets to at least about 5 angstroms, or to at least about 10 angstroms, (when the phyllosilicate is measured dry) can be used in producing the inorganic-organic nanocomposite of the invention.<br>
The modified inorganic nanoparticulate of the invention is obtained by contacting quantities of layered inorganic particulate possessing exchangeable cation, e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Mg2+, with at least one arnrnonium-containing organopolysiloxane. The resulting modified particulate is an inorganic-organic nanocomposite possessing intercalated quaternary ammonium organopolysiloxane.<br>
6<br><br>
The ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane must contain at least one ammonium group and can contain two or more ammonium groups. The quaternary ammonium groups can be position at the terminal ends of the organopolysiloxane and/or along the siloxane backbone. One class of useful ammonium-containing organopolysiloxane has the general formula:<br><br>
wherein "a" is 2, and "b" is equal to or,greater than 1 and "c" is zero or positive; M is<br><br>
wherein "a" is 0,1 or 2 and "y" is either 0 or 1, subject to the limitation that x + y is less than or equal to 2, "z" is 2, R1 and R2 each independently is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons; R3 is selected from the group consisting of H and a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons; R4 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons; D is<br><br>
where R5 and R6 each independently is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbon atoms; and D1 is<br><br>
where R7 and R8 each independently is a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing amine with the general formula:<br><br>
wherein "a" is 2, R9 is selected from the group consisting of H and a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons; R10 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the ammonium- containing organopolysiloxane is R11 R12 R13 N, wherein R11, R12, and R13 each independently is<br>
7<br><br>
an alkoxy silane or a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to60 carbons. The general formula for the alkoxy silane is<br>
wherein "x" is 0,1 or 2 and "y" is either 0 or 1, subject to the limitation that x + y is less than or equal to 2; R14 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 30 carbons; R15 and R16 are independently chosen monovalent hydrocarbon groups up to 60 carbons; R17 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group up to 60 carbons, Additional compounds useful for modifying the inorganic component of the present invention are amine compounds or the corresponding ammonium ion with the structure R18 R19 R20 N, wherein R18, R19, and R20 each independently is an alkyl or alkenyl group of up to 30 carbon atoms, and each independently is an alkyl or alkenyl group of up to 20 carbon atoms in another embodiment, which may be the same or different. In yet another embodiment, the organic molecule is a long chain tertiary amine where R18, R19 and R20 each independently is a 14 carbon to 20 carbon alkyl or alkenyl.<br>
The layered inorganic nanoparticulate compositions of the present invention need not be converted to a proton exchange form. Typically, the intercalation of a quaternary ammonium organopolysiloxane into the layered inorganic nanoparticulate material is achieved by cation exchange using solvent and solvent-free processes. In the solvent-based process, the organopolysiloxane ammonium component is placed in a solvent that is inert toward polymerization or coupling reaction. Particularly suitable solvents are water or water-ethanol, water-acetone and like water-polar co-solvent systems. Upon removal of the solvent, the intercalated particulate concentrates are obtained. In the solvent-free process, a high shear blender is usually required to conduct the intercalation reaction. The inorganic-organic nanocomposite may be in a suspension, gel, paste or solid forms.<br>
A specific class of ammonium-containing organopolysiloxanes are those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,130,396 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference<br>

The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting example:<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
An inorganic-organic nanocomposite in accordance with the invention was prepared by first placing 10 g of amino propyl terminated siloxane ("GAP 10/siloxane length of 10, from GE Silicones, Waterford, USA) in a 100 ml single-necked round bottomed flask and adding 4 ml of methanol available from Merck. 2.2 ml of concentrated HCI was added very slowly with stirring. The stirring was continued for 10 minutes. 900 ml of water was added to a 2000 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with condenser and overhead mechanical stirrer. 18 g of Cloisite Na+ (natural montmorillonite available from Southern Clay Products) clay was added to the water very slowly with stirring (stirring rate approximately 250 rpm). The ammonium chloride solution (prepared above) was then added very slowly to the clay-water mixture. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour and let stand overnight. The mixture was filtered through a Buckner funnel and the solid obtained was slurried with 800 ml of methanol, stirred for 20 minutes, and then the mixture was filtered. The solid was dried in oven at 80°C for approximately 50 hours.<br>
