				<td>A METHOD OF MAKING A WEB<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a web, and<br>
more specifically, to an improved formed film for use in body contacting<br>
absorbent and non-absorbent articles such as baby diapers, adult incontinent articles,<br>
sanitary napkins or panty liners, facial wipes, body wipes, articles of clothing,<br>
hospital bed sheets and the like. The absorbent articles usually include a liquid<br>
pervious top sheet and a liquid impervious back sheet. At least one of the<br>
components included in at least one of the top sheet or the back sheet comprises a<br>
formed film of the invention. The invention is directed to the improved articles, the<br>
improved films, the method of forming the formed films, and the apparatus used to<br>
form the films.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
It is known to form three-dimensional films, or formed films, by causing a molten<br>
polymer sheet to conform to the shape of a forming screen. Commonly utilized<br>
apertured formed film top sheets are disclosed in for example, Thompson, U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 3,929,135, Mullane et al., U.S. Patent 4,324,246, Radel et al, U.S.<br>
Patent 4,342,314, Raley et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,252,516, Thomas et al, U.S. Patent<br>
No 4,535,020, Junker et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,591,510, U.S. Application Nos.<br>
09/876440 filed June 6, 2001, and 60/346751 filed January 17, 2002, to Thomas and<br>
U.S. Application No. 10/082040 filed February 20, 2002, to Copal, et al. The<br>
disclosures of each of these documents are incorporated by reference herein in their<br>
entirety. The top sheets disclosed in these documents utilize vacuum, to cause the<br>
polymer sheet to conform to the screen and also to cool. A preferred feature of these<br>
top sheets is that the polymer crystallizes, or "sets," after the molten polymer has<br>
been formed into a three-dimensional shape. The resultant formed film therefore is<br>
said to have "three-dimensional memory." After formation and cooling, the film<br>
usually is wound into a roll.<br>
When the roll is transported, particularly during summer transport and storage in<br>
trucks or non-air conditioned warehouses, web tensions and heat tend to compress<br>
the formed film causing it to temporarily lose some of its valuable three-<br>
dimensionality. The film also is compressed after it is incorporated into an article<br>
and the article is packaged. Three-dimensional memory enables the formed film to<br>
regain its original shape after the non-deforming forces are removed, usually within a<br>
few hours. This capability to resist deformation and to regain three-dimensional<br>
shape is called "resiliency." A disadvantage of these vacuum formed films is that the<br>
fiber-like wires that form the regulated pattern of apertures MAY exhibit a plastic-<br>
like surface and feeling. The plastic-like surface and feeling is viewed negatively by<br>
certain consumers that prefer nonwoven or woven cloth-like surface and feeling.<br>
It also is known to utilize high pressure water jet systems to cause two-dimensional<br>
polymeric webs to conform to forming structures in order to create three-dimensional<br>
webs. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,609,518, 4,629,643, 4,695,422, 4,778,644, and 4,839,216 to<br>
Curro (referred to herein as "the Curro patents" and "the Curro process") describe a<br>
multitude of web designs created by the combination of forming structures and high<br>
pressure water jet systems. The disclosures of each of the Curro patents are<br>
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In the Curro process, pressurized<br>
water is ejected from nozzles projecting water onto the surface of a two-dimensional,<br>
or flat, polymeric web causing the web to conform to the surface of an underlying<br>
support screen. As the screen rotates, subsequent portions of the web pass under the<br>
water jet causing subsequent portions of the web to conform to the screen. One<br>
advantage of the high pressure water systems is that the energy, or work, employed<br>
to force the un-molten web to conform to the screen is believed to soften the web,<br>
therefore water formed films are perceived as being more cloth-like in appearance<br>
and feeling than vacuum formed films.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Curro describes the use of a 1st stage water system that<br>
utilizes a 1st screen comprising micro-apertures to create micro-protuberances in the<br>
film that give the film a soft feeling texture. The micro-apertured or micro-bubbled<br>
film is useful as a back sheet. Subsequently, the film can be passed through a 2nd<br>
stage water system that utilizes a 2nd screen comprising macro-apertures to create<br>
macro-protuberances in the film that give the firm liquid acquisition functionality. In<br>
summary, the 1st stage provides softness and texture, and the 2nd stage provides<br>
apertures for liquid acquisition functionality.<br>
Films produced by the high pressure water jet systems described above are believed<br>
to have several disadvantages, including primarily poor resiliency, or stated<br>
differently, "flat film" memory. Because the precursor films used in high pressure<br>
water jet systems are made flat and then are subsequently made to conform into<br>
three-dimensional shapes, crystallization occurs while the webs are flat, and as a<br>
result the films have flat film memory. Films with flat film memory tend to regain<br>
their flat film shape over time, thereby losing the three-dimensional shape and its<br>
benefits. Another disadvantage of two-stage water jet systems is that the second<br>
stage jets spray water onto 1st stage holes micro-protuberances, thereby damaging<br>
them.<br>
Another disadvantage of the Curro process is that the 1st and 2nd stage system each<br>
require water to penetrate through the screen to form the apertures, thereby requiring<br>
an internal water removal system. These internal systems add complexity and cost,<br>
and increase maintenance requirements, which in turn reduces equipment utilization.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the Curro process is that the two-stage high pressure<br>
water jet systems are expensive to operate — each stage requiring construction of a<br>
screen and procurement of high pressure water, each of which increases cost.<br>
Where the formed films described above are used in a top sheet application, it is<br>
common to incorporate in their formulation a, surfactant. The surfactant will bloom<br>
to the surface of the film over time and will render the film hydrophilic, which is a<br>
desirable property in films designed for fluid acquisition functions. One<br>
disadvantage of the two-stage water process, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,834,092,<br>
5,792,412, and 6,228,462 to Yann-Per Lee, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
by reference herein in their entirety, is that a significant amount of surfactant blooms<br>
to the surface of the web before the web reaches the second stage and such surfactant<br>
is therefore washed away by the water jet. Besides the obvious problems associated<br>
with the loss of surfactant and the fact that there is an upper limit to the amount of<br>
surfactant that can be incorporated in a film, there also is the problem that surfactant<br>
washed away by the water jet builds up in the water system causing it to fail<br>
prematurely or, alternatively, requiring additional cleaning and maintenance efforts.<br>
Surfactant losses are made worse by the application of hot water during the 1st stage,<br>
whereby the heated water increases molecular mobility which in turn accelerates the<br>
blooming rate causing even more surfactant to wash away during the 2nd stage.<br>
One proposed solution to the above problems is the formation of three-dimensional<br>
apertures in nonwoven webs, such as, for example, by spunlacing, needle-<br>
perforation, or embossing systems. Very soft webs can be formed by these<br>
processes. However, the three-dimensional structures of such webs exhibit poor<br>
resiliency because they lack three-dimensional memory.<br>
U.S. Patent No.6,180,052 describes a method for converting a ribbon of<br>
polyethylene film into an apertured formed film. The method includes applying<br>
a high pressure fluid jet comprised of water or the like against one surface of<br>
the film, while applying a vacuum adjacent the opposite surface of the film.<br>
An alternative solution to the above problems is the lamination of nonwoven webs,<br>
apertured or unapertured, or of staple fibers, to vacuum formed films. Such<br>
combinations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,995,930, 5,591,510, 5,635,275,<br>
5,635,276, 5,660,882, 5,698,054, 5,762,643, 5,733,628, 5,783,014, 6,242,074, and<br>
6,303,208. The disclosures of each of these patents are incorporated by reference<br>
herein in their entirety. Very soft and resilient webs can be formed by the lamination<br>
process described therein. However, such webs are expensive to manufacture<br>
because they require preparation of two precursor materials and their subsequent<br>
lamination.<br>
The description herein of disadvantages associated with previous products, methods,<br>
and apparatus is in no way intended to limit the invention to embodiments that do<br>
not include these products, methods, and apparatus. Indeed, certain embodiments of<br>
the invention may include some or all of these previous products, methods, and<br>
apparatus without suffering from the disadvantages noted herein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a feature of an embodiment of the present invention to create a more effective<br>
soft and resilient web. Another feature of an embodiment of the present invention is<br>
to provide an economical method for production of the webs of the invention.<br>
The present invention therefore is directed to an improved method for forming three-<br>
dimensional polymeric webs, to the improved soft and resilient webs made thereby,<br>
and to body-contacting articles comprising as one of their components the improved<br>
soft and resilient webs.<br>
In accordance with these and other features of various embodiments of the invention,<br>
there is provided a single-stage forming, texturing and softening process for making<br>
a soft and resilient formed film. In the process of the invention, a molten polymer<br>
sheet, or a reheated precursor web, is placed in contact with an apertured rotating<br>
screen under the influence of vacuum. The apertured rotating screen includes wires<br>
that define a regulated pattern of apertures, whereby the wires are provided with<br>
texture. The apertured rotating screen and the impetus of vacuum cause the molten<br>
web to conform to the shape of the apertured rotating screen and, as air passes<br>
through the apertures, cause the molten web to cool, thereby obtaining three-<br>
dimensional memory. The vacuum also causes the molten web to come into contact<br>
with the textured surface of the wires causing at least partial formation of a textured<br>
pattern on the inner surface of the film. After application of vacuum and while the<br>
apertured three-dimensional web remains in close contact with the rotating screen,<br>
fluid is applied to the film to soften it and to cause it to conform even more to the<br>
textured screen wires. The film then can be removed from the screen after<br>
application of fluid, and dried if necessary.<br>
Advantageously, a single-stage process eliminates the cost associated with a second<br>
stage, and minimizes the distance and time the web must travel before contacting<br>
fluid, thereby minimizing the amount of surfactant wash-off. Because there is no 2nd<br>
water jet application stage, surfactant wash-off is reduced even more. Also<br>
advantageously, because the single screen supports both the macro-protuberances<br>
and the micro-protuberances while the fluid softening/texturing procedure takes<br>
place, the damage caused by fluid to the 1st set of micro-protuberances in the Curro<br>
process is eliminated. Yet another advantage of the process of the invention is that<br>
by texturing around screen aberrations instead of micro-apertures, fluid does not<br>
have to penetrate through micro-peforations in the screen of Curro to form the<br>
texture thereby permitting use of an external water removal system. In addition to<br>
the benefits of external versus internal systems, the use of a blower system to blow-<br>
out water that may reside inside of the large vacuum formed apertures enhances<br>
Agent's File Reference 44904.548PCT<br>
dryness and permits the use of a smaller, less expensive, drying systems.<br>
The resulting web of the invention has the resiliency of vacuum formed films and has<br>
improved softness of water formed films, when compared to prior art vacuum<br>
formed films.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE<br>
EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Set forth below are definitions of some of the terms and expressions used herein.<br>
The term "substantially" means that a given property or parameter (such as the<br>
surface angle) may vary by about 30% from the stated value.<br>
The phrase "regulated pattern" means regions of protuberances in the film (and<br>
therefore in the component(s) of the absorbent article which include the film) where<br>
a selected property or selected properties of the capillaries are repeatably controlled,<br>
i.e., the property or properties is or are controlled to achieve a desired pattern of the<br>
selected property or properties. If a region comprises a regulated pattern of<br>
capillaries, it does not necessarily mean that all capillaries in that region have exactly<br>
the same property (or properties) which was selected to be controlled. It means that<br>
the selected property is varied in a designed, prescribed manner (or pattern) to<br>
substantially achieve a particular formula. Each region has only one regulated<br>
pattern.<br>
The term "permeability" refers to the permeability of vapor or liquid. The term<br>
"coverstock" refers to the body contacting web which is part of a personal care<br>
article. Coverstock webs can be film webs, nonwovens webs, laminate webs and<br>
apertured laminate webs. The term "web" refers to a material capable of being<br>
wound into a roll. Webs can be film webs, nonwoven webs, laminate webs,<br>
apertured laminate webs etc. The term "sheet" refers to a curtain of extruded molten<br>
polymer that has not solidified into a film.<br>
The term "film" refers to a web made by extruding a molten sheet of polymeric<br>
material by a cast or blown extrusion process and then cooling the sheet to form a<br>
solid polymeric web. Films can be monolayer films, coextruded films, coated films,<br>
and composite films. Coated films are films comprising a monolayer or coextruded<br>
film that are subsequently coated (extrusion coated, impression coated, printed) with<br>
a thin layer of the same or different material to which it is bonded, and after bonding,<br>
is incapable of separation under normal use conditions. Composite films are films<br>
comprising more than one film where the at least two films are bonded in a bonding<br>
process. Bonding processes may incorporate adhesive layers between the film layers<br>
or heat and/or pressure.<br>
The term "fluid" is used herein to denote a flowable material, and preferably a<br>
material whose flow rate can be increased by an increase in pressure. Exemplary<br>
fluids include water, air, gels, and combinations thereof. Preferred fluids include<br>
water and air.<br>
The term "panel" means a square or rectangularly shaped sheet of steel or similar<br>
material. The term "plate" means a bonded stack of panels. The term "perforation"<br>
as used herein refers to an aperture in the screen.<br>
The term "indentation" as used herein refers to a recess, or dcbossment, located at<br>
least on the outermost surface of the screen. Indentations may connect the outermost<br>
surface and the innermost surface of the screen to create perforations in the screen.<br>
In other words, perforations are indentations but indentations are not necessarily<br>
perforations.<br>
The phrase "inner surface" when referring to the formed film means the flat film<br>
surface that comes into contact with the screen surface. The phrase "inner surface"<br>
when referring to the screen means the screen surface that does not come into<br>
contact with the film and which is opposite the film-contacting surface of the screen.<br>
The film-contacting surface of the screen is called the "outer surface" of the screen.<br>
The term "aberration" as used herein refers to a three-dimensional member, or<br>
embossment, with a base portion located on the outermost surface of the screen and<br>
an apex projecting outwardly from the surface of the screen. Aberrations may form<br>
regulated patterns or may be placed randomly on the screen surface.<br>
The expression "minimum width" as used herein to describe apertures, perforations,<br>
or indentations, means the minimum distance possible between any two edges<br>
measured on the plane of the aperture (or perforation or indentation). The minimum<br>
width of a circle is its diameter. The minimum width of an ellipse is the length of its<br>
minor axis. The minimum width of a slot is the distance between its parallel long<br>
edges.<br>
The expression "maximum width" as used herein to describe apertures, perforations,<br>
or indentations, means the maximum distance possible between any two edges<br>
measured on the plane of the aperture (or perforation or indentation). The maximum<br>
width of a circle is its diameter. The maximum width of an ellipse is the length of<br>
its major axis. The maximum width of a slot is the distance between its edges<br>
measured along a direction that is parallel to its length.<br>
The term "mesh" as used herein to describe a regulated pattern means the square root<br>
of the maximum number of polygonal shapes (such as first apertures or protrusions)<br>
that can be inscribed in a flat square area measuring 1 inch (25,400 urn) on the side.<br>
Mesh can also be defined by describing the manner in which the protrusions are<br>
located in relation to each other as measured by their center-to-center distances. For<br>
example, a tightly packed square pattern of protuberances with 0.1 inch center-to-<br>
center distances is a 10 mesh square pattern. A tightly packed hexagonal pattern of<br>
protuberances with 0.1 inch center-to-center distances is a 10.7 mesh hexagonal<br>
pattern (hexagonal patterns being packed more tightly than square patterns). A<br>
tightly packed hexagonal pattern of protuberances with 0.01 inch center-to-center<br>
distances is a 107 mesh hexagonal pattern.<br>
The term "screen" as used herein refers to a three-dimensional molding apparatus<br>
comprising indentations used to form protuberances in films. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment screens comprise tubular members, having a length and a<br>
diameter, m alternative embodiments screens comprise belts having a width and a<br>
length. The transverse direction is the direction parallel to the width of the screen.<br>
The machine direction is the direction parallel to the direction of rotation of the<br>
screen, and is perpendicular to the transverse direction.<br>
The phrase "macro-protuberance" can be defined by reference to a three-dimensional<br>
member comprising an apertured base portion located in the plane of the first surface<br>
of the film and a sidewall portion extending generally in the direction of the second<br>
surface of the film. Each base portion has a sidewall portion. Sidewall portions<br>
terminate at an apex located in the plane of the second surface of the film. A<br>
macro-protuberance is a relatively large protuberance extending from the first<br>
surface to the second surface, and is comprised of the aperture in the base portion in<br>
the first surface, the sidewalls, and the end in the second surface. The ends of the<br>
protuberances may be apertured or unapertured. An apertured macro-protuberance<br>
also is referred to herein as a macro-aperture.<br>
The apertures in the base portions of the protuberances, also called "primary<br>
apertures", are preferably in the shape of polygons, e.g., squares, hexagons,<br>
pentagons, ellipses, circles, ovals, slots, etc., in a regulated or random pattern. The<br>
protubered ends if apertured are called "secondary apertures", and are preferably in<br>
the shape of polygons, e.g., squares, hexagons, pentagons, ellipses, circles, ovals,<br>
slots, etc. Macro-protuberances in the film correspond to relatively large<br>
indentations in the screen, and apertured macro-protuberances in the film correspond<br>
to perforations in the screen.<br>
The phrase "micro-protuberance" can be defined by reference to a three-dimensional<br>
member comprising an apertured base portion located in the plane of the first surface<br>
of the film and a sidewall portion extending generally in the direction of a third<br>
surface of the film. Each base portion has a sidewall portion. Sidewall portions<br>
terminate at an apex located in the plane of the third surface of the film. A micro-<br>
protuberance is a relatively small protuberance extending from the first surface to a<br>
third surface, and is comprised of an aperture in the base portion in the first surface,<br>
the sidewalls, and the end in the third surface. The ends of the micro-protuberances<br>
may be apertured or unapertured. An apertured micro-protuberance also is referred<br>
to herein as a micro-aperture. The apertures in the base portions of the micro-<br>
protuberances, also called "primary apertures", are preferably in the shape of<br>
polygons, e.g., squares, hexagons, pentagons, ellipses, circles, ovals, slots, etc., in a<br>
regulated or random pattern. Micro-protuberances in the film correspond to<br>
aberrations in. the screen.<br>
The prefix "macro" as used herein refers to structural features or elements that are<br>
readily visible to a normal human eye when the perpendicular distance between the<br>
viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 30 centimeters (cm). Conversely, the<br>
prefix "micro" is utilized to refer to structural features or elements that are not<br>
readily visible to a normal human eye when the perpendicular distance between the<br>
viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 30 cm.<br>
With regard to the protubered webs of the present invention, a given protubernace's<br>
"amplitude" refers to the distance from the plane where the protuberance originates<br>
to the surface where the protuberance terminates.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "female side" denotes the side or surface of a web where<br>
the protuberances being described originate. In contrast, the phrase "male side"<br>
denotes the side or surface of a web where the protuberances being described<br>
terminate. In the case of webs having both macro-protuberances and micro-<br>
protuberances, where the macro and micro-protuberances extend in opposite<br>
directions, the female side will be the side or surface of the web where the macro-<br>
protuberances originate, and the male side will be the side or surface of the web<br>
where the macro-protuberance terminates.<br>
Typically, use of the phrase "micro-protuberance" refers to an protuberance having<br>
as its maximum width a distance of not more than about 300 mm, preferably not<br>
more than about 200 mm, still more preferably not more than about 100 mm. The<br>
phrase "macro-protuberance" typically refers to an aperture having,a maximum<br>
width of greater than about 300 mm.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "migratable surfactant" refers to any surfactant that is<br>
chemically incompatible with the thermoplastic polymer with which it is combined,<br>
such that it will migrate to the film's surface over time to alter the fluid handling<br>
dynamics of the polymer's surface. Representative materials useful as the surfactant<br>
and the thermoplastic polymer are described below.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic of a known vacuum forming system. A polymer blend is<br>
conveyed, mixed and blended in an extruder (not shown) and delivered to the<br>
extrusion die 10, preferably a cast extrusion die 10. A molten polymer curtain 12, or<br>
sheet, exits the die and is laid over a rotating apertured screen 14. The screen<br>
conveys the polymer sheet over vacuum slot 16 where air is forced to pass through<br>
the sheet and into the vacuum tube 18 forming apertures in the film that conform to<br>
the apertures in the screen. The formed film 42 is taken off of rotating apertured<br>
screen 14 at roller 40.<br>
Such vacuum forming systems are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,929,135, 4,324,246, 4,342,314, 4,252,516, 4,535,020, 5,591,510, U.S. Application<br>
Nos. 09/876440 filed June 6, 2001, 60/346751 filed January 17, 2002, and<br>
10/082040 filed February 20, 2002, the disclosures of which are incorporated by<br>
reference herein in their entirety. The fiber-like interconnecting wires that define<br>
the apertures in the screen may be microtextured according to the teachings of Ahr,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,465,045 ("Ahr"). Microtexture is defined by Ahr as aberrations<br>
(e.g., micro-protrusions) whose amplitude is about 0.3 mils (7.5 mm). The<br>
aberrations preferably are arranged in a hexagonally close packed pattern with at<br>
most 4 mil (100 mm) center-to-center spacing between adjacent aberrations. Such a<br>
regulated pattern of aberrations also can be described as a hexagonal 267 mesh<br>
pattern. As disclosed by Ahr, the microtexture can be obtained by etching the outer<br>
surface of the screen.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic of a known two-stage high pressure water forming system.<br>
A polymer blend is conveyed, mixed and blended in an extruder and delivered to the<br>
extrusion die. The molten polymer curtain, or sheet, exits the die and is laid over a<br>
rotating two roll embossing system 100 where the web is pressed and cooled and<br>
thereby acquires two-dimensional memory. The flat film is conveyed over a 1st stage<br>
water forming station 102 and is caused to form micro-apertures by spraying high<br>
pressure water on the film, that is supported by screen 104. Subsequently, the micro-<br>
apertured film is conveyed over a 2nd stage water forming station 112 and is caused<br>
to form macro-apertures by spraying high pressure water on the film that is<br>
supported by screen 110. The formed film then is dried in drying apparatus 114.<br>
One particularly important feature of this process is that the micro-apertures<br>
terminating at a third surface formed by forcing film into micro-perforations in the<br>
screen in the Is1 stage extend in opposite direction as the macro apertures terminating<br>
at a 2nd surface, which are formed in the 2nd stage. In other words the third surface is<br>
not intermediate the first and second surfaces. Another important feature of this<br>
process is that the 2nd stage forming screen provides web support to the film but it<br>
does not conform to the micro-perforation pattern of the lsl stage. Accordingly,<br>
even though the web is supported, the 1st stage micro-apertures are not, and as a<br>
result, the 2nd stage water jet deforms the 1st stage micro-apertures. This is evident<br>
clearly by the observable variation in micro-apertured diameter shown in Figure 10<br>
of U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,462, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety, which figure is an image of a film made by this process.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic of a preferred embodiment of a single-stage vacuum and<br>
fluid forming system of the invention. In general, the soft, resilient web can be made<br>
using a single rotating screen, a vacuum section, and a fluid application section. In<br>
accordance with the preferred method, a polymer blend first is conveyed, mixed and<br>
blended in an extruder by means well known in the art and therefore not shown or<br>
described in detail herein. The molten polymer can be delivered to an extrusion die<br>
10. The molten polymer curtain 12, or sheet, exits the die and preferably although<br>
not necessarily is immediately laid over a rotating screen 14. Preferably, the screen<br>
14 is an aperture forming/texturing screen 14. As the screen rotates the molten<br>
polymer is carried over vacuum block 16 where vacuum is applied to form macro-<br>
protuberances, and to cool the molten sheet. During this cooling process, the film<br>
crystallizes, either partially or fully, and acquires three-dimensional memory. The<br>
vacuum at vacuum block 16 can be created by suctioning air at one or both ends of<br>
vacuum tube 18, for example. Other techniques for creating a vacuum at vacuum<br>
block 16 will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and can be used in the<br>
context of the invention described and claimed herein.<br>
The now resilient macro-protuberanced, preferably macro-apertured film and the<br>
screen move together to a water jet nozzle 20. A water stream 22 impinges on the<br>
film while the screen is supported by a support block 24. Applying the water<br>
through water jet nozzle 20 serves to "work" the fiber-like wires of the film to soften<br>
them, and also causes the film to adopt a mirror image of the texturing surface<br>
present in the fiber-like wires of the screen. The texture of the screen was previously<br>
impressed upon the inner surface of the film during the vacuum forming step and is<br>
now more clearly impressed such that it is more clearly visible and palpable. The<br>
additional texture enhances the perception of softness. The soft and resilient film<br>
continues to travel as the screen continues to rotate, until it passes over a blower<br>
block 26.<br>
Air preferably is blown from one or both ends of a blown air tube 28 and exits the<br>
tube through the blower block 26 and through the macro-apertures in the soft and<br>
resilient film. As air passes through the hole it removes water droplets that might<br>
have lodged inside the apertured film protrusions. Further water removal takes place<br>
as the film passes over a support block and a water removal roller 30. Process water<br>
is captured by an external drip pan 32, enabling its easy removal and further<br>
treatment prior to disposal or recycle, if desired.<br>
The soft and resilient film 42 then preferably is removed from the screen via removal<br>
roller 40 and dried in a drying apparatus 44. The dried soft and resilient film 46 then<br>
can subsequently be wound into a roll, if desired. Alternatively, the film 46 may be<br>
slit, corona treated, or laminated to other materials prior to winding or slitting (not<br>
shown). Alternatively the film or laminate may be die-cut and the cut components<br>
may be boxed or packaged in roll form.<br>
An additional preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the schematic<br>
of Figure 4. As shown in this embodiment, molten polymer is delivered to an<br>
extrusion die 10 by an extruder or other mixing apparatus. The molten polymer<br>
curtain 12, or sheet, exits the die and preferably although not necessarily is<br>
immediately laid over a rotating screen 14. Preferably, the screen 14 is an aperture<br>
forming/texturing screen 14. As the screen rotates the molten polymer is carried<br>
over vacuum block 16 where vacuum is applied to form macro-protuberances, and to<br>
cool the molten sheet. During this cooling process, the film crystallizes, either<br>
partially or fully, and acquires three-dimensional memory. The vacuum at vacuum<br>
block 16 can be created by suctioning air at one or both ends of vacuum tube 18, for<br>
example.<br>
The now resilient macro-protuberanced, preferably macro-apertured film and the<br>
screen move together to an air knife 200, or other apparatus capable of delivering<br>
pressurized air. An air stream 220 impinges on the film, preferably although not<br>
necessarily, while the screen is supported by a support block 24. Applying the air<br>
220 through air knife 200 serves to "work" the fiber-like wires of the film to soften<br>
them, and also causes the film to adopt a mirror image of the texturing surface<br>
present in the fiber-like wires of the screen. The texture of the screen was previously<br>
impressed upon the inner surface of the film during the vacuum forming step and is<br>
now more clearly impressed such that it is more clearly visible and palpable. The<br>
additional texture enhances the perception of softness. The soft and resilient film<br>
continues to travel as the screen continues to rotate, until it proceeds to removal<br>
roller 40.<br>
A variety of perforating screens have been developed over the years. A screen can<br>
be constructed with an electroforming technique such as that described in Pruyn,<br>
U.S. Patent 4,383,896, and in Morssinkhof, U.S. Patent 4,496,434, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Briefly, in the method<br>
disclosed in Pruyn, a screen skeleton is formed on a matrix in an electrolytic bath.<br>
Thereafter the screen skeleton is stripped from the matrix and subjected to an<br>
electrolysis in a second electrolytic bath in the presence of at least one brightener.<br>
The second electrolytic bath is such that the growth of metal deposit on the screen<br>
skeleton is primarily perpendicular to the surface of the screen skeleton, whereby the<br>
metal deposited on the surface of the skeleton completes the wires that define a<br>
regulated pattern of indentations. Various metals such as copper and nickel may be<br>
used. In certain embodiments where the solid web is thicker and/or stronger (due to<br>
its composition) than other webs, and therefore where water jet energy necessary to<br>
texture the web is higher, a nickel screen will be preferred clue to its additional<br>
strength, when compared to copper.<br>
Radel, U.S. Patent 4,508,256, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in<br>
its entirety, discloses a method of making a forming screen (the "PEL" method) by<br>
etching flat metal panels and stacking those panels in a manner such that the<br>
openings in the panels align to form passageways in the stack. The center axis of the<br>
passageways is disposed at a 90 degree angle from a plane parallel to the surface of<br>
the stack, m other words the passageways are aligned perpendicularly to the surface<br>
of the stack. The stacked panels then are bonded, rolled, and welded to form a<br>
cylindrical tube or screen. The passageways in the resulting screens also are aligned<br>
perpendicularly to the surface of the screens. Screens produced by this method are<br>
referred to as PEL screens. Rieker, U.S. Patent 5,562,932 and U.S. Patent<br>
5,718,928, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entireties, disclose an improved PEL method for producing screens capable of<br>
forming angled or curved capillaries. The Rieker patents disclose constructing the<br>
screen from multiple panels, each panel having openings that are positioned to form<br>
passageways through the screen. By stacking the panels in a manner such that the<br>
centers of the openings in each panel are offset from the centers of the openings in<br>
the remaining panels it is possible to create passageways whose center axis is<br>
disposed at an angle different than 90 degrees from a plane parallel to the surface of<br>
the screen. In other words the passageways are aligned at a non-perpendicular angle,<br>
or slanted.<br>
Alternatively, a high energy beam perforation process can be used to form<br>
perpendicular or angled passageways in a cylinder to form a screen, for example, by<br>
the method described in Rose, WO 00/16726. The method and screen described in<br>
the Rose patent application could be improved to produce screens and to form the<br>
films and articles of the invention.<br>
Ahr, U.S. Patent No. 4,465,045, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety, discloses a formed film exhibiting a non-glossy visible surface. The<br>
formed film is provided with a regularly spaced microscopic pattern of surface<br>
protuberances that de-gloss the film surface. The micro-protuberances are<br>
transmitted through the thickness of the web by application of vacuum to a semi-<br>
molten web while it is in contact with a rotating screen with aberrations on its<br>
surface. The aberrations project into the film causing it to protrude on the opposite<br>
side thus forming micro-protuberances. Ahr teaches that to achieve de-glossing of<br>
the film surface the micro-protuberances must be spaced in a regulated pattern, each<br>
of the micro-protuberances in the pattern are free of planar areas that are large<br>
enough to inscribe a four mil (100 mm) diameter circle and are so spaced relative to<br>
all adjacent micro-protuberances that the maximum diameter of any circle which can<br>
be inscribed on any planar surface intermediate said micro-protuberances and said<br>
adjacent micro-protuberances is less than about four mils (100 mm).<br>
A commonly used film marketed under the trademark "DRI-WEAVE"® by Procter<br>
&amp; Gamble Co. exhibits the characteristics taught by Ahr. DEI-WEAVE® film has a<br>
215 mesh hexagonal pattern of micro-protuberances on its surface (the center-to-<br>
center minimum distance between any two micro-protuberances is 5 mils (125 mm)).<br>
The amplitude of such micro-protuberances is less than about 2 mils (50 mm). A<br>
cross-section of the Ahr film as it is being formed on the screen is shown in Figure<br>
11. Aberrations 604 of cylindrical shape, about 1 mil (25 mm) in length and 1 mil<br>
(25 mm) in diameter are positioned on the surface of a perforated screen 601 on<br>
about 5 mil (125 mm) center-to-center distance. Molten polymeric film conforms to<br>
the peripheral surface of the aberration forming a micro-protuberance 614 .that<br>
extends away from the planar surface of the film 611 — in other words a micro-<br>
protuberance whose third surface is not intermediate the first and second surfaces of<br>
the film where the 1st surface is the planar surface and the 2nd surface is the end of<br>
the macro-protuberance.<br>
Figures 7-10 illustrate an exemplary etching process used to create a regulated<br>
pattern of aberrations on the surface of screen wires 601. The perforated screen<br>
wires 601 are enveloped in a removable etch-resist coating 602 to provide a<br>
texturing surface. The wires in the un-textured screen may be flattened by grinding<br>
or turning to provide a useful flat surface. A photosensitive mask 603 consisting of<br>
the desired texturing pattern is applied over the coating. The mask 603 and etch<br>
resist coating 602 can be designed by those skilled in the art to effect the requisite<br>
surface aberrations 604 depending on whether a positive or negative relief is formed.<br>
An illumination source is applied to cure the coating in areas not covered by the<br>
mask. The uncured coating is removed, and acid is subsequently applied to remove<br>
metal in the areas coincident with the areas where uncured coating was removed.<br>
Surface aberrations 604 are visible once the uncured coating is removed. The etch-<br>
resist coating 602 then can be removed leaving behind a finished apertured screen<br>
with surface aberrations 604. A laser process also can be utilized to provide surface<br>
aberrations. In this process a high energy beam is traced over the un-textured<br>
surface of a screen, thereby removing strips of metal of the desired depth and width.<br>
Subsequent strips can be removed until the desired surface aberrations are formed.<br>
In an alternative method, a laser beam can be used to trace and. burn-off etch-resist<br>
coating. This method eliminates the need to create and apply the mask shown in<br>
Figure 8. Those skilled in the art are capable of using any suitable method to form<br>
the screen having the dimensions described herein, using the guidelines provided<br>
herein.<br>
The etching process controls the types of micro-protuberances that can be made.<br>
One limitation of the etching process is the depth of etching possible in relation to<br>
the etching area. The "etching aspect ratio" means the ratio of depth of etching to<br>
the minimum etching surface between unetched surfaces. For instance, a screen<br>
used to make DRI-WEAVE® film has a 215 mesh hexagonal aberrations pattern and<br>
the aberrations measure about 1 mil in height by 1 mil in diameter. The depth of<br>
etching is 1 mil and the minimum distance between un-etched surfaces is 4 mils.<br>
The etching aspect ratio therefore is 1:4. If an aspect ratio of about 1.2:1 were used,<br>
the maximum expected etched aberration height possible for 215 mesh hexagonal<br>
patterns would be 4.8 mils. Wider separation between aberrations would therefore<br>
enable the construction of greater height aberrations, and narrower separation would<br>
limit the height of the aberrations. Increasing the diameter of the aberrations will<br>
reduce their height. The disclosures of the Ahr, Morssinkhof, Pruyn, Rieker, Radel,<br>
and Rose patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Using the<br>
guidelines provided herein, those skilled in the art are capable of designing a screen<br>
for use in forming films in accordance with this invention.<br>
The soft, resilient webs of various embodiments of the present invention preferably<br>
have three-dimensional memory and the perception of softness that is desired by<br>
consumers who use the webs in body-contacting garments or articles. The webs of<br>
the embodiments of the invention have improved softness, when compared to<br>
vacuum formed films and improved resiliency, when compared to the conventional<br>
two-stage high pressure water jet made films. While not intending on being bound<br>
by any theory of operation, one reason for the improved softness is believed to be<br>
attributable to the embodiment where water is used in the second processing to help<br>
work the film (see, Figure 3).<br>
A preferred soft, resilient web of the present invention is shown in Figure 5. As<br>
shown therein, the webs 400 of embodiments of the present invention include a<br>
plurality of macro-protuberances in the form of macro-apertures 410, preferably in<br>
the shape of a pentagon, although they may have any shape and size, and a plurality<br>
of micro-protuberances 420, preferably circular in cross-section. Again,<br>
protuberances can have any cross-section. Figure 5 only shows some of the micro-<br>
protuberances 420 that may be present in web for purposes of clarity. Other<br>
commonly used shapes include hexagonal, square, and oval. Web 400 can be made<br>
from any material that is capable of being deformed by vacuum and fluid.<br>
Preferably, such deformable materials include those that, when stretched beyond<br>
their elastic limit, will substantially retain its newly formed conformation. Preferred<br>
materials for use in the invention include chemically homogeneous or heterogeneous<br>
materials such as homopolymers and polymer blends, structurally homogeneous and<br>
heterogeneous materials such as sheets and laminates, or any combinations thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred materials include polymeric films of ethylene, propylene,<br>
butylene, styrene, and butadiene, including homopolymers, copolymers, and blends<br>
thereof. Polyethylene films include high density, low density, linear low density,<br>
metallocene and conventional polyethylene polymers. As mentioned previously,<br>
web 400 may be comprised of one polymeric film, or may be a plurality of films,<br>
including co-extruded films and laminates.<br>
The three-dimensional webs preferably have a loft, or height "h" of from about 0.100<br>
to about 2.50 mm, preferably from about 0.100 to about 2.00 mm, and more<br>
preferably from about 0.100 to about 1.50 mm. The dimensions of the macro-<br>
apertures 410 of the invention can vary widely, depending on the desired look and<br>
feel of the web, as well as the geometric design of the apertures (i.e., hexagonal,<br>
pentagonal, heptagonal, circular, etc.). If pentagonal macro-apertures 410 are used<br>
as shown in Figure 5, the following dimensions are preferred. The thickness "t" of<br>
the ribs or wires of this particularly preferred embodiment of the invention can range<br>
anywhere from about 0.04 to about 0.80 mm, preferably from about 0.06 to about<br>
0.70 mm, and most preferably from about 0.08 to about 0.6 mm. The diameter "d"<br>
of the macro-apertures 410, e.g., the distance from one side to the other, can be<br>
anywhere from about 0.1 to about 2.5 mm, preferably from about 0.1 to about 2.0<br>
mm, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 1.7 mm, more preferably from about<br>
0.1 mm to about 1.55 mm, and most preferably from about 1.55 mm to about 2.0<br>
mm. The macro-apertures of webs of the invention will vary significantly in their<br>
structure depending on their intended use. For example DRI-IVEAVE® film has a<br>
25 mesh pentagonal pattern of macro-apertures where each aperture has a maximum<br>
width of about 0.8mm. Such a film is desirable for use as a top sheet or coverstock<br>
in various absorbent articles. The dimensions of the micro-protuberances 420 also<br>
will vary, as described in more detail below with reference to Figure 13.<br>
Other films having different patterns may be produced by the method of various<br>
embodiments of the invention. For example, a hexagonal 64 mesh pattern of macro-<br>
protuberances, preferably macro-apertures, may be desirable for use as a breathable<br>
backsheet or a breathable elastic side-panel. A 64 mesh hexagonal pattern may have<br>
apertures spaced on 16.6 mil centers. Therefore, the diameters of the apertures could<br>
be controlled to provide as much or as little permeability as desired. Less<br>
permeability would require smaller apertures that correspondingly leaves more film<br>
surface to be textured. The regulated pattern of macro-protuberances also could be<br>
modified to have multiple zones of apertures, thereby providing a controlled way to<br>
impart various types of elastic properties in films. Those skilled in the art will be<br>
capable of varying any and all of the aforementioned aperture and protuberance<br>
dimensions (macro 410 and micro 420) using the guidelines provided, herein, as well<br>
as the design of the web 400 (e.g., continuous array of macro-apertures 410 and<br>
micro-protuberances 420, a scattered configuration of apertures, or apertures<br>
arranged to depict a graphical image, textual message or other identifying indicia).<br>
When used in an absorbent article, the web 400 of the present invention preferably<br>
has a body-contacting surface 430, (e.g., the first surface), and a garment or<br>
absorbent core facing surface 440 (e.g., the second surface). As shown in Figure 5,<br>
the ends of the micro-protuberances 420 terminate at a 3rd surface.<br>
Referring back to Figure 3, the preferred process of the present invention will be<br>
described in greater detail. The polymers that are to be used to form the film<br>
preferably are fed, together with any processing additives and aids known to those<br>
skilled in the art, to a melting and mixing apparatus, preferably an extruder. The<br>
molten polymer curtain 12 exiting the extrusion die 10, or a co-extruded polymer<br>
curtain 12 exiting multiple extrusion dies 10, contacts rotating aperture<br>
forming/texturing screen 14. The molten polymer curtain 12 can be fed directly to<br>
the rotating aperture forming/texturing screen 14, or it may be cooled (fully or<br>
partially) prior to such contact. Polymer curtain 12 need not be fully molten<br>
polymer, but rather can be a polymer curtain 12 that is at a temperature above the<br>
softening point of the polymer(s) used to form the curtain 12. Rotating aperture<br>
forming/texturing screen 14 can be made by any technique known in the art, and<br>
preferably is an apertured nickel electroplated screen having the desired aperture<br>
size, aberrations pattern and configuration. For example, the rotating aperture<br>
forming/texturing screen 14 can be formed into the shape shown in Figure 5.<br>
As the screen rotates, the polymer, which remains at a temperature preferably above<br>
the softening point of the polymer(s) used to make the film, is carried over vacuum<br>
block 16 where vacuum is applied to aperture, pre-texture, and cool the molten<br>
sheet. During this cooling process, the film crystallizes, either partially or fully, and<br>
acquires three-dimensional memory. The vacuum at vacuum block 16 can be<br>
created by suctioning air at one or both ends of vacuum tube 18, for example. Other<br>
techniques for creating a vacuum at vacuum block 16 will be readily apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art, and can be used in the context of the invention described and<br>
claimed herein. The amount of vacuum created by vacuum block 16 will vary<br>
depending on the degree of deformation required, which typically is dependent upon<br>
the particular apertured configuration as well as the temperature of the polymer<br>
curtain 12. It is preferred in the present invention to direct molten polymer directly<br>
from a cast extrusion die 10 to the rotating screen 14, and that the vacuum level be<br>
from about 0 to about 500 mm Hg, more preferably from about 10 to about 250 mm<br>
Hg, and most preferably from about 20 to about 200 mm Hg. Those skilled in the art<br>
are capable of determining a suitable amount of vacuum to generate in vacuum block<br>
16, using the guidelines provided herein.<br>
After forming the film at the vacuum block 16, the film becomes resilient.<br>
"Resilient" as it is used herein denotes a material that substantially retains its<br>
conformation upon application of pressure and heat, with the exception of heating up<br>
to its softening temperature. Substantially retaining its conformation denotes a<br>
material that can "spring back" to up to 90%, preferably 95%, and more preferably<br>
100% of its original conformation, after the temperature and/or pressure load have<br>
been removed. The now resilient macro-apertured film and the screen move<br>
together to a water jet nozzle 20. A water stream 22 impinges on the film while the<br>
screen is supported by a support block 24. It is preferred that the water stream be<br>
applied as a stream of water at room temperature or higher, preferably from about<br>
40°C to about 90°C, more preferably from about 65°C to about 75°C. Preferred<br>
water pressures range anywhere from about 10 N/cm2 to about 500 N/cm2, more<br>
preferably from about 25 N/cm2 to about 350 N/cm2, and mosv preferably less than<br>
about 300 N/cm2.<br>
It is preferred in the present invention that water does not pass through the already<br>
formed macro-apertures 410 (Fig. 5). Applying the water through water jet nozzle<br>
20 (Fig. 3) serves to "work" the fiber-like wires of the film to soften them, and also<br>
causes the film to adopt a mirror image of the texturing surface present in the fiber-<br>
like wires of the screen. The texture of the screen was previously impressed upon<br>
the inner surface of the film during the vacuum forming procedure and is now more<br>
clearly impressed such that it is more clearly visible and palpable. The additional<br>
texture enhances the perception of softness.<br>
While it is preferred to use support block 24 and not to use vacuum during the water<br>
spraying procedure, support block 24 need not be used. In addition, a vacuum may<br>
be applied to assist in sucking the water through the macro-apertures 410, and to dry<br>
the apertures. In this alternative embodiment, a water removal system would be<br>
employed inside the rotating screen 14, such as those described in any of the Curro<br>
patents.<br>
The soft and resilient film of the present invention then continues to travel as the<br>
screen 14 continues to rotate, until it preferably passes over a blower block 26.<br>
Again, although blower block 26 is preferred in the invention,, a vacuum could be<br>
employed in the same or similar manner as described above. In the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, air is blown from one or both ends of a blown air tube<br>
28 and exits the tube through the blower block 26 and through the macro-apertures<br>
410 in the soft and resilient film 400. As air passes through the holes in the film, it<br>
preferably removes water droplets that might have lodged inside the apertured film<br>
protrusions. In this context, it is preferred to use heated dry air, and preferably air at<br>
a temperature within the range of from about 40°C to about 90°C, more preferably<br>
from about 65°C to about 75°C. Further water removal may optionally take place as<br>
the film passes over a support block and a water removal roller 30. Process water<br>
preferably is captured by an external drip pan 32, enabling its easy removal and<br>
further treatment prior to disposal or recycle, if desired.<br>
The soft and resilient film 42 then preferably is removed from the screen via removal<br>
roller 40 and dried in a drying apparatus 44. The dried soft and resilient film 46 then<br>
can subsequently be wound into a roll, if desired. Alternatively, the film 46 may be<br>
slit, corona treated, or laminated to other materials prior to winding or slitting (not<br>
shown). Alternatively the film or laminate may be die-cut and the cut components<br>
may be boxed or packaged in roll form.<br>
A cross-section of a non-performing film made by a known method is shown in<br>
Figure 12. Non-performance is primarily due to the harsh feeling texture of the film<br>
shown. Aberrations 604 of cylindrical shape, over about 2 mil (55 mm) in length and<br>
1 mil (25 mm) in diameter are disposed on the surface of a perforated screen 601 in a<br>
215 mesh hexagonal pattern. Molten polymeric film conforms to the peripheral<br>
surface of the aberration forming a protuberance 614 that extends away from the<br>
planar surface of the film 611. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors<br>
believe that the harsh texture results because the molten polymer envelops, the<br>
aberration and crystallizes without it being worked sufficiently and without it<br>
stretching sufficiently to properly form around the entire aberration and thereby<br>
causing its side-portions to thin and soften.<br>
A cross-section of a particularly preferred film of an embodiment of the<br>
invention made by the methods described herein is shown in Figure 13.<br>
Aberrations 604 of cylindrical shape, up to about 4 mil (100 am) in height and 1<br>
mil (25 mm) in diameter are disposed on the surface of a perforated screen 601 in<br>
a 215 mesh hexagonal pattern. Molten polymeric film partially conforms to the<br>
peripheral surface in the presence of the first vacuum process (Fig. 3), and<br>
subsequently is caused to substantially conform, in the presence of the second<br>
fluid process, to the aberration forming a protuberance 614 thai; extends away<br>
from the planar surface of the film 611. The aberrations 604 of the invention<br>
preferably are from about 2 mils to about 5 mils in height, and from about 1 to about<br>
3 mil in diameter, more preferably from about 1 to about 2 mil in diameter, when a<br>
215 Mesh hexagonal pattern is used. More preferably, the height of aberrations 604<br>
is from about 2.5 to about 4.8 mils, and most preferably, from about 3.0 to about 4.5<br>
mils, and the diameter most preferably is about 1 mil. Those having ordinary skill in<br>
the ait recognize how to vary the spacing between the aberrations 604, and<br>
consequently, form aberrations 604 that have greater height and/or diameter than<br>
those described above.<br>
Webs of the invention can be made of any film forming polymers and the proper<br>
selection of polymers will depend on the desired application of the film. Films with<br>
macro-apertured patterns comprising mesh counts greater than 54 require easily<br>
flowable polymers such as low density polyethylene with high melt indeces. Low<br>
viscosity is desirable, which will also determine the choice of polymer. Elongatable<br>
polymers are desired such that films can be formed by liquid pressure around the<br>
aberrations without breaking, for example linear low density polyethylene or<br>
metallocene catalyzed linear low density polyethylene. Clearly the size and shape of<br>
the aberrations will dictate the minimum amount of elongatable polymer necessary.<br>
A person skilled in the art will recognize that various polymers can be combined to<br>
obtain the optimal formulation for each type of film produced.<br>
After forming film 400, the film preferably can be used as one of the elements of a<br>
body-contacting article, preferably an absorbent article. A particularly preferred<br>
absorbent article is a diaper, and a typical diaper is shown in Figure (5, with the effect<br>
of elastics removed for purposes of clarity. As used herein, the terms "absorbent<br>
garment," "absorbent article" or simply "article" or "garment" refer to devices that<br>
absorb and contain body fluids and other body exudates. More specifically, these<br>
terms refer to garments that are placed against or in proximity to the body of a<br>
wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body. A non-<br>
exhaustive list of examples of absorbent garments includes diapers, diaper covers,<br>
disposable diapers, training pants, feminine hygiene products, adult incontinence<br>
products, surgical gowns, wound dressing, and the like. Such garments may be<br>
intended to be discarded or partially discarded after a single use ("disposable"<br>
garments). Such garments may comprise essentially a single inseparable structure<br>
("unitary" garments), or they may comprise replaceable inserts or other<br>
interchangeable parts.<br>
The present invention may be used with all of the foregoing classes of absorbent<br>
garments, without limitation, whether disposable or otherwise. The embodiments<br>
described herein provide, as an exemplary structure, a diaper for an infant, however<br>
this is not intended to limit the claimed invention. The invention will be understood<br>
to encompass, without limitation, the use of the web 400 in all classes and types of<br>
absorbent garments, including those described herein.<br>
Throughout this description, the term "disposed" and the expressions "disposed on,"<br>
"disposing on," "disposed in," "disposed between" and variations thereof (e.g., a<br>
description of the article being "disposed" is interposed between the words<br>
"disposed" and "on") are intended to mean that one element can be integral with<br>
another element, or that one element can be a separate structure bonded to or placed<br>
with or placed near another element. Thus, a component that is "disposed on" an<br>
element of the absorbent garment can be formed or applied directly or indirectly to a<br>
surface of the element, formed or applied between layers of a multiple layer element,<br>
formed or applied to a substrate that is placed with or near the element, formed or<br>
applied within a layer of the element or another substrate, or other variations or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Throughout this description, the terms "top sheet" and "back sheet" denote the<br>
relationship of these materials or layers with respect to the absorbent core. It is<br>
understood that additional layers may be present between the absorbent core and the<br>
top sheet and back sheet, and that additional layers and other materials may be<br>
present on the side opposite the absorbent core from either the top sheet or the back<br>
sheet.<br>
Figure 6 is a partially cut away depiction of an exemplary embodiment of an<br>
absorbent garment 500 (preferably a disposable absorbent garment) of the present<br>
invention. The embodiment shown in Figure 6 is an infant's diaper, however, this<br>
depiction is not intended to limit the invention, and those skilled in the art appreciate<br>
that the invention covers other types of absorbent articles. For simplicity, however,<br>
the invention will be described with reference to an infant's diaper. The garment<br>
500 of Figure 6 is depicted in a generally flattened position, with the body-facing<br>
side facing down, and with the various elastic components depicted in their relaxed<br>
condition with the effects of the elastics removed for clarity (when relaxed, the<br>
elastics typically cause the surrounding material to gather or "shirr"), In the<br>
flattened position, the garment 500 may have a generally hourglass shaped structure,<br>
but it may also have any other shape suitable for the given application, such as a<br>
rectangular shape, a trapezoidal shape, a "T" shape, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the longitudinal axis 100 of the garment is the dimension of the<br>
garment corresponding to the front-to-rear dimension of the user, and the lateral axis<br>
102 of the garment is the dimension corresponding to the side-to-side dimension of<br>
the user.<br>
In use, the invention comprises a pant-like garment 500 having a waist-encircling<br>
region and a crotch region. The waist-encircling region may comprise a first waist<br>
region 512, disposed adjacent to, for example, the back waist region of a wearer's<br>
body, and a second waist region 514, disposed adjacent to, for example, the front<br>
waist region of a wearer's body. The first and second waist regions 512, 514, may<br>
correspond to the front and back of the wearer's body, respectively, depending on<br>
whether garment 500 is attached in front of or behind the subject wearer. The first<br>
and second waist regions preferably are joined together at or near their lateral edges<br>
518, causing the longitudinally distal edges 520 of the garment 500 to form the<br>
perimeter of a waist opening. A crotch region 516 extends between the first and<br>
second waist regions 512, 514, and the crotch edges 522 form the perimeter of a pair<br>
of leg openings, when the garment 500 is placed on a subject wearer.<br>
The garment 500 preferably comprises a top sheet 524, and a back sheet 526, which<br>
may be substantially coterminous with the top sheet 524. When the garment 500 is<br>
being worn, the top sheet 524 faces the wearer's body, and the back sheet 526 faces<br>
away from the wearer. An absorbent core 528 preferably is disposed between at<br>
least a portion of the top sheet 524 the back sheet 526.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention may further comprise various additional<br>
features. One or more pairs of elastic gathers 530 may extend adjacent the crotch<br>
edges 522. The garment 500 may also comprise one or more waste containment<br>
systems, such as inboard standing leg gathers 540, which preferably extend from the<br>
second waist region 514 to the first waist region 512 along opposite sides of<br>
longitudinal center line 100 (only one standing leg gather system 540 is shown in<br>
Figure 5 for purposes of clarity). One or both of the first and second waist regions<br>
512, 514 may also be equipped with strips of elastic or foam 532 or other elastically<br>
extensible material, which help contract the garment around the wearer's waist,<br>
providing improved fit and leakage prevention.<br>
The absorbent garment 500 also preferably includes fastening elements to enable<br>
attachment of the first waist region 512 to second waist region 514. Fastening<br>
elements preferably include a pair of tabs 534 that extend laterally away from<br>
opposite lateral edges 518 of the first waist region 512 of the garment 500. The tabs<br>
534 may comprise an elastically extensible material (not shown), and may be<br>
designed to stretch around a wearer's waist to provide improved fit, comfort, and<br>
leakage protection. Such elasticized tabs 534 may be used in conjunction with, or in<br>
lieu of, waist foam 532, or other elastically extensible materials 532.<br>
At least one fastening mechanism 536 (collectively referred to as "fastener 536") is<br>
attached to each tab 534 for attaching the tab to the second waist region 514, thereby<br>
providing the garment 500 with a pant-like shape, and enabling garment 500 to be<br>
fixed or otherwise fitted on the wearer. The fasteners 536 may attach to one or more<br>
target devices 538 located in the second waist region 514.<br>
The various parts of the garment 50 can be attached to one anovher, associated with<br>
one another, or disposed adjacent or in between one another to form a structure that<br>
preferably maintains its shape during the useful life of the garment 500. As used<br>
herein, the terms "attached," "joined," "associated," and similar terms encompass<br>
configurations whereby a first part is directly joined to a second part by affixing the<br>
first part directly to the second part, by indirectly joining the first part to the second<br>
part through intermediate members, and by fixing the relative positions of various<br>
parts by capturing parts between other parts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that various methods or combinations of methods may be used to securely join the<br>
respective parts of the garment 500 to one another.<br>
The top sheet 524 and back sheet 526 may be constructed from a wide variety of<br>
materials known in the art. The invention is not intended to be limited to any<br>
specific materials for these components. The top sheet 524 and back sheet 526 can<br>
be shaped and sized according to the requirements of each of the various types of<br>
absorbent garment, or to accommodate various user sizes. In an embodiment of the<br>
invention in which the garment 500 is a diaper or an adult incontinence brief, the<br>
combination of top sheet 524 and back sheet 526, may have an hourglass shape, as<br>
seen in Figure 1, or may have a rectangular, trapezoidal, "T" shape, or other shape.<br>
Due to the wide variety of backing and liner sheet construction and materials<br>
currently available, the invention is not intended to be limited to any specific<br>
materials or constructions of these components. The back sheet 526 preferably is<br>
made from any suitable pliable liquid-impervious material known in the art. Typical<br>
back sheet materials include films of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, nylon,<br>
and polyvinyl chloride and blends of these materials. For example, the back sheet<br>
can be made of a polyethylene film having a thickness in the range of 0.02-0.04 mm.<br>
The back sheet 526 may be pigmented with, for example, titanium dioxide, to<br>
provide the garment 500 with a pleasing color or to render the back sheet 526<br>
opaque enough that exudates being contained by the garment 500 are not visible<br>
from outside the garment. In addition, the back sheet 526 may be formed in such a<br>
manner that it is opaque, for example, by using various inert components in the<br>
polymeric film and then biaxially stretching the film. Other back sheet materials<br>
will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The back sheet 526 preferably has<br>
sufficient liquid imperviousness to prevent any leakage of fluids. The required level<br>
of liquid imperviousness may vary between different locations on the garment 500.<br>
The back sheet 526 may be covered with a fibrous, non woven fabric such as is<br>
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,646,362 issued to Heran et al. Materials for<br>
such a fibrous outer liner include a spun-bonded non woven web of synthetic fibers<br>
such as polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester fibers; a non woven web of<br>
cellulosic fibers, textile fibers such as rayon fibers, cotton and the like, or a blend of<br>
cellulosic and textile fibers; a spun-bonded non woven web of synthetic fibers such<br>
as polypropylene; polyethylene or polyester fibers mixed with cellulosic, pulp fibers,<br>
or textile fibers; or melt blown thermoplastic fibers, such as macro fibers or micro<br>
fibers of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester or other thermoplastic materials or<br>
mixtures of such thermoplastic macro fibers or micro fibers with cellulosic, pulp or<br>
textile fibers.<br>
It is preferred in the present invention that the top sheet 524 be comprised of one or<br>
more apertured webs 400. When the apertured webs 400 are employed as the top<br>
sheet, the body-facing surface 430 (Fig. 5) of the web 400 preferably faces into the<br>
page in Figure 6 since the top sheet 524 is the lowest layer shown therein, and the<br>
garment or absorbent core facing surface 440 of web 400 preferably faces out of the<br>
page towards the absorbent core 528. Such an apertured film 400 typically is treated<br>
with a surfactant to render it hydrophilic, and as described previously, the preferred<br>
method of making the web 400 provides for less removal of the surfactant from the<br>
surface of the top sheet 524. Use of the apertured film 400 of the present invention<br>
provides a number of advantages, including the resiliency of vacuum-formed films<br>
with the improved softness of water jet formed films.<br>
[00101] The top sheet 524 and the back sheet 526 may be associated with one another using a<br>
variety of methods known in the art. For example, the}- may be thermally,<br>
ultrasonically, or chemically bonded to one another. They also may be joined using<br>
lines of hot melt adhesive or mechanical fasteners, such as thread, clips, or staples.<br>
The particular joining method may be dictated by the types of materials selected for<br>
the top sheet 524 and back sheet 526.<br>
[00102] The invention has been described with reference to particularly preferred<br>
embodiments and examples. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that<br>
various modifications may be made to the invention without significantly departing<br>
from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
