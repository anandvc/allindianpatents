				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the selective control of one or more weeds.<br>
Selective herbicides based on a substituted phenylsulphonvlaminocarbonyI-triazolinone<br>
The invention relates to the use of the known compound 2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-5-propoxy-2J4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one of the formula (I) shown below - alias methyl 2-[[[(4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-oxo-S-propoxy-lH-l^^-triazol-l-yl)-carbonyll-aminol-sulphonyll-benzoate (CAS-Reg.-No.: 145026-81-9) - and its salts, in particular its sodium salt (CAS-Reg.-No. 181274-15-7), for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants, in particular for controlling problematic weeds in cereals.<br>
Substituted phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyltriazoh'nones such as, for example, the<br>
compounds	2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-<br>
5-butoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one,	2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenyl-<br>
sulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-5-ethoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-tria2ol-3-one, 2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-5-isopropoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one,       2-(2-ethoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylamino-carbonyl)-4-methyl-5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one,      2-(2-memoxy-carbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-propoxy-5-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one     and     2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-ethyl-5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one. and their salts, processes for preparing these compounds and their use as herbicides are the subject of earlier patent applications (cf. EP-341 489, EP-422469, EP-507 171, US-5 534486). The individual abovementioned substituted phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones have a molecular structure which is very similar to that of the compound (I) to be used according to the invention but, in contrast to this compound, they show shortcomings in their activity or activity gaps in the case of certain weeds.<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compound 2-(2-methoxycarbonylphenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-<br>
4-methyl-5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-<br>
one (I) and salts thereof, in particular the sodium salt of the compound of the formula<br>
(I), in comparison with the abovementioned structurally similar compounds, show<br>
considerably stronger activity against some weeds in cereal crops which are difficult<br>
to control, combined with very good compatibility with cereal species, such as, in<br>
particular, wheat, and are therefore particularly suitable for the efficient and selective<br>
control of weeds in cereals, in particular in wheat. The activity gaps observed with<br>
the abovementioned comparative compounds which are closely related to (I) do not<br>
occur in the weed spectrum of the compound (I) and its salts.<br>
The invention provides selective-herbicidal compositions, characterized in that they<br>
contain an effective amount of the compound 2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-<br>
4-methyl-5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H- 1 ,2,4-triazol-3-one of<br>
the formula (I)<br>
and/or of salts of the compound of the formula (I), in particular of their sodium salt<br>
[referred to as "(I)-Na-salt" in the use examples].<br>
The invention furthermore provides the use of the compound 2-(2-methoxycarbonylphenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-<br>
4-methyl-5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-<br>
3-one of the formula (I) and/or of salts of the compound of the formula (I), in<br>
particular of its sodium salt, for the selective control of weeds in crops of cereals, in<br>
particular in crops of wheat.<br>
The invention furthermore provides a method for the selective control of weeds in<br>
crops of cereals, in particular in crops of wheat, which is characterized in that the<br>
compound 2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-<br>
5-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one of the formula (I) and/or salts of the<br>
compound of the formula (I), in particular its sodium salt, is/are applied with<br>
surfactants and/or customary extenders in crops of cereals.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its Na salt are already known (cf. US-5 534 486<br>
- Examples 72 and 320).<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its salts have a broad herbicidal activity. They<br>
can be used, for example, for controlling the following weeds:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the orders: Sinapis, Lepidium, Galium, Stellaria,<br>
Matricaria, Anthemis, Galinsoga, Chenopodium, Urtica, Senecio, Amaranthus,<br>
Portulaca, Xanthium, Convolvulus, Ipomoea, Polygonum, Sesbania, Ambrosia,<br>
Cirsium, Carduus, Sonchus, Solanum, Rorippa, Rotala, Linderaia, Lamium,<br>
Veronica, Abutilon, Emex, Datura, Viola, Galeopsis, Papaver, Centaurea, Trifolium,<br>
Ranunculus, Taraxacum.<br>
Monocotvledonous weeds of the orders: Echinochloa, Setaria, Panicum, Digitaria,<br>
Phleum, Poa, Festuca, Eleusine, Brachiaria, Lolium, Brornus, Avena, Cyperus,<br>
Sorghum, Agropyron, Cynodon, Monochoria, Fimbristylis, Sagittaria, Eleocharis,<br>
Scirpus, Paspalum, Ischaemum, Sphenoclea, Dactyloctenium, Agrostis, Alopecurus,<br>
Apera, Aegilops, Phalaris.<br>
However, the use of the compound (I) and its salts is by no means limited to these<br>
orders but extends in the same manner to other plants as well.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its salts have strong herbicidal activity and a<br>
broad spectrum of activity when used on the soil and on above-ground parts of<br>
plants. They are suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and<br>
dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous crops, especially in cereals, in particular<br>
in wheat, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
Problematic weeds which can be controlled particularly well with the compound of<br>
the formula (I) and its salts, in particular its sodium salt, and whose control is less<br>
likely to succeed with both conventional herbicides and more recent compounds of a<br>
similar molecular structure are, in particular, Agropyron, Alopecurus, Amaranthus,<br>
Apera, Avena, Bromus, Capsella, Erysimum, Lolium, Phalaris, Poa, Setaria, Sinapis<br>
and Thlaspi.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its salts, in particular its sodium salt, can be<br>
converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable<br>
powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules,<br>
suspension/emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with<br>
active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with<br>
the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents<br>
and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents<br>
as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially the following: aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics, such<br>
as chlorobenzenes, chlorinated aliphatics, such as chloroethylenes or methylene<br>
chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, petroleum fractions,<br>
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and<br>
esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or<br>
cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylfbrmamide and dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals,<br>
such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous<br>
earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and<br>
silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated<br>
natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic<br>
granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as<br>
sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifying and/or<br>
foam-forming agents are: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example<br>
alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates as well as<br>
protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersing agents are: for example lignin-sulphite waste<br>
liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and<br>
synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are<br>
mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colourants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and<br>
metal phthalocyanine dyes, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron,<br>
copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
For the control of weeds, the compound of the formula (I) and its salts, as such or in the<br>
form of their formulations, can also be used as mixtures with known herbicides,<br>
finished formulations or tank mixes being possible.<br>
Possible components for the mixtures are known herbicides, for example<br>
amidosulfuron, bentazon, bromoxynil, carfentrazone(-ethyl), cinidon(-ethyl), clodinafop(-<br>
propargyl), clopyralid, chlorsulfuron, chlortoluron, cyclosulfamuron, 2,4-D,<br>
diclofop(-methyl), difenzoquat, diflufenican, floransulam, flupyrsulfuron(-methyl,<br>
-sodium), pyraflufen(-ethyl), ethoxyfen, fenoxaprop(-ethyl), fluoroglycofen(-ethyl),<br>
flupropacil, fluroxypyr, iodosulfuron, isoproturon, mecoprop, metosulam,<br>
metribuzin, metsulfuron(-methyl), pendimethalin, prosulfocarb, pyridate,<br>
sulfosulfuron, thifensulfuron(-methyl), tralkoxydim, triasulfuron, tribenuron-<br>
(-methyl), trifluralin.<br>
Mixtures with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides,<br>
acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, plant nutrients and agents which improve soil<br>
structure, are also possible.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its salts can be used as such, in the form of their<br>
formulations or in the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as readyto-<br>
use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are used<br>
in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing or scattering.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) and its salts can be applied either before or after<br>
emergence of the plants. They can also be incorporated into the soil before sowing.<br>
The amount of active compound used can vary within a substantial range. It depends<br>
essentially on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the amounts used are between<br>
1 g and 1 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface, preferably between 5 g and<br>
0.5 kg per ha.<br>
The use of the compound of the formula (I) and its salts can be seen from the following<br>
examples.<br>

Example A<br>
Post-emergence test/greenhouse<br>
Solvent: 5 parts by weight of acetoneEmulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of<br>
emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired<br>
concentration.<br>
Test plants which have a height of 5 - 15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of<br>
active compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are<br>
applied per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen so that the<br>
particular amounts of active compound desired are applied in 5001 of water/ha.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is assessed in % damage in<br>
comparison to the development of the untreated control.<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0% = no effect (like untreated control)<br>
100 % = total destruction<br>
In this test, for example, the sodium salt of the compound of the formula (I) exhibits,<br>
at an application rate of 60 g/ha, very strong activity (efficacy 80% to 100%) against<br>
weeds, such as, for example, Agropyron, Alopecurus, Avena, Bromus and Lolium,<br>
combined with very good compatibility with crop plants, such as, for example,<br>
wheat, whereas the comparative compounds (A), (C), (D), (E) and (F) have<br>
considerably weaker herbicidal activity and the comparative compounds (B) and (F)<br>
are not entirely compatible with wheat, ["ai." = "active ingredient"].<br>
Example B<br>
Pre-emergence test/greenhouse<br>
Solvent: 5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of<br>
emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired<br>
concentration.<br>
Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil. After about 24 hours, the soil is<br>
sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amount of<br>
active compound desired is applied per unit area. The concentration of the spray<br>
liquor is chosen so that the particular amount of active compound desired is applied<br>
in 500 litres of water per hectare.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is tested in % damage in<br>
comparison to the development of the untreated control.<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0% = no effect (like untreated control)<br>
100% = total destruction<br>
In this test, for example, the sodium salt of the compound of the formula (I) exhibits,<br>
at application rates of from 15 g/ha to 60 g/ha, very strong activity (efficacy 80% to<br>
100%) against weeds, such as, for example, Agropyron, Alopecurus, Avena, Bromus,<br>
Lolium, Poa, Setaria and Sinapis, combined with very good compatibility with crop<br>
plants, such as, for example, wheat, whereas the comparative compounds (A), (C),<br>
(D), (E) and (F) exhibit considerably weaker herbicidal activity and the comparative<br>
Example C<br>
Post emergence tests/outdoors<br>
Under outdoor conditions, the sodium salt of the compound of the formula (I) was<br>
tested in winter wheat in Germany and France against economically important weeds.<br>
The small-plot experiments were carried out on cultivated land under agricultural<br>
use, with cultivation and climate conditions which can be considered to be<br>
representative for the period of the trial. Areas with particularly extensive weed<br>
growth were chosen by way of preference.<br>
The active compound was applied by the post-emergence method (spring) across the<br>
area by the spray method, with an average droplet size. To produce a useful<br>
preparation of active compound, the active compound was formulated as 70 WP or<br>
70 WG (70% w/w water-dispersible powder or granules) and applied with customary<br>
amounts of water.<br>
To assess the crop compatibility, from 1 to 8 weeks after the treatment, plant growth<br>
inhibitions or ailing of the leaf area were assessed in % damage in comparison to the<br>
development of the untreated control. At different intervals after the treatment, the<br>
herbicidal activity was assessed as % reduction in comparison to the untreated<br>
control, based on the weed development. The figures denote:<br>
0% = no damage of the crops or no herbicidal effect,<br>
100% = total destruction of the crops or the weeds.<br>
The experiments which were carried out show that the sodium salt of the compound<br>
of the formula (I) is particularly suitable for controlling the perennial species<br>
Agropyron repens, which is difficult to control, and the annual species Alopecurus<br>
myosuroides, Apera spica-venti, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Sinapis arvensis in<br>
cereals.<br>

weeds. The design, the practice and the evaluation of the experiments corresponded<br>
to Example C. The active compound was applied in autumn. Wetting of the plants<br>
was improved by addition of commercial surface-active substances (SAS) in the<br>
