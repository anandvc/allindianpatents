				<td>METHOD FOR PREPARING A POROUS CERAMIC MATERIAL WITH<br>
HIGH HEAT RESISTANCE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing porous<br>
ceramic materials of the type with high heat resistance, for high heat<br>
insulation, in particular for industrial applications as insulating parts for<br>
high-temperature processes, having even complex shapes obtained by<br>
extrusion or injection molding.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is known to prepare a body constituted by a porous material by<br>
mixing powders or granulates of materials of the ceramic type, generally<br>
A12O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, CSi, TiC, NSi and alkaline oxides such as Na2O,<br>
K2O, with a binder selected among organic materials such as acetic acid,<br>
sodium acetate, zinc acetate, propionic acid [1]. The process entails a<br>
reaction of the particles of metallic oxides with the binder, at a temperature<br>
below the sintering temperature at which the mixture is subjected to fire and<br>
drying.<br>
A method is also known [2] for preparing a sintered porous body<br>
made of ceramic and/or metallic materials, which includes the mixing of an<br>
aqueous suspension containing powders of ceramic or metallic materials and<br>
of a binding resin (binder) which is a water-soluble polymer which can gel,<br>
and a blowing ajgent which activates the porosity of the gel, which becomes<br>
expanded; as the temperature increases, a porous metallic-ceramic material<br>
is formed by drying and sintering and its polymeric part is eliminated by<br>
pyrolization.<br>
Another known method for preparing porous ceramic materials<br>
includes mixing ceramic powders with solid or hollow plastic pellets [4], [5]<br>
in a liquid in order to obtain a suspension, followed by drying and treatment<br>
in a high-temperature oven in an oxygen-free environment so that the plastic<br>
pellets that first act as adhesive for the ceramic powders are eliminated by<br><br>
pyrolysis, forming porosities.<br>
It is also known that silica gels dissociate in the presence of water and<br>
alkaline metal hydroxides and can be destabilized further by other<br>
components, such as for example organic components known as<br>
electrolytes, which convert silica sol into gel by means of a phase transition<br>
depending on the degree of alkalinity of the aqueous suspension of silica,<br>
generating gel systems of a different kind [3], A particular type of gel forms<br>
when the destabilization process of a colloidal solution of silica and alkaline<br>
compounds is activated by neutral reagents or acids, for example organic or<br>
mineral acids, esters and salts<br>
Known processes for obtaining porous ceramic materials with high<br>
heat resistance generally entail a technology which is highly advanced from<br>
an engineering standpoint and very complicated and laborious to obtain<br>
refractory articles having a particular shape.<br>
Moreover, in known processes, particularly advanced and<br>
sophisticated technologies which are not convenient in terms of production<br>
costs are applied to obtain large amounts of material in the industrial field.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing<br>
a porous ceramic material which is simple, inexpensive, and easy to use<br>
industrially and has a performance which can be compared with known<br>
more sophisticated and technologically advanced porous ceramic materials.<br>
An object of the present invention is also to provide a process for<br>
preparing a porous ceramic material which takes into account environmental<br>
and workplace hygiene aspects, porous ceramic materials which can be used<br>
instead of traditional materials such as mineral fibers, which are potentially<br>
pathogenic for the respiratory tract, for example due to the micrometer-size<br>
dust spread in the atmosphere during processing, and due to their skin<br>
irritation power, and also have difficulties in the disposal of the associated<br>
waste.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing a porous ceramic material which allows to fill even cavities and<br>
interspaces having a very complex shape without forming, over time, even<br>
in conditions of vibration or displacement caused by thermal expansions,<br>
dust or voids and discontinuities of the material between the interspaces.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing porous ceramic material which has no negative effects on human<br>
health.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing a porous ceramic material which allows complete recyclability of<br>
the material and the use of production residues for other applications, for<br>
example as absorbent powders for industrial oil spills and as additive for<br>
producing flameproof glass.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing a porous ceramic material in a homogeneous form with good<br>
resistance to mechanical stresses.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing a porous ceramic material which can be used as absorbent powder<br>
in case of industrial oil spills, as additive for the production of flameproof<br>
glass, and as a material having piezoelectric properties.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing a porous ceramic material for use in multilayer materials, in the<br>
form of profiles, sheets, bars, and can be worked with manual tools and<br>
machine tools<br>
This aim and these and other objects which will become better<br>
apparent from the following detailed description of the invention are<br>
achieved by the method for preparing a porous ceramic material, particularly<br>
for thermal insulation, comprising the steps of:<br>
-providing a first composition in the form of a stable aqueous<br>
colloidal solution of silica and oxides of alkaline metals;<br><br>
-	providing a second stable composition in the form of a suspension<br>
in an organic liquid of inorganic and/or organic particles, said second<br>
composition containing compounds which, when the second composition is<br>
mixed with said first composition, can destabilize said first composition,<br>
forming gel, and can form an organic polymeric mesh together with a<br>
blowing agent;<br>
-	mixing said first composition and said second composition to form a<br>
mixture;<br>
-	forming from said mixture a porous structure in gel form, where an<br>
organic structure supports inorganic structures being formed;<br>
-	solidifying said porous structure in gel form, obtaining a porous<br>
ceramic material in which an organic polymeric net surrounds inorganic<br>
parts.<br>
The method according to the present invention can further comprise<br>
the step of:<br>
-	introducing the formed gel, before solidification, in a mold, an<br>
interspace or a cavity by injection or extrusion, followed by<br>
-	solidifying the gel in situ in said mold, interspace or cavity,<br>
obtaining a porous ceramic material in which an organic polymeric net<br>
surrounds inorganic ceramic parts.<br>
Conveniently, the first composition can also comprise ceramic<br>
materials, for example ceramic materials selected from the group consisting<br>
of aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon<br>
carbide, titanium carbide, silicon nitride, ferric oxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, oxides and carbonates of alkaline and alkaline-earth metals. The<br>
oxides of alkaline metals can be selected from the group consisting of<br>
sodium oxide, potassium oxide, lithium oxide, and are preferably sodium<br>
oxide.<br>
Moreover, the first aqueous composition can comprise a<br>
polymerization catalyst.<br><br>
Examples of compounds capable of destabilizing said first colloidal<br>
composition with gel formation are organic and inorganic acids, silica,<br>
esters, ethers, anhydrides and salts of organic and inorganic acids, organic<br>
electrolytes, borates, carbonates, carbides, nitrites, nitrides, ammonium<br>
salts, oxides, peroxides, silicates, phosphates, phosphites, sulfates,<br>

composition is mixed with said first composition, an organic polymeric<br>
mesh and compounds adapted of forming a blowing agent are one or more<br>
compounds of the group constituted by organic polymerizable monomers<br>
and/or organic compounds adapted to provide, by reaction with water,<br>
organic polymerizable monomers, organic acid anhydrides, organic acid<br>
esters, organic acid alkoxy esters, salts of organic acids, ethers and organic<br>
acids and metallic acetylides.<br>
The second composition preferably comprises calcium carbide.<br>
Advantageously, the second composition can comprise calcium carbide,<br>
acetic anhydride and/or ethyl acetoacetate and/or ethyl acetate.<br>
The first composition preferably contains sodium silicate.<br>
Advantageously, the first composition contains sodium silicate and the<br>
second composition contains calcium carbide and acetic anhydride.<br>
The inorganic particles of the second composition can be selected<br>
among one or more of the compounds selected from the group consisting of<br>
calcium carbide, potassium tetraborate, calcium carbonate, sodium<br>
perborate, boric acid, calcium oxide, potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate.<br>
Moreover, the second composition can comprise an emulsifier, for<br>
example selected among the group consisting of potassium acetate, calcium<br>
carbonate, titanium dioxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium tetracarbonate,<br>

The mixing step of the method according to the present invention can<br>
be carried out for example at a temperature ranging from 10 to 120°C, at a<br><br>
subatmospheric, atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure, and at a weight<br>
ratio between said first composition and said second composition ranging<br>
from 2 to 50.<br>
The inorganic particles can have for example an average size of less<br>
than 100 micrometers, particularly ranging from 5 to 25 micrometers, but<br>
can also have a nanometer size (for example, from 5 to 3.0 run, as in the case<br>
of nanometer dust).<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
The following are some parameters which can affect the morphologic<br><br>
characteristics of the material:<br>
-	percentage of silica, modulus of the initial polysilicate solution SiO2/M2O<br>
with respect not only to Na2O but also to the other alkaline metals<br>
depending on their stability in the silanol system of the solution in H2O. For<br>
example in industrial solutions of colloidal sodium silicate, this ratio is<br>
expressed as a weight ratio R; this ratio is available in a range of solutions<br>
which are more or less rich in silica, usually from Na2O 1.6SiO2 to<br>
Na2O-3.8SiO2 and in various intermediate ratios. Another important<br>
parameter of polysilicate sols is expressed in °Bè (degrees Baumé), a value<br>
which is expressed to indicate the concentration of the solutions. Similar<br>
parameters can be found in the other solutions of colloidal silica with other<br>
alkaline metals, such as for example in potassium silicate.<br>
-	percentage and nature of the ceramic particles of mixture A which are<br>
stable and must be selected depending on the composition of the final<br>
ceramic product. In general, A12O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, SiC, TiC, SiN, CaCO3,<br>
MgCO3, Mg(OH)2, Fe2O3 and other oxides and carbonates of metals, in such<br>
percentages as to not compromise the stability of the polysilicate solution,<br>
paying particular attention to variations in pH, which must not be lower than<br>
pH 10.<br>
-	percentage and manner of the addition of the organic components in<br>
mixture B and their ratio with the other inorganic components (with<br>
particular reference to components such as calcium carbide) and of course<br>
their interaction, if any, and degree of polymerization of the organic<br>
components (which can be obtained by means of microscopic optical-<br>
chemical measurements aimed at identifying their three-dimensional<br>
structure and stability over time).<br>
-	weight ratio of the relation A/B in terms of both weight and volume, by<br>
means of their density and partial individual percentages. This ratio was<br>
verified with experimental tests as being variable, with B = 2% to 35% by<br>
weight of A.<br><br>
-	Flocculating properties (of aggregation and clustering) linked to the<br>
miscibility of suspensions A and B and of the method in its several steps.<br>
-Total rate of A+B chemical reactions in relation to their dynamic mixing.<br>
These variables are affected by the characteristics of the system used to<br>
perform their mixing.<br>
-	Viscosity and density of the suspensions A and B.<br>
-	Time and temperatures of the process.<br>
It is therefore evident that the variables of the materials and processes<br>
are certainly related to the morphologic properties of the ceramic product, in<br>
its final location after injection, the granular structure and the cells (number<br>
and size), and any diversification thereof in their structural physical<br>
properties.<br>
Substantially, the method according to the present invention<br>
comprises the mixing of two distinct stable compositions, a composition in<br>
the form of a solution or suspension of colloidal silica based on water (A)<br>
and a composition in the form of a suspension of inorganic particles in an<br>
organic liquid o in a mixture of organic liquids of (B), which can be<br>
prepared and deposited separately for a long time without undergoing<br>
modifications.<br>
In one embodiment, a new hybrid ceramic-organic material is<br>
obtained by means of the method according to the present invention by<br>
mixing:<br>
-	A stable solution A of colloidal silica comprising, in dispersion, other<br>
ceramic particles depending on the ceramic-organicized type to be<br>
developed.<br>
-	A stable suspension B of organic liquids comprising, in dispersion, other<br>
organic and inorganic particles adapted to destabilize and trigger the<br>
polymeric condensation of the suspension A in A+B.<br>
The two reacting suspensions, "A" and "B", used in the method<br>
according to the present invention are prepared separately by mixing<br><br>
uniformly first the powders in suspension in the respective solvents. In case<br>
A, they are for example: liquid sodium silicate in the state of colloidal<br>
aqueous aggregation of SiO2 with the addition of powders of metals, oxides<br>
and carbonates of metals and alkaline metals. In case B, they are for<br>
example: acetic anhydride and ethyl acetoacetate, both liquid as<br>
destabilizing agents of SiO2 of the electrolytic type, with the addition of<br>
oxides, carbonates, borates of metals and alkaline metals, once mixed with<br>
the suspension A they become responsible for the conversion from the<br>
colloidal state of the silica to a gel state depending on the pH of the mixture<br>
composed of A+B. In this phase transition, siloxane condensation occurs by<br>
using as base the organic polymeric formations, which also originate from<br>
reactions which are the result of A+B. In this hybrid organic-inorganic<br>
polymeric condensation, a network formed by the ramified chains having a<br>
three-dimensional structure is consolidated, said chains inserting in the<br>
mesh of the net polymerized chemical compounds both as silica chains and<br>
as colloidal silica particles, even and especially in the presence of alkaline<br>
substances, which occupy the large spaces of the colloidal tetrahedral<br>
structure of silica, forming, as in glass, alkaline-metal polysilicates,<br>
hydroxides and carbonates.<br>
It should be noted that the ceramic particles are not indispensable for<br>
carrying out the reaction but affect the performance of the resulting<br>
material.<br>
One might therefore summarize that for example the following steps<br>
occur during the method of the present invention:<br>
-	A dispersion 1A of the ceramic particles in a colloidal solution of silica A<br>
-	A dispersion 1B of the destabilizing particles in a mixture of organic<br>
liquids with a polymeric matrix B<br>
-	A destabilization 2 in A+B by means of organic and inorganic compounds<br>
present in B or generated by mixing A and B, which may or may not<br>
polymerize but certainly contribute to the conversion from sol to gel.<br><br>
-	The polymerization 3 of the organic elements, simultaneous with the step<br>
of siloxane condensation from sol to gel, thus allowing the formation of an<br>
organic skeleton during two processes: a process for formation expanding<br>
gases; a process of agglomeration of the polysilicate ceramic particles,<br>
which by amalgamating with the organic skeleton by way of<br>
organofunctional silanol bonds or simply interactions of ion affinity, form<br>
the porous organicized ceramic structure of the present invention.<br>
-	The drying 4 allows to accelerate the process of elimination of the excess<br>
solvent and can be carried out at temperatures ranging from 40 to 160° C<br>
without altering the morphologic properties of the material. This operation<br>
can be carried out in ovens or directly at the installation location, by using a<br>
controlled and gradual temperature rise.<br>
-	The sintering 5 is optional and allows to consolidate a three-dimensional<br>
structural construction by amalgamating the silicate alkaline metal<br>
compounds like a true ceramic, thus improving the physical features of the<br>
material. It should be noted that by raising the material to sintering<br>
temperature, pyrolization of the polymeric organic structure occurs<br>
In a particular embodiment, composition A is a stable colloidal<br>
solution of sodium silicate and composition B is a stable suspension<br>
containing calcium carbide, acetic anhydride and ethyl ester.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, composition A contains also one or<br>
more compounds selected among zirconium dioxide, calcium carbonate,<br>
alumina, magnesium carbonate, titanium oxide and aluminum.<br>
In one embodiment, composition A comprises the colloidal solution<br>
of sodium silicate and composition B comprises powder of calcium carbide,<br>
acetic anhydride and ethyl ester.<br>
In another embodiment, composition A comprises a colloidal solution<br>
of sodium silicate, powder of alumina and powder of ferric oxide and<br>
composition B comprises powder of calcium oxide, powder of calcium<br>
carbide, powder of silica, powder of potassium sulfate, acetic anhydride and<br><br>
ethyl acetate.<br>
In another embodiment, composition A comprises a colloidal solution<br>
of sodium silicate, powder of titanium dioxide, powder of alumina, powder<br>
of ferric oxide and powder of aluminum and composition B comprises<br>
potassium tetraborate, potassium acetate, calcium carbide, silica, calcium<br>
carbonate, acetic anhydride, ethyl ester and ethyl acetate.<br>
Without intending to be bound by a specific hypothesis regarding the<br>
mechanism, one can assume that the process according to the invention, in<br>
particular embodiments, occurs after the mixing of the components A and B<br>
according to the following main substeps:<br>
SUBSTEP 1<br>
-	the calcium carbide of mixture "B" reacts with the H2O of mixture "A";<br>
CaC2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2↑<br>
-	the acetic anhydride of mixture "B" reacts with H2O of mixture "A";<br>
(CH3CO)2 O + H2O → 2CH3COOH<br>
-	the ethyl ester of mixture "B" reacts with the sodium hydride (a base<br>
alcohol) of mixture "A";<br>
CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3 + 2NaOH → 2CH3COONa + C2H5OH<br>
The compounds that have formed in the first subphase react by<br>
forming organic polymers which constitute the organic skeleton. These<br>
reactions develop simultaneously, and at a higher concentration, in the<br>
formation of the porous cells due to the dual effect of the blowing agent.<br>
This agent behaves as a blowing agent, forming open and closed cells, and<br>
has the fundamental role of initiator of the organic polymeric condensation<br>
reactions.<br>
The resulting organic polymeric structure behaves like a sheath, i.e., it<br>
acts like a skeleton, wraps around the inorganic structures of the<br>
polysiJicates, providing the support required for consolidation of the<br>
siloxane chains formed by the phase transition from sol to gel.<br>
SUBSTEP 2<br><br>
-	Acetic acid combines with acetylene and reacts, producing polyvinyl<br>
acetate;<br>
CH3COOH + C2H2 → (CH2CHOCOCH3)n<br>
-	Sodium acetate combines with acetylene and water, and reacts producing<br>
polyvinyl acetate and sodium hydroxide;<br>
CH3COONa + C2H2 + H2O → (CH2CHOCOCH3)n + NaOH<br>
-	Potassium acetate combines with acetylene and water, and reacts<br>
producing polyvinyl acetate and potassium hydroxide;<br>
CH3COOK + C2H2 + H2O → (CH2CHOCOCH3)n + KOH<br>
-Ethyl alcohol combines with calcium carbide and water, and reacts<br>
producing calcium hydroxide and ethylene:<br>
2C2H5OH + 2CaC2 + H2O → 2Ca(OH)2+2C2H4↑<br>
-	Acetic acid combines with calcium carbonate and reacts, producing<br>
calcium acetate, water and carbon dioxide;<br>
2CH3COOH + CaCO3 → Ca(CH3COO)2 + H2O + CO2↑<br>
SUBSTEP3<br>
The organic polymeric chains which have formed in subphase 2<br>
undergo further reactions in the presence of the alcohol base of sodium.<br><br>
Thus, the final organic skeleton is obtained, which can be defined<br>
chemically as a polymeric condensation of secondary valency with<br><br>
intermolecular and intramolecular bonds of the ramified type of a copolymer<br>
of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate having a certain molecular<br>
weight containing impurities such as acetates of K, Ca, Na, comprising<br>
organofunctional silanol and polysilanol bonds.<br>
Simultaneously with the polymerization reactions, the pH values drop<br>
and the alkaline polysilicates condense, including the ions and other<br>
inorganic molecules that are present, which are attracted by the negative<br>
charge of the electrolytic organic components of the organic skeleton after<br>
the mixing of A+B, where formations occur of the organicized ceramizing<br>
amorphous silicates and carbonates in the glassy or crystalline state with<br>
the porosities produced by the blowing gas activities, such as predominantly<br>
C2H2 and, occasionally, CO2 and C2H4 which are present as a consequence of<br>
the composition of the reagents.<br>
Examples<br>
Merely by way of nonlimiting example for the scope of the present<br>
invention, the following examples of compositions A and B used in in the<br>
method according to the present invention are presented.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Moreover, for the sake of completeness, it should be added that it is<br>
conveniently possible to obtain different characteristics of the final material<br>
from a same initial formulation by subjecting reagent B to a thermal<br>
treatment and subsequent milling.<br>
In this regard, taking for example as reference the formulation of<br>
reagent B according to Table 5.2 of Example 5 and, more specifically, the<br>
boric anhydride and the calcium carbide contained therein, it is possible to<br>
vary important characteristics of the final ceramic material, such as the<br>
morphology and size of the cells, by subjecting a mixture of these powders<br>
to accurate mixing and melting at temperatures preferably ranging from<br>
500°C to 1500°C. At the end of the thermal treatment, the resulting material<br>
is subjected to milling and screening in order to obtain the intended particle<br>
size, which can for example range from 5 to 25 um. Optionally, it is<br>
possible to subject to the same thermal treatment also other powders<br>
together with calcium carbide, such as for example, silicon dioxide or also<br>
salts of organic acids or other organic or inorganic substances, adapting the<br>
melting temperatures appropriately. In this procedure it is not necessary to<br>
melt all the powders together, but it is sufficient to melt a single component<br><br>
to achieve the agglomeration of the other components with a higher melting<br>
point.<br>
The method according to present invention allows to obtain a porous<br>
ceramic material which comprises portions of silica, optionally aggregates<br>
of silica and of ceramic portions, which constitute a separate inorganic<br>
portion which is contained in a separate organic net which acts as a skeleton<br>
and support for the inorganic portion, for the ceramic particles, even if they<br>
are agglomerated, with porosity, in which the organic net is provided by<br>
polymerization and might not only surround the inorganic portion but be<br>
bonded to it.<br>
Although only some embodiments of the invention have been<br>
presented in the description, the person skilled in the art will understand<br>
immediately that it is in any case possible to obtain other equally<br>
advantageous and preferred embodiments.<br>
