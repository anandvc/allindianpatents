Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel functionalized polyethylene glycol-grafted polymer bound compound of general formula (3) which is useful in the preparation of library of combinatorial compounds, further used for obtaining pharmaceutical drugs and its intermediates. The invention also relates to the report of polymer bound aziridine compound of general formula (1) and polyethylene glycol grafted polymer resin of general formula (2) as novel intermediates and a process to obtain functionalized polyethylene glycol grafted polymer bound compound from these intermediates.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Solid-phase organic synthesis and combinatorial chemistry are widely used in pharmaceutical development research for preparation of libraries of potential drug substances for evaluation. Combinatorial chemistry is a collective term comprising of several recent breakthroughs in the manner of synthesizing organic molecules. In contrast to the classical approach to organic synthesis, wherein one compound at a time is obtained, combinatorial chemistry can be described as the preparation, usually on a solid support, of a group of related molecules, called libraries. In other words, combinatorial chemistry allows large numbers of molecules to be prepared and tested rapidly for biological activity and the technique is, therefore, referred to as "high-throughput screening" technology. Solid-phase organic reactions used in synthesis have been exhaustively compiled and reviewed from the point of view of an organic chemist [ref. 1-3]. For a selection of more descriptive reviews, see [4-9]. The techniques and the principles of combinatorial chemistry have been elaborated by Ferret [5]. Included in this selection are the special issues of Chemical Reviews, entirely devoted to combinatorial chemistry and describing the use of combinatorial techniques to the synthesis of nucleic acids, peptides and peptoids, benzodiazepine, heterocyclic and carbohydrates.<br>
In addition to the convenient combinatorial synthesis of selected libraries of compounds, solid phase organic synthesis offers several advantages over the classical organic synthesis. Firstly, the compounds are built on the polymer bead and hence side<br><br>
reactions are minimized. These reactions are generally safer and cleaner than the usual solution phase chemistry. Excess reagents may be used to drive the reactions to completion. The excess reagents and solvents are simply removed by filtration and then the desired compound is released from the resin beads. The compound thus obtained is generally homogenous, obviating the need for extensive purification protocols. In a more recent development, the resins carrying specific functionalities {the so-called scavenger resins) are also used to remove undesired byproducts as well inhibitors of reactions or one of the components in a reversible reaction (to drive the reaction in one direction). The best known example of phenomenal success of the solid phase organic synthesis is in the area of peptide synthesis (initiated by Merrifield) and later nucleic acid assembly which allowed automation.<br>
The products for solid-phase organic synthesis are characterized by three main parameters. The most important is probably the backbone, which is generally based on cross-linked polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB), first developed by Merrifield for solid-phase peptide synthesis. These resins are still very popular and are widely available and inexpensive. These are characterized by the degree of cross-linkage (generally 1-2%), which imparts a balance between rigidity and swelling properties, the porosity (brought about by use of a photogenic agent during polymerization) and the mesh size (generally 50-100, 70-90, 100-200 and 200-400), which is determined either by sieve analysis or air-floatation technique.<br>
Extensive researches on the linker chemistry have led to the introduction innumerable variety of anchoring groups with varying degrees of stability and application not only in solid-phase peptide synthesis and gene-assembly but also in solid-phase organic synthesis in general. The starting materials for multi-step synthesis are linked to the polymer backbone through these linker groups and after the synthesis, the final product is cleaved food the resin using a suitable reagent, which may be a strong or a weak acid or base, hydrazine, catalyst, light, etc., depending on the nature of the linker and the bond between the product molecule and the linker. As can be expected, a larger number of linkers based on carbon, silicon, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and phosphorus have already been developed and extensively used. About 25% or all organic chemistry papers in recent years are based on solid-phase organic synthesis and their proportion is growing, thus increasing the demand for these<br><br>
materials from both research laboratories and pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry.<br>
Some of the more popular resins in use for solid-phase organic synthesis, peptide synthesis and combinatorial chemistry are given below. More comprehensive lists are given in reviews like that by Guile et al. [10]. The earliest resin to be introduced is the Merrifield resin, which is a polystyrene resin cross-linked with 1-2% divinylbenzene and which is chloromethylated using chloromethyl methyl ether and stannic chloride. The Merrifield resin can be condensed with potassium phthalimide to yield phtalimido polystyrene, which on hydrzinolysis yields aminomethyl polystyrene. Chloromethyl and aminomethyl polystyrenes being the starting points for several other flinctionalised polymers, and chloromethyl methyl ether being carcinogenic, several methods are in development for alternative routes for their preparation. One such has been developed by Merrifield himself and involves direct amidoalkylation of cross-linked polystyrene using hydroxymethylphtalimide and trifluoromethyl sulphonic acid, followed by hydrazinolysis. Another recent development in obtaining more uniform Merrifield resin is to copolynerise styrene with divinylbenzene and chloromethylstyrene.<br>
The chemistry of the functional groups on the resin can be tailored to modulate the acid-sensitivity as well as acid-sensitivity of the bond between the resin and the molecule attached to it through the linker. Thus, the Merrifield resin is condensed with hydroxylmethylphenol to yield hydroxymethyl phenyloxymethyl polystyrene, other wise called Wang resin where the linkage is acid sensitive. On the other hand hydoxymethyl phenylacetamido linkage (called the PAM resin) is highly stable to acids. A linker that is extremely sensitive to acids and permit building molecules using acid-sensitive groups like proline and cysteine are the 2-chlorotrityl resin. Further modulation of the stability and sensitivity is achieved by introducing methyl, methoxy or nitro groups on the phenyl rings of the trite linker. Other popular resins link the Rink and Sidebar resins permit synthesis of amides.<br>
Swelling of the resin is another important property that determines the reactivity of the functional groups on the resin in a given solvent. Swelling renders the reactive groups more accessible to the reagents. Most of the PS-DVB resins swell appreciably in medium polar non-aqueous solvents like toluene, dichloromethane.<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxan and dimethylformamide and the resins collapse in hydroxylic solvents such alcohols and water. The solid-phase reactions therefore are generally conducted in the non-hydroxylic medium polar solvents. Recently, attempts are being made to graft hydrophilic moieties such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the PS-DVB resins to obtain what are called PEG resins or entangle resins that contain amphiphilic spacers or tentacles [11]. Hydrocarbon (methylene) spacers are also sometimes used with advantage to bring down steric hindrance due to the large polymeric backbone close to the reactive groups and to increase the stability of the linker groups.<br>

The present approach to achieve the desired objective and also advantages derived by the present invention has not been reported in the prior art. In addition, the present invention circumvents the use of hazardous ethylene oxide and controls the chain length in the process of preparation of PEG-grafted polymer resin to achieve desired swelling properties, thereby obviating the limitations associated with its preparation in the prior art process.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel PEG-grafted polymer boimd product and a convenient route to the preparation of polymer boimd N-aryl and N-aralkyl aziridines and their conversion to polyethylene glycol-grafted polymer product, which have the desired properties required for use in solid-phase organic synthesis and combinatorial chemistry. The PEG-grafted polystyrene resins, with the desirable swelling properties are generally obtained by anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide on Merrifield resin. The major problems in the process are the use of gaseous and poisonous ethylene oxide and the production of undefined chain-length of the PEG chain, which can cause changes in the functional properties of the resin. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a novel approach which does not require the use of ethylene oxide and which also allows complete control of the length and loading of the PEG chain. The novelty of the present invention also resides in the fact that, we used a new polymer-bound azirdine resin, which reacts with appropriate PEG-alcohol or its derivative to yield the desired PEG-grafted polymer resin. Both the nitrogen loading of the aziridine relative to the polymer backbone and the length of the PEG chain can be controlled to achieve the desired swelling properties of the PEG-<br><br>
grafted polymer resin used subsequently for obtaining PEG-grafted polymer bound product, and used in solid-phase organic synthesis and combinatorial chemistry for the generation of library of combinatorial compounds. Swelling properties have been often the criteria for monitoring the progress of the reaction.<br>
The polymer-bound N-aryl (1, m = 0) or N-aralkyl (1, m = 1 to 5) aziridine required for the purpose was conveniently prepared by a novel route (Scheme 1), which consisted of treating amino or aminoalkyi polymer resins respectively with ethylene dibromide in presence of an organic base to trap the hydrogen bromide formed. The aziridine resin so obtained was treated with a polyethylene glycol monoalkyl ether of desired length or molecular weight (for example, the commercially available polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether of molecular weight 350, 550, 750, 2000 daltons, etc.) in the presence of an acid catalyst to yield PEG-grafted polymer resin of the general formula (2) in Scheme-2. Another major advantage of this approach is that the product of general formula (2) still has a reactive amino group, which can be functionalised with different groups required in combinatorial chemistry to yield functionalized PEG-grafted polymer bound compound of general formula (3) in Scheme-2. Representative linker acid used are 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetyl, Rink (or Knorr), Sieber, Bayer (4'-carbonyl-2chlorotrityl), Fmoc-3-amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl) propanamide(ANP); Backbone amide linker (BAL): Phenoxypentanoic acid amide linker(PAL); Phenylacetamidomethyl(PAM); Hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA); 4-(4-Hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)butyric acid (HMPB); 5-(4-Hydroxyraethylphenoxy)pentanoic acid(HMPPA); Super Acid Sensitive Resin (SASRIN) linkers.<br>
