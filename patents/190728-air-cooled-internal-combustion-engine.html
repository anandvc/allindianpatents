				<td>The  present  invention  relates   to  an  air-cooled internal-combustion  engine   (or  an  air-water-cooled internal-combustion  engine)   having  coolxng  fins   that  enable the  cylinder  and  the  cylinder  head  of  the  air-cooled internal-combustion  engine   to  be  cooled  uniformly  with cooling  air  blown  by  a  cooling   fan  directly  mounted  on  the crankshaft.<br>
[Related  Art]<br>
An  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  disclosed  in Japanese  Utility  Model   Publication   (Kokoku)   No.   63-32903   is<br>
provided  with  a  shroud  covering   the  cylinder  and  the cylinder  head  that  radiate  heat,   and  a  cooling   fan  mounted on  the  crankshaft  to  suck  cooling  air  through  the  cooling air  inlet  opening  of  the  shroud  and  to  cool   the  cylinder and  the  cylinder  head  by  blowing  the  cooling  air  against<br>
the  cooling   fins  of   the  cylinder  and  the  cylinder  head.<br>
[Problem  to  be   Solved  by  the  Invention]<br>
In  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  disclosed in  the  cited  Japanese  utility  model  publication,   the  shroud guides   the  cooling  air  sucked  through  the  cooling  air  inlet opening  of  the  shroud  toward  the  cylinder  head.     Therefore, the   flow  of   the  cooling  air   is  blocked  by  the  cooling  fin formed  perpendicularly  to  the  center  axis  of   the  cylinder on  the  surface  of   the  cylinder  and  the  cooling  air  is unable   to   flow  smoothly  toward  the  cylinder  head  and  the cylinder   cannot  uniformly  be   cooled  along   the   center  axis thereof.<br>
In  a  space  around  the  circumference  of   the  cooling  fan covered  with  the  shroud,   a  portion  of   the   surface  of   the cylinder  on  one  side  of   a  plane   including  the  respective center  axes  of  the  crankshaft  and  the  cylinder  is  exposed satisfactorily  to   the   cooling  air  blown  by  the   cooling   fan, while  another  portion  of   the  surface  of  the  cylinder  on  the other  side  of  the  plane  is  not  exposed  satisfactorily  to the  cooling  air.     Consequently,   the'  cylinder  and  the<br>
cylinder head cannot uniformly be cooled.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem, Function and Effect] The present invention relates to improvements incorporated into an air-cooled internal-combustion engine to overcome those disadvantages and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an air-cooled internal-combustion engine comprising: a plurality of cooling fins formed on the cylinder and the cylinder head; a centrifugal cooling fan mounted on one end of the crankshaft; and a shroud covering the cylinder, the cylinder head, and the centrifugal cooling fan; characterized in that one end of each of spaces between the plurality of cooling fins opens toward cooling air blown into a cooling air inlet to a space covered with the shroud by the centrifugal cooling fan, and the lengthwise direction of the spaces between the fins is inclined at an acute angle to the flow direction of the cooling air.<br>
In the air-cooled internal-combustion engine thus constructed, the cooling air blown out through the cooling air outlet opening of the centrifugal cooling fan flows<br>
smoothly  along  the   inclined  cooling  fins  without  being-disturbed  and,   consequently,   the  cylinder  can  efficiently and  uniformly  be  cooled  with  respect  to  both  the  axial direction  and  the  circumferential  direction.<br>
According  to  the  present  invention,   the  cooling  air blown  into  the  space  covered  with  the  shroud  by  the centrifugal  cooling  fan  flows   through  one  end  of  each  of spaces  between  the  plurality  of   cooling   fins   into   the spaces   and  flows   smoothly  along   the  surface  of   the  cooling fin.      Therefore,   even  if   the  cooling  air  contains  a  large amount   of  dust,   the  dust  will  not  adhere  to   or  deposit  on the   cooling  fins  and  the  dust   is   surely  discharged  outside the   shroud  and,   therefore,    the  deterioration  of   the  cooling performance  due  to  dust  deposition  can  be  prevented.<br>
In   the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine   stated the  cooling  air  sucked  from  outside   the  shroud into  the  space  covered  with  the  shroud  by  the  centrifugal cooling  fan  can  be  blown  so  as  to  flow  smoothly  along  the cooling   fins   of  the  cylinder  and  the  cylinder  head  to  cool the  cylinder  and  the  cylinder  head  effectively.<br>
In  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  stated since  the,centrifugal   cooling  fan  can  be  disposed at  a  position  on  the  center  axis  of  the  crankshaft  and separated  from  the  center  axis  of   the  cylinder,   a  one-way clutch  included  in  a   starting  system,   a  generator,   and  the output  shaft  can  be  arranged  in  a  space  between  the cylinder  and  the  centrifugal  cooling  fan  to  form  the  air-cooled   internal   combustion  engine   in  a  compact construction.<br>
In  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine   stated<br>
_	-the   flow  of   the  cooling  air  blown  through  the<br>
cooling  air  outlet  opening  of   the  centrifugal   cooling   fan into  each  of  the   spaces  between  the   cooling  fins   is directed  into  two  directions  by  the  cooling  fin  bend  in  a V-form  so  that  the  cooling  air  flows  along  the  spaces between  the  cooling  fins  and,   consequently,   the  wide surface  of  the  cylinder  can  uniformly  be  cooled.<br>
In  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  stated<br>
â 	âthe  cooling  air  blown  through  the  cooling  air<br>
outlet   opening  of   the   centrifugal   cooling   fan   into   the spaces  between  the  plurality  of  cooling  fins  curved  in  a helical   form  flows  along  the  helical  cooling  fins,   so  that the  cylinder  can  uniformly  be  cooled  with  respect  to  the axial  direction  and  the  circumference  direction.<br>
In  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  stated<br>
	.âpart  of  the  cooling  air  which  has  not  exchanged<br>
heat  with  the  cooling  fins   to  a  maximum  extent  and  having  a comparatively   low  temperature   flows   through  the   air  intake system  which  is   liable   to  be  heated  by  heat   transferred thereto   from  the  combustion  chamber  of   the  internal-combustion  engine.      Therefore,   the  air  intake   system  can effectively  be  cooled  by  the   cooling  air  of  a  comparatively low  temperature  to  maintain  the  charging  efficiency  on  a high  level.     The  exhaust  system  heated  to  a  high temperature  can  effectively  be   cooled  by  the   cooling  air being  discharged  outside  the  shroud  through  the  air  outlet opening.<br><br>

[Embodiments] A  preferred  embodiment  according  to  the  present<br>
invention  will  be  described  with  reference   to   Figs.   1   to   7.<br>
A  scooter  type  motorcycle  1,   which  may  be  a  three-wheel  vehicle  with  one   front  wheel  and  two  rear  wheels  or  a four-wheel  vehicle  with  two  front  wheels  and  two  rear wheels,   has  a  swing  power  unit  2.     The  swing  power  unit  2 comprises   an  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  3   having a  cylinder  block  14  extending  forward  and  inclined  slightly upward  from  a  horizontal  plane  and  a  cylinder  head  15 attached  to  the   front  end  of   the  cylinder  block  14,   and  a  V belt   type  continuously  variable   speed  transmission   4 extending   rearward  on   the   left   side   of   the   air-cooled internal-combustion  engine  3   and  combined  with   the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  3.      A  rear  wheel   6   is mounted  on  the  output   shaft   5   of   the  V  belt   type continuously  variable  speed  transmission  4.      A  pair  of hangers   7   formed  on  the  upper  wall  of  the  crankcase  of  the air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine  3   and  transversely spaced  apart  from  each  other  are  connected  pivotally  for vertical  movement  to  brackets   9  projecting  downward  from the  rear  frame  8  of  the  scooter  type  motorcycle  1  by  a linkage   10.     A  shock  absorbing  device  11  has   a   lower  end joined  to  the  rear  part  of  the  swing  power  unit  2   and  an<br>
upper  end  joined  to   the  rear  part  of   the  rear   frame  8  and enables   the  swing  power  unit   2   to  swing   in  a  vertical  plane according  to   the  undulation  of  the  road  while   the  scooter type  motorcycle  1  is  traveling.<br>
As   shown  in  Fig.   3,   the  swing  power  unit  2   comprises   a left  crankcase  12   serving  as   the  crankcase  of  the  air-cooled  internal-combustion  engine   3   and  the   transmission case  of   the  V  belt   type  continuously  variable  speed transmission  4,   a  right  crankcase  13,   a  cylinder  block  14 joined  to   the   left   crankcase   12   and  the   right   crankcase   13, the  cylinder  head  15  attached  to   the   front  end  of   the cylinder  block  14,   a  transmission  cover   16    (Fig.   1) detachably  joined  to  the   left   side  of   the   left  crankcase 12,   and  a  right  cover  17   joined  to   the  right   crankcase   13. A  fan  cover  18  covering  a  centrifugal   cooling   fan  26,   which will  be  described  later,   is  attached  detachably  to  the right  side  of   the  right  cover  17.     An  upper  cylinder  shroud 19   and  a   lower  cylinder  shroud  20   are  put   on  a  projection 21   formed  on  the  cylinder  head  15   and  are  detachably attached  to  the  left  crankcase  12,   the  right  crankcase  13, the  right  cover  17  and  the  fan  cover  18   so  as   to  cover  the<br>
cylinder  block  14  and  the  cylinder  head  15.<br>
The  cylinder  block  14  and  the  cylinder  head  15  are provided  on  their  outer  surfaces  with  cooling  fins  23   and 24  arranged  at  predetermined  intervals  respectively.     The rotor  25  of  a  generator  is  mounted  on  the  right  end  of  the crankshaft  22  within  a  space  covered  with  the  right  cover 17,   and  a  centrifugal  cooling  fan  26   is   combined  integrally with  the  rotor  25  within  a  space  covered  with  the   fan  cover 18.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig.   4,   the  crankshaft  22  and  the centrifugal   fan  26   rotate  clockwise  as  viewed  from  the right  side  of  the  body.      The  upper  half  of  a  cooling  air passage  27  defined  by  the  fan  cover  18   is   formed  in  a clockwise  spiral   form  continuously  receding   from  the  center axis   of   the  crankshaft   22.      The   right   cover   17   is  provided intermittently  with  partition  walls  28  arranged  along  a spiral   to  form  a  space  29   of  a  form  similar  to  that  of  the cooling  air  passage  27.<br>
The  cooling  fins   23   of   the  cylinder  block  14   are  bent<br>
in  a  V-form  as  shown  in  Fig.   7  along  a  line  Z   intersecting a  plane  OY  extending  upward  at  an  angle  of   45 Â°â¡  to a<br>
horizontal  plane  from  the  center  axis  of   the  cylinder  block 14  on  the  right  side  of  the  body   (in  Fig.   5,   on  the  left side  of   the  body  because  Fig.   5   is  a  front  view  taken  from the   front)   as  shown  in  Fig.   5.      The  upper  parts   23a  of   the cooling  fins  extending  above  the  boundary  line  Z  are inclined  at  an  angle  of   45 Â°â¡     toward  the   front   of   the  body and  to   the  left  as   shown  in  Fig.   3.      The  upper  portions  of the  right  parts   23b  of   the  cooling  fins  extending  below  the boundary  line  Z  are  declined  toward  the   front   of   the  body at  an  angle  of   45 Â°â¡     and  the   lower  portions   of   the  right parts   23b  are  bent   gradually  downward   so   as   to   extend  along the   surface  of   the  cylinder  block  14  perpendicularly  to   the center  axis  of   the  cylinder  block  14.      The   left   parts   23c and  the   lower  parts   23d  of   the  cooling   fins   extend  along the  circumferential  direction.<br>
Ail   the  cooling  fins   24   of   the  cylinder  head  15   extend around  the  cylinder  head  15  perpendicularly  to  the  center axis.<br>
The   fan   cover   18   is   provided  with   an   air   inlet   opening 3 0   coaxially  with  the  centrifugal  cooling  fan  26  and  is surrounded  by  a  cylindrical  wall.     A  louver  31  is   fitted  in the  air  inlet  opening  30.<br>
The  cylinder  head  15   is  provided  in   its  upper  wall with  an  intake  port  32  and  in  its   lower  wall  with  an exhaust  port,   not  shown.     An  intake  pipe  33   is   connected  to the   intake  port  32,   and  an  exhaust  pipe  34   is   connected  to the   exhaust  port.      The   upper   cylinder   shroud   19   is   provided with  an  opening   35   at   a  position   corresponding   to   the intake  port   32    (Fig.    3)    and  a   lower   cylinder   shroud   20   is provided  with  an  opening  36  at  a  position  corresponding  to the  exhaust  port.      As   shown  in  Fig.   5,   an  air  outlet opening  37   is   formed  so  as  to  open  to  the  right   at  a position  on  the  left  side   (in  Fig.   5,   on  the  right  side because  Fig.   5   is   a   front  view  taken   from   the   front)   of   the open i ng  3 6.<br>
In  the  embodiment  thus  constructed  as  described  with reference  to  Figs.   1   to  7,   the  centrifugal   fan  26   is  driven for  clockwise  rotation,   as  viewed  in  Figs.   2   and  4,   by  thecrankshaft 22, and then the cooling air sucked through the air inlet opening 3 0 of the fan cover 18 on the right side of the body into the space covered with the fan cover 18 flows from the lower section through the rear section into the upper section of the cooling air passage 27 and further through the space covered with the cylinder shrouds 19 and 20  as   indicated  by  the  arrows   in  Figs-   4   and  5.<br>
Most  part  of  the  cooling  air  flowing  toward  the cylinder  block  14   flows   toward  the  vicinity  of   the  boundary line   Z  nearest   to  the   outlet   end  27a  of   the   cooling  air passage   27.      Therefore,   most  part  of   the   cooling  air  is directed  in  the  vicinity  of   the  boundary   line   Z   by  the cooling   fins   23   bent   in  a  V-form  toward  upper   side  and  the right   side  of   the  cylinder  block   14  and  flows   along  the upper  parts  23a  and  the  right  parts   23b  of   the   cooling   fins 23   toward  the  cylinder  head  15.      Therefore,    cooling  air  is able  to  flow  smoothly  without  being  disturbed.      Part  of  the cooling  air  that   flows   near  the  upper  parts   23a   of   the cooling  fins   flows  along  the  left  parts  23c  and  the  lower parts  23d  of  the  cooling  fins  and  joins  with  part  of  the cooling  air  that  flows  downward  along  the  right  parts  23b<br>
of   the  cooling  fins   and  forward  along  the   lower  parts  23d of   the   cooling  fins,   and  then  the  cooling  air   is  discharged through  the  air  outlet  opening  37.<br>
The  cooling  air  flows  also  along  the  cylinder  shrouds 19  and  20  to  the  surface  of  the  cylinder  head  15,   and  then flows  along  the  cooling  fins  24  extending  perpendicularly to  the  center  axis  of   the  cylinder  block  14.      Then,   part  of the  cooling  air  makes  a  detour  to  avoid  the  upper  surface and  the   left   side   surface   of   the  cylinder  block  14   and flows   along  the   lower   surface  of   the  cylinder  block  14, while   the  rest  of   the  cooling  air   flows   along  the  right side  and  the   lower   side  of   the  cylinder  block  14,   and  then both  parts  of   the  cooling  air  are  discharged  through  the air   outlet  opening   37.<br>
Thus,   the  cooling  air   flows   smoothly  along  all   the cooling   fins   23   and  24   without  being  disturbed  and, consequently,    the  cylinder  block  14   and  the   cylinder  head 15  are  cooled  entirely,   uniformly  and  effectively  through the  cooling  fins  23   and  24.<br>
Since   the   intake  pipe   33   is   disposed  near   the  outlet end  27a  of   the  cooling  air  passage   27,    the  intake  pipe  33 is  cooled  by  the  cooling  air  of  a  comparatively  low temperature  which  has  not  yet  exchanged  heat  with  the cooling  fins  23   and  24,   so  that  the  charging  efficiency  is maintained  on  a  high  level.<br>
The  exhaust  pipe  34  of  a  very  high  temperature  is cooled  by  the  cooling  air  that  has   cooled  the  cylinder block  14   and  the  cylinder  head  15   in  the   space   covered  with the   cylinder   shrouds   19   and  2 0   and  has   been  heated  to   a comparatively  high  temperature.<br>
In  the  embodiment  shown  in  Figs.   1   to  7,    since  the generator  is  disposed  on  the  side  of   the  centrifugal cooling  fan  26,    the  cooling  air  passage  27   defined  by  the fan  cover   18   is   separated  by  a  comparatively  large  distance away   from  the   center  axis   of   the   cylinder  block   14   in  the direction  of  the  center  axis  of  the  crankshaft.      In  another embodiment  in  which  a  centrifugal  cooling  fan  26  and  a cooling  air  passage  27   are  disposed  nearer  to  a  cylinder block  14  as   stated  in  claim  5   and  shown  in  Figs.   8   and  9,<br>
the  cylinder  block  14   is  provided  with  helical  cooling  fins<br>
23	instead  of  the  cooling  fins  23   bent   in  a  V-form  and  a cylinder  head  15  may  be  provided  with  helical   cooling  fins<br>
24	substantially  parallel   to  the  helical  cooling  fins  23   of the  cylinder  block  14.      In  this  embodiment,   the  cooling  air flows  helically  around  the  entire  surfaces  of  the  cylinder block  14  and  the  cylinder  head  15  to  cool  the  cylinder block  14  and  the  cylinder  head  15  uniformly.<br>
