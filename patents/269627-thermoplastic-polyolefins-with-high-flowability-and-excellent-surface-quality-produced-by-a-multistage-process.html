				<td>This invention is in the field of thermoplastic polyolefins and more specifically reactor grade<br>
thermoplastic polyolefins (RTPO).<br>
The invention is further directed to RTPOs having high flowability and excellent surface<br>
quality, when molded into articles of manufacture, especially for automotive applications, a<br>
process for producing them and their use.<br>
Furthermore the invention is related to the use of a special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, which<br>
contains a trans-esterification product of a lower alcohol and a phthalic ester in combination<br>
with a special external donor for the production of RTPOs with high flowability and excellent<br>
surface quality.<br>
State of the art<br>
Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs), which typically comprise polypropylene and an elastomer,<br>
have many desirable properties, e.g. lightweight, durability, low costs, etc., that make them<br>
an attractive material for the construction of many interior and exterior automotive parts.<br>
There are two types of TPOs which essentially differ in their method of preparation. The first,<br>
which is commonly referred to as "compound grade TPO", is made by physically blending<br>
polypropylene with elastomer. The second, which is commonly referred to as "reactor grade<br>
TPO" (RTPO) and is more economical to produce than compound grade TPO, is made by<br>
first polymerizing propylene to polypropylene and then polymerizing elastomer components,<br>
such as ethylene and propylene, in the presence of the polypropylene.<br>
The RTPOs are known to be suitable for injection molding to produce large, shaped articles,<br>
for example for automotive applications, especially bumpers.<br>
Unfortunately the problem of optical irregularity arises during injection molding of such large<br>
articles due to the necessary long flow paths of the resin.<br>
Such surface defects, which are also known as "Tigerstripes" or flow marks, are a common<br>
problem for surface quality respectively appearance in plastic industry. Tigerstripes, as<br>
known in the plastic industry, describe a visible periodic inhomogeneity in surface gloss.<br>
Mostly these are alternating dull (or rough) and glossy (or smooth) areas on the surface of<br>
injection molded or extruded plastic parts, which surface should be glossy (or smooth) all<br>
over.<br>
Many attempts to avoid these surface defects, while keeping a good balance of other<br>
physical properties have been made in the past.<br>
It has however been found, that either the occurrence of flow marks could not be entirely<br>
prevented, or the physical properties of the polymer compositions were unsatisfactory.<br>
Furthermore it is desired that the RTPOs exhibit as high values of melt flow rate (MFR) as<br>
possible in order to improve processability of the RTPOs for injection molding.<br>
For example WO 2004/000899 describes reactor grade thermoplastic polyolefins on the<br>
basis of a polypropylene matrix material including bimodal rubber compositions, whereby the<br>
two rubber parts have differentiated Mw (respectively intrinsic viscosity IV) and the low IV<br>
rubber is ethylene rich.<br>
These RTPOs are produced in a multistage process comprising at least one slurry reactor<br>
and two gas phase reactors. A particularly preferred catalyst system is, according to WO<br>
2004/000899, a high yield Ziegler-Natta catalyst having a catalyst component, a cocatalyst<br>
and optionally an external donor, or a metallocene catalyst, having a bridged structure giving<br>
high stereoregularity and which, as an active complex, is impregnated on a carrier. No further<br>
details regarding the used catalyst and external donor are given.<br>
The RTPOs produced according to WO 2004/000899 show improved surface toughness in<br>
terms of scratch resistance and can be used for producing car interiors and exteriors, like<br>
bumpers, dashboards and the like, where improved scratch resistance properties are<br>
needed.<br>
According to the Examples the RTPOs exhibit an MFR of at most 13.2 g/10 min.<br>
From experience it is known that RTPOs, produced according to WO 2004/000899 show flow<br>
marks.<br>
EP 1 600 480 describes an improved propylene polymer composition on the basis of a<br>
polypropylene matrix material with an MFR in accordance with ISO 1133 (230°C, 2.16kg)<br>
&gt; 80 g/10 min, including bimodal rubber compositions, whereby the two rubber parts have<br>
differentiated Mw (IV) and the low IV rubber is ethylene rich.<br>
The RTPO is mixed with an elastomeric ethylene-1-octene copolymer, having an ethylene<br>
content of at least 80 mol% and having a MFR in accordance with ISO 1133 (190°C, 2.16 kg)<br>
of 3 - 100 g/10 min, and with an inorganic filler. These RTPOs are, according to EP 1 600<br>
480, suitable for automotive applications because they have excellent impact<br>
strength/stiffness balance, high flowability and are not susceptible to the occurrence of flow<br>
marks.<br>
The RTPO is produced in a multistage process using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst or a<br>
metallocene. According to the examples ZN104 (commercially available from<br>
LyondellBaseli), triethylaluminium as cocatalyst and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane as external<br>
donor are used.<br>
According to the Examples of EP 1 600 480 MFR-values of at most 100 g/10 min for the<br>
propylene matrix and of at most 17.6 g/10 min of the final RTPO can be achieved by using<br>
this combination of catalyst, cocatalyst and external donor.<br>
It is known by the art skilled man that the highest achievable MFR of the matrix of the base<br>
resin used according to EP 1 600 480 hardly exceeds 120 due to the high amounts of fines<br>
produced and high hydrogen response generated for these flowability conditions.<br>
Accordingly, although much development work has been done in the field of RTPOs, there<br>
remains a continuing search for alternative or improved RTPOs with desirable properties,<br>
such as excellent surface quality, good impact strength/stiffness balance and high flowability<br>
e.t.c.<br>
It was therefore an object of the invention to provide a propylene polymer composition, which<br>
can be injection molded into large shaped articles, which articles show no flow marks and<br>
which composition simultaneously shows a good impact strength/stiffness balance and high<br>
flowability.<br>
This object was achieved by using a special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst which contains a trans-<br>
esterification product of a lower alcohol and a phthalic ester in combination with a special<br>
external donor. Surprisingly this special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst in combination with a<br>
special external donor can be used for the production of a great variety of RTPOs with high<br>
flowability and excellent quality, like RTPOs on the basis of a polypropylene matrix including<br>
cross-bimodal rubber compositions, nucleated or non-nucleated RTPOs, with different multi-<br>
stage processes, like Borstar® from Borealis or Spheripol® from LyondellBaseli.<br>
Thus in a first aspect, the present invention is therefore directed to reactor grade<br>
thermoplastic polyolefins with high flowability and excellent surface quality comprising<br>
(A) 40 - 90 wt% of a propylene homo- or copolymer matrix with an MFR in accordance with<br>
ISO 1133 (230°C, 2.16 kg load) of &gt; 200 g/10 min and<br>
(B) 2-30 wt% of an elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer having an intrinsic viscosity<br>
IV (ISO 1628, with decalin as solvent) of  50 to 80<br>
wt% and<br>
(C) 8-30 wt% of an elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer having an intrinsic viscosity<br>
IV (ISO 1628, with decalin as solvent) of 3.0-6.5 dl/g and a propylene content of 50 to 80<br>
wt%,<br>
the reactor grade thermoplastic polyolefins being obtainable by a multistage polymerization<br>
process with at least 3 polymerization steps in the presence of a catalyst system comprising<br>
(i) a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst which contains a trans-esterification product of a lower<br>
alcohol and a phthalic ester and<br>
(ii) an organometallic cocatalyst and<br>
(iii) an external donor represented by the formula<br>
Si(OCH2CH3)3(NRxRy)<br>
wherein Rx and Ry can be the same or different and represent a hydrocarbon group<br>
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The polymer matrix (A) of the reactor grade thermoplastic polyolefins (RTPOs) according to<br>
the invention must be a polypropylene matrix (A), which is in the following called propylene<br>
matrix (A).<br>
The propylene matrix (A) can be a propylene homopolymer, a propylene copolymer or<br>
mixtures thereof, like a homo/random copolymer. However it is preferred that the propylene<br>
matrix (A) is a propylene homopolymer.<br>
The expression homopolymer used in the instant invention relates to a polypropylene that<br>
consists substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt%, preferably of at least 98 wt%, more preferably<br>
of at least 99 wt%, still more preferably of at least 99.8 wt% of propylene units. In a preferred<br>
embodiment only propylene units in the propylene homopolymer are detectable.<br>
Where the propylene matrix (A) comprises a propylene copolymer or is a homo/random<br>
propylene copolymer, the propylene copolymer comprises monomers copolymerizable with<br>
propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and C4 to C20 alpha-olefins, in<br>
particular ethylene and C4 to C10 alpha-olefins, e.g. 1-butene or 1-hexene. The comonomer<br>
content in the propylene matrix is in such a case preferably relatively low, i.e. up to 4.0 wt%,<br>
more preferably 0.1 to 3.0 wt%, still more preferably 0.2 to 2.0 wt%, yet more preferably 0.3<br>
to 1.0 wt%.<br>
The propylene matrix (A) can be unimodal or multimodal, like bimodal. However it is<br>
preferred that the propylene matrix (A) is unimodal. Concerning the definition of unimodal<br>
and multimodal, like bimodal, it is referred to the definition below.<br>
When the matrix is unimodal with respect to the molecular weight distribution, it may be<br>
prepared in a single stage process e.g. a slurry or gas phase process in a slurry or gas<br>
phase reactor. Preferably, the unimodal matrix is polymerized as a slurry polymerization.<br>
Alternatively, the unimodal matrix may be produced in a multistage process using at each<br>
stage process conditions which result in similar polymer properties.<br>
Where the propylene matrix (A) comprises two or more different propylene polymers these<br>
may be polymers with different monomer make up and/or with different molecular weight<br>
distributions. These components may have identical or differing monomer compositions and<br>
tacticities.<br>
Moreover it is preferred that the polymer matrix (A) has a rather high melt flow rate (MFR),<br>
i.e. a rather low molecular weight. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at<br>
230°C (ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR (230°C). Accordingly, it is preferred that in the present<br>
invention the propylene matrix (A) has an MFR (230°C) equal to or above 200 g/10 min and<br>
upto 500g/10min.<br>
As a further requirement of the RTPOs the elastomeric copolymers B and C must fulfill some<br>
properties so that the desired results can be achieved.<br>
Accordingly the elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (B) must comprise ethylene in a<br>
content of above 50 to 80 wt%, preferably 55 to 75 wt%.<br>
Furthermore the elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (B) must have an intrinsic<br>
viscosity IV = 2.8 dl/, preferably S 2.6 dl/g and more preferably = 2.4 dl/g.<br>
The elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (C) must comprise propylene in a content of<br>
50 to 80 wt%, preferably 55 to 75 wt%.<br>
Furthermore the elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (C) must have an intrinsic<br>
viscosity IV of 3.0 to 6.5 dl/g, preferably 3.2 to 6.0 dl/g and more preferably 3.5 to 6.0 dl/g.<br>
Like the propylene matrix (A) the elastomeric copolymers (B) and (C) can be unimodal or<br>
multimodal, like bimodal. However it is preferred that the elastomeric copolymers (B) and (C)<br>
are unimodal. Concerning the definition of unimodal and multimodal, like bimodal, it is<br>
referred to the definition below.<br>
Of course also the ratio of propylene matrix (A) and elastomeric copolymers (B) and (C) of<br>
the RTPOs has some influence on the desired properties; a straightforward example is the<br>
adjustment of the impact/stiffness balance.<br>
Thus the RTPOs comprise<br>
(a) 40 to 90 wt%, preferably 45 to 85 wt% and more preferably 50 to 80 wt% of the<br>
propylene matrix (A) based on the total amount of the RTPO,<br>
(b) 2 to 30 wt%, preferably 5 to 25 wt% and more preferably 10 to 20 wt% of the<br>
elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (B) and<br>
(c) 8 to 30 wt%, preferably 10 to 27 wt% and more preferably 15 to 27 wt% of the<br>
elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer (C) based on the total amount of the<br>
RTPO.<br>
Moreover it is appreciated that the MFR (230°C) of the RTPO is rather high, i.e. above 20<br>
g/10 min, more preferably above 25 g/10 min and most preferably above 30 g/10 min.<br>
The expressions "multimodal" or "bimodal" or "unimodal" used herein refer to the modality of<br>
the polymer, i.e. the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph of the<br>
molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight. As will be explained below,<br>
the polymer components of the present invention are produced in a sequential step process,<br>
using reactors in serial configuration and operating at different reaction conditions. As a<br>
consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific reactor will have its own molecular weight<br>
distribution. When the molecular weight distribution curves from these fractions are<br>
superimposed to obtain the molecular weight distribution of the final polymer, that curve may<br>
show two or more maxima or at least be distinctly broadened when compared with curves for<br>
the individual fractions.<br>
The RTPOs of the present invention are produced by multistage process polymerization<br>
comprising at least 3 polymerization steps, such as bulk polymerization, gas phase<br>
polymerization, slurry polymerization, solution polymerization or combinations thereof.<br>
One skilled in the art is aware of the various possibilities and polymerization reactor systems<br>
to produce RTPOs.<br>
Thus, the polymerization system can comprise one or more conventional stirred slurry<br>
reactors and/or one or more gas phase reactors. Preferably the reactors used are selected<br>
from the group of loop and gas phase reactors and, in particular, the process employs at<br>
least one loop reactor and at least two gas phase reactors. It is also possible to use several<br>
reactors of each type, e.g. one loop and two or three gas phase reactors, or two loops and<br>
two gas phase reactors, in series.<br>
Preferably the process comprises also a prepolymerization with the chosen catalyst system,<br>
as described in detail below, comprising the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, the special<br>
external donor and optionally the cocatalyst.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerisation is conducted as bulk slurry polymerisation<br>
in liquid propylene, i.e. the liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of<br>
other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein.<br>
The prepolymerisation reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 0 to 50 °C,<br>
preferably from 10 to 45 °C, and more preferably from 15 to 40 °C.<br>
The pressure in the prepolymerisation reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to<br>
maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar,<br>
for example 30 to 70 bar.<br>
The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the prepolymerisation step.<br>
However, where the solid catalyst component and the cocatalyst can be fed separately it is<br>
possible that only a part of the cocatalyst is introduced into the prepolymerisation stage and<br>
the remaining part into subsequent polymerisation stages. Also in such cases it is necessary<br>
to introduce so much cocatalyst into the prepolymerisation stage that a sufficient<br>
polymerisation reaction is obtained therein.<br>
It is possible to add other components also to the prepolymerisation stage. Thus, hydrogen<br>
may be added into the prepolymerisation stage to control the molecular weight of the<br>
prepolymer as is known in the art. Further, antistatic additive may be used to prevent the<br>
particles from adhering to each other or the walls of the reactor.<br>
The precise control of the prepolymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the<br>
skill of the art.<br>
A slurry reactor designates any reactor, such as a continuous or simple batch stirred tank<br>
reactor or loop reactor, operating in bulk or slurry and in which the polymer forms in<br>
particulate form. "Bulk" means a polymerization in reaction medium that comprises at least<br>
60wt-% monomer. According to a preferred embodiment the slurry reactor comprises a bulk<br>
loop reactor.<br>
"Gas phase reactor" means any mechanically mixed or fluid bed reactor. Preferably the gas<br>
phase reactor comprises a mechanically agitated fluid bed reactor with gas velocities of at<br>
least 0.2 m/sec.<br>
The particularly preferred embodiment of the invention comprises carrying out the<br>
polymerization in a process comprising either a combination of one loop and two or three gas<br>
phase reactors or a combination of two loops and two gas phase reactors.<br>
A preferred multistage process is a slurry-gas phase process, such as developed by Borealis<br>
and known as the Borstar® technology. In this respect, reference is made to EP 0 887 379,<br>
WO 2004/000899, WO 2004/111095, WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 and WO 00/68315<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A further suitable slurry-gas phase process is the Spheripol® process of LyondellBasell.<br>
Preferably the reactor grade thermoplastic polyolefins with high flowability and excellent<br>
surface quality according to the invention are produced by using the special Ziegler-Natta<br>
procatalysts in combination with a special external donor, as described in detail below, in the<br>
Spheripol® or in the Borstar®PP process, more preferably in the Borstar®PP process.<br>
One preferred multistage process may therefore comprise the steps of.<br>
producing a polypropylene polymer matrix in the presence of the chosen catalyst<br>
system comprising the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst in combination with the<br>
special external donor and the cocatalyst in at least one slurry reactor<br>
- transferring the slurry reactor product into a first gas phase reactor (GPR)<br>
- producing a first ethylene/propylene-copolymer in the polymer matrix in the presence<br>
of the catalyst system in said first GPR<br>
- transferring the first GPR product into a 2nd GPR<br>
- producing a second ethylene/propylene-copolymer in the polymer matrix in the<br>
presence of catalyst system in said 2nd GPR<br>
- recovering the polymer product for further processing,<br>
said 1st and 2nd ethylene/propylene mixtures having different composition ratios,<br>
respectively having different ethylene content and intrinsic viscosities, so that a bimodal<br>
rubber composition is obtained.<br>
A further preferred multistage process may comprise the steps of:<br>
producing a polypropylene polymer matrix in the presence of the chosen catalyst<br>
system comprising the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst in combination with the<br>
special external donor and the cocatalyst in at least one slurry reactor<br>
- transferring the slurry reactor product into a first gas phase reactor (GPR),<br>
- wherein the slurry reactor product is further polymerized in the presence of the<br>
catalyst system in said first GPR<br>
- transferring the first GPR product into a 2nd GPR<br>
- producing a ethylene/propylene-copolymer in the polymer matrix in the presence of<br>
catalyst system in said 2nd GPR<br>
- transferring the 2nd GPR product into a 3rd GPR and producing a second<br>
ethylene/propylene-copolymer in the polymer matrix in the presence of catalyst<br>
system in said 3rd GPR, said 1s' and 2nd ethylene/propylene mixtures having different<br>
composition ratios and<br>
- recovering the polymer product for further processing,<br>
yielding a polypropylene polymer matrix containing said 1st and 2nd ethylene/propylene<br>
mixtures having different composition ratios, respectively having different ethylene<br>
content and intrinsic viscosities, so that a bimodal rubber composition is obtained.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the composition ratios of said first and second ethylene/propylene<br>
mixtures are adjusted so that in the first gas phase reactor (respectively second GPR) a<br>
propylene rich EPR rubber is produced in the propylene polymer matrix and in the second<br>
gas phase reactor (respectively third GPR) an ethylene rich EPR rubber is produced in the<br>
propylene polymer matrix.<br>
Furthermore a molar H2/C2 ratio between preferably 0.01 to 0.1, more preferably 0.02 to 0.06<br>
should be adjusted in the 1st GPR (respectively 2nd GPR) and a molar H2/C2 ratio between<br>
preferably 0.15 to 0.6, more preferably 0.20 to 0.4 should be adjusted in the 2nd GPR<br>
(respectively 3rd GPR) to achieve the desired intrinsic viscosities of the two different rubbers.<br>
Nevertheless the GPR polymerisations can also be carried out in reversed order.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned preferred slurry-gas phase process, the following<br>
general information can be provided with respect to the process conditions:<br>
The slurry reactor is operated at temperature of from 40°C to 110°C, preferably between<br>
50°C and 100°C, in particular between 60°C and 90°C, with a pressure in the range of from<br>
20 to 80 bar, preferably 30 to 60 bar, with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control<br>

reactor, is then transferred to the subsequent gas phase reactor, wherein the temperature<br>
preferably is within the range of from 50°C to 130°C, more preferably 60°C to 100°C, at a<br>
pressure in the range of from 5 to 50 bar, preferably 8 to 35 bar, again with the option of<br>
adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight, with the option of adding hydrogen<br>
in order to control the molecular weight in a manner known per se.<br>
The average residence time can vary in the reactor zones identified above. In one<br>
embodiment, the average residence time in the slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor, is<br>
in the range of from 0.5 to 5 hours, for example 0.5 to 2 hours, while the residence time in<br>
the gas phase reactor generally will be from 1 to 8 hours.<br>
If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical<br>
conditions in the slurry, preferably loop reactor, and/or as a condensed mode in the gas<br>
phase reactor.<br>
The polymerization process enables highly feasible means for producing and further tailoring<br>
the propylene polymer composition within the invention. The precise control of the<br>
polymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the skill of the art.<br>
According to the invention the RTPOs with high flowability and excellent surface quality are<br>
obtained by a multistage polymerization process, as described above, in the presence of a<br>
catalyst system comprising as component (i) a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst which contains a<br>
trans-esterification product of a lower alcohol and a phthalic ester.<br>
The procatalyst used according to the invention is prepared by<br>
a) reacting a spray crystallized or emulsion solidified adduct of MgCl2 and a C1-C2 alcohol<br>
with TiCI4<br>
b) reacting the product of stage a) with a dialkylphthalate of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein R1' and R2' are independently at least a C5-alkyl<br>
under conditions where a transesterification between said C1-C2 alcohol and said<br>
dialkylphthalate of formula (I) takes place to form the internal donor<br>
c) washing the product of stage b) or<br>
d) optionally reacting the product of step c) with TiCl4.<br>
The procatalyst is produced as defined for example in the patent applications WO 87/07620,<br>
WO 92/19653, WO 92/19658 and EP 0 491 566. The content of these documents is herein<br>
included by reference.<br>
First an adduct of MgCI2 and a C1-C2 alcohol of the formula MgCI2*nROH, wherein R is<br>
methyl or ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is formed. Ethanol is preferably used as alcohol.<br>
The adduct, which is first melted and then spray crystallized or emulsion solidified, is used as<br>
catalyst carrier.<br>
In the next step the spray crystallized or emulsion solidified adduct of the formula<br>
MgCI2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is contacted with<br>
TiCl4 to form a titanised carrier, followed by the steps of<br>
• adding to said titanised carrier<br>
a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) with R1' and R2' being independently at least a C5-<br>
alkyl, like at least a C8-alkyl or being the same and being at least a C5-alkyl, like at<br>
least a C8-alkyl<br>
to form a first product<br>
• subjecting said first product to suitable transesterification conditions, i.e. at a<br>
temperature between 100 to 150 °C, such that said methanol or ethanol is<br>
transesterified with said ester groups of said dialkylphthalate of formula (I) to form<br>
preferably at least 80 mol%, more preferably 90 mol%, most preferably 95 mol%, of a<br>
dialkylphthalate of formula (II)<br><br>
with R1 and R2 being methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl, being the internal donor and<br>
• recovering said transesterification product as the procatalyst composition.<br>
The adduct of the formula MgCI2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is in a<br>
preferred embodiment melted and then the melt is preferably injected by a gas into a cooled<br>
solvent or a cooled gas, whereby the adduct is crystallized into a morphologically<br>
advantageous form, as for example described in WO 87/07620.<br>
This crystallized adduct is then used as the catalyst carrier and reacted to the procatalyst<br>
useful in the present invention as described in WO 92/19658 and WO 92/19653.<br>
In the next step the crystallized carrier is reacted with TiCl4 to form a titanised carrier.<br>
A dialkylphthalate of formula (I) is then added to this titanised carrier.<br>
The alkoxy group of the phthalic acid ester used comprises at least 5 carbon atoms and may<br>
be different or the same. Preferably the alkoxy group of the phthalic acid ester used<br>
comprises at least 8 carbon atoms. More preferably the alkoxy groups R1 and R2 are the<br>
same.<br>
Still more preferably a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) selected from the group consisting of<br>
propylhexylphthalate (PrHP), dioctylphthalate (DOP), di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP), and<br>
ditridecylphthalate (DTDP) is used, yet most preferably the dialkylphthalate of formula (1) is a<br>
dioctylphthalate (DOP), like di-iso-octylphthalate or diethylhexylphthalate, in particular<br>
diethylhexylphthalate.<br>
When adding the dialkylphthalate of formula (I) it is very likely that an adduct of all the<br>
components is produced.<br>
This adduct is then transesterified at a temperature above 100°C and advantageously<br>
between 130 to 150 °C.<br>
As the catalyst residue is removed by extracting, an adduct of the titanised carrier and the<br>
internal donor is obtained, in which the group deriving from the ester alcohol has changed.<br>
In case sufficient titanium remains on the carrier, it will act as an active element of the<br>
procatalyst.<br>
Otherwise the titanisation is repeated after the above treatment in order to ensure a sufficient<br>
titanium concentration and thus activity.<br>
Preferably the procatalyst used according to the invention contains 2.5% by weight of<br>
titanium at the most, preferably 2.2% by weight at the most and more preferably 2.0 % by<br>
weight at the most. Its donor content is preferably between 4 to 12% by weight and more<br>
preferably between 6 and 10 % by weight.<br>
More preferably the procatalyst used according to the invention has been produced by using<br>
ethanol as the alcohol and dioctylphthalate (DOP) as dialkylphthalate of formula (I), yielding<br>
diethylphthalate (DEP) as the internal donor compound.<br>
Still more preferably the catalyst used according to the invention is the BC-1 catalyst of<br>
Borealis or the catalyst Polytrack 8502, commercially available from Grace.<br>
In a further embodiment, the Ziegler-Natta procatalyst can be modified by polymerising a<br>
vinyl compound in the presence of the catalyst system, comprising the special Ziegler-Natta<br>
procatalyst, an external donor and a cocatalyst, which vinyl compound has the formula:<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 together form a 5- or 6-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic ring<br>
or independently represent an alkyl group comprising 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the modified<br>
catalyst is used for the preparation of the polymer composition. The polymerised vinyl<br>
compound can act as a nucleating agent.<br>
Concerning the modification of catalyst reference is made to the international applications<br>
WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 and particularly WO 00/68315, incorporated herein by<br>
reference with respect to the reaction conditions concerning the modification of the catalyst<br>
as well as with respect to the polymerization reaction.<br>
For the production of the RTPOs with high flowability and excellent surface quality according<br>
to the invention the catalyst system used preferably comprises in addition to the special<br>
Ziegler-Natta procatalyst an organometallic cocatalyst as component (ii). Accordingly it is<br>
preferred to select the cocatalyst from the group consisting of trialkylaluminium, like<br>
triethylaluminium (TEA), dialkyl aluminium chloride and alkyl aluminium sesquichloride.<br>
Component (iii) of the catalysts system used is an external donor represented by the formula<br>
Si(OCH2CH3)3(NRxRy)<br>
wherein Rx and Ry can be the same or different a represent a hydrocarbon group having 1 to<br>
12 carbon atoms.<br>
Rx and Ry are independently selected from the group consisting of linear aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, branched aliphatic hydrocarbon group<br>
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms. It is in particular preferred that Rx and Ry are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, octyl, decanyl, iso-propyl, iso-butyl, iso-pentyl,<br>
tert.-butyl, tert.-amyl, neopentyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl and cycloheptyl.<br>
More preferably both Rx and Ry are the same, yet more preferably both Rx and Ry are an<br>
ethyl group.<br>
Most preferably diethylaminotriethoxysilane is used as external donor.<br>
The external donor may be produced according to the methods disclosed in EP 1 538 167.<br>
The content of this document is herein included by reference.<br>
The current invention also provides a multistage process for producing reactor grade<br>
thermoplastic polyolefins using the special catalyst system comprising components (i), (ii)<br>
and (iii).<br>
Preferably the catalyst system used comprises<br>
a) a procatalyst composition comprising titanium, magnesium, chlorine and<br>
diethylphthalate as internal donor, prepared as disclosed above,<br>
b) diethylaminotriethoxysilane as external donor and<br>
c) triethylaluminium as cocatalyst.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is therefore the use of a catalyst system comprising<br>
a) a procatalyst composition comprising titanium, magnesium, chlorine and<br>
diethylphthalate as internal donor, prepared as disclosed above,<br>
b) diethylaminotriethoxysilane as external donor and<br>
c) triethylaluminium as cocatalyst<br>
for producing a reactor grade thermoplastic polyolefin with high flowability and excellent<br>
surface quality in a multistage process including at least 3 polymerization steps.<br>
Advantageously an MFR (230°C) of the RTPO of above 20 g/10 min, more preferably above<br>
25 g/10 min and most preferably above 30 g/10 min can be reached directly with the use of<br>
the above described combination of special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst and external donor<br>
represented by the formula Si(OCH2CH3)3(NRxRy) without any need of degrading by<br>
visbreaking using peroxides.<br>
By using conventional combinations of Ziegler-Natta procatalysts and external donors, as for<br>
example ZN104 or the procatalyst described previously and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane,<br>
such high MFR-values for the RTPOs can be achieved only by degrading with peroxides.<br>
Due to such a degrading step peroxide residues remain in the end polymer leading to a<br>
decrease of purity and increase in odour causing components.<br>
Furthermore, by using the above described combination of special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst<br>
and external donor represented by the formula Si(OCH2CH3)3(NRxRy). it is possible to<br>
achieve high MFR-values (230°C) of equal to or above 200 g/10 min for the propylene<br>
matrix, with considerably less amounts of fines produced compared to processes using the<br>
combination of conventional ZN104 catalyst and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane as external<br>
donor.<br>
The RTPOs according to the invention may comprise conventional adjuvants, such as<br>
additives, fillers and reinforcing agents or additional impact modifiers.<br>
The following are optional additives: elastomers, nucleating agents, process and heat<br>
stabilisers, UV stabilizers, slip agents, antistatic agents, pigments and other colouring agents<br>
including carbon black. Depending on the type of additive, these may be added in an amount<br>
of 0.001 to 10 wt % based on the weight of the RTPO.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composition includes 1 to 15wt% based on the<br>
weight of the polymer composition, of one or more elastomers. Examples of suitable<br>
elastomers include an ethylene/alpha-olefin random copolymer, an ethylene/alpha-<br>
olefin/non-conjugated polyene random copolymer, a hydrogenated block copolymer and<br>
other elastic polymers or mixtures thereof. Preferred elastomers are elastomeric ethylene-1-<br>
octene copolymers.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the polymer composition includes 0.05 to 3 wt% based on<br>
the weight of the polymer composition of one or more alpha-nucleating agents such as<br>
dibenzylidene sorbitol, sodium benzoate, methylen-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)-phosphate<br>
sodium salt (NA-11), aluminium hydroxyl-bis[2,4,8,10-tetrakis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-hydroxy-<br>
12H-dibenzo-[d,g]-dioxa-phoshocin-6-oxidato] (NA-21) and di(alkyl-benzylidene)sorbitol or<br>
mixtures thereof. The alpha-nucleating agent is usually added in small amounts of 0.0001 to<br>
1 wt%, more preferably 0.001 to 0.7 wt%. Since talc can act both as a nucleating agent and<br>
as filler, it can be added in higher amounts. When added as a nucleating agent, talc is<br>
preferably added in an amount of 0.05 to 3 wt%, more preferably 0.1 to 2 wt%, most<br>
preferably less than 1 wt%, based on the weight of the polymer composition. Further details<br>
about these nucleating agents can be found e.g. in WO 99/24479 and WO 99/24501.<br>
Molding resin formulations comprising the RTPO produced according to the invention may<br>
further comprise 5 to 60 wt% of one or more particulate of fibrous reinforcing fillers such as<br>
glass fiber or carbon fiber, graphite, carbon black or the like, or fillers such as clay, talc and<br>
mineral fillers and the like commonly employed in the trade for the manufacture of molded<br>
articles and extruded goods.<br>
It is thus a preferred embodiment of the present invention to add 5 to 25 wt% of an inorganic<br>
filler, more preferably of talc.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the additives are added to the RTPO, which is collected from<br>
the final reactor of the series of reactors. Preferably, these additives are mixed into the<br>
composition prior to or during the extrusion process in a one-step compounding process.<br>
Alternatively, a master batch may be formulated, wherein the RTPO is first mixed with only<br>
some of the additives.<br>
For mixing, a conventional compounding or blending apparatus, e.g. a Banbury mixer, a 2-<br>
roll rubber mill, Buss-co-kneader or a twin screw extruder may be used. The polymer<br>
materials recovered from the extruder are usually in the form of pellets. These pellets are<br>
then preferably further processed, e.g. by injection molding to generate articles and products<br>
of the inventive RTPOs.<br>
RTPO compositions according to the invention may be pelletized and compounded using any<br>
of the variety of compounding and blending methods well known and commonly used in the<br>
resin compounding art.<br>
The compositions of the current invention are preferably used for the production of molded<br>
articles, preferably injection molded articles. Even more preferred is the use for the<br>
production of automotive parts, like bumpers, spoilers, fenders, body panels, side bump<br>
strips and the like.<br>
The current invention also provides articles comprising the inventive RTPOs with high<br>
flowability and excellent surface quality. Preferably, these articles are produced by injection<br>
molding.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that the molded articles manufactured with the RTPO resins<br>
prepared according to the invention display excellent surface quality.<br>
The surface quality of injection molded parts, which is determined according to the procedure<br>
described in the experimental section, must be "excellent", i.e. only polymer compositions<br>
which can be injection molded without showing any flow mark, solve the problem which is<br>
underlying the present invention.<br>
Examples:<br>
Methods:<br>
Melt Flow Rate<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the melt flow rate is measured as the MFR in accordance with<br>
ISO 1133 (230X, 2.16 kg load) for polypropylene and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is<br>
an indication of the flowability, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the<br>
melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer.<br>
Comonomer content was measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)<br>
calibrated with 13C-NMR. When measuring the ethylene content in polypropylene, a thin film<br>
of the sample (thickness about 250 mm) was prepared by hot-pressing. The area of -CH2-<br>
absorption peak (800-650 cm'1) was measured with Perkin Elmer FTIR 1600 spectrometer.<br>
The method was calibrated by ethylene content data measured by 13C-NMR.<br>
Flexural modulus was measured according to ISO 178 by using injection molded test<br>
specimens as described in EN ISO 1873-2 (80 x 10 x 4 mm)<br>
Xylene solubles<br>
The xylene soluble fraction (XS) as defined and described in the present invention was<br>
determined as follows: 2.0 g of the polymer are dissolved in 250 ml p-xylene at 135 °C under<br>
agitation. After 30 minutes, the solution was allowed to cool for 15 minutes at ambient<br>
temperature and then allowed to settle for 30 minutes at 25 ± 0.5 °C. The solution was<br>
filtered with filter paper into two 100 ml flasks. The solution from the first 100 ml vessel was<br>
evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue dried under vacuum at 90 °C until constant<br>
weight is reached. The xylene soluble fraction (percent) can then be determined as follows:<br><br>
wherein m0 designates the initial polymer amount (grams), m1 defines the weight of residue<br>
(grams), v0 defines the initial volume of solvent taken (250 millilitres) and v1 defines the<br>
volume of the aliquot taken for determination (analysed sample; 100 millilitres).<br>
The intrinsic viscosity (IV) value increases with the molecular weight of a polymer. The IV<br>
values were measured according to DIN EN ISO 1628-1 in Decalin at 135°C.<br>
The tensile modulus was measured according to ISO 572-3 at 1mm/min and 23°C. Test<br>
specimens as described in EN IS01873-2 (80 x 10 x 4 mm) were used.<br>
Charpy, notches impact strength (NIS), was measured according to ISO 179/1eA at<br>
+23°C, 0°C and at -20°C by using injection molded test specimens as described in EN ISO<br>
1873-2 (80x10x4 mm)<br>
Shrinkage was measured according to an internal standard using 150x80x2 mm injection<br>
molded plaques. Measurements were performed after injection and conditioning at room<br>
temperature for at least 96h in the flow direction and perpendicular to the flow direction.<br>
Following conditions were used for injection molding: injection time: 3s, melt temperature:<br>
240°C, mold temperature: 50°C, hold pressure: from 73 to 23 bars in 10 steps, hold time: 10<br>
s, cooling time: 20s.<br>
The fines were determined by sieving the polymer powder according to ASTM D1921-06.<br>
The screen set consisted of screens having openings of 4,000 mm; 2,800 mm; 2,000 mm;<br>
1,400 mm; 1,000 mm; 0,500 mm; 0,180 mm; 0,106 mm and 0,053 mm.<br>
The powder passing the 0,180 mm screen was considered as fines.<br>
Zinc oxide was used as antistat.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of base resin according to the invention<br>
The base resin was produced in a plant having a prepolymerization reactor, a loop reactor<br>
and two fluid bed gas-reactors connected in series. The catalyst used in the polymerization<br>
was prepared according to WO 92/19653 with DOP as dialkylphthalat of the formula (I) and<br>
ethanol as alcohol, the cocatalyst was Triethylaluminium (TEA) and as an external donor (D)<br>
diethylamino triethoxy silane was used.<br>
After a first pre-polymerisation step the catalyst system was fed to the slurry reactor, where<br>
the polymerisation of the polypropylene homopolymer matrix phase was performed. The<br>
slurry phase loop reactor was then followed by a first gas phase reactor in series, in which a<br>
first elastomeric rubber disperse phase was produced by copolymerisation of propylene with<br>
ethylene comonomer. The polymerisation temperature in the slurry phase loop reactor was<br>
62°C, whereas the temperature in the first gas phase reactor was 80°C. After transfer to a<br>
second gas phase reactor the second ethylene/propylene copolymer was produced. The<br>
operating temperature in the second gas phase reactor was 80°C.<br>
The split between loop, 1st GPR and 2nd GPR was: 70.5%:17.0%:12.5%<br>
Reaction conditions:<br><br>
Values for CVEPR, IV/XS, MFR and XS of the 2nd Gas phase reactor product are total values<br>
for the final RTPO.<br>
Since the IV of the EPR produced in the 2nd Gas phase reactor (IV/XS(epr 2nd gpr)) can not be<br>
measured directly it has been calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
Where:<br>
IVtotal is the IV of the fraction soluble in xylene of the final composition<br>
Wtotal = 100% EPR [the sum of polymer splits for the 1st and the 2nd gas phase reactor (17% +<br>
12.5% = 29.5%) represents the total of EPR (100% EPR) produced]<br>
IV(EPR 1st GPR) is the IV of the fraction soluble in xylene produced in the 1st gas phase reactor<br>
w1st GpR is the percentage of EPR produced in the 1st gas phase reactor based on 100%EPR<br>
[(17%polymor split for 1stGPR X 100%EPR lotal)/29.5%sum of polymer splits for 1st and 2nd GPR]<br>
w2ndGPR is the percentage of EPR produced in the 2nd gas phase reactor based on 100%EPR<br>
[(12.5%polymer split for 2ndGPR X 100%EPR total)/29.5%sum of polymer splits for 1st and 2nd GPR]<br>
The IV of the fraction soluble in xylene produced in the 2nd gas phase reactor was therefore<br>
1.68 dl/g<br>
The Cramount of the EPR produced in the 2nd Gas phase reactor (C3/EPR(epr 2nd gpr)) has<br>
been calculated accordingly using the following formula:<br>
C3/EPR (EPR 2nd GPR) = [(C3/EPR total X Wtotal) - (C3/EPR (EPR 1st GPR) X W1st Gpr)] / W2nd GPR<br>
Where:<br>
C3/EPR total is the C3-amount of the EPR of the final composition<br>
wtotal = 100% EPR [the sum of polymer splits for the 1st and the 2nd gas phase reactor (17% +<br>
12.5% = 29.5%) represents the total of EPR (100% EPR) produced]<br>
C3/EPR (epr 1st GPR) is the C3-amount of the EPR produced in the 1st gas phase reactor<br>
W 1st GPR is the percentage of EPR produced in the 1st gas phase reactor based on 100%EPR<br>
[(17%polymer split for 1stGPR X 100%EPR total)/29.5%sum of polymer soils for 1st and 2nd GPR]<br>
w2nd GPR is the percentage of EPR produced in the 2nd gas phase reactor based on 100%EPR<br>
[(12.5%polymer split for 2ndGPR X 1 00%epr total)/29.5%sum of polymer splits for 1st and 2nd GPr]<br>
The C3-amount of the EPR produced in the 2nd gas phase reactor was therefore 33.54wt%<br>
This value complies with datas evaluated by using so-called master curves.<br>
Such master curves were generated by determining the C3-amount of an EPR produced in<br>
the first gas phase reactor of the above described reactor set up using the same catalyst<br>
system as described above but different C2/C2+C3 ratios, leading to corresponding C3-<br>
amounts in the EPR. From these master curves an art skilled person can determine the C3-<br>
amount of the EPR produced in the 2nd gas phase reactor using a special C2/C2+C3 ratio.<br>
Example 2:<br>
In order to show the advantageousness of the catalyst system used according to inventive<br>
Example 1 in comparison to the catalyst system used according to EP 1 600 480 (ZN104<br>
(commercially available from LyondellBasell), triethylaluminium as cocatalyst and<br>
dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane as external donor) regarding fines produced during production<br>
of the polypropylene matrix, several polypropylene matrices with different MFR were<br>
produced in the above described plant set up and the amount of fines produced in the loop<br>
reactor were determined by sieving the polymer powder obtained from the loop reactor.<br>
The powder passing a 0.180 mm screen was considered as fines.<br><br>
With the combination of ZN104/DCDMS it was not possible to produce a polypropylene<br>
matrix with an MFR of above 100 g/10 min, especially of 250 g/10 min due to the high<br>
amount of fines produced, which block the reactor.<br>
Example 3: Testing of the base resin<br>
The base resin (RTPO) was initially obtained in powder form.<br>
The resin together with 10 wt% Titai15 (talc from Ankerport) and 0.1% NA11 as well as 10<br>
wt% of EG8200 (elastomer Engage®8200 from DuPont Dow Elastomers) were palletized by<br>
feeding the blend to a Prism 24twin-screw extruder (Prism Ltd., Staffordshire, UK). The<br>
polymer was extruded through a strand die, cooled and chopped to form pellets.<br><br>
Surface quality (Tigerskin)<br>
Plaques of a dimension of 210x189x3mm3, grained with VW grain K50, were produced under<br>
following conditions:<br>
Melt temperature: 240°C<br>
Mold temperature: 30°C<br>
Dynamic pressure: 10 bar hydraulic<br>
The filmgate over the whole width had a thickness of 1,4mm.<br>
With the above mentioned conditions 5 plaques with different injection speed were produced.<br>
The test series were done with following screw advance velocities:<br>
10, 20, 42, 60, 75 mm/sec, where the screw diameter was 50mm and different injection times<br>
of 8, 4, 2, 1.5 and 1 sec.<br>
The produced plaques are judged visually by a tester in terms of tigerskin.<br>
The tigerskin level was assessed by a number between 1 (no flow mark "excellent") and 5 (a<br>
large area of flow marks, "insufficient") according to Figure 3.<br><br>
Result: With the RTPO of the present invention no flow marks could be seen, independently<br>
of the test conditions; the surface quality was in each case excellent.<br>
