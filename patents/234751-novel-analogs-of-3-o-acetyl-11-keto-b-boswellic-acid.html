Novel Analogs of 3-O-Acety1-ll-Keto-β-Boswellic acid<br>
This invention relates to novel structural analogs of 3-O-Acety1-ll-Keto-β-Boswellic acid (AKBA).<br>
Technical field:<br>
Presently, there has been a tremendous surge in demand for non-stercidal plant based antiflammatory agents. 5-Lipoxygenase is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and 5(S)-HETE, the important mediators for inflammatory, allergic and obstructive process, from arachidonic acid. 5-Lipoxygenase is the target enzyme for identifying inhibitors, which have potential to cope with a variety of inflammations and hypersensitivity-based human diseases including asthma, arthritis, bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and circulatory disorders such as shock and ischaernia. Scientists around the world have invested a major effort during the last ten years, in identifying 5-Hpoxygenase inhibitors.<br>
Gum resin of Boswellia species known as Indian frankincense has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in Traditional Ayurvedic Medicine in India. Ancient Ayurvedic texts described its therapeutic use. Clinical trails performed by CSIR laboratories in India have shown fair to excellent results in 88% of the patients, with no adverse side effects [Singh, G.B.t Status report, anti-inflammatory drugs from plant sources (1982)]. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials on patients with Osteo-arthritis of knee exhibited statistically significant improvement in the pain, decreased swelling and increased knee flexion etc. [Kimmatkar, Phytomedicine 10: 5-7 (2003)]. The therapeutic effects shown by Boswellia serrata extract were comparable to those exhibited by sulfasalazine and mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. (Gupta, I., et al, Eur. 1 Med Res., 3: 511-14, 1998 and Gerhardt, H., et. al, GastroenieroL 39: 11-17, 2001). The source of anti-inflammatory actions has been attributed to boswellic acids (Safayhh H., et al, Planta Medica 63, 487 - 493, 1997 and 1 Pharmacol Exp. Then 261. 1143 - 46. 1992, both the journals published from USA), a group of triterpene acids isolated from the Boswellia resin (Pardhy, R. S., et aL, Indian J.Chem.16B. 176 - 178,<br><br>
WO 2005/123649	PCT/IN2004/OWI76<br>
1978). These compounds exert anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-iipoxygenase (5-LO). Immunomodulatory activity of boswellic acids had been reported by Sharrna et. al. in Phyioihcraph)' Research. (1O. 107 - 112. 1996), published from USA. A detailed study on the structural requirements for boswellic acids indicated that, of all the six boswellic acids, 3-O-acetyl-l 14;eto-β-boswellic acid, hereinafter referenced as AKBA shows most pronounced inhibitory activity against 5-LO (Sailer, E- R-, e: aL British J. Pharmacology 117. 615-618, 1996). AKBA acts by unique mechanism. in which it binds to 5-LO in a calcium-dependent and reversible manner and acts as a non-redox-type, non-competitive inhibitor (Sailer, E. R., et al., Euro. J. Biochem- 256. 364 - 368, 1998). AKBA has thus become the subject of intensive research for its potential for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.<br>
The oleanane and ursane triterpenoids also gained prominence recently for their antiproliferative actions. As 5-Iipoxygenase (5-LO).is the first enzyme in the metabolic pathway leading to the formation of leukotrienes and eicosanoids thai are important in carcinogenesis process, inhibitors of 5-LO may thus have profound influence on the growth and apoptosis of various cancer lines (Yong S. Park, et. al. Planta Medico, 68, 397-401, 2002). Boswellic acids, for example inhibited several leukemia cell lines in vitro and inhibited melanoma growth and induced apoptosis (Hostanska. K., et aL Anticancer Res.f 22(5), 2853 -62. 2002). The acetyl boswellic acids were found to be unique class of dual inhibitors of human topoisomerases I and II a(Syrovets, T. et aL, , MoL PharmacoL, 58 (1), 71 - 81, 2000). A number of oleanane and ursane triterpenoids were found to be powerful inhibitors of nitric oxide production in macrophases. which can be correlated to their cancer chemoprevention activity. (Honda, T., eL al- J. Med. Chem., 43, 1866-1877).<br>
Background Art:<br>
5-Lipoxigenase inhibitory properties of AKBA and other boswellic acids have been scientifically established. Efforts are currently being made to enrich AKBA in the natural extracts and also to synthesize structural analogs of AKBA with enhanced potency and water solubility.<br><br>
WO 2005/123*19	PCTTN2l*ut OOOI'b<br>
Disclosure of tic invention:<br>
The organic sorvenr extract of The gum resin of Bosweilia serrata contain a total of six bcswellic acids. These acids are shown in figure 1, and are represented by Bl. B2. B3. B4, B5 and B6. The concentration of most active principle B2 (AKBA) amounts only in the range of 1-10%. but most typically in -the range of 2-3%. The enrichment of AKBA from natural boswellic extract has already been undertaken by the inventors and escnDed in international. patent application (PCT#03/074063.dtd 12th september 2003) and US patent application (US#2004073060. The potential usefulness of boswellic acids in general and AKBA in particular can be a great incentive ID take-up further development of these compounds in all possible aspects. The present invention, is related to development of novel structural analogs of AKBA by serri-synthesis from 11-keto-β-bosweliic add (KBA) or 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) for biological evaluation and to conduct structure activity relationship studies. The core objective of this invention is to obtain novel AKBA type compounds with enhanced biological activity and improved water solubility for use in therapeutic applications as anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and anti-tumor agents.<br>
A systematic study on the boswellic acids analog development has not been undertaken, so far, except the preparation of some afylidene analogs of 3-keto-{3-boswellic acid (Gupta, V. N. et al., Indian Drugs, 25(2), 70 - 72, 1987). The major functional moieties that can be expended to make novel structural analogs of AKBA are acetoxyl, carboxyl and enone. Two major types of compounds were primarily envisioned for the development of new analogs of AKBA. One type constitutes a group, which differ in the nature of the acyioxy group on C3 of the ring A The other group contains compounds obtained by modification of carboxyl group on C4 of the unit A.<br><br><br><br>

Novel compounds of this invention may be prepared by the following processes.<br>
The compounds represented by 2 to 11 may be prepared by a coupling reaction between KBA or its ester with an appropriate acid counterpart using DCC (1.3-diclohexylicarbodiimide) and DMAP {4-(dimethylandno)pyridine} as coupling agent in a. suitable solvent system. This may also be accomplished by convening the acid corresponding to the acyloxy unit to the add chloride using SOCb (thionyl chloride) and then treating the acid chloride with KB A or its methyl ester, in the presence of an organic base The compounds represented by 12, 13, 14 and 15 may be prepared by displacing the 3α OH group in methyl ester of KBA by Br using PBr3 (phosphorus tribromide) and then further displacing the Br group with appropriate nucleophnic agents, such as SH', CN' etc. These reaction sequences are shown hereinafter in scheme I.<br>
The amide compounds represented by 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 may be prepared by treating the acid chloride of AKBA with an excess of amine component in a suitable solvent system. This reaction scheme is shown in the scheme EL below.<br>
The isocyanate and amine compounds represented by the structures 24 and 25 respectively may be prepared by Hoffmann rearrangement of the amide 19. The intermediate isocyanate, 24 may be obtained by reducing the reaction time and working-up the reaction before completion.<br>
The isolation of starting materials AKBA and KBA for the semi-synthesis of the novel analogs is accomplished by the procedures known in the literatures (For example, US Patent Application # 2004073060). Preferred embodiments relating to the processes of preparing AKBA analogs mentioned in the foregoing discussion and other compounds of the subject invention are illustrated in the following examples, 1 to 27. These analogs inhibited 5-Lipoxigenase enzyme and also the growth of Brine Shrimp in cultures.<br><br><br><br>
