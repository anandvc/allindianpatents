"A PERFUMING COMPOSITION CONTAINING (6R)-4,5,6,7-TETRAHYDRO-3-6-DIMETHYL-3H-BENZO[b]FURAN-2-ONE"<br>
FIRMENICH SA, of 1, route des Jeunes, P.O. Box 239, 1211 Geneva 8, Switzerland,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery and the flavourings industry. More particularly,. it relates to the use of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dirnethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one of the formula<br><br>
as a flavouring or perfuming ingredient. The lactone of the formula (I) has excellent organoleptic properties, enabling it to be used to great advantage in perfumery and the flavourings industry.<br>
The present invention also relates to a new process for the preparation of the lactone of the formula (I).<br>
Prior art<br>
The chemical structure of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one is known. In fact, K. Schulte-Elte et al in Tetrahedron (1967), 23(6), 2583-2599 identified the compound of the formula (I) in a mixture of lactones resulting from the photooxidation of menthofuran. Furthermore, J. Hirsch et al in J. Org. Chem. (1967), 32(9), 2915-2916 also identified the lactone (I) from among other end products resulting   from   the   hydrolysis   of   a,a'-dimethoxydihydromenthofuran.<br><br><br>
However, these authors specify that the lactone (I) oxidises very easily under  the   synthesis  conditions   described   to  give   a  hydroxylactone, , 5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-7a-hydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-4H-benzo[b]furan-2-one   of the formula<br><br>
Moreover, some authors such as R. Woodward et al in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1950), 72, 399-403, who have studied the oxidation of menthofuran by employing greatly varying experimental conditions, have never identified the lactone (I), but have obtained the hydroxylactone (II) as the only oxidation product.<br>
So, although (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b] furan-2-one has been detected among other reaction products during the course of studies into the reactivity of menthofuran, no document of the prior art describes optimum synthesis enabling the lactone (I) to be obtained without it oxidising rapidly to form the hydroxylactone (II). In addition, these references give no indication or even a suggestion of the possible use of the lactone (I) as a perfuming or flavouring ingredient.<br>
Moreover, it is important to point out that certain documents of the prior art,<br>
which have analysed the constituents of natural products such as the essential<br>
oil Pycnanthemum floridanum (C. Shu et al , J. Ess. Oil Res. (1994), 6 (5), 529-<br>
531) or wild species of peppermint (Nakayama T; Higashiyama T.; Sakata 1.;<br>
Hashizume-t., Koryo, (1970), 57, 47-56), have identified a product that they refer<br>
to as "menthofurolactone", without specifying its structure. It seems that there is<br>
some confusion in the literature with respect to the structure associated with this<br>
name: while Chemical Abstracts uses menthofurolactone to refer to the structure<br>
(6R)-				<br><br>
4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one, i.e. the lactone (I), documents of the prior art use this name to designate 5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-7a-hydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-4H-benzo[b]furan-2-one of the formula (II).<br>
For example, Ito et al in Kitami Kogyo Tanki Daigaku, Kenkyu Hokoku (1969), 2(4), 585-587, who describe "the isolation of menthofurolactone from Mentha arvensis", associate the structure (II) with the name "menthofuro-lactone" and also describe its synthesis by the oxidation of menthofuran. Without doubt, the confusion arises from the fact that, as mentioned hereinabove, both the lactone (I) and the hydroxylactone (II) are products of the oxidation of menthofuran and, according to the prior art, the lactone (I) oxidises very easily to form the hydroxylactone (II). Consequently, the documents of the prior art by C. Shu et al and K. Umemoto, which refer to menthofurolactone as a constituent of a natural product without describing its structure and which date from later than the document by Ito et al referred to hereinabove, do not make it possible to establish what the structure of the lactone detected and named "menthofurolactone" was. On the basis of the experimental conditions employed in the prior art, the compound detected in the natural products is in fact the hydroxylactone of the formula (II). However, we have discovered quite surprisingly that the lactone of the formula (I) is present in the concrete of peppermint in trace form, although this constituent is very difficult to detect. In particular, we were able to ascertain that only certain experimental conditions, with respect to the choice of GC capillary column, allow the detection of the product by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, GCMS. For example, during GCMS analysis carried out using a polar column of the type used in the documents of the prior art which disclose analyses of natural products, the lactone (I) is not detected. In contrast, the same GCMS analysis carried out over an apolar column enabled us to observe the presence of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-<br><br><br>
one. It is clearly apparent from this comparison that the two documents referred to hereinabove are using the name "menthofuro-lactone" to designate the hydroxylactone (II).<br>
Therefore, although of known structure, no document of the prior art describes an optimum synthesis of the lactone (I) which would prevent its rapid oxidation into hydroxylactone (II). Moreover, it seems that this lactone has never been identified as a constituent of a natural product. Finally, there is no mention or suggestion in the prior art of the use of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one as a perfuming or flavouring ingredient.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now discovered quite surprisingly that the lactone of the formula (I) has excellent organoleptic properties, enabling it to be used to great advantage in perfumery and the flavourings industry.<br>
Thus the present invention relates to the use of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one as a perfuming or flavouring ingredient.<br>
(6R)-4,5,6,7-Tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one has a minty, slightly vanilla-scented odour, the flavour of which imparts sweetness and roundness to the compositions to which it is added and produces very pronounced and typical organoleptic effects when the said compound is incorporated into a perfume or flavour, even when greatly diluted.<br>
More particularly, the lactone (I) develops a phenolic/coumarin-like odour, making it a useful alternative to coumarin. (6R)-4,5,6,7-Tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one also has a completely original, minty odoriferous note much appreciated by perfumers. In fact, this combination of odoriferous features allows different olfactory nuances to be imparted which, in principle, one would only have been<br><br>
able to obtain with the contribution of a plurality of compounds, the combination of which would, however, produce unavoidably different olfactory effects.<br>
Furthermore, the odour of the compound according to the invention is advantageously powerful.<br>
The lactone of the formula (I) lends itself just as well to use in fine perfumery, in perfumes, eaux de toilette or aftershaves, as to other uses common in perfumery, such as the perfuming of soaps, shower or bath gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos and conditioners, as well as deodorants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations.<br>
(6R)-4,5,6,7-Tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one can also be used in applications such as liquid or solid detergents for the treatment of textiles, in fabric softeners and also in detergent compositions or cleaning products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces in domestic and industrial environments.<br>
In these applications, the compound according to the invention can be used alone or mixed with other perfuming ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in perfumery. The nature and variety of these co-ingredients do not require further description here, which in any case could not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of his general knowledge and according to the nature of the product to be perfumed and the desired olfactory effect. These perfuming co-ingredients can belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons and nitrogenous or sulfurous heterocyclic compounds, and also essential oils of natural or synthetic origin. A lot of these ingredients are listed in reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, and in other works of a similar nature.<br><br><br>
The proportions in which the compound according to the invention can be incorporated into the various aforementioned products vary within a very wide range of values. These values depend on the nature of the article or product that one wishes to perfume and on the desired olfactory effect, as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given composition when the compound according to the invention is mixed with perfuming o-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
As an example, typical concentrations are in the order of 1% to 10% by weight, even 20% by weight of the compound according to the invention, based on the weight of perfuming composition into which it is ncorporated. Lower concentrations can be used when this compound is applied directly in the perfuming of the various consumables mentioned lereinabove.<br>
The compound according to the invention has also proved highly useful in the field of flavourings.<br>
Its taste is typically associated with the characteristic flavours of vanilla or chocolate. The lactone according to the invention imparts a sweetness and a roundness, much appreciated by flavourists, to the compositions to which it is added.<br>
Owing to its characteristics, (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-8H-benzo[b]furan-2-one lends itself particularly well to applications in :he field of flavourings where a sugary taste is desired, for example in iesserts, sweets and other items of confectionery, compotes, yoghurts and other dairy products, chewing gums and jams. The lactone (I) also ends itself to use in drinks, ice-cream products, cigarettes, chewing cobacco, pharmaceutical preparations and dental care products.<br>
In these applications, the compound according to the invention is typically used in concentrations in the order of 1 ppb to 100 ppm, preferably 10 ppb to 20 ppm, relative to the foodstuffs into which it is ncorporated. Higher concentrations can be used when the compound<br><br>
according to the invention is used in the concentrated flavours or flavouring compositions to be incorporated into the consumables.<br>
The invention also relates to a new process for the preparation of<br>
(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one.	As<br>
mentioned hereinabove, the prior art does not provide an optimum solution to the problem of the synthesis of the lactone (I), which is likely to oxidise into the corresponding hydroxylactone when prepared under the conditions described in the prior art. The present invention provides a solution to the stated problem and thus relates to a process for the preparation of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one, characterised in that en2ymatic oxidation of menthofuran is carried out. In particular, the use of a lipase of the Novozym 435 type, under reaction conditions to be described in greater detail in Example 1 hereinbelow, enables the lactone (I) to be obtained during an oxidation reaction carried out in a controlled manner so as to limit the formation of the hydroxylactone (II).<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following examples, in which the temperatures are given in degrees Celsius and the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
Methods of carrying out the invention<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethvl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one<br>
150 g (1 mole) of (R)-(+)-menthofuran (synthetic origin: Toyotama Perf., [a]D2o = 84.1°; or natural origin: Todd [α]D20 = 88.1°), 144 g (1 mole) of octanoic acid and 7 g (11,500 U/g, 80,500 units) of immobilised lipase Novozym 435 were diluted in 150 ml of toluene. 142 ml (1.46 moles) of<br><br>
hydrogen peroxide at 35% were then added dropwise to the reaction<br>
mixture at 45° over a period of 15 mins. An exothermic reaction was<br>
observed. The reaction mixture was then held at ambient temperature for<br>
8 h. After filtration, 600 ml of diethylether were added, then the organic<br>
phase was washed successively with Na2CO3 at 5%, brine, water and<br>
brine again. 148.3 g of a yellow oil were obtained. After distillation under<br>
vacuum over 1 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), 37.2 g of<br>
(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzo[b]furan-2-one	were<br>
obtained in the form of a mixture of 2 diastereoisomers in a ratio of approximately 1:1, pure to 95% starting from synthetic menthofuran and pure to 85% starting from natural menthofuran, with a yield of 22%.<br>
