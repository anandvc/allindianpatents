				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates generally to compressors and refers more<br>
particularly to a protective coating that reduces corrosion for a compressor.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art:<br>
The outer shell of most compressors is composed of either a low<br>
carbon hot or cold rolled steel stamping or gray cast iron. The steel or cast<br>
iron, without a corrosion protectant coating, would typically corrode at a fast<br>
rate even in a non-marine environment. For conventional compressor<br>
applications, the outer surface of the compressor body is painted to minimize<br>
corrosion. Corrosion mitigation is important not only to extend the useable life<br>
of the compressor, but also to prevent premature failure of the pressurized<br>
shell which may result in personal injury.<br>
The steel compressor"s outer surface is composed of several stamped<br>
steel components that are assembled together primarily by welding. Welding,<br>
in itself, causes the surface of the steel be even more prone to corrosion due<br>
to several metallurgical factors, two of which are hindering paint adhesion and<br>
forming pinholes. The cast iron compressor version is composed of several<br>
iron castings assembled together by fasteners. In the case of gray cast iron,<br>
corrosion is also prone mainly because of the intrinsic presence of graphite<br>
within the cast iron. Graphite encourages corrosion because of the galvanic<br>
difference between iron and graphite, which causes preferential corrosion of<br><br>
the iron matrix. Therefore, it is obvious to any expert in the corrosion field<br>
that the aforementioned compressor types are highly likely to corrode,<br>
especially in extreme environments.<br>
The painting process mentioned as the prior art, has the following<br>
sequence of events associated with it"s application: Liquid chemical cleaning of<br>
the steel or iron surface to remove organic and inorganic contamination,<br>
phosphatizing the cleaned surface (creating an iron phosphate layer that aids in<br>
the adhesion of the paint), sealing the phosphated coating (sealing controls the<br>
phosphating reaction and prepares the surface for painting), painting the<br>
compressor (either with a powder electrostatic spraying, dipping or liquid<br>
spraying methods), curing the paint either at room temperature or at elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
Typically, the painted compressor must pass several standard test<br>
methods to be considered acceptable. ASTMB-117 is one such standard test<br>
method. With the paint quality associated with the prior art, it is conceivable<br>
that the compressor would pass the standard test methods and still have<br>
signs of corrosion of the underlying steel or iron (red rust) visible at localized<br>
regions on the painted surface. For most applications, this sporadic red rust<br>
is normal and would not affect the functionality of the compressor for the life<br>
of the compressor.<br>
However, certain compressor applications require very high reliability<br>
and can not succumb to a corrosion failure without great loss. These stringent<br>
applications require no visible red rust corrosion on the surface for an<br>
extended period of time (as mentioned: despite the fact that it passed ASTM<br><br>
testing). An example of such an application would be climate controlled<br>
marine containers that are transported across the ocean. Marine<br>
environments are especially corrosion causing because of the presence of<br>
salts and other corrosion enhancing constituents found in seawater. The<br>
"containers" may be exposed to marine mist or even periodically come in<br>
contact with seawater due to splashing. Temperature fluctuations and direct<br>
sun light may also be present (which includes the deleterious effect of<br>
ultraviolet rays). These containers need to be refrigerated uninterrupted for<br>
the entire journey to protect the enclosed cargo. These are high reliability<br>
requiring applications, where failure of the compressor would not be easily<br>
repairable and would result in large monetary damages if the climate control<br>
system ceased to function. This represents an extraordinary challenge<br>
considering the especially corrosion inducing marine environment.<br>
The painting procedure described as the prior art does not have a high<br>
enough corrosion preventative property associated with it. The prior art,<br>
although acceptable for most applications, does not fulfill the requirements of<br>
preventing "no visible red rust" during the life of the compressor. The prior art<br>
has a weakness in that when nicks or dings occur due to, for example,<br>
accidental impact or scratching damage during compressor handling or<br>
preventative maintenance, the paint cracks and exposes bare steel which<br>
then corrodes at an accelerated rate. The prior art paint process serves only<br>
to provide a weak barrier coating. Once this coating is penetrated to the<br>
underlying steel, corrosion immediately occurs. Bare metal exposed in this<br>
manner will corrode quickly because there is no strong "cathodic protection"<br><br>
provided by the prior art"s paint. This is a weakness of the prior art especially<br>
because of the long hours the compressors are exposed to corrosive<br>
environments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a<br>
compressor system is provided which is coated with an environmental<br>
protective coating. The coating is comprised of two or three layers, the first <br>
being a sprayed porous metallic layer disposed on the compressor. The <br>
second layer being a organic based surface layer disposed on the sprayed<br>
metallic layer for sealing the metallic layer pores and the optional third layer <br>
being an organic based topcoat finish used for cosmetic reasons as well as to <br>
further enhance corrosion resistance.<br>
The sprayed metallic layer is formed by powder flame spraying, wire flame<br>
spraying, or electric arc spraying. The metallic layer thickness should be between 0.010<br>
to 0.015 inches. The sprayed metallic layer should have a tensile bond adhesion level<br>
of at least 1,000 psi.<br>
Also disclosed is a method of having the steps of treating the surface<br>
of the compressor with an abrasive grit to a suitable finish. After the surface<br>
of the compressor is treated, a metallic coating is thermally sprayed onto the<br>
treated surface of the compressor. A organic-based sealer and an optional<br>
top coat finish are then applied to the metallic coating to seal the pores within<br>
the thermally sprayed layer.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
Still other advantages of the present invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art after reading the following specification and by<br>
reference to the drawings in which: Figures 1-3 show parts of the compressor<br>
main body in various stages of the processing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figures 1-3 show the parts of the compressor main body 10 in the<br>
various stages of processing. As can be seen, the spray head 11 from the<br>
thermal sprayer apparatus is shown applying the metallic coating layer 12<br>
onto the surface of the compressor.<br>
The coating system of the present invention provides a strong "barrier"<br>
property because of the sprayed metallic layer 12. The form and composition<br>
of the sprayed metallic layer 12 described herein is ductile and very adherent<br>
to the underlying steel. Therefore, if accidental impact occurs, such as with a<br>
wrench, the aluminum will just dent and smear and still remain basically in<br>
tact and still cover or protect the steel. The sprayed metallic layer 12, of<br>
course, must be thick enough to supply this property.<br>
Moreover, the electrochemical galvanic potential relationship between<br>
the sprayed metallic layer 12 and steel are such that the steel or iron<br>
compressor housing 10 becomes protected even when bare steel or iron<br>
regions are locally exposed to the corrodant. The sprayed metallic, which is<br>
preferably an aluminum coating, is sacrificial to the steel and therefore<br>
protects the steel from corroding. The approximate relationship describing<br><br>
this is as follows: Service Life in Years=(0.64 x Aluminum Coating Thickness<br>
(micrometers))/Percent Surface Area As Bare Steel.<br>
The first step in the present invention is to clean the outer surfaces of<br>
the compressor body 10 to be coated of all grease, oil or other organic<br>
contamination. An aqueous alkaline cleaning system will suffice. In the case of<br>
gray cast iron an additional step may be needed depending upon condition of<br>
the cast iron surface. Graphite present on the surface of the cast iron may<br>
inhibit adhesion of the metallic coating. A special chemical treatment may be<br>
necessary to remove some or most of the exposed surface graphite. One such<br>
method is known in the industry as Kolene Electrolytic Salt process. It is<br>
understood that there may be other methods that are more economical in the<br>
industry that will serve the same purpose. In certain cases, this graphite<br>
removal step may not be necessary depending upon the quality of the casting<br>
surface and the effectiveness of the grit blasting.<br>
It is preferable that the compressor"s outer surface is first thoroughly<br>
treated by abrasive grit blasting. The blasting must be sufficient enough to<br>
satisfy the surface finish requirements of SSPC SP 5 or NACE #1 "White<br>
Metal". Proper surface preparation by blasting is critical to produce a well<br>
adhering thermally sprayed metallic coating. This roughened surface texture<br>
not only removes surface contamination by exposing fresh steel or iron, but<br>
also serves to mechanically anchor the aluminum coating firmly to the<br>
substrate. Angular hard steel grit of mesh size of about 25-40 can be used, but<br>
the preferred grit media is aluminum oxide with a mesh size of about 16-30. It<br>
is preferred that the indentation that the shot makes on the surface of the steel<br><br>
ambient air temperature shall be about 5 degrees Fahrenheit minimum above<br>
the dew point.<br>
As shown in Figures 1-3, the incident angle of the metallic spray should<br>
be as close to 90 degrees as possible. The angle should not be less than 45<br>
degrees. It has been shown that coating porosity increases as the incident<br>
angle is reduced below 90 degrees. Distance of the spray gun to compressor<br>
body 10 shall not farther than 8 inches for similar reasoning.<br>
The most preferred composition is pure aluminum (99.9 % minimum purity). The<br>
metal system deposited on the steel may be an aluminum alloy, having less than about<br>
10% magnesium. An alloyed aluminum metal system preferably has less than about 5%<br>
magnesium, which has good corrosion resistance. Aluminum/Zinc alloys should be<br>
avoided in marine corrosion conditions, because they have less corrosion resistance<br>
because of its solubility in salt water. The thickness of the aluminum shall be such that<br>
there is no interconnected porosity from the atmosphere to the base steel or iron<br>
substrate. This condition helps to prevent corrosion of the substrate. To help avoid this<br>
porosity problem, the thickness of aluminum must be about .010 to .015 inch in thickness.<br>
The aluminum coating thickness should be measured with an eddy current, ultrasonic or<br>
magnetic induction type instruments. The tensile bond adhesion strength of the<br>
aluminized coating must be 1000 PSI minimum as checked with the Elcometer Model 106<br>
adhesion tester in accordance with ASTM D 4514. The wire diameter of the aluminum<br>
shall be about .0625 inch. The nozzle gas pressure during aluminizing shall be about 55<br>
PSI.<br><br>
The metallic coating can be Powder Flame Sprayed or Wire Flame<br>
Sprayed, but the preferred method is by Electric Arc Wire Spraying. Electric<br>
Arc Wire Spraying exhibits a higher quality coating and is more economical<br>
than flame spraying for this application. Electric Wire Arc Spraying is<br>
performed by contacting two aluminum wires which are at a potential to each<br>
other and generating a melt inducing arc. This arc is in proximity to a forced<br>
gas or air jet. The gas may be an inert gas, but for economic reasons, dry and<br>
cleaned compressed air may be used.<br>
The aluminum wire becomes molten in the vicinity of the arc and the gas<br>
jet atomizes the aluminum and forces the droplets to impinge upon the steel or<br>
iron substrate. The droplets of aluminum impinge upon the steel and build up<br>
layer-by-layer until the desired thickness is achieved. The droplets start to cool<br>
and partially solidify prior to impingement. The kinetic energy of the droplets<br>
cause deformation and flattening of the aluminum particles as they hit the steel<br>
forming a uniform layer of aluminum on the steel or iron surfaces. Because of<br>
the nature of this deposition process, a small amount of porosity forms between<br>
the particles of aluminum. To maximize corrosion resistance, interconnected<br>
porosity (porosity that connects the marine atmosphere with the underlying<br>
ferrous substrate), must not exist. To prevent this, a sufficient amount of<br>
aluminum must be deposited and an adequate sealer must be employed to<br>
block the pores. The coating must be applied in multiple, thin even coatings<br>
and not heavily applied in one spray. It has been found advantageous, for<br>
completeness of coating, to perform spray strokes at 90 degrees from each<br>
other and to allow some overlap for each subsequent spray stroke. The<br><br>
practical application of this process dictates that it be automated and applied by<br>
a robot or similar technology. This will assure consistency and completeness of<br>
the coating. The grit blasting, described above, shall also be automated for the<br>
same reasons. The complex shape of a compressor makes it difficult to<br>
consistently coat or blast manually. Automation assures that all areas of the<br>
compressor are adequately treated.<br>
After thermal spraying the compressor, a seal coating is applied. The<br>
purpose of a sealing step is to fill any porosity present in the thermally sprayed<br>
metal coating and to further enhance corrosion resistance. If a sealer is used<br>
without a top coat finish, it shall exhibit ultraviolet radiation stability from<br>
exposure to the sun. This step enhances the corrosion resistance of the<br>
metallized coating and increases the useable life of the aluminized compressor.<br>
When only a sealer is used, the sealer also serves to produce a cosmetically<br>
acceptable aluminized compressor. The aluminized compressor must not<br>
exhibit dark blotches, which occur if improperly sealed or if an inadequate<br>
sealer is used.<br>
Several properties of the sealer must be unique to this compressor<br>
application. Therefore a special custom formulated sealer has been invented.<br>
The viscosity of the seal must be low enough so that the coating wicks into the<br>
pores and does not agglomerate on the surface. The thickness of the seal coat<br>
should not be greater than about .002 inch dry film thickness over the top of the<br>
aluminized coating. No moisture should be present on the surface of the<br>
metallized compressor prior to sealing unless the sealer is a water-based type.<br>
If moisture is present, the compressor shall be heated to 250° F to remove<br><br>
moisture prior to the application of the sealant. Application of the seal coat<br>
should take place within about 24 hours of metallizing for optimal results.<br>
Ultraviolet protection properties should also be incorporated into the seal coat if<br>
no topcoat is used.<br>
In addition, the chosen seal coat type must be such that it will withstand<br>
a constant compressor operating temperature of 300° F. Only certain regions<br>
of the compressor"s surface may reach this magnitude of temperature,<br>
therefore the sealer must not discolor in the heated region and remain<br>
uncolored in the non-heated region so as to produce a two-tone appearance.<br>
After long term exposure to 300 F, the sealant must not degrade it"s corrosion<br>
preventing sealing properties. Moreover, the sealer must retain it"s all of the<br>
stated properties after exposure to normal compressor oils such as; polyol<br>
ester, mineral oils, etc.. Accidental spillage of these oils may occur that exposes<br>
the aluminized and sealed surface to such oils.<br>
The application of the sealant may be by brushing, spraying or dipping<br>
into the sealant. For the same reasons as above, the sealer shall be applied in<br>
a consistent manner that preferably utilizes automation. The curing process for<br>
the sealant should not exceed 300 F as to not damage the internal components<br>
of the compressor due to excessive thermal degradation. The sealant should<br>
coat the compressor uniformly without agglomeration, which exceeds the<br>
required sealer thickness.<br>
There are several chemical families that will meet the aforementioned<br>
requirements. Generally, the customized sealant described herein will have a carrier, an<br>
organic component, and an inorganic component. The first sealer consists of a silicon<br><br>
resin acrylic sealant containing: parachlorobenzotriflouride, phenyl propyl silicone, mineral<br>
spirits, high solids silicone, acrylic resin and cobalt compounds. Additionally, particulates<br>
such as aluminum and/or silica can be incorporated. The silicon resin coating has good<br>
U.V. stability and is stable at 300°F. Applying two coats of about .001 inch dry film<br>
thickness each has been found to achieve better results than one coat at about .002 inch<br>
thickness.<br>
Another possible sealant coating is an epoxy polyamide with n-butyl<br>
alcohol, C8.C10 aromatic hydrocarbons, zinc phosphate compounds and<br>
amorphous silica.<br>
The final coating considered acceptable for this application is a cross-<br>
linked epoxy phenolic with an alkaline curing agent. The adherence and<br>
performance of this sealant shall be enhanced by first applying an aluminum<br>
conversion coating on top of the thermally sprayed aluminum. Two such<br>
conversion coatings known in the industry are Alodine or Iridite. The epoxy<br>
phenolic is then applied over the conversion coating.<br>
Top coat finishes shall be of higher viscosity and similar in nature to<br>
paints. The maximum topcoat thickness shall be about .004 inch. The topcoat<br>
is applied over the sealer. The topcoat shall not be too thick as to negate the<br>
cathodic protective properties of the underlying thermally sprayed coating. For<br>
cosmetic reasons, it is preferable that dark coloring agents such as carbon<br>
black be added to the sealant or top coat to achieve a black or gray color.<br>
Moreover, the topcoat must be compatible with the sealer to maintain good<br><br>
adhesion. Top coat finishes should not be applied over an un-sealed<br>
aluminized coating.<br>
The following are topcoat finishes that comply with the cosmetic and<br>
functional requirements setforth herein: The first topcoat finish is a polyurethane<br>
polymer with curing agents containing ethyl acetate, hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate, homopolymer of HDI, n-butyl acetate and fine aluminum particles.<br>
This sealant also complies with the requirements of this application. The color<br>
of this top coat is gray-black.<br>
Yet another top coat coating is a neutral urethane base acrylic with ethyl benzene,<br>
methyl ketone, xylene, aromatic naphtha, barium sulfate, and 1,2,4 trimethyl benzene and<br>
a polyisocyanate curing agent. The color of this product is black. The final top coat finish<br>
considered is an epoxy polyamide which contains magnesium silicate, titanium dioxide,<br>
black iron oxide, butyl alcohol and naptha. The color of this product is haze gray.<br>
A wide variety of features can be utilized in the various materials<br>
disclosed and described above. The foregoing discussion discloses and<br>
describes a preferred embodiment of the present invention. One skilled in the<br>
art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying<br>
drawings that various changes, modifications, and variations can be made<br>
therein without departing from the true spirit and fair scope of the invention.<br><br>
