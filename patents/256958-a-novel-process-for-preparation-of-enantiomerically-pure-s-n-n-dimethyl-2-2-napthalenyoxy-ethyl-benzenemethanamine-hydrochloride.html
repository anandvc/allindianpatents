TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"A NOVEL PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF ENANTIOMERICALLY PURE S-(+)-N,N-DIMETHYL-2-[2-(NAPTHALENYOXY)-ETHYL]BENZENEMETHANAMINE<br>
HYDROCHLORIDE'<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad-380015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification describes the invention:<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing dapoxetine, in particular a process for preparing (+)-dapoxetine in enantiomerically pure form from the racemate of dapoxetine of formula (II) and thereby its resolution with (+)-di-p-toluyl tartaric acid followed by treatment with HC1 to obtain S(+)-dapoxetine hydrochloride i.e. S(+)-N,N-dimethyl-2-[2-(naphthalenyloxy)ethyl]benzene- methanamine hydrochoride of formula (I).<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Premature ejaculation is the most common form of ejaculatory dysfunction, affecting upto 39% of the general male population. Behaviour therapy is an effective treatment in the majority of cases. However, pharmacotherapy is required in those cases of lifelong premature ejaculation. Tricyclic antidepressants and clomipramine are the most extensively studied agents for this indication, in addition to a-adrenoceptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and gabapentin. The most advanced agent under clinical development for premature ejaculation is the potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dapoxetine, a compound structurally related to the antidepressant floxetine (Prozac) is enantiomerically pure and one of the important drug as an serotonin reuptake inhibitor.<br>
Flouxetine (III), Tomoxetine (IV), Nisoxetine (V) and Duloxetine (VI) belong to the group of non-tricyclic antidepressants which act by inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonine (B. B. Molly et. al, USP 4018895, 19 April, 1977). A Chemoenzymatic synthesis of Duloxetine (VI) has been reported (H. L. Liu et. al, Chirality, 12, 26, 2000). Flouxetine hydrochloride is sold as the racemate (Prozac, Eli Lilly Co.), but recently interest has been shown for marketing the more active (R)-enantiomer as a so-called "Improved Chemical Entity" version of the drug. Tomoxetine (IV) was the first norepinephrine reuptake inhibiting antidepressant to be reported, and the (R)-enantiomer is nine times more potent than the (5)-enantiomer (A. Kumar et. al, Tetrahedron Lett., 32, 1901, 1991). This drugs are the derivatives of 3-methylamino-l-phneylpropan-l-ol which contians a stereocenter, and<br>
2<br><br>
retro synthetic analysis reveals that enantiopure (R)-3-chloro-l-phenylpropan-l-ol should be a suitable chiral building block.<br><br>
Technical reports vol. 6 (14) of Albany Molecular Research Inc. discloses development of novel SNAr reactions for new routes to Atomoxetine or Tomoxetine (IV) and its derivatives. A series of 3-aryloxy-3-arylpropylamines have been developed in recent years as drug candidates. {Life Sciences, 1988, 43, 2049). Interestingly it is the substitution of the aryl rings on this pharmacophore that determine different activity in diverse receptor in vivo. (R)-Atomoxetine can be prepared by one of the proposed route in which the enantiopure benzylic alcohol moiety of (R)-Atomoxetine was activated and displaced by a phenol to generate an ether with an inverted stereochemistry.<br>
During the past decade, the relationship between monoamine uptake and a variety of<br>
diseases and conditions has been appreciated and investigated. For example, the<br>
hydrochloride	salt	of	Fluoxetine	(dl-N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[4-<br>
(triflouromethyl)phenoxy]propanamine) is a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) uptake inhibitor which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of depression and is also presently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of eating disorders,  alcoholism,  and other disorders.  Similarly, Tomoxetine<br>
3<br><br>
hydrochloride (-)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-(2-methyl-phenoxy)hydrochloride) is a selective inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake that is being investigated clinically for its antidepressant activity.<br>
These compounds are among taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4018895, 4194009, 4314081 as being potent blockers of the uptake of various physiologically active monoamines including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. U.S Pat. No. 4207343 discloses 1-phenyl-3(substituted phenoxy)propanamines as having the ability to block the uptake of a variety of monoamines.<br>
EP 0288188 Bl also discloses the use of dibenzoyl-d-and-1-tartaric acid to obtain enantiomerically pure S-(+)- N,N-Dimethyl-l-phenyl-3-(l-napthalenyloxy)-propanamine i.e. Dapoxetine and its hydrochloride salt thereafter by treatment with inorganic acid hydrochloric acid.<br>
The Patent US 5023269 and US 4956388 mentions about 3-aryl oxy-3-substituted propanamines capable of inhibiting the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and methods of preparing them.<br>
Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 5135947 discloses l-phenyl-3-napthalenyloxypropanamines and their use as selective serotonin receptive inhibitors. It further discloses to convert free amines to their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by treating with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, oxalic, para-bromophenylsulfonic, carbonic, succinic, citric, benzoic and acetic acid, and related inorganic and organic acid. This patent further discloses the resolution of racemate base of dapoxetine with (+)-tartaric acid to obtain S(+)-N,N-Dimethyl-l-phenyl-3-(l-napthalenyl oxy)-propanamine (+) - tartrate in very poor yield. Also resolution was carried out using (+) - 3-bromocamphor-8-sulfonic acid to obtain S (+)-dapoxtine in a very poor yield.<br>
There is, therefore, a need for an improved process for the preparation of (+)-dapoxetine which alleviates the problems associated with prior art processes as referred above. We have developed such a process which is advantageous to yield an enantiomerically pure form of (+)-dapoxetine. In Particular, our process can be seen to achieve the above described advantage, by carrying out resolution as a final step in the reaction process (thereby obviating the opportunity for racemization during preceding intermediate process steps) and or avoiding conditions that would result in the production of intermediates products that would be prone to racemization.<br>

According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a process for preparing (+)-dapoxetine, or an acid addition salt thereof, which process comprises: <br>
(i)        resolving racemic (±)-dapoxetine with a chiral acid so as to obtain a salt of the chiral<br>
acid and (+)-dapoxetine, substantially free from (-)-dapoxetine. <br>
(ii)      converting (+)-dapoxetine prepared in step (i) to the free base or another acid addition<br>
salt thereof.<br>
The resolution step (i) is achieved with a suitable chiral acid in a suitable solvent. The chiral acid can typically be selected from the group consisting of mandelic acid, tartaric acid, di-p-toluyl tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, camphor sulfonic acid and the like. Other suitable chiral acids may be determined by testing and the use thereof in a process as described above falls within the scope of the present invention. Preferably the chiral acid employed in a process according to the present invention is (+)-di-p-toluyl tartaric acid. Suitably, the solvent employed is a aliphatic halogenated lower alkanes, cyclic or acyclic alkanes, lower alcohols, ketones etc, although again the other suitable solvents can be determined by testing and the use thereof in a process as described above falls within the scope of the present invention. A preferred solvent is methylene dichloride.<br>

Such salts of chiral acid and (+)-dapoxetine, substantially free of (-)-dapoxetine, are useful as intermediates for preparing the free base or another acid addition salt as appropriate.<br>
Suitable salts provided by the present invention include (+)-dapoxetine mandelate, (+)-dapoxetine tartarate, (+)-dapoxetine di-p-toluyl tartarate, (+)-dibenzoyl tartarate, (+)-dapoxetine camphor sulfonate and the like. A preferred salt according to the present invention is (+)-dapoxetine di-p-toluyl tartarate, which is useful as an intermediate for preparing the free base or another acid addition salt as appropriate.<br>
Intermediate salts prepared according to the present invention as described above can be converted to the free base or another acid addition salt according to the step (ii) of a process according to the present invention. Suitably, an intermediate salt of the chiral acid and (+)-dapoxetine can be treated with a base, such as sodium hydroxide, to yield the free base. The free base itself can, if desired, be converted into an acid addition salt therof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts which may be formed in step (ii) include those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acids and are well known to those of skill in the art. Acids commonly employed to form such salts include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids<br>

In an inert N2 environment, 4.3 L of methylene dichloride is taken into 20 L round bottom flask. 1.160 kg of AICI3 was added into the reaction flask at 25° to 35°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C to 5°C. 1 kg of 3-chloropropionyl chloride is added into the reaction mixture at 0°C to 10°C during 1-2 hours followed by stirring for 30 minutes at the same temperature. 0.7 kg of benzene and 0.7 L of methylene dichloride mixture is added during 1-2 hours at 0°C to 10°C. The reaction mass is stirred for 1 hour at same temperature. The temperature is raised to 10°C to 20°C and is allowed to stir for 2 hours at the same temperature. The reaction mixture is added into the mixture of 6.0 kg of ice and 0.75 L of Cone. HCl at 0°C to 5°C and stirred for 30 minutes at 5°C to 10°C. The organic layer of methylene dichloride is separated at 25°C to 35°C. The aqueous layer is extracted with 1 L if methylene dichloride at 25°C to 35°C and the methylene dichloride layer is separated at the same temperature. The combined organic layer is washed with water followed by separation of methylene dichloride layer at 25°C to 35°C. The separated organic layer is washed 10% NaHCO3 solution. After the separation of layers the emulsion part is passed through hyflosupercel bed followed by washing with methylene dichloride. The filtrate consisting of methylene dichloride is washed with water followed by removal of methylene dichloride by distillation and vacuum. The product thus obtained is treated with hexane. The solvent hexane is then distilled off under vacuum to give compound (a). <br>

The solution of 250 g of Dapoxetine Base is prepared in a 250 mL of methylene dichloride and was allowed to stirred for 15 to 20 minutes at 25° to 35°C. 316.6 g of p-ditoluyl D-(+)-tartaric acid (DTTA) is added into the reaction mixture at 25° to 35°C. 175 mL of methylene dichloride is further added into the reaction mixture at 25° to 35°C and was allowed to stir for 30 minutes at same temperature. The solid product precipitates out. Further 825 mL of methylene dichloride is added into the reaction mixture at 25° to 35°C. The reaction mixture is filtered and the bed is washed with 2 x 250 mL of methylene dichloride. The material is dried in oven at 50° to 55°C to obtain the desired product i.e. (+)-Dapoxetine p-ditolyl tartaric acid salt [Compound (e)].<br>

Purification:<br>
The solution of 190 g of (+)-Dapoxetine p-ditolyl tartaric acid salt is prepared in 1560 mL of methylene dichloride at 25° to 35°C. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux temperature for 1 hour at 38° to 40°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C to 30°C. The reaction mixture is further stirred at 10°C to 15°C for 1 hour and is filtered at same temperature, washed with 2 x 195 mL of methylene dichloride. <br>
Final Purification:<br>
The solution of 165 g of (+)-Dapoxetine p-ditolyl tartaric acid salt is prepared in 330 mL of methylene dichloride at 25° to 35°C. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux temperature for 30 minutes at 35° to 40°C. 495 mL of ethyl acetate is added into the reaction mixture at the same temperature within 1-1.5 hours. After the addition is over the reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C to 30°C and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is further cooled at 10°C to 15°C and stirred for 1 hour and is filtered at same temperature, washed with 2 x 82.5 mL of methylene dichloride : Ethyl acetate (2:3) to obtain pure (+)-Dapoxetine p-ditolyl tartaric acid salt. <br>
Example-6: <br>
Preparation of (+)-Dapoxetine Base:<br>
The solution of 156.8 g of (+)-Dapoxetine p-ditolyl tartaric acid salt is prepared in 784 mL of methylene dichloride at 25°C to 35°C. 784 mL of water is added at the same temperature and the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes at 25°C to 35°C. The solution of 10% NaOH is prepared by adding 27.2 g of NaOH in 272 mL of water at 25°C to 35°C. Add 10% NaOH solution in the reaction mixture at same temperature within 1 hour. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour at same temperature and is allowed to settle for 30 minutes. The organic layer and aqueous layers are separated at 25°C to 35°C. The aqueous layer and 784 mL of methylene dichloride is taken in the reaction vessel and stirred for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is allowed to settle for 30 minutes. Both the methylene dichloride layers are combined. The organic layer of methylene dichloride and 784 mL of water are stirred for 30 minutes and allowed to settle. The layers are further separated. The methylene dichloride layer is passed through hyflosupercel bed and washed with 2 x 78 mL of methylene dichloride. The organic layer is distilled out under vacuum below 40°C to obtain compound (f). <br>
Chiral purity = 99.81 (+); 0.19 (-). <br>

Abstract<br>
This invention relates to a new process for preparation of enantiomerically pure dapoxetine or an acid addition salt thereof i.e. S(+)-N,N-dimethyl-2-[2-(naphthalenyl oxy)ethyl]benzenemethanamine hydrochoride, a potent serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which comprises resolving racemic (±)-dapoxetine i.e. (±)- N,N-dimethyl-2-[2-(naphthalenyloxy)ethyl] benzene methanamine with a chiral acid so as to obtain salt of the chiral acid and (+)-dapoxetine, substantially free from (-)-dapoxetine. Dapoxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor is structurally related to fluoxetine, atomoxetine, tomoxetine with ejaculatory dysfunction activity.<br>
