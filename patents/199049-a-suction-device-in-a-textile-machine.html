				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a suction device in a textile machine for discharging waste material, with a suction pipeline, a suction blower provided in the line and a filter element attached to the outlet of the line.<br>
Such suction devices in textile machines, in particular fibre-processing textile machines, are known. They are used, for example, in combing machines for discharging waste material in form of short fibres, trash particles and dust. The filter element, which is usually arranged as a cloth filter which is conically tapered towards an outlet, is provided with the task of holding back a larger part of the waste material, in particular fibres and trash particles, but allowing a larger part of the conveying air to pass. The retained waste material can then be discharged with the remainder of the conveying air through the outlet of the filter and transported to a collection container. The air passing through the filter usually contains fine residues of the waste material, in particular in form of dust. It is therefore not desirable to allow this air to exit directly into the ambient environment. A common possibility consists of supplying the air in a factory building to the air-conditioning unit which is allocated to a plurality of textile machines jointly and in which the discharged air from the suqtion devices, among others, is filtered and, optionally, washed prior to being emitted into the ambient environment. Such textile machine installations with a central air-conditioning system, however, are rather expensive.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide the suction device of the kind mentioned above in such a way that the discharged air can be freed in the suction device per se from the dust to such a substan-<br><br>
tial extend that thereafter the direct emission of the air into the ambient environment is unproblematic.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that a centrifugal separator is connected to a casing encompassing the discharged air side of the filter element, which separator is provided with a dust separator duct with a curved outer wall which deflects the discharged air and extends up to a outlet cross section of the duct, and that a part of the outlet cross section adjacent to the outer wall coincides with the inlet cross section of a return duct which opens out into a suction pipeline.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a suction device in a textile machine for discharging waste material, with a suction pipeline, a suction blower arranged in the line and a filter element connected to the outlet of the line, characterized in that a centrifugal separator is connected to a casing which encompasses the discharged air side of the filter element, which separator is provided with a dust separator duct with a curved outer wall which deflects the discharged air and extends up to an outlet cross section of the duct, and that a part of the outlet cross section adjacent to the outer wall coincides with the inlet cross section of a return duct which opens out into the suction pipeline.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are explained below by reference to the enclosed drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a part of a combing machine with a suction device and<br><br>
Figs. 2 and fig. 3 each shown in the same representation as in fig. 1 a modification of a part of the suction device.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a part of a combing machine with a number of combing heads. Each combing head carries a wound lap 1 from where a lap is wound off during the operation and is combed with combing tools (not shown). Short fibres and impurities are removed from the lap by the combing. This waste material is sucked into a suction duct 2 in each combing head. The suction ducts 2 open out into a common suction pipeline 3 in which a suction blower 4 is disposed. A cloth filter 5 is connected to the output of line 3 which tapers conically towards an outlet 6.<br><br>
The major part of the waste material supplied by suction pipeline 3 is retained in the filter 5, in particular short fibres and any trash particles, whereas the major part of the conveying air passes through filter 5.<br>
The retained waste material is discharged with the remainder of the conveying air, e.g. approx. 15 % of the air flowing through the line 3, through the outlet 6 of the filter 5 and a pipeline 7 connected to this outlet 6.<br>
The discharged air passing through the filter cloth of filter 5 contains a certain percentage rate of fine-particle waste material in the form of dust. That is why this discharged air should not be blown out directly into the ambient environment.<br>
For the removal of dust from the discharged air, the discharged air side of the conical filter 5 is encompassed in accordance with the invention by a casing 8 which opens out at the top into a centrifugal separator 9. The centrifugal separator 9 is provided with a dust separator duct 10 with a curved outer wall 11 which deflects the discharged air and with a inner guide wall<br>
12.	The curvature of the outer wall favourably extends over approx. 180°, as is represented. The dust separator duct 10 is closed at the side by the side walls which extend downwardly up to the upper side of a box<br>
13.	The inner guide wall 12 is arranged in such a way that the dust separator duct 10 narrows in the direction of the air flow. This leads to an increase in the flow speed of the air and thus also to an increase in the centrifugal force.<br>
The outer wall 11 and the inner wall 12 extend up to an outlet cross section 14 of the dust separator duct 10.<br>
r<br><br>
A part of the outlet cross section 14 which is adjacent to the outer wall 11 coincides with an inlet cross section 15 of the return duct 16 whose lower end on the suction side of the blower 4 opens out into the suction pipeline 3.<br>
When the discharged air flows through the dust separator duct 10 during the operation, dust particles in the discharged air are accumulated in the vicinity of the outer wall 11 as a result of the centrifugal force. A part of the discharged air which is adjacent to the outer wall 11 and is enriched with dust particles enters the return duct 16 through the inlet cross section 15 and is sucked into the suction pipeline 3 again. This part of the discharged air is again pressed through the filter 5 and the centrifugal separator 9. The remainder of the discharged air, in which the dust concentration is reduced by the centrifugal effect, exits from the outlet cross section 14 of the dust separator duct 10 next to the inlet cross section 15.<br>
The box 13, which preferably stands on floor 17, is arranged below the outlet cross section 14. It receives the remainder of the discharged air with the reduced dust concentration. The box 13 comprises in its lower part outlet openings 18 for the discharge of the discharged air near the floor, so that the dust particles remaining in the discharged air can settle effortless on the floor and do not easily reach up to the height of the head of the operator. Box 13 also comprises filter 5 with its casing 8 and the return duct 16.<br>
The size of the inlet cross section 15 of the return duct 16 can favourably be equal to 10 to 50 % and preferably approx. equal to 30 % of the size of the outlet cross section 14 of the dust separator duct 10.<br><br>
±n the described suction device it is achieved with simple means to considerably reduce the dust content of the discharged air exiting into the ambient environment. If the dust concentration of the air coming from the combing heads of the combing machine has a value K in the suction pipeline 3 (prior to the entrance of the return duct 16) , then the dust concentration in the discharged air entering into box 13 from the outlet cross section 14 of the dust separator duct 10 is only approx. 20 to 40 % of K.<br>
Fig, 2 shows a modification with a dust separator duct 10.1 in which the curved inner guide wall 12 of fig. 1 is replaced by a shorter inner guide wall 12.1 which extends in a straight line. This leads to a larger outlet cross section 14.1 of the dust separator duct 10.1 as compared with fig. 1. The other parts of the suction device of fig. 2 are the same as in fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another modification in which the dust separator duct 10 has the appearance at first as in fig. 1. A second guide wall 19 is arranged in addition below the inner guide wall 12 in such a way that the discharged air from the outlet cross section 14 of the dust separator duct 10 next to the inlet cross section 15 of the return duct 16 does not enter box 13, but into the space between the two guide walls 12 and 19. The discharged air is laterally guided away from this space through an opening 20 in one of the side walls of the dust separator duct 10 which reaches right up to the upper side of box 13.<br><br><br>
