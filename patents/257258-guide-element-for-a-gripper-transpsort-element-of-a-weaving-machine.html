Description<br>
Guide element for a gripper transport element of a weaving machine<br>
The invention relates to a guide element for a gripper transport element of<br>
a weaving machine with guides that form a form-closed frame that is open<br>
on one side for the gripper transport element.<br>
Gripper transport elements consist of gripper rods or gripper bands that are<br>
introduced into a weaving shed from one side of the weaving machine. A<br>
gripper transport element moves a gripper, that has taken up a weft thread,<br>
either to the opposite side of the weaving shed, where the weft thread is<br>
taken over by a takeover element. Or the gripper transport element moves<br>
with the gripper and the weft thread to the middle area of the weaving<br>
shed, where it is likewise approached by a takeover gripper on a gripper<br>
transport element that takes over the inserted weft thread and then trans-<br>
ports the weft thread to the other side of the shed in a motion out of the<br>
weaving shed. Or the gripper transport element moves with a gripper, a<br>
take-over gripper, through the weaving shed and catches a weft thread that<br>
is then pulled through the shed. The gripper transport elements are guided<br>
within the shed by means of guide elements that are fixed on the slay.<br>
They move with the slay, whereby they penetrate into a warp-thread sheet<br>
from below, when the reed is moved away from the fell line of the cloth.<br>
They again move out of the shed through the lower warp-thread sheet,<br>
when the newly inserted weft thread is beaten up by the reed at the fell line<br>
of the cloth.<br>
Hook-shaped guide elements are known (EP 02 75 479 B1), whose open<br>
side faces the reed. They serve particularly for guiding a gripper transport<br>
element designed as a gripper band. They have a guide associated to the<br>
upper side of the gripper transport element and a guide associated to the<br><br>
opposite lower side of the gripper transport element. A further guide is pro-<br>
vided for a side surface of the gripper transport band, on the side facing<br>
away from the open side. The lower and/or upper guide engage in a longi-<br>
tudinal groove of the lower side and/or the upper side of the gripper band,<br>
whereby the sides of the guides, facing away from the open side, secure<br>
the gripper band against movement towards the open side. The guides for<br>
preventing the movement of the gripper band in the direction towards the<br>
open side are relatively small. This causes substantial abrasion on the<br>
guide elements and on the gripper transport elements in a relatively short<br>
time.<br>
C-shaped guide elements are also known (WO 94/10364), which are like-<br>
wise open towards the reed. The gripper transport element that in this<br>
case can also be a flexible gripper band is guided on the open side of the<br>
guide element by means of two opposite portions of guides, which prevent<br>
movement in the horizontal direction towards the reed. The upper side<br>
and the lower side of the gripper transport element keep a distance from<br>
the opposite portions of the guide elements, so that they are not guided.<br>
The gripper transport element has a section extending through the open<br>
side of the guide elements, which is guided in vertical direction between<br>
the opposite portions of the guides. Also with this type, in particular in the<br>
direction towards the reed, only relatively small guides are provided, so<br>
that rapid abrasion is expected.<br>
Further guides are known (EP 07 15 009 Al), which support a gripper band<br>
only on the lower side and thereby engage in a longitudinal groove of the<br>
lower side of the gripper band. The gripper band and the gripper are se-<br>
cured against lifting only by means of gravity. It is expected that such<br>
guide elements are not adequate in case of very high weaving speeds,<br>
since the gripper bands lift and/or are prone to kinking.<br><br>
The invention has the object to provide guide elements of the type men-<br>
tioned at the beginning, which improve the guidance of the gripper transport<br>
elements.<br>
This object is achieved in that, the frame is provided with at least a projection<br>
associated to a longitudinal groove of the lower side of the gripper transport<br>
element, and a shoulder adjoining the projection on the open side, whose<br>
upper edge forms a guide for the gripper transport element located below<br>
the upper edge of the projection.<br>
Since the frame encloses the gripper transport element with the guides that<br>
are associated to the upper side and to the lower side of the gripper trans-<br>
port element, relatively large guides are obtained without the dimensions<br>
having to be increased. It is even possible to reduce the size of the cross-<br>
sections of the gripper transport elements without having to reduce the size<br>
of the guides and guide surfaces. Smaller cross-sections lead to smaller<br>
masses and therefore allow higher weaving speeds. Particularly advanta-<br>
geous is the shoulder which projects from the frame to the open side. This<br>
shoulder on the one hand forms a support for a part of the gripper transport<br>
element located outside the frame so that the transport element can be sup-<br>
ported against torsional forces. Furthermore, the shoulder reduces the dan-<br>
ger that warp-threads get caught in the guide elements, which could lead to<br>
damage of the warp-threads and/or to warp-thread breaks.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided<br>
that, the shoulder is designed as a pike protruding away from the frame.<br>
This pike can be inserted between two warp-threads that have already been<br>
pushed apart by the upper edge of the guide elements.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, the upper<br>
edge of the guide element has a highest point that is located in the area<br><br>
above the open side of the frame. The upper edge of the guide elements<br>
first meets the warp-thread sheet and presses the warp-threads some-<br>
what apart. The shoulder lies in the "shadow" of the upper edge, so that<br>
it easily penetrates between the warp-threads that are already pushed<br>
apart. The danger that warp-threads will be caught is therefore signifi-<br>
cantly reduced. Likewise, the danger that warp-threads may contact the<br>
guides for the gripper transport element is reduced.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent<br>
from the following description of the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying draw- <br>
ings and in the dependent claims.<br>

with a gripper transport element at a different cross-section<br>
and<br>
Fig. 11 to 18 shows further embodiments of guide elements according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The guide elements shown in Fig. 1 to 18, like shown in EP 0576854 A1,<br>
are fixed on a slay that accommodates a reed as well. The slay executes<br>
to-and-from movements in order to beat up a weft thread at the cloth fell.<br>
Thereby, the guide elements are brought through the lower warp-thread<br>
sheet in a weaving shed, when the reed is in the rear position and a weft<br>
thread is inserted. To beat up the weft thread, the slay with the reed<br>
moves towards the cloth fell, whereby the guide elements, after the gripper<br>
transport element has been pulled back, again moves through the lower<br>
warp sheet out of the shed. In the drawings, only the position is shown in<br>
which the reed is located in the farthest position it moved back to and in<br>
which a gripper transport element is inserted into a shed. When the terms<br>
"upper" and "lower" are used, then they respectively refer to this position.<br><br>
The guide element 10, shown in Fig. 1 to 4 is provided with a fastening<br>
part 11, by which it is fastened to a slay or to an intermediate profile in a<br>
row with the identical guide elements. Above the fastening part 11 is the<br>
portion 12 of the guide element, which is meant to penetrate into a weav-<br>
ing shed. In this portion 12 the guide element has guides 14, 15, 16, 17<br>
and 18, positively enclosing a gripper transport element 19 (Fig. 3 and 4)<br>
or surrounding it, so that all the guides 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 are termed as a<br>
frame 13 for the gripper transport element 19. The frame 13 is open at<br>
one side, i.e. the side facing the reed (not shown). The guide 14 is asso-<br>
ciated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 19.<br>
The guide 15 guides the gripper transport element 19 on the side facing<br>
away from the open side, i.e. against the movements away from the open<br>
side. The guide 16 is associated to the upper side of the gripper transport<br>
element 19 and prevents movement of the gripper transport element 19 in<br>
upward direction. The guides 17 and 18 are lateral edges of the projec-<br>
tions 40, 41, which project from the guide 16, associated to the upper<br>
side or from the guide 14, associated to the lower side and leave a gap in<br>
between. The guide 18 essentially runs parallel to the guide 15. The<br>
guide 17 extends by an angle of about 45° to the guide 16. The upper<br>
edge of the gripper transport element 19 is inclined in shape, in the area<br>
at the open side of the frame 13. The gripper transport element 19 is in<br>
this manner advantageously guided in all directions by the guide ele-<br>
ments 10.<br>
From the lower projection 41 of the guide element 10, a shoulder 20 pro-<br>
trudes outwards from the frame 13, whose upper edge 43 lies as high as<br>
the guide 14 that is associated to the lower side of the gripper transport<br>
element 19. The upper edge 43 lies deeper than the upper edge 42 of the<br>
projection 41. The gripper transport element 19 has an enlargement 21<br>
(Fig. 4) extending at least over a part of its length with a length of, e.g.<br><br>
500 mm, which remains outside the frame 13 and is used to accommodate<br>
a gripper. The gripper transport element 19 can be a gripper band, which<br>
is relatively flexible about a horizontal axis, or a gripper rod that is rela-<br>
tively rigid to bending about a horizontal axis as well as about a vertical<br>
axis. The enlargement 21 can be formed on the gripper transport element<br>
19 as a single piece. In a modified embodiment, it is provided that, to the<br>
gripper transport element 19, a guiding part is attached, which completes<br>
and/or replaces the gripper transport element 19 over a part of its length<br>
and which features the enlargement 21 and carries the gripper. The shoul-<br>
der 20, with its upper edge 43 serving as a guide, supports the lower side<br>
of the gripper transport element in the area of the enlargement 21, so that<br>
torsional forces can be compensated.<br>
The guide element 10 in total has a somewhat plate-shaped form and is<br>
mounted on a slay such that the flat sides essentially run parallel to warp-<br>
threads. As seen in particular from Fig. 1 and 2, the portion 12 meant for<br>
penetrating into a shed of the guide element 10 is machined in such a<br>
manner that it tapers in the direction towards the open side towards the<br>
shoulder 20, which forms some kind of a pike. From this somewhat rounded<br>
pike of the shoulder 20, a lateral edge 22 runs in a manner of a rounded<br>
groove to the fastening part 11. The lateral edge 22 is chamfered and<br>
transforms into the flanks of the portion 12. Due to the tapering shape, the<br>
guide 15 is relatively wide and in this embodiment has a nearly uniform<br>
width. In a modified embodiment, the guide 15 has a trapezoidal shape.<br>
The guide 14 tapers in contrast, in the direction towards the open side and<br>
has approximately a trapezoidal shape. The same applies to the guides 16<br>
and 17. The projection 41 with the guide 18 has a rounded upper edge 42<br>
and chamfered side surfaces that taper upwards, which transform into the<br>
flanks of the portion 12. The portion 12 has an upper edge 23 that is<br>
rounded. The surfaces adjoining the upper edge 23 are chamfered so that<br><br>
they run up to the guides 16, 17 in an inclined manner with respect to the<br>
flanks of the portion 12.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3 and 4, the upper edge 23 has a highest point 24,<br>
which lies in the area of the open side of the frame 13. This highest point 24<br>
is the point by which the guide element 10 first enters into a warp-thread<br>
sheet and thereby spreads the warp-threads apart. The warp-threads then<br>
slide on the inclined surfaces, which adjoin the upper edge 23. They are then<br>
already spread relatively widely apart when the projection 41 and the shoul-<br>
der 20 enter their area. Since the shoulder 20 lies under the upper edge 42<br>
of the projection 41, and is preferably formed as a pike, it will penetrate be-<br>
tween the already spread warp-threads. As the projection 41 tapers up-<br>
wards and lies below the projection 40, it is shielded by the latter. The pro-<br>
jection 41 can therefore easily enter between the already spread warp-<br>
threads.<br>
As the shoulder 20 and in particular also its upper edge 43 lies lower than<br>
the projection 40, the shoulder 20 can therefore enter between the warp-<br>
threads already spread apart by the projection 41 and the projection 40,<br>
without damaging warp threads. The shoulder 20 is shielded by the projec-<br>
tions 40 and 41, so that it does not catch warp-threads, which run inclined<br>
to the rest of the warp-threads. Due to this, it is achieved that no warp-<br>
threads remain lying on the upper edge 43 of the shoulder 20, which could<br>
then be caught by the gripper transport element and be torn apart or be<br>
damaged. A particularly good spreading-apart of warp-threads is then<br>
achieved if the guide element 10 is made relatively wide in the area of the<br>
guide 15.<br>
As seen, in particular from Fig. 1 and 2, all edges of the thread guide ele-<br>
ments 10, which could contact the threads and/or the gripper transport ele-<br><br>
ment are rounded. Also the outer edge lying behind the guide 15, and facing<br>
away from the open side, is rounded and chamfered over a wide section.<br>
The embodiments according to Fig. 5 and 6 correspond in principle to the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 4, whereby the guides are opposite one<br>
another in pairs and run perpendicular relative to one another in pairs. The<br>
guides 14, 16 guide the gripper transport element 19 against movement in<br>
vertical direction. The guides 15, 18 and 27 run parallel to one another and<br>
prevent movement of the gripper transport element 19 in horizontal direction.<br>
The gripper transport element 19 of Fig. 5 is provided with an enlargement<br>
28, which is smaller in height than the height of the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment. In the embodiment according to Fig. 6, it is provided that, the portions<br>
forming the outer sides of the guides 18 and 27 also serve as guides 45, 46,<br>
which are opposite corresponding surfaces of the enlargement 29 of the<br>
gripper transport element 19. Due to this, good support is achieved against<br>
possible active torsional forces in the area of the enlargement 29.<br>
In a modified embodiment relative to Fig. 5 and 6, it is provided that the upper<br>
edge of the guide elements is designed such that it has the highest point in the<br>
area of the open-side similar to the highest point 24 of the embodiment ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 1 to 4, by which the guide elements first enter a warp sheet.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 7 to 10 in its basic design corresponds to<br>
the embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 4, so that reference is made to the de-<br>
scription of Fig. 1 to 4 and the same reference numbers are used. In the em-<br>
bodiment according to Fig. 7 to 10, it is additionally provided that from the<br>
guide 14 associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 19 a<br>
projection 30 protrudes into the frame 13. This projection 30 forms additional<br>
side guides that prevent movement of the gripper transport element in hori-<br><br>
zontal direction and in particular in the direction towards the open side.<br>
Enlargement of the guides help to reduce abrasion.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 11, which essentially corresponds with<br>
the embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 4, the upper edge 43 of the shoulder<br>
20 is offset downwards relative to the guide 14. This further reduces the dan-<br>
ger that warp-threads have contact with the upper edge 43 of the shoulder<br>
20, as the warp-threads are spread through the projection 41 and the adjoin-<br>
ing side surfaces of the guide element. The danger of damage to the warp-<br>
threads is the lower, the greater the distance between the upper edge 42 of<br>
the projections 41 and the upper edge 43 of the shoulder 20 is. The embodi-<br>
ment according to Fig. 12 differs from the embodiment according to Fig. 11,<br>
in that, a projection 30 is provided, which protrudes from the guide 14 and<br>
engages into a longitudinal groove of the gripper transport element 19.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 13, which broadly corresponds to the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 11, a distance or clearance is provided be-<br>
tween the upper edge 42 of the projection 41 and the groove root of the lon-<br>
gitudinal groove of the gripper transport element 19. Thus, it is avoided that<br>
the relatively narrow upper edge created in the area of the groove root of the<br>
longitudinal groove of the gripper transport element increases wear. In the<br>
example of the embodiment according to Fig. 13, a distance or clearance is<br>
provided between the lower side 44 of the projection 40 of the guide element<br>
10 and the groove root of a longitudinal groove of the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment 19.<br>
The gripper transport element 19 according to Fig. 14 has a flat, rectangular<br>
cross section and is particularly suitable for use as a gripper band, which can<br>
be guided by means of a guide block around a drive wheel of a gripper weav-<br>
ing machine. The gripper transport element 19 is guided by means of a guide<br>
element 80 that has a guide 81 for the smooth upper side of the gripper trans-<br><br>
port element 19 that is not profiled by a groove or the like. The guide of the<br>
guide element 80 associated to the lower side of the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment is provided with a projection 41 that engages into a longitudinal groove<br>
of the gripper transport element 19. Also in this embodiment a shoulder 20 is<br>
provided, whose upper edge lies deeper than the upper edge of the projec-<br>
tion 41 and is thus shielded in the manner already described when entering<br>
into a warp sheet.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 15 differs from the embodiment according<br>
to Fig. 14 in that a second projection 30 protrudes from the guide 88 associ-<br>
ated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 19. The longitudinal<br>
grooves of the gripper transport element 19 and the projections 30, 41 are<br>
matched to one another such that clearance is provided between the upper<br>
edges of the projections 30, 41 and the groove root of the longitudinal<br>
grooves of the gripper transport element 19.<br>
As shown by means of Fig. 16, the upper edge 43 of the shoulder 20 must<br>
not be lower than the guide 88 in similarity to the exemplary embodiment ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 14 or 15. It is, however, essential that the upper edge 43 of<br>
the shoulder 20 is disposed lower than the upper edge 42 of the projection<br>
41.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 17, the projection 41 in the direction of<br>
the width of the gripper transport element 19 is kept relatively wide. The guide<br>
element 80 only forms guides with the upper edge of the projection 41 and<br>
the upper edge 43 of the shoulder 20, which prevent movement of the gripper<br>
transport element downwards. A clearance 84 is provided in the area facing<br>
away from the open side between the guide element 80 and the lower side of<br>
the gripper transport element 19.<br><br>
In Fig. 18 a modified embodiment of Fig. 17 is shown, with which the upper<br>
side of the gripper transport element 19 is provided with a longitudinal groove<br>
in which a projection 86 of the guide element 80 engages opposite the projec-<br>
tion 41. The gripper transport element 19 is guided in vertical direction only<br>
by the upper edge of the projection 41 and the lower edge of the projection<br>
86. Clearance 85 is provided adjacent to the guide 87 between the upper<br>
side of the gripper transport element and the guide element 80.<br>
The guide elements formed according to Fig. 14 to 18 are particularly well<br>
suited to absorb torsional forces which may be introduced in the gripper<br>
transport element 19 due to the arrangement of a gripper (not shown) in par-<br>
ticular during accelerations and decelerations.<br>
Modified embodiments provide that the shoulder 20 facing away from the open<br>
side of the guide elements 10 or 80 is not designed as a tapered pike, but is<br>
provided with parallel surfaces. This design in particular is then possible if the<br>
guide elements 10, 80 in the area of the guides 15, 87 are relatively wide and<br>
therefore warp-threads are widely spread, when the upper edge 43 of the<br>
shoulder 20 reaches in the area of the warp-threads.<br>
The invention is not limited to the shown exemplary embodiments. Particu-<br>
larly, it is possible to implement the features described in the individual ex-<br>
emplary embodiments also with other exemplary embodiments. For instance,<br>
it is possible also with the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 5 or 6, to<br>
provide a projection according to the projection 30. Likewise, it is possible with<br>
the embodiments according to Fig. 1 to 4 or 7 to 10 to use other gripper<br>
transport elements, in particular, gripper transport elements that are provided<br>
with enlargements 28 or 29 according to Fig. 5 and 6. With further modified<br>
embodiments, thus, in the area of the guide 16 associated to the upper side<br>
of the gripper transport element 19, one or several shoulders are provided,<br><br>
projecting into the frame 13 in accordance with the projection 30 of Fig. 7<br>
and 10.<br><br>
