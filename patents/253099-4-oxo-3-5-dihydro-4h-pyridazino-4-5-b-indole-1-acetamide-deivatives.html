				<td>Some 2-phenylpyridazino[ 4,5-b] indole-1,4-dione derivatives are known from the GB2290292 patent application as NMDA and AMPA antagonists. Some 1H-pyrido [ 3,4-b]indole-4-carboxamide derivatives are also known as useful for the treatment of diseases linked to disorders of GABAergic transmission.<br>
The subject-matter of the present invention is 4-oxo-3, 5-dihydro-4h-pyridazino[ 4,5-B] indole-1-acetamide-derivative compounds of general formula (I)<br><br>
in which<br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a methyl,<br>
methoxy or phenylmethoxy group,<br>
Y represents a hydrogen atom, 1 or 2 halogen atoms or a<br>
hydroxyl, methoxy, nitro or methyl group,<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
R2 and R3 each represent, independently of one another,<br>
a hydrogen atom, a (C1-C4)alkyl group or a phenylmethyl<br>
group,<br>
or else R2 and R3 form, with the nitrogen atom which<br>
carries them, an- azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, 3-<br>
ethoxypyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, 4-<br>
methylpiperazinyl or 1,3-thiazolidinyl group, the<br>
respective formulae of which are as follows:<br><br><br>
The preferred compounds are those in the general formula of which X is in the 8 or 9 position and represents a hydrogen or halogen atom, Y represents a hydrogen atom, R1 represents a methyl or ethyl group, R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and R3 represents a methyl group or else R2 and R3 form, with the nitrogen atom which carries them, an azetidinyl or pyrrolidinyl ring.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by processes illustrated in the following schemes.<br>
According to Scheme 1, a compound of general formula (II) , in which X and R1 are as defined above and R' represents a (C1-C4)alkyl group, is reacted with oxalyl chloride, in an aprotic solvent, such as toluene, between 50°C and the reflux temperature, the reaction intermediate is then treated at room temperature with an alcohol of general formula R"OH, in which R" represents a (C1-C4) alkyl group, in order to obtain the diester of general formula (III), or else the compound of general formula (II) is reacted with an alkyl chloroglyoxylate in a polar aprotic solvent, such as dichloromethane, at room temperature, in the<br><br>
presence of a Lewis acid, for example titanium tetrachloride, in order to obtain the diester of general formula (III).<br>
The latter is subsequently treated in acetic acid, first at room temperature and then at the reflux temperature, with a phenylhydrazine optionally substituted by a Y group as defined above, in order to obtain an ester of general formula (IV). When R1 represents an alkyl group, this ester is converted to the corresponding alcohol, of general formula (V), by reduction by means of a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride, in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an alcohol, for example methanol. This alcohol (V) is subsequently converted to the halogenated compound of general formula (VIII) by any reaction known to a person skilled in the art, either, for example, treatment with carbon tetrabromide in the presence of triphenylphosphine, in a solvent such as dichloromethane, or else by the action of a chlorinating agent, such as methanesulphonyl chloride, in a mixture of solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and pyridine.<br><br><br><br><br>
A nucleophilic substitution reaction with the cyanide ion is subsequently carried out, either in a mixture of polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and water, at<br><br>
a temperature of 20 to 80°C, or in a two-phase mixture, such as water and dichloromethane, between room temperature and the reflux temperature, in the presence of a phase transfer agent, in order to obtain the compound of general formula (IX).<br>
An acidic hydrolysis is subsequently carried out, for example by using a mixture of acetic acid and of hydrochloric acid, at the reflux temperature, or else a basic hydrolysis is subsequently carried out, for example by using potassium hydroxide in a mixture of solvents, such as water and 2-methoxyethanol, at the reflux temperature, in order to obtain the compound of general formula (X).<br>
This acid is subsequently converted to the secondary or tertiary amide of general formula (I) by reaction with an amine of general formula HNR2R3, in which R2 and R3 are as defined above, via the intermediacy, for example, of the imidazolide obtained by reaction with 1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole.<br>
It is possible, if a final compound of general formula (I) in which R, represents hydrogen is desired, to convert a compound of general formula (IV) in which R1 represents hydrogen to a compound of general formula (IV) in which R represents a protective group, such as the methoxymethyl group, for example, by an alkylation reaction known to a person skilled in the art. The conversions according to Scheme 1 are continued until the compound of general formula (IX) is<br><br>
obtained and then an acidic hydrolysis of the latter, which at the same time removes the methoxymethyl protective group, results in a compound of general formula (X) in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom.<br>
According to Scheme 2, the compound of general formula (II) as defined above is converted to a compound of general formula (VI) by any method known to a person skilled in the art, for example by an electrophilic reaction in acidic medium. The latter is subsequently treated in acetic acid, first at room temperature and then at the reflux temperature, with a phenylhydrazine optionally substituted by a Y group as defined above. A compound of general formula (VII) is obtained, which is converted to the corresponding halogenated derivative of general formula (VIII) by a radical-type reaction, for example by using N-bromosuccinimide, in a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, in the presence of an agent such as 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile). The compound of general formula (VIII) is subsequently treated as described with respect to Scheme 1.<br>
It is possible, if desired, to convert a compound of general formula (I) in which X represents a halogen atom to a compound of general formula (I) in which X represents a methyl group by any coupling reaction known to a person skilled in the art, for example by using tetramethyltin in the presence of a<br><br><br>
palladium complex.<br>
Likewise, a compound of general formula (I), in which Y represents a methoxy group, can be converted to a compound in the formula of which Y represents a hydroxyl group by any known method, for example by the<br><br>
action of boron tribromide, in a chlorinated solvent, such as dichloromethane.<br>
It is also possible, if desired, to convert a compound of general formula (I) in which X represents a chlorine atom to a compound of general formula (I) in which R represents hydrogen, for example by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium-on-charcoal. According to Scheme 3, a compound of general formula (V), in which R1 represents an alkyl group and X represents a chlorine atom, is converted to a compound of general formula (XI) by oxidation of the alcohol functional group, for example by using manganese dioxide in absolvent such as dichloromethane. The aldehyde (XI) is subsequently converted to a nitrile of general formula (XII) by reaction with (4-methylbenzenesulphonyl)methyl isocyanide ("TosMIC") in a solvent, such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, in the presence of a base, such as potassium 1,1-dimethylethoxide. The nitrile (XII) is subsequently converted to an ester of general formula (XIII), in which R" represents a lower alkyl group, by the action of an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, in an alcoholic solvent of formula R"OH.<br>
Finally, this ester (XIII) is converted to the secondary or tertiary amide of general formula (I) by reaction with an amine of general formula HNR2R2, in which R2 and R3 are as defined above, for example in the presence of a trialkylaluminium derivative, in a<br><br>
solvent such as toluene.<br>
The starting compounds of general formula (II), mainly when R1 represents hydrogen, are described in the literature. If desired, the compound in the formula of which R1 represents hydrogen can be subjected to an alkylation reaction in order to result in a compound in the formula of which R1 represents an alkyl group.<br>
The examples which will follow illustrate the preparation of some compounds according to the invention. The elemental microanalyses and the I.R. and N.M.R. spectra confirm the structures of the compounds obtained.<br>
The numbers shown between brackets in the titles of the examples correspond to those in the 1st column of Table 1 given later.<br>
In the names of the compounds, the dash "-" forms part of the word and the dash "_" is only used for the line end break; it is to be omitted in the absence of a break and must not be replaced either by a hyphen or by a space.<br>

The compounds of the invention were subjected to pharmacological tests which demonstrated their advantage as substances having therapeutic activities.<br>
Study of membrane binding with respect to ω1receptors of the cerebellum (type 1 benzodiazepine) and ω2 receptors of the spinal cord (type 2 benzodiazepine).<br>
The affinity of the compounds for the ω1 receptors of the cerebellum and Ω2 receptors of the spinal cord was determined according to a variant of the method described by S.Z. Langer and S. Arbilla in Fund. Clin. Pharmacol., 2, 159-170 (1988), with the use of [3H] flumazenil instead of [3H] diazepam as radioligand. The cerebellar or spinal cord tissue is homogenized for<br>
60 s in 120 or 30 volumes, respectively, of ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mM.NaCl, 5 mM KCl) and then, after dilution to 1/3, the suspension is incubated with [3H]flumazenil (specific activity 78 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) at a concentration of 1 riM and with the compounds of the invention at different concentrations; in a final volume of 525 µl. After 30 minutes of incubation at 0°C, the samples are filtered under reduced pressure on Whatman GF/B® filters and washed immediately with ice-cold buffer. The specific binding of [3H]flumazenil is determined in the presence of 1 µM unlabelled diazepam. The data are analysed according to standard methods and the IC50<br><br>
concentration, the concentration which inhibits by 50% the binding of [3H]flumazenil, is calculated. The IC50 values of the most closely related compounds of the invention lie between 5 and 1000 nM for the ω1 receptors of the cerebellum and between -2 0 and 10 00 -nM for the ω2 receptors of the spinal cord. Study of the anxiolytic activity-Drink intake conflict test.<br>
The anxiolytic activity is evaluated in rats in the drink intake conflict test according to the method described by J.R. Vogel, B. Beer and D.E. Clody in Psychopharmacologia (Berl.), 21, 1-7 (1971). After being deprived of water for 48 h, the rat is placed in a soundproof chamber equipped with a water pipette connected to an anxiometer which delivers a mild electric shock every 20 licks. The number of shocks received is automatically counted over 3 minutes and makes it possible to evaluate the anxiolytic activity of the tested compounds. The results are expressed by the minimum effective dose (MED), the dose which produces a significant increase in the number of shocks received, with respect to the number observed in the control animals.<br>
The MED values of the most active compounds lie, in this test, between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg via the intraperitoneal or oral route. Test in a heightened cross-shaped maze<br>
The protocol of this test is a modification of<br><br>
that described by S. Pellow and S. File in Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. (1986), 24, 525-529.<br>
After a period of accustomization to the experimental room lasting approximately 24 h, the rats are placed individually on the central -platform, the muzzle directed towards one of the closed arms, and observed for 4 min using a video camera. The time spent by the animal in the open arms, the number of entries into the closed arms and into the open arms, the number of attempts to enter the open arms, followed by an avoidance response, and the exploration of the edges in the open arms are recorded. The results are expressed for each animal: 1) as percentage of passages into the open arms relative to the total number of entries into the four arms of the apparatus, 2) as percentage of time spent in the open arms relative to the total duration of the test (4 min), 3) as total number of abortive attempts made by the animal, 4) as total number of explorations.<br>
The products under study are administered intraperitoneally or orally at increasing doses. The results are expressed by the minimum effective dose (MED) which produces either a significant increase (activity in the open arms) or a significant decrease (attempts) relative to the performance observed in the control animals.<br>
The MED values of the most active compounds lie, in this test, between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg via the<br><br>
intraperitoneal or oral route. Study of the hypnotic activity.<br>
The sedative or hypnotic activity of the compounds was determined by observing their action on the rat's electrocorticogram, according to the method described by H. Depoortere, Rev. E.E.G. Neurophysiol. , 10, 3, 207-214 (1980) and by H. Depoortere and M. Decobert, J. Pharmacol., (Paris), 14, 2, 195-265 (1983).<br>
The products under study were administered intraperitoneally at increasing doses. The most active compounds induce sleep patterns at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3 0 mg/kg.<br>
Study of the anticonvulsant activity.<br>
Activity with respect to clonic convulsions induced in rats by injection of pentetrazol.<br>
The protocol of this test is a modification of that described by E.A. Swinyard and J.H. Woodhead in Antiepileptic Drugs, Raven Press, New York, 111-126 (1982).<br>
The test products are administered to the animals intraperitoneally 3 0 min before an intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of pentetrazol. Immediately after the injection, the number of animals exhibiting clonic convulsions is noted over 5 min.<br>
The results are expressed as the AD50., the dose which protects 50% of the animals, calculated according to the method of J.T. Lichtfield and F. Wilcoxon<br><br>
(J". Pharm. Exp. Ther. (1949), 96, 99-113) on the basis of 3 or 4 doses each administered to a group of 8 to 10 rats.<br>
The AD50 values of the most active compounds lie between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg via the intraperitonealor oral route. Study of the anticonvulsant activity.<br>
Activity with respect to isoniazid-induced convulsions in mice.<br>
The intrinsic activity of the compounds is determined by the latency time of onset of convulsions induced by the subcutaneous administration of isoniazid (800 mg/kg) simultaneously with the test compound injected intraperitoneally, according to the protocol described by G. Perrault, E. Morel, D. Sanger and B. Zivkovic in Eur. J. Pharmacol., 156, 189-196 (1988). The results are expressed as the AD50, the dose which produces 50% of the maximum effect, relative to the control animals, determined on the basis of 3 or 4 doses each administered to a group of 8 to 10 mice. The AD50 values of the most active compounds lie, in this test, between 1 and 20 mg/kg via the intraperitoneal route and, depending on the compounds, the maximum effect can be as much as 400%.<br>
The results of the tests performed on the compounds of the invention show that, in vitro, they displace [3H] flumazenil from its ω1 specific binding sites in the cerebellum and ω2 specific binding sites in the spinal cord; they exhibit an affinity for the ω3 and<br><br>
ω2 sites situated in the GABAA - ω sites - chlorine<br>
channel macromolecular complex.<br>
In vivo, they behave as full or partial agonists with<br>
respect to these receptor subtypes.<br>
They possess anxiolytic, hypnotic and anticonvulsant<br>
properties.<br>
Consequently, they can be used for the treatment of<br>
complaints associated with disorders of GABAergic<br>
transmission, such as anxiety, sleep disorders,<br>
epilepsy, spasticity, muscle contractures, cognitive<br>
disorders, withdrawal disorders related to alcoholism,<br>
tobacco or drugs, and the like.<br>
They can also be used for the treatment of Parkinson's<br>
disease and all types of extrapyramidal syndromes.<br>
Finally, they can be used in premedication and as<br>
general anaesthetics for the induction and/or<br>
maintenance of anaesthesia, or as local anaesthetics,<br>
optionally in combination with other anaesthetics<br>
and/or muscle relaxants and/or analgesics.<br>
They can be presented in any composition form appropriate for enteral, parenteral or transdermal administration, such as tablets, dragees, capsules, including hard gelatin capsules, suspensions or solutions to be swallowed or injected, such as syrups or phials, transdermal patches, and the like, in combination with suitable excipients, containing a dose which permits a daily administration of 1 to 1000 mg of active substance.<br><br>
