THEIR USE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/825,531, filed September 13, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] NOT APPLICABLE<br>
REFERENCE TO A "SEQUENCE LISTING," A TABLE, OR A COMPUTER PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISK. [0003] NOT APPLICABLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention relates to structures of demethyl, hydroxyl, demethylhydroxyl and epoxide macrocyclic lactones, their synthesis, pharmaceutical compositions and use for systemic and site specific therapeutic applications.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0005] Rapamycin (Sirolimus) is a 31 -member natural macrocyclic lactone [C51H79N1O13 ; MWt = 914.2 ] produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and found in the 1970s (US Pat No. 3,929,992 ; 3,993,749). Rapamycin (structure shown below) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection in 1999.<br><br>
[0006] Rapamycin resembles tacrolimus (binds to the same intracellular binding protein or immunophilin known as FKBP-12) but differs in its mechanism of action. Whereas tacrolimus and cyclosporine inhibit T-cell activation by blocking lymphokine (e.g., IL2) gene transcription, sirolimus inhibits T-cell activation and T lymphocyte proliferation by binding to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Rapamycin can act in synergy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus in suppressing the immune system.<br>
[0007] Rapamycin is also useful in preventing or treating systemic lupus erythematosus [U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,999], pulmonary inflammation [U.S. Pat. No. 5,080,899], insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,009], skin disorders, such as psoriasis [U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,730], bowel disorders [U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,731], smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening following vascular injury [U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,288,711 and 5,516,781], adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [European Patent Application 525,960 A1], ocular inflammation [U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,589], malignant carcinomas [U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,018], cardiac inflammatory disease [U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,832], anemia [U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,138] and increase neurite outgrowth [Parker, E. M. et al, Neuropharmacology 39, 1913-1919,2000].<br><br>
[0008] Although rapamycin can be used to treat various disease conditions, the utility of the compound as a pharmaceutical drug has been restricted by its very low and variable bioavailability and its high immunosuppressive potency and potential high toxicity. Also, rapamycin is only very slightly soluble in water. To overcome these problems, prodrugs and analogues of the compound have been synthesized. Water soluble prodrugs prepared by derivatizing rapamycin positions 31 and 42 (formerly positions 28 and 40) of the rapamycin structure to form glycinate, propionate, and pyrrolidino butyrate prodrugs have been described (U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,803). Some of the analogues of rapamycin described in the art include monoacyl and diacyl analogues (U.S. Pat. No. 4,316,885), acetal analogues (U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,413), silyl ethers (U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,842), hydroxyesters (U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,718), as well as alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl analogues (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,665,772; 5,258,389; 6,384,046; WO 97/35575).<br>
[0009] Prodrugs and analogues of rapamycin are synthesized by chemical synthesis, where additional synthetic steps are required to protect and deprotect certain positions. Analogues can also be synthesized biologically, where the Streptomyces strain is genetically modified to produce these analogues of rapamycin. The analogues need to maintain necessary positions for protein binding or other cellular interactions and not generate steric hindrance in order to preserve its activity. The safety of these analogues requires extensively testing by series of preclinical and clinical experimentations.<br>
[0010] The present invention comprises novel macrocyclic lactones and novel uses for macrocyclic lactones, where the compositions can be synthesized chemically or biologically and which preserve at least some immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, anti-fungal and antitμMor properties for use in systemic and site specific applications.<br><br>

[0098] In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be applied adjacent to the surface of the implant. For example the compounds of the present invention can be incorporated within the implant, contained within a coating, or carried on the implant.<br>
[0099] In some embodiments, the present invention provides a device comprising a vascular prosthesis wherein the vascular prosthesis has a lμMinal and a tissue facing surface, and wherein the compound is associated with at least one of the lμMinal or tissue facing surfaces.<br>

joined by links or connectors 140. It is understood that the connectors may be of any length or shape, or may not be needed if the crowns are directly attached to each other. The stent has a typical contracted state diameter of between 0.25 - 4mm, or more preferably between 0.7 to 1.5mm, and a length of between 5 and 100 mm. In its expanded state, the stent diameter is typically at least twice and up to 10 times or more than that of the stent in its contracted state.

Eliminating MCP-1 gene or blockade of MCP-1 signals has been shown to decrease atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice. MCP-1 has been shown to play a role in pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia in monkeys. (Importance of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 Pathway in Neointimal Hyperplasia After Periarterial Injury in Mice and Monkeys, Circ Res. 2002;90:1167-1172.) MCP-1 is also strongly expressed in a small subset of cells in macrophage-rich regions of hμMan and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions (Expression of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 in Macrophage-Rich Areas of HμMan and Rabbit Atherosclerotic Lesions, PNAS, Vol 88, 5252-5256). Inhibition of MCP-1 can have therapeutic impact on treatment and prevention of inflammatory, proliferative and other disease conditions discussed above.<br>
[0147] Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with a powerful inhibitory effect on monocytes. IL-10 has been shown to reduce postinjury intimal hyperplasia<br><br>
(Interleukin-10 Inhibits Intimal Hyperplasia After Angioplasty or Stent Implantation in Hypercholesterolemic RabbitsCirculation. 2000;101:908-916). Endogenous production of IL-10 by hμMan monocytes in response to LDL stimulation inhibits IL-12 production, indicating a cross-regulatory action of IL-10 that may counterbalance the proinflammatory response<br>
[0148] It can be appreciated that all embodiments disclosed in the present invention can be utilized alone or in combination with other embodiments or examples in this invention.<br>
V. Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 16-O-demethyl macrocyclic lactone (Compound AR)<br>
[0149] Macrocyclic lactone rapamycin (1000 mg, 10.75 mmol) in 500ml acetonitrile was treated with 500ml 0.1N hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for about 28 hours. Then the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane in a separatory funnel. The organic layers were washed with water and brine, then washed with 0.1M sodiμM phosphate buffer (pH=7.4) twice or until pH=7, then washed three times with distilled (DI) water. Finally the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and placed in a refrigerator overnight. Concentration in vacuμM provided an off-white powder of Compound AR (approx. 820 mg).<br>
[0150] Compound AR was purified by preparative HPLC on an Ascentis C18 (21.2 x 250mm, 10μm) colμMn from SUPECO using Methanol:water (80:20) as mobile phase from 0-12 min then changed to 100% Methanol from 12.01-20min at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. The loading concentration was 350 mg/ml and the injection volμMe was 100 ul. The compound was monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm. Under these conditions, Compound AR eluted between 9.0-11.5 min whereas the starting materials and by products eluted between 17.0-20.0 min.<br>
[0151] The preparative HPLC can also be conducted using a gradient of acetonitrile:water (starting from 70:30) as mobile phase and monitored by UV absorbance at 278 nm. The preparative HPLC chromatogram using this method of separation is shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0152] The fractions containing Compound AR were collected and pooled together, then solvent was evaporated by using a rotovac and freeze drier to give an off-white powder of Compound AR.<br><br><br>
[0154] Compared with the proton NMR of the parent compound, the disappearance of the peak at 3.14 ppm demonstrates the demethylation at the C16 position only and completion of reaction. (See Journal of Antibiotics 1991, 44(6), 688 for assignment of the NMR spectra for rapamycin.)<br>
[0155] The chemical structure of Compound AR was further verified by mass spectrometric experiments. The fragmentation patterns indicated the presence of the m/z 900 whereas Rapamycin provides m/z 914 under the same conditions. The results of liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy experiments are provided in Figure 6 which shows the identification of Compound AR with m/z 900.<br>
[0156] The total content of Compound AR was determined by a reverse phase HPLC using a Supelco C18 (4.6 x 150mm, 5μm) colμMn from Sigma Aldrich using methanol:water (90:10) as mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Compound AR was monitored by UV absorbance at 254nm. Compound AR had a retention time of 7.97 min. Figure 7 shows the analytical HPLC chromatogram of Compound AR with total content of &gt;98%. The purity of Compound AR was determined by a reverse phase HPLC using a YMC ODS-AL C18 (4.6x250mm, 5 μm) colμMn from Waters Corporation using an acetonitrile:water gradient mobile phase and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Figure 7b shows major isomers of Compound AR with a purity &gt; 98% as monitored by UV absorbance at 278nm.<br>
[0157] As a means to minimize oxidation of the Compound AR, 0.1% w/w of Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added after preparative HPLC.<br>
Example 2: Biological activity of Compound AR<br>
[0158] Potency of the Compound AR was demonstrated by in vitro hμMan smooth muscle cell culture testing. The amounts of incorporated thymidine for samples of Compound AR of<br><br>
varying concentrations (0.005,0.01, 0.05, 0.1,0.5, and 1 μM) and of rapamycin of varying concentrations (0.0005, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 μM) were measured after exposure for different times of 1, 3 and 8 hours. The IC50 for Compound AR and rapamycin were approximately 0.05 and 0.01 μM, respectively, after smooth muscle cells were exposed to Compound AR and rapamycin for the shorter periods of 1 and 3 hours (as shown in Table 1 and Figure 8). The IC50 of Compound AR and rapamycin was approximately 0.005 and 0.001 μM, respectively, after smooth muscle cells were exposure to Compound AR and rapamycin for 8 hours. The IC50 of Compound AR was approximately five times higher than that of rapamycin.<br><br>
Example 3: Preparation of Stents Containing Compound AR<br>
[0159] 15 mg poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) was dissolved into 3 mL dichloromethane at room temperature. 10 mg of Compound AR was placed in a vial and dissolved in 2 mL dichloromethane with or without 0.1% (w/w) BHT. The solutions were combined and further diluted with 10 mL dichloromethane.<br>
[0160] A microprocessor-controlled ultrasonic sprayer was used to apply 450 ug of the drug containing PBMA solution to the entire surface of a l8 mm metal stent (available from Elixir Medical Corp, Sunnyvale, Calif.). After coating, the stent was placed in a vacuμM chamber. The stent was then mounted on the balloon of a 3.0 x 20 mm PTCA delivery catheter. The catheter was then inserted in a coil and packaged in a Tyvek® pouch. The<br><br>
pouch was sterilized by ethylene oxide. The Tyvek® pouch was further packaged in a foil pouch with oxygen scavengers and nitrogen purge and vacuum sealed.<br>
Example 4; In vivo Testing of Stents Eluting Compound AR<br>
[0161] The efficacy of a Compound AR eluting stent system (as prepared above) from Example 3 was evaluated by comparing 28±2 day angiographic outcomes in porcine coronary arteries to the rapamycin eluting stent system, Cypher™ Coronary Stent (Cordis Corporation) in the non-diseased porcine coronary artery model.<br>
[0162] The nonatherosclerotic swine model was chosen as this model has been used extensively for stent and angioplasty studies resulting in a large volume of data on the vascular response properties and its correlation to human vascular response (Schwartz et al, Circulation. 2002;106:1867-1873). The animals were housed and cared for in accordance the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as established by the National Research Council.<br>
[0163] All animals were pretreated with aspirin (325mg) and clopidogel (75mg) per oral dose beginning at least 3 days prior to the intervention and continuing for the duration of the study. After induction of anesthesia, the left or right femoral artery was accessed using standard techniques and an arterial sheath was introduced and advanced into the artery.<br>
[0164] Vessel angiography was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, a 7 Fr. guide catheter was inserted through the sheath and advanced to the appropriate location where intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered. A segment of coronary artery ranging from 2.25 to 4.0 mm mean lumen diameter was chosen and a 0.014" guidewire inserted. Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) was performed to document the reference vessel diameter.<br>
[0165] The appropriately sized stent was advanced to the deployment site. The balloon was inflated at a steady rate to a pressure sufficient to achieve a balloon to artery ratio of 1.30:1.0. Pressure was maintained for approximately 10 seconds. Angiography was performed to document post-procedural vessel patency and diameter.<br>
[0166] Follow-up angiography was performed at the designated endpoint for each of the animals. Each angiogram was qualitatively evaluated for evidence of stent migration, lumen narrowing, stent apposition, presence of dissection or aneurysms, and flow characteristics. Upon completion of follow-up angiography, the animals were euthanized.<br><br>
[0167] The hearts were harvested from each animal and the coronary arteries were perfused with 10% buffered formalin at 100 to 120 mm Hg. The hearts were immersed in 10% buffered formalin. Any myocardial lesions or unusual observations were reported.<br>
[0168] Angiographic parameters measured or calculated included:<br>
■	Marginal vessel (proximal and distal) mean lumen diameter (post-stent and final only)<br>
■	Mean lumen diameter of the target region (all angiograms)<br>
■	Minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of the target region (post-stent and final only)<br>
■	Diameter stenosis [1 - (MLD/RVD)] x 100% where RVD is a calculation of the reference diameter at the position of the obstruction (measure obtained by a software-based iterative linear regression technique to generate an intrapolation of a projected vessel without the lesion) (final angiogram only)<br>
■	Balloon to artery ratio [balloon/pre-stent mean luminal diameter]<br>
■	Stent to artery ratio [post-stent/pre-stent mean luminal diameter]<br>
■	Late loss ratio [MLD final-MLD post-stent]<br>
[0169] All animal survived to the designated end point. There were no documented incidents of stent migration, stent malapposition, persistent dissection or evidence of aneurysm. Three outlying data points (total occlusion or near total occlusion) for the Cypher Stent were excluded. The average percent stenosis for the Compound AR stent (approx. 10 microgram/mm length drug dose) was 25.7 ± 17.8 (n=15) as compared to Cypher Stent pooled data from this and previous studies with similar protocols which provided an average percent stenosis of 20.21 ± 11.45 (n=22) for Cypher stents. (Figure 9).<br>
[0170] The Compound AR eluting stents in this example when implanted in the porcine model for 28 days resulted in higher percentage stenosis as compared to the Cypher Stent.<br>
Example 5: In vivo Pharmacokinetics of Stents Eluting Compound AR<br>
[0171] Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the Compound AR stent system from Example 3 was performed at 6 hours, 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days in the porcine coronary artery model. The interventional procedures used were similar to the in vivo angiographic study described in Example 4 up to stent implantation.<br>
[0172] The appropriately sized stent was advanced to the deployment site. The balloon was inflated at a steady rate to a pressure sufficient to achieve a balloon to artery ratio of 1:1. Pressure was maintained for approximately 10 seconds. Angiography was performed to<br><br>
document post-procedural vessel patency and diameter. A total of 9 stents (3 per time point) were implanted.<br>
[0173J At the appropriate time point the animals were euthanized and the hearts excised. The stented segment including approximately 10mm of vessel proximal and 10mm distal to the stented section was excised. The proximal and distal sections were separated and stored in separate vials. The tissue surrounding the stent was carefully removed from stent and each place in separate vials. All were then frozen to -70 °C prior to being analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS).<br>
[0174] All animal survived to the designated end point. The average tissue concentrations for the Compound AR and stent release rates are presented in Figures 10 and 11. The Compound AR eluting stent, in this example demonstrates release of Compound AR from the stent with greater than 40% of the drug released at 7 days.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocvclic lactone CAS)<br>
[0175] Add 0.8mL 5% NaOH-MeOH and 2ml 30%H2O2 to a solution of 1 gram Rapamycin in 40 ml methanol. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. If TLC indicated some rapamycin was still unreacted, additional mixture of 0.8mL 5% NaOH-MeOH and 2ml 30%H2O2 was added to the reaction solution. Stirring continued at room temperature until TLC indicated the reaction has completed. The solution was extracted with dichloromethane and brine 3 times. The organic layers were combined and washed with brine and water, dried over anhydrous MgS04, filtered MgS04 and the solution was evaporated to leave a raw product. This raw product was further purified using TLC plate and giving 0.40g (40% yields) light yellow powder. 1H NMR (CDC13) (~4:1 mixture of conformers, only signals of major conformer listed) Major changes compared with rapamycin 6 (ppm) 1.75(s, 1H), 1.98(s, 1H), 6.71(ddd, 5H, Jl=16Hz, J2=8Hz, J3=2.8Hz). 13C DEPT 135 NMR (CDCI3) (~4:1 mixture of conformers, only signals of major conformer listed) 8 (ppm) 152, 140, 133, 128, 127, 126, 84, 83, 76, 74, 67, 59, 56, 44, 43, 41, 40, 36, 35, 34, 33, 31, 29, 28, 22, 21, 20, 17, 16, 15, 13. Mass Spectra m/z=962 with Rapamycin m/z=930.<br>
Example 7; Biological Activity of 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocvclic lactone (AS)<br>
[0176] Potency of the 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocyclic lactone was demonstrated by in vitro human smooth muscle cell culture testing. The amounts of incorporated thymidine for samples of 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocyclic lactone of varying concentrations<br><br>
(0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μM) and of Compound AR of varying concentrations (0.0005, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 μM) were measured after exposure for 8 hours. The IC50 of 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocyclic lactone and Compound AR wasapproximately 0.1 and 0.005 uM, respectively, after smooth muscle cells were exposed to 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocyclic lactone and Compound AR for 8 hours ( Figure 13). The IC50 of 17, 18-29, 30-bis-epoxide macrocyclic lactone was approximately 20 times higher than that of Compound AR.<br>
Example 8: Preparation of 17, 18-19, 20-21, 22-tris-epoxide macrocyclic lactone (AY)<br>
[0177] m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid 0.93g ( 3.22 mmol) was added to a solution of 0.50g (0.5371mmol) rapamycin in 10 ml CHCl3 at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. If TLC indicated some rapamycin was still unreacted, additional m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid 0.50g and 5 mL CHCl3 was added. Stirring was continued at room temperature until no Rapamycin was indicated by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the solution was diluted with dichloromethane, treated with aqueous sodium sulfite until the washings give a negative test with starch-iodide paper. This ensures all excess peracid has been destroyed and the aqueous layer was extracted with several portions of CH2Cl2. Then organic layer was washed with two 20ml portion of 5% sodium bicarbonate to remove benzoic acid. The combined organic extracts were washed with water, dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to leave a crude white solid 0.46g. The raw product was further purified using TLC plate. MS m/z 978 with Rapamycin m/z 930.<br>
Example 9: Cytokine Inhibition by Macrocyclic lactone:<br>
[0178] In cell culture studies, macrophages were activated to secrete cytokines such as I1-6, MMP-9, MCP-1 and IL-10 by treating the cells to E Coli lippopolysaccharide (LPS). Inhibition of these cytokines upon treatment of the activated macrophages with Compound AR and rapamycin with 10nM concentration was tested using ELISA assay. The inhibition of pro-inflammatory and cell proliferation and migration inducing cytokines upon exposure to the macrocyclic lactone is presented in Figure 12(a). The inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 upon exposure to macrocyclic lactone Compound AR and Sirolimus are presented in Figure 12(b).<br>
[0179] MMP-9 levels in the 1 st, 3rd and 7th day after stent implantation were positively correlated to the late loss index 6 months after stent implantation (Elevated matrix<br><br>
metalloproteinase expression after stent implantation is associated with restenosis. Int J Cardiol. 2006; 112(l):85-90).<br>
[0180] Compound AR and Sirolimus did not show and significant inhibition of release of IL-6. Compound AR significantly reduced the production of both the cytokines MMP-9 and MCP-1 as compared to Sirolimus which increased the production of MMP-9 and did not impact the production of MCP-1.<br>
[0181] Compound AR and Sirolimus did not show any difference in inhibition of release of IL-6. On the other hand, Compound AR reduced the production of cytokine MMP-9 while Sirolimus increased the production of MMP-9. Compound AR reduced the production of cytokine MCP-1 as compared to Sirolimus which did not impact the production of MCP-1. Compound AR and Sirolimus both inhibit the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.<br>
[0182] Compounds claimed in the present invention, such as Compound AR can provide better therapeutic response with higher levels of anti-inflammatory effect (such as greater inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine MCP-1) and higher levels of anti-cell proliferative and anti-cell migratory effect (such as greater inhibition of pro-proliferative and migration cytokine MMP-9).<br>
Example 10; Testing of Compound AR eluting Stents in Human Clinical Trial:<br>
[0183] Clinical testing of the Compound AR coated stent was conducted on 15 human subjects. Safety of the Compound AR coated stent was evaluated clinically through the evaluation of major adverse cardiac events defined as: death, myocardial infarction (both Q-wave and non-Q-wave), and target lesion revascularization. Efficacy was evaluated through angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (WHS) results at 4 months. The primary endpoint of the study was angiographic in-stent late lumen loss. Secondary endpoints were Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) and additional angiographic and IVUS evaluation. The clinical study was approved by local Ethics Committee and all patients signed an Ethics approved informed consent before entry into the clinical study.<br>
[0184] All patients were pretreated with aspirin and ticlopidine (500mg) per oral beginning at least 1 day prior or on the day of the index procedure. Aspirin (&gt;100mg/day and<br><br>
Clopidogrel (75mg/day) were continued through for at least six months. In accordance with hospital standard percutaneous practice, the left or right femoral artery was accessed using standard techniques and an arterial sheath was introduced and advanced into the artery.<br>
[0185] Index procedure vessel angiography was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, a 6 or 7 Fr. guide catheter was inserted through the sheath and advanced to the appropriate location; intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered. A segment of coronary artery ranging from 3.0mm to 3.5 mm mean lumen diameter was chosen and a 0.014" guidewire inserted. Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) was performed to document the reference vessel diameter. Predilatation of the lesion was performed prior to stent implantation using standard technique.<br>
[0186] Following predilatation, the appropriately sized stent (3.0 x 18 mm or 3.5 x 18 mm was advanced to the deployment site. The balloon was inflated at a steady rate to a pressure to fully deploy the stent. Pressure was maintained for approximately 30 seconds. Post dilatation of the stent could be performed as needed to assure good stent apposition to the vessel wall. Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS) was performed and recorded.<br>
[0187] Follow-up angiography and IVUS was performed at the designated endpoint of 4 months for each patient. Each angiogram was qualitatively evaluated for evidence of lumen narrowing, stent apposition, and flow characteristics.<br>
[0188] Angiographic and IVUS parameters measured or calculated included:<br>
■	Marginal vessel (proximal and distal) mean lumen diameter (post-stent and final)<br>
■	Mean lumen diameter of the target region (all angiograms)<br>
■	Minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of the target region (post-stent and final only)<br>
■	Diameter stenosis [1 - (MLD/RVD)] x 100%] where RVD is a calculation of the reference diameter at the position of the obstruction (measure obtained by a software-based iterative linear regression technique to generate an intrapolation of a projected vessel without the lesion) (final angiogram only).<br>
■	In-stent Late Lumen Loss [MLD final-MLD post-stent]<br>
■	In-stent percent neointimal volume as assessed by IVUS<br>
[0189] All patients underwent 4 month clinical and angiographic follow-up. No patients experience any major adverse cardiac events during the follow-up period. Angiographic<br><br>
results demonstrated that the primary endpoint of angiographic in-stent late lumen loss was 0.16 ± 0.32 mm. IVUS analysis was conducted on 13 of 15 patients and the results demonstrated in-stent percent neointimal volume of 3.7 ± 2.7%.<br>
[0190] As a comparison, Cypher stent tested in a pilot study and demonstrated similar clinical safety with no clinical events and angiographic results at 4 months of in-stent late lumen loss for the slow release group (the current commercially available formulation) of 0.09 ± 0.3 mm and instent percent neiontimal volume by IVUS to be 0.3 ±0.6 % (Sousa, JE, Circulation 2001; 103; 192-195).<br>
