Operating method for a reversing rolling mill<br>
The present invention relates to an operating method for a<br>
reversing rolling mill that has at least one reversing stand<br>
for rolling a rolling material, two roller tables, arranged on<br>
both sides of the reversing stand, for conveying the rolling<br>
material, and a control device for controlling the reversing<br>
rolling mill,<br>
the roller tables respectively having a number of roller<br>
table areas of which each has at least one conveyor<br>
roller,<br>
it being possible to drive the conveyor rollers of each<br>
roller table area independently of the conveyor rollers of<br>
the other roller table area,<br>
the rolling material being conveyed in such a way that a<br>
fore end of the rolling material is conveyed at an entry<br>
speed, and a rear end of the rolling material is conveyed<br>
at an exit speed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a data medium<br>
having a computer program, stored on the data medium, for<br>
carrying out such an operating method when the computer program<br>
is executed by a control device for a reversing rolling mill.<br>
The present invention also relates to a control device for a<br>
reversing rolling mill which is designed, in particular<br>
programmed, in such a way that the reversing rolling mill can<br>
be driven by it in accordance with such an operating method.<br>
The present invention further relates to a reversing rolling<br>
mill and to a rolling material produced in accordance with the<br>
inventive operating method.<br>
Operating methods, data media, control devices, reversing<br>
rolling mills and rolling materials of the type mentioned at<br>
the beginning are generally known.<br><br>
In so-called continuous trains rolling material - in particular<br>
strip-shaped - is always conveyed in the same direction on its<br>
roller tables. As a rule, even the conveying speed at which the<br>
rolling material is transported is at least substantially<br>
constant. It is therefore possible in a relatively simple way<br>
to drive the roller tables in such a way that the<br>
circumferential speeds of the conveyor rollers correspond to<br>
the conveying speed of the rolling material.<br>
In reversing stands, by contrast, the rolling material<br>
traverses one and the same rolling stand several times<br>
consecutively, the rolling direction alternating in each case.<br>
The rolling material must therefore always be repeatedly<br>
accelerated and braked. For the same reason, it is also<br>
necessary for the conveyor rollers to be repeatedly accelerated<br>
and braked. Nevertheless, the circumferential speeds of the<br>
conveyor rollers should as far as possible correspond to the<br>
conveying speed of the rolling material. The point is that<br>
relative movements between rolling material and conveyor<br>
rollers impair the quality of the rolling material surface, and<br>
furthermore load the drives of the conveyor rollers.<br>
In order to ensure the synchronous running of the conveyor<br>
rollers of the roller table areas and of the rolling material,<br>
it is known in the prior art for the conveyor rollers or all<br>
roller table areas that can come into contact with the rolling<br>
material to be accelerated and braked with the rolling<br>
material. This results in processes of acceleration and braking<br>
that, firstly, are partly not even necessary and therefore load<br>
the drives unnecessarily and, secondly, can above all occur<br>
simultaneously and therefore lead to undesired network<br>
feedback. Unnecessary energy is, furthermore, frequently<br>
consumed.<br>
In order to avoid the abovenamed disadvantages, it is,<br>
furthermore, known in the prior art that the control device<br><br>
determines a time at which the rolling material enters the<br>
respective roller table area and, from this time, accelerates<br>
the conveyor rollers of the directly adjacent roller table area<br>
into which the rolling material next enters. Unnecessary<br><br>
acceleration processes and undesired network feedback can<br>
largely be avoided by means of this mode of procedure. However,<br>
it is no longer ensured that the conveyor rollers of the<br>
directly adjacent roller table area have already reached the<br>
conveying speed when the rolling material enters this directly<br>
adjacent roller table area.<br>
The object of the present invention consists in providing an<br>
operating method for a reversing rolling ir.ill by means of which<br>
it is possible, on the one hand, to avoid unnecessary<br>
acceleration processes and distribute required acceleration<br>
processes over time, and on the other hand to ensure that the<br>
circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers is adapted to the<br>
conveying speed of the rolling material when the rolling<br>
material enters the respective roller table area.<br>
The object is achieved in the case of an operating method of<br>
the type mentioned at the beginning by virtue of the fact that,<br>
at least for each roller table area arranged on the exit side<br>
with reference to the respective conveying operation with<br>
reference to the reversing stand, the control device<br>
individually calculates a entry time at which the rolling<br>
material enters at the earliest into the respective roller<br>
table area, and whose conveyor rollers are driven in such a way<br>
that the circumferential speed is adjusted to the entry speed<br>
at the latest at the entry time..<br>
In a fashion corresponding to this, the object for the data<br>
medium is achieved by virtue of the fact that stored on it is a<br>
computer program, which acts to carry out such an operating<br>
method when the computer program is executed by a control<br>
device for a reversing rolling mill.<br>
Furthermore, the object is also achieved by a control device<br>
for a reversing rolling mill which is designed, in particular<br><br>
programmed, in such a way that the reversing rolling mill can<br>
be driven by it in accordance with such an operating method.<br><br>
Furthermore, the object is achieved by means of a reversing<br>
rolling mill that is provided with such a control device.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the control device<br>
thus uses data prescribed for it and relating, in particular,<br>
to the speed profile for the rolling material on the entry side<br>
and on the exit side - referred to the respective conveying<br>
operation and the reversing stand - to the strip length and the<br>
instantaneous position of the fore end of the rolling material<br>
to calculate the time at which the rolling material reaches the<br>
respective roller table area at the earliest, and which entry<br>
speed the fore end of the rolling material has at this time.<br>
The control device can therefore use the instantaneous<br>
circumferential speeds of the conveyor rollers of the roller<br>
table areas, and the maximum possible accelerations of the<br>
conveyor rollers of the relevant roller table areas to count<br>
back to when it is necessary to begin to adapt the<br>
circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers of the respective<br>
roller table area. The start time for adapting the<br>
circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers to the entry<br>
speed - dependent on speed, if appropriate - can therefore be<br>
determined in an ordinary way in advance.<br>
As a rule, the rolling material is rolled in the reversing<br>
stand. In this case, during the rolling process the entry speed<br>
(= speed of the fore end of the rolling material) and the exit<br>
speed (= speed of the rear end of the rolling material) are, of<br>
course, different from one another. Furthermore, they are also<br>
different as a rule from a circumferential speed of work rolls<br>
of the reversing stand. However, the present invention is<br>
intended also to include the special case that the rolling<br>
material is simply conveyed, and thus that the rolling material<br>
is not worked during the conveyance.<br>
When a start is made in conveying the rolling material, it is<br>
possible that the remaining time no longer suffices to<br><br>
accelerate the conveyor rollers up to the entry speed of one of<br>
the roller table areas near the reversing stand and arranged on<br>
the exit side with reference to the respective conveying<br>
operation<br><br>
with reference to the reversing stand. In order also to ensure<br>
in this case that the conveyor rollers of the relevant roller<br>
table area are accelerated up to the entry speed, it is<br>
provided that before the conveyance of the rolling material the<br>
control device determines for at least one of the roller table<br>
areas arranged on the exit side with reference to the<br>
respective conveying operation with reference to the reversing<br>
stand a minimum time period that is required in order to adjust<br>
the circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers of the<br>
relevant roller table area to the entry speed, and delays the<br>
beginning of the conveyance of the rolling material and<br>
approximates the circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers<br>
of the relevant roller table area to the entry speed as long as<br>
the minimum time period is greater than a conveyance period<br>
that corresponds to the difference between the entry time and<br>
the beginning of the conveyance of the rolling material.<br>
This last-described mode of procedure is particularly sensible<br>
for the roller table area that directly adjoins the reversing<br>
stand on the exit side with reference to the respective<br>
conveying operation with reference to the reversing stand.<br>
At least for each roller table area arranged on the exit side<br>
with reference to the respective conveying operation with<br>
reference to the reversing stand, the control device preferably<br>
controls the adjustment of the circumferential speed of the<br>
conveyor rollers of the respective roller table area to the<br>
entry speed in accordance with an acceleration profile that is<br>
individual for the respective roller table area, the<br>
acceleration profile being determined in such a way that a<br>
control margin remains. The point is that it is then possible<br>
to correct unforeseen changes in the entry speed. The control<br>
margin is realized in the case of a given maximum acceleration<br>
by virtue of the fact that the time period for adjusting the<br>
circumferential speed to the entry speed is determined as being<br>
greater than the abovementioned minimum time period.<br><br>
The abovedescribed mode of procedure can be adopted not only on<br>
the exit side, but also on the entry side as long as the fore<br>
end of the rolling material has thus not yet reached the<br>
reversing stand. In these cases, instead of the entry speed it<br>
is possible to use the exit speed, that is to say the speed at<br>
which the rear end of the rolling material is moving. The point<br>
is that as long as the fore end of the rolling material has not<br>
yet reached the reversing stand, the entry speed and the exit<br>
speed are identical.<br>
In an analogous way to the driving of the roller table areas<br>
when the rolling material enters into the respective roller<br>
table area, a similar driving of the roller table areas can be<br>
sensible even during the exiting of the rear end of the rolling<br>
material from a rolling table area - at least on the entry side<br>
of the reversing stand. In this case, at least for each roller<br>
table area arranged on the entry side with reference to the<br>
respective conveying operation with reference to the reversing<br>
stand, the control device individually calculates an exit time<br>
at which the rolling material exits at the latest into the<br>
respective roller table area, and whose conveyor rollers are<br>
driven in such a way that the circumferential speed is lowered<br>
to less than the exit speed at the earliest at the exit time.<br>
The time at which a start is made with lowering the<br>
circumferential speed should preferably lie ahead of the time<br>
at which the rear end of the rolling material exits from the<br>
roller table area directly adjoining in the direction of the<br>
reversing stand.<br>
The control device must compute the entry time in the course of<br>
the timely acceleration of the conveyor rollers before the<br>
rolling material enters into the respective roller table area.<br>
The same mode of procedure is possible in the course of the<br>
lowering of the circumferential speed of the conveyor rollers<br>
after the rolling material exits from the respective roller<br>
table area. It is also possible here as an alternative to<br><br><br>
202detect mechanically when the rolling material exits, for<br>
example by means of the loading of the drives of the relevant<br>
conveyor rollers.<br><br>
Further advantages and details emerge from the following<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment in conjunction with the<br>
drawings, in which, in a schematic representation:<br>
figure 1 shows a reversing rolling mill, and<br>
figures 2 to 5 show flowcharts..<br>
In accordance with figure 1, a reversing rolling mill has a<br>
reversing stand 1, two roller tables 2, 3 arranged on both<br>
sides of the reversing stand 1, and a control device 4. The<br>
reversing stand 1 serves for the reversing rolling of a rolling<br>
material 5, in particular a strip-shaped rolling material 5.<br>
The roller tables 2, 3 serve for conveying the rolling material<br>
5. The control device 4 effects the control of the reversing<br>
rolling mill, that is to say of the reversing stand 1 and the<br>
roller tables 2, 3, in particular.<br>
The roller tables 2, 3 respectively have a number of roller<br>
table areas 6. Each roller table area 6 has at least one<br>
conveyor roller 7. The conveyor roller 7 of each roller table<br>
area 6 can be driven by the control device 4 independently of<br>
the conveyor rollers 7 of the other roller table areas 6. In<br>
particular, the conveyor rollers 7 of each roller table area 6<br>
are'respectively assigned at least one dedicated drive 8.<br>
The first step in implementing the present invention is to<br>
write a computer program 9 for the control device 4. This<br>
computer program 9 is stored in an (exclusively) machine<br>
readable form on a data medium 10. The data medium 10 can be,<br>
for example, an internal data medium of the control device 4 or<br>
another computer, not illustrated for reasons of clarity.<br>
However, the data medium 10 can also be a transportable data<br>
medium 10 such as, for example, a CD-ROM 10, a memory card or a<br>
USB memory stick.<br><br>
The computer program 9 is loaded into the control device 4 and<br>
stored there, for example on the hard disk thereof. If the<br>
computer program 9 is called up on the basis of<br><br>
corresponding call conditions (for example a user input), the<br>
control device 4 drives the reversing rolling mill in<br>
accordance with an operating method that is explained in more<br>
detail below in conjunction with figures 2 to 5. Storing the<br>
computer program 9 in the control device 4 thus means that the<br>
latter is appropriately programmed or of more general design.<br>
In accordance with figure 2, the control device 4 receives<br>
various parameters in a step Si. Thus, in step SI the control<br>
device 4 firstly receives an initial position pA. The initial<br>
position pA characterizes the position pA of a fore end 11 of<br>
the rolling material 5 at the instantaneous time t.<br>
Furthermore, the control device 4 also receives a corresponding<br>
final position pE of a rear end 12 of the rolling material 5 at<br>
the instantaneous time t. Furthermore, the control device 4<br>
receives a conveying speed vT of the rolling material 5. The<br>
conveying speed vT specifies the speed at which the rolling<br>
material 5 is to be fed to the reversing stand 1. Finally, the<br>
control device 4 receives stand settings of the reversing<br>
stand 1.<br>
The step SI is executed at a time at which the fore end 11 of<br>
the rolling material has not yet reached the reversing stand 1.<br>
It is therefore possible in the course of a step S2 for the<br>
control device 4 to undertake the following determinations:<br>
Firstly with the aid of the initial position pA and of the<br>
conveying speed vT it can determine a time at which the<br>
fore end 11 of the rolling material enters into the<br>
reversing stand 1. Before this time, the entry speed vE at<br>
which the fore end 11 of the rolling material enters into<br>
the roller table areas 6 arranged on the entry side is<br>
equal to the conveying speed vT. Starting from this time,<br>
the entry speed vE at which the fore end 11 of the rolling<br>
material enters into the roller table area 6 on the exit<br><br>
side is determined by the quotient of the conveying speed<br>
vT and a relative pass reduction h.<br><br>
In a similar way, the control device 4 uses the final<br>
position pE and the conveying speed vT to determine the<br>
time at which the rear end 12 of the rolling material<br>
enters into the reversing stand 1. Before this time, an<br>
exit speed vA at which the rear end 12 of the rolling<br>
material exits from the roller table area 6 on the entry<br>
side is equal to the conveying speed vT. After this time,<br>
the exit speed vA at which the rear end 12 of the roller<br>
material exits from the roller table areas 6 arranged on<br>
the exit side is determined by the quotient of conveying<br>
speed vT and relative pass reduction h.<br>
The terms "entry speed" and "exit speed" thus denote in the<br>
scope of the present invention the speeds at which the fore end<br>
11 of the rolling material enters into the roller table areas 6<br>
and, respectively at which the rear end 12 of the rolling<br>
material exits from the roller table areas 6. They are thus<br>
used differently than normal.<br>
The relative pass reduction 8h can be explicitly determined by<br>
the Stand parameters. However, it is also possible for the<br>
control device 4 itself to determine the relative pass<br>
reduction 8h with the aid of the stand settings.<br>
As a result, in step S2 the control device 4 thus determines<br>
the time profiles both of the entry speed vE and of the exit<br>
speed vA. It is therefore capable of determining in advance the<br>
position at which the fore end 11 of the rolling material and<br>
the rear end 12 of the rolling material, are located at any<br>
desired time t.<br>
In a step S3, the control device firstly selects that one of<br>
the roller table areas 6 which directly adjoins the reversing<br>
stand 1 on the exit side. It therefore selects the roller table<br>
area 6 into which the rolling material 5 firstly enters after<br>
being rolled by the reversing stand 1. In a step S4, it<br><br>
undertakes the required adaptations of the rotation speed vU of<br>
the conveyor roller 7 of the selected<br><br>
roller table area 6. The step S4 is explained in more detail in<br>
conjunction with figure 3.<br>
In a step S5, the control device 4 then checks whether it has<br>
already carried out the step S4 for all roller table areas 6<br>
arranged on the exit side. If this is not the case, the control<br>
device 4 selects in a step S6 the next roller table area 6 on<br>
the exit side, and returns to the step S4.<br>
In steps S7 to S10, the control device 4 carries out a mode of<br>
procedure, corresponding to the steps S3 to S6, with reference<br>
to the roller table areas 6 arranged on the entry side. Here,<br>
as well, the step S8 is explained in more detail in conjunction<br>
with figure 4.<br>
In a step S11, the control device 4 checks whether the<br>
conveyance of the rolling material 5 has ceased, and thus<br>
whether the respective conveying operation has ceased. If this<br>
is not the case, the control device 4 returns to the step S3.<br>
Otherwise, the control device 4 checks in a step S12 whether<br>
all the conveying operations (in particular all the rolling<br>
passes to be executed) have already been executed. If this is<br>
not the case, the control device 4 returns to the step SI.<br>
Otherwise, the inventive operating method has ceased.<br>
The control device 4 preferably proceeds as follows in<br>
accordance with figure 3 in order to implement the step S4 of<br>
figure 2:<br>
Firstly, with the aid of the initial position pA and the entry<br>
speed profile vE(t), it determines in a step S21 an entry time<br>
TE for the selected roller table area 6. Furthermore, with the<br>
aid of the final position pE and the exit speed profile vA(t),<br>
it determines (likewise in the course of the step S21) exit<br>
times TA and TA' for the selected roller table area 6 and for<br>
the roller table area 6<br><br>
that adjoins the selected roller table area 6 in the direction<br>
of the conveying speed vT.<br>
In a step S22, the control device 4 next determines a start<br>
time TS. The start time TS is preferably determined by the<br>
formula<br><br>
TR is a time that is greater than zero. I": signifies a control<br>
margin. vE(TE) is the entry speed vE at which the fore end 11<br>
of the rolling material enters into the selected roller table<br>
area 6 at. the entry time TE. vU(t) is the circumferential speed<br>
vU of the conveyor rollers 7 of the selected roller table area<br>
6 at the instantaneous time t. a is a maximum acceleration of<br>
the conveyor roller 7 of the selected roller table 6.<br>
Furthermore, in a step S23, the control device 4 calculates a<br>
lowering time TA". The lowering time TA" is preferably<br>
determined by the formula<br><br>
k is a factor that lies between zero and one. It preferably<br>
lies in the vicinity of zero, for example between 0.0 and 0.2.<br>
In a step S24, the control device 4 checks whether the<br>
instantaneous time t has already exceeded the start time TS. If<br>
this is not the case, the control device 4 carries out in a<br>
step S25 a reaction that can be arbitrary within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
By contrast, when the start time TS has been reached or<br>
exceeded, the control device 4 furthermore checks in a step S26<br>
whether the entry time TE has already been exceeded, and thus<br>
whether the rolling material 5 has already reached the selected<br>
roller table area 6. If this is not the case, in a<br><br>
step S27 the control device 4 drives the conveyor rollers 7 in<br>
such a way that the circumferential speed vU thereof<br>
approximates the entry speed vE at the entry time TE. Since<br>
this adjustment in the step S27 is preferably performed with<br>
the maximum acceleration a, it is ensured that the<br>
circumferential speed vU of the conveyor rollers 7 is adjusted<br>
to the entry speed vE at the correct time, that is to say at<br>
the latest at the entry time TE. Moreover,, the time reserve TR<br>
remains as control margin for compensating any unforeseen<br>
changes in the entry speed vE. Furthermore, on the basis of the<br>
individual determination of the start time TS and of the<br>
individual entry speed vE at this time TS, the acceleration<br>
profile in conjunction with which the adjustment of the<br>
circumferential speed vU is performed is also individual to the<br>
respective roller table area 6.<br>
Even though the entry time TE has already been exceeded, the<br>
control device 4 checks in a step S28 whether the lowering time<br>
TA" has already been reached. If this is not the case, the<br>
control device 4 takes the circumferential speed vU of the<br>
conveyor roller 7 of the selected roller table area 6 at the<br>
entry speed vE given at the respective time t. Otherwise, in a<br>
step S30 it lowers the circumferential speed vU of the conveyor<br>
roller 7 of the selected roller table area 6.<br>
The reference speed for the circumferential speed vU is the<br>
entry speed vE in the step S29, while it is exit speed vA in<br>
the step S30. The contradiction between the steps S29 and S30<br>
is, however, only apparent. The point is that the rolling<br>
material 5 has already been completely rolled at the lowering<br>
time TA". Consequently, both the fore end 11 of the rolling<br>
material and the rear end 12 of the rolling material are<br>
located on the exit side of the reversing stand 1. For this<br>
reason, after the lowering time TA" the exit speed vA is equal<br>
to the entry speed vE.<br><br>
The implementation of the step S8 of figure 2 that is<br>
illustrated in figure 4 corresponds very largely to figure 3.<br>
The sole difference resides in that instead of the step S29, in<br>
figure 4 a step S31 is executed in which the circumferential<br>
speed vU is kept at the exit speed vA. Here, as well, the<br>
contradiction with the step S27 is only an apparent one. The<br>
point is that owing to the circumstance that in the context of<br>
figure 4 the selected roller table area 6 is located on the<br>
entry side, the entry speed vE is equal to the exit speed vA<br>
when the fore end 11 of the rolling material enters into the<br>
selected roller table area 6.<br>
In accordance with figures 2 to 4, both the adjustment of the<br>
circumferential speed vU to the entry speed vE, and the<br>
lowering of the circumferential speed vU below the exit speed<br>
vA are executed for the conveyor rollers 7 of all the roller<br>
table areas 6, that is to say both on the entry side and on the<br>
exit side. However, it is possible to execute the inventive<br>
method only on the exit side. In this case, the steps S7 to 10,<br>
and also figure 4, can be omitted.<br>
Independently of whether the inventive operating method is<br>
executed only on the exit side or else on the entry side, it is<br>
possible, furthermore, to undertake only the adjustment of the<br>
circumferential speed vU to the entry speed vE, but no longer<br>
to undertake the lowering of the circumferential speed vU after<br>
the exit time TA. In this case, the steps S23, S28 and S30 can<br>
be omitted in figures 3 and 4. Thus, in this case there is<br>
always a transition directly to the step S29 from the step S26.<br>
Furthermore, in this case the determination of the exit times<br>
TA, TA' can be omitted in step S21.<br>
The procedure described so far already yields a substantial<br>
improvement over the prior art. However, the inventive<br>
operating method can be optimized even further using the<br>
refinement in accordance with figure 5.<br><br>
In accordance with figure 5, steps S41 to S46 are inserted<br>
between the steps S2 and S3 of figure 2.<br>
In the step S41, the control device 4 selects - in a similar<br>
way to the step S3 of figure 2 - the roller table area 6 that<br>
lies closest to the reversing stand 1 on the exit side. The<br>
control device 4 determines a conveying time 8t in step S42.<br>
The conveying time 8t corresponds to the time period that<br>
elapses from the beginning of the conveyance of the rolling<br>
material 5 up to the entry time TE of the fore end 11 of the<br>
rolling material into the selected roller table area 6.<br>
The control device 4 determines a minimum time TM in the step<br>
S43 in accordance with the formula<br><br>
The variables used in this formula have all already been<br>
defined.<br>
The control device 4 checks in the step S44 as to whether the<br>
conveying time 8t exceeds the minimum tirr.e TM. If this is not<br>
the case, in the step S45 the control device 4 approximates the<br>
circumferential speed vU of the conveyor roller 7 of the<br>
selected roller table area 6 to the entry speed vE. Otherwise,<br>
it beings the conveyance of the rolling material 5 in the step<br>
S46.<br>
In accordance with figure 5, the beginning of the conveyance of<br>
the rolling material 5 is delayed only as a function of the<br>
data for the roller table area 6 lying closest to the rolling<br>
stand 1 on the exit side. However, it can also be theoretically<br>
possible, of course, also to carry out the steps S41 to S46 for<br>
the other roller table area 6 on the exit side. However, the<br>
mode of procedure in accordance with figure 5 suffices as a<br>
rule.<br><br>
The inventive operating method therefore ensures that all the<br>
conveyor rollers 7 that are in contact<br><br>
with the rolling material 5 always exhibit a circumferential<br>
speed vU that corresponds to the conveying speed of the rolling<br>
material 5 in the relevant roller table area 6.<br><br>
