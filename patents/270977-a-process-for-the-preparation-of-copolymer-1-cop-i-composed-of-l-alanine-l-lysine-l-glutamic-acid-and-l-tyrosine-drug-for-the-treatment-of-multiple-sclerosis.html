				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of Copolymer -1 (Cop I), composed of L-alanine, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid and L-tyrosine for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Copolymer-1 is a synthetic peptide analog of myelin basic protein (MBP), which is a natural component of myelin sheath. It is a non-autoantigen, which suppresses experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by various encephalitogens including mouse spinal cord homogenate, which includes all myelin antigens such as myelin basic protein. Copolymer- 1 has been demonstrated to be active when injected subcutaneously, intra-peritoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly. It is known that Copolymer-1 is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 3849550 wherein they claim a process wherein the N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA) of tyrosine, alanine, y-benzyl glutamate and N- trifluoro-acetyl lysine are polymerized at ambient temperature in anhydrous dioxane with diethylamine as initiator.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 5800808 wherein they claim a method of manufacturing copolymer-1, comprising reacting protected copolymer-1 with hydrobromic acid to form trifluoroacetyl copolymer-1, treating said trifluoroacetyl copolymer-1 with aqueous piperidine solution to form copolymer-1, and purifying said copolymer-1, to result in copolymer-1 having a molecular weight of about 5 to 9 kilodaltons.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent 5981589 wherein they claim a process for the manufacture of copolymer-I, comprising reacting protected copolymer-I with hydrobromic acid to form trifluoroacetyl copolymer-I, treating the said trifluoroacetyl copolymer-I with aqueous piperidine solution to form copolymer-I and purifying said<br>
copolymer-1, to result in copolymer-1 having a molecular weight of about 5 to 9 kilodaltons.The method involves use of non- supported diethylamine as initiator.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 3849550 wherein they claim a process for the preparation of a polypeptide-I composed of the following amino acid units in the structure namely: L-alanine, L- glutamic acid, L-lysine and L-tyrosine randomly arranged in the polypeptide comprising polymerization of a mixture of the N-carboxyanhydrides of L-alanine, L-tyrosine, a protected L-glutamate and a protected L-lysine to obtain protected copolymer-6 or salts thereof.<br>
But the prior art documents do not present a process for the synthesis of co-polymer-I with control over specific molecular weight range. Further, in the prior art processes it is observed that when polymers are isolated from amine-initiated polymerization reaction mixtures and carefully freed from unreacted anhydrides, they have residual levels of acid groups titratable by sodium methoxide in various anhydrous solvents, as cited in sela et al in J. Am. Chem. Soc. April 5, 1955, volume 77, page 1893-1898. Also, US patent 6620847 has shown in example 2 that when the % of high molecular weight of co-polymer-1 species is less than 2.5%, the % release of serotonin, indicative of toxicity is low, and vice-versa. Further in the same example the inventors have specified that the copolymer with average molecular weight of 22 KDa was designated toxic.<br>
Thus there exists a need in the art to have a process for the synthesis of co-polymer 1 wherein the molecular weight of co-polymer is controlled below 22 KDa, preferably below 20 KDa to overcome toxicity related issues. Also, the process should result in the co-polymer 1 product without the residual levels of acids. Further the process should be simple and efficient, using commonly available chemicals and result in the product directly, with a high degree of purity, not requiring any more steps to for separation, purification, fractionation of various molecular weight ranges and such like.<br>
Novelty of the present invention lies in the process of preparation of Copolymer-I using polymer bound catalyst as initiator. The Copolymer-I obtained in the present invention has acid content of less thanl%.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of co-polymer 1 useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis that result in co-polymer 1 with control over molecular weight below 20 KDa.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of copolymer 1 that results in co-polymer 1 with control over molecular weight below 20 KDa using chemicals that are generally available.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of copolymer 1 useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis that result in co-polymer 1 with control over molecular weight below 20 KDa, wherein the co-polymer has no residues of acids.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING<br>
In figure 1, elution volume (in µL) is plotted against refractive index (in au) to show that the molecular weight of the copolymer-1 synthesized by the process of the invention is between 8-19KDa.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the process of the invention to synthesize copolymer-1, the inventors tried with dialkyl amine initiators for the polymerization of NCAs of tyrosine, alanine, glutamate and lysine. It was surprisingly found that when the initiators are supported, the process resulted in copolymer-1 in the molecular range below 20 KDa, preferably in the range of 8 to 19 KDa.<br>
The polymer supports were used consisting both aromatic and aliphatic monomers and comonomers, which are illustrated below:<br>
1)	Styrene-butadiene<br>
2)	Styrene-ethylene copolymer<br>
3)	Styrene-propylene copolymer<br>
4)	Styrene-d-methyl styrene<br>
5)	p-styryl diphenylphosphine copolymer catalyst support<br>
6)	Laurulated polyethyleneimine<br>
Several types of macro porous styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer (SDVB) were synthesized and selected as support materials. These materials were prepared by general procedures such as suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization and inverse emulsion polymerization published by the authors.1'2 SDVB was synthesized to get a porous structure. Toluene was used as a good solvent, and n-heptane or methyl methacrylate or 2-ethyl-l-hexnol as a poor solvent. The specific surface area and pore volume could be controlled by rates of monomer to solvent. This polymer support has a form of various sizes such as powdery samples, spherical, oval and cylindrical pellet etc.<br>
The prepared supported catalyst is thermally stable upto 400 to 600°C. The physical properties of polymer supports such as BET surface area pore volume and pore size<br>
distribution etc. were measured by physical adsorption of N2 gas at liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K.using autosorb-6 (Quantachrom, USA). BET surface area various<br>
from 50 to 1000 m2/g, micro porous area ~ 25 to 200 m2/g, mesoporous area ~ 100 to 300<br>
m /g, micro pore volume ranging from 0.0001 to 0.5 c.c./ g, and average pore radius starting from 10 A0 to 70 A0.<br>
The amines such as primary, secondary, tertiary amines (straight chain) were linked to SDVB polymer support by chemical reaction forming covalent bonds with amines. Similary branched amines of all three types (mentioned above) were attached to polymer support using chemical reactions. The above amines were also adsorbed on the surface of polymer supports and used.<br>
The process of the invention comprises:<br>
a.	Dissolving N-carboxyanhydrides of tyrosine, alanine, y- benzyl glutamate and<br>
N -trifluoroacetyllysine in a solvent;<br>
b.	Polymerizing the NCA by initialization with supported dialkylamine and stirring<br>
at room temperature;<br>
c.	Pouring the copolymer 1 formed into water, filtering the product and washing<br>
with water and drying;<br>
d.	Suspending in acetic acid, adding HBr in acetic acid, stirring at room temperature,<br>
decanting and evaporating;<br>
e.	Dispersing in water, adding  1  M piperdine, stirring for 24 hours at room<br>
temperature;<br>
f.	Dialyzing at room temperature to achieve pH; 8<br>
g.	Dialyzing against acid followed by water to achieve pH 5.5-6 and<br>
h.   Lyophilizing solution to dryness.<br>

The dialkyl  amine  initiators of the invention are  selected from dimethylamine,<br>
diethylamine, diisopropylamine and such like, alone or in combinations thereof.<br>
The initiator is a combination of dialkylamins and trialkylamines which are supported<br>
or bound on polymers.<br>
The solvents for dissolving NCA are selected from dimethyl formamide, dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, dichloro methane, dioxane, alone or in combinations thereof. The NCA are<br>
dissolved in the solvent at temperatures ranging from 0-80 ° C.<br>
The molecular weight of the copolymer-1 of the invention is as shown in figure 1. The molecular weight is less than 20 KDa varying between 8 and 19 KDa. The graph in figure 1 indicates that % of copolymer-1 below 2KDa to be 0.25% and % over 40 KDa to be 0.55%. The % of species in the range of 8-19KDa is 99.25%. Since the range of copolymer-1 above 20KDa is below is less than 1%, the copolymer-1 is non-toxic as exemplified in example II in US 6620847 to Konfino et al.<br>
