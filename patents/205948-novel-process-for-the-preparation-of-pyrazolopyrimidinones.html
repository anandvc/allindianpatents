The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
This invention relates to a novel process for the production' of 4-al^lpiperazinylsulfonylphenyl- and 4-alkylpiperazinylsulfonyl pyriduiyl-dmydropysazolo[4,3-d]pyrimridin-7-one derivatives, and, in particular, the anti-ixnpotejnce drug, sildenafil and analogues thereof.<br>

Multi-step syntheses for the preparation of sildenafil are described in EP 463 756. Ah. improved process for its production is described in a later application jIEuropean patent application EP 812 845), the fmal step of which involves an internal cyclisation under basic, neutral or acidic conditions.<br><br>
We have now found that sildenafil and analogues thereof may be made via a novel process, as described hereinafter, which process has advantages over the processes described in the above-mentioned prior art documents.<br>

lower   alkyl,   OR5,   C(0)R6,    C(0)OR7,    C(0)NR8R9,   NR10aR10b   and<br>

pyrollidinyl or piperidinyl,<br>
which process comprises the reaction of a compound of formula II,<br><br>
wherein R*is a group substitutable by an aminopyrazole and A, R3 and R4<br>
are as defined above,<br><br>
1	0<br>
wherein R !and R are as defined above,<br>

WO 01/98284<br><br>
PCT/IB01/01050<br><br>
which process is referred to hereinafter as "the process of the invention".<br>
The compcpunds of the general fonnulae I and III may be represented by either of the formulae I, IA and IB or IHA or IEDB in the process according to the present invention.<br><br>
■MA	IIIB<br>
The  term '"aryl",   when  used herein,   includes   six-  to   ten-membered carbocyclici aromatic groups, such as phenyl and naphthyl and the like.<br>
Het groups: may be fully saturated, partly unsaturated, wholly aromatic, partly aromatic and/or bicyclic in character. Het groups that may be mentioned ; include   groups   such   as   optionally   substituted   azetidinyl,<br><br>

The term;"lower alkyl" (which includes the alkyl part of alkylHet and alkylaryl groups), when used herein, includes Q.6 alkyl (e.g. Cw alkyl). Unless otherwise specified, alkyl groups may, when there is a sufficient number ofjicarbon atoms, be linear or branched, be saturated or unsaturated, be cyclic, acyclic or part cyclic/acyclic, and/or be substituted by one or more halo atoms.<br>
As defined herein, the term "halo" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
Compounds of formulae I, IA and IB may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and/or diastereoisomerism. The process of the invention thus also relates to the formation of stereoisomers of compounds of formulae I, IA and IB and mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate, optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation, or by derivatisation, for example with a<br><br>
WO 01/98284'		PCT/TB01/01050<br>
homochiraL acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric esters by conventional means (e.g. HPLC, crystallisation, chromatography over silica<br>
or, for example, via classical resolution with a homochiral acid salt).   The<br>
formation of all stereoisomers is included within the scope of the invention.<br>
Compounds'  of formula H may exhibit tautomerism.     The use of all<br><br>
tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula II is included within the scope of the invention.<br>

By "group subsritutable by an aminopyrazole having structure in" we include any group which, when present in the moiety -C(RX)=NH of a compound of formula II, may undergo displacement by the amino group of 25 an arninop3&gt;razole such that a -C(=NH)-NH- linkage is thereby formed. In accordance with the process of the invention, which the skilled person will appreciate involves a "one-pot" condensation/cyclisation reaction, the aminopyrazole that is reacted with the compound of formula II is a compound of formula HI, HIA or  lllH.     Following the condensation<br><br>

reaction,   the   coupled   intermediate  undergoes   cyclisation   to   form   a compound ojf general formula I.<br>
In this respect, preferred groups that Rx may represent include -NH2, -NHRa, -N(Rb)Rc, -SRd, -SH, -ORe wherein groups Rb to Rc each independentJjy represent the same groups that R as hereinbefore defined may represent (except that they do not represent H or alkoxy) as well as halo (e.g. chloro). Group Ra represents -OR1 or halo (e.g. chloro) wherein R1 is as hereinbefore defined. More preferred values of Rx include -NHRa, -N(Rb)Rc, and preferably -SRd, -SH and -ORc. Particularly preferred values of Rx are Cd alkoxy (e.g. ethoxy).<br>

According tcj a firrther aspect of the invention, there is provided a process<br>
for the production of a compound of formula I, IA or IB, as hereinbefore<br>
defined, which process comprises the reaction of a compound of formula HI,<br>
IUA or IIIH I (as appropriate), as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of<br>
j! formula n, as hereinbefore defined, provided that Rx does not represent<br>
-NH2, or, preferably, Rx does not represent -NH2, -NHRa or -N(Rb)Rc.<br>
The process of the invention may be carried out in the presence of a suitable organic solvent system, which solvent system should not significantly react chemically with, or significantly give rise to stereochemical changes in, the<br>
reactants or product once formed, or significantly give rise to other side<br>
i, reactions.   Preferred solvent systems include aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g.<br>
toluene or xylene) or chlorobenzene. Preferred solvent systems also include<br>
solvents of formula RXH, for example, solvents of formula RcOH (e.g.<br>
ethanol), wherein Rx and Rc are as hereinbefore defined.<br><br>
WO 01/98284	PCT7IB01/01050<br>
In the process of the invention, it may be preferable to add compounds of formulae iin, IHA or IUB to die reaction mixture (prior to carrying out the reaction) in a suitable polar organic solvent such, as ethyl acetate. Such a polar solvent may then be removed before the reaction is initiated.<br>
Hie process of the invention may be carried at elevated temperature (e.g. up to the reflux temperature of the relevant solvent system, or higher if a pressurised system is employed). Clearly, appropriate reaction times and reaction temperatures depend upon the solvent system that is employed, as well as the reactants that are used and the compound that is to be formed, but these may be determined routinely by the skilled person.<br>
We have; found that compounds of formula II may be prepared, advantageously, by way of reaction of a compound of formula IV,<br><br><br>
IV<br><br>
wherein G represents a carboxylic acid group (-C(O)OH) or a derivative thereof, and A, R and R are as hereinbefore defined, with an appropriate reagent for converting the group G to a -C(RX)=NH group, wherein Rx is as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The term "derivative of a carboxylic acid group" when used herein includes groups which are commonly derived from a carboxylic acid and/or groups<br><br>
WO 01/98284	PCT/IB01/01050<br>
that contain a central carbon atom (which carbon atom is attached to the phenyl or pyridyl ring in the compound of formula IV) that is at the same oxidation state as -C(0)OH. The term therefore includes groups such as -CN, -C(ORJ*)3, -C(0)NH2 or -C(=NORf)N(Re)2, wherein Rf represents H or lower alkyhand Re is as hereinbefore defined. G can also represent a 5- or 6-memebered heterocyclic group containing at least two heteioatoms selected from 0, S, N and mixtures thereof wherein said heterocyclic group is bonded bjy a carbon atom, a preferred heterocyclic group, as exemphfied in preparation 4 herein, has the general formula -C(=NORs)N(Re) wherein<br>
the carbon is bonded to both N atoms and wherein Rg is bonded to the N of<br>
i<br>
the -NRe group and wherein Rs is a -CH, or a -CH2- group and wherein Re<br>
Is as defined hereinbefore and is: preferably H or lower alkyl or lower<br>
ilkoxy.  '   :	'<br>
Preferred compounds of formula IV include those in which, when A •epresents GH, then G does not represent -C(0)OH.<br>
Procedures for the conversion of selected groups which G may represent to :ertain -C(RX)=NH groups are known to those skilled in the art, and are lescribed inter alia in: J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Edition, :hapter 10j! 371-374, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1985); and Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations, edited by A.
