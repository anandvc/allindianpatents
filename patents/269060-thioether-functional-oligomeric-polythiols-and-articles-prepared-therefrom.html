PREPARED THEREFROM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/797,985, filed May 5, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to oligomeric polythiols having thioether functionality, and their use in preparing polymers and sulfur-containing polyurethane and poly(ureaurethane) articles having useful optical properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Optical elements that provide acceptable optical qualities while maintaining durability and abrasion resistance are sought for a variety of applications, such as windshields, sunglasses, fashion lenses, nonprescription and prescription lenses, sport masks, face shields and goggles. Responsive to that need, optical elements prepared from a variety of durable organic polymers have been developed.<br>
[0004] A number of organic polymeric materials, such as plastics, have been developed as alternatives and replacements for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies. These polymeric materials can provide advantages relative to glass including shatter resistance, lighter weight for a given application, ease of molding and ease of dyeing. However, the refractive indices of many polymeric materials are lower than that of glass. In ophthalmic applications, the use of a polymeric material having a lower refractive index will require a thicker lens, which is generally undesirable, relative to a material having a higher refractive index.<br>
[0005] Thus, there is a need in the art to develop a polymeric material having an adequate refractive index and good impact resistance/strength for practical use in optical articles, at a reasonable cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF I HE INVENTION The  present  invention   provides  a  thioether-functional,   oligomeric polythiol having pendant hydroxyl functional groups, prepared by reacting together:<br>
(a)	a compound having at least two thiol functional groups; and<br>
(b)	a hydroxyl functional compound having triple bond functionality.<br>
The  present  invention  also  is   directed  to  a  rigid  optical  article comprising a reaction product of:<br>
(A)	a reactive compound comprising a material having functional groups that are reactive with active hydrogens;<br>
(B)	a   thioether-functional,   oligomeric   polythiol   having   pendant hydroxyl functional groups, prepared by reacting together:<br>
(1)	a compound having at least two thiol functional groups;<br>
and<br>
(2)	a   hydroxyl   functional   compound   having   triple   bond<br>
functionality; and optionally<br>
(C)	a compound different from (B) containing active hydrogens.<br>
Also provided is a rigid optical article comprising a reaction product of:<br>
(A)	a reactive compound comprising a material having functional groups that are reactive with active hydrogens;<br>

(C)	a compound different from (B) containing active hydrogens.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0006] It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent.<br>
[0007] For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and other parameters used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. [0008] All numerical ranges herein include all numerical values and ranges of all numerical values within the recited numerical ranges. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. [0009] The various embodiments and examples of the present invention as presented herein are each understood to be non-limiting with respect to the scope of the invention.<br>
[OOIOJ As used in the following description and claims, the following terms have the meanings indicated below:<br>
[0011] The terms "acrylic" and "acrylate" are used interchangeably (unless to do so would alter the intended meaning) and include acrylic acids, anhydrides, and derivatives thereof, such as their C1-C5 alkyl esters, lower alkyl-substituted acrylic acids, e.g., C1-C5 substituted acrylic acids, such as methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, etc., and their C1-C5 alkyl esters, unless clearly indicated otherwise. The terms "(meth)acrylic" or "{meth)acrylate" are<br>
intended to encompass both the acrylic/acrylate and methacrylic/methacrylate forms of the indicated material, e.g., a (meth)acrylate monomer. [0012] The terms "oligomer" and "oligomeric" are intended to refer to compounds prepared by addition polymerization to yield a material having repeating units and having a number average molecular weight up to 5000, or up to 2000, or between 200 and 1200. The number average molecular weight may be determined by gel permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard.<br>
[0013] The term "curable", as used for example in connection with a curable composition, means that the indicated composition is polymerizable or cross-linkable through functional groups, e.g., by means that include, but are not limited to, thermal, catalytic, electron beam, chemical free-radical initiation, and/or photo-initiation such as by exposure to ultraviolet light or other actinic radiation.<br>
[0014] The term "cure", "cured" or similar terms, as used in connection with a cured or curable composition, e.g., a "cured composition" of some specific description, means that at least a portion of the polymerizable and/or crosslinkable components that form the curable composition is polymerized and/or crosslinked. Additionally, curing of a polymerizable composition refers to subjecting said composition to curing conditions such as but not limited to thermal curing, leading to the reaction of the reactive functional groups of the composition, and resulting in polymerization and formation of a polymerizate. When a polymerizable composition is subjected to curing conditions, following polymerization and after reaction of most of the reactive end groups occurs, the rate of reaction of the remaining unreacted reactive end groups becomes progressively slower. The polymerizable composition can be subjected to curing conditions until it is at least partially cured. The term "at least partially cured" means subjecting the polymerizable composition to curing conditions, wherein reaction of at least a portion of the reactive groups of the composition occurs, to form a polymerizate, such that said polymerizate can be demolded, and cut into test pieces, or such that it may be subjected to machining operations, including optical lens processing. The polymerizable composition can also be subjected to curing conditions such that a substantially complete<br>
cure is attained and wherein further curing results in no significant further improvement in polymer properties, such as hardness. [0015] The term "reactive compound" refers to a compound capable of undergoing a chemical reaction with itself and/or other compounds spontaneously or upon the application of heat, actinic radiation, or in the presence of a catalyst or by any other means known to those skilled in the art. [0016] The terms "on", "appended to", "affixed to", "bonded to", "adhered to", or terms of like import mean that the designated item, e.g., a coating, film or layer, is either directly connected to (c. g., superimposed on) the object surface, or indirectly connected to the object surface, e.g., through one or more other coatings, films or layers (superposed on). [0017] The term "ophthalmic" refers to elements and devices that are associated with the eye and vision, such as but not limited to, lenses for eyewear, e.g., corrective and non-corrective lenses, and magnifying lenses. [0018] The term "optical quality", as used for example in connection with polymeric materials, e.g., a "resin of optical quality" or "organic polymeric material of optical quality" means that the indicated material, e.g., a polymeric material, resin, or resin composition, is or forms a substrate, layer, film or coating that can be used as an optical article, such as an ophthalmic lens, or in combination with an optical article.<br>
[0019] The term "rigid", as used for example in connection with an optical substrate or an optical article, means that the specified item is self-supporting; i. e., capable of maintaining its shape and supporting any applied coatings and/or films. The optical substrate itself may be in the form of a film or sheet. A rigid item may also be defined as capable of being demolded and cut into test pieces, or subjected to machining operations, without permanent deformation. Alternatively, a rigid article may be described as having a Martens hardness of at least 20 N/mm2, as defined herein. [0020] The term "optical article" means that the specified article exhibits a visible light transmittance value (transmits incident light) of at least 4 percent, such as at least 50 percent, or at least 70 percent, or at least 85 percent; and exhibits a haze value of less than 5 percent, e.g., less than 1 percent or less than 0.5 percent, when the haze value is measured at 550 nanometers by, for<br>
example, a Haze Gard Plus Instrument. Optical articles can include, but are not limited to, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies, lenses, optical layers, e.g., optical resin layers, optical films, such as films and/or shieets suitable for electronic displays, e.g., monitors, screens, or security elements, optical coatings, and optical substrates having a light influencing property.<br>
[0021] The term "photochromic receptive" means that the indicated item has sufficient free volume to permit photochromic material(s) incorporated within it to transform from its colorless form to its colored form (and then revert to its colorless form) to the degree required for commercial optical applications. [00221 The term "tinted", as used for example in connection with ophthalmic elements and optical substrates, means that the indicated item contains a fixed light radiation absorbing agent, such as but not limited to, conventional coloring dyes and/or pigments, infrared and/or ultraviolet light absorbing materials on or in the indicated item. The tinted item has an absorption spectrum for visible radiation that does not vary significantly in response to actinic radiation.<br>
[0023] The term "non-tinted", as used for example in connection with ophthalmic elements and optical substrates, means that that the indicated item is substantially free of fixed light radiation absorbing agents. The non-tinted item has an absorption spectrum for visible radiation that does not vary significantly in response to actinic radiation.<br>
[0024J The term "radiation curable" refers to compositions that may be cured by means of ionizing radiation such as electron beam, actinic radiation, and the like.<br>
[0025] The term "actinic radiation" includes light with wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation ranging from the ultraviolet ("UV") light range, through the visible light range, and into the infrared range. Actinic radiation which can be used to cure coating compositions used in the present invention generally has wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation ranging from 150 to 2,000 nanometers (nm), from 180 to 1,000 nm, or from 200 to 500 nm. In one embodiment, ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength ranging from 10 to 390 nm can be used. Examples of suitable ultraviolet light sources include xenon<br>
arc lamps, mercury arcs, carbon arcs, low, medium or high pressure mercury lamps, swirl-flow plasma arcs and ultraviolet light emitting diodes. Suitable ultraviolet light-emitting lamps are medium pressure mercury vapor lamps having outputs ranging from 200 to 600 watts per inch (79 to 237 watts per centimeter) across the length ot the lamp tube.<br>
[0026] The term "transparent", as used for example in connection with a substrate, film, material and/or coating, means that the indicated substrate, coating, film and/or material has the property of transmitting light without appreciable scattering so that objects lying beyond are entirely visible. [0027] The present invention is directed to thioether-functionai, oligomeric polythiols having pendant hydroxyl groups. Further, the present invention is directed to compositions comprising thioether-functionai, oligomeric polythiols, including, but not necessarily limited to, those mentioned above having pendant hydroxyl groups. Such compositions can be used to prepare coating compositions and polymerizates employed in the manufacture of articles such as optical articles. Additionally, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of rigid articles such as rigid optical articles comprising thioether-functionai, oligomeric polythiols such as those previously mentioned.<br>
Thioether-functionai. Oligomeric Polythiols Having Pendant Hydroxyl Groups: [0028] As mentioned above, the present invention provides, a thioether-functionai, oligomeric polythiol having pendant hydroxyl functional groups prepared by reacting together:<br>
(a)	a compound having at least two thiol functional groups; and<br>
(b)	a hydroxyl functional compound having triple bond functionality. [0029] The compound (a) having at least two thiol functional groups may comprise a polythiol, i.e., a dithiol, a compound having more than two thiol functional groups (a higher polythiol), or a mixture thereof. Such mixtures may include mixtures of dithiols, mixtures of higher polythiols or mixtures of dithiols and higher polythiols. In an embodiment of the present invention, the compound (a) having at least two thiol functional groups comprises a dithiol, a compound having more than two thiol functional groups, or a mixture of a dithiol and a compound having more than two thiol functional groups. The<br>
thiol functional groups are typically terminal groups, though a minor portion (e.g., less than 50 percent of all groups) may be pendant along a chain. The compound (a) may additionally contain a minor portion of other active hydrogen functionality (i.e., different from thiol), for example, hydroxyl functionality. The compound (a) may be linear or branched, and may contain cyclic, alkyl, aryl, aralkyi, or alkaryl groups.<br>
[0030] The compound (a) can be selected so as to produce a substantially linear oligomeric polythiol. Therefore, when the compound (a) comprises a mixture of a dithiol and a compound having more than two thiol functional groups, the compound having more than two thiol functional groups can be present in an amount up to 10 percent by weight of the mixture. [0031] Suitable dithiols can include linear or branched aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, polymeric, oligomeric dithiols and mixtures thereof. The dithiol can comprise a variety of linkages including but not limited to ether linkages (-0-), sulfide linkages (-S-), polysulfide linkages (-Sx-, wherein x is at least 2, or from 2 to 4), ester linkages, amide linkages and combinations of such linkages.<br>
[0032] Non-limiting examples of suitable dithiols for use in the present invention can include but are not limited to 2,5-dimercaptomethyl-1,4-dithiane, dimercaptodiethylsulfide (DMDS), ethanedithiol, 3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedtthiol, ethylene glycol di(2-mercaptoacetate), ethylene glycol di(3-mercaptopropionate), poly(ethylene glycol) di(2-mercaptoacetate) and poly(ethylene glycol) di(3-mercaptopropionate), benzenedithiol, 4-tert-butyl-1,2-benzenedithiol, 4,4'-thiodibenzenethiol, and mixtures thereof. [0033] The dithiol may include dithiol oligomers having disulfide linkages such as materials represented by the following graphic formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein n can represent an integer from 1 to 21. [0034] Dithioi oligomers represented by Formula I can be prepared, for example, by the reaction of 2,5-dimeracaptomethyl-1,4-dithiane with sulfur in the presence of basic catalyst, as known in the art.<br>
[0035] The nature of the SH group in polythiols is such that oxidative coupling can occur readily, leading to formation of disulfide linkages. Various oxidizing agents can lead to such oxidative coupling. The oxygen in the air can in some cases lead to such oxidative coupling during storage of the polythiol. It is believed that a possible mechanism for the oxidative coupling of thiol groups involves the formation of thiyi radicals, followed by coupling of said thiyi radicals, to form disulfide linkage. It is further believed that formation of disulfide linkage can occur under conditions that can lead to the formation of thiyi radical, including but not limited to reaction conditions involving free radical initiation. The polythiols suitable for use as compound (a) in the preparation of the polythiols of the present invention can include species containing disulfide linkages formed during storage. The polythiols suitable for use as compound (a) in the preparation of any of the oligomeric polythiols of the present invention also can include species containing disulfide linkages formed during synthesis of the polythiol.<br>

[0039] The amount of asym-dichloroacetone and dimercaptan suitable for carrying out the above reaction can vary. For example, asym-dichloroacetone and dimercaptan can be present in the reaction mixture in an amount such that the molar ratio of dichioroacetone to dimercaptan can be from 1:1 to 1:10. [0040] Suitable temperatures for reacting asym-dichloroacetone with dimercaptan can vary, often ranging from 0 to 100°C.

[0044] The amount of dimercaptan, dimercaptoalkylsulfide, or mixtures thereof, suitable for reacting with the reaction product of asym-dichloroacetone and dimercaptan, can vary. Typically, dimercaptan. dimercaptoalkylsulfide, or a mixture thereof, can be present in the reaction mixture in an amount such that the equivalent ratio of reaction product to dimercaptan, dimercaptoalkylsulfide, or a mixture thereof, can be from 1:1.01 to 1:2. Moreover, suitable temperatures for carrying out this reaction can vary within the range of from 0 to 100 °.<br>

The acid catalyst can be selected from a wide variety known in the art, such as but not limited to Lewis acids and Bronsted acids. Non-limiting examples of suitable acid catalysts can include those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, 1992, Volume A21, pp. 673 to 674.

The base can be selected from a wide variety known in the art, such as but not limited to Lewis bases and Bronsted bases. Non-limiting examples of suitable bases can include those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, 1992, Volume A21, pp. 673 to 674. The base is often sodium hydroxide. The amount of base can vary. Typically, a suitable equivalent ratio of base to reaction product of the first reaction can be from 1:1 to 10:1.<br>
[0047] The reaction of asym-dichloroacetone with dimercaptan can be carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be selected from but is not limited to organic solvents. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvents can include but are not limited to chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethyl ether, benzene, toluene, acetic acid and mixtures thereof. [0048] In another embodiment, the reaction product of asym-dichloroacetone and dimercaptan can be reacted with dimercaptoalkylsulfide, dimercaptan or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a solvent, wherein the solvent can be selected from but is not limited to organic solvents. Non-limiting examples of suitable organic solvents can include alcohols such as but not limited to methanol, ethanol and propanol; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as but not limited to benzene, toluene, xylene; ketones such as but not limited to methyl ethyl ketone; water; and mixtures thereof.<br>

[0057] Suitable trifunctional or higher-functional polythiols for use as or in the preparation of compound (a) can be selected from a wide variety known in the art. Non-limiting examples can include pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate), pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), trimethylolpropane tris{2-mercaptoacetate), trimethylolpropane trls{3-mercaptopropionate), and/or thioglycerol bis(2-mercaptoacetate). [0058] For example, the polythiol can be chosen from materials represented by the following formula VIII,<br>

[0059] In particular embodiments, the compound (a) having at least two thiol functional groups may be prepared by reacting together (1) any of the dithiols mentioned above, and (2) a compound having at least two double bonds (for example, a diene). Such compounds having at least two double bonds are described in more detail below, as are reaction methods. [0060] The compound (b) having triple bond functionality, used to prepare the oligomeric polythiols of the present invention, may comprise any alkyne known to those skilled in the art.   In the preparation of the thioether-functional oligomeric polythiols having pendant hydroxyl functional groups, the compound (b) may comprise any hydroxyl functional alkyne known in the art such as those described immediately below. Because a triple bond can react twice with a thiol functional group, for the purposes of the present invention, a triple bond is understood to be equal to two equivalents of a double bond when determining reaction stoichlometry.<br>
[0061] Suitable non-limiting examples of hydroxyl functional compounds having triple bond functionality include propargyl alcohol, 2-butyne-1,4-diol, 3-<br><br>
butyne-2-ol, 3-hexyne-2,5-cliol, and/or mixtures thereof. A portion of the hydroxy] functional groups on the compound (b) may be esterified. For example, a portion of the compound (b) may comprise an alkyne-functional ester of a C1-C12 carboxylic acid such as propargyl acetate, propargyl propionate, propargyl benzoate, and the like. Moreover, in the preparation of the thioether-functional, oligomeric polythiols having pendant hydroxyl groups, a portion of the triple bond-containing compound (b) can comprise, in addition to the hydroxyl functional, triple bond-containing compound, a triple-bond-containing compound which contains no hydroxyl functional groups such as those described hereinbelow.<br>
[0062] In the preparation of the oligomeric polythiol of the present invention, the ratio of thiol functional groups in compound (a) to triple bonds in compound (b) typically ranges from 1.01:1 to 2.0:1, 1.01:1 to 5.0:1, such as 1:3:1 to 2.0:1, and 1.5:1 to 2.0:1. In some instances the presence of an excess of thiol functional groups may be desirable during the reaction as well as in the reaction product as unreacted compound (a). For example, the presence of excess thiol present during the reaction may enhance the reaction rate. Also unreacted thiol, e.g., in the form of unreacted compound (a), can be present in the final reaction product and thus available to subsequently react with, for example, a reactive compound having functional groups reactive with active hydrogens (such as are described below). Thus, in an embodiment of the present invention the reaction ratio of thiol functional groups in the compound (a) to triple bonds in the compound (b) can range from 1.01:1 to 20:1, such as 1.01:1 to 10:1, or 1.01:1 to 5:1, or 1.5:1 to 5:1; or 1.5:1 to 3:1.<br>
[0063] To prepare the oligomeric polythiols of the present invention, the reaction of the compound (a) with triple bond-containing compounds (b) can be carried out in the presence of radical initiator. Suitable radical initiators for use in the present invention can vary widely and can include those known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of radical initiators can include but are not limited to azo or peroxide type free-radical initiators such as azobisalkalenenitriles. The free-radical initiator can be azobisalkalenenitrile which is commercially available from DuPont under the<br>
trade name VAZO™. VAZO-52, VAZO-64, VAZO-67, VAZO-88 and mixtures thereof can also be used as radical initiators. [0064] Selection of the free-radical initiator can depend on reaction temperature. The reaction temperature can vary, for example, from room temperature to 120°C. VAZO 52 can be used at a temperature of from 50-60 °C. VAZO 64 and VAZO 67 can be used at a temperature of 60-100 °C, and VAZO 88 can be used at a temperature of 70-120°C. [0065J The amount of free radical initiator used in the reaction of the present invention can vary widely and can depend on the free radical initiator selected. Typically, the free radical initiator is present in an amount of from 0.01% by weight to 5% by weight of the reaction mixture. [0066] The reaction of the compound (a) with triple bond-containing compounds (b) can be carried out under a variety of reaction conditions. Such conditions can depend on the degree of reactivity of the triple bond containing compound and the desired structure of the resulting polythiol oligomer. In one reaction scheme, the reactants and a radical initiator can be combined together while heating the mixture. Alternatively, triple bond containing-compounds can be added in relatively small amounts over a period of time to a mixture of polythiol and radical initiator at a certain temperature. Also, triple bond containing-compounds can be combined with the compound (a) having at least two thiol functional groups in a stepwise manner under radical initiation. Also, the radical initiator can be dissolved in the triple bond-containing compound (b), and the resulting solution can be added dropwise to the compound (a).<br>

[0084] For purposes of the present invention in the preparation of any of the oligomeric polythiols comprising reactants (a), (b), and (c), the reactants (a), (b), and (c) may all be reacted together simultaneously (as in a "one pot" process) or mixed together incrementally in various combinations. For example, compound (a) having at least two thiol functional groups may be reacted first with the compound (b) having triple bond functionality in a first reaction vessel to produce a first reaction product, followed by addition of the compound (c) having at least two double bonds to the reaction mixture to react with the first reaction product and yield the oligomeric polythiol of the present invention (or addition of the first reaction product to a second reaction vessel containing the compound (c)). As an alternative, the compound (a) may be reacted first with the compound (c) having at least two double bonds to produce a first reaction product, followed by addition of the compound (b) to yield the oligomeric polythiol.

at least two double bonds, which may be the same as or different from that reacted earlier with compound (a) to form the first reaction product.

Such reactions may typically take place in the presence of a radical initiator as mentioned above, or in the presence of a base catalyst, particularly when the compound (c) comprises a compound having at least one (meth)acrylate type double bonds.

In non-limiting embodiments, said ratio can be within the range of from greater than 1:1 to 3:1, or from 1.01:1 to 3:1, or 1.01:1 to 5:1, or from 1.01:1 to 2:1, .orfrom 1.05:1 to 2:1, or from 1.1:1 to 1.5:1, or from 1.25:1 to 1.5:1.

Various methods of reacting allyl sulfide and dimercaptodiethylsulfide are described in detail in WO 03/042270, page 2, line 16 to page 10, line 7, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Various methods for reacting a dithiol and an aliphatic, ring-containing non-conjugated diene in the presence of free radical initiator are described in detail in WO/01/66623A1, from page 3, line 19 to page 6, line 11, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0088] In reacting the compounds (a) and (c), it may be advantageous to use one or more free radical initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable free radical initiators can include azo compounds, such as those described above;<br>
organic peroxides such as but not limited to benzoyl peroxide and t-butyl peroxide; inorganic peroxides; and similar free-radical generators. [0089] Alternately, the reaction of compounds (a) and (c) can be effected by irradiation with ultraviolet light either with or without a photoinitiating moiety. [0090] The mixture of (a) and (c) can be reacted for a time period of from 1 hour to 5 days and at a temperature of from 20 °C to 100 °C. Often, the mixture is heated until a predetermined theoretical value for SH content is achieved.<br>
[0091] The stoichiometric ratio of the sum of the number of equivalents of triple bond functional groups in compound (b) to the sum of the number of equivalents of double bonds in compound (c) is often within the range of from 0.01:0.99 to 1.00:0, or from 0.10:0.90 to 1.00:0, or from 0.20:0.80 to 1.00:0. [0092] The present invention also is directed to a composition, such as a coating composition, comprising any of the thioether functional, oligomeric polythiols described immediately above comprising compounds (a), (b) and (c).

[0095] The composition can be used to prepare any of the articles of manufacture described hereinbelow such as optical articles, including films and sheets; articles of manufacture for non-optical applications, for example, solar panels, body armor, interior and exterior aircraft and automotive parts such as doors, fascia, and propellers, housings for hand-held electronic devices such as cellular phones, and windmill blades; and coating compositions used to form various coatings, adhesives and/or sealants. In a particular embodiment, the composition comprises a coating composition which can provide coatings having excellent properties including, inter alia, impact and chemical resistance, flexibility, anti-microbial and fungicidal properties, as well as anti-ballistic and flame retardancy characteristics. [0096] Any of the thioether-functional, oligomeric polythiols described herein, when reacted with a reactive compound having functional groups that are reactive with active hydrogens, can produce a polymerizate having a refractive index of at least 1.50, or at least 1.52, or at least 1.55, or at least 1.60, or at least 1.65, or at least 1.67. Additionally, the thioether-functional, oligomeric polythiol of the present invention, when reacted with a reactive compound having functional groups that are reactive with active hydrogens, can produce a polymerizate having an Abbe number of at least 30, or at least 35, or at least 38, or at least 39, or at least 40, or at least 44. The refractive index and Abbe number can be determined by methods known in the art such as American Standard Test Method (ASTM) Number D 542-00, using various<br>
known instruments. The refractive index and Abbe number can also be measured in accordance with ASTM D 542-00 with the following exceptions: (1) test one to two samples/specimens instead of the minimum of three specimens specified in Section 7.3; and (ii) test the samples unconditioned instead of conditioning the samples/specimens prior to testing as specified in Section 8.1. Further, an Atago model DR-M2 Multi-Wavelength Digital Abbe Refractometer can be used to measure the refractive index and Abbe number of the samples/specimens.<br>
[0097] Further, any of the thioether-functional, oligomeric polythiols described herein, when reacted with a reactive compound having functional groups that are reactive with active hydrogens, can produce a polymerizate having a Martens hardness of at least 20 N/mm2, or often at least 50, or more often between 70 and 200. Such polymerizates are typically not elastomeric; i. e., they are not substantially reversibly deformable (e. g., stretchable) due to their rigidity and do not typically exhibit properties characteristic of rubber and other elastomeric polymers.<br>
[0098J Such polymerizates as discussed above may be used to prepare articles of manufacture having similar properties as described above, such as films, coatings, and molded items such as optical articles, in accordance with the present invention.<br>

The optical article also may be chosen from glazings such as<br>
architectural windows and vehicular transparencies such as automobile or aircraft windshields and side windows.<br>
[00101] in the preparation of the reaction products used to prepare the optical articles of the present invention, the reactants (A), (B), and (C) may all be reacted together simultaneously ("one pot") or mixed together incrementally in various combinations ("one or two pot"). Alternatively, reactive compound (A) may be reacted first with the oligomeric polythiol (B) to produce a prepolymer such as a sulfur-containing isocyanate-functional polyurethane, followed by post reaction of the compound (C) containing active hydrogens with the prepolymer to yield the reaction products of the present invention. In another alternative, reactive compound (A) may comprise an isocyanate-functional polyurethane prepolymer prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate with any of the thioether-functional, oligomeric polythiols disclosed herein (e. g., reaction products of a compound having at least two thiol functional groups, a compound having triple bond functionality, and optionally a compound having at least two double bonds) and optionally another active hydrogen-containing material. In this alternative, reactive compound (A) may be reacted with the oligomeric polythiol (B) and compound (C) containing active hydrogens in any combination or order. In embodiments wherein any of the reactants comprises two or more different compounds, the different compounds may be reacted as a mixture or added separately or even at different times/stages of the reaction. For example, the reaction product can be prepared by combining polyisocyanate and/or polyisothiocyanate, polythiol oligomer, optionally a first active hydrogen-containing material, and optionally a urethanation catalyst, to form a sulfur-containing polyurethane prepolymer, and then adding a second, different active hydrogen-containing material and optionally urethanation catalyst to the sulfur-containing polyurethane prepolymer, and polymerizing the resulting mixture.<br>
[00102] Note that the polyurethane prepolymer may contain disulfide linkages due to disulfide linkages contained in the polythiol and/or polythiol oligomer used to prepare the polyurethane prepolymer.<br>

The disclosures of the aforementioned patents on polymerizable organic photochromic materials are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00168] The photochromic materials can be incorporated into the article e.g. the optical article, by various means. For example, the photochromic materials<br>
may be incorporated, e.g., dissolved and/or dispersed, into the composition, or polymerized with other components of the composition. Alternatively, the photochromic materials may be incorporated into the composition by imbibition, permeation or other transfer methods as known by those skilled in the art. [00169] Typically the photochromic material is present in the article in a photochromic amount; that is, in an amount yielding a color change distinguishable by the naked eye upon exposure to radiation. The amount of photochromic material incorporated into the curable film-forming composition may range from 0.5 to 40 weight percent based on the weight of the solids in the curable film-forming composition. The amount of photochromic material may range from 1 to 30 weight percent, from 3 to 20 weight percent, or from 3 to 10 weight percent. The amount of photochromic material in the optical article may range between any combination of these values, inclusive of the recited range.<br>
[00170] The article of the present invention may further comprise an at least partial film or coating superposed thereon. Such a coating or film may comprise, inter alia, a photochromic coating, tint coating, polarizing coating, and/or an abrasion resistant or other protective coating. [00171] The types of material used for the film or coating may vary widely and be chosen from the polymeric organic materials of the substrate and the protective films described hereinafter. Moreover, the film or coating may comprise the previously mentioned reaction products comprising thioether functional, oligomeric polythiols. The thickness of the films of polymeric organic materials may vary widely. The thickness may range, for example, from 0.1 mil to 40 mils and any range of thicknesses between these values, inclusive of the recited values. However, if desired, greater thicknesses may be used.<br>
[00172] The polymeric organic materials may be chosen from thermosetting materials, thermoplastic materials and mixtures thereof. Examples of films of polymeric organic materials are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0096666 in paragraphs [0082] to [0098] which disclosure of such polymeric films is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00173] In certain embodiments, the film or coating comprises thermoplastic polymeric organic materials such as nylon, poly(vinyl acetate), vinyl chloride-vinyi acetate copolymer, poly (C1-C8 alkyl) acrylates, poly (C1-C8 alkyl) methacrylates, styreno-butadiene copolymer resin, poly(urGa-urethanes), polyurethanes, polyterephihalates, polycarbonates, polycarbonate-silicone copolymer and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00174] Optionally, compatible (chemically and color-wise) fixed tint dyes may be added or applied to the optical article and/or superposed films to achieve a more aesthetic result, for medical reasons, or for reasons of fashion. For example, the dye may be selected to complement the color resulting from activated photochromic materials, e.g., to achieve a more neutral color or absorb a particular wavelength of incident light. In another embodiment, the dye may be selected to provide a desired hue to the host material when the photochromic materials are in an unactivated state. [00175] Often, a protective film can be applied to the article surface e.g., to prevent scratches from the effects of friction and abrasion. The protective film connected to the optical article of the present invention is typically an at least partially abrasion resistant film. The phrase "an at least partially abrasion resistant film" refers to an at least partial film of an at least partially cured coating or sheet of a protective polymeric material that demonstrates a resistance to abrasion that is greater than the standard reference material, typically a plastic made of CR-39® monomer available from PPG Industries, Inc, as tested in a method comparable to ASTM F-735 Standard Test Method for Abrasion Resistance of Transparent Plastics and Coatings Using the Oscillating Sand Method.<br>
[00176] The protective film may be chosen from protective sheet materials, protective gradient films (which also provide a gradient in hardness for the films between which they are interposed), protective coatings and combinations thereof. Protective coatings such as hardcoats may be applied onto the surface of the polymeric film, the substrate and/or any applied films, e.g., superjacent to protective transitional films.<br>
[00177] When the protective film is chosen from protective sheet materials, it may be chosen, for example, from the protective polymeric sheet materials<br>
disclosed in paragraphs [0118] to [0126] of U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0096666, incorporated herein by reference. Also the protective film can comprise film or sheet materials comprising the any of the previously mentioned reaction products comprising any of the thioether functional, oligomeric polythiols of the present invention.<br>
[00178] The protective gradient films provide an at least partially abrasion resistant film and may be subsequently coated with another protective film. The protective gradient film may serve to protect the article during shipping or subsequent handling prior to the application of the additional protective film. After application of an additional protective film, the protective gradient film provides a gradient in hardness from one applied film to another. The hardness of such films may be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art. The protective film may also be superjacent to a protective gradient film. Non-limiting examples of protective films providing such gradient properties include the radiation cured (meth)acrylate-based coatings described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0165686 in paragraphs [0010] to [0023] and [0079] to [0173], incorporated herein by reference. [00179] The protective films may also include protective coatings. Examples of protective coatings known in the art that provide abrasion and scratch resistance are chosen from polyfunctional acrylic hard coatings, melamine-based hard coatings, urethane-based hard coatings, alkyd-based coatings and organosilane type coatings. Non-limiting examples of such abrasion resistant coatings are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2004/0096666 in paragraphs [0128] to [0149], and in U.S. Patent Application 2004/0207809 in paragraphs [0205] to [0249], both disclosures incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00180] The optical article of the present invention may optionally further comprise an at least partially polarizing surface treatment, coating, or film. The phrase "at least partially polarizing" means that from some to all of the vibrations of the electric field vector of lightwaves is confined to one direction or plane by the surface treatment. Such polarizing effects may be achieved by applying to the optical element a film having an aligned dichroic material to at least partially polarize transmitted radiation. In one non-limiting embodiment.<br>
a polymeric sheet is stretched to align the dichroic material applied to the polymeric sheet   In another non-limiting embodiment, a coating is cured in a directional fashion, e.g., using polarized ultraviolet radiation, to align the dichroic materials in the coating.<br>
[00181] The optical article may further comprise an at least partially antireflective surface treatment. The phrase "an at least partially antireflective surface" treatment means that there is an at least partial improvement in the antireflective nature of the optical element to which it is applied. In non-limiting embodiments, there may be a reduction in the amount of glare reflected by the surface of the treated optical element and/or an increase in the percent transmittance through the treated optical element as compared to an untreated optical element.<br>
[00182] In other non-limiting embodiments, an at least partially antireflective surface treatment, e.g., a monolayer or multilayer of metal oxides, metal fluorides, or other such materials, can be connected to the surface of the optical article, e.g., lenses, of the present invention through vacuum evaporation, sputtering, or some other method.<br>
[00183] The optical article of the present invention may further comprise an at least partially hydrophobic surface treatment. The phrase "an at least partially hydrophobic surface" is a film that at least partially improves the water repellent nature of the substrate to which it is applied by reducing the amount of water from the surface that can adhere to the substrate as compared to an untreated substrate.<br>
[00184] When the optical article is a lens, the mixture of reactants can be introduced into a mold and the mold can be heated using a variety of conventional techniques known in the art. The thermal cure cycle can vary depending on, for example, the reactivity and molar ratio of the reactants and the presence of catalyst{s). In one example, the thermal cure cycle can include heating the reactants from room temperature to 200 "C over a period of from 0.5 hours to 72 hours.<br>
[00185] The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples that are intended as illustration only, since numerous modifications<br>
and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Examples [00186] In the following examples, unless otherwise stated, the refractive index reported as D-line (nD) and/or E-line (nE) and Abbe number were measured on a multiple wavelength Abbe Refractometer fvlodel DR-M2 manufactured by ATAGO Co., Ltd.; the refractive index and Abbe number of liquids were measured in accordance with ASTM-D1218; the refractive Index and Abbe number of solids was measured in accordance with ASTM-D-542. [00187] The viscosity was measured using a Brookfield CAP 2000+ Viscometer.<br>
[00188] Hardness was measured in accordance with ISO standard test method BS EN ISO 14577-1:2002, using a Fischer Scope H-100 instrument, supplied by Fischer Technology, Inc., and was reported as Martens Hardness (HM 0.3/15/0), in the units of Newtons(N)/mm^. As required In said standard test method, the following test parameters were specified: (Vlaximum Total Load applied to sample was 0.3 Newtons (N), time period over which fvlaximum Total Load was applied to sample was 15 seconds, and the time of duration for which said Maximum Total Load was then applied to sample was 0 seconds. Therefore, the test results were designated with the term "HM 0.3/15/0" in order to reflect these three test parameters. [00189] Impact testing was accomplished in accordance with the Impact Energy Test, as described herein, and the results are reported in energy units (Joules). The Impact Energy Test consists of testing a flat sheet sample of polymerizate having a thickness of 3mm, and cut into a square piece approximately 4cm x 4cm. Said flat sheet sample of polymerizate is supported on a flat O-ring which is attached to top of the pedestal of a steel holder, as defined below. Said O-ring is constructed of neoprene having a hardness of 40 ± 5 Shore A durometer, a minimum tensile strength of 8.3 MPa, and a minimum ultimate elongation of 400 percent, and has an inner diameter of 25 mm, an outer diameter of 31 mm, and a thickness of 2.3 mm. Said steel holder consists of a steel base, with a mass of approximately 12 kg, and a steel pedestal affixed to said steel base. The shape of said steel<br>
pedestal is approximated by the solid shape which would result from adjoining onto the top of a cylinder, having an outer diameter of 75 mm and a height of 10 mm, the frustum of a right circular cone, having a bottom diameter of 75 mm, a top diameter of 25 mm, and a height of 8 mm, wherein the center of said frustum coincides with the center of said cylinder. The bottom of said steel pedestal is affixed to said steel base, and the neoprene O-ring is centered and affixed to the top of the steel pedestal. The flat sheet sample of polymerizate is centered and set on top of the O-ring. The Impact Energy Test is carried out by dropping steel balls of increasing weight from a distance of 50 inches (1.27 meters) onto the center of the flat sheet sample. The sheet is determined to have passed the test if the sheet does not fracture. The sheet is determined to have failed the test when the sheet fractures. As used herein, the term "fracture" refers to a crack through the entire thickness of the sheet into two or more separate pieces, or detachment of one or more pieces of material from the backside of the sheet (i.e., the side of the sheet opposite the side of impact). The impact strength of the sheet is reported as the impact energy that corresponds to the highest level (i.e., largest ball) at which the sheet passes the test, and it is calculated according to the following formula:<br>
E=mgd wherein E represent impact energy in Joules (J), m represents mass of the ball in kilograms (kg), g represents acceleration due to gravity (i.e., 9.80665 m/sec^) and d represents the distance of the ball drop in meters (i.e., 1.27 m). [00190] The NCO concentration of the prepolymer (Component A) was determined by reaction with an excess of n-dibutylamine (DBA) to form the corresponding urea followed by titration of the unreacted DBA with HCi in accordance with the following procedure.
