				<td>DESCRIPTION <br>
EXTERNAL MEDICINE FOR TREATING DERMATITIS PREPARATIONS<br>
FOR TREATING ATOPIC DERMATITIS AND/OR PSORIASIS VULGAR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to external medicine for treating dermatitis<br>
wherein the medicine is especially effective against atopic dermatitis and seborrheic<br>
dermatitis, and which is very safe.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, steroid drugs such as an adrenocortical hormone and the like<br>
which have a high antiinflammatory effect are mainly used for the medical treatment of<br>
dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis. As such a steroid drug of this type, they are many<br>
drugs which have been used wherein a vaseline, a methylcellulose, a surface active<br>
agent, a synthetic resin emulsion, a fine particles and/or the like are added to the steroid<br>
drug and they are creamed in accordance with the purpose of use. Moreover, there are<br>
liquid form steroid drugs which contain a surface active agent.<br>
On the other hand, there are other external medicines having high safety which<br>
are aimed to have (1) sterilization and disinfection action on skin, (2) coating function,<br>
(3) moisturizing accelerating function by preventing evaporation of moisture of skin,<br>
and the like. To these types of the external medicines, an ingredient which use<br>
inorganic salt such as sodium chloride and the like (U.S.P. No. 3,574,854), an ingredient<br>
which uses natural sugar such as grape sugar and the like (U.S.P. No. 3,859,436), or an<br>
ingredient which uses plasma and the like (U.S.P. No. 3,777,597) are used as<br>
compounding ingredients of the external medicine.<br>
Furthermore, an external medicine for treating dermatitis, which is effective for<br>
atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, and the like and is very safe, has been<br>
invented by the inventor of the present invention. (Japanese Patent No. 2,920,611).<br>
This external medicine for treatment is a medicine such that adrenocortical steroid is<br><br>
included by a cyclodextxin to form clathrates, and polysaccharides which is dextran or<br>
pullulan is added thereto. This external medicine does not inhibit the physiological<br>
function of skin, and make it possible to obtain the synergistic effect of the<br>
adrenocortical steroid and natural healing energy with which the living body itself is<br>
equipped.<br>
However, although the adrenocortical steroid has a high medicinal value such as<br>
the antiinflammatory effect and inhibition of multiplication of a fibroblast, it cannot<br>
provide good effect for some reason" or other when it is used for the medical treatment<br>
of atopic dermatitis and the like. The reason is not clear at present as to the causes of<br>
the aforementioned not good effect. However, there is one opinion that such a not<br>
good effect is caused by the oil contained in the ointment or the oil used for providing<br>
the shape of cream, and the oil contained dissolves the horny layer of the skin and<br>
prevents reproduction of the healthy skin. Moreover, there are risks of side effects,<br>
such as an inhibition of functions of a pituitary gland and adrenal cortex, and functional<br>
disorder of the eye, other internal organs and the like, wherein these risks may be<br>
caused when a large amount of an adrenocortical steroid agent is used. In order to<br>
solve these problems, it is desired that the amount of the steroid which has been used for<br>
treatment be reduced while the high medicinal effect of the steroid as an<br>
antiinflammatory agent maintained.<br>
Moreover, an external medicine which uses sodium chloride and the like and has<br>
high safety makes it possible to achieve the purposes of sterilizing and protecting skin<br>
such as softening skin, providing a sanitary condition to skin, and smoothing skin.<br>
However, an effect which is effective in the medical treatment of dermatitis such as<br>
atopic dermatitis is not observed by such a external medicine using sodium chloride and<br>
the like.<br>
On the other hand, the aforementioned external medicine for treatment of the<br>
dermatitis, wherein the medicine was invented previously by the inventors of the<br>
present invention, can prevent an inhibition of, the cell internal respiration, which is<br>
caused by disorder of the membrane of a mitochondria, and can prevent a lowering of<br>
production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is a source of activity of the cell<br>
Furthermore, by the aforementioned external medicine, it is possible to maintain<br>
electrolyte balance and osmotic pressure balance, and to make the medicinal effect of an<br>
adrenocortical steroid act effectively. As a result of these features, the curing effects were<br>
widely observed from the external medicine on many conditions, such as atopic dermatitis,<br>
seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris, eczema, acne and the like. In these conditions that<br>
cured, the seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, acne, and the like were able to show effectiveness<br>
rates which showed an average of 96% or more. On the other hand, the atopic dermatitis<br>
showed effectiveness rate which was an average of only about 95%, and the psoriasis<br>
vulgaris showed effectiveness rate which was an average of only about 90%.<br>
That is, when the aforementioned external medicine for treatment was used, the<br>
stable high effect was observed with respect to the seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, the acne<br>
and the like, but a variation of the effect was observed in atopic dermatitis, and an inferior<br>
result compared with other conditions was observed in psoriasis vulgaris.<br>
The present invention aims to further improve the aforementioned external<br>
medicine for treating dermatitis in order to provide an external medicine for treating<br>
dermatitis, which has higher curing effect especially for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis<br>
vulgaris.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention prepares an external medicines for treating dermatitis,<br>
wherein a cyclodextrin include an adrenocomcal steroid is dissolved in an aqueous<br>
solution containing a polysaccharide; and 0.025 to 0.5% by weight of the adrenocortical<br>
steroid, 0.2 to 30% by weight of the cyclo dextrin, and 0.5 to 55% by weight of a dextran or<br>
a pullulan are comprised. In this pharmaceutical, 0.5 to 55% by weight of each xyloglucan,<br>
trehalose, laminaran, krestin, and pectin are blended. At this time, after the adrenocortical<br>
steroid is dissolved at room temperature using a homo-mixer to include the adrenocortical<br>
steroid in the cyclodextrin, they are added in the aqueous solution while stirring the solution<br>
uniformly.<br>
As other ingredients which are added to the aqueous solution, grape sugar, mutan,<br>
lentinan, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride are added into the aqueous solution. By<br>
such a solution, the similar environment as those obtained by intercellular substance liquid<br>
is made in a cell, and the cell can promote the tendency to perform normal activity. As a<br>
result, synergism between the natural curing energy with which the living body itself is<br>
provided and the adrenocortical steroid agent can be provided.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The basic compounding of the present invention is that an adrenocortical steroid is<br>
dissolved in the aqueous solution containing a polysaccharide wherein the adrenocortical<br>
steroid is beforehand included by a cyclodextrin, in order to dissolve the adrenocortical<br>
steroid, which has hardness of dissolving in water, in an aqueous solution.<br>
As an adrenocortical steroid, diflorasones, hydrocortisones, methyl predonisolones,<br>
dexamethasones, and betamethasones are mainly used. The content of the adrenocortical<br>
steroid is 0.025 to 5% by weight based on the entire contents. Moreover, the content of the<br>
cyclodextrin which contains the adrenocortical steroid is 0.2 to 40% by weight based on the<br>
entire contents.<br>
Furthermore, each xyloglucan, laminaran, krestin, trehalose, and pectin is blended<br>
in an amount of 0.5 to 55% by weight.<br>
Xyloglucan is a component sugar chain which exists universally in the wall<br>
(primary wall) of a plant cell which has elongated and hypertrophied. Plant species<br>
specificity is produced when galactose or fucosyl-galactose combines with a xylose residue.<br>
Lectin can combine with the galactose residue and the fucose residue respectively, but the<br>
function of these branch sugar chain is not solved. Growth of a plant cell is provided<br>
according to the water absorption phenomenon which is originating in the osmotic pressure<br>
which the cell has, and the suction force is produced by reduction of wall pressure which is<br>
caused by the slack of a cell wall. Although the slack of the cell wall is not yet solved, cell<br>
extension is always performed with solubilization and decomposition of xyloglucan, and<br>
xyloglucan is observed as one of the polysaccharides which manage the physiological<br>
activity of a cell.<br>
Laminaran is one of the carbohvdrales and is classified as a laminaran of b<br>
glucan. The laminaran is contained in mushrooms such as shiitake mushroom, and<br>
seaweeds such as kelp, and it has an effect which can increase immunity power. It is<br>
known that intake of the laminaran together with protein is preferable since the<br>
laminaran is difficult to absorbe when it is taken alone.<br>
Krestin is used as irnmunological treatment remedy which reinforce expression<br>
of HLA class I antigen of a human cancer cell, and it is extracted from a coriolus<br>
versicolor mycelium. It is known that this krestin has an immunological medical<br>
treatment action in tumor diseases, such as stomach cancer, colon and rectal cancer, and<br>
small cell lung cancer.<br>
Trehalose is one kind of sugar, and it is contained in mushrooms, seaweed,<br>
baker's yeast, and the like. Recently, the technology for making the trehalose<br>
artificially is established. Trehalose is used for providing a moisturizing effect, or be<br>
used as an alternative sweetener and the like. In the present invention, the trehalose is<br>
used as an ingredient of the external medicine of dermatitis in combination of other<br>
sugar.<br>
Pectin is a natural polysaccharide which is known as a compositional ingredient<br>
of a vegetable cell wall, and it combines with ingredients such as cellulose to connect<br>
and unite cell membranes. The pectin is used as a gelling agent, thickener and stabilizer.<br>
As a result of studying many polysaccharides to determine ingredients suitable<br>
for an external medicine, the inventors achieve the external medicine which is effective<br>
in atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis by combining the xyloglucan, laminaran,<br>
krestin, trehalose, and pectin.<br>
Furthermore, a polysaccharide is added in the aqueous solution which dissolves<br>
an adrenocortical steroid. Dextran, pullulan and the like are used as the polysaccharide,<br>
and the amount thereof is 0.5 to 60% by weight based on the entire contents. In<br>
addition to the polysaccharide, grape sugar, mutan, lentinan, sodium chloride, calcium<br>
chloride, and potassium chloride can be added in the solution which dissolves an<br>
adxenocortical steroid.<br>
Next, the examples of prescription and a pharmacological test are given below,<br>
and the external medicine of the present invention is explained concretely.<br>
Prescription example 1<br>
Dextran 3 (g)<br>
Grape Sugar 5<br>
Maltose 5<br>
Mannitol 15<br>
Sodium Chloride 0.2<br>
Betamethasone 0.06<br>
Cyclodextrin 15<br>
Xyloglucan 2<br>
Trehalose 3<br>
Laminaran 2.5<br>
Krestin 3<br>
Pectin 1.24<br>
Purified water 45<br>
The entire content is 100.0g<br>
Aforementioned example of prescription was prepared as follows. At first, 10%<br>
solution of cyclodextrin was made by using purified water which was some part of<br>
purified water which had been prepared for this prescription. Then, betamethasone was<br>
added to the solution while conducting stirring. Xyloglucan, trehalose, laminaran,<br>
krestin, and pectin were further added to the solution with the remaining purified water<br>
and salts.<br>
Next, the effect of the prescription example I is shown below.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of the pharmacological test of the prescription example<br>
1. From the results, the effective rate of the atopic dermatitis, which is the most noted<br>
dermatitis in the present invention, is 96 to 98% and an average thereof is 97.5%.<br>
That is, it turns out that the medicine has high effective rate without variation thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the quite high cure effect is observed in the psoriasis vulgaris such<br>
that the effective rate is 95%, although the rate does not reach the effective rate of atopic<br>
dermatitis. Moreover, the point which should be mentioned especially is that no side<br>
effects have been observed among the 300 cases. This feature is also observed in the<br>
previous external medicine by the inventors, and the safety of the improved external<br>
medicine of the present invention was also verified by the evaluation.<br>
Effectiveness was calculated by the following formula after obtaining total values<br>
of each object. The total values were obtained such that a result that did not show any<br>
change by use of the external medicine of the present invention was set as the zero point,<br>
a result that showed a change which is changed to be cured by use of the external<br>
medicine was made into one point, and a result wherein the effect was observed by the<br>
use of the external medicine was made into two points.<br>
These results of the pharmacological tests of the atopic dermatitis were carried out<br>
at each clinic in Nagareyama, Sendai, Omiya, and Kichijoji. The resulting data of the<br>
pharmacological test of other dermatitis were carried out at the Nagareyama clinic.<br>
As shown in the results of the pharmacological test of the prescription example<br>
1, 90% or more of curative improvement was observed in all effective rates, and there<br>
are people wherein the external medicine of the present invention act early and they no<br>
longer need the external medicine after about the seventh day to thirtieth day have<br>
passed. Furthermore, by applying a solution containing a polysaccharide but not<br>
containing an adrenocortical steroid (Japanese Patent No. 1,597,430) to the objects, the<br>
dermatitis was cured completely. Moreover, moisturizing effect to skin was evaluated<br>
in three levels "good", "normal" and "bad" in the experiment, and the results are shown<br>
below.<br>
It was found that the effects of the aforementioned prescription examples 2 to 6<br>
followed the effect of the prescription example 1. The prescriptions can be suitably<br>
selected according to the condition of each dermatitis.<br>
Next, comparison explanation is given about the conventional prescription and its<br>
medicical value.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of the pharmacological test of the prescription example 7<br>
(the conventional prescription). (The calculation method of effectiveness and the clinic<br>
where the pharmacological test was conducted were the same as those of Table 1). As is<br>
apparent from the results, the effective rate of atopic dermatitis is only about 95%, and the<br>
effective rate of psoriasis vulgaris about an average of 90%, although the conventional<br>
prescription provide an average of 96% or more of effective rate with respect to the<br>
seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, acne and the like.<br>
On the other hand, it is clear from the prescription example 1 that the cure effect is<br>
increased with respect to atopic dermatitis and a psoriasis vulgaris especially, by adding<br>
xyloglucan, trehalose, laminaran, krestin, and pectin.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
An external medicine for treating dermatitis of the present invention is such that a<br>
cyclodextrin includes an adrenocortical steroid, and it is dissolved in an aqueous solution<br>
containing a polysaccharide, and 0.025 to 0.5% by weight of the adrenocortical steroid, 0.2<br>
to 30% by weight of the cyclodextrin, and 0.5 to 55% by weight of a dextran or a pullulan is<br>
comprised. Furthermore, by including 0.5 to 55% of the weight of each xyloglucan,<br>
trehalose, laminaran, krestin and pectin in the external' medicine, the excellent and<br>
stabilized cure effect is achieved even in the atopic dermatitis wherein the variation of an<br>
effect have been observed when the previous external medicine is used.<br>
Moreover, even in the psoriasis vulgaris, which showed inferior cure effect<br>
compared with other dermatitises when the previous external medicine for treatment was<br>
used, the effective rate was able to be raised to the levels of other dermatitis by the present<br>
invention.<br>
In this way, according to the present invention, it become possible to greatly raise an<br>
effective rate as compared with previous external medicines. Particularly, the external<br>
medicine of the present invention is very effective in diseases which have been difficult to<br>
cure such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis and the like. From viewpoints such as<br>
high cure rate and high safety such as extremely low side effects, the external medicine of<br>
the present invention can be used as a medicine which can supersede the conventional<br>
external medicine. The external medicine of the present invention can be expected to be j<br>
used for a large number of patients and the like all over the world who have suffered from<br>
intractable dermatitis. The significance of the present invention is great, and it can greatly<br>
contribute to human beings.<br>
