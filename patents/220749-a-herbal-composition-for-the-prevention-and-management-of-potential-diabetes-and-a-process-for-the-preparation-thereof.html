				<td>Field of Invention :<br>
This invention relates to a herbal composition and a process for the preparation thereof wherein the composition is useful for prevention and management of blood glucose levels among the potential diabetics who exhibit variation in the blood glucose levels and are supposed to be at risk of developing full fledged diabetes mellitus in future. The composition of the present invention may also be advantageously used in the management of type I diabetes mellitus i.e. non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes mellitus come under the range of potential diabetes. In such cases glucose tolerance is above the conventional normal range but lower than the level considered as diabetes range. Majority of such persons do have a risk of developing full-fledged diabetes mellitus. The impaired glucose tolerance is more frequent in obese than the non-obese. Certain class of medication, genetic background, autoimmune phenomena, life style including stress factor are responsible for the development of full-fledged diabetes mellitus.<br>
In this early phase of altered blood glucose levels, if persisting for longer time, there will be minor changes in the renal function resulting the micro albuminurea and other minor vascular changes. Till date no suitable drug therapy is available which can prevent or prolong the onset of full-fledged diabetes mellitus and related complications. It is well proven that early onset of diabetes required prolonged therapy to manage the diabetes and its complications. Drug resistance is the major problem as regards the autidiabetic therapy is concern. Therefore it was thought proper to provide a formulation, which can delay the onset of diabetes and thus the complications caused due to hyperglycaemia may be prevented or minimized without any side effect.<br>
Objects of the present invention :<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and a process for the preparation thereof useful for the prevention and management of potential diabetes or to prevent/manage the risk level of glucose intolerance.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and a process for the preparation thereof useful to delay the onset of full fledged diabetes mellitus by managing the glucose intolerance at initial stage.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and a process for the preparation thereof useful for the prevention of micro-albuminurea by regulating blood glucose level.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and a process for the preparation thereof useful for preventing the individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes in near future from drug resistance.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a herbal composition to enhance the body immunity among potential diabetes.<br>
