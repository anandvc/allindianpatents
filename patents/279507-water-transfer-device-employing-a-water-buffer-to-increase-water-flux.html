				<td>WATER TRANSFER DEVICE<br>
EMPLOYING A WATER BUFFER TO INCREASE WATER FLUX<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to water transfer devices and,<br>
particularly, to water transfer membrane assemblies that facilitate the transfer of<br>
water between fluid streams passing through a water transfer device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present teachings and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] The ability to transfer water between fluid streams that are<br>
maintained separate from one another can be useful in a variety of applications.<br>
By way of example, one such application is in a fuel cell system wherein one or<br>
more of the reactant streams are humidified by another fluid stream.<br>
[0004] Fuel cells can be operated in a manner that maintains a<br>
membrane, such as a proton exchange membrane (PEM), in a humidified state.<br>
The humidity level of the membrane can affect the performance of the fuel cells.<br>
The membrane can be damaged if operated in a dry condition which can result in<br>
immediate failure or reduction of the useful life of the fuel cells. To humidify the<br>
membrane, the fuel cells can be operated in a flooded condition during which the<br>
humidity level within the fuel cells is greater than 100% and liquid water is formed<br>
during the production of electricity.<br>
 <br>
[0005] To further humidify the membrane, the cathode and/or anode<br>
reactant gases being supplied to the fuel cells can be humidified in a water<br>
transfer device. The water transfer device can receive a cathode effluent,<br>
expelled from the fuel cells, which can contain water in a gaseous and/or liquid<br>
state. A portion of the water content of the cathode effluent can be transferred to<br>
the cathode or anode reactant gas also flowing through the water transfer device.<br>
In this manner, the humidity of the cathode or anode reactant gas can be<br>
increased before being supplied to the fuel cell.<br>
[0006] The water transfer, or water flux, can be facilitated by a water<br>
transfer membrane assembly within the water transfer device. Traditional water<br>
transfer membrane assemblies facilitate water flux from only the gaseous portion<br>
of the water content while the liquid water portion is expelled from the water<br>
transfer device along with the associated fluid stream. Expelling liquid water can<br>
be a lost resource. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a water<br>
transfer device capable of utilizing liquid water to increase water flux. It would be<br>
further advantageous to increase the efficiency of the water transfer device.<br>
Increased efficiency can advantageously allow the use of a smaller water transfer<br>
device to humidify a given fluid stream. Increased efficiency can also<br>
advantageously reduce the amount of water lost (unrecovered) from the system<br>
within which the water transfer device is utilized.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A water transfer device according to the present teachings<br>
includes a first and second flow path each having an inlet and an outlet for<br>
respectively receiving and discharging first and second fluid streams. A water<br>
transfer membrane can communicate with and separate the first and second flow<br>
paths and can transfer a portion of a water content of a first fluid stream flowing<br>
through the first flow path to a second fluid stream flowing through the second<br>
flow path. A first diffusion medium can be disposed between the water transfer<br>
membrane and the first flow path. The first diffusion medium is hydrophilic and is<br>
operable to absorb liquid water in the first flow path, hold the absorbed liquid<br>
water in contact with the water transfer membrane, and transfer water to the<br>
water transfer membrane. The first diffusion medium is also operable to diffuse<br>
water vapor, transport water vapor in the first flow path to the water transfer<br>
membrane, and transfer the diffused water vapor to the water transfer<br>
membrane.<br>
[0008] The water transfer device according to the present teachings<br>
can be utilized in a system wherein water content from a cathode effluent stream<br>
discharged from a fuel cell stack can be routed through the first flow path and a<br>
cathode reactant stream for the fuel cell stack can be routed through the second<br>
flow path. Water content from the cathode effluent stream can be transferred to<br>
the cathode reactant stream through the hydrophilic diffusion medium and the<br>
water transfer membrane separating the two fluid streams.<br>
 <br>
[0009] A method of utilizing the water transfer device according to the<br>
present teachings can include: (1) supplying a first fluid stream to the first flow<br>
path in the water transfer device, the first fluid stream having a first water content<br>
upon entering the first flow path; (2) supplying a second fluid stream to the<br>
second flow path in the water transfer device, the second fluid stream having a<br>
second water content upon entering the second flow path that is less than the<br>
first water content; (3) absorbing liquid water from the first fluid stream with the<br>
hydrophilic diffusion medium; (4) transporting the liquid water absorbed by the<br>
hydrophilic diffusion medium to the water transfer membrane; (5) diffusing water<br>
vapor from the first fluid stream into the hydrophilic diffusion medium; (6)<br>
transporting the water vapor diffused in the hydrophilic diffusion medium to the<br>
water transfer membrane; and (7) transferring water from the hydrophilic diffusion<br>
medium through the water transfer membrane and into the second fluid stream<br>
flowing through the second flow path.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present teachings, applications, or uses.<br>
[0020] A water transfer device (WTD) 20 according to the present<br>
teachings can be utilized in a fuel cell system 22, such as that shown in Figure 1.<br>
Fuel cell system 22 can include WTD 20, a fuel cell stack 24, a fuel (anode<br>
reactant) supply 26, an oxidant (cathode reactant) supply 28 and a pair of control<br>
valves 30, 31. Anode reactant supply 26 is connected to stack 24 via appropriate<br>
supply plumbing 32. An anode reactant stream 34, such as hydrogen, is<br>
supplied from anode reactant supply 26 to stack 24 through plumbing 32.<br>
Cathode reactant supply 28 is connected to stack 24 via appropriate supply<br>
plumbing 33 and provides a cathode reactant stream 36, such as compressed air<br>
or oxygen, to stack 24. WTD 20 and control valves 30, 31 can be disposed in<br>
supply plumbing 33 between stack 24 and cathode reactant supply 28. A first<br>
control valve 30 can adjust a first cathode reactant stream 38 supplied to WTD<br>
20. A second control valve 31 can adjust a second cathode reactant stream 40<br>
that bypasses WTD 20. Streams 38, 40 merge downstream of WTD 20 to form<br>
cathode reactant stream 36 supplied to stack 24. Stack 24 is operable to convert<br>
anode and cathode reactant streams 34, 36 into electricity, an anode effluent<br>
stream 41 and a cathode effluent stream 42. Anode effluent stream 41 can be<br>
discharged from stack 24. Cathode effluent stream 42 can flow through WTD 20<br>
prior to being exhausted from fuel cell system 22.<br>
 <br>
[0021] WTD 20 can receive both cathode effluent stream 42 expelled<br>
from stack 24 and first cathode reactant stream 38. WTD 20 can maintain<br>
cathode effluent stream 42 separate from first cathode reactant stream 38 while<br>
transferring a portion of the water content of cathode effluent stream 42 to first<br>
cathode reactant stream 38, thereby humidifying cathode reactant stream 36<br>
supplied to stack 24. Bypass valves 30, 31 can adjust the ratio of first and<br>
second cathode reactant streams 38, 40 to achieve a desired relative humidity<br>
for cathode reactant stream 36.<br>
[0022] The fluid flow paths of WTD 20 are shown in greater detail in<br>
Figures 2-4. Referring to Figure 2, WTD 20 can include a plurality of plates 60<br>
arranged adjacent one another with water transfer membrane assemblies<br>
(WTMA) 64 disposed therebetween. Plates 60 and WTMAs 64 can be clamped<br>
together to form a stacked configuration 62. Plate 60 can be a thin sheet of<br>
metal, such as stainless steel, or a polymer, by way of non-limiting example.<br>
Plate 60 can have a first surface 65 with a plurality of grooves or channels 66<br>
separated by a plurality of lands 68 therebetween. Grooves 66 and lands 68 on<br>
first surface 65 form a plurality of lands 70 and grooves 72, respectively, on a<br>
second surface 74 of plate 60. Grooves 66, 72 and lands 68, 70 can be<br>
arranged in a variety of configurations to provide a desired flow path through<br>
WTD 20. Plates 60 can be arranged so that first surface 65 of one plate 60 faces<br>
second surface 74 of an adjacent plate 60 with lands 68, 70 on facing first and<br>
second surfaces 65, 74 aligned and compressing WTMA 64 therebetween.<br>
Grooves 66, 72 in the facing first and second surfaces 65, 74 thereby form a<br>
 <br>
plurality of adjacent flow paths 78, 80 for first cathode reactant stream 38 and<br>
cathode effluent stream 42, respectively, separated by WTMA 64. Flow paths<br>
78, 80 mimic the path of grooves 66, 72 formed in plate 60. Water is transferred<br>
from cathode effluent stream 42 traversing flow paths 80 to first cathode reactant<br>
streams 38 traversing flow paths 78 through WTMA 64, as described below. The<br>
number and dimensions of adjacent plates 60 with WTMAs 64 therebetween can<br>
vary based on the desired size and operation of WTD 20.<br>
[0023] Referring to Figure 4, each flow path 78, 80 has a respective<br>
inlet 82, 84 along a side or edge of plate 60 and a respective outlet 86, 88 formed<br>
along the other side or edge for receiving and expelling first cathode reactant<br>
stream 38 and cathode effluent stream 42, respectively. The plurality of inlets<br>
82 and outlets 86 of flow path 78 can respectively communicate with a first inlet<br>
manifold 90 (Figure 1) where first cathode reactant stream 38 enters WTD 20<br>
and a first outlet manifold 92 (Figure 1) where first cathode reactant stream 38<br>
exits WTD 20. Similarly, the plurality of inlets 84 and outlets 88 of flow paths 80<br>
can respectively communicate with a second inlet manifold 94 (Figure 1) where<br>
cathode effluent stream 42 enters WTD 20 and a second outlet manifold 96<br>
(Figure 1) where cathode effluent stream 42 exits WTD 20. First and second<br>
inlet manifolds 90, 94 and first and second outlet manifolds 92, 96 can be located<br>
on opposite sides of WTD 20, as shown, such that first cathode reactant stream<br>
38 and cathode effluent stream 42 flow in opposite directions (counter-flow)<br>
through WTD 20. It should be appreciated, however, that co-flow or cross-flow<br>
arrangements can be utilized. Additionally, while generally horizontal flow paths<br>
 <br>
78, 80 are shown, it should be appreciated that generally vertical flow paths or<br>
arrangements therebetween could be utilized although all of the benefits of the<br>
present teachings may not be realized.<br>
[0024] Referring to Figures 2-4, WTMA 64 can include a water transfer<br>
membrane 100 disposed between first and second diffusion media 102, 104.<br>
First diffusion medium 102 can face flow paths 78 and communicate with first<br>
cathode reactant stream 38 while second diffusion medium 104 can face flow<br>
paths 80 and communicate with cathode effluent stream 42. First and second<br>
diffusion media 102, 104 can provide structural support to water transfer<br>
membrane 100, thereby inhibiting deformation of water transfer membrane 100.<br>
In some embodiments, membrane 100 can be coated on one or both of the<br>
diffusion mediums 102, 104.<br>
[0025] As shown in Figure 4, first diffusion medium 102 borders flow<br>
path 78 on one side and abuts water transfer membrane 100 on the opposite<br>
side. A leading edge 110, defined by a first face 112, which can be substantially<br>
perpendicular to flow path 78, and a second face 114, which can be substantially<br>
parallel to flow path 78, is located near inlet 82, such that first face 112 is<br>
immediately exposed to first cathode reactant stream 38 when it enters flow path<br>
78. Similarly, second diffusion medium 104 borders flow path 80 on one side<br>
and abuts water transfer membrane 100 on the opposite side. A leading edge<br>
120, defined by a first face 122, which can be substantially perpendicular to flow<br>
path 80, and a second face 124, which can be substantially parallel to flow path<br>
80, is located near inlet 84, such that first face 122 is immediately exposed to<br>
 <br>
cathode effluent stream 42 when it enters flow path 80. In an embodiment where<br>
membrane 100 is coated on the diffusion mediums 102, 104, the diffusion<br>
mediums 102, 104 can extend the length of membrane 100. It should be<br>
appreciated that different methods of gasketing and orientations of plates 60 can<br>
alter this configuration.<br>
[0026] First diffusion medium 102 can be a thin porous material that<br>
can capture and diffuse gaseous fluids. First diffusion medium 102 can be<br>
hydrophobic in that it can absorb water vapor while repelling liquid water. Such<br>
diffusion medium can be made from a variety of materials. For example, first<br>
diffusion medium 102 can be Toray T030 or Toray T060 paper available from<br>
Fuel Cell Store of Boulder, Colorado, or other fibrous mat or support on the order<br>
of 100 urn. First diffusion medium 102 can diffuse water transferred through<br>
membrane 100 into cathode reactant stream 38 flowing through flow paths 78.<br>
[0027] Second diffusion medium 104 can be hydrophilic in that it can<br>
absorb both liquid water and water vapor from cathode effluent stream 42 and<br>
facilitate communication between both liquid water and water vapor with water<br>
transfer membrane 100, as described below. Second diffusion medium 104 can<br>
be a thin porous material, such as Toray T030 or Toray T060 paper available<br>
from Fuel Cell Store of Boulder, Colorado, or other fibrous mat or support on the<br>
order of 100 urn. Second diffusion medium 104, if not hydrophilic by nature, can<br>
have a solution of polyethylene glycol diacrylate and polyethylene glycol acrylate<br>
cured thereon by ultra violet light or other hydrophilic treatments. Alternatively,<br>
 <br>
second diffusion medium 104 can be a thin hydrophilic coating applied directly to<br>
water transfer membrane 100.<br>
[0028] Water transfer membrane 100 has one side in contact with first<br>
diffusion medium 102 and a second side in contact with second diffusion medium<br>
104. Water transfer membrane 100 can be a thin, micro-porous or dense<br>
membrane that can allow water in cathode effluent stream 42 to pass<br>
therethrough and humidify first cathode reactant stream 38. Water transfer<br>
membrane 100 can take a variety of forms. For example, water transfer<br>
membrane 100 can be NAFION® 112 available from DuPont of Wilmington,<br>
Delaware. Some dense membranes like NAFION® 112, as explained below,<br>
exhibit a step change in water flux when in contact with liquid water. Water<br>
transfer membranes having such a step change in water flux can advantageously<br>
be utilized in the present teachings.<br>
[0029] During typical operation of fuel cell system 22, cathode effluent<br>
stream 42 can have a higher water content than first cathode reactant stream 38.<br>
The water content of cathode effluent stream 42 can be in both gaseous and<br>
liquid form. In WTD 20, WTMA 64 separates flow paths 78, 80 and facilitates<br>
water transfer (water flux), indicated by arrows 130 in Figure 4, from cathode<br>
effluent stream 42 to first cathode reactant stream 38. To facilitate this water<br>
flux, the liquid portion of cathode effluent stream 42 is desired to be captured by<br>
second diffusion medium 104 as it contacts and flows across faces 122, 124, as<br>
described below. The hydrophilic properties of second diffusion medium 104<br>
facilitate the capturing of the liquid water content of cathode effluent stream 42<br>
 <br>
and dispersing the captured liquid water to the surface of water transfer<br>
membrane 100. As a result of liquid water contacting with the surface of water<br>
transfer membrane 100, the water flux 130 through water transfer membrane 100<br>
is enhanced. As water is transported from cathode effluent stream 42 to first<br>
cathode reactant stream 38 through water transfer member 100 along flow path<br>
80, the water content in cathode effluent stream 42 is reduced and expelled from<br>
WTD 20 through second outlet manifold 96 having a water content less than<br>
when it entered WTD 20.<br>
[0030] Simultaneous to the flow of cathode effluent stream 42 through<br>
WTD 20, first cathode reactant stream 38 enters WTD 20 through first inlet<br>
manifold 90 and flows through flow paths 78. While traversing flow paths 78, first<br>
cathode reactant stream 38 is in direct communication with first diffusion medium<br>
102. A portion of first cathode reactant stream 38 can be captured by first<br>
diffusion medium 102 and diffused throughout the rest of first diffusion medium<br>
102 as it contacts and flows across faces 112, 114. The diffused portion can<br>
traverse first diffusion medium 102 until it is in communication with water transfer<br>
membrane 100. The diffused first cathode reactant stream 38 can absorb some<br>
of the water flux 130 held within and transferred through water transfer<br>
membrane 100. The diffused first cathode reactant stream 38 re-enters flow path<br>
78 after absorbing the water flux 130 and is replaced by newly captured and<br>
diffused first cathode reactant stream 38. As a result, first cathode reactant<br>
stream 38 exits WTD 20 through first outlet manifold 92 having a water content<br>
greater than when it entered WTD 20.<br>
 <br>
[0031] Optimizing water flux 130 from cathode effluent stream 42 to<br>
cathode reactant stream 36 is desirable to help fuel cell system 22 maintain the<br>
membrane in stack 24 at a desired humidity level. The present teachings<br>
achieve this goal by improving the water flux 130 across water transfer<br>
membrane 100, as set forth below.<br>
[0032] As previously discussed, the water content of cathode effluent<br>
stream 42 can be comprised of both water vapor and liquid water generated by<br>
fuel cell system 22. The rate of liquid water generation (FG) in stack 24 can vary<br>
as the operation of fuel cell system 22 changes. Operation of fuel cell system 22<br>
can be characterized as nominal operation and transient operation. Nominal<br>
operation generally corresponds to when the current load on stack 24 remains<br>
generally constant. Transient operation can correspond to when the current load<br>
on stack 24 is changing and when fuel cell system 22 undergoes a cold start.<br>
[0033] Ideally, the liquid water generation rate (FG) during nominal<br>
operation of fuel cell system 22 will be zero and all of the water content<br>
generated by stack 24 is in vapor form. However, some liquid water can be<br>
generated by stack 24 during nominal operation or some condensation can occur<br>
within stack 24 and/or cathode effluent plumbing 44. The condensation can be<br>
more pronounced as the relative humidity of cathode effluent stream 42<br>
increases. The liquid water generation rate (FG) can remain generally constant<br>
during nominal operation. For example, the liquid water generation rate (FG) of<br>
stack 24 can be about 1.3 x 10-5 gm/(sec cm2 stack membrane area) when stack<br>
24 is outputting a substantially constant current load of about 0.4 A/cm2 and<br>
 <br>
operating at about 60°C. As another example, the liquid water generation rate<br>
(FG) of can be about 1.1 x 10"4 gm/(sec cm2 stack membrane area) when stack<br>
24 is outputting a substantially constant current load of about 1.5 A/cm2 and<br>
operating at about 40°C. These current loads can approximate representative<br>
higher and lower current loads on stack 24 during nominal operation.<br>
Hereinafter, WTD 20 operation corresponding to nominal operation of fuel cell<br>
system 22 when the liquid water generation rate (FG) is generally constant is<br>
referred to as steady-state operation.<br>
[0034] During transient operation of stack 24, the liquid water<br>
generation rate (FG) can change and rapid liquid water generation spikes can<br>
occur. Cold starts, in particular, can create a large spike in the liquid water<br>
generation rate (FG). Similarly, transitions from one current load to another<br>
current load can cause the liquid water generation rate (FG) to increase or<br>
decrease. Hereinafter, WTD 20 operation corresponding to transient operation of<br>
fuel cell system 22 wherein the liquid water generation rate (FG) can change<br>
and/or spike is referred to as non-steady-state operation.<br>
[0035] WTDs of the prior art have membrane assemblies with<br>
hydrophobic diffusion media on both sides of the water transfer membrane and<br>
expel the liquid water or have no diffusion media. The hydrophobic diffusion<br>
media inhibits liquid water absorption and communication with the water transfer<br>
membrane. Once expelled, the liquid water is not recovered, and the potential<br>
water flux of the liquid water is lost. During steady-state operation, this non-<br>
realized water flux may be small because the quantity of liquid water can be<br>
 <br>
small. However, the non-realized water flux can be more pronounced during<br>
non-steady-state operation. With no diffusion media, membrane surface area is<br>
lost.<br>
[0036] WTD 20, particularly WTMA 64, of the present teachings can<br>
advantageously increase water flux of WTD 20 when cathode effluent stream 42<br>
contains liquid water by realizing at least a portion of the potential water flux of<br>
the liquid water instead of simply expelling the liquid water from WTD 20. This<br>
water flux increase over typical prior art WTDs is described below.<br>
[0037] In Figure 5, a graphical representation of theoretical water<br>
fluxes of a bare water transfer membrane 100, of a WTMA of the prior art (both<br>
diffusion mediums being hydrophobic), and of a WTMA 64 according to the<br>
present teaching (the diffusion media in contact with the relatively more humid<br>
fluid stream (donor fluid stream) being hydrophilic with the other diffusion media<br>
being hydrophobic) that are believed to occur as a function of increasing relative<br>
humidity of the donor fluid stream in contact therewith and when the water<br>
content of the donor fluid stream results in a 100% liquid water in contact<br>
therewith is shown. The transition between water vapor and 100% liquid water is<br>
represented by vertical line 138. The water flux for a bare water transfer<br>
membrane 100 is represented by curve 140. As shown, the water flux 140<br>
increases as the relative humidity of the donor fluid stream increases. A<br>
maximum water vapor flux 140 is achieved when the relative humidity of the<br>
donor fluid stream reaches 100% and changes to liquid water. The water flux<br>
140 undergoes a step change when the donor fluid stream transitions from 100%<br>
 <br>
water vapor (0% liquid water) to 100% liquid water in contact therewith. As<br>
shown, a maximum water flux is achieved when the water content is 100% liquid<br>
water in contact with the bare water transfer membrane 100.<br>
[0038] The water flux for the MTMA of the prior art (which have<br>
hydrophobic diffusion media on both sides) is represented by curve 144. Similar<br>
to the water flux 140 for the bare water transfer membrane 100, water flux 144<br>
increases as the relative humidity of the donor fluid stream increases. A<br>
maximum water vapor flux is achieved as the relative humidity of the donor fluid<br>
stream approaches 100%. As illustrated, the use of hydrophobic diffusion media<br>
and their associated diffusive properties increase the water flux versus that of the<br>
bare water transfer membrane while the donor fluid stream does not contain<br>
liquid water. It is believed that this is achieved by the hydrophobic diffusion<br>
media facilitating communication between the humid fluid stream and the water<br>
transfer membrane along with the diffusion media supporting the water transfer<br>
membrane away from the lands of the flow field. However, water flux 144 is<br>
believed to be maintained at about the same maximum value level as 100%<br>
vapor when in contact with 100% liquid, as indicated by the portion of curve 144<br>
to the right of transition line 138. This constant water flux 144 is believed to<br>
occur because the hydrophobic diffusion media prevents liquid water from<br>
access to the surface of the water transfer membrane, thus the water flux<br>
increase as a result of contacting with liquid water is not realized.<br>
[0039] Water flux for a WTMA 64 according to the present teachings is<br>
represented by curve 146. Curve 146 is shown as being identical to curve 144<br>
 <br>
when the water in the donor fluid stream is in vapor form because it is believed<br>
that the use of either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic diffusion media in contact with<br>
the humid donor fluid stream has a negligible difference on the water flux when<br>
the water content is in the vapor form. As shown, however, when WMTA 64 is in<br>
contact with liquid water, water flux jumps significantly and is shown as being<br>
identical to that of curve 140 to the right of transition line 138. It is believed that<br>
the hydrophilic diffusion media in contact with the liquid water causes WTMA 64<br>
to allow the liquid water portion of the fluid stream to communicate directly with<br>
the water transfer membrane 100 therein, thereby taking advantage of the step<br>
change in the water flux of water transfer membrane 100 when in contact with<br>
liquid water. Thus, in WTMA 64, a maximum water flux is believed to be<br>
achieved when the fluid stream has transitioned to 100% liquid water in contact<br>
with the hydrophilic diffusion media therein.<br>
[0040] It should be appreciated that the water flux curves 140, 144, 146<br>
of Figure 5 are theoretical and exemplary in nature and do not reflect actual data<br>
points. Furthermore, it should also be appreciated that curves 144 and 146 to<br>
the left of transition line 138 may differ from one another depending on, among<br>
other things, the diffusive properties of the diffusion media in contact with the<br>
donor fluid stream.<br>
[0041] When comparing the water flux trends shown in Figure 5, it is<br>
apparent that the water flux over a given surface area of water transfer<br>
membrane 100 will be higher when in communication with liquid water than when<br>
in communication with water vapor. Thus, the water flux during operation of<br>
 <br>
WTD 20 can be increased by facilitating communication between liquid water<br>
therein and water transfer membrane 100. As shown by water flux curve 146,<br>
the use of a hydrophilic second diffusion medium 104, in contact with the donor<br>
fluid stream and with the water transfer membrane 100, can facilitate the<br>
communication between the liquid water and the water transfer membrane 100.<br>
The hydrophilic second diffusion medium 104 can absorb a portion of the liquid<br>
water generated during steady-state and non-steady-state operation that would<br>
otherwise be expelled from the WTDs of the prior art (due to the use of<br>
hydrophobic diffusion media) and hold the absorbed liquid water in contact with<br>
water transfer membrane 100. The potential water flux of the absorbed liquid<br>
water can then be realized by a WTD 20 according to the present teachings.<br>
[0042] Returning now to Figure 4, as cathode effluent stream 42 enters<br>
flow path 80, gravity will cause liquid water to fall toward the bottom of flow path<br>
80. As the liquid water traverses flow path 80, the liquid water can encounter first<br>
face 122 of second diffusion medium 104. Second diffusion medium 104 can<br>
absorb the liquid water through first face 122 creating a wicking effect whereby<br>
liquid water entering flow path 80 can be wicked out of flow path 80 and into<br>
second diffusion medium 104.<br>
[0043] It can be desirable that a wickability (Fs), the rate at which the<br>
liquid water can be wicked from flow path 80, of second diffusion medium 104 is<br>
greater than the liquid water generation rate (FG) during steady-state operation to<br>
help maintain flow path 80 unobstructed by liquid water. Unobstructed flow path<br>
80 can allow a greater quantity of cathode effluent stream 42 to enter WTD 20<br>
 <br>
and communicate with water transfer membranes 100, thereby improving water<br>
flux.<br>
[0044] Wickability (Fs) can be defined as a volume of water that can be<br>
absorbed on a face of the diffusion medium in a finite period of time and can be<br>
represented as:<br>
FS = DWA/L<br>
where<br>
Fs = wickability (gram/s);<br>
Dw = wicking coefficient (g/cm-s);<br>
L = length over which wicking occurs (cm); and<br>
A = cross-sectional area of wicking material (cm2).<br>
As can be seen in equation (1), wickability (Fs) can be affected by the wicking<br>
coefficient (Dw) of the diffusion medium, the length (L) and the cross-sectional<br>
area (A) of the diffusion medium. The length L and the cross-sectional depth of<br>
the diffusion medium will generally be determined by the length and quantity of<br>
flow paths 78, 80 necessary to generate the desired water flux during steady-<br>
state operation. The cross-sectional thickness will generally be limited by the<br>
vapor diffusion requirements of the diffusion medium, as discussed below.<br>
[0045] The wicking coefficient (Dw) of the diffusion medium is<br>
determined by the fundamental material properties of the diffusion media, which<br>
can be affected by the surface property (i.e., contact angle, porosity, and pore<br>
size of the diffusion media), and can be represented as:<br>
  (2)<br>
 <br>
where<br>
Dw = wicking coefficient (gram/cm-s);<br>
P = permeability (cm2);<br>
C = capillary pressure (kPa); and<br>
v = kinematic viscosity (KPa sec cm3/gm).<br>
As can be seen in equation (2), the wicking coefficient (Dw) can be effected by,<br>
among other things, the permeability (P) of the diffusion medium to water, the<br>
capillary pressure (C), and the kinematic viscosity (v). Permeability of the<br>
diffusion medium can be affected by porosity and an average pore diameter of<br>
the diffusion medium. The capillary pressure of the diffusion medium, which is<br>
the force generated by liquid in the capillaries, can be affected by the surface<br>
tension of liquid water, contact angle, and the average pore diameter.<br>
[0046] It should be appreciated from equations (1) and (2) and the<br>
previous discussion that the wickability (Fs) for the diffusion medium can be<br>
increased or decreased by, among other things, altering the cross-sectional<br>
thickness, porosity, surface tension of water, contact angle, and average pore<br>
diameter of the diffusion medium. The diffusion medium can be selected<br>
whereby the aforementioned diffusion medium properties result in a wicking<br>
coefficient (Dw) that ensures the wickability (Fs) is greater than the liquid water<br>
generation rate (FG) during steady-state operation (i.e., Fs &gt; FG). For example, a<br>
diffusion medium having a wicking coefficient (Dw) greater than about 0.2<br>
gram/cm-s can result in a wickability (Fs) greater than the liquid water generation<br>
rate (FG) of fuel cell system 22 operating at a low current load for the example<br>
 <br>
given above. For another example, a wicking coefficient greater than about 13<br>
g/cm-s can result in a wickability (Fs) higher than the liquid water generation rate<br>
(FG) of fuel cell system 22 operating at a higher current load for the example<br>
given above.<br>
[0047] Referring again to Figure 4, the absorbed and wicked liquid<br>
water can saturate a portion of second diffusion medium 104 near leading edge<br>
120. The saturated portion is held in communication with water transfer<br>
membrane 100 over a liquid communication area, thereby generating liquid water<br>
flux into water transfer membrane 100. The remaining unsaturated volume of<br>
second diffusion medium 104 can absorb the water vapor portion of cathode<br>
effluent stream 42, diffuse the absorbed water vapor throughout the remaining<br>
unsaturated volume and hold the diffused water vapor in communication with<br>
water transfer membrane 100, thereby generating water vapor flux into water<br>
transfer membrane 100. The total water flux of WTD 20 during operation of fuel<br>
cell system 22 is a combination of the liquid water flux and the water vapor flux.<br>
It will therefore be appreciated that because the membrane assemblies of the<br>
prior art do not utilize liquid water to generate water flux, the total water flux of<br>
WTMA 64 can be greater than the total water flux of the membrane assemblies<br>
of the prior art.<br>
[0048] During non-steady-state operation, the liquid water generation<br>
rate (FG) may exceed the wickability (Fs) of second diffusion medium 104 (i.e., FG<br>
&gt; Fs). When this occurs, liquid water can spill over leading edge 120 and be<br>
absorbed by both the first and second faces 122, 124. A buffer of liquid water<br>
 <br>
can be created along and within second diffusion medium 104. The buffer can<br>
expand as it continues to absorb liquid water at a rate faster than the water flux<br>
into the first cathode reactant stream 38, propagating along the length of second<br>
diffusion medium 104, as shown by propagation lines 150 in Figure 4. The buffer<br>
can expand until the entire volume of second diffusion medium 104 is saturated.<br>
The buffering capability of hydrophilic second diffusion medium 104 can thereby<br>
advantageously absorb spikes of liquid water generation that may otherwise be<br>
expelled from a WTD of the prior art. It should be appreciated, however, that<br>
when second diffusion medium 104 is completely saturated and cannot absorb<br>
any more liquid water, the unabsorbed liquid water can be expelled from WTD 20<br>
along with the cathode effluent stream 42.<br>
[0049] The buffering capability of hydrophilic second diffusion medium<br>
104 can advantageously maintain the water flux of WTD 20 at an elevated level.<br>
The buffering capability can advantageously provide for liquid water flux into<br>
water transfer membrane 100 as the buffered liquid water within second diffusion<br>
medium 104 is dispersed to the surface of the water transfer membrane 100.<br>
During periods when a water buffer is present, the water flux is maintained at an<br>
elevated level. The buffering can maintain this water flux at the high level during<br>
periods of time when the liquid water generation rate (FG) is less than the<br>
wickability (Fs) of second diffusion medium 104. Additionally, when the liquid<br>
water generation rate (FG) is less than the wickability (Fs) of second diffusion<br>
medium 104 and greater than the water flux 130 through water transfer<br>
membrane 100, second diffusion medium 104 can increase the liquid water<br>
 <br>
buffer therein up until second diffusion medium 104 becomes saturated. Thus,<br>
during operation of WTD 20, the liquid water buffering of second diffusion<br>
medium 104 can increase or decrease as the operation of the fuel cell system 22<br>
changes.<br>
[0050] Referring now to Figure 6, the theoretical water flux with respect<br>
to time for WTMAs 64 having different initial water buffers is shown. In the graph<br>
of Figure 6, it is assumed that no liquid water is being generated and, as a result,<br>
the buffer in the WTMAs 64 shown decrease over time as water flux is<br>
transferred through water transfer membrane 100 and into the fluid flow on the<br>
opposite side of WTMAs 64. Curves 168, 170, 172 represent the change in<br>
water flux over time for generally identical WTMAs 64 having decreasing initial<br>
buffer volumes which correspond to decreasing liquid communication areas. The<br>
liquid communication area is the surface area of water transfer membrane 100 in<br>
contact with liquid water. A corresponding buffer volume is the saturated volume<br>
of second diffusion medium 104 directly above the liquid communication area. It<br>
is believed that liquid water flux occurs generally uniformly over the liquid<br>
communication area, thereby depleting the buffer generally uniformly. It is further<br>
believed that the liquid communication area remains generally constant as the<br>
buffer is depleted. The uniform depletion can create a period of substantially<br>
steady water flux through WTMAs 64, as represented by the generally flat<br>
elevated portions 168a, 170a, 172a of respective curves 168, 170, 172, as the<br>
buffer volume is depleted. Once the buffer volume is depleted and the liquid<br>
communication area contracts, the water flux begins to decrease, as represented<br>
 <br>
by portions 168b, 170b, 172b of respective curves 168, 170, 172. When the<br>
buffer volume is depleted and the liquid communication area is gone (only water<br>
vapor in contact with water transfer membrane 100), the water flux returns to a<br>
steady-state water flux, as represented by portions 168c, 170c, 172c of<br>
respective curves 168, 170, 172. It can be appreciated from the shape of curves<br>
168, 170, 172 that for decreasing initial liquid communication areas (decreasing<br>
buffer volumes), the time required to change from the elevated water flux rate<br>
(portions 168a, 170a, 172a) to the steady-state water flux rate (portions 168c,<br>
170c, 172c) can decrease, as represented by transition points 174, 175, 176 for<br>
respective curves 168, 170, 172. It should be appreciated that the period of<br>
substantially steady flux at the elevated rate (portions 168a, 170a, 172a) can be<br>
extended by increasing the cross-sectional thickness of second diffusion medium<br>
104, thereby increasing the buffer volume<br>
[0051] Referring now to Figure 7, a theoretical comparison between the<br>
performance of a WTMA 64 according to the present teachings and a prior art<br>
WMTA (having a hydrophobic diffusion medium on both sides) that may occur<br>
due to fluctuations in the operation of fuel cell system 22 between non-steady-<br>
state and steady-state operation are shown. In this theoretical example, time<br>
period A corresponds to a cold start-up of fuel cell system 22 such that a large<br>
quantity of liquid water can be generated and result in providing a significant<br>
buffer to WTMAs 64. Immediately following startup, steady-state operation of<br>
fuel cell system 22 commences. At point B, a non-steady-state operation of fuel<br>
cell system 22 occurs and liquid water is generated that can be utilized to<br>
 <br>
replenish the buffer of WTMAs 64. Point C corresponds to a change in operation<br>
of fuel cell system 22 to a steady-state operation wherein liquid water is not being<br>
generated. At time D, operation of fuel cell system 22 is again changed and<br>
there is a short period of non-steady-state operation and for a short duration of<br>
time liquid water is again being produced. At time E, the fuel cell system 22<br>
again changes operation to a steady-state operation wherein liquid water is no<br>
longer being produced and the steady-state operation continues for the<br>
remainder of the time period shown in Figure 7.<br>
[0052] During the exemplary operation shown in Figure 7, the water<br>
flux for WTMAs 64 is represented by curve 180 and, as shown, undergoes<br>
various responses to the changing operation of fuel cell system 22 between non-<br>
steady-state and steady-state operation. At time A, which immediately follows a<br>
cold start-up, a maximum buffer is created within second diffusion medium 104<br>
and the water flux is at an elevated value. As the buffer is depleted due to<br>
steady-state operation between time periods A and B, the water flux remains<br>
substantially constant until the liquid communication area begins to contract and<br>
the water flux decreases. The water flux trend between times A and B can<br>
generally correspond to that of curve 168 of Figure 6.<br>
[0053] At time period B, the beginning of a non-steady-state operation<br>
results in the creation of liquid water that can replenish the buffer of WTMAs 64<br>
and, as a result, the water flux begins to increase as the liquid communication<br>
area expands. At time C, when fuel cell system 22 returns to steady-state<br>
operation and the generation of liquid water ceases, the water flux remains<br>
 <br>
substantially constant at an elevated value as the buffer of WTMAs 64 is utilized.<br>
Between points D and E, the brief transition to non-steady-state operation and<br>
the generation of liquid water can help to replenish the water buffer and thereby<br>
extend the duration of the substantially constant and elevated water flux that<br>
began at time period C. As the buffer begins to be consumed and the liquid<br>
contact area decreases, the water flux again begins to decrease and approaches<br>
a steady-state water flux wherein the buffer is depleted and no liquid water is<br>
present in WTMAs 64 at time period F. The transition can generally correspond<br>
to one of curves 170, 172 of Figure 6. Thus, as the fuel cell system 22<br>
transitions between steady-state and non-steady-state operation, the presence of<br>
the buffering capability of WTMAs 64 can result in varying degrees of water flux.<br>
[0054] In contrast to the water flux capabilities of WTMAs 64, the water<br>
flux in a theoretical water flux for a prior art WTMA (hydrophobic diffusion<br>
medium on both sides) for the same occurrence events is represented by curve<br>
182. The representative water flux is substantially constant. For purposes of this<br>
comparison, it is assumed that the generation of liquid water during the cold<br>
start-up and during the periods of non-steady-state operation have a negligible<br>
effect on the water flux due to the hydrophobic nature of the diffusion media<br>
helping to purge the liquid water from a prior art WTD, thus preventing the liquid<br>
water having access to the surface of the membrane to enhance the water flux.<br>
Thus, in this situation the water flux of a prior art WTMA is believed to remain<br>
substantially constant.<br>
 <br>
[0055] It should be appreciated that the difference between the areas<br>
beneath curves 180 and 182 represents the water influx increase that can be<br>
realized by WTD 20 utilizing WTMAs 64 according to the present teachings. It<br>
should also be appreciated that the water flux curves of Figures 6 and 7 are<br>
exemplary and theoretical examples and do not reflect actual water flux data<br>
points.<br>
[0056] During operation of WTD 20 within a fuel cell system 22, the<br>
quantity of liquid water relative to the quantity of water vapor in cathode effluent<br>
stream 42 can vary. As a result, the type of water flux (liquid water flux and/or<br>
water vapor flux) during these periods can also vary. Accordingly, it is desirable<br>
that WTD 20 is operable to generate adequate water flux during both steady-<br>
state and non-steady-state operation of fuel cell system 22 and the associated<br>
changes in the ratio of the quantity of liquid water to the quantity of water vapor in<br>
cathode effluent stream 42. Thus, the diffusion mediums of WTMAs 64 (i.e., 104<br>
and 102), can be designed to ensure the water vapor transport.<br>
[0057] As mentioned above, wickability of second diffusion medium<br>
104 can be affected by the porosity, pore size, and the thickness of the diffusion<br>
media. These properties can also affect water vapor diffusion. As the porosity<br>
increases, the resistance for the water vapor transferring to the surface of the<br>
membrane will be decreased, which facilitates the water flux. However, if the<br>
porosity is too large, the mechanical integrity of the diffusion medium will be<br>
compromised. Reducing the diffusion media thickness reduces the distance for<br>
the water vapor to the surface of the membrane, thus enhances the water vapor<br>
 <br>
flux. However reducing the diffusion media thickness might reduce the<br>
membrane surface utilization under land (i.e., membrane area adjacent to<br>
surface 65), and thus could compromise the water vapor flux. In addition,<br>
reducing the diffusion media thickness could also reduce the wickability and<br>
buffering ability of the hydrophilic diffusion media 104.<br>
[0058] It is preferred that diffusion mediums 102 and 104 have porosity<br>
greater than about 70%, preferably in the range of 70-85%, and the thickness of<br>
the diffusion media is less than 0.2 mm, preferably in the range of 0.05-0.1 mm.<br>
To optimize the water vapor transport through the diffusion media, it is preferred<br>
that diffusion mediums 102 and 104 having a pore size in the range of 1-50<br>
micrometers.<br>
[0059] While the present teachings have been described with reference<br>
to specific examples and configurations, it should be appreciated that changes<br>
and deviations from the examples shown can be employed while still being<br>
encompassed by the present teachings and be within the scope of the claims.<br>
For example, it should be appreciated that the configuration of WTD 20 is not<br>
limited to a planar (stacked-plate) configuration. The WTD 20 can be configured<br>
as a tube, spiral wound, or other known WTD configurations that facilitate the<br>
transfer of water between fluid streams passing therethrough. Additionally, while<br>
the properties for second diffusion medium 104 have been stated, it should be<br>
appreciated that other values and/or combinations of properties may achieve a<br>
desired balance between the water vapor flux capabilities and the liquid water<br>
 <br>
flux capabilities for a WTD 20 according to the present teachings. Furthermore,<br>
first diffusion media 102 can by hydrophilic, if desired.<br>

A water transfer device can include first and second flow paths separated<br>
by a water transfer membrane and a hydrophilic diffusion medium. The<br>
hydrophilic diffusion medium is disposed between the water transfer membrane<br>
and the first flow path. Water content of a first fluid stream flowing through the<br>
first flow path is transferred through the diffusion medium and water transfer<br>
membrane and into a second fluid stream flowing through the second flow path.<br>
The hydrophilic diffusion medium is operable to absorb liquid water in the first<br>
fluid stream and hold the absorbed liquid water in contact with the water transfer<br>
membrane. The hydrophilic diffusion medium is also operable to diffuse water<br>
vapor in the first fluid stream and transport the water vapor to the water transfer<br>
membrane. The water transfer membrane transfers the water in contact<br>
therewith to the second fluid stream flowing through second flow path.</td>
