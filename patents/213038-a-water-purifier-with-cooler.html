				<td>This invention relates to a water purifier-cum-cooler.<br>
Water purifiers are as such known in the art.  One of the water purifier comprises a lower and an upper container. Water filter means are provided at the bottom of the upper container inwardly.  Water is manually filled in the upper container which is filtered  by the filtering means  and filtered water  flows to lower container which is used for d drinking purposes.<br>
There are some other water purifiers operating with the help of electric supply.  There are several disadvantages associates with the water purifiers known in the a art.  One of the main disadvantage is that the filters are expensive and maintenance thereof is costly, in addition to cumber-some plumbing requirements.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the rate of filtering is very slow and therefore storing container are required for filtering as well as for storing the filtered water, which can lead to re-contamination of the water.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the purifiers are on-line type which must be fitted on the wall.  Not a single purifier serves both  the purposes, i.e. on-line as well as possible.<br>
Still  another disadvantages  a  that when the filtering means are exhausted or become nonfuntional, it is generally not known to the user and thus the user gets unfit unfiltered water even from the water purifier.<br>
A further disadvantage is that due to the interruption in the<br>
power supply, the purification process does not take place<br>
and also in the remote areas where the power supply is not<br>
there, these purifiers are not useful.<br>
Another disadvantage is that for a tropical country like India<br>
where water cooling is generally essential, purifiers of the<br>
existing art do not provide any means for cooling and this<br>
cooling has to achieved only through extraneous means.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to  propose<br>
a novel water purifier-cum-cooler which obviates the disadvantanges<br>
associated with the prior art and works on the principal of<br>
natural purification process which is aeration.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a water purifier<br>
wherein a plurality of water containers is not required and<br>
use of the water purifier is simple.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a water<br>
purifier wherein no power supply  is required for its operation.<br>
Still another object of this invention isto propose a water purifier provided with auto indication means to show the need for replacement of the purification means (cartridge).<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a water purifier having triple purpose use, for example, it can work on-line, it can be used as portable water purifier and as a storage water filter also.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a water purifier provided with the water cooling means to cool the purified water.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a water purifier comprising a purification/filtering chamber having a   water inlet and provided on a water storage chamber, aeration means being . disposed into said chamber towards the water inlet for causing aeration or diffusion of oxygen in the air with the water, filtering means being disposed into said filtering chamber and opposite to the water inlet, for purifying the water, a water outlet being provided near the bottom of said water storage chamber to get the purified water supply, means being provided around said water storage chamber for cooling the water contained therein.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the water filter has detoxification-cum-precipitation (purification) &amp; sedimentation chamber supported on the water storage chamber for purifying/ filtering the water.  A plurality of wier plates are provided in this chamber towards the water inlet causing aearation therein. The wier plates are provided in the reducing height manner so as to cause a cascade, resulting in or diffusion of oxygen with water in the detoxification-cum-precipitation chamber. A water filter cartridge is disposed in the said chamber opposite to the water inlet side.  Means being provided to indicate the removal of the filter cartridge from the filtering chamber.  A silt removal port is provided in the purification and filtering chamber for removiung the silt as and when required with the help of the screw cap provided at the lower side of the chamber.  An opening is provided in the top when the water filter is not used on -line and used during travel.  An  over-flow outlet is provided near the upper end of the purification chamber for the exit of the excess water as well as gases from said chamber. A float being provided with the water inlet to stop the<br>
supply of water to the purification chamber where the level of water in the water storage chamber reaches upto a pre-determined level and the supply of water to detoxification chamber stops.  A water outlet is provided near the bottom end of said water storage chamber to get the purified water supply  by the user.Means such as thermo electric modules are provided around the water storage chamber for cooling  the purified water contained therein. A water filter according to a preferred embodiment    herein<br>
described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Fig-1.  shows the sectional  view of the water purifier.<br>
Fig-2.  shows the sectional view of the water purifier according<br>
to another embodiment and Fig-3.  shows the sectionaol view of the water purifier according<br>
to yet another embodiment.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig-1 the water purifier has a detoxification-cum-precipitation &amp; sedimentation (purification) chamber (1) supported on the water storage chamber (2) by means of MF (male-female) Fitting system (3). A plurality of wier plates (4) are provided in the detoxification chamber.  A water inlet (5) is provided with the bottom of the detoxification chamber to supply the water therein as and when required.  Wier plates are provided in the said water filter chamber in a reducing height sequence so as to cause cascade, resulting in aeration or diffusion of oxygen woth water.  Aeration that is oxygenation, results in<br>
saturation of water with air/oxygen which a) removes odours and taste causing decomposing organic matter such as phenols and volatile gases and b) converts dissolved irom and manganese compounds int insoluble oxides of these metals which are readily removed by sedimentation.  The generated during aeration open vent (6).<br>
The process of aeration according to other embodyments can also be caused inside the detoxification chamber by providing artificial rain means as shown in Fig.2 or by providing a fountains or spray as shown in Fig.3 Filtering means (7) is provided in the filtering chamber 1 opposit to the water inlet 5 and (8) on the bottom so as to filter &amp; purify the water and convey the same to the water<br>
storage chamber (2). Filtering means (7) comprises a filtering cartage or membrane filter etc.  The filtering cartage consists of (A) DL distributed load prefilter specially design for unique distri-bution of load having-3 - tier filter system of say 20, 40,&amp; 60 microns.  This is for the filteration of the suspended impurties<br>
present in the water, having different particle sizes, (B)<br>
An ion-exchange resin for removal of bacteria and (C) Activated<br>
carbon for absording dissolved gases, removal of odour and colour.<br>
A float (9) is connected to the water inlet (5) such as to stop the water supply to the aeration chamber when the water  level  in the<br>
water storage tank (2) reaches the pre-determined level.  Means are provided around the water storage chamber  2 for cooling the<br>
water contained therein.  The water cooling means (10) comprises either a jacket around it where ice can be placed for cooling<br>
water or thermo electric modules (11) which cool the water by using electric power.  Thermosyphon ports (12) are provided for facilitating the heat removal from the cooling means.  A silt removal port (13) is provided at the bottom of cooling<br>
jacket (10) for removing the waste silt resulting from molten<br>
ice.  An indication mark (14) is provided near the upper end<br>
of the chamber which indicates that the filtering cartridge is<br>
exausted when the witer level in this chamber touches this<br>
indication level mark.  The screw cap (15) is provided at<br>
the top couer of the filtering chamber and when the filter<br>
is used as a portable filter, this screw cap can be opened<br>
for filling ordinary water into it.  An over flow outlet<br>
(6) is provided near the top end of the detoxification chamber<br>
for exit of the excess water from the chamber and for purging<br>
of toxic gases and / or air.<br>
During the use of the purifier, water is filled into the<br>
detoxification chamber and aeration takes place resulting in<br>
detoxification and precipatation is will as<br>
in the detoxification chamber due to the presence of decreasing<br>
night of wier plates.  The water is filtered/purified by the<br>
filtering means and conveyed to the water storage tank when the<br>
water is used by the user the float (9) opens the water inlet<br>
and thus a fresh water supply to the detoxification chamber starts<br>
starts.<br><br><br><br>
