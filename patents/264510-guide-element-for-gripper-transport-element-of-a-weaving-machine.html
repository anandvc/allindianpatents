FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a guide element for a gripper transport element of a weaving machine with first guides and with second guides which together form a form closed, one-open-sided frame for the gripper transport element.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Gripping transport elements are gripper rods or gripper bands that are introduced into a weaving shed from one side, and in the process insert a weft thread. The gripper transport elements move with the gripper, either to the opposite side of the weaving shed or to the middle of the weaving shed where they meet a takeover gripper that is likewise transported from one gripper transport element that takes over the inserted weft thread and holds it or transports it further from the middle of the weaving shed to the opposite side. The gripper transport elements are guided within the weaving shed by means of guide elements. These guide elements are fixed on the weaving slay and are moved with the weaving slay into and out of a weaving shed. Thereby, they enter the lower warp sheet of a weaving shed.<br>
It is known (EP 0 275 479 Bl) to provide hook-shaped guide elements, whose open side faces the reed which is likewise fixed on the weaving slay. The hook-shaped guide elements that guide a gripper transport element, formed as a gripper band, are provided with a guide located on the upper side of the gripper transport element and a guide located at the lower side of the gripper transport element as well as a guide facing away from the open side, which is associated to a side surface of the gripper band. The lower guide and/or the upper guide engage in a longitudinal groove on the upper side, or on the lower side, of the gripper band, so that the sidewall of the longitudinal groove, facing the open side of the guide elements is guided by a guide of the guide elements running perpendicular to the upper side and to the lower side. This guide and the<br><br>
associated guide surfaces of the gripper band that should prevent horizontal movement of the gripper band in the direction towards the open side of the guide elements, and thus towards the reed, are relatively small. Therefore, severe abrasion occurs on the guide elements and, above all, on the gripper transport elements in a relatively short time.<br>
It is also known (WO 94/1 03 64) to provide guide elements that have a C-shape form and are likewise open towards the reed. The gripper transport element that in this case can also be a flexible gripper band is guided against movement in the horizontal direction on the open side of the guide elements by means of two angled sections of the guide elements. The upper side and the lower side of the gripper transport element maintain a distance from the opposite areas of the guide elements. The gripper transport element is provided with a section extending through the open side of the guide elements, which is guided between the opposite sections of the guide elements in the vertical direction. Also with this design type, in particular, in the direction towards the reed, only relatively &gt; small guide surfaces are provided, so that rapid abrasion is expected.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the invention is to provide guide elements of the type mentioned at the beginning, with which, in the horizontal direction, effective guides are enlarged.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved in that, from the first guides associated to the lower side and/or the upper side of the gripper transport element, at least a projection projects inwards of which at least one of its lateral edges completes the second guides.<br><br>
Through one or several of such projections that engage in the longitudinal grooves of the gripper transport element, the size of the guides acting in the horizontal direction can be increased so that further surfaces of the gripper transport element can be used as guide surfaces. Thereby, it is possible to reduce abrasion and to improve the guiding of the gripper transport element. It is possible to provide relatively large guides for the guide elements and accordingly large guide surfaces on the gripper transport elements and, nonetheless, to keep the cross section of the gripper transport elements small or to reduce them in relation to the previous common sizes. A reduction of the cross-section of the gripper transport elements leads to a reduction of the mass to be moved, which is advantageous for high working speeds.<br>
In a design of the invention, it is provided that, the guides essentially form a C-shaped frame. This already allows relatively large guides from basic construction.<br>
Further features and advantageous of the invention are according to the following description of the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and in the dependent claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The guide elements 10 shown in Fig. 1 and 2, which are attached consecutively in a row on a slay feature a C-shaped form and are open towards the reed (not shown), likewise attached to the slay. They serve for guiding a gripper transport element 11 within a shed, which is designed as a gripper rod or as a gripper band.<br>
In Fig. 1 and 2 and in Fig. 4 to 18 the guide elements shown are in their operating position, i.e. as they are attached to a slay and the slay is located in the position in which a gripper transport element is introduced into a shed and is thereby guided by the guide elements. The other positions that they take when the slay is swiveled are not shown.<br>
The guide elements each have a guide 12, which is associated to the upper side of the gripper transport element 11, and a guide 13, which is associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 11. Between these guides 12 and 13, a guide 14 is provided on the closed side of the guide elements 10, which runs<br><br>
perpendicular to the guides 12, 13 in the exemplary embodiment and which is associated to a side surface of the gripper transport element 11. On the opposite side of the guide 14, the guides 12 and 13 transform into sections running at right angles, which form the guides 15, 16, whose height respectively correspond to a third of the guide 14. The guides 12, 13, which are associated to the upper side and the lower side of the gripper transport element 11, and serve as vertical guides, which prevent movement of the gripper transport element 11 in the vertical direction. The guides 14 on the one side and the guides 15, 16 on the other side, serve as horizontal guides, which prevent movement of the gripper transport element 11 in the horizontal direction. The guides 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, form a frame that secures the gripper transport element positively closed against deviations in the horizontal and vertical direction of the motion path and is open on the side facing the reed (not shown). The overall height of the guides 15, 16 with the exemplary embodiment is about one third smaller than that of the guide 14. This poses danger, in that the gripper transport element 11 is exposed to increased abrasion on the side of the guides 15, 16. In order to improve the guides preventing movement in the direction of the open side of the guide elements and increase the overall height above the guides 15, 16, in this direction, in the exemplary embodiment, the guide 13 is provided with a projection 17 which protrudes in an inward manner and which engages in a longitudinal groove of the gripper transport element 11. The projection 17, which in the view according to Fig. 1 has a preferably rectangular shape, serves as a complementary horizontal guide with its side edges. For example, the height of the projections 17 is selected such that the added height of the projections 17 and the guides 15, 16 corresponds at least approximately to the height of the guide 14.<br>
With an exemplary embodiment, a gripper transport element 11 is designed such that, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3, i.e., it features an enlargement 18 extending<br><br>
over the entire length or over a part A of its length, which remains outside the guide elements 10. In this case, it is possible to design the sections of the guide elements on the opposite outside of the guides 15, 16 likewise as guides, so that the guides at disposal for the horizontal guide are further enlarged. In this case, two longitudinal grooves are located between the enlargement 18 and the part of the gripper transport element 11 guided within the guide elements 10, i.e. one longitudinal groove on the upper side and the other longitudinal groove on the lower side. The enlargement 18 can be a guide part that receives a gripper and on which the gripper transport element is fixed.<br>
The guide element 40 shown in Fig. 4 together with a multitude of guide elements 10 associated in a row successively serves for guiding a gripper transport element 41, in particular, which is designed as a gripper band. The gripper transport element 41 has an essentially flat, rectangular shape, so that it is more bendable in a horizontal axis than in a vertical axis. The gripper transport element 41 is thus well suitable to be wrapped around a drive wheel that rotates back and forth about a horizontal axis. The guide element 40 is provided with a guide 42 on the upper side of the gripper transport element 41 and a guide 43 running parallel to it, associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 11. The guide element 40 is open on the side facing the reed (not shown), so that the gripper transport element 41 protrudes a bit above this side.<br>
On the closed side of the guide element 40, between the guide 42 and the guide 43, a guide 44 is provided, which runs perpendicularly to the guides 42, 43 and is associated to one side surface of the gripper transport element 41. In order to establish a horizontal guide, against movement in the direction towards the open side of the guide element, two projections 45, 46, project in an inward manner<br><br>
from the guide 43, which feature a rectangular shape when viewed in the longitudinal direction of the gripper transport element 41 and engage in two longitudinal grooves of the gripper transport element 41. The two longitudinal grooves and the two projections 45, 46 in the exemplary embodiment have the same dimensions and are associated in the same distance from the longitudinal middle plane of the gripper transport element 41. The height of the two projections, starting from the guide 43, corresponds in the exemplary embodiment at least to half of that of the guide 44 so that on the side facing away from the guide 44, due to the added heights of the projections 45 and 46, a guide is provided which at least approximately corresponds to the height of the guide 44.<br>
The embodiment of guide elements 50 according to Fig. 5 corresponds in principle to the design of the guide elements 40 according to Fig. 4. The lower side of the gripper transport element 51 is associated to a guide 53, from which two projections 55, 56 project in an inward manner. In addition, the projections 57, 58 associated to the upper side of the gripper transport element 51, project from the guide 52 in an inward manner, which once again enlarges the horizontal guides. In this manner, it is particularly easy to obtain an overall height of the horizontal guides, which prevents movement in the direction towards the open side of the guide elements 50, which is larger than the height of the guide 54, which is associated to a side surface of the gripper transport element 51.<br>
Gripping transport elements in the form of gripper rods or gripper bands are driven by means of drive wheels that are provided with gear teeth, which engage in the holes 59 of a row of holes on the gripper rod or of the gripper band. The gripper transport element 51 according to Fig. 5, in its longitudinal middle, is<br><br>
provided with of a row of holes 59, which extend from the upper side to the lower side of the gripper transport element 51. The projections 55, 56 as well as 57, 58 are located outside of the areas of the row of holes, so that the holes 59 can extend over the entire height of the gripper transport element 51, i.e., are located in a section that is not weakened by a longitudinal groove or the like. The same also applies to the gripper transport element 41, which is provided in the section between the longitudinal grooves determined for the projections 45, 46 with the holes of the row of holes. In a modified embodiment, it is provided that, the depth of the holes corresponds to the height of the projections 45.<br>
The guide elements 10' shown in Fig. 6 and 7 differ from the guide elements 10 according to Fig. 1 and 2, additionally only because a projection 61 is provided on the guide 12' associated to the upper side of the gripper transport element 11'. In the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 6 and 7 the projection 61 is associated opposite the projection 17. Moreover, it has the same dimensions. In a modified embodiment, it is provided that, the projections 17 and 61 in the transverse direction (transverse to the gripper transport element 11) are associated in a displaced manner. In a further modified embodiment, it is provided that, the projections 17, 61 also feature different dimensions.<br>
As shown in the embodiment according to Fig. 8 (which essentially corresponds to the embodiment according to Fig. 4), the projections 85 and 86 for the guide element 80 must not be located symmetrically to the middle longitudinal axis of the gripper transport element 81, as in the embodiment according to Fig. 4, and also must not have the same dimensions based on the width and the depth.<br><br>
Fig. 9 shows an embodiment for guide elements 90, with which a projection 96 protrudes in an inward manner from one of the guides 92 located on the upper side of a gripper transport element 91, which is parallel to guide 94 running perpendicular to the guide 92 located on the open side of the guide element 90. This projection 96 is displaced from a projection 95, which protrudes in an inward manner from the guide 93, which is associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 91.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an embodiment of a guide element 10", which is a modification of the guide element 10 according to Fig. 1 and 2. With this embodiment it is provided that the gripper transport element 11" features an upper inclined guide surface, on the open side of the guide element 10" and thus an edge area facing the reed (not shown), i.e., a guide surface that runs inclined to the horizontal and to the vertical, for example below 45". The outer edge of the section with the guide 1.5' of the guide element 10", which is associated to this guide surface of the gripper transport element 11", is likewise inclined, preferably parallel to the guide 15'. The upper edge of the guide element 10", which is associated to the guide 12 for the upper side of the gripper transport element 11", likewise runs slightly inclined upwards in the direction towards the open side. The transition between the outer edge associated to the guide 15' and guide 12 is slightly rounded. It forms the highest point on the guide element 10". This design has advantages when penetrating a warp sheet, since the danger level that a warp-thread will be "caught" is relatively low.<br>
The gripper transport element 11" according to Fig. 1 to 3 can be provided with an enlargement 18, which extends over a part A of its axial length.<br>
In Fig. 11 an exemplary embodiment is shown, which is a modification of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 10. As visible in Fig. 11 the projection<br><br>
17' of the guide element 10'" is somewhat wider. The gripper transport element 11" is shown in the section of its enlargement 18. The guide element 10'" in the section of guide 13 associated to its lower side of the gripper transport element 11" is elongated by means of a projection 25 beyond the open side, located between the guides 15', 16. The projection 25, which runs out sharp, forms a guide 26 for the lower side of the enlargement 18 with its upper side and supports the enlargement 18 against torsional forces.<br>
The guide element 50' of Fig. 12 differs from the guide element 50 of Fig. 5 in that it is only provided with one projection 58, which is associated to the upper side of a gripper transport element 51'. The guide element 50' can be used to guide a gripper transport element 51 according to Fig. 5 or also a gripper transport element 51' according to Fig. 12.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 13 corresponds to the embodiment according to Fig. 5. The difference is that the guide element 50" on the open side is provided with a shoulder 25 that forms a complementary guide 26 for the frame that lies outside the other guides and supports the lower side of the gripper transport element 51 projecting from the frame. The guide element 90' of Fig. 14 corresponds in principle to the guide element 90 of Fig. 1. In addition in this embodiment a shoulder 25 is provided, associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 91, which forms a guide 26 for the gripper transport element 91' outside the open side of the frame surrounded by the guides 92, 93, 94, 95, 96. As seen in Fig. 14, the projection 96' protrudes from the guide surface 92 that is associated to the upper side of the gripper transport element 91', downwards beyond half of the thickness of the gripper transport element 91', so that guides are formed by opposite surface of the projections 95, 96', which are higher than the guide 94.<br><br>
In Fig. 15 and 16, guide elements 10 are shown, which differ from the exemplary embodiments according to Fig. 1 and 2 only in that a shoulder 25 is additionally provided, that forms a guide 26 that is associated to the enlargement 18' of Fig. 15 and the enlargement 18" of Fig. 16. As Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 further show, the enlargement 18 must not feature the same thickness as the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2 in the rest part of the gripper transport element 11. Moreover, the enlargement 18' can feature a smaller thickness or the enlargement 18" a larger thickness. When the enlargement 18", as in the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 16, is guided by means of the guide 26 and the essentially perpendicularly running outer part of the sections of the guide element 10 forming the guide 15, then the enlargement 18" is supported in both directions according to torsion about the longitudinal axis.<br>
The guide element 10 of the embodiment according to Fig. 17 and 18 corresponds, again in principle, to the guide element 10 according to Fig. 1 and 2. In addition, a recess 28 is provided in the guide 14 opposite the open side, which is associated to a longitudinal rib 29 of the gripper transport element 11. Thereby, it is possible, in the gripper transport element 11, in the section of its neutral plane (when bending about a horizontal axis), to increase the number of reinforcement inserts of carbon fiber or aramid fiber or glass fiber or the like and to provided a larger width therefore.<br>
In Fig. 19, a guide element 80' is shown, which essentially corresponds to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 8. Adjoining the projection 86, a shoulder 25 that protrudes outwards is provided, which forms a guide for the lower side of the gripper transport element 81.<br>
The measures described for the individual exemplary embodiments can obviously also be used with the other exemplary embodiments. Thus, it is also possible<br><br>
with the exemplary embodiments according to Fig. 1 and 2 or 17, 18, to provide shoulders 25 with a guide 26, which supports a section of a gripper transport element located outside of the guide element. Likewise, recesses 28 according to Fig. 17 and 18 can be provided in all exemplary embodiments, which guide a longitudinal rib of the gripper transport element.<br>
In the embodiments according to Fig. 1 to 18, the guide elements feature both horizontal guides as well as vertical guides. In a modified embodiment, it is provided that, the guide elements are divided into individual guide elements, which respectively only exercise one or two guiding functions. For example, the guide element 40 according to Fig. 4 can be divided into three guide elements featuring a guide 42 associated with the upper side of the gripper transport element 41, a guide 44 associated to the side surface of the gripper transport element 41 and the guide 43 associated to the lower side of the gripper transport element 41. The projections 45, 46 are respectively own guide elements associated to the guide element with the above-mentioned guides 42, 43, 44 associated at a lateral distance. In a modified embodiment, the guiding functions of the guides 42, 43 or 44 are respectively transferred to the own guide elements. In most cases, nonetheless, guide elements that contain all guides are preferred, since the number of guide elements and contacts with warp-threads are fewer.<br>
The invention is not limited to the shown and described exemplary embodiments. Moreover, in particular modification regarding the number and/or the size of the projections that protrude from the guides can be provided.<br><br>
