PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel plant growth regulator compositions and to the use thereof. More speC1fically, it relates to compositions comprising mepiquat borate compounds and to methods of plant growth regulation, particularly cotton plant growth regulation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Plant growth regulators (PGRs) affect growth and differentiation of plants. More speC1fically, various PGRs can, for example, reduce plant height, stimulate seed germination, induce flower¬ing, darken leaf coloring, minimize lodging of cereals, change the rate of plant growth, and modify the timing and effiC1ency of fruiting.<br>
PGRs are recognized as an essential tool in modern cotton produc¬tion.  Mepiquat (IUPAC name: N,N-dimethylpiperidinium), the first widely accepted PGR for cotton plants, is typically applied to cotton plants in the form of its chloride salt, i.e., mepiquat chloride (the chlorine salt of mepiquat), by foliar application.<br>
The most visible effect of mepiquat chloride PGRs on cotton plants is the reduction of overall plant height, reduction of the distance between nodes, and reduction of plant width. In turn, light penetration to the lower leaves of the plant is enhanced, promoting lower boll retention and development.<br>
A related benefit that is often achieved is an increase in the weight of harvestable cotton bolls. Another highly desirable benefit that is often achieved by using mepiquat chloride PGRs is • "earliness" of boll opening. See, for example, Khafaga, Angew. Botanik 57, 257-265 (1983); Sawan et al., J. Agronomy &amp; Plant SC1ence, 154, 120-128 (1985); Ray, DeC1phering PGRs, Cotton Farm¬ing, June 1997, 18-20; Cotton Production, 1995 Delta Agricultural Digest, 22-24, (published by Argus Agronomics, a division of Ar¬gus, Inc.); US 3,905,798, US 4,447,255; Pix OffiC1al Handbook.<br>
As discussed in US 3,905,798 to Zeeh et al., all of the known mepiquat salts are hygroscopic solids.  Accordingly, dry flowable forms of mepiquat plant growth regulators must be prepared by using various solid carriers such as clays, fertilizers, or the like, or by employing speC1al preparation procedures and packag-<br><br>
ing' that isolate the solids from any humidity in the environment. Further, EP-A 710 071 teaches a process for processing and drying hygroscopic mepiquat chloride for solids formulations and in par¬ticular for the production of tablets.<br>
Furthermore, EP-A 573 177 for example discloses an anhydrous pro¬cess for manufacturing mepiquat chloride, wherein the resulting product must be packed in a water-soluble polyvinylalcohol pouch to protect it against moisture and dissolution as a result of water vapor being taken up.<br>
WO 09/09627 describes the production of water-dispersible granules of mepiquat chloride." Ways are shown of overcoming the hydrgroscopic problems with the aid of selected auxiliaries, e.g., synthetic calC1um silicates, binders and mixtures of various sodium sulfonates and/or carboxylates.<br>
In the manufacturing environment, the hygroscopic nature of the mepiquat salts is undesirable for various reasons. In particular, moisture causes the mepiquat chloride salt compositions to disas¬soC1ate into ions, which in turn tend to have a relatively low pH. The net result is a relatively strong corrosive effect when the moist solids are stored for any substantial period of time. Furthermore higher concentrations of chloride anions in water show strong corrosive effects towards many steel types and me-talls. Accordingly, speC1al manufacturing processes and appara¬tuses are typically employed in order to overcome the corrosive nature of the mepiquat salts.<br>
Further, monoborates of mepiquat, espeC1ally monoborates, mono-borate chelates or complexes, are used as toners for electropho¬tography (cf, e.g., JP-A 05/265257; JP-A 02/166713). Aliphatic, open chain quatery ammonium monoborates are described in Electro -chim. Acta 39, 18 (1994); Z. Naturforsch. B (Chim. SC1.) 48, 7 (1993); Z. Naturforsch. B (Anorg. Chem. Org. Chem.) 33 B, 20 (1978); J. Nonmetals 2 (2), 103 (1974); JP-A 89/322006; US 3,403,304). These known ammonium monoborates are used as electrolytes, catalytic polymerisation agents, flame retardants or boron-bioC1des. However no applications are described of these compounds in the agricultural sector.<br>
Although the hygroscopic and corrosive nature of the mepiquat chloride salts is a known problem, no alternative mepiquat compounds have been proposed that are not hygroscopic or corro-i sive. The search for such compounds is complicated by the re¬quirement that modifications to the compound to decrease its cor¬rosive and hygroscopic properties, must not substantially harm<br><br>
the plant growth regulating properties of the compound. Other¬wise, the utility of mepiquat would be eliminated or substan¬tially impaired.<br>
In view of such biological activity considerations and further in view of the uniformly hygroscopic nature of all known mepiquat salts, no modified mepiquat compounds which minimize or eliminate these problems while still retaining high biological activity have been proposed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides novel mepiquat plant growth regu¬lator compositions which have improved levels of corrosivity and hygroscopiC1ty. The novel mepiquat plant growth regulator com¬positions of the invention can be readily prepared from the com¬merC1ally available technical mepiquat chloride inter alia by electrochemical ion exchange processes or by quaternization of N-methylpiperidine with dimethylcarbonate as starting material.<br>

'he mepiquat borate, partial borate and mixed borate salts of he invention have improved levels of corrosivity and hygroscop-C1ty. They are biologically active compositions having plant rowth regulating properties comparable or superior to mepiquat :hloride. The novel mepiquat borates can readily be prepared ac-:ording to another aspect of the invention by converting salts uch as mepiquat halides, carbonates, bicarbonates, sulfates, bi-ulfates, mono-C1-C4-alkylsulfates or formiates, espeC1ally mepi-[uat halides, sulfates, monomethylsulfate and formiates, prefer-.bly mepiquat chloride into basic mepiquat salts such as mepiquat tydroxide by novel electrochemical processes. The abovementioned, iasic mepiquat salt is then reacted with boric aC1d to form the iew salts of the mepiquat borate type, corresponding to the :ormula II and with regard to the compounds of formula III, the ibovementioned basic mepiquat salt is reacted with boric aC1d and )ther compounds. The conversion of the abovementioned mepiquat (alts to mepiquat hydroxide can be conveniently conducted accord-.ng to yet another aspect of the invention using any of various .on exchange processes. Preferably, mepiquat salts such as mepi-[uat halides, carbonates, bicarbonates, sulfates, bisulfates, iono-C1-C4-alkylsulfates or formiates, espeC1ally mepiquat lalides, sulfates, monomethylsulfate and formiates, preferably tepiquat chloride are converted to mepiquat hydroxide using ilectrochemical ion exchange processes and apparatus.<br>
furthermore, the novel mepiquat borates can readily be prepared iccording to another aspect of the invention by converting mepi-juat chloride directly into mepiquat borates by a novel electro¬chemical process which will be described later on in detail.<br>
Che mepiquat borates can also be prepared using mepiquat lydroxide, bicarbonate or carbonate as educts by classic Inorganic reactions. Preferentially the'abovementioned novel carbonates or bicarbonates can be obtained by quaternization of S-methylpyridine and/or piperidine with dimethylcarbonate in the neat, preferentially under pressure and by using methanol and/or water as solvents. Mepiquat carbonate and/or bicarbonate are then reacted with boric aC1d and/or corresponding borate salts. As an option, basic salts of agriculturally acceptable metals, which<br><br>
were mentioned for formula III, espeC1ally their basic metal hydroxides or carbonates can be used.<br>
In all the abovementioned cases a chelate or complex forming moiety A can be added to get compositions comprising compounds of the formula I to III with v ^ zero.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the compositions comprising the mepiquat borate, partial borate, and mixed borate salts (collectively referred to hereinafter as "mepiquat borates") are substantially free of chlorine or other halide ions.<br>
Typical values of halide traces and halide contaminations are in a range of from 0 to 1 wt.%, preferentially of from 0 to 0.5 wt.% based on mepiquat borates (calc. dry).<br>
It is also preferred for the mepiquat borates of the invention to have a pH in aqueous solution between about 5 and about 9 preferably approximately neutral.<br>
Preferred mepiquat borates of the invention include suffiC1ent boron for the ratio of elemental boron to mepiquat cation to be between about 1:2 and about 20:1, more preferably between about 2:1 and about 20:1, espeC1ally preferably between about 2:1 and about 10:1, in particular between about 3:1 and about 10:1. At least in some cases, it is believed that the borate anions or moieties, complexed or assoC1ated with the mepiquat cation, are capable of potentiating or otherwise enhanC1ng the plant growth regulating properties of mepiquat, as disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent application entitled "POTENTIATED MEPIQUAT PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR COMPOSITIONS" by Kenneth E. Fersch, Scott W. Gibson, and David G. Hobbs, PCT/EP/98/05149 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The novel mepiquat plant growth regulator compositions of the invention are particularly desirable because of their non-hygroscopic and non-corrosive properties as discussed previously. In addition, borate fertilizers in the form of simple borate salts such as SOLUBOR® (U.S. Borax Company) (Na2B80i3-4 H20) have long been applied to plants such as cotton.<br>
Boron is also a component of complex fertilizer mixtures or micronutrient preparations such as Basfoliar® or Nutribor® (BASF AG). Accordingly, preferred mepiquat borates of the invention introduce no new chemical moieties into the environment or into a crop such as cotton. Indeed, the quantity of mepiquat<br><br>
cation applied to crops such as cotton by preferred compositions of the invention, is comparable to or generally the same as applied by conventional mepiquat chloride PGR formulations, while the quantity of boron applied to crops is below the quantity applied by conventional boron fertilizers and above quantities applied by boron micronutrient components of other fertilizers.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The mepiquat borate compositions of the invention, in their vari¬ous forms, can be generally referred to as "salts", "coordination compounds" or "complexes". Similarly, the cationic and anionic speC1es thereof can be referred to as "ions" or "complex ions". As is apparent to those skilled in the art, the theoretical differences between a "compound", a "coordination compound", a "complex", and a "salt", are generally understood as being a matter of degree, only; and similarly, the theoretical differ¬ence, if any, between an "ion" and a "complex ion" is generally understood as being a matter of degree. This is particularly true in the case of inorganic compositions and complexes based boron-oxygen containing anionic moieties. Accordingly, the term "salt" is used herein to include "salts", "coordination compounds" and "complexes"; and the terms "ion", "cation", and "anion" are used herein to include "ions" and "complex ions". The term "agriculturally acceptable" is used herein to include agricultural, industrial and residential uses which are compatible with plants.<br>
The term "mepiquat borate salt" as used herein, is intended to include salts, coordination compounds, and complexes, of mepiquat (N,N-dimethylpiperidinium) cations with borate anions.  The term "mepiquat partial borate salt" as used herein is intended to include coordination compounds, complexes and salts, of mepiquat cations with mixed anionic speC1es including both borate anions and at least one other type of anion which does not contain boron. The term "mixed mepiquat borate salt" as used herein, is intended to include coordination compounds, complexes, and salts, of mixed cationic speC1es including both mepiquat cations and at least one other type of cation different from the mepiquat  cations, with borate anions alone, or with mixed anionic speC1es including both borate anions and at least one other type of anion which does not contain boron.<br>
The term "borate" as used herein is intended to include hydrated  and anhydrous anionic speC1es based on boron-oxygen compounds, in various forms including chain and ring structures, including oligomorphic and polymorphic forms thereof, e.g., double rings.<br><br>
As is generally known to those skilled in the art, the particular form or structure of a borate anion or polyanion, can readily change depending upon the chemical environment of the anionic speC1es. In particular, the structures of many borate anions are known to vary under different conditions of pH and/or depending on whether the speC1es is present as a solid, or in aqueous solution.<br>
In particular, borate anions in aqueous solution at pH's in the range of 7-9 tend to be present in the form of rings and double rings. Boron NMR studies show that, depending on the concentra¬tion, the abovementioned borate anions are espeC1ally equilibrium mixtures of mono-, tri- and pentaborate structures (see therefore C.G. Salentine, Inorg. Chem., 22, 3920 (1983).<br>
On the other hand, at pH's below about 6, the borate anions tend to be present in the form of boric aC1d or as chains having the formula [B02]q~, in which q is typically greater than 1. This happens espeC1ally in the heat, for example under the conditions of spraydrying and of condensations and removal of water. However, under usual spraydrying conditions (inlet temperature of from 50 to 200°C, espeC1ally of from 80 to 150°C) tri- and pentaborate anionic structures are mainly obtained.<br>
Moreover, the various anionic borate speC1es typically hydrate, i.e., react and/or complex with water, rapidly and lose their original structure in aqueous solution with the result that the anionic structure in aqueous solution for a particular borate may not be the same as the anionic structure in crystalline or amorphous non-aqueous form since less complex anions can readily combine during a crystallization process.<br>
In a like manner, various polyols and a-hydroxy carboxylic aC1ds, and also various polyamines, are known to form very stable com¬plexes (including chelates), exceedingly rapidly, with borates in • aqueous and nonaqueous solutions. Preferably used as complexing/ chelating agents are for example the following compounds A.<br>
In detail according to formula I A, means a molecule from the  class of 1-hydroxycarboxylic aC1ds, e.g., lactic aC1d, mandelic aC1d or malic aC1d; mono- or oligohydroxymono-, di- or tri¬carboxylic aC1ds, e.g., tartaric aC1d or C1tric aC1d; glycols, espeC1ally viC1nal glycoles, e.g., 1,2-propylenglycol, 2,3-buty-lenglycol; alcohols, e.g., ethanol, pentanol or benzyl alcohol;  mono-, di- or tricarboxylic aC1ds, e.g., acetic aC1d, oxalic aC1d or benzoic aC1d; amino alcohols, e.g. ethanolamine or diethanol-amine; poivalcohols and sugar and their derivatives such as sugar<br><br>
alcohols, polyhydroxycarboxylic aC1ds, e.g., glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, glucose and fructose or glucoronic aC1d; and deriva¬tives of the abovementioned substance classes, e.g., ether or ester derivatives which may form at least one protic-nucleophilic coordination to a boron atom, e.g., ethers or esters with an additional amino, hydroxy or carboxylic aC1d function.<br>
Furthermore, the term "borate" as used herein, is intended to also include hydrates, polyol complexes, carboxylic aC1d com¬plexes and amine complexes which are readily derived from borates and hydrated borates.  Borate chemistry is discussed in greater detail in various texts known to the skilled artisan including Cotton and Wilkinson, "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, A Comprehensive Text", Section 8-5, pages 229-233 (Third Edition, 1972); and Hollemann-Wiberg, "Lehrbuch der Anorg. Chemie", 81-90. Aufl., page 631 et seq. , "Boron, Metallo-Boron compounds and Boranes", IntersC1ences Publishers, John Wiley and Sons, 1964 and Wolfgang Kliegel, "Bor in Biologie, Medizin and Pharmazie", Springer Verlag, 19 80 - which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The compounds I to III of the present invention comprise at least one boron-oxygen-boron fragment as structural element.<br>
The mepiquat borates of the invention can be readily prepared from known mepiquat salts including halides and the like, which in turn can be prepared according to known processes disclosed, for example, in US 3,905,798 to Zeeh et al., which is incorpo¬rated herein by reference. Advantageously, the mepiquat borates of the invention are prepared by converting a readily available mepiquat salt, preferably mepiquat chloride, into a basic mepi¬quat salt such as mepiquat hydroxide and thereafter neutralizing the basic mepiquat salt with boric aC1d and optionally blending with borates of agriculturally useful salts, like sodium, potassium, ammonium, calC1um, magnesium or zinc in order to form the new compounds of formula I.<br>
Furthermore basic salts of the abovementioned agriculturally useful cations, for example oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or hydrogencarbonates of sodium, potassium, calC1um, magnesium, zinc or ammonium, can be used in combinations with boric aC1d or other borate salts.<br>
The conversion of mepiquat salts, e.g., mepiquat halides, carbon¬ates, bicarbonates, sulfates, bisulfates, mono-C1-C4-alkylsulfates or formiates, espeC1ally mepiquat halides, sulfates, monomethyl-sulfate and formiates, preferably mepiquat chloride, to mepiquat<br><br>
hydroxide can be conveniently conducted according to the inven¬tion using any of various chemical or electrochemical ion ex¬change processes, including ion exchange processes using various ion exchange resins, and by electrochemical ion exchange processes. Preferably, mepiquat chloride is converted to mepiquat hydroxide using electrochemical processes and apparatus.<br>
Currently, electrochemical processes employing microporous membrane separators, are preferred processes for the preparation of mepiquat hydroxide. Such electrochemical processes can be conducted in various ways using various known apparatus. For example, bipolar electrodialysis processes can be carried out by method similar to those described in H. Stratmann et al., Chemtech (6)(1993) pages 17-24, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
According to this process, a bipolar electrodialysis cell is fitted with an alternating arrangement of a plurality of bipolar membranes and a plurality of anion exchange membranes. The alter¬nating arrangement of the two membrane types gives rise to a plurality of "n" aC1d and "n" base zones in which "n" can range from 1 to about 300. The membranes are supported by sealing spacers spaced about 0.05 to about 3 mm apart.<br>
The bipolar electrodialysis process can be conducted in the pres¬ence of water in either a basic mode (employing a basic solution including, e.g., sodium hydroxide) or in an aC1dic mode (employ¬ing an aC1dic solution including, e.g., sulfuric aC1d). In the basic mode, nickel anodes and steel cathodes are preferred. In the aC1dic mode preference is given to DSA (dimensionally stable anodes, known from chlorine-alkali-electrolysis, i.e. titanium metal mesh anodes with various mixed oxides, e.g. the transition metals Ir, Ru, Rh, etc.) or Pt anodes and steel or Pt cathodes. The current densities used are in the range between 1 and 14 A/dm2, espeC1ally between 4 and 10 A/dm2. The reaction temperature -lies between 10 and 60°C.<br>
The process is started by pumping a dilute, e.g., 1 to 60 wt.%, preferably 5 to 30 wt.% strength mepiquat salt solution, espeC1ally mepiquat halide solution, preferably mepiquat chloride solution through the set of base zones. At the same time, dilute aC1d (e.g., 0.5 wt.% strength hydrochloric aC1d) is pumped through the aC1d zones. When an electric field is applied, chloride ions migrate across the anion exchange membrane, in accordance with the direction of the field, from the base compartments to the aC1d compartments. At the same time water is dissoC1ated in the bipolar membranes into H+ (aC1d compartments)<br><br><br>
and OH" (base compartments). The pH in the aC1d loop can be kept aC1dic or neutral or basic by adding a base. Preferably the aC1d loop is kept aC1dic. The concentration of the salts formed in the aC1d loop usually was in the range of 1 to 35 wt.%. The bipolar  electrodialysis treatment results in a 1 to 60 wt.%, preferably 1 to 35 wt.%, espeC1ally 5 to 30 wt.% strength mepiquat hydroxide solution which is largely chloride-free.<br>
It is espeC1ally advantageous when the borates of formula I  are synthesized directly without the isolation of the mepiquat hydroxide stage. In doing so the base loop yield of the bipolar electrodialysis arrangement described above is treated during the electrochemical reaction with appropriate quantities of boric aC1d (crystalline or concentrated boric aC1d solution), boron -containing oxides, and optionally in the presence of agricultur¬ally useful metal hydroxides, metal oxides, metal carbonates, metal bicarbonates, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate or mixtures thereof, so that the compounds of formula I are formed directly. For this purpose an aqueous solution of mepiquat halide, espeC1ally mepiquat chloride, having a concentration of 1 to 60 wt.%, preferably having a concentra¬tion of 1 to 35 wt.%, espeC1ally having a concentration of 5 to 3 0 wt.%, is charged into the base loop of the bipolar electro¬dialysis system. A dilute solution (about 0.5 wt.%) of an aC1d, base or alternatively of a mineral salt, espeC1ally hydrogen chloride, sulfuric aC1d, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium chloride or potassium chloride, preferably hydrogen chlo¬ride or sodium chloride, are charged into the aC1d loop so that there is adequate initial conductivity. By applying an electric current to the electrodes the chloride ions migrate in accordance with the electric field selectively through the anion exchange membrane into the aC1d loop, while multivalent anions and cations are held back. At the same time, likewise due to the influence of the electric field, water dissoC1ates in the bipolar membranes into H+ (aC1d loop) and OH" (base loop). The liberated hydroxide ions deprotonate the boric aC1d so that the compounds of for¬mula I are formed directly.<br>
In this process the pH in the aC1d loop is maintained in the  range of 1 to 14, prefereably in the range of 6 to 9, by addition of base. All materials known from the literature can be used for the electrodes. The current densities lie in the range of 1 to 14 A/dm2, preferably between 4 and 10 A/dm2, and espeC1ally between 4 and 6 A/dm2.<br><br>
The concentration of the salts formed in the aC1d loop usually lies in the range of 1 to 35 wt.%, preferably in the range of 5 to 15 wt.%. The reaction is carried out at 10 to 60°C, preferably at 30 to 50°C. The mepiquat borate salts obtain at most 1 wt.%, and preferably 0.5 wt.% chloride, based on mepiquat borate salt (calc. dry).<br>
An alternative electrochemical process for synthesizing mepiquat hydroxide from the corresponding salt, espeC1ally chloride can generally be carried out employing the ion exchange electrolysis process as generally described in GB-A 106693 0 (Monsanto).Ac¬cording to this process, a conventional plate/frame electrolytic cell is converted into a bipartite cell by a cation exchange membrane (for example a Nafion® cation exchange membrane) being placed between the anode and the cathode. The preferred anode material used preferably comprises DSA electrodes and the preferred cathode material used is alloy steel (RA4) or nickel.<br>
The anolyte pumping C1rcuit is supplied with a 5-60 wt.% strength aqueous mepiquat chloride solution. The catholyte pumping C1rcuit is charged with, for example, a 0.5-1 wt.% strength mepiquat hy¬droxide solution.<br>
The electrolytic process causes selective transfer of mepiquat cations across the cation exchange membrane in the direction of the catholyte, where simultaneous cathodic electrolysis of water generates hydrogen and OH" ions. The latter, together with the mepiquat cation transferred from the anolyte, form the desired mepiquat hydroxide. The anode reaction takes the form of electro¬lytic oxidation of chloride ions to elemental chlorine which is continuously removed by continuous scrubbing of the anolyte.<br>
Furthermore the mepiquat borates of the invention can be readily prepared from mepiquat carbonates and bicarbonates which are novel. They in term can be prepared by quaternazing piperidin and N-methyl-piperidine respectively with dimethylcarbonate. The me¬piquat carbonates and bicarbonates can be used directly - without forming the mepiquat hydroxide - to from the mepiquat borates.<br>
The novel mepiquat borate salts, partial borate salts, and mixed borate salts, are then prepared in accordance with the invention by reacting the basic mepiquat salt (e.g. mepiquat hydroxide, mepiquat carbonate, mepiquat bicarbonate) with boric aC1d or boric oxide, or with an agriculturally acceptable borate salt and/or a chelating reactant (see the definition for A). Such borate salts include any of various known borate salts including, sodium borate, sodium metaborate, sodium triborate, sodium penta-<br><br>
borate, polyborates, borax, borax decahydrate, borax penta-hydrate, disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (commerC1ally available as SOLUBOR® from U.S.Borax, ValenC1a, CA) and the like. The quantity of boric aC1d or borate salt is selected to provide the desired ratio of elemental boron to mepiquat cation in the final mepiquat borate. Preferably, the mepiquat borates of the inven¬tion comprise a weight ratio of mepiquat to boron (calculated based on elemental boron and the mepiquat cation) of at least about 2:1 to 1:20, espeC1ally at least 1:2 to 1:20, preferably at least about 1:3 to 1:10. On the other hand, the quantity of elemental boron can be significantly greater than that of the mepiquat cation, and can range up to 1:50 or higher. It is also possible to blend the compounds of the formula II with additional boron sources, like Solubor® or Borax, or with mixtures of boric aC1d and basic salts of agriculturally acceptable metals, for example oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of sodium, potassium, calC1um or magnesium, to obtain the compounds of the formula III.<br>
Currently preferred mepiquat borates have a boron to mepiquat ratio of between about 2:1 and about 10:1 (calculated based on elemental boron and the mepiquat cation).<br>
The boron to mepiquat ratio is controlled by incorporating non-borate anionic reactants or borate-complexing compounds during the reaction of the basic mepiquat salt with boric aC1d, or with a borate salt; or by including excess borate anionic materials in the composition either as neutralized boric aC1d, or directly in the form of an agriculturally acceptable borate salt. Suitable chelating agents or borate-complexing compounds include polyols, particularly lower alkyl glycols and sugars; a-hydroxy carboxylic aC1ds such as lactic aC1d and mandelic aC1d; 2,3-dihydroxy-carboxylic aC1ds such as tartaric aC1d or aC1ds like anthranilic aicd, various polyamines such as EDTA, and the like.<br>
Advantageously, the compositions comprising mepiquat borate, partial borate, and mixed borate salts (collectively referred to hereinafter as "mepiquat borates") are substantially free of chlorine or other halide ions, as indicated by a chloride or other halogen content of from 0 to 1 wt.%, espeC1ally 0 to 0.5 wt.% compared with the compounds of formula (I) . For example borates obtained by the carbonate path contain about 1 ppm or less halogen.<br>
In general when recrystallised and purified in water the borates are substantially free of chloride.<br><br>
It is also preferred for the mepiquat borates of the invention to have a pH in aqueous solution that is approximately neutral, i.e., between about 5 and about 9.<br>
The mepiquat borate plant growth regulator formulations of the invention are applied to above ground portions of plants, i.e., by foliar application to control plant growth. Plants that can be treated by the compositions or formulations of the invention include any of the plants disclosed in the aforementioned US 3,905,798 to Zeeh et al., and other plants that are conven¬tionally treated with known mepiquat compositions, including wheat, barley and other small grains, grapes, poinsettias and other ornamentals and particularly cotton. Such foliar application can be carried out by various conventional methods and apparatus as are well known in the art including spraying, atomizing, dusting, boom and hand application, hydraulic nozzle, electrostatic atomizers, spreaders, and the like. If desired the product may be applied to using aircraft or helicopters equipped with hydraulic or granular application systems. Desirably, the formulations of the invention are applied in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
The compositions or formulations of the invention can be applied to cotton and other plants in a single application, but are preferably applied in multiple applications distributed through¬out the growing season, wherein the timing of application and the concentration of the active ingredients are varied depending on factors including the speC1es and variety of the plant; the development stage of the plant and the season of the year; the<br>
 application locality and site; climatic conditions, such as temperature, amount of preC1pitation, and also length of day and intensity of light; and soil properties, including fertilization. It is currently believed that the compositions or formulations of the invention are best applied in the case of cotton plants at an<br>
 application rate, calculated based on mepiquat cation, at a rate of from about 1 g/ha to about 100 g/ha, for each application. It is also currently believed that the compositions or formulations of the invention are best applied in the case of cotton plants in accordance with the same considerations as are used in connection<br>
 with PIX® plant growth regulator compositions, as discussed in for example, PIX® Plant Regulator,   OffiC1al Handbook,   1996, BASF Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 As with conventional mepiquat, the mepiquat borates of the inven¬tion function to inhibit the vegetative growth of plants, which is expressed in particular in a reduction in longitudinal growth.<br><br>
Hence the treated plants exhibit a dwarfed growth; and in most zases, a darker leaf coloration can also be observed. Among other affects, this also makes possible completely mechanized harvest¬ing of this important crop plant. Because of the small relatively Leaf and plant mass after treatment, attack by various diseases (such as fungus) can be decreased as well. The inhibition of vegetative growth also makes it possible to space the individual slants more closely, making a higher yield for the acreage possible.<br>
^.t least in some cases, it is believed that the borate anions or loieties, complexed or assoC1ated with the mepiquat cation, are :apable of potentiating or otherwise enhanC1ng the plant growth regulating properties of mepiquat. The terms "potentiate" and 'potentiated", are used herein, to include both quantitative .mprovements, and qualitative improvements such as one or more lifferent plant growth affects or properties, that are not mhanced as compared to conventional mepiquat chloride, applied ilone, particularly on cotton plants. Thus, in some instances, :he compositions of the invention are believed capable of sroviding increased yields of cotton lint, more vigorous, yet zontrolled, cotton plant development, and/or shortening of the :ime required for opening of the cotton boll by one day to several days or longer, depending on the particular growing season, location and weather conditions, and appropriate lanagement of the cotton crop.<br>
'he mepiquat borate compositions or formulations of the invention :an be supplied for agricultural use in various forms, including jackage, i.e., concentrated, and tank mix, i.e., ready to use, iorms, and also in various concentrations and different physical :orms. The mepiquat borate compositions or formulations of the .nvention can be directly supplied in dry granule, tablet, &gt;r powder form because of the non-hygroscopic nature of the .'ompositions. However, they can also be supplied as a liquid :oncentrate or full strength liquid.<br>
advantageously, in the form supplied for full strength or for liluted agricultural use, the compositions of the invention are .ncluded as an active ingredient in an amount ranging from about }.01 to about 40 wt.%, calculated based on the weight of mepiquat :ation.<br>
lepiquat borate concentrates made by the different processes for jreparation, may be used directly as ready mixes for agricultural ises.<br><br>
Furthermore the mepiquat borate concentrates can be dried under vacuum by the removal of water or spraydried to give water soluble powders or granules.<br>
If desired, the compositions or formulations can also be provided in the form of a liquid slurry or suspension in which all or a portion of the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in the liquid.<br>
Slurries or suspension concentrates are often preferred because they contain higher amounts of active ingredient and reduce the volume of packaging.<br>
Preferably the composition is supplied to the consumer for agri¬cultural use in the form of a concentrate in a sealed package. Such packages include glass and plastic bottles and bottle-like containers, carton containers, pouch containers formed of various film, foil, and/or paper materials or laminates thereof, and like containers as will be apparent. In such cases, the concentrate formulation is diluted by the user according to label instruc¬tions prior to use thereof, so that the active ingredients are applied at speC1fied rates, discussed in detail below. Typically, a concentrate formulation is diluted in an amount ranging from about 2:1 to about 800:1 (diluent to concentrate).<br>
In typical concentrate formulations, and in the form for application to plants, the formulation will also include one or more agriculturally acceptable diluents as are known in the art, including, in the case of liquid formulations, water, dimethyl sulfoxide, n-methylpyrrolidone, ketones, like cyclohexanone, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon oils, vegetable oils and modified vegetable oils such as esterified vegetable oils, alcohols such as isopropyl and ethyl alcohol, polyols such as ethylene or propylene glycols, esters, and the like.<br>
However some of these mentioned alcohols and polyoles can react in the solution with the borate anions as chelating agents.<br>
In addition, the liquid formulation can also include thickening agents, e.g. xanthane like Kelzan S (Kelco/Monsanto Performance Materials Company), natural based agents like guar gum, locust bean gum or alginate like sodium alginate, suspension concen¬trates of minerals like bentonites or hectorites, technical polymers like polymers or co-polymers of acrylic aC1d, sodium acrylate or acrylamide monomere or sugar derivatives like carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC) or methyl-cellulose and/or further derivatives, technical salts or blends of these compounds. They<br><br>
are used in the range of from 0 to 10 wt%. EspeC1ally xanthanes are used, preferably in the range of from 0 to 1 wt.%.<br>
In the case of solid formulations, various clays, binders, and fillers, such as diatomaceous earth, attapulgite, and the like, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea, solid polyols such as sorbitol, manitol and other sugars, and other solid carriers such as salt, dirt, wood-based or other cellulosic particulate materials, and the like. Various other preferred agriculturally acceptable carriers are disclosed in the aforementioned US 4,447,255 issued May 8, 1984 to Schott et al. and US 3,905,798, issued September 16, 1975 to Zeeh et al.<br>
In addition, the formulations of the present invention can also include other active ingredients like herbiC1des, fungiC1des, insectiC1des or other PGRs or adjuvants commonly employed in the art, including penetrants, surfactants, crop oils, drift control agents, defoaming agents, preservatives, wetting agents, adherents, antimicrobial agents, and the like, including mixtures thereof, as are also well known in the art and disclosed, for example in the aforementioned US 4,447,255 and US 3,905,798.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide solutions via bipolar electrodialysis<br>
The electrochemical process of this Example was carried out by the general method described by H. Stratmann et al., Chemtech (6) (1993) 17-24.<br>
A bipolar electrodialysis cell is constructed by alternating from five bipolar membranes, (commerC1ally available as "Neosepta BP1" from Tokuyama Corp., Japan), with five anion exchange membranes, (commerC1ally available as "AMH" membranes, from Tokuyama Corp., Japan), each having dimensions of 13 cm by 6 cm. The total active<br><br>
membrane area is about 3.78 dm2. The membrane spaC1ng is 0.5 mm. The base compartments are charged with 1000 g of a 10 wt.% strength aqueous solution of N,N-dimethylpiperidinium chloride. The aC1d compartments are charged with 1000 g of 0.5 wt.% 5 strength hydrochloric aC1d. After the electrodialysis current (3.78A) has been turned on, the two liquids are reC1rculated at a flow rate of about 20 1/h at 40°C.<br>
After an electrodialysis time of 240 min the initial chloride 0 concentration in the base compartments (2.37 wt.%) has been re¬duced to less than 0.1 wt.%, which means that the Cl'depletion achieved is 99.5%. The result is 923 g of a 9.1 wt.% strength N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide solution as the output from the base compartments and 994 g of about 3 wt.% strength hydro-3 chloric aC1d as the output from the aC1d compartments.<br>
Example 2<br>
Electrochemical preparation of N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide ) with oxidation of chloride to elemental chlorine as the anode reaction<br>
The electrochemical process of this Example was carried out by the general method described in GB-A 1066930 (Monsanto). i A conventional plate/frame electrolytic cell is converted into a bipartite cell by a cation exchange membrane (commerC1ally available as Nafion® 430 from Du Pont) which is fitted between the anode and the cathode. The active anode area and cathode area are a dm2 each. The anode is a DSA, and the cathode is an alloy steel (RA4) electrode.<br>
The catholyte is present in the form of 1000 g of an aqueous 0.5 wt.% strength N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide solution. The anolyte consists of 1000 g of an aqueous 3 0 wt.% strength N,N-dimethylpiperidinium chloride solution. At 4 0°C and 10A, the transfer of N,N-dimethylpiperidinium cations from the anolyte C1rcuit into the catholyte C1rcuit takes place at cell voltages of 6-10 V. At the same time chlorine is generated at the anode.<br>
After 8 h the catholyte output obtained consists of 1370.7 g of an aqueous 15.6 wt.% strength N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide solution. The solution has a residual chlorine content of 140 ppm. Based on the conversion ratio observed of 71.3%, the overall current yield is 54.7%.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of N,N-dimethylpiperidinium [B506 (OH) 4] -solution by bipolar electrodialysis - Compound 1.0<br>
The bipolar electrodialysis cell consists of an alternating arrangement of five bipolar membranes (e.g. (Aqualytics, poly-sulfone type) and five anion exchange membranes (e.g. AM-3, Tokuyama Corp.) having a total membrane area of 10 dm2 and a membrane spaC1ng of 0.5 mm. Integrated in the base loop is a receiving vessel with a stirring unit into which 13.3 kg of boric aC1d is precharged before the start of the electrolysis. A solution of 50.0 kg of a 12 wt.% solution of mepiquat chloride is put into the base C1rcuit. In the aC1d loop a 0.5 wt.% solution of sodium chloride is made ready which during the electrodialysis is kept within a pH range of between 6 and 8 by metering in 29.0 kg of a 10 wt.% solution of sodium hydroxide. C1rculating in the electrode C1rcuit is a 5 wt.% solution of sodium sulfate. The anode and cathode are made of platinum. After 48 h at 40°C, a flow rate of 100 1/h and an initial current density of 5.7 A/dm2 the chloride ion concentration has decreased from 2.86 wt.% to 0.12 wt.%, corresponding to a degree of desalination of 96.2%. The boric aC1d in the receiving vessel is completely dissolved in the course of the electrolysis. The base loop contains 59.2 kg of a 22.7 wt.% solution of The yield with reference<br>
to DMP amounts to 99.5% and the current effiC1ency is 93.2%.<br>

Comparison of (A) mepiquat chloride, with (B) a mixture of mepiquat chloride with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Solubor®), and (C) mepiquat pentaborate (compound 1.9) of example 13.<br>
The tests of this example were conducted according to the method of DIN (Deutsche Industrie Norm) No. 52168, part 1 of Nov. 19 81, but using modified steel plates.<br>
The corrosion tests were conducted on the three different formulations prepared as set forth below. Each formulation was tested with the different steel types set forth below.<br>
The first formulation, referred to as "mepiquat chloride" in the tables below, was an 8.33% mepiquat chloride aqueous solution (by weight) prepared by diluting a 600 g/1 mepiquat chloride preconcentrate. The second formulation, referred to as "mepiquat chloride plus borate salt" in the tables below, was prepared by adding 15 wt.% disodium octaborate tetrahydrate to the same 8.33% aqueous solution of mepiquat chloride as was used in the first formulation.<br>
The third formulation, referred to as "mepiquat pentaborate" - in the tables below, was prepared from compound 1.9, example 13 by diluting with water to form a 12% mepiquat pentaborate (wt.%) aqueous solution.<br>
All three abovementioned formulations contained equal amounts of the mepiquat cation.<br>
One-half liter quantities of each formulation were placed in polyethylene plastic containers (10 cm x 10 cm x 12 cm (height)). Into each of the containers, two series of steel plate types -12x5 cm2 (0.2 cm thickness) were inserted. In modification of the mentioned DIN, the steel plates were pre¬pared with an additional oxyacetylene torched area, approximately 5 to 7 mm large, horizontally in the middle of the steel plates.<br>
 The torched areas were placed below the solution's surface.<br><br>
(The aim of this modification of the test was to simulate a more serious corrosion and endangering situation.)<br>
The position of the plates were such that approximately 1/3 of the plates were in air contact. After 14 days the steel plates were examined, washed and cleaned, dried and weighed according to the DIN method above.<br>
Results: From the corrosion results set forth below, (particu¬larly based on loss of material in g/m2) it can be seen that the "mepiquat pentaborate" is a non-corrosive material (test series 1 and 2).<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The following three reC1pes describe novel suspension concen¬trates with boric aC1d, borax and mepiquat pentaborate as start¬ing materials. The formulations include here a ratio of &gt;1:30 of mepiquat and boron. In all formulations the amount of the mepiquat cation is 32 g/1.<br>
Example 15a<br>
To 232.9 g of a 15.8 wt.% aqueous solution of mepiquat hydroxide (0.28 mol) a mixture of 182 g of boric aC1d (2.94 mol) and 561.4 g of borax (Na2B407 x 10 H20, 1.47 mol) was added with stirring with a lab dispenser. After 10 min 16.6 g of a pre-concentrate of Kelsan S* (2% in water) and 288.8 g of destilled water were added.<br>
The mixture was stirred for about 1 hour. The resulting suspension concentrate was stable, colorless, homogenous and could be used as ready mix in tankmix applications under full dissolution of all components.<br>
The ratio of 1: 32 of mepiquat to boron was confirmed by ion chromatography and elementary analysis.<br>
