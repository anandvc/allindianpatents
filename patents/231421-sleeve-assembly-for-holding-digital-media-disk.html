CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of prior Application. No. 10/800,811,<br>
filed March 15,2004, priority from the filing date of which is hereby claimed under<br>
35 U.S.C. § 120.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to packaging systems and, in particular, to<br>
packaging for flat products such as compact disks and digital video disks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Digital information/entertainment products are increasingly being distributed on<br>
flat storage media, such as compact disks ("CDs"), digital video disks ("DVDs"), and the<br>
like. For example, music, music videos, movies, software, photographs, promotional<br>
materials such as catalogues and directories are commonly produced and distributed on<br>
CDs and/or DVDs. CDs, DVDs, and similar flat storage media are collectively referred<br>
to herein as "digital media disks." Digital media disks have many advantages over other<br>
prior art storage media. They are relatively easy and inexpensive to produce, flexible to<br>
modify and format, and provide a convenient form factor. Although the most common<br>
digital media disks are circular with a diameter of about 12 cm, digital media disks<br>
having different sizes and/or shapes are also available. Digital media disks are generally<br>
amenable to external markings—for example, to identify the digital content stored on the<br>
media and/or to provide other aesthetic, promotional, and/or informational content.<br>
Players for the various types of digital media disks are becoming ubiquitous.<br>
The packaging of music CDs, for example, frequently includes a hard, transparent<br>
or semitransparent, plastic case, often called a "jewel case." An insert or placard is<br>
frequently insertable into the jewel case, providing identifying indicia indicating the<br>
content of the CD. The insert may include other information, such as a play list, lyrics,<br>
copyright notice, content warnings or ratings, and credits such as the various artists and<br>
producers involved in producing the CD.<br>
The conventional jewel case, however, has some disadvantages. The jewel case is<br>
relatively thick and heavy, with many hard corners. This may make the jewel case (and<br>
enclosed CD) inconvenient to carry around, such as in a pocket or backpack. The jewel<br>
case is also typically formed of a brittle, hard plastic that is susceptible to scratching and<br><br>
breakage. For example, the jewel case may break when dropped or otherwise mishandled<br>
and, in particular, the integral hinge mechanism is susceptible to damage. The jewel case<br>
also can be difficult to open. The jewel case also typically includes an engagement<br>
member that extends through the center hole in the CD and clasps the CD to secure it to<br>
the case and prevent it from accidentally falling out while the jewel case is being opened.<br>
Such engagement members, however, may farther complicate removal of the CD and, in<br>
particular, may result in damage to the CD—for example, if the user attempts to remove<br>
the CD by pulling upwardly on an outer edge without first disengaging the mechanism.<br>
Such jewel cases are also relatively expensive to produce.<br>
Other cases for CDs have been proposed that overcome some of the jewel case<br>
disadvantages discussed above, utilizing paperboard material to form the carrier. For<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,655,656 discloses a two-piece sleeve package for compact<br>
disks made from paperboard card stock, having an outer container and a separable inner<br>
sleeve that slidably engages the outer container. U.S. Patent No. 6,241,085 discloses a<br>
folded paperboard CD carrier for holding a plurality of CDs in a side-by-side<br>
arrangement U.S. Patent No. 6,637,588 discloses a folded paperboard CD carrier having<br>
a folded panel including a protrusion that is adapted to be inserted through the center<br>
aperture of the CD. However, these carriers are relatively complex. Moreover, because<br>
paperboard is opaque, the user cannot readily identify the content of the enclosed CD<br>
without opening the carrier.<br>
There remains a need, therefore, for a carrier for digital media disks such as CDs<br>
and DVDs that is relatively simple and easy to produce, and easy to open for removing a<br>
digital media disk.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A sleeve assembly for a digital media disk such as a compact disk, digital video<br>
disk, or the like, is disclosed. The sleeve assembly allows the use of a generic sleeve<br>
member that does not have product-specific indicia, in combination with a placard that is<br>
removably retained therewith, the placard having product-specific indicia. At least a<br>
portion of the identifying indicia is visible through one or more apertures in the sleeve<br>
assembly, even when the sleeve assembly is in a closed configuration. The sleeve<br>
assembly includes a multipanel sleeve member, such as a three-panel, trifold type sleeve,<br>
wherein a first and second panel each includes a retaining member for retaining the<br>
placard having identifying indicia printed thereon. One or both of the first and second<br><br>
panels have apertures that are positioned to expose at least a portion of the identifying<br>
indicia on the placard. A third panel includes a pocket that opens inwardly or other<br>
retaining device that is adapted to receive a digital media disk such that the disk is<br>
securely retained in the sleeve when the sleeve assembly is folded to a closed position.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, an aperture is provided, disposed generally<br>
between the first and second panels, whereby when the sleeve assembly is closed, the<br>
aperture extends across the spine of the fold to expose a portion of the placard that is<br>
viewable from the end of the sleeve assembly. This may allow the user to identify a<br>
particular disk from a stack of similar disks.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the sleeve assembly includes a multipanel<br>
sleeve having a first sleeve panel with a first retaining member, a second sleeve panel<br>
with a second retaining member, the first sleeve panel hingedly connected to the second<br>
sleeve panel along a sleeve spine. Means for releasably attaching a digital media disk to<br>
the multipanel sleeve are included. A placard is provided having identifying indicia<br>
printed thereon. The placard is sized to engage the first and second retaining members<br>
such that the placard is removably retained on the sleeve and at least a portion of the<br>
identifying indicia is viewable through a viewing aperture through the multipanel sleeve<br>
when the sleeve is closed.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the sleeve assembly includes a hinged portion<br>
that retains the placard on an outer surface and a separable box portion that receives the<br>
hinged portion, and includes apertures through which at least a portion of the identifying<br>
indicia is viewable.<br>
The present invention includes a method for packaging a digital media disk<br>
including the steps of providing a multipanel sleeve including means for retaining a<br>
digital media disk, the sleeve having at least one viewing aperture therethrough, retaining<br>
the disk in the sleeve, printing a placard having identifying indicia associated with the<br>
digital media disk, and retaining the placard on the sleeve such that the identifying indicia<br>
is visible through the viewing aperture.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A currently preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described<br>
with reference to the figures, wherein like numbers indicate like parts. FIGURE 1 is a<br>
perspective view of an assembled digital media disk sleeve assembly 100 shown in a<br>
closed, or folded, configuration. The sleeve assembly 100 includes a sleeve member 110<br>
that is preferably die-cut from a sheet of paperboard, as discussed in detail below. The<br>
sleeve member 110 includes a front aperture 112 and a spine aperture 114. A removable<br>
placard 160 (partially visible in FIGURE 1) is disposed generally inside the folded sleeve<br><br>
member 110 and includes a portion that is visible through the front aperture 112 and the<br>
spine aperture 114 of the sleeve member 110. The placard 160 may include first<br>
identifying indicia 162 printed or otherwise disposed on the placard to be visible through<br>
the front aperture 112, and second identifying indicia 164 printed or otherwise disposed<br>
on the placard 160 to be visible through the spine aperture 114.<br>
FIGURE 2A shows the sleeve assembly 100 partially opened and FIGURE 2B<br>
shows the sleeve assembly 100 substantially fully opened, with the placard 160 shown in<br>
phantom to expose details of the sleeve member 110 and arrows included to show the<br>
unfolding sequence. The sleeve assembly 100 is shown having a three-panel or "trifold11<br>
configuration. It is contemplated, however, that the present invention may be readily<br>
practiced using a four-panel or more than four-panel sleeve assembly in a straightforward<br>
manner without departing from the present invention and may be readily adapted to hold<br>
more than one digital media disk.<br>
As seen most clearly in FIGURE 2B, the sleeve member 110 includes a first end<br>
panel 116, a middle panel 126, and a second end panel 136. The first end panel 116 is<br>
hingedly connected to the middle panel 126 through hinge portion 118, which is<br>
preferably formed by two closely-spaced, parallel folds 119, 120. A first retaining<br>
member 121 overlies and generally conforms to the distal portion of the first end<br>
panel 116. The first retaining member 121 is connected to the first end panel 116 at the<br>
top edge 121A and bottom edge 121B, and is free or open on the sides 121C such that a<br>
flat channel or opening is formed between the first retaining member 121 and the first end<br>
panel 116.<br>
The middle panel 126 is also hingedly connected to the second end panel 136<br>
through hinge portion 128, which is preferably formed by a single transverse fold. The<br>
middle panel 126 includes a second retaining member 131 opposite the first retaining<br>
member 121 and disposed generally adjacent to the second end panel. The second<br>
retaining member 131 is connected to the middle panel 126 at the top edge 131A and<br>
bottom edge 13 IB, and free on the sides 131C, such that a flat channel or opening is<br>
formed between the second retaining member 131 and the middle panel 126.<br>
The second end panel 136 includes a pocket member 141 disposed at the distal<br>
end of the second end panel 136. The pocket member 141 is connected to the second end<br>
panel 136 at a top edge 141 A, bottom edge 141B, and distal side edge 141C, and open at<br>
the proximal side edge 141D, to form a pocket. The pocket is sized to slidably receive a<br><br>
digital media disk 90. The proximal edge 141D of the pocket member 141 may include a<br>
semicircular cutout 144 mat is positioned to expose the central aperture 92 of the digital<br>
media disk 90 to permit a user to remove the disk 90 by inserting a finger into the<br>
aperture 92 to slide the disk 90 outwardly, away from the pocket<br>
The hinge portion 118 between the first end panel 116 and the middle panel 126 is<br>
wider than the hinge portion 128 between the middle panel 126 and the second end<br>
portion 136, such that when the sleeve assembly 100 is folded or closed, as shown in<br>
FIGURE 1, the hinge portion 118 will accommodate the thickness of the second end<br>
panel 136, including the digital media disk 90.<br>
It will be appreciated from FIGURE 3 that the placard 160 is sized to overlie the<br>
combineJ first end panel 116 and middle panel 126 such that the opposite end<br>
portions 160A, 160B of the placard 160 may be slidably inserted in the respective flat<br>
channels formed by the first and second retaining members 121, 131. In particular, the<br>
placard 160 is a flexible, simple paperboard panel wherein the left end 160A may be<br>
inserted underneath the first retaining member 121 and the right end 160B may be<br>
inserted underneath the second retaining member 131. The placard 160 may then be<br>
slidably adjusted to generally overlie the first end panel 116 and the middle panel 118 of<br>
the sleeve member 110. The digital media disk 90 is inserted into the pocket formed by<br>
the pocket member 141. The placard 160 includes a center hinge portion 169 that<br>
overlies the sleeve member hinge portion 118.<br>
FIGURE 4A shows a front view of the open, assembled sleeve assembly 100 and<br>
FIGURE 4B shows a rear view of the sleeve assembly 100. It is contemplated that the<br>
front of the placard 160 may include a third identifying indicia 166 suitable for the<br>
particular digital media disk—for example, a play list, user instructions, included<br>
features, copyright notice, or other product information. It is also contemplated that a<br>
fourth identifying indicia 168 may be printed one or both of the end portions 160A, 160B<br>
of the placard 160 that are obscured by the first and second retaining members 121, 131.<br>
For example, it may be aesthetically desirable to put rarely accessed information or<br>
semiprivate information on the end portions 160A, 16OB of the placard 160.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 4B, the back side of the placard 160 includes first and<br>
second identifying indicia 162, 164 that are positioned to be visible through the front<br>
aperture 112 and spine aperture 114, respectively, when the placard 160 is hi the desired<br>
position. It will now be appreciated that, in the preferred embodiment, the sleeve<br><br>
member 110 does not include any printed information or other indicia that is particular to<br>
the specific digital media disk 90 and, therefore, the sleeve member may be generically<br>
used with different disks. For example, identical sleeve members 110 may be used with a<br>
whole collection of different music CDs, which may result in significant manufacturing<br>
and cost reductions. It is contemplated, however, that the sleeve member 110 might<br>
include generic information, such as by printing, embossing, or otherwise, such as a<br>
house trademark, manufacturer or distributor identification, commercial information, or<br>
aesthetic markings. The placard 160 contains identifying indicia that may be specific to<br>
the digital media disk 90 with which it is associated. The placard 160 is preferably a<br>
simple rectangular, flat piece of paperboard that is easily printed on. Moreover, the first<br>
and second identifying indicia 162, 164 may be printed on only the relatively small<br>
portion of the back side of the placard 160 that is visible through the apertures 112, 114<br>
of the sleeve member 110.<br>
In particular, it will be appreciated from FIGURE 5 that the second identifying<br>
indicia 164, visible through the spine aperture 114, permits a user to identify and select a<br>
particular digital media disk (not shown) even when a plurality of sleeve assemblies 100<br>
is stacked or otherwise having only the edge characterized by the hinge portion 118<br>
visible.<br>
A die-cut form 111 for the sleeve member 110 is shown in FIGURE 6. The<br>
form 110 is a single, flat paperboard form, including the first end panel 116, middle<br>
panel 126, and second end panel 136, first and second retaining members 121,131, and<br>
pocket member 141. Front aperture 112, and spine aperture 114 are precut. It will be<br>
appreciated that although the front aperture 112 and the spine aperture 114 are shown as<br>
circular, other shapes are possible and contemplated by the present invention, including<br>
square, oval, and the like. It is also contemplated that there may be more than two<br>
apertures that permit additional or other portions of the placard 160 to be visible through<br>
the sleeve member 110, including, for example, a large number of relatively small<br>
apertures arranged in an aesthetically pleasing pattern.<br>
Tab members 150, 152, 154, and 156 are positioned to be folded along<br>
corresponding fold lines 151, 153, 155, and 157, respectively. It will be apparent from<br>
FIGURE 6 that, to assemble the sleeve member, the tab members 150,152, 154, and 156<br>
are folded inwardly and an adhesive is applied thereto. The retaining members 121, 131<br><br>
and the pocket member 141 may then be folded downwardly to engage the appropriate<br>
tab members to form the sleeve member 110.<br>
A second embodiment of a sleeve assembly 200 according to the present<br>
invention, is shown in FIGURE 7, including a sleeve member 210 and a placard 260. In<br>
this embodiment, the multipanel (tripanel) sleeve member 210 includes a first end<br>
panel 216 hingedly connected to a middle panel 226 along spine 219 and an oppositely<br>
disposed second end panel 236 also hingedly connected to the middle panel 226. The<br>
first end panel 216 and middle panel 226 may be substantially similar to the first end<br>
panel 116 and middle panel 126, respectively, of the first embodiment described above.<br>
For example, the first end panel 216 and the middle panel 226 include first and second<br>
retaining members 221, 231 that slidably receive and retain the separable placard 260.<br>
One or both of the first end panel 216 and middle panel 226 include one or more<br>
apertures 212 (two shown in phantom) such that portions of the placard 260 are viewable<br>
through the apertures 212. A spine aperture 214 (shown in phantom) may also be<br>
provided such that portions of the placard 260 are visible therethrough.<br>
The second end panel 236 of the present invention includes a rigid or semirigid<br>
disk holder 241 that may be made from a polymeric material—for example, a<br>
thermoplastic such as a polyethylene or polypropylene. The disk holder 241 defines a<br>
circular or substantially annular recess 243 that is sized to accommodate the digital media<br>
disk 90 (shown in phantom). A center, elastically flexible retaining member 244 that is<br>
sized to engage a center aperture 92 of the digital media disk 90 extends from the circular<br>
recess 243. The disk holder may include one or more peripheral indentations 245 (four<br>
shown) to facilitate removal of the digital media disk 90 from the disk holder 241. Such<br>
disk holders 241 are known in the art. The disk holder 241 is preferably permanently<br>
affixed to the second end panel 236—for example, with an adhesive or a secure double-<br>
sticky tape (not shown)—such that the disk holder 241 will not separate from the second<br>
end panel 236, even over repeated usage.<br>
As seen most clearly in FIGURES 8A and 8B, the front side of the placard 260<br>
(shown in FIGURE 8A) preferably includes one or more first identifying indicia 262 (two<br>
shown) printed or otherwise disposed on the placard 260 to be visible through the front<br>
apertures 212 of the sleeve member 210, and second identifying indicia 264 printed or<br>
otherwise disposed on the spine 269 of the placard 260 to be visible through the spine<br>
aperture 214 of the sleeve member 210. The back side of the placard 260 (shown in<br><br><br>
FIGURE 8B) may include additional identifying indicia 266—for example, specific<br>
information suitable for the particular digital media disk, such as a play list, user<br>
instructions, included features, copyright notice, or other product information—as<br>
discussed above. The placard 260 spine portion 269 is positioned to overlie the spine<br>
portion 219 of the sleeve member 210.<br>
A die-cut paperboard form 211 for a preferred embodiment of the sleeve<br>
member 210 is shown in FIGURE 9. The form 211 is a single, flat paperboard form,<br>
including the first end panel 216, middle panel 226, and second end panel 236 and first<br>
and second retaining members 221, 231. Front apertures 212 and spine aperture 214 are<br>
precut.<br>
Tab members 250 and 252 are positioned to be folded as shown. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the second end panel 236 includes reinforcing portion 237 that is folded to<br>
overlie and is bonded to the second end panel 236 to provide additional strength for<br>
supporting the disk holder 241. The disk holder 241 is shown with an arrow indicating<br>
placement on the second end panel 236 after folding over the reinforcing portion 237.<br>
The sleeve member 210 is formed by cutting the form 211, including the apertures 212,<br>
214 as shown, and scoring along fold lines as desired, folding the tab portions 250, 252,<br>
retaining members 221, 231, reinforcing portion 237, and bonding to form the sleeve<br>
member 210. The disk holder 241 is then affixed to the second end panel 236.<br>
A third embodiment of a sleeve assembly 300 according to the present invention<br>
is shown in FIGURE 10A (partially exploded view) and FIGURE 10B (closed view). In<br>
this embodiment, a sleeve member includes a hinged portion 370 and a separable box<br>
portion 380. The hinged portion 370 is also shown in FIGURES 11A and 11B (with the<br>
placard 260) and includes a first panel 316 that is hingedly connected to a second<br>
panel 336, both preferably formed unitarily from a paperboard form. The second<br>
panel 336 has the disk holder 241 fixedly attached thereto for releasably retaining a<br>
digital media disk as discussed above. The disk holder 241 may be attached to the second<br>
panel 336—for example, by affixing double sided tape.<br>
In contrast to the previously described embodiments, first and second retaining<br>
members 321, 331 are provided on a back side of the sleeve hinged portion 370, the first<br>
and second retaining members 321, 331 adapted to slidably engage the placard 260,<br>
which is described in detail above. As seen most clearly in FIGURJE 10A, the<br>
placard 260 generally wraps around the sleeve hinged portion 370, overlapping an outer<br><br>
surface of the folded hinged portion 370, and slides underneath the first and second<br>
retaining members 321, 331.<br>
As shown in the figures, the hinged portion 370 and box portion 380 are sized<br>
such that the hinged portion 370, with the attached placard 260, is insertable into the<br>
boxed portion 380, providing a relatively snug fit. The boxed portion 380 includes one or<br>
more viewing apertures 312 that are positioned such that at least a portion of the first<br>
identifying indicia 262 is visible through the viewing apertures 312 when the hinged<br>
portion 370 is fully inserted into the box portion 380. Moreover, it will be appreciated<br>
from FIGURE 10B that the second identifying indicia 264 is visible through the open end<br>
of the box portion 380 when the hinged portion 370 is appropriately inserted into the box<br>
portion 380. In thepreiferred embodiment, the sleeve box portion 380 is also made from a<br>
die-cut paperboard form folded and bonded to form the box portion 380, although it is<br>
contemplated that the box portion 380 may alternatively be made from other suitable<br>
materials.<br>
It is contemplated that me sleeve assembly of the present invention will be<br>
particularly suitable in applications wherein a user-customizable selection of data is<br>
provided on digital media disks to a user. For example, a user may desire to purchase a<br>
customized play list of music tracks that are recorded onto a single compact disk. With<br>
the present invention, a generic or quasi-generic sleeve member, such as 110, 210, or 370<br>
and 380 as described above, may be provided. The sleeve member may not include any<br>
information specific to the particular compact disk defined by the user, and therefore<br>
single, generic (or a small collection of generic) sleeve members may be used for many<br>
different users. Of course, the sleeve member may include indicia not related to the user's<br>
customized selection, such as a house trademark, commercial information, artwork, and<br>
the like.<br>
A placard, for example, 160, 260 containing information specific to the compact<br>
disk—for example, the play list, track play times, artist, album, etc.—may then be easily<br>
printed, and provided for insertion onto the sleeve member. The placard may have other<br>
indicia printed thereon, including picture, artwork, and the like, at least some of which<br>
indicia may be user selectable.<br>
The user may then insert the placard into the sleeve member and attach and/or<br>
enclose the compact disk in the sleeve member. The present invention, therefore,<br><br>
provides a convenient packaging system containing specific indicia regarding the disk,<br>
without requiring any special printing or marking of the sleeve member.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
