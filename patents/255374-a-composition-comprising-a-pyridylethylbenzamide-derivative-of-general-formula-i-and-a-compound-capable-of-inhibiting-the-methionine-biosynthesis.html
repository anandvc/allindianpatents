				<td>The present invention relates to novel fungicide compositions comprising a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative and a compound capable of inhibiting the methionine biosynthesis. The present invention also relates to a method of combating or controlling phytopathogenic fungi by applying at a locus infested or liable to be infested such a composition.<br>
International patent application WO 01/11965 generically discloses numerous pyridylethylbenzamide derivatives. The possibility of combining one or more of these numerous pyridylethylbenzamide derivatives with known fungicidal products to develop a fungicidal activity is disclosed in general terms, without any specific example or biological data.<br>
It is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal mixtures showing a synergistic effect in order notably to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients or to the mixtures of known active ingredients used by the farmer while minimising the doses of chemical products spread in the environment and reducing the cost of the treatment.<br>
We have now found some novel fungicidal compositions which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition comprising : a) a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which:<br>
-	p is an integer equal to 1,2, 3 or 4;<br>
-	q is an integer equal to 1,2, 3,4 or 5;<br>
-	each substituent X is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen, alkyl or haloalkyl;<br>
- each substituent Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen, alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, phenoxy, alkylthio, dialkylamino, acyl,<br>
cyano, ester, hydroxy, aminoalkyl, benzyl, haloalkoxy, halosulphonyl, halothioalkyl,<br>
alkoxyalkenyl, alkylsulphonamide, nitro, alkyl sulphonyl, phenylsulphonyl or<br>
benzylsulphonyl;<br>
as to the N-oxides of 2-pyridine thereof;<br>
and<br>
b) a compound capable of inhibiting the methionine biosynthesis;<br>
in a (a) / (b) weight ratio of from 0.01 to 20.<br>
In the context of the present invention :<br>
- halogen means chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine;<br>
- each of the alkyl or acyl radicals present in the molecule contains from 1 to<br>
1 0 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to<br>
5 carbon atoms, and may be linear or branched;<br>
- each of the alkenyl or alkynyl radicals present in the molecule contains from 2 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 5<br>
carbon atoms, and may be linear or branched.<br>
The composition according to the present invention provides a synergistic<br>
effect. This synergistic effect allows a reduction of the chemical substances spread<br>
into the environment and a reduction of the cost of the fungal treatment.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" is defined<br>
by Colby according to the article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and<br>
antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations" Weeds, (1967), 15, pages 20-22.<br>
The latter article mentions the formula:<br>
100<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the disease for the<br>
combination of the two fungicides at defined doses (for example equal to x and y<br>
respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the<br>
compound (I) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition<br>
observed for the disease by the compound (II) at a defined dose (equal to y). When<br>
the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a<br>
synergistic effect.<br>
The composition according to the present invention comprises a<br>
pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I). Preferably, the present<br>
invention relates to a composition comprising a pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of<br>
general formula (I) in which the different characteristics may be chosen alone or in<br>
combination as being:<br>
- as regards p, p is 2;<br>
- as regards q, q is 1 or 2. More preferably, q is 2;<br>
- as regards X, X is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen or<br>
haloalkyl. More preferably, X is chosen, independently of the others, as being a<br>
chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group;<br>
- as regards Y, Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being halogen or<br>
haloalkyl. More preferably, Y is chosen, independently of the others, as being a<br>
chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group;<br>
More preferably, the pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I)<br>
present in the composition of the present invention is :<br>
-N-{2-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]ethyl}-2-trifiuoromethylbenzamide<br>
(compound 1);<br>
-N-{2-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]ethyl}-2-iodobenzamide<br>
(compound 2); or<br>
- N-{2-[3,5-dichloro-2-pyridinyl]ethyl}-2-trifluoromethylbenzamide (compound 3).<br>
Even more preferably, the pyridylethylbenzamide derivative of general<br>
formula (1) present in the composition of the present invention is N-{2-[3-chloro-5-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]ethyl }-2-trifluoromethylbenzamide (compound 1).<br>
The composition according to the present invention comprises a compound<br>
capable of inhibiting the methionine biosynthesis. Preferably, the present invention<br>
relates to a composition comprising a compound capable of inhibiting the methionine<br>
biosynthesis selected from cyprodinyl, mepanipyrim and pyrimethanil. Pyrimethanil<br>
is preferred.<br>

The composition according to the present invention may further comprise an<br>
other additional component such as an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or<br>
filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, „<br>
organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it<br>
easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert<br>
and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid.<br>
Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica,<br>
resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents,<br>
mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be<br>
used.<br>
The composition may also comprise other additional components. In<br>
particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be<br>
an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a<br>
mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid<br>
salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts,<br>
polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty<br>
amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of<br>
sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates),<br>
phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of<br>
polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and<br>
phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential<br>
when the active material and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the<br>
vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be<br>
comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids,<br>
adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering<br>
agents. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid<br>
additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05<br>
to 99% (by weight) of active material, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention can be used in various forms<br>
such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable<br>
powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil,<br>
encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas<br>
(under pressure), gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate,<br>
macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable<br>
concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment,<br>
seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed<br>
treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ulv)<br>
liquid, ultra low volume (ulv) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water<br>
dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water<br>
soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be<br>
applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a<br>
spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which<br>
must be diluted before they are applied to the crop.<br>
The fungicidal compositions of the present invention can be used to curatively<br>
or preventively control phytopathogenic fungi of crops. Thus, according to a further<br>
aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventively or<br>
curatively controlling phytopathogenic fungi of crops characterised in that a fungicidal<br>
composition as hereinbefore defined is applied to the seed, the plant and/or to the fruit<br>
of the plant or to the soil in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.<br>
The composition as used against phytopathogenic fungi of crops comprises an<br>
effective and non-phytotoxic amount of an active material of general formula (I).<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of<br>
composition according to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the<br>
fungi present or liable to appear on the crops, and which does not entail any appreciable<br>
symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide<br>
range depending on the fungus to be combated or controlled, the type of crop, the<br>
climatic conditions and the compounds included in the fungicidal composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the<br>
capabilities of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The method of treatment according to the present invention is useful to treat<br>
propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or<br>
seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment<br>
can also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the present<br>
invention can also be useful to treat the overground parts of the plant such as trunks,<br>
stems or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits of the concerned plant.<br>
Among the plants that can be protected by the method according to the<br>
invention, mention may be made of cotton; flax; vine; fruit crops such as Rosaceae<br>

used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term "timber"<br>
means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended<br>
for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and<br>
plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists<br>
in contacting one or more compounds of the present invention, or a composition<br>
according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying,<br>
dipping, injection or any other suitable means.<br>
The fungicidal composition according to the present invention may also be<br>
used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms with the compounds<br>
according to the invention or the agrochemical compositions according to the<br>
invention. Genetically modified plants are plants into in which genome a<br>
heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest has been stably integrated. The<br>
expression "heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest" essentially means<br>
genes which give the transformed plant new agronomic properties, or genes for<br>
improving the agronomic quality of the transformed plant.<br>
The dose of active material usually applied in the treatment according to the<br>
present invention is generally and advantageously between 10 and 2000 g/ha,<br>
preferably between 20 and 1500 g/ha for applications in foliar treatment. The dose of<br>
active substance applied is generally and advantageously between 1 and 200 g per<br>
100 kg of seed, preferably between 2 and 150 g per 100 kg of seed in the case of seed<br>
treatment. It is clearly understood that the doses indicated above are given as<br>
illustrative examples of the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to<br>
adapt the application doses according to the nature of the crop to be treated.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may also be used fore<br>
the preparation of composition useful to curatively or preventively treat human and<br>
animal fungal diseases such as, for example, mycoses, dermatoses, trichophyton<br>
diseases and candidiases or diseases caused by Aspergillus spp. or Candida spp., for<br>
example Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans respectively.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with the following examples :<br>
Example 1 ; Efficacy against Erysiphe sraminis f. sp. eraminis of a mixture<br>
containing N-l2-13-chloro-5-(trifluoromethYl)-2-pvridinYllethvl}-2-<br>
trifluoromethylbcnzamide (Compound 1) and cvnrodinil<br>
The active ingredients tested are prepared by potter homogenisation in a<br>
mixture of acetone/tween/water. This suspension is then diluted with water to obtain<br>
the desired active material concentration.<br>
Wheat plants (Audace variety) in starter cups, sown on 50/50 peat<br>
soil-pozzolana substrate and grown at 12°C, are treated at the 1-leaf stage (10 cm<br>
tall) by spraying with the aqueous suspension described above.<br>
Plants, used as controls, are treated with an aqueous solution not containing<br>
the active material.<br>
After 24 hours, the plants are contaminated by dusting them with Erysiphe<br>
graminis f. sp. tritici spores, the dusting being carried out using diseased plants.<br>
Grading is carried out 7 to 14 days after the contamination, in comparison<br>
with the control plants.<br>
The following table summarises the results obtained when tested compound 1<br>
and cyprodinil alone and in a 16:1 weight ratio mixture.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
According to the Colby method, a synergistic effect of the mixtures tested has<br>
been observed.<br>
Example 2 : Efficacy against Botrytis cinerea of a mixture containing N-(2-(3-<br>
chloro-5-ftrifluoroniethvl)-2-pvridinvllethvU-2-trifluoromethvlbenzamide<br>
(Compound 1) and pyrimethanil<br>
The formulated (concentrated suspension) compounds are diluted with water<br>
to obtain the desired active material concentration Gherkin plants (Petit vert de Paris<br>
variety) in starter cups, sown on a 50/50 peat soil-pozzolana substrate and grown at<br>
18- 20°C, are treated at the cotyledon Zll stage by spraying with the aqueous<br>
suspension described above. Plants, used as controls, are treated with an aqueous<br>
soluti9n not containing the active material.<br>
After 24 hours, the plants are contaminated by depositing drops of an aqueous<br>
suspension of Botrytis cinerea spores (150,000 spores per ml) on upper surface of the<br>
leaves. The spores are collected from a 15-day-old culture and are suspended in a<br>
nutrient solution composed of :<br>
- 20 g/L of gelatine<br>
- 50 g/L of cane sugar<br>
-2g/LofNH4N03<br>
- 1 g/L of KH2P04<br>
The contaminated gherkin plants are settled for 5/7 days in a climatic room at<br>
15-11°C (day/night) and at 80% relative humidity. Grading (% of efficacy) is carried<br>
out 5 to 7 days after the contamination, in comparison with the control plants.<br>
The following table summarises the results obtained when tested compound 1<br>
and pyrimethanil alone and in a 3:1 weight ratio mixture.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
According to the Colby method, a synergistic effect of the mixtures tested has<br>
