DOCUMENT Description<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Synthetic resin pallet<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic resin pallet which is used to transport and store various articles and which can be transported by a forklift, pallet truck, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
In general, a synthetic resin pallet which is formed by injecting a synthetic resin is used as a pallet for transportation and storage of various articles. Specifically, a synthetic resin pallet to which two forks of a forklift and the like are inserted in two directions, and a synthetic resin pallet to which two forks are inserted in four directions are used (Japanese Unexamined Patent Applications, First Publication Nos. 2001-72063 and 2000-16430). [0003]<br>
These synthetic resin pallets comprise an upper plate part and a lower plate part which are positioned in parallel each other, and columns connecting between the upper plate part and the lower plate part. The upper and lower plate parts are connected by the columns which are arranged on the both sides and the middle of the upper and lower plate parts. There is a pair of fork insertion apertures at the space between the upper and lower plate parts. Specifically, a side part surrounding a space between the upper and lower plate parts comprises the columns and the fork insertion apertures. [0004]<br>
The synthetic resin pallet is used to transport and store articles in a bulk. Specifically, a pair of forks of a forklift or a pallet truck is inserted into the fork insertion apertures of the synthetic resin pallet while articles are put on the upper side of the synthetic resin pallet, and the synthetic resin pallet together with the articles is transported to the bed of a truck or a storage area. Thereby, it is possible to transport and store the articles in a bulk.<br>
In order to prevent collapse of the articles on the synthetic resin pallet, the articles are sometimes lashed together using a rope.<br><br>
2 [0005]<br>
In the past, in order to lash articles together on the synthetic resin pallet by a rope, a rope is inserted into the fork insertion aperture provided at the side surface of the synthetic resin pallet, and the upper plate part and the articles are fixed. Since it is necessary to insert a rope into the fork insertion aperture, a lot of time and labor are required to fix the articles on the synthetic resin pallet.<br>
In addition, when a rope is inserted into the fork insertion aperture, there is a concern that the rope moves in the fork insertion aperture, the lashing becomes loose due to vibration during transportation of the synthetic resin pallet, and the articles collapse.<br>
Furthermore, there is also a concern that the rope inserted into the fork insertion aperture is damaged by the fork, and the rope is cut. [0006]<br>
A synthetic resin pallet comprising a hook part for hooking the rope at the side part:, as shown in FIG 9, is suggested. In the synthetic resin pallet, it is possible to hook a rope at the hook part, fix articles on the synthetic resin pallet, and transport and store the articles stably.<br>
It is not necessary with the synthetic resin pallet to pass a rope through the fork insertion aperture; therefore, articles can be fixed easily. In addition, since a rope is fixed at the hook part, loosening of the rope is prevented during transportation, and it is possible to prevent collapse of the articles. Furthermore, since the forks do not contact the rope, there is no concern that the rope being cut. [0007]<br>
Furthermore, in the synthetic resin pallet comprising a hook part for hooking the rope at the side thereof, after unpacking, as shown in FIG. 9, the synthetic resin pallet is sometimes stored while the rope is attached.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED [0008]<br>
In a synthetic resin pallet on which articles are not positioned and to which ropes are not used, when the ropes attached in the hook part are tied in a bundle, and the bundle is put on the synthetic resin pallet, a synthetic resin pallet to be stacked is positioned on the ropes and leans. Therefore, there is a problem in that several synthetic resin pallets<br><br>
3<br>
are not stacked stably.<br>
In addition, when the ropes are left on the floor as shown in FIG 9, there is a problem in that the rope is run over and pulled by a forklift or the like and the stacked synthetic resin pallets collapse, the hook part is broken, or the rope is cut. [0009]<br>
In addition, when the rope dangles over the side part of the synthetic resin pallet, the fork insertion aperture is hidden, and it is impossible to insert forks into the fork insertion apertures easily. When synthetic resin pallets are arranged on the floor, the rope dangling over the side part affects the tidy arrangement, and a large space is required to store the synthetic resin pallets.<br>
Furthermore, when a rope is stored in the fork insertion aperture, the rope is not easily recognized from the outside. Therefore, there is a concern that when the forks are inserted into the fork insertion apertures, the forks catch the rope, and the hook part is damaged or the rope is cut. [0010]<br>
In consideration of the above-described problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a synthetic resin pallet which can store safely a rope in a hook part without the need for taking off while the rope is not used.<br>
Means for solving the problem [0011]<br>
The synthetic resin pallet of the present invention comprises an upper plate part and a lower plate part which are positioned so as to face each other, and columns for connecting the upper plate part and the lower plate part, and comprises openings of at least one pair of fork insertion apertures at a side part thereof, wherein hook parts are formed at the side part, and a storage space for storing a rope is formed in the upper plate part.<br>
In the synthetic resin pallet, it is preferable that the storage space be formed by plural ribs formed in the upper plate part and a bottom part connected with the ribs.<br>
In addition, in the synthetic resin pallet, it is preferable that the storage space be formed in the column.<br>
Effects of the present invention<br><br>
4<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention, since the synthetic resin pallet comprises the storage space for storing the rope hooked in the hook part, it is possible to prevent the rope from being left on the floor. Therefore, there is no concern that the rope being run over by a forklift, and it is possible to prevent problems occurring such as damage of the hook part, and cutting of the rope.<br>
Since the rope is stored in the storage space formed in the upper plate part, synthetic resin pallets can be safely stacked. When synthetic resin pallets are arranged on the floor, there is no case where the rope dangles over the side part of the synthetic resin pallet, and it is possible to decrease the volume of storage space required for the synthetic resin pallets.<br>
Furthermore, since there is no case where the rope dangles over the side part of the synthetic resin pallet, it is possible to insert easily the forks into the fork insertion apertures. [0013]<br>
As explained above, according to the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention, it is possible to reliably lash articles onto the synthetic resin pallet using a rope with ease, and to store safely the rope in the hook part while the rope is not being used and hooked to the hook part.<br>

EXAMPLES [0018]<br>
Below, a preferred embodiment of the synthetic resin pallet according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the figures.<br>
FIGS. 1 through 7 show the preferred embodiment of the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG 1, a synthetic resin pallet 11 has a substantial box shape having a rectangular cross-section, and comprises an upper plate part 12 forming an upper surface of the synthetic resin pallet 11, a lower plate part 13 forming a lower surface, and columns 14 connecting the upper plate part 12 and the lower plate part 13. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 4, the upper plate part 12 and the lower plate part 13 are positioned in parallel substantially. [0019]<br>
The synthetic resin pallet 11 is made of olefins such as polyethylene, and polypropylene, for example. The synthetic resin pallet 11 is formed by contacting and heat-adhering an upper member comprising the upper plate part 12 and the columns 14 which are integrally molded and a lower member comprising the lower plate part 13 and the columns 14 which are integrally molded such that the columns 14 provided with the upper member and the columns 14 provided with the lower member are in contact.<br>
Alternatively, the synthetic resin pallet 11 may be formed by integrally molding the upper plate part 12, the lower plate part 13, and the columns 14. [0020]<br>
Two pairs of fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, and 22 and 22 to be inserted with forks of a forklift or a pallet truck are formed between the columns 14 and 14 in the synthetic resin pallet 11 having such a structure. The fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 extending in a longitudinal direction of the synthetic resin pallet 11 comprise openings 21A and 21A at both short side side-parts 15. The other insertion apertures 22 and 22 extending in a transversal direction to the longitudinal direction comprise openings 22A and 22A at both long side side-parts 15. That is, the synthetic resin pallet 11 shown in figures is a so-called four-direction synthetic resin pallet. In the synthetic resin pallet 11, the short side-side parts 15 comprising the columns 14 and the openings 21A and 21A of<br><br>
7<br>
the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 and the long side-side parts 15 comprising the columns 14 and the openings 22 A and 22 A of the fork insertion apertures 22 and 22 are arranged in contact and thereby a side part 15 of the synthetic resin pallet 11 is formed. The side part 15 surrounds the periphery of the upper and lower plate parts. [0021]<br>
In the lower plate part 13, plural crosspieces 23 and 23 are provided so as to have an interval in an orthogonal direction to the insertion direction of the forks of a forklift or a pallet truck at the bottom region of the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, that is, the regions between the columns 14 and 14. Similarly, plural crosspieces 24 and 24 are also provided so as to have an interval in an orthogonal direction to the insertion direction of the forks of a forklift or a pallet truck at the bottom region of the fork insertion apertures 22 and 22, that is, the regions between the columns 14 and 14.<br>
Moreover, the height of the crosspieces 23 and 23 provided at the bottom of the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 comprising the openings 21A and 21A at the short side-side part 15 is lower than the height of the crosspieces 24 and 24 provided at the bottom of the fork insertion apertures 22 and 22 comprising the openings 22 A and 22 A at the long side-side part 15. [0022]<br>
In addition, in the lower plate part 13, plural holes for a wheel 25, which connect the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, are formed at the region surrounded by the columns 14. When forks of a pallet truck are inserted into the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, the wheels provided with the forks make contact with the ground via the holes for the wheel 25. In the synthetic resin pallet 11 of this example, since four holes for the wheel 25 are provided, the lower plate part 13 has a square frame comprising a cross frame therein by the crosspieces 23 and 24. [0023]<br>
The upper face of the synthetic resin pallet 11, that is, the surface of the upper plate part 12, is a surface to be loaded. In order to stably put articles on the synthetic resin pallet 11, the surface is flat. As shown in FIG. 1, the upper plate part 12 comprises plural lattice-shaped ribs 16 for reinforcing the region among the columns 14. Due to these lattice-shaped ribs 16, plural rectangular spaces 17 having a size from small to large are formed.<br><br>
8<br>
In addition, protrusions are formed at the corners of the upper plate part 12. The lower plate part 13 comprises recesses at positions in which the protrusions are put when the synthetic resin pallets 11 are stacked. The synthetic resin pallets 11 can be stacked stably without displacement by forming the protrusions at the corners of the upper plate part 12 having a square shape and the recesses in which the protrusions are put at the lower plate part 13. [0024]<br>
A hook part 18 for hooking a rope R in the column 14 is positioned in the side part 15 surrounding the periphery of the upper and lower plate parts 12 and 13. As shown in FIG 4, the hook part: 18 comprises a recessed part 19 which is formed by hollowing in the side part 15 amd has a substantial square shape in cross-section, and an arrow part 20 which extends perpendicularly from the side of the upper plate part 12 toward the lower side. A hook for preventing loosing of the rope R is provided at the tip of the arrow part 20.<br>
The hook part 18 is formed at the columns 14 in the four side parts 15 comprising the synthetic resin pallet 11 such that the hook parts 18 are positioned symmetrically at two sides facing each other. [0025]<br>
A storage space 31 for storing the rope R hooked at the hook part 18 is formed in the upper plate part 12. In the synthetic resin pallet in this example, the storage space 31 is formed at a position which is opposite to the hook part 18 relative to the side part 15, and specifically, the storage space 31 is formed in the column 14. The storage space 31 has a substantially rectangular tubular shape having a bottom, and for example, has the same shape as the rectangular spaces 17 having no bottom. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the storage space 31 is formed by four side walls 32 which are ribs and a bottom part 33 which the four side walls 32 connect to and is positioned parallel to the lower plate part 13. A drain hole 34 is formed in the side walls 32 and the bottom part 33. [0026]<br>
As explained above, the storage space 31 comprises the bottom part 33; however, as shown in FIG. 7, the rectangular spaces 17 other than the storage space 31 are formed only by the ribs 16, which extend downwardly from the upper plate part 12 or upwardly from the lower plate part 13, and do not comprise the bottom part 33. [0027]<br><br>
9<br>
It is possible to transport and store articles in a bulk by loading the articles on the surface of the upper plate part 12 of the synthetic resin pallet 11 having such a structure, inserting forks of a forklift or a pallet truck into a pair of the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, and transporting the articles together with the synthetic resin pallet 11 to the bed of a truck or a storage area. [0028]<br>
In this case, the forks of the forklift are inserted into the fork insertion apertures 22 and 22 comprising the openings 22A and 22A at the long side-side part 15, and then the synthetic resin pallet 11 is transported.<br>
In contrast, the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 comprising the openings 21A and 21A at the short side-side part 15 are provided with lower crosspieces 23 and 23, as explained above. Due to the height of the crosspieces 23 and 23, even a pallet truck provided with forks comprising wheels at the tips thereof can override easily the crosspiece 23. Thereby, the wheels of the pallet truck make contact with the ground, and the pallet can be transported using the pallet truck.<br>
In other words, the fork insertion apertures 22 and 22 having the openings 22A and 22A at the long side-side part 15 are suitably used for a forklift, and the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 having the openings 21A and 21A are suitably used for a pallet truck or forklift, in particular, for a pallet truck. [0029]<br>
Below, the operation for lashing articles together on the synthetic resin pallet 11 using a rope R will be explained. FIG. 8 shows the synthetic resin pallet 11 on which articles are lashed together using a rope R.<br>
In order to fix the articles on the synthetic resin pallet 11 with the rope R, at first, for example, a loop formed at one end of the rope R is inserted in the recessed part 19 and hooked to the arrow part 20. [0030]<br>
The rope R used in this example has a belt shape having a substantially flat cross-section. However, of course, a rope having a circular cross-section can also be used.<br>
Then, the rope R having a loop at one end is laced on the articles on the synthetic resin pallet 11, the other end of the rope R is hooked in the hook part 18 formed at the side part 15 opposite to the side part 15 at which the loop was previously hooked,<br><br>
10<br>
and the rope is pulled upward, and then the remaining rope R is clasped with a clasp not<br>
shown in figures, and thereby the rope R is strained.<br>
[0031]<br>
Since the synthetic resin pallet 11 comprises the storage space 31 formed in the upper plate part 12. Therefore, after unlacing, the rope R of which the other end is hooked to the hook part 18 is bundled into a fist size, and stored in the storage space 31, it is possible to prevent leaving the rope R on the floor. Due to this, it is possible to prevent problems such as collapse of stacked synthetic resin pallets occurring by running over and pulling the rope R left on the floor by a forklift, breakage of the hook part 18, cutting of the rope R, etc.<br>
In particular, when the hook part 18 and the storage space 31 are connected, the rope R is stored by pushing into the storage space 31 via the recessed part 19. Therefore, when plural synthetic resin pallets are stacked, the rope R is stored in the synthetic pallets 11 which are not positioned at the top.<br>
Since the rope R is stored in the synthetic resin pallet 11, when the synthetic resin pallets 11 are stacked or arranged on the floor, the rope R does not affect a tidy arrangement, and a space required to store the synthetic resin pallets 11 decreases. In particular, when the rope is flat, the synthetic resin pallets 11 are more stably stacked, and a space required to store the synthetic resin pallets 11 more decreases. [0032]<br>
Since the storage spaces 31 comprise the bottom part 33, when the rope R is stored in the storage spaces 31, the rope R does not protrude to the fork insertion apertures 21,21,22 and 22 or the floor, and the rope R is reliably stored.<br>
In addition, since the storage space 31 is formed in the column 14 and extends to about the lower plate part 13, the capacity of the storage space 31 is enough to store reliably even a relatively long rope R. [0033]<br>
Furthermore, since the drain hole 34 is formed at the bottom part 33 and the side walls of the storage space 33, water does not accumulate in the storage space 31, and thereby it is possible to prevent permeation of water into the rope R and slipping of hands while lashing articles together. [0034]<br>
The preferred example of the synthetic resin pallet 11 of the present invention<br><br>
11<br>
was explained above. However, the present invention is not limited to the above example, and the constitution of the synthetic resin pallet according to the present invention can be changed as long as the change of the constitution is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, the storage space 31 has a rectangular cross section in the example; however, this is not limited to this shape, and may have a triangular, pentagonal, or circular cross-section. [0035]<br>
In addition, a synthetic resin pallet which comprises a pair of fork insertion apertures extending along in two directions and to which the forks can be inserted from four directions, that is, a so-called four-direction synthetic resin pallet is explained in this example. However, the present invention is not limited to this example. The synthetic resin pallet of the present invention may be a synthetic resin pallet which comprises a pair of the fork insertion apertures extending along in one direction and to which the forks can be inserted from two directions, that is, so-called two-direction synthetic resin pallet.<br>
Industrial applicability [0036]<br>
According to the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention, since the storage space stores the rope hooked to the hook part, it is possible to prevent unused rope from lying on the floor. Therefore, since there is no concern that the rope being run over by a forklift, it is possible to prevent problems such as breakage of the hook part, and cutting of the rope, etc.<br>
In addition, since the rope is stored in the storage space in the upper plate part, it is possible to stack stably the synthetic resin pallets. When the synthetic resin pallets are arranged on the floor, the rope does not dangle over and disturb the arrangement, and thereby a space required to store the synthetic resin pallets 11 decreases.<br>
In addition, according to the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention, since the rope does not dangle over the side part, the forks are easily inserted into the fork insertion apertures.<br>
As explained above, the present invention provides a synthetic resin pallet which can reliably and simply be used to lash articles on the synthetic resin pallet using a rope,<br><br>
12<br>
and which is stored stably by hooking the rope to the hook part when the rope is not used.<br><br>
