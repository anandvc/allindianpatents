				<td>BROMO-PHENYL SUBSTITUTED THIAZOLYL DIHVDROPYRIMIDINES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001]	The invention relates to a new bromo-phenyl substituted thiazolyl<br>
dihydropyrimidine, its preparation method and use as a medicament especially for treating and preventing hepatitis B infections. The invention also relates to a composition comprising the dihydropyrimidine, other antiviral agent and, when appropriate, an immunomodulator and a medicament comprising the composition especially for treating and preventing HBV infections such as hepatitis B infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]        The hepatitis B virus belongs to the family of hepadna viruses. It can cause acute and/or persistent or progressive chronic diseases.   Many other clinical manifestations in the pathological state are also caused by the hepatitis B virusâ€”in particular chronic inflammation of the liver, cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, coinfection with the heptatitis delta virus may have adverse effects on the progress of the disease.<br>
[003]        The interferon and lamivudine are conventional medicaments approved to be<br>
used for treating chronic hepatitis. However, the interferon has just moderate activity but has<br>
an adverse side reaction. Although lamivudine has good activity, its resistance develops	I<br>
rapidly during the treatment and relapse effects often appear after the treatment is stopped. The ICsn value of lamivudine (S-TC) is 300 nM (Science, 299 (2003), 893-896).<br>
[004]        U.S. Patent No. 7,074,784 discloses 6-amidoalkyldihydropyriraidine and its use as a medicament especially for treating and preventing hepatitis B infection.<br>
[005]        It is described in Example 12 of U.S. Patent No. 7,074,784 that R' is o-chlorine, R- is p-chlorine, R"^ is 3,5-difluoro-pyridin-2-yl, X is -CH2- and Z is morpholinyl. The compound can inhibit the growth of hepatitis B virus during cell culturing. The ICso value is 2 nM (tested by themselves).<br>
 <br>
[006]        The main substitution in Example 12 is replacing bis-chlorine with R' (o-bromine) and R^ (p-fluorine), which results in the ICso of Compound 9 being 7 nM (described in Example 9 of the patent). And when the main substituents are changed into R' (o-chlorine) and R^ (p-fluorine), an approximate IC.so value is also obtained (IC50 =2-4 nM in Example 5).<br>
[007]        It is indicated that the ICso value cannot increase with the variation of the main substituents R' and R^ (see Table 1).<br>
[008]        U.S. Patent No. 7,074,784 B2 also discloses an example, wherein a difluoro residue is substituted for thiazol-2-yl (described in Example 45 of the patent). The derivative ha.s a similar IC50 value (2 nM) (see Table 1).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[009]	We have surprisingly discovered that a derivative with an activity of 10 times<br>
higher and the IC.so value of less than 1 nM can be obtained by substituting with thiazol-2-yl and changing the main substituents into R'=o-bromine and R^=p-fluorine,   This is unexpected when reading US 7,074,784 (see Table 2).<br>
 <br>
wherein R' is o-bromine, R^ is p-fluorine, R^ is C1-C4 alkyl, R* is thiazol-2-yl, X is methylene and Z is morpholinyl.<br>

[0016]      The physiologically acceptable salt can also be a metal salt or an ammonium salt of the compound of the invention.   In a preferred example, it is a sodium salt, potassium salt, magnesium salt or calcium .salt, and an ammonium salt produced by ammonia or organic amine such as ethylamine, diethylamine or triethylamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethyl alcohol, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine or 2-phenylethylamine, etc.<br>

[0021]      As a starting material, P-keto carboxylate (III) is well-known, or can be prepared by known methods published in the literature [for example, D. Borrmann, "Umsetzung von Diketen mit Alkoholen, Phenolen und Mercaptanen", in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Houben-Weyl), vol. VII/4,230 ff (1968); Y. CMkawa, K. Sugano und 0. Yonemitsu, J. Org. Chem. 43, 2087 (1978)].<br>

[0032]      Thereby, this invention also relates to a composition for treating and preventing HBV infections and its use for treating diseases induced by HBV.<br>
[0033]      The use of the combinations of the invention provides valuable advantages for the treatment of HBV-induced diseases compared with monotherapy with the individual compounds, namely principally a synergistic antiviral activity, but also good tolerability of the combinations of the invention in Tox-50 (the range of toxicity at which 50% of the cells survive).<br>
 <br>
[0034]       The substances referred to as HBV polymerase inhibitors B for the purposes of the invention are those which, in the endogenous polymerase assay which was published by Ph. A. Furman et al. in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Vol. 36 (No. 12), 2688 (1992) and which is described hereinafter, lead to an inhibition of the formation of an HBV DNA double strand, so as to result in a maximum of 50% of the activity of the zero value.<br>
[0035]       HBV polymerase inhibitors B for use in the invention are the substances disclosed in the endogenous polymerase experiment published in "Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy" Vol.36 (No. 12), 2688 (1992) by Ph. A. Furman, and the substances described below for inhibiting the formation of double-stranded HBV DNA thereby resulting in the maximum 50% activity value to be zero.<br>
[0036]       HBV virions from culture supernatants incorporate nucleoside 5'-triphosphates into the plus strand of the HBV DNA in vitro.   By using agarose gel electrophoresis, the incorporation of [a-^^P]-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate into the viral 3.2 kb DNA product is observed in the presence and absence of a substance potentially having HBV polymerase-inhibiting properties. HBV virions are obtained from the cell culture supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells by precipitation with polyethyleneglycol and are concentrated.   One part by volume of clarified cell culture supernatant is mixed with 1/4 by volume of an aqueous solution containing 50% by weight polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.6 M sodium chloride. The virions are sedimented by centrifugation at 2500xg/15 minutes. The sediments are resuspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 0.05 M tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and dialyzed against the same buffer containing 100 mM potassium chloride.   The samples can be frozen at -80Â° C. Each reaction mixture (100 \iX) contains at least 105 HBV virions; 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 300 mM potassium chloride; 50 mM magnesium chloride; 0.1% Nonident* P-40 (nonionic detergent from Boehringer Mannheim); 10 ^M dATP, 10 ^M dGTP, 10 \M dTTP; 10 \iC\ [â€¢'^P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; final concentration 33 nM) and 1 nM of the potential polymerase inhibitor in its triphosphorylated form. The samples are incubated at 37Â° C for one hour and then the reaction is stopped by adding 50 mM EDTA. A 10% weight/volume SDS solution<br>
 <br>
(containing 10 g of SDS per 90 ml of water) is added to a final concentration of 1% by volume (based on the total volume), and proteinase K is added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After incubation at 37Â° C for one hour, samples are extracted with the same volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (ratio 25:24:1 by volume), and the DNA is precipitated from the aqueous phase with ethanol. The DNA pellet is resuspended in 10 JAI of gel buffer (solution of 10.8 g of tris, 5.5 g of boric acid and 0.75 g of EDTA in 1 liter of water (=TBE buffer)) and separated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel. Either the gel is dried or the nucleic acids present therein transferred by the Southern transfer technique to a membrane. The amount of labeled DNA double strand formed is then determined in relation to the negative control (=endo-pol reaction without substance or with inactive control substance). An HBV polymerase inhibitor is present if a maximum of 50% of the activity of the negative control is present.<br>

 <br>
[0041]       Preferred immunomodulators C) comprise, for example, all interferons such as a-, P- and y-interferons, in particular also a-2a- and a-2b-interferons, interleukins such as<br>
 <br>
interleukin-2, polypeptides such asthymosin-a-1 and thymoctonan, imidazoquinoline derivatives such as LevamisoleÂ®, immunoglobulins and therapeutic vaccines.<br>
[0042]      A further preferred embodiment of the invention relates to combinations of A) above dihydropyrimidines (I) and (la), B) lamivudine and, where appropriate, C) an interferon.<br>
Description of Tests<br>
[0043]      The antiviral action of the compounds of the invention on hepatitis B virus is investigated by methods based on those described by M. A. Sells et ai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. 84, 1005-1009 (1987) and B. E. Korba et ai, Antiviral Research 19, 55-70 (1992).<br>
[0044]      The antiviral tests are carried out in 96-well microtiter plates. The first vertical row of the plate receives only growth medium and HepG2.2.15 cells. It serves as virus control.<br>
[0045]      Stock solutions of the test compounds (50 mM) are initially dissolved in DMSO, and further dilutions are prepared in the HepG2.2.15 growth medium. The compounds according to the invention are usually pipetted in a test concentration of 100 ^M (1st test concentration) in each case into the second vertical test row of the microtiter plate and subsequently diluted in twofold steps 210 times in growth medium plus 2% by weight of fetal calf serum (volume 25 \i\)<br>
[0046]      Each well of the microtiter plate then contains 225 ^l of HepG2.2.15 cell suspension (5x104 cells/ml) in growth medium plus 2% by weight of fetal calf serum. The test mixture is incubated at 37Â° C and 5% C02 (v/v) for 4 days.<br>
[0047]      The supernatant is then aspirated off and discarded, and the wells receive 225 ^il of freshly prepared growth medium. The compounds according to the invention are each added anew as 10-fold concentrated solution in a volume of 25 ^il. The mixtures are incubated for a further 4 days<br>
[0048]       Before harvesting the supernatants to determine the antiviral effect, the HepG2.2.15 cells are examined under the light microscope or by means of biochemical<br>
 <br>
detection methods (for example Alamar Blue stain or Trypan Blue stain) for cytotoxic changes<br>
[0049]      The supernatant and/or cells are then harvested and sucked by means of a vacuum onto 96-well dot-blot chambers covered with a nylon membrane (in accordance with the manufacturer's information).<br>
Cytotoxicity Determination<br>
[0050]       Substance-induced cytotoxic or cytostatic changes in the HepG2.2,15 cells are detected, for example, under the light microscope as changes in cell morphology. Such substance-induced changes in the HepG2.2.15 cells compare with untreated cells are visible, for example, as cytolysis, vacuolation or altered cell morphology. A 50% cytotoxicity (Tox.-50) means that 50% of the cells show a morphology comparable to the corresponding cell control.<br>
[0051] The tolerability of some of the compounds according to the invention is additionally tested on other host cells such as, for example, HeLa cells, primary human peripheral blood cells or transformed cell lines such as H-9 cells.<br>
[0052]      No cytotoxic changes are detectable at concentrations &gt;10 jiM of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Determination of the Antiviral Action<br>
[0053]      After the supernatants or lysed cells is transferred to the nylon membrane of the blot apparatus (see above), the intra- or extracellular supernatants of the HepG2.2.15 cells are denatured (1.5 M NaCl/0.5 N NaOH), neutralized (3 M NaCl/0.5M Tris HCl, pH 7.5) and washed (2xSSC). The DNA is then baked onto the membrane by incubating the filters at 120Â° C for 2-4 hours.<br>
DNA Hybridization<br>

[0054]       Detection of the viral DNA from the treated HepG2.2.15 cells on the nylon filters is usually carried out with nonradioactive, digoxigenin-labeled hepatitis B-specific DNA probes, each of which is labeled with digoxigenin, purified and employed for the hybridization in accordance with the manufacturer's information.<br>
[0055]       The prehybridization and hybridization take place in SxSSC, Ixblocking reagent, 0.1% by weight N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% by weight SDS and 100 \ig of herring sperm DNA. The prehybridization takes place at 60Â° C for 30 minutes, and the specific hybridization takes place with 20 to 40 ng/ml of the digoxigenized, denatured HBV-specific DNA (14 hours, 60" C), The filters are then washed.<br>
Detection of HBV-DNA'by Digoxigenin Antibodies<br>
[0056]      The immunological detection of the digoxigenin-labeled DNA took place in accordance with the manufacturer's information:<br>
[0057]      The filters were washed and prehybridized in a blocking reagent (in accordance with the manufacturer's information). Hybridization was then carried out with an anti-DIG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase for 30 minutes. After a washing step, the substrate of alkaline phosphatase, CSPD, was added, incubated with the filters for 5 minutes, then packed in plastic film and incubated at 37* C for a further 15 minutes. The chemiluminescence of the hepatitis B-specific DNA signals was visualized by exposing the filters to an X-ray film (incubation depending on signal strength:,10 minutes to 2 hours).<br>
[0058]      The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (ICso, 50% inhibitory concentration) was determined as the coricentration at which the intra- or extracellular hepatitis B-specific band was reduced by the compound according to the invention by 50% compared with an untreated sample.<br>
[0059]      It is unexpected that the compound of the invention exhibits an effective antiviral effect with an ICjo less than 1 nM. Therefore, the compound of the invention is suitable for use in treating the diseases induced by viruses, especially acute and chronic<br>
 <br>
persistent HBV infections. Chronic viral diseases induced by HBV can worsen the morbidity and the chronic hepatitis B virus infection can cause liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in many cases.<br>

[0065]       Component C, which is also to be used where appropriate, may be used in amounts of, preferably, 1 to 10 million, in particular 2 to 7 million, I.U. (international units), about three times a week over a period of up to one year.<br>
[0066] The compounds or compositions of the invention are intended to be present in the pharmaceutical preparations mentioned above in general in a concentration of about 0.1 to 99.5, preferably about 0.5 to 95, % by weight of the complete mixture.<br>
 <br>
[0067]      The pharmaceutical preparations mentioned above can be produced in a conventional way by known methods, for example by mixing the active ingredient(s) with the carrier(s).<br>
[0068]      It has generally proved to be advantageous both in human and in veterinary medicine to administer the active ingredient(s) in total amounts of about 0.5 to about 500, preferably of 1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight every 24 hours, where appropriate in the form of a plurality of single doses, to achieve the desired results.
