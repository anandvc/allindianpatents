				<td>A mat and methods for the manufacture of glass fiber reinforced plastics or carbon<br>
fiber reinforced plastics<br>
The invention relates to a mat for use in a method for the manufacture of glass fiber<br>
reinforced plastics or carbon fiber reinforced plastics and to methods for the<br>
manufacture of glass fiber reinforced plastics or carbon fiber reinforced plastics<br>
using this new mat.<br>
Various methocs of manufacture are known for glass fiber reinforced plastics or<br>
carbon fiber reinforced plastics. In addition to manual lamination in which unheated<br>
open molds, for example wooden molds, are used as the mold, vacuum processes<br>
or also centrifugal processes have gained acceptance.<br>
A centrifugal method in accordance with the prior art is explained schematically in<br>
Figure 1. Resin-impregnated laminate 12. which is surrounded by a peel-ply 14<br>
which, as such, is permeable to gas and liquid, is there placed onto a drum 10<br>
rotating in the direction of the arrow a. This first peel-ply 14 is surrounded by a<br>
second peel-ply 16 which consists of a polyamide fabric. When the drum 10 is spun<br>
in the direction of the arrow a, excess resin is expelled from the resin-impregnated<br>
laminate coating 12 and passes through the first peel-ply to penetrate into the<br>
second peel-ply 16. Due to the fabric structure of this fabric layer, consisting for<br>
example of polyamide, resin is expelled during the spinning and contaminates the<br>
vicnity of the centrifuge apparatus. After the hardening of the resin, it is usually very<br>
difficult to separate the peel-ply, which is in another respect rigid and less flexible,<br>
from the peel-ply 14 on the drum 10.<br>
In Figure 3, another manufacturing process for a glass fiber reinforced plastic or a<br>
carbon fiber reinforced plastic is shown schematically. A mold 102 is placed on a<br>
table 100 here and resin-impregnated laminate 104 has been layered onto or into it.<br>
A peel-ply 106 has been laid around the resin-impregnated laminate 104. The peel-<br>
ply 106 is surrounded by a permeable separating foil 108. This is in turn surrounded<br>
by means of an absorbing layer 110. The absorbing layer 110 is in turn enveloped<br>
by means of a gas-tight foil 112 which is sealed to the side via seals 114. Vacuum<br>
suction devices 116 are provided inside the gas-tight foil 112 and the vacuum can<br>
be applied via these. This vacuum is distributed uniformly through the absorbing<br>
layer 110 such that excess resin from the laminate 104 is transported into the<br>
absorbing layer 110 via the air-permeable and liquid-permeable peel-ply 106 and<br>
via the permeable separating foil 108. After hardening the glass fiber reinforced<br>
plastic or carbon fiber reinforced plastic, the individual foils can be separated from<br>
the laminate 104 comparatively easily in the present method, in particular due to the<br>
permeable separating foil 108. The assembly present here for the carrying out of<br>
the method is, however, comparatively complex and expensive since a series of<br>
different layers have to be applied to the laminate 104.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a new mat for use in a method for the<br>
manufacture of glass fiber reinforced plastics or carbon fiber reinforced plastics with<br>
which these methods can be simplified and made cheaper.<br>
Th s object is solved in accordance with the invention by a mat for use in a method<br>
for the manufacture of glass fiber reinforced plastics or carbon fiber reinforced<br>
plastics in accordance with claim 1. A mat is provided here as a layer for the<br>
absorption of excess resin expelled during the manufacturing process which<br>
consists of thermally bonded plastic fibers, with at least one side of the mat having<br>
a solidified surface with a smaller pore size in comparison to the remaining pore<br>
size of the mat. This mat has a series of advantages. It can be used either in a<br>
centrifugal method or in a vacuum method for the manufacture of glass fiber<br>
reinforced plastics or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. It has been found that the<br>
mats in accordance with the invention can store the discharged resin ideally when<br>
used in the centrifugal method. After hardening the resin, they can be easily<br>
separated from the peel-ply of the drum due to their solidified surface with a small<br>
pore size. Even with the absorbed and hardened resin, the mat in accordance with<br>
the invention is so flexible that it can be rolled up and so handled easily.<br>
When used in the vacuum method, the mat can replace two layers, namely the<br>
permeable separating foil and the absorbing layer arranged above this. The<br>
permeable separating film, which is to be provided separately, can be replaced due<br>
to the solidified surface properties of smaller pore sizes. This surface namely<br>
makes it possible to peel of the mat in a simple manner from the first peel-ply which<br>
is arranged directly over the resin-impregnated laminate.<br>
Particularly advantageous aspects of the mat in accordance, with the invention<br>
result from the dependent claims 2 to 9 following the main claim.<br>
Accordingly, the mat can have a basis weight from 50 g/m2 up to 1000 g/m2. A mat<br>
having a basis weight from 100 g/m2 up to 600 g/m2 is particularly preferred. !t<br>
furhermore has a preferable thickness from 0.3 mm up to 12 mm.<br>
Fir ally, the mat in accordance with the invention consists of polypropylene,<br>
polyester and/or polyamide fibers or of mixtures of these materials.<br>
If the fibers forming the mat have been manufactured in a melt-blown method , they<br>
advantageously have 0.01 dtex up to 0.5 dtex (microfibers). If they are<br>
manufactured in a different method, they preferably have 0.8 dtex up to 20 dtex.<br><br>
The mats can consist of fine fibers or the mats can consist either of thick fibers or of<br>
a mixture of thick and fine fibers. The fine fibers permit the manufacture of mats<br>
having a fine pore size, whereas the thick fibers serve for mats with a good<br>
absorption property. These properties can advantageously be combined in mat<br>
production, for instance for the manufacture of multi-ply mats, for example, with the<br>
individual layers consisting of fibers of different thicknesses.<br>
This invention further relates to a centrifugal method in accordance with claim 10<br>
and to a vacuum method in accordance with claim 11.<br>
Details and advantages of the invention will be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to two embodiments shown in the drawing.<br>
There are shown:<br>
Figure 1: a schematic representation of a centrifugal method in accordance with<br>
the prior art;<br>
Figure 2: a schematic representation of a centrifugal method to illustrate a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 3 a schematic representation of a vacuum method in accordance with the<br>
prior art; and<br>
Figure 4 a schematic representation of a vacuum method in accordance with a<br>
further embodiment of the present invention in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
A centrifugal process is shown schematically in Figure 2 which substantially<br>
corresponds to that already described in accordance with Figure 1. Here, however,<br>
a layer consisting of a mat 18 is provided instead of the outer layer of polyamide<br><br>
fabric 16 as is used in accordance with the prior art in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
The layer 18 consists of a mat which has been manufactured from thermally<br>
bonded plastic fibers, with at least one side of the mat having a solidified surface<br>
with a pore size which is smaller than the pore size of the remaining mat. This<br>
sol dified surface permits a particularly favorable interface property with respect to<br>
the first peel-ply 14 which, as such, is liquid permeable and gas permeable. Due to<br>
the correspondingly set pore size, the resin.is thus here held back in the laminate<br>
12, on the one hand, and some is absorbed into the mat and stored there, on the<br>
other hand. On the other hand, due to the solidified surface with a small pore size, a<br>
removal of the mat 18 from the peel-ply 14 is possible without problem. Due to the<br>
properties of the mat, it can also be rolled up with the resin absorbed and stored in<br>
the mat and so can be easily disposed of. It is particularly advantageous that no<br>
unwanted resin edges form on the surface of the hardened glass fiber reinforced<br>
plastic 12 or carbon fiber reinforced plastic 12. The circular drum 10 shown in the<br>
representation 2 can also be another mold of any desired shape.<br>
A vacuum method is shown schematically in Figure 4 using the mat in accordance<br>
with the invention. This substantially corresponds to that in accordance with Figure<br>
3, which was previously described as the prior art. However, the permeable<br>
separating foil 108 and the absorbing layer 110 are here replaced by the mat 120.<br>
On the one hand, the permeable separating foil 108 in accordance with Figure 3<br>
and the absorbing layer 110 in accordance with Figure 3 are here replaced by a<br>
single layer, namely the mat 120. The handling is hereby substantially simplified, on<br>
the one hand. The new method is also more cost-favorable than the multi-ply<br>
method in accordance with the prior art. Due to the pore structure of the mat, a very<br>
good distribution of the vacuum over the whole laminate structure 104 is ensured,<br>
on the one hand. The excess resin is absorbed over an equal area, on the other<br>
hand. A smooth and regular surface without corners and edges or faults in the glass<br>
fiber reinforced plastic component or carbon fiber reinforced plastic component to<br>
be shaped is hereby ensured.<br><br>
The mat 120 or 18 is mainly manufactured from thermoplastic fibers made of<br>
polypropylene, polyester, polyamide and/or copolymers of these materials. Staple<br>
fibers, endless fibers, bicomponent fibers or mixtures thereof are used. The<br>
manufacturing method of the mat as such is known and will therefore not be<br>
explained again in detail here. A customary mat, a needle mat, a spun-bonded mat,<br>
a melt-blown mat, an air-laid mat can be used alone or in combination as the mat<br>
120 or 18. It is important that one side of the mat has a solidified surface with a<br>
comparatively smaller pore size. This solidification can be created, for example, by<br>
heat treatment of the surface or also by other method steps.<br>
With the mat 120 or 18 in accordance with the invention, a very good flexibility<br>
results in the absorption capacity for the excess resin by adaptation of the basis<br>
weight of the mat 120 or 18 or by overlapping a plurality of layers of the mat. More<br>
absorption volume to accept the excess resin can thus be made available by the<br>
correspondingly selected basis weight or by a multiple layer of the mat.<br>
