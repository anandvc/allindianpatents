				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to ,an electrical device<br><br>
comprising a front coverand a housing which is provided with a snap<br>
fastening for snapping onto a mounting rail.<br>
A device of the generic type is known from DE<br>
296 06 759 U1. This discloses a multi-part housing of<br>
modular design for receiving a printed circuit board.<br>
What they have in mind here is a multi-part housing for<br>
low-voltage switchgear, such as for example time-lag<br>
relays or thermistor protection devices, for receiving<br>
a printed circuit board. Here, the housing is divided<br>
parallel to the mounting plane into a lower and upper<br>
housing part. The printed circuit board is designed<br>
such that it is graduated in a step-shaped manner along<br>
two mutually opposite edges and is equipped with<br>
connection plugs for the fitting on of screw terminals<br>
designed in block form in the region of the step-shaped<br>
graduations. The connection plugs have not only<br>
contact pins but also fastening pins, which may be made<br>
in the form of hook-shaped lockable fastening pins.<br>
DE 30 26 247 C2 discloses a housing which can<br>
be arranged in series and is intended for mounting on a<br>
supporting rail. A circuit board, on the edges of<br>
which electrical connection elements are arranged, can<br>
be inserted into the housing. The connection elements<br>
protrude partially out of the openings in the housing.<br>
Here, the housing is divided perpendicularly with<br>
respect to the mounting direction, in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the housing.<br>
The invention is based on the object of<br>
providing an electrical device of the type mentioned<br>
above for creating a housing of a simple, low-cost<br>
construction which is easy to assemble and comprises<br>
few parts. The object is achieved by the housing being<br><br>
composed of two housing shells of identical<br>
construction which are assembled mirror-invertedly with respect to each other.<br>
A particularly advantageous development of the<br>
invention is for the two housing shells to be connected<br>
to each other by formed-on catch elements.<br>
A particularly simple configuration minimizing<br>
the number of details is achieved if the snap fastening<br>
is realized by two resilient catch hooks, of which in<br>
each case one is integrated respectively in one housing<br>
shell.<br>
The configuration with two housing shells of<br>
identical construction which can be assembled mirror-<br>
invertedly with respect to each other can be achieved<br>
if the two housing shells in the assembled state form a<br>
separating gap which leads through the axes of symmetry<br>
of two mutually opposite side walls and outside the<br>
resilient catch hooks. <br>
A particularly advantageous configuration of<br>
the connection terminals, in particular their<br>
connection, is obtained if there is mounted in the<br>
space inside the housing a printed circuit board with<br>
at least two terminal insulators, which are snap-fitted<br>
into the printed circuit board and the connection lugs<br>
of which, belonging to connection terminals, are in<br>
electrical connection with the printed circuit board by<br>
means of soldering.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if connection<br>
terminals are integrated in the electrical device and,<br>
for adding further connection terminals, on one side<br>
wall of the two housing shells there can respectively<br>
be clipped on a terminal block with connection<br>
terminals, into which connection lugs protruding out of<br>
the housing from terminal insulators slide during<br>
clipping on. <br>
A further advantageous design of the invention<br>
is for the switchgear to have on the front side at<br>
least one knob, as a setting element, with an adjusting<br><br>
securement inasmuch as a mechanically coded plate can<br>
be clipped onto the knob, the mechanical coding of the<br>
plate corresponding to a specific setting of the knob.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is<br>
explained in more detail below with reference to a<br>
drawing, in which: <br>
FIGURE 1 shows a perspective view of a housing<br>
which can be fitted together from two housing shells of<br>
identical construction, 	<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a perspective view of an<br>
inventive electrical device in a partially open state,<br>
FIGURE 3 shows a perspective view of a terminal<br>
insulator,		<br>
FIGURE 4 shows a Sside view of the terminal<br>
insulator according to FIGURE 3,<br>
FIGURE 5 shows a perspective view of a plate<br>
serving as an adjusting securement and<br>
FIGURE 6 shows a perspective view of an<br>
electrical device with a front cover which can be lead-<br>
sealed.<br>
Represented in FIGURE 1 are two housing shells<br>
1 of identical construction and lying mirror-invertedly<br>
with respect to each other, which can be fitted<br>
together by means of catch elements 3, 4 at their edges<br>
to form a housing 2 of an electrical device according<br>
to the invention. As usual, the catch elements 3, 4<br>
comprise formed-on catch hooks 3 and adapted clearances<br>
4. For stabilizing the fitted-together housing 2 and<br>
for easier assembly, the housing shells 1 have at their<br>
edges tabs 5, which on the one hand make assembly<br>
easier on account of their guiding function and on the<br>
other hand have a stabilizing effect on account of the<br>
overlap with side walls of the respectively other<br>
housing shell 1. On the side walls of the housing<br>
shells 1 forming the rear wall of the housing 2 there<br>
is respectively formed a resilient catch hook 6. They<br>
serve for the snap fastening of the housing 2 on a<br>
mounting rail and make demounting possible without a<br><br>
tool being required. The resilient catch hook 6<br>
integrated in the housing shell 1 is dimensioned with<br>
respect to its force-deformation characteristic such<br>
that, given a defined maximum device weight and defined<br>
maximum accelerations, the prestress in the clipped-on<br>
state is sufficient for securely fixing the device.<br>
The separating gap between the two housing<br>
shells 1 in the assembled state leads through the axes<br>
of symmetry of two opposite side walls 7 and 8 and<br>
outside the resilient catch hooks 6.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a perspective view of the<br>
electrical device according to the invention, one<br>
housing shell 1 and a front cover 9, which reaches over<br>
both housing shells 1 in the assembled state, having<br>
been removed. In the housing shell 1 represented there<br>
has been fitted a printed circuit board 10 belonging to<br>
the electrical device, on the edges of which board a<br>
plurality of terminal insulators 11 are mounted. The<br>
terminal insulators 11 are respectively of a 3-pole<br>
form, i.e. they have 3 encapsulated terminal lugs 12.<br>
For assembly, the terminal insulators 11 (see also<br>
FIGURES 3 and 4) are initially clipped into the<br>
printed-circuit board 10 and then soldered. During the<br>
mounting of the printed circuit board 10 in the housing<br>
shells 1, the terminal lugs 12 of the terminal<br>
insulators 11 brought into electrical contact with the<br>
printed circuit board 10 in this way slide in clamping<br>
cages 13, which are only indicated here and have been<br>
inserted into pockets of the housing shells 1 formed in<br>
a corresponding way. The connection lugs 13 of the<br>
terminal insulators 11 neighbouring the resilient catch<br>
hooks 6 protrude laterally out of the housing 2 and can<br>
be used for adding further connection terminals, for<br>
which purpose terminal blocks 15 are clipped on in this<br>
region of the housing 2. In this way, the usually<br>
6-pole devices can be increased to 12 poles.<br>
The housing 2 can be covered on the front side<br>
by a cover 16. Once the cover 16 has been fitted on,<br><br>
the clamping screws (not shown) belonging to the<br>
connection terminals on the housing side are mounted<br>
from outside via screw openings 17 and are secured<br>
against being lost by means of integrated catches 18<br>
(not visible here) in the region of the screw openings<br>
17.<br>
According to FIGURES 3 and 4, the terminal<br>
insulators 11 are symmetrically shaped, which makes it<br>
possible for them to be installed offset by 180° at the<br>
various installation positions on the printed circuit<br>
board 10. Consequently, just one configuration of a<br>
terminal insulator 11 is sufficient to cover all<br>
applications.<br>
On the front side of the electrical device<br>
according to FIGURE 2 there are setting elements, which<br>
can be actuated by means of knobs 19. The knobs 19<br>
have mechanical codings 20, the position of which<br>
changes correspondingly with the angle of rotation of<br>
the respective knob 19. By means of correspondingly<br>
mechanically coded plates 21 which can be clipped onto<br>
the mechanical codings of the knobs 19, according to<br>
FIGURE 5, the knobs 19 can be protected against<br>
unintentional adjustment. On each plate 21 there has<br>
been applied the setting value matching the rotary<br>
position or the matching setting function, in plain<br>
text or in graphic representation. On account of the<br>
mechanical coding between the knob 19 and the plate 21,<br>
a particular plate 21 can be clipped on only if the<br>
knob 19 is in the appropriate position. It is thus<br>
possible by varying the position of the catches 22 to<br>
achieve a coding between a number of variants of the<br>
device. Consequently, the purely functional setting is<br>
realized in a simple and low-cost way by means of knobs<br>
19, with the additional function of an adjusting<br>
securement and visible assignment of a setting value or<br>
function in plain text and graphic representation.<br>
Once the knobs 19 have been set, they may also<br>
be covered, for example by. a transparent injection<br><br>
moulding 23 according to FIGURE 6. The cover 23 can be<br>
lead-sealed by means of a locking part 24, which is<br>
hooked in the housing.<br>
Although the present invention is explained<br>
with reference to the embodiment represented in the<br>
accompanying drawing, it should be taken into<br>
consideration that this is not intended to restrict the<br>
invention only to the embodiment represented but rather<br>
to include all possible changes, modifications and<br>
equivalent arrangements, to the extent that they are<br>
covered by the content of the patent claims.<br><br>
