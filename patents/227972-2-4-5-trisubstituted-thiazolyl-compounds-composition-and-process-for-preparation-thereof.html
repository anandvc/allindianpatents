monocyclic or bicyclic partially saturated heterocycle represents a ring system consisting of 1 or 2 rings and comprising at least one heteroatom selected from O, N or S, and at least one double bond provided that the ring system is not an aromatic system; a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic heterocycle represents an aromatic ring system consisting of 1 or 2 rings and comprising at least one heteroatom selected from O, N or S; the term aromatic is well known to a person skilled in the art and designates cyclically conjugated systems of 4n' + 2 electrons, that is with 6,10,14 etc. n-electrons (rule of Hiickel).<br>
The L or Q radical as described above for the compounds of formula (I) may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (I) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate. For example, when Q is pyridyl, it may be 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl.<br>
Lines drawn into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any suitable ring atom. When the ring system is a bicyclic ring system, the bond may be attached to any suitable ring atom of either of the two rings.<br>
As used herein before, the term (=O) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a carbon atom, a sulfoxide moiety when attached to a sulfur atom and a sulfonyl moiety when two of said terms are attached to a sulfur atom.<br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhaloC1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted C1-6alkyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl. In case more than one halogen atoms are attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhaloC1-6alkyl, they may be the same or different.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter that substituents can be selected each independently out of a list of numerous definitions, such as for example the substituents of L or Q, all possible combinations are intended which are chemically possible and which lead to chemically stable molecules. When ring systems are attached to the remainder of the molecule via a linker, such as for example Het1-NH-,<br>
all possible combinations of ring system and linker are intended which are chemically possible and which lead to chemically stable molecules.<br>
When several consecutive substituents in the radical of formula (c-1) represent a dkect bond, this has to be interpreted as one single direct bond. For instance, when X represents a direct bond, Ci represents CH2, YI, C2, Y2, C3, Y3 and C4 represent a direct bond and Z represents hydrogen, then said radical of formula (c-1) represents methyl (CH3).<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I) and their ./V-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess.

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove or hereinafter are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example,<br>
inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acidj sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example* acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,/7-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, /j-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or arnine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline; the benzathine, ,/V-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.<br>

The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl * p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include for example chloro, bromo, iodo,<br>
trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be made using ion exchange resin columns.<br>
The TV-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called JV-oxide.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>

The compounds of the present invention show cytokine production modulating activity, in particular cytokine production inhibitory activity, more in particular proinflammatory cytokine production inhibitory activity. A cytokine is any secreted polypeptide that affects the function of other cells by modulating interactions between cells in the immune or inflammatory response. Examples of cytokines include Interleukin-1 (IL-1) up to Interleukin-23 (IL-23), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a), Tumor Necrosis Factor-beta (TNF-(3). The present compounds also show inhibitory activity on the production of chemotactic cytokines or chemokines responsible for trafficking and activation of leucocytes. A chemokine production inhibited by the compounds of formula (I) is MCP-1 production (Monocyte Chemotactic Protein 1).<br>
The cytokine production specifically inhibited by the compounds of formula (I) is TNF-a and/or Interleukin-12 (IL-12) production.<br>
TNF-a is primarily produced by monocytes, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, tumour cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, astrocytes, microglial cells, smooth muscle cells and others. This proinflammatory cytokine is established at the pinnacle of proinflammatory cascades; it exerts a key role in the cytokine network with regard to the pathogenesis of many infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Excessive or unregulated TNF-a production is implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, juvenile arthritis and other arthritic conditions, polychondritis, sclerodoma,<br>
Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopatic sprue, endocrine opthalmopathy, Grave's disease, alveolitis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, primary billiary cirrhosis, uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, pemphigus, eosinophilia, Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic infestation, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granuloma, eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, cerebral malaria, adult respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis (acute, arachidic, catarrhal, chronic, croupus, phthinoid bronchitis), chronic obstructive airway or pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumoconiosis (alummosis,anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicocis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tobaccosis, byssionosis), tuberculosis, silicosis, exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity to other drug therapy (e.g. aspirin or p-agonist therapy), pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, meningitis, reperfusion injury, graft versus host reaction, allograft rejections, transplant rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia (consequential to, e.g. bacterial, viral or parasitic, infection or to deprivation or deterioration of humoral or other organic function, or secondary to malignancy; malarial and vermal cachexia; cachexia resulting from dysfunction of the pituitary, thyroid or thymus glands as well as uremic cachexia; cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), diabetes, cancer, angiogenesis, lymphoma, Kawasaki syndrome, Behcet's syndrome, aphthous ulceration, skin-related disorders such as psoriasis, eczema, burns, dermatitis, keloid formation, scar tissue formation, erythema nodosum leprosum, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, pyresis, asthma (intrinsic, extrinsic, allergic, non-atopic, exercise induced and occupational and bacterial infection induced asthma), wheezy infant syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pancreatitis, cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, acute liver failure, glomerulonephritis, therapy-associated syndromes comprising Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, and syndromes associated with IL-2 infusion, anti-CD3 antibody infusion, hemodialysis, yellow fever vaccination. TNF-a has also been shown to activate HIV (Human Immune deficiency Virus) replication in monocytes and/or macrophages. Therefore, inhibition of TNF-a production or activity aids in limiting HIV progression. TNF-a also plays a role in other viral infections, such as Hepatitis C, CMV (cytomegalovirus), influenza and herpes virus infections, including herpes simplex virus type-1, herpes simplex virus type-2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus-6,-7 and -8, pseudorabies and rhinotracheitis.<br>
IL-12 is produced primarily by monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in response to bacteria, bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide) and immune signals. The production of IL-12 is regulated by other cytokines and endogenous mediators produced during inflammatory and immunological responses. IL-12 plays a central role in the immune system. Evidence obtained from animal models and human diseases suggests that inappropriate and protracted production of IL-12 and the ability of IL-12 to induce the generation of T helper 1 cell type responses may be instrumental in the development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, collagen induced arthritis, allergic encephalitis, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, and in the triggering of autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes, or graft versus host diseases, shock or musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases. The adverse effects also include anemia (haemolytic, aplastic, pure red cell, idiopatic thrombocytopenia), neutropenia, lymphopenia, hepatosplenomegaly with mononuclear cell infiltration and pulmonary edema with interstitial cell infiltrates. Excessive IL-12 production may accelerate the inflammatory progress of a disease, or the onset of the disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or it may also augment the disease severity.<br>
Inhibition of TNF-a and/or IL-12 production by the compounds of formula (I) might offer an interesting, potentially less toxic alternative to non-specific immunosuppression (e.g. corticosteroids) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The combined modulation of TNF-a and IL-12 production may ameliorate the treated disease to a greater extent than mono-therapy. The therapeutic effect of combining the suppression of both the immune and the inflammatory arm of a disease may provide additional clinical benefits. The present compounds are also indicated for use as co-therapeutic agents for use in conjunction with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. as potentiators of the therapeutic activity of said drugs, to reduce required dosaging or thus also potential side effects of said drugs. Immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs include for example cyclopeptide, cyclopeptolide or macrolide immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs, such as drugs belonging to the cyclosporin class, e.g. cyclosporine A or G, tacrolimus substances, ascdmycin, rapamycin, glucocorticosteroid drugs, e.g. budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone, mometasone.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are useful in preventing or treating cytokine mediated diseases, and as such, inhibit, suppress or antagonize the production or activity of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and/or IL-12.<br>
Disorders mediated through TNF-a and/or IL-12 refers to any and all disorders and disease states in which TNF-a and/or IL-12 play a role, either by the cytokine itself, or by the cytokine causing another cytokine, such as for example IL-1 or IL-6, or a certain mediator to be released.<br>
Due to their cytokine production inhibitory activity, in particular their proinflammatory cytokine production inhibitory activity, more in particular their TNF-a and/or EL-12 inhibitory activity, even more in particular their IL-12 inhibitory activity, the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions mediated through cytokines, in particular diseases or conditions related to excessive or unregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and/or IL-12, comprising inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases. Diseases or conditions related to an excessive or unregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines comprise rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, juvenile arthritis and other arthritic conditions, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopatic sprue, endocrine opthalmopathy, Graves' disease, alveolitis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, primary billiary cirrhosis, uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis* pemphigus, eosinophilia, Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic infestation, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granuloma, eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, cerebral malaria, adult respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis (acute, arachidic, catarrhal, chronic, croupus, phthinoid bronchitis), chronic obstructive airway or pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis (aluminosis,anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicocis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tobaccosis, byssionosis), exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity to other drug therapy (e.g. aspirin or p-agonist therapy), silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, meningitis, allergic encephalitis, reperfusion injury, graft versus host reaction, allograft rejections, transplant rejections, musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza,<br>

In particular, the compounds of formula (I) can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel disease, colitis, psoriasis or multiple sclerosis.<br>
The cytokine production inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula (I) such as the inhibition of TNF-a and/or IL-12 production, may be demonstrated in the in vitro test "Inhibition of cytokine production in human whole blood cultures". Suitable in vivo tests are "Determination of cytokine in serum of LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and anti-CD3 challenged mice", "Inhibition of LPS-galactosamine induced shock in mice", "Inhibition of collagen induced arthritis in mice".<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also inhibit Interleukin-6 (IL-6).<br>
The present compounds may also act as intermediates for the preparation of further thiazolyl derivatives.<br>
In view of the above described pharmacological properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts,<br>
quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms, may be used as a medicine. In particular, the present compounds can be used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing diseases mediated through cytokines, more in particular diseases mediated through TNF-oc and/or IL-12, such as inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from or a method of preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from diseases mediated through cytokines, in particular mediated through TNF-a and/or IL-12, such as inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Said methods comprise the administration, preferably oral administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a A/-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions for preventing or treating diseases mediated through cytokines, in particular TNF-a and/or IL-12 comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
To aid solubility of the compounds of formula (I), suitable ingredients, e.g. cyclodextrins, may be included hi the compositions. Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, p-, y-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with C1_6alkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated p-CD; hydroxyC1-6alkyl, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyC1-6alkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; C1-6alkylcarbonyl, particularly acetyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are p-CD, randomly methylated p-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-y-CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-y-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-p-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-p-CD (2-HP-p-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (M.51.) is used as a measure of the average number of moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The average substitution degree (D.S.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit. The M.S. and D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Depending on the technique used, slightly different values may be obtained for one given cyclodextrin derivative. Preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the M.51. ranges from 0.125 to 10 and the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Other suitable compositions for oral or rectal administration comprise particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising a compound of formula (I) and one or more appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" used hereinafter defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, in casu the compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components (in case additional pharmaceutically acceptable formulating agents, generally known in the art, are included, such as plasticizers, preservatives and the like). When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermo-dynamics, such a solid dispersion will be called "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered. This advantage can probably be explained by the ease with which said solid solutions can form liquid solutions when contacted with a liquid medium such as the gastro-intestinal juices. The ease of dissolution may be attributed at least in part to the fact that the energy required for dissolution of the components from a solid solution is less than that required for the dissolution of components from a crystalline or microcrystalline solid phase.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase. For example, the term "a solid<br>
dispersion" also relates to a system having domains or small regions wherein amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline compound of formula (I), or amorphous, macrocrystalline or crystalline water-soluble polymer, or both, are dispersed more or less evenly in another phase comprising water-soluble polymer, or compound of . formula (I), or a solid solution comprising compound of formula (I) and water-soluble polymer. Said domains are regions within the solid dispersion distinctively marked by some physical feature, small in size, and evenly and randomly distributed throughout the solid dispersion.<br>
Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation.<br>
The solution-evaporation process comprises the following steps :<br>
a) dissolving the compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer in an appropriate solvent, optionally at elevated temperatures;<br>
b) heating the solution resulting under point a), optionally under vacuum, until the solvent is evaporated. The solution may also be poured onto a large surface so as to form a thin film, and evaporating the solvent therefrom.<br>
hi the spray-drying technique, the two components are also dissolved in an appropriate solvent and the resulting solution is then sprayed through the nozzle of a spray dryer followed by evaporating the solvent from the resulting droplets at elevated temperatures.<br>
The preferred technique for preparing solid dispersions is the melt-extrusion process comprising the following steps :<br>
a)   mixing a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer,<br>
b)  optionally blending additives with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c)   heating and compounding the thus obtained blend until one obtains a homogenous melt,<br>
d)  forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e)   cooling the melt till it solidifies.<br>
The terms "melt" and "melting" should be interpreted broadly. These terms not only mean the alteration from a solid state to a liquid state, but can also refer to a transition to a glassy state or a rubbery state, and in which it is possible for one component of-the mixture to get embedded more or less homogeneously into the other. In particular<br>
cases, one component will melt and the other component(s) will dissolve in the melt thus forming a solution, which upon cooling may form a solid solution having advantageous dissolution properties.<br>
After preparing the solid dispersions as described hereinabove, the obtained products can be optionally milled and sieved.<br>
The solid dispersion product may be milled or ground to particles having a particle size of less than 600 urn, preferably less than 400 um and most preferably less than 125 um.<br>
The particles prepared as described hereinabove can then be formulated by conventional techniques into pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.<br>
It will be appreciated that a person of skill in the art will be able to optimize the parameters of the solid dispersion preparation techniques described above, such as the most appropriate solvent, the working temperature, the kind of apparatus being used, the rate of spray-drying, the throughput rate in the melt-extruder<br>
The water-soluble polymers in the particles are polymers that have an apparent viscosity, when dissolved at 20°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000 mPa.s more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For example, suitable water-soluble polymers include alkylcelluloses, hydroxyalkyl-celluloses, hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcelluloses, alkali metal salts of carboxyalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters, starches, pectines, chitin derivates, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides such as trehalose, alginic acid or alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans, tragacanth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gurnmi and xanthan gummi, polyacrylic acids and the salts thereof, polymethacrylic acids and the salts thereof, methacrylate copolymers, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone with vinyl acetate, combinations of polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses.<br>
Also one or more cyclodextrins can be used as water soluble polymer in the preparation of the above-mentioned particles as is disclosed in WO 97/18839. Said cyclodextrins include the pharmaceutically acceptable unsubstituted and substituted cyclodextrins<br>
known in the art, more particularly a, p or y cyclodextrins or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Substituted cyclodextrins which can be used to prepare the above described particles include polyethers described in U.S. Patent 3,459,731. Further substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by C1-6alkyl, hydroxyC1-6alkyl, carboxy-C1_6alkyl or C1-6alkyloxycarbonylCl-6alkyl or mixed ethers thereof. In particular such substituted<br>
cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by C1-3alkyl, hydroxyC2-4alkyl or carboxyC1-6alkyl or more in<br>
particular by methyl, ethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl, carboxy-methyl or carboxyethyl.<br>
Of particular utility are the p-cyclodextrin ethers, e.g. dimethyl-p-cyclodextrin as described in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 577-578 by M. Nogradi (1984) and polyethers, e.g. hydroxypropyl p-cyclodextrin and hydroxyethyl P-cyclodextrin, being examples. Such an alkyl ether may be a methyl ether with a degree of substitution of about 0.125 to 3, e.g. about 0.3 to 2. Such a hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin may for example be formed from the reaction between p-cyclodextrin an propylene oxide and may have a MS value of about 0.125 to 10, e.g. about 0.3 to 3.<br>
Another type of substituted cyclodextrins is sulfobutylcyclodextrines.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula (I) over the water soluble polymer may vary widely. For example ratios of 1/100 to 100/1 may be applied. Interesting ratios of the compound of formula (I) over cyclodextrin range from about 1/10 to 10/1. More interesting ratios range from about 1/5 to 5/1.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds of formula (I) in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the compound of formula (I) but do not chemically bond to said compound.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular<br>
weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds of formula (I) involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds of formula (I) are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise a central, rounded or spherical core, a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and a compound of formula (I) and optionally a seal-coating layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.
