The invention concerns a process for the production of water-soluble, naturally folded and secreted polypeptides after expression in prokaryotic cells.<br>
Protein synthesis in prokaryotic organisms, which is also called translation, takes place on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. When recombinant DNA is expressed in prokaryotic host organisms, it is often desirable to secrete the recombinant gene product or protein that is obtained in this process from the cytoplasm through the inner bacterial membrane into the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membrane. Secreted proteins can then be released from the periplasm into the nutrient medium for example by osmotic shock. A disadvantage of this process is that the secreted polypeptides often do not form the native, biologically active conformation (Hockhey, TIBTECH 12 (1994) 456 - 463; Baynex, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 10 (1999) 411-421).<br>
Recently molecular chaperones and folding catalysts such as peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases or protein disulfide isomerases (Glockshuber et al., EP-A 0 510 658) have been used to increase the yield of native recombinant protein when folded in vivo (Thomas et al., Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 66 (1997) 197-238). In some cases this has led to considerable improvements in the expression e.g. of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RUBISCO; Goloubinoff et al., Nature 337 (1989) 44-47), human procollagenase (Lee &amp; Olins, J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 2849-2852) or neuronal nitrogen oxide synthase from rats (Roman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci- USA 92 (1995) 8428-8432). In these examples GroEL/ES or the DnaK system from E. coli was co-overexpressed in the cytosol. The positive effect is usually an increased yield of the desired protein in a soluble form.<br>
The co-expression of chaperones has also been examined when recombinant proteins are secreted into the periplasm of E. coli. However, in this case only a cytosolic overexpression of chaperones was evaluated in order to optimize secretion into the periplasm (Perez-Perez et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 210 (1995) 524-529; Sato et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 202 (1994) 258-264; Berges et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62 (1996) 55-60). Previous attempts at cosecretion in E. coli have only concerned folding catalysts such as e.g. protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; Glockshuber et al., EP-A 0 510 658) or peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases or Dsb proteins from E.coli (Knappik et al., Bio/Technology 11 (1993) 77-83; Qiu et al., Appl. Environm. Microbiol. 64 (1998) 4891-4896 and Schmidt et al, Prot. Engin. 11 (1998) 601 - 607). Recently, co-overexpression of the periplasmic Skp protein led to more efficient folding of phase display and higher yield of antibody<br><br>
fragments secreted to the periplasm (Bothman and Pluckthun, Nat. Biotechnol. 16 (1998) 376-380; Hayhurst and Harris, Prot. Expr. Purif. 15 (1999) 336-343).<br>
Compounds such as urea or urea derivatives, formamide, acetamide or L-arginine are used in methods for the in vitro renaturation of insoluble protein aggregates (inclusion bodies) which are formed during the cytoplasmic expression of recombinant DNA in prokaryotic cells. L-arginine as an additive can considerably improve the yield of natively folded proteins in the renaturation in vitro (Rudolph et al., US-Patent No. 5,593,865; Buchner &amp; Rudolph, Bio/Technology 9 (1991)157-162; Brinkmann et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 89 (1992) 3075-3079; Lin &amp; Traugh, Prot. Express. Purif. 4 (1993) 256-264).<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of water-soluble, naturally folded eukaryotic polypeptides after expression in prokaryotes which can be carried out in a simple manner and which does not require a laborious in vitro after-treatment such as solubilization, reduction and renaturation of inclusion bodies, reduction and renaturation.<br>
The object is achieved by a process for the production of a water-soluble, naturally folded eukaryotic polypeptide containing two or several cysteines linked by disulfide bridges, by culturing prokaryotic cells,<br>
a)	in which the said prokaryotic cells contain an expression vector which encodes the said polypeptide which contains a prokaryotic signal sequence at the N-terminus,<br>
b)	under conditions under which the polypeptide is secreted into the periplasm or the medium,<br>
c)	cleaving the signal sequence and isolating the polypeptide from the periplasm or the medium<br>
wherein the culture is carried out in the presence of arginine or a compound of the general formula I<br>
R2-CO-NRR1 (I)<br>
in which<br><br>
R and R1 represent hydrogen or a saturated or unsaturated branched or unbranched C1 -C4 alkyl chain and<br>
R2 represents hydrogen, NHR1 or a saturated or unsaturated branched or unbranched C1 -C3 alkyl chain.<br>
The concentration of arginine or of the compound of the general formula I is preferably at least 0.1 mol/1, but can also be considerably higher provided the solubility of arginine or the said compound is ensured. Arginine or the compounds of the general formula I are preferably used at a concentration of 0.1 to 1.5 mol/1.<br>
Formamide, acetamide, urea or urea derivatives such as ethylurea or methylurea are preferably added as compounds of the general formula I, to the nutrient medium that is used to culture the prokaryotic cells. Arginine can for example be used as the hydrochloride or as another titrated form of the arginine base. However, L-arginine is preferably used and the hydrochloride form of L-arginine is particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, reducing thiol reagents which contain SH groups are additionally added to the nutrient medium (fermentation medium) used to culture the prokaryotic cells which further increases the yield of recombinantly produced protein. 0.1 - 15 mmol/1 thiol reagent is preferably added. According to the invention the term "thiol reagent" either means a reducing (reduced) reagent with SH groups or a mixture of reducing reagents with SH groups and oxidizing reagents with disulfide groups. Preferred substances are reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH), cysteine, cystine, N-acetylcysteine, cysteamine, β-mercaptoethanol and similar compounds. The thiol reagents can be used singly as well as in mixtures. Thiol reagents such as glutathione (GSH) which have a single SH group per molecule are particularly suitable. Thiol reagents such as glutathione are known to improve the yield of natively folded proteins when recombinant DNA is expressed in prokaryotic cells (Glockshuber et al.,EP-A 0 510 658).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention molecular chaperones are additionally overexpressed and cosecreted. Chaperones are understood according to the invention as proteins which protect other non-native proteins from aggregation in vivo and promote the formation of their native conformation. Molecular chaperones are used in the prior art to stabilize proteins and thus to protect them from aggregation and inactivation  (Buchner et al., EP-A 0  556 726 Al).  Preferably ATP-<br><br>
dependent chaperones of the HSP40 type (molar mass ca. 40 kDa) or a small heat shock protein (sHSP) are preferably used. DnaJ is a 40 kDa heat shock protein which occurs in the cytoplasm of E. coli and is a part of the so-called Hsp70 chaperone system (Bukau, B. &amp; Horwich, A., Cell 92 (1998) 351-366). DnaK (Hsp70) and GrpE also belong to this system. Particular proteins are folded into the native conformation by the DnaK system in an ATP-dependent process (Schroder et al, EMBO J. 12 (1993) 4137-4144; Langer et al, Nature 356 (1992) 683 - 689). DnaJ protects non-native proteins from aggregation in the absence of DnaK and ATP and mediates a folding-competent state (Schroder et al., EMBO J. 12 (1993) 4137-4144). It has been shown that the co-expression of Dna) in the cytosol can lead to an increase in the yield of soluble protein (Yokoyama et al., Microbiol. Ferment. Technol. 62 (1998) 1205-1210). The co-secretion of an N-terminal fragment of DnaJ which comprises the amino acids 1-108 and in the following is referred to as the J domain (Kelley, TIBS 23 (1998) 222-227) is additionally preferred. The J domains and a G/F-rich domain which are responsible for interactions with DnaK are located in this region (Wall et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270 (1995) 2139-2144).<br>
Hsp25 (e.g. from the mouse) is a representative of the small heat shock proteins (Gaestel et al., Eur. J. Biochem, 179 (1989) 209-213) which are a ubiquitous class of chaperones. The molar mass of these proteins is between 15 and 30 kDa. During heat shock there is a substantial accumulation of sHsps in the cell (up to 1% of the total cell protein - Arrigo &amp; Landry (1994), In Morimoto (Hrsg.): The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbour Press, 335-373). Like DnaJ proteins, sHsps have the property of preventing the aggregation of non-native proteins and of keeping these in a folding-competent state (Jakob et al, J. Biol. Chem. 268 (1993) 1517-1520; Ehrsperger et al, EMBO J. 16 (1997) 221-229).<br>
The term „overexpression" according to the present invention means an increase of the expression of secreted proteins such as e.g. DnaJ and Hsp25 (preferably by at least 100 %) compared to expression in the wild-type of the respective prokaryotic host organism. Such an overexpression can for example be achieved when the genes (for the protein, chaperone and/or signal peptide) are under the control of a strong prokaryotic, preferably inducible, expression signal (e.g. of a lac or T7 promoter or a derivative thereof).<br>
The secretion construct for the overexpression of polypeptides (proteins) including regulatory regions (promoter and terminator) on the recombinant DNA is preferably integrated into a vector which additionally encodes the arginine-tRNA AGA/AGG which is rare  in  prokaryotes  or  it  is  co-expressed with  a  vector which  encodes  this tRNA<br><br>
(Brinkmann et al., Gene 85 (1989) 109-114). This enables the co-overexpression of the respective proteins into the bacterial periplasm as well as the trancription of the rare tRNAArg AGA/AGG, which often results in an increased synthesis of the desired protein in the bacterial host organism.<br>
A prokaryotic signal sequence in the sense of the invention is understood as a nucleic acid fragment which is derived from prokaryotes, preferably from gram-negative bacteria, and ensures that proteins bound to the signal peptide can penetrate through the inner bacterial membranes. As a result the proteins are located in the periplasm or in the cell supernatant. Such signal sequences usually have a length of 18 - 30 amino acids and are described for example in Murphy &amp; Beckwith: Export of Proteins to the Cell Envelope in Escherichia coli in Neidhardt et al. (editors): Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Second Edition, Vol. 1, ASM Press, Washington, 1996, p. 967-978. The cleavage of bacterial signal sequences can for example occur after an Ala-X-Ala sequence (von Heijne et al., J. Mol. Biol. 184 (1985) 99-105). The structure of the bacterial signal peptidase is described in Paetzel et al.. Nature 396 (1998) 186-190. Signal sequences are preferably used that are cleaved again from the desired protein by proteases located in the periplasm of prokaryotic cells. Alternatively such proteases can be added to the cell supernatant or to the isolated protein to cleave the signal sequence.<br>
The process according to the invention can improve the heterologous expression of numerous eukaryotic proteins such as e.g. proteases, interferons, protein hormones, antibodies or fragments thereof. The process is particularly suitable for the heterologous production of proteins which contain at least two cysteines linked by a disulfide bridge in their native state, especially when they have no prokaryotic signal sequence fused at the N-terminus and insoluble inclusion bodies are formed during their prokaryotic expression. The process is particularly suitable for proteins which contain more than 5 disulfide bridges in the native state. Such a protein is for example a recombinant plasminogen activator (referred to as rPA in the following, Martin et al., Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 11 (1993) 299-311, US-Patent Nr. 5,223,256). rPA has 9 disulfide bridges which are not formed in the reducing cytosol of E. coli.<br>
The periplasmic location of the protein and optionally of the chaperone is ensured by operative linkage with a signal peptide to penetrate the inner bacterial membranes.<br>
A concentration of 0.4 mol/1 L-arginine and 5 mmol/1 glutathione (in the case of co-secretion of DnaJ, J domain, Hsp25 and scFv) or 0.4 mol/1 L-arginine without glutathione<br><br>
(without co-secretion of DnaJ) has proven to be optimal for the expression of such a plasminogen activator.<br>
In order to isolate the secretory rPA protein in a functional form in E coli, the gene for this protein from the plasmid pA27fd7 (Kohnert et al, Protein Engineering 5 (1992) 93-100) was fused by genetic engineering methods to a prokaryotic signal sequence of gram-negative bacteria, for example to the signal sequence of pectate lyase B (PelB) from Erwinia carotovora. The gene fusion was constructed by cloning into the vector pET20b(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, USA). As a result the gene expression is under the control of the T7 promoter. The signal sequence present in the fusion protein mediates the secretion into the periplasm. The signal sequence is cleaved during or after the secretion by a peptidase located at the inner membrane. The secreted protein can then fold in the periplasm. The oxidizing conditions in this compartment enable the formation of disulfide bridges (Wuelting and Pliickthun, Mol. Microbiol. 12 (1994) 685-692). The inventive addition of low molecular weight additives that improve folding and thiol reagents in the nutrient medium and the simultaneous co-overexpression of DnaJ, J-domain or Hsp25 in the periplasm enables the yield of functional protein to be increased by more than 100-fold.<br>
Other examples of polypeptides according to the invention are antibodies or antibody fragments such as single-chain Fy-fragment (scFv, e.g against thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH). ScFyS are shortened antibodies which are only composed of the variable sections (Fv) of the heavy and light chain of an antibody which are artificially fused via a short peptide linker (usually Gly4Ser3) (Hudson, Curr. Opin Biotechnol. 9 (1998) 395-402). ScFys normally have the same affinity for the antigen as the paternal Fy-strands, but can be overexpressed in E coli. Since they have stabilizing intradomain disulfide bridges which are essential for stability, an expression in the cytosol usually leads to the formation of inclusion bodies (Shibui et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 37 (1992) 352-357). ScFys can be specifically optimized for binding the desired antigens by random mutations and subsequent phage display selection (Allen et al, TIBS 20 (1995) 511-516; Hoogenboom et al, Immunotechnology 4 (1998) 1-20). Addition of 5 mM GSH and 0.4 M L-arginine enables the yield of functional ScFy-TSH to be improved 7-fold in the periplasm and by 43-fold in the medium supernatant compared to a culture without additives.<br>
The following examples, publications, the sequence protocol and the figures further elucidate the invention, the protective scope of which results from the patent claims. The described methods are to be understood as examples which still describe the subject matter of the invention even after modifications.<br><br>

General:<br>
For the periplasmic overexpression of DnaJ, the J-domain and Hsp25 in E. coli, the DNA which encodes these proteins was fused by genetic engineering to the signal sequence of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli and the fusion was expressed in E. coli on a recombinant plasmid under the control of the lac-lpp promoter. As a result the polypeptide chains of DnaJ and Hsp25 are transported into the periplasm of the prokaryotic host organism and are natively folded there. Their location and native folding was demonstrated by limited proteolysis with trypsin and by Western blot.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pIN III omp A3-dnaJ<br>
Molecular genetic techniques were based on Ausubel et al. (ed.), J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997, Curr. Protocols of Molecular Biology. Oligonucleotides were obtained from the companies      MWG Biotech, Ebersberg or GIBCO Life Sciences, Eggenstein, DE.<br>
The gene which encodes DnaJ, Gene Bank Accession No. M 12565, was amplified by PCR and cloned by means of the thereby generated restriction cleavage sites EcoRI and BamHI into the expression plasmid pIN III ompA3 (Ghayreb et al, EMBO J. 3 (1984) 2437-2442. The sequence of the cloned PCR fragment was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (LiCor DNA-Sequencer 4000, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg). The resulting plasmid was named pIN III ompA3-dnaJ. The sequence of DnaJ expressed in the periplasm differs from that of the wild-type protein in that the polypeptide sequence begins with Gly-Ile-Pro instead of Met, hence there was an N-terminal extension of 2 amino acids. Hence DnaJ is under the control of the lac-lpp promoter which is induced with IPTG (isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactoside).<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pUBS520-pIN-dnaJ<br>
The region from the plasmid pIN III ompA3-dnaJ which encodes the lac-lpp operon, the signal sequence, the dnaj gene and the terminator region of the operon was amplified by means of PCR (SEQ ID NO: 1). The PCR product was cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Bglll and cloned into the vector pUBS520 linearized with the restriction endonuclease BamHL The resulting plasmid was named pUBS520-pIN-dnaJ (Fig. 3).<br>
Example 3:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pUBS 520-pIN-J-Domain<br>
Two stop codons were inserted in the plasmid pUBS 520-pIN-dnaJ after the nucleotide 324 by means of the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Promega, Mannheim, DE) so that only the first 108 amino acids are expressed. The sequence of the mutagenized region was determined by dideoxy sequencing (LiCor DNA-Sequencer 4000, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg) and the expression of the shortened protein fragment was detected by Western blotting and detection with an anti-DnaJ antibody. The plasmid that was formed was named pUBS 520-pIN-I-domain (Fig. 4).<br>
Example 4:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pIN III ompA3-hsp25<br>
The gene which encodes Hsp25, Gene Bank Accession No.: L 07577, was amplified by PCR and cloned by means of the thereby generated restriction cleavage sites EcoRI and BamHI into the expression plasmid pIN III ompA3 (Ghayreb et al, EMBO J. 3 (1984) 2437-2442). The sequence of the cloned PCR fragment was checked by dideoxy sequencing (LiCor DNA-Sequencer 4000, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg). The resulting plasmid was named pIN III ompA3-hsp25. The sequence of the Hsp25 expressed in the periplasm differs from that of the wild-type protein in that the polypeptide sequence begins with Gly-Ile-Leu instead of Met, hence there was an N-terminal extension of 2 amino acids. Hence Hsp25 is under the control of the lac-lpp promoter which is induced with IPTG (isopropyl-P-D-thiogalactoside).<br><br>
Example 5:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pUBS520-pIN-hsp25<br>
The region from the plasmid pIN III ompA3-hsp25 which encodes the lac-lpp operon, the signal sequence, the hsp25 gene and the terminator region of the operon was amplified by means of PCR (SEQ ID NO: 5). The PCR product was cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Bglll and cloned into the vector pUBS520 linearized with the restriction endonuclease BamHL The resulting plasmid was named pUBS520-pIN-hsp25 (Fig. 5).<br>
Example 6:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pUBS520-scFvOx<br>
The co-expression of a single chain Fv fragment which is directed against the hapten oxazolon (scFvOxazolon; Fiedler and Conrad, Bio/Technology 13 (1995) 1090-1093) which has no chaperone properties was examined as a negative control.<br>
The region from the plasmid pHEN-scFvOx which encodes the lac promoter, the signal sequence pelB and the scfvox gene was amplified by means of PCR. The region from the plasmid pIN III ompA3 which encodes the Ipp termintor was amplified in a second PCR. The two fragments were fused in a subsequent PCR. The PCR product (SEQ ID NO: 7) that was formed in this manner was cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Bglll and cloned into the vector pUBS520 that was linearized with the restriction endonuclease BamHI. The resulting plasmid was named pUBS520-scFvOx (Fig. 6).<br>
Example 7:<br>
Construction of the expression plasmid pET20b(+)-rPA<br>
The gene of a plasminogen activator (rPA) from the plasmid vector pA27fd7 (Kohnert et al., Protein Engineering 5 (1992) 93-100) was amplified with the aid of a PCR method. The PCR product was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases Ncol and BamHI and cloned into the plasmid vector pET20b(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, USA). The plasmid encodes a fusion protein which is composed of the signal sequence of PelB (pectate lyase from Erwinia carotovora) and rPA and the secretion of rPA into the periplasm was checked by dideoxy sequencing (LiCor DNA-Sequencer 4000, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, DE). The construct was named pET20b(+)-rPA (Fig. 7). rPA is expressed from the plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter, the T7-RNA-polymerase in the strain E. coli BL21(DE3) being linder the control of the lacUV5 Dromoter. The induction was carried out by adding IPTG.<br><br>
The rPA expressed in the periplasm differs from the plasminogen activator described by Kohnert et al. in that the second amino acid (Ser) is substituted by Ala.<br>
Example 8:<br>
Functional expression of rPA in the periplasm of E. coli using the medium additives<br>
glutathione and L-arginine<br>
A stationary overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Studier &amp; Moffat, J. Mol. Biol. 189 (1986) 113-130) which had been transformed with pET20b(+)-rPA and pUBS520-pIN-dnaj (co-secretion of DnaJ), an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(+)-rPA and pUBS520-pIN-J-domain (co-secretion of the J-domain), an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(+)-rPA and pUBS520-pIN-hsp25 (co-secretion of Hsp25), an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(+)-rPA and pUBS520-scFvOx (co-secretion of scFvOx), an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(-h)-rPA and pUBS520 or an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(+) and pUBS520 (control culture), was diluted in a ratio of 1:50 in 100 ml LB-Medium containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and kanamycin (50 |ig/ml, Fluka Chemica, Neu-Ulm, DE) and shaken at 24°C and 170 rpm. After 3 h growth, 5 ml aliquots of the culture were added to 10 ml LB medium containing the aforementioned amounts of ampicillin and kanamycin and various concentrations of GSH (0-10 mM, Fluka, DE) and L-arginine HCl (0-0,4 M, ICN) and each was induced with ImM IPTG (isopropyl-|3-D-thiogalactoside, AppliChem, Darmstadt, DE). The cells were shaken for a further 21 h at 24°C and 170 rpm and a 1 ml sample was taken after determining the OD6oo- These 1 ml cell samples were fractionated in 2 ml Eppendorf reaction vessels by a modified protocol according to Jacobi et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 21692-21699). In detail 500 µl fractionation buffer (150 mM NaCl (Roth GmbH), 50 mM Tris/HCl (Roth GmbH), 5 mM EDTA (Biomol) and 1 mg/ml polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma), pH 7.5) was added to the cell pellet, shaken for 1 h at 10 °C on an Eppendorf thermoshaker at 1400 rpm and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14 000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge cooled to 10°C to form a fraction containing the soluble periplasmic proteins (supernatant) and a residual fraction (pellet).<br>
The activity of rPA was determined according to the method of Verheijen et al. Thromb. Haemostasis 48 (1982) 266-269).<br><br>
All determined rPA concentrations in the cell extracts were standardized to cell suspensions of OD600-l in order to correct the error that occurs when measuring in different buffers.<br>
Example 9:<br>
Functional expression of rPA in the periplasm of E. coli   using mixtures of glutathione<br>
with formamide, methylformamide, acetamide, methylurea and ethylurea as medium<br>
additives<br>
A stationary overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which had been transformed with pET20b(+)-rPA and pUBS520-pIN-dnaJ (co-secretion of DnaJ) were cultured as stated in example 8. Compounds of formula I and in each case 5 mM glutathione were additionally added to the culture medium. A control culture was cultured in LB without additives. The compounds of formula I and the concentrations used are listed in table 3. The sample preparation, periplasm fractionation and the enzyme test for tPA activity were carried out as stated in example 8.<br><br><br><br>
Example 10:<br>
Expression of a functional single chain Fv fragment with addition of reduced glutathione<br>
and L-arginine to the culture medium<br>
A stationary overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) which has been transformed with a plasmid which encodes a single chain Fv fragment of an anti-TSH antibody (US-Patent No. 5,614,367) and pUBS520 (Brinkmann et al, Gene 85 (1989) 109-114) was diluted in a ratio of 1:50 in 100 ml LB-Medium containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and kanamycin (50 µg/ml, Fluka Chemica, Neu-Ulm, DE) and shaken at 24°C and 170 rpm. After 3 h growth, 5 ml aliquots of the culture were added to 10 ml LB medium containing the aforementioned amounts of ampicillin and kanamycin and various concentrations of GSH (0-10 mM, Fluka) and L-arginine HCl (0-0,4 M, ICN) and each was induced with ImM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside, AppliChem, Darmstadt). The cells were shaken for a further 21 h at 24 °C and 170 rpm and a 1 ml sample was taken after determining the OD600- These 1 ml cell samples were fractionated in 2 ml Eppendorf reaction vessels by a modified protocol according to Jacobi et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 21692-21699) (see example 8). In addition a sample of the medium supernatant (1 ml) was taken. The samples were subjected to an ELISA test to analyse them for functional antibodies.<br><br>
Binding of native scFv-TSH to TSH was standardized with scFv-TSH Standard, purified with the RPAS-system (Pharmacia Biotech, Germany) (one unit corresponds to the binding of 1 |il standard to the microtiter plate coated with TSH). The addition of L-arginine to the culture medium also had a positive effect on the yield of native scFv-TSH in the periplasm and in the medium supernatant of E. coli. The addition of 0.4 M L-arginine and 5 mM GSH enabled the amount of antibody fragment that was detected by means of ELISA to be increased by 7-fold in the medium supernatant and by 43-fold in the periplasmic fraction compared to a culture with 5 mM GSH (Fig. 8).<br><br>
