				<td>STRAIGHTENING BENCH OF THE CAR BODY<br>
The present invention relates to a straightening bench of the car body, which<br>
comprises a straightening tower attached to a straightening table of a car body, a<br>
pulling element for a straightening pull, which pulling element is possible to be<br>
attached to the straightening tower as well as to the car body for a straightening pull<br>
of the car, and a transfer device attached to the straightening tower for moving the<br>
pulling element.<br>
In crash repairs of cars for straightening of their bodies and other parts various<br>
straightening apparatus are used. In these apparatus, there are straightening tables<br>
or similar, and fastening devices in them, with which a car is attached on a<br>
straightening table as well as pulling devices, with which constructions of a car are<br>
straightened by pulling.<br>
Constructions of a car are made of materials, such as special steels, with the use of<br>
which a firm and strong construction is achieved. The fact that these materials need<br>
strong straightening forces must be taken into account while repairing and<br>
straightening cars. As the materials used today are stronger by their characteristics<br>
than earlier materials, stronger forces are needed in straightening work now. Strong<br>
straightening forces influence the point to be straightened during straightening work<br>
and one must look after that these straightening forces are directed or may influence<br>
only the damaged area and do not have changing influence on undamaged areas. In<br>
case this is not taken into account, undesired changes may be caused to other,<br>
undamaged areas of a car while straightening a damaged area. In addition, it must<br>
be looked after that the forces needed for straightening are not directed to attaching<br>
parts of a car body and they do not damage them. In present devices these facts are<br>
not usually taken into account. The object of the invention is to provide a straightening bench with the use of which<br>
it is possible to take into account the earlier mentioned disadvantages. Especially,<br>
the object of the invention is to provide a straightening bench with the use of which<br>
it is possible, with the same device, to carry out a traditional straightening pull,<br>
separate pushing movement and combined pull/push straightening movement, hi<br>
addition, the object of the invention is to provide a straightening bench, which is<br>
easy to use.<br>
The object of the invention is accomplished by a straightening bench, the<br>
characteristics of which are presented in the claims.<br>
The straiglltening bench in accordance with the invention comprises an outer tower<br>
to be connected to a straightening table, an inner tower to be detachably attached to<br>
it, and to be moved in regard to it, to which inner tower the straightening tower has<br>
been attached, and a slide connected to a transfer device and placed to the inner<br>
tower and which is to be moved in regard to it, to which slide a pulling element has<br>
been attached and which slide has been arranged to move the pulling element and<br>
which slide is possible to be attached to the inner tower in order to move it and the<br>
straightening tower in regard to the outer tower. With this land of a straightening<br>
bench, an efficient pulling movement is created, hi addition, in the straightening<br>
bench it is possible to move the straightening tower and devices attached to it in<br>
desired way in regard to the car.<br>
In an advantageous application of the invention the device comprises a supporting<br>
arm to be attached to a straiglltening tower, which supporting arm may be moved<br>
against a car body for keeping the point of the car in place during the straightening<br>
pull. The supporting arm may be placed to the desired point of the car construction<br>
to support it and in that way the point or points hi question may be supported during<br>
the straightening pull. By means of the pushing rod that area of the car body or<br>
frame of the car, which must not move from its location during the straiglltening<br>
pull itself, may be kept in place and supported. In this case the pulling stress can be<br>
directed and it may be directed as strong and exact to those parts and areas, which<br>
are straightened, but the pull does not influence other areas and they are not<br>
damaged. Therefore., the bigger straightening forces that are needed in case of new<br>
body models are not directed or have no influence on undamaged areas of a car but<br>
they influence only the damaged area. This causes also the benefit that a damage<br>
may be easier repaired.<br>
In an advantageous additional application of the invention an inner tower reaches at<br>
least partly inside the outer tower and may be moved along its vertical direction. In<br>
this case the inner tower leans partly on the outer tower and the inner tower is easy<br>
to be move. In addition, the construction is simple and reliable in use.<br>
In the next advantageous additional application of the invention the transfer device<br>
is a double-acting hydraulic cylinder, which has been attached to a slide and to an<br>
outer tower. The double-acting hydraulic cylinder is easy to use and with it a<br>
motion to both direction is reliably achieved.<br>
In the next additional application of the invention the device comprises a locking<br>
device for attaching the slide detachably to the inner tower. By means of a separate<br>
locking device it is possible to attach and to detach the slide easily to the inner<br>
tower.<br>
Next, the invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which,<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an application of a straightening table of a car body and a<br>
straightening bench in accordance with the invention viewed from side,<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a straightening bench of a car body in accordance with figure 1<br>
viewed from side,<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a cross-section of a part of the straightening bench in accordance<br>
with figure 2,<br>
Figure 4 illustrates some parts of the straightening bench presented separately, and<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the use of a straightening bench in accordance with the invention<br>
schematically and viewed from above.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a straightening table 1 of a car body, on which bench a car is<br>
attached for straightening. The figure illustrates the straightening table lifted to the<br>
working position, even though the car is not presented. In addition, the figure<br>
illustrates the straightening bench 2, 3, 4, 5 attached to a straightening table such<br>
that it may be turned and adjusted to various positions in a recognized way.<br>
Figures 2-4 illustrate in more detail the construction of the straightening bench in<br>
accordance with the invention. It comprises an outer tower 6, an inner tower 7, a<br>
straightening tower 2, 3, a slide 8, a transfer device 5, a pulling element 4 and a<br>
supporting arm 9. The outer tower has been connected in accordance with figure 1<br>
to the straightening table such that it may be turned by means of a recognized<br>
turning device. The inner tower has been attached detachable to the outer tower,<br>
which inner tower reaches partly inside the outer tower and has been arranged to be<br>
moved along its longitudinal direction. The straightening tower has been attached to<br>
the inner tower and the straightening tower comprises a vertical tower 2, and to the<br>
head of it, the upper tower 3 has been attached such that it may be turned.<br>
The slide 8 included in the bench and presented in figures 3 and 4 has been placed<br>
at least partly inside the inner tower and it is movable along the longitudinal<br>
direction of the inner tower by means of the transfer device. A chain functioning as<br>
a pulling device (4) has been arranged to go inside the vertical tower, it reaches the<br>
slide in the inner tower inside the vertical tower and has been attached to an<br>
attaching element or to the fastening pivot 13 in the slide. In addition, there is a<br>
supporting element or a chain wheel 14 in the slide, through which the pulling<br>
element has been directed to go to the fastening pivot. The chain wheel 14 has been<br>
attached with an axle to the inner tower and on the sides of the slide elongated<br>
openings or holes 15 have been formed for the axle of the chain wheel such that the<br>
chain wheel stays in place while moving the slide. To the other end of the slide<br>
reaching outside the inner tower, a supporting part 16 has been formed, which<br>
supporting part is supported against the outer surface of the inner tower, and in that<br>
case it may move the inner tower towards the outer tower.<br>
There are openings 17 functioning as attaching points in a recognized way at a<br>
certain distance from each other on the vertical tower and the upper tower of the<br>
straightening tower, in which case the turning chain wheels 18 functioning as<br>
attaching devices of the pulling element may be fastened to a desired point in the<br>
straightening tower and the pulling device is possible to reach the construction of<br>
the car from the desired direction. In addition, figure 2 illustrates with dashed lines<br>
the vertical tower in its various positions. In addition, figure 2 illustrates a<br>
supporting arm 9 fastened with the attaching element 19 to an attaching point,<br>
which supporting arm is an elongated, shaft-like element in one end of which there<br>
is a wide support. In the attaching element (19) in question there is a hinge such<br>
that the supporting arm may be turned, to the desired position both in vertical and in<br>
horizontal directions in regard to the vertical tower and correspondingly to the car.<br>
One or more pushing rods may be used in the straightening bench.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a head attached to the slide of the transfer device 5. The transfer<br>
device is a double-action hydraulic cylinder fixed to the slide and the outer tower,<br>
hi addition, figure 3 illustrates the locking element 11 included in the device for<br>
attaching the slide detachable to the inner tower. The locking element is a locking<br>
pivot which may be placed to openings in the inner tower and to elongated openings<br>
made to the slide at the points of the openings.<br>
In addition the device comprises an adjusting device 12 attached to the outer surface<br>
of the outer tower and the inner tower, which adjusting device has been illustrated<br>
in figure 2. There are screw guides 20 in the adjusting arm functioning as an<br>
adjusting device, by means of which the position of the adjusting arm may be<br>
changed. By adjusting the screw guides of the adjusting arm the motion of the inner<br>
tower may be adjusted in regard to the outer tower relatively easily and simply.<br>
While using the straightening bench in accordance with figures the straightening<br>
bench and the straightening tower are placed to the desired point of the car and the<br>
pulling element 4 is attached to the desired point of the car body or to some other<br>
construction. Before straightening pull, the supporting ami 9 is placed to its place<br>
against the car 10 in a way presented in figure 5, for example. By means of the<br>
pulling move of the hydraulic cylinder the slide, the inner tower and the<br>
straightening tower may be moved towards the car and the supporting arm kept in<br>
place and to support the body area at its point. After this the pulling move of the<br>
hydraulic cylinder is locked with the locking device and the pushing move is<br>
changed to the hydraulic cylinder, that is, the slide is moved with the hydraulic<br>
cylinder to the right, to the direction of the arrow illustrated in figure 3. In this case<br>
the slide moves right and the pulling element moves with it, in which case the<br>
pulling element gets tighter and the actual straightening pull is achieved.<br>
While the slide is locked to the inner tower with the locking pivot and the slide is<br>
moved with the hydraulic cylinder to the opposite direction, that is, to the left in<br>
figure 3, the inner tower and the straightening tower are moved with the slide to that<br>
direction, In this case the supporting arm is located against the car body and a<br>
pushing movement is achieved. The length of the pushing/supporting movement of<br>
the pushing rod is limited with the adjusting device by adjusting the adjusting<br>
device to a certain point, in which case the motion stops while the adjusting arm reaches that certain point.<br>
Various kinds of functions related to straightening may be carried out with the<br>
straightening bench. By means of it, a traditional pulling motion may be provided<br>
in the way presented earlier. In addition, while using the same device desired points<br>
of a car may be supported simultaneously during pulling. Further, the device may<br>
be used only to push some car body area away. The device may also be applied in<br>
periodical pull/push motion, in which case the move of the hydraulic cylinder is<br>
changed at certain intervals and successive pulling and pushing functions are<br>
created.<br>
The invention is not limited to the presented advantageous application but it can<br>
vary within the frames of the idea of the invention formed in the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
