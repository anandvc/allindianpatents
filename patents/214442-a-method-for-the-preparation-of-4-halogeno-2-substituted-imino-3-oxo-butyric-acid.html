US patent number 5,095,149 describes a process for the preparation of 4-halogeno-2- methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid of the formula (I) by brominating the methoxy imino compound of general formula (III) by bromine in mixture of IPE and ethylene dichloride. Ethylene dichloride is a toxic solvent and hence its use in the preparation of pharmaceuticals has to be avoided.<br>
US patent number 5,109,131 describes a process for the preparation of 4-halogeno-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid of the formula (I) starting with the reaction of diketene and tert-butyl alcohol, followed by oximation, methylation, hydrolysis and halogenation.

After being stirred at -28 째C ~ -10째C for 1 hour, add ice-water (25 ml). The separated organic layer was washed with water (75 ml). The organic solution was dried and condensed under reduced pressure to give 5.0 gm of the required product.<br>
Step (IV)<br>
Cyclisation with thiourea<br>
Tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) and water (25 ml) were charged into the reaction flask followed by the addition of condensed product (5.0 gm) obtained in step (III) above, thiourea(0.9 gm) and sodium acetate (2.8 gm). Stirred the reaction mixture at room temperature for 3 hrs. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. After completion of reaction, sodium chloride (48.0 gm) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The tetrahydrofuran layer was separated and was added THF (80 ml), charcoal (0.5 gm) stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. To the THF layer MgS04 (5.0 gm) was added to remove the traces of water, decanted the THF layer, to which sodium-2-ethyl hexanoate (3.1 gm) in THF (20 ml) was added. Precipitation of the product started after 1 hr of stirring. The precipitated Ceftiofur sodium was filtered and washed with acetone (3.2 gm, Purity 98.0 %).<br><br>

Step fI)<br>
Synthesis of diethyl -(4-chloro-2-methoxyimino-3-oxabutrate) phosphoridate<br>
4-chloro-2-methoxyimino-3-oxobutyric acid (3.0 gm) obtained in example 1 or 2 was suspended in dichloromethane (24 ml) . Triethylamine (0.90 gm) was added into this solution and then diethylchlorophosphoridate (24.52 gm) was also added thereto over 20 minutes while maintaining the solution under nitrogen atmosphere at 0 째C to 5 째C. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours. After the reaction was completed, distilled water (25 ml) was added to the reaction solution and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The organic layer was separated, washed successively with 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (25 ml) and saturated saline (25 ml), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and then concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 5.9 gm of the title compound.<br>
Step -II<br>
Silylation	of	7-amino-3-[(2-furanylcarbonyl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid :<br>
To a solution of 7-amino-3-[(2-furanylcarbonyl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (6.8 gm, 1.2 mol) in ethyl acetate(68 ml) N,0-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) (16.6 gm, 4.0 mol) was added drop wise at room temperature and continued stirring for 2-3 hrs at the same temperature.<br>
Step -III<br><br>
Condensation	of	diethyl-(4-chloro-2-methoxyimino-3-oxabutrate)<br>
phosphoridate and silylated 7-amino-3-[(2-furanyIcarbonyI)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
The suspension of the activated reagent obtained in step (I) above was added to the silylated 7-amino-3-[(2-furanylcarbonyl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid obtained in step (II) above at -25 째C. After stirring for 1 hour at -30 째C to -10 째C, ice-water (25 ml) was added. The separated organic layer was washed with water (75 ml). The organic solution was dried and condensed under reduced pressure to give 7.5 gm of the required product.<br>
Step (IV)<br>
Cyclisation with thiourea<br>
Tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) and water (25 ml) were charged into the reaction flask followed by the addition of condensed product (5.0 gm) obtained in step (III) above, thiourea (0.9 gm) and sodium acetate (2.8 gm). Stirred the reaction mixture at room temperature for 3 hrs. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC.
