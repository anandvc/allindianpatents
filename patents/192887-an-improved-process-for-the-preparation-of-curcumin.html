Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of curcumin. Curcumin has variety of uses such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antioxidant agents .<br>
Curcuminoids are characteristic yellow coloring components of turmeric, Curcuma fonga and of other Curcuma species. Chemically they are phenolic diarylheptanoids having diverse physiological activities including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antioxidant activities. The most important constituent of commercial value is curcumin.<br>
The major processes known in the prior art for the preparation of curcumin are the following<br>
i) Pabon's route (H. J. J. Pabon Rec. Trav. Chim. 1964 83, 379) This route involves the reaction of vanillin and acetylacetone in the presence of boric oxide, trialkyl borate and a primary amine. The synthetic strategy of Pabon was followed in the route followed by Graf which process omitted the use of trialkylborate ( reference may be made to E. Graf, Ger. Pat. 1,280,849, 24-10-1968; Ger. Pat. 1,282,642,14-11-1968). This process employs an expensive reagent namely Boric oxide and involves heating at 80 - 130^ i) Stieglitz's commercial synthesis of curcumin (A. Stieglitz and O. Horn, Ger. Pat. 859,145, 11-12-1952). In this process use is made to carboxy methoxy feruloyi chloride which is reacted with aluminum chloride in carbon disulphide. The resulting product is hydrolysed to get curcumin In this process the starting material Is very expensive and the work up of the product involves cumbersome procedure because it involves steam distillation. Further the resulting product is a mixture of curcumin isomers. This process is rarely used now.<br><br>
It is felt that there is a necessity to develop and improved process using inexpensive reagents and relatively mild reaction conditions.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of curcumin which is simple<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of curcumin using relatively mild conditions resulting in enormous savings making the process economical<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of curcumin which can be extended to other curcominoids and l,7-diaryl-l,6-diene'3,5-dione heptanoids in general.<br>
In the course of our work on Curcuma longa (turmeric) we have observed that curcumin is always obtained with two other curcuminoids, viz. desmethoxycurcumin and bisdesmethoxycurcumin which can be separated only by colunnn chromatography. Further the yield of mixed curcuminoids is only 4-6% and involves handling of large quantities of raw material such as which is finally to be discarded.<br>
Under the circumstances we explored the possibilities of developing other routes for the preparation of curcumin. We felt that use of an inexpensive substitute to boric oxide may be beneficial. The purpose of the use of boric oxide in the process of preparation of curcumin is mainly to block the active methylene group of acetylacetone from reacting with aryl aldehyde, thereby forming undesired by products such as arylidene derivatives.<br><br>
While studying the cliemical properties of curcumlnoids, we observed for the first time that they react with borontrifluoride to form difluoroboronites which can be cleaved to get back the original compounds. This observation prompted us to use the acetylacetone difluoroboronite In the place of acetylacetone and boric oxide previously used in the process for the preparation of curcumlnoids.<br>
We also observed that Borontrifluoride etherate (BF3-Et20) and acetylacetone are both commercially available and the boronite complex can be easily prepared (vide G.T. Morgan and R,B. Turnstall, J, Chem. Soc, 1924,125, 1963) and can be stored and used whenever required.<br>
Accordingly, the present Invention provides an Improved process for the synthesis of curcumin which comprises<br>
a)	treating vanillin in ethyl acetate or chloroform solution with acetylacetonedifluoroboronite,<br>
b)	adding a base catalyst under stirring at room temperature.<br>
c)	distilling off the solvent,<br>
d)	adding water and acidifying with IN hydrochloric acid   under stirring,<br>
e)	cooling, filtering, washing with water and drying the resulting product,<br>
f)	refluxing   the   product  from   step   (e)   with   80%   aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol after adjusting the pH to 5.5,<br>
g)	reducing the volume of the aqueous alcoholic solution,<br>
h) filtering the     separated product from step (f) and washing<br>
with water, i)  dissolving   the   product   in   aq.   alkali   and   extracting   with<br>
chloroform,<br><br>
j)  Acidifying   the  alkali  layer,   filtering   and   drying     the  said product.<br>
In a preferred ennbodlment of the invention 1 mole of acetylacetone-difluoroboronite Is used for 2 moles of vanillin. The ethyl acetate or chloroform used for dissolution of vanillin may be 250-300 ml for each mole of aldehyde used. The base catalyst employed for each mole of aldehyde may be A7-butylamine, morpholin and the like. The amount of the catalyst employed may be n-butylamine (0.08 to 0.1 mole) for each mole of aldehyde or 0.14 to 0.16 mole or morpholin. The catalyst may be added In small quantities at a time over a period of 35 to 45 min. The stirring after addition of base catalyst may be continued for a period In the range of 3-4 hrs.<br>
Acidification may be done with the addition of IN HCI drop-wise until a pH of 2-3 is reached.<br>
The aqueous methanol or ethanol used may preferably be 80% (20 ml of water for 80 ml of methanol or ethanol) and the refluxing, after adjustment of pH to ca. 5.5 with 1% NaOH, is for a period of 3-4 hrs. when the deep red color of the solution turns orange.<br>
Reduction of the volume of aq. methanol or aq. ethanol is to an extent of 2/3 the original volume. Dissolution of the separated product is done in 5% sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and the volume used is about 10 ml per each gram of the product.<br>
Extraction of the alkali solution may be done with chloroform twice using 1/3 of the volume of alkali solution each time and rejecting the chloroform extract.<br><br>
Acidification of tine alkali layer is done under continuous stirring at 5-10°C with cone, hydrociiloric acid added in small lots until the pH comes to 2-3.<br>
The resulting curcumin is obtained in an yield of 75-78% with a purity of ca 99%with n-butylamine as base catalyst and ca. 98% with morpholin as base catalyst.<br>
