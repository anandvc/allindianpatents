COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"SUBSTITUTED  PYRIDINES AND  PYRIDAZINES WITH  ANGIOGENESIS  INHIBITING ACTIVITY"<br>
BAYER CORPORATION, 100 Bayer Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15205, U.S.A.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
i <br><br>
FIELD:<br>
This application relates to small molecule heterocyclic pharmaceuticals, and more particularly, to substituted pyridines and pyndazines having angiogenesis inhibiting activity.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Vasculogenesis involves the de novo formation of blood vessels from endothelial cell precursors or angioblasts. The first vascular structures in the embryo are formed by vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis involves the development of capillaries from existing blood vessels, and is the principle mechanism by which organs, such as the brain and the kidney are vascularized. While vasculogenesis is restricted to embryonic development, angiogenesis can occur in the adult, for example during pregnancy, the female cycle, or wound healing.<br>
One major regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in both embryonic development and some angiogenic-dependent diseases is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also called vascular permeability factor, VPF). VEGF represents a family of mitogens isoforms resulting from alternative mRNA splicing and which exist in homodimeric forms. The VEGF KDR receptor is highly specific for vascular endothelial cells (for reviews, see: Farrara et al. Endocr. Rev. 1992, 13, 18; Neufield et al. FASEB J. 1999,13,9).<br>
VEGF expression is induced by hypoxia (Shweiki et al. Nature 1992, 359, 843), as well as by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-a and -β.<br>
To date VEGF and the VEGF family members have been reported to bind to one or more of three transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (Mustonen et al. J. Cell Biol., 1995, 129, 895), VEGF receptor-1 (also known as flt-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-!)); VEGFR-2 (also known as kinase insert domain containing receptor (KDR), the murine analogue of KDR being known as fetal liver kinase-1 (flk-1)); and VEGFR-3 (also known as flt-4)-. KDR and flt-1 have been shown to have different signal transduction properties (Waltenberger et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 26988); Park et al. Oncogene 1995, 10, 135).   Thus, KDR undergoes strong ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in intact<br><br>
cells, whereas flt-1 displays a weaker response.    Thus, binding to KDR is a critical requirement for induction of the full spectrum of  VEGF-mediated biological responses.<br>
In vivo, VEGF plays a central role in vasculogenesis, and induces angiogenesis and permeabilization of blood vessels. Deregulated VEGF expression contributes to the development of a number of diseases that are characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes. Regulation of the VEGF-mediated signal transduction cascade will therefore provide a useful mode for control of abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for growth of tumors beyond about 1-2 mm. Oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to cells in tumors smaller than this limit through diffusion. However, -every tumor is dependent on angiogenesis for continued growth after it has reached a certain size. Tumorigenic cells within hypoxic regions of tumors respond by stimulation of VEGF production, which triggers activation of quiescent endothelial cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation. (Shweiki et al. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., 1995, 92, 768). In addition, VEGF production in tumor regions where there is no angiogenesis may proceed through the ras signal transduction pathway (Grugel et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 25915; Rak et al. Cancer Res. 1995, 55, 4575). In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated VEGF mRNA is strongly upregulated in a wide variety of human tumors, including lung (Mattern et al. Br. J. Cancer 1996, 73, 931), thyroid (Viglietto et al. Oncogene 1995, 11, 1569), breast (Brown et al. Human Pathol. 1995, 26, 86), gastrointestional tract (Brown et al. Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 4727; Suzuki et al. Cancer Res. 1996, 56, 3004), kidney and bladder (Brown et al. Am. J. Pathol. 1993, 1431, 1255), ovary (Olson et al. Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 1255), and cervical (Guidi et al. J. Nat'l Cancer Inst. 1995, 87, 12137) carcinomas, as well as angiosacroma (Hashimoto et al. Lab, Invest. 1995, 73, 859) and several intracranial tumors (Plate et al. Nature 1992, 359, 845; Phillips et al. Int. J. Oncol. 1993, 2, 913; Berkman et al. J. Clin. Invest., 1993, 91, 153). Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to KDR have been shown to be efficacious in blocking tumor angiogenesis (Kim et al. Nature 1993, 362, 841; Rockwell et al. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1995,5,315).<br>
Overexpression of VEGF, for example under conditions of extreme hypoxia, can lead to intraocular angiogenesis, resulting In hyperproliferation of blood vessels, leading eventually to blindness. Such a cascade of events has been observed for a number of retinopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, ischemic retinal-vein occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity (Aiello et al. New Engl. J. Med. 1994, 331, 1480; Peer et al. Lab. Invest.<br><br>
1995, 72, 638), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see, Lopez et al. Invest. Opththalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996, 37, 855).<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the in-growth of vascular pannus may be mediated by production of angiogenic factors. Levels of immunoreactive VEGF are high in the synovial fluid of RA patients, while VEGF levels were low in the synovial fluid of patients with other forms of arthritis of with degenerative joint disease (Koch et al. /. Immunol. 1994, 152, 4149). The angiogenesis inhibitor AGM-170 has been shown to prevent neovascularization of the joint in the rat collagen arthritis model (Peacock et al. J. Exper. Med. 1992,175, 1135).<br>
Increased VEGF expression has also been shown in psoriatic skin, as well as bullous disorders associated with subepidermal blister formation, such as bullous pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis herpetiformis (Brown et al. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995,104, 744).<br>
Because inhibition of KDR signal transduction leads to inhibition of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and permeabilization, KDR inhibitors will be useful in treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes., including the above listed diseases<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Definitions:<br>
The prefix "lower" denotes a radical having up to and including a maximum of 7 atoms, especially up to and including a maximum of 5 carbon atoms, the radicals in question being either linear or branched with single or multiple branching.<br>
"Alkyl" means a hydrocarbon radical having up to a maximum of 12 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched with single or multiple branching. Alkyl is especially lower alkyl.<br>
Where the plural form is used for compounds, salts, and the like, this is taken to mean also a single compound, salt, or the like.<br>
Any asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)configuration, preferably in the (R)- or (S)-cofiguration. Substituents at a double bond or a ring may be present in cis- (= Z-) or trans (= E-) form. The compounds may thus be present as mixtures of isomers or as pure isomers, preferably as enantiomer-pure diastereomers and having pure cis- or trans- double bonds.<br><br>
Lower alkylene Y may be branched or linear but is preferably linear, especially methylene (-CH2), ethylene (-CH2-CH2), trimethylene (-CH2-CH2-CH2) or tetramethylene (-CH2CH2CH2CH2). When Y is lower alkylene, it is most preferably methylene.<br>
"Aryl" means an aromatic radical having 6 to 14 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, naphthyl, fluorenyl or phenanthrenyl.<br>
"Halogen" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine but is especially fluorine, chlorine, or bromine.<br>
"Pyridyl" means 1-, 2-, or 3-pyridyl but is especially 2- or 3-pyridyl.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" is a saturated carbocycle that contains between 3 and 12 carbons but preferably 3 to 8 carbons.<br>
"Cycloalkenyl" means a non-reactive and non-aromatic unsaturated carbocycle that contains between 3 and 12 carbons but preferably 3 to 8 carbons and up to three double bonds. It is well known to those skilled in the art that cycloalkenyl groups that differ from aromatics by lacking only one double bond such as cyclohaxadiene are not sufficiently non-reactive to be reasonable drug substances and therefor their use as substituents is not within the scope of this invention.<br>
Cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups may contain branch points such that they are substituted by alkyl or alkenyl groups. Examples of such branched cyclic groups are 3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl, 4-allylcyclohexyl or 3-ethylcyclopent-3-enyl.<br>
Salts are especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I such as, for example, acid addition salts, preferably with organic or inorganic acids, from compounds of formula I with a basic nitrogen atom. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, halogen acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, carboxylic, phosphonic, sulfonic, or sulfamic acids, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, -hydroxybutyric acid, gluconic acid, glucosemonocarboxylic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azeiaic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, glucaric acid, galactaric acid, amino acids, such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-methylglycine, acetytaminoacetic acid, N-acetylasparagine or N-acetylcysteine, pyruvic acid, acetoacetic acid, phosphoserine, 2- or 3-glycerophosphoric acid.<br>

In the definitions of G1, G2, G3, and G4 the statement is made that when two groups R3 or R6 are found on a single N, they can be combined into a heterocycle of 5-7 atoms. Examples of such heterocycles, including the N to which they are attached, are:<br><br>
"Heterocyclyl" or "heterocycle" means a five- to seven-membered heterocyclic system with 1-3 heteroatoms selected from the group nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which may be unsaturated or wholly or partly saturated, and is unsubstituted or substituted especially by lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, or tert-butyl.<br>
When an aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl ring is said to be optionally substituted, that ring may bear up to 5 substituents which are independently selected from the group consisting of amino, mono- or di-loweralkyl-substituted amino, lower alkanoylamino, halogeno, lower alkyl, halogenated lower alkyl such as trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, halogenated lower alkoxy such as trifluoromethoxy, halogenated lower alkylthio such as trifluoromethylthio, lower alkanoyloxy, -CO2R3, -CHO, -CH2OR3, -OC02R3, -CON(R6)2, -OCO N(R6)2, -NR3CON(R6)2, nitro, amidino, guanidino, mercapto, sulfo, and cyano.<br>
In the ring attached to Y, the ring members A, B, D, E, and L may be N or CH, it being understood that the optional substituents G3 are necessarily attached to carbon and<br><br>
not nitrogen, and that when a given carbon bears a substituent group G , that G group is in place of the H atom the carbon would bear in the absence of the G3 group.<br>
Examples of ring J together with two adjacent G4 moieties which taken together form a second fused ring are:<br><br><br><br><br>
"Heteroaryl" means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic system with between 5 and 10 atoms in total of which 1-4 are heteroatoms selected from the group comprising nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur and with the remainder being carbon. Heteroaryl is preferably a monocyclic system with 5 or 6 atoms in total, of which 1-3 are heteroatoms.<br>
"Alkenyl" means an unsaturated radical having up to a maximum of 12 carbon atoms and may be linear or branched with single or multiple branching and containing up to 3 double bonds. Alkenyl is especially lower alkenyl with up to 2 double bonds.<br>

Examples of such substituents are trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethylthio, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy, dichloromethyl, fluoromethyl and difluoromethyl.<br>
When a substituent is named as a string of fragments such as "phenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl-substituted alkylamino," it is understood that the point of attachment is to<br><br>
the final moiety of that string (in this case amino) and that the other fragments of that string are connected to each other in sequence as they are listed in the string. Thus an example of "phenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl-substituted alkylamino" is:<br><br>
When a substituent is named as a string of fragments with a bond at the start (typically written as a dash) such as "-S(0)p(optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl)", it is understood that the point of attachment is to the first atom of that string (in this case S or sulfur) and that the other fragments of that string are connected to each other in sequence as they are listed in the string. Thus an example of "-S(O)p(optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl)" is:<br><br><br><br>
It is to be understood that the left-most moiety of each of the variants of the linker Y is connected to the ring containing A, B, D, E, and L and that the right-most moiety of the linker is connected to the pyridazine fragment of the generalized formulae.

For example, a solution or suspension of a compound of Formula I in a suitable volatile solvent optionally containing penetration enhancing agents can be combined with additional additives known to those skilled in the art, such as matrix materials and bacteriocides. After sterilization, the resulting mixture can be formulated following known procedures into dosage forms. In addition, on treatment with emulsifying agents and water, a solution or suspension of a compound of Formula I may be formulated into a lotion or salve.<br>

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the particular method of administration will depend on a variety of factors, all of which are considered routinely when administering therapeutics. It will also be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any given patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to the activity of the specific compound employed, the age of the patient, the body weight of the patient, the general health of the patient, the gender of the patient, the diet of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combinations, and the severity of the condition undergoing therapy.

GENERAL PREPARATIVE METHODS<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures. Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are presented to aid the reader in synthesizing the KDR inhibitors, with more detailed particular examples being presented below in the experimental section describing the working examples.<br>
All variable groups of these methods are as described in the generic description if they are not specifically defined below. When a variable group or substituent with a given symbol (i.e. R3, R4, R6, G1, G2, G3, or G4) is used more than once in a given structure, it is to be understood that each of these groups or substituents may be independently varied within the range of definitions for that symbol. As defined above, the compounds of the invention contain ring units each of which may independently bear between 0 and 5 substituents G1, G3, or G4, which are not defined as H. By contrast, it is to be noted that in the general method schemes below, the G1, G3, or G4 substituents are used as if their definition includes H, to show where such G1, G3, or G4 substituents may exist in the<br><br>
structures, and for ease in drawing. No change in the definition of G , G , or G is intended by this non-standard usage, however. Thus, only for purposes of the general method schemes below, G1, G3, or G4 may be H in addition to the moieties set forth in the definitions of G1, G3, or G4. The ultimate compounds contain 0 to 5 non-hydrogen groups G',G3, or G4.<br>
Within these general methods the variable M is equivalent to the moiety<br>
  in which each variable group or substituent is allowed to independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol.<br>
Within these general methods the variable Q1 is equivalent to the moiety<br>
  in which L is N and each other variable group or substituent is allowed to independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol. Within these general methods the variable Q2 is equivalent to the moiety<br>
  in   which   each   variable  group   or   substituent  is   allowed   to independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol.<br>
It is recognized that compounds of the invention with each claimed optional functional group cannot be prepared with each of the below-listed methods. Within the scope of each method optional substituents are used which are stable to the reaction conditions, or the functional groups which may participate in the reactions are present in protected form where necessary, and the removal of such protective groups is completed at appropriate stages by methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
General Method A - The compounds of formula I-A in which X, M, and Q2 are defined as above, Y is -CH2-0-, -CH2-S-, -CH2-NH-, -O-, -S-, or -NH-, and R1 and R2 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5-membered ring aromatic heterocycle, hal is halogen (Cl, Br, F, or I but preferably CI, Br or F) are conveniently prepared according to a reaction sequence as shown in Method A. Thus, a heterocycle of formula II in which R is lower alkyl can be made by one skilled in the art according to the corresponding published procedures in the reference table. In the cases of thiophene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (table entry 1) and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid<br><br>
(table entry 10), the carboxylic acids are converted to methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with the corresponding alcohol and catalytic mineral acid (typically sulfuric acid) at reflux. The diester of formula II is treated with hydrazine hydrate to furnish intermediate III (for specific reaction conditions see Robba, M.; Le Guen, Y. Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr... 1970 12 4317). Compound III is treated with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous oxybromide, phosphorous pentabromide, or phosphorous pentachloride to yield dihalo intermediate IV. The dichloro or dibromo intermediates can be converted to the difluoro intermediate (when desired) by reaction with hydrogen fluoride. By using iodo reagents such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide in subsequent steps, the iodo intermediate is formed in the reaction mixtures without being isolated as a pure substance. Dihalo intermediate IV is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol or other suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), dimethylformatmide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or the like to furnish the intermediate of formula VI. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such as triethylamine or l,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The compound of formula VI is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CSCO4, or a crown ether such as 18-crown-6 at temperatures usually between room temperature and reflux to furnish invention compound of formula I-A. It is understood that the nature of the starting materials will dictate the choice of suitable solvents, catalyst (if used) and temperature by one skilled in the art. Intermediates of formula V and VII are often commercial or are conveniently prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example see Martin, I., et al. Acta. Chem. Scand.. 1995 49 230 for the preparation of VII in which Y is -CH2-O- and Q2 is 4-pyridyl substituted by a 2-aminocarbonyl group (2-CONH2).<br><br><br><br>

General Method B - The compounds of formula I-B in which M, X, and Q2 are as defined above and Y is -CH2-O-, -CH2-S-, -CH2-NH-, -O-, -S-, or -NH- are conveniently prepared as shown in Method B. According to a procedure described in the literature (Tomisawa and Wang, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 21, 1973, 2607, 2612), isocarbostyril VIII is reacted with PBr5 in a melt to form 1,4-dibromoisoquinoline IX. Intermediate IX is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish intermediate of formula X. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such as triethylamine or 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The compound of formula X is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CsC04 at elevated temperatures to furnish invention compound of formula I-B. This method is most useful when Y is -CH2-S- or -S-.<br><br><br>
Method B<br>
General Method C - The compounds of formula I-C in which M, X, R1, R2, m and Q2 are defined as above are conveniently prepared according by a reaction sequence as shown in method C. In this method m is preferably 0 and R1 and R2 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused benzene or fused 5-member ring aromatic heterocycle. Starting material XI is either commercial or is prepared by one skilled in the art as shown in the reference table below. Starting material XI is reacted with urea or ammonia, usually at elevated temperature and pressure (in the case of ammonia), to form imide XII. The imide is reacted with an aldehyde XIII in acetic acid and piperidine at reflux to yield intermediate XIV. Reaction of XIV with sodium borohydride in methanol or other suitable solvents according to the general procedure described by I.W. Elliott and Y. Takekoshi (J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1976 13, 597) yields intermediate XV. Treatment of XV with a suitable halogenating agent such as POCl3, POBr3, PC15, PBr5 or thionyl chloride yields halo intermediate XVI which is reacted with nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish invention compound of formula I-C. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or l,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Alternatively, reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XV be heating the two components with P2O5 in a melt to yield invention compound of structure I-C. This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker.<br><br>
Method C<br><br>
REFERENCE TABLE FOR PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALS<br><br><br><br>
General Method D - The compounds of formula I-D-l in which R1, R2, R6, M, X, Y, G3 and Z are defined as above and q is 0 or I are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method D. Thus, pyridine substituted pyridazines or pyridines (I-D-1) are functionalized into substituted 2-aminocarbonyl pyridines of formula (I-D-2) by the use of formamides (XVII) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron salts, according to a procedure described in the literature (Minisci et al., Tetrahedron, 1985, 41, 4157). This method works best when R1 and R2 together constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle. In those cases that Z is CH and R1 and R2 do not form a fused aromatic, an isomeric side product in which Z is CCONHR6 can be formed and, if so formed, is removed from the desired product by chromatography.<br>
Method D<br><br><br>
General Method E -The compounds of formula I-E-1 and I-E-2 in which R1, R2, R6, M, X, Y, G3, and Z are defined as above, q is 0 or 1, and R3 is lower alkyl are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method E. Thus, pyridine substituted pyridazines or pyridines (I-D-l) are functionalized into substituted 2-alkoxycarbonyl pyridines of formula (I-E-1) by the use of monoalkyloxalates (XVIII) in the presence of S2S8-2 acid and catalytic amounts of AgN03, according to a procedure described in the literature (Coppa, F. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33 (21), 3057). Compounds of formula I-E-1 in which R3 is H are then formed by hydrolysis of the ester with a base such as sodium hydroxide in methanol / water. Compounds of formula I-E-2 in which the R6 groups are independently defined as above, but especially including those compounds in which neither R6 is H, are conveniently prepared from the acid (I-E-1, R3 = H) by treatment with amine XIX in the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide). This method works best when R1 and R2 together constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle. In those cases that Z is CH and R1 and R2 do not form a fused aromatic, an isomeric side product in which Z is CCO2R3 can be formed in the first step and, if so formed, is removed from the desired product by chromatography.<br>
Method E<br><br>
General Method F - The compounds of formula I-F in which M, Q2 and X are defined as above, m is an integer of 1 - 5, and R1 and R2 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5-membered ring aromatic heterocycle can be prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in method F. The readily available heterocyclylcarboxylic acid starting material XX is reacted with butyl lithium followed by dimethylformamide to yield the aldehyde with structure XXI.    Reaction of XXI with<br><br>
hydrazine yields pyridazinone XXII. . Treatment of XXII with a suitable halogenating agent such as POCI3, POBr3, PCI5, PBr5 or thionyl chloride yields a halo intermediate which is reacted with nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish intermediate compound of formula XXIII. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such as triethylamine or 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Alternatively, reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XXII be heating the two components with P2O5 in a melt to yield XXII. This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker. Formation and alkylation of the Reissert compound XXIII with halide XXIV is done as described by the general method of F.D. Popp, Heterocycles, 1980, 14, 1033 to yield the intermediate of structure XXV. Treatment of XXV with base then yields invention compound I-F. Method F<br><br>
General Method G - The compounds of formula I-G in which M, Q2 and X are defined as above, m is an integer of 1 - 4, and R1 and R2 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5-membered ring aromatic heterocycle can be prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in method G. Aldehyde XXI, from method F, can be reduced with sodium borohydride to yield a hyroxyacid which is lactonized using methods well known to those skilled in the art such as with toluenesulfonyl chloride to yield lactone XXVI.    Condensation of intermediate XXVI with aldehyde XIII in the<br><br>
presence of a base such aS sodium methoxide usually in a solvent such as methanol under reflux yields an intermediate °f structure XXVII. Reaction of XXVII with hydrazine or preferably with hydrazine hydrate at a temperature of 100 - 150°C leads to an intermediate of structure XXVIII. Convers'on °f intermediate XXVIII to invention compound of structure I-G is done by (Methods as described in method C by using XXVIII rather than XV. '<br><br><br>
XXVII<br><br>
General Method H - The compounds of formula I-H in which the R , R , M, X,<br>
R6, q and G3 are defined as above are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method H. Tr*us tne methods described in Martin, I; Anvelt, J.; Vares, L.; Kuehn, I.; Claesson, A. Acta Chem, Scand. 1995, 49, 230-232 or those of methods D or E above by substituting realty available pyridme-4-carboxyHc ester XXX for I-D-l are used to convert XXX into XXXI. Reduction of the ester as described by Martin, et al. above is next done with a m^ reducing agent such as NaBH4 such that the amide substiruent is left unchanged to yield alcohol XXXII. This alcohol is then heated with a base such as DBU or CsC04 with halopyridazine VI from method A under anhydrous conditions to yield the invention compound with formula I-H.<br><br>
Method H<br><br>
C02R3<br><br>
C02Rd	CH2OH<br><br>
General Method I - Invention compounds having formula I-I in which the R , R , M, X, R6, q, and G3 are defined as above and W is a bond or -CH2- are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method I. This method is especially useful when q is 1 and XXXIII is 4-chloropyridine. Alternatively, other 4-halopyridines such as 4-fluoropyridine or 4-bromopyridine can be used in this process. Thus readily available 4-halopyridines XXXIII are converted to intermediates of formula XXXIV by using the general procedures of methods D or E above by substituting the 4-halopyridine for I-D-l. Reaction of XXXIV with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide yields a thiol having formula XXXV. Alternatively, the alcohol function of intermediate XXXII from method H is converted to a leaving group by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride and a suitable base such as triethylamine in the cold such that polymeric material formation is minimized and the resultant intermediate is reacted with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide to yield a thiol having formula XXXVI. Either thiol have formula XXXV or formula XXXVI is reacted with intermediate VI from method A and a suitable base such as diisopropylethylamine or CsC04 in DMF or other suitable anhydrous solvent or in the absence of solvent to yield I-D-9.<br><br><br>
Method I<br>
General Method J - Invention compounds such as those having formula I-J-1 or I-J-2 in which the R1, R2, M, X, W, and G3 are defined as above and having a sulfoxide or sulfone within the structure are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method J. Reaction of compounds of this invention that contain a thioether group either as part of a substituent G1, G3, or G4or as part of Y as shown in the representative structure I-I from Method I can be converted to the invention compounds with a sulfoxide moiety such as I-J-l by treatment with one equivalent of m-chloroperbenzoic acid in methylene chloride or chloroform (MCPBA, Synth. Commun., 26, 10, 1913-1920, 1996) or by treatment with sodium periodate in methanol/water at between 0 °C and room temperature (J. Org. Chem., 58, 25, 6996-7000, 1993). The expected side products consisting of mixtures of various N oxides and the sulfone I-J-2 can be removed by chromatography. The sulfone I-J-2 is obtained by the use of an additional equivalent of MCPBA or preferably by use of potassium permanganate in acetic acid/water (Eur. J. Med. Chem. Then, 21,1, 5-8, 1986) or by use of hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid (Chem. Heterocycl. Compd., 15, 1085-1088, 1979). In those cases that unwanted N oxides become a significant product, they can be converted back to the desired sulfoxides or sulfones by<br><br>

Step 1: A stirred solution of ethyl isonicotinate (250 mL, 1.64 mole) and concentrated sulfuric acid (92 mL, 1.64 mole) in N-methylformamide (2.0 L) was cooled to 6°C with an ice bath. Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (22.8 g, 0.0812 mole, milled with a mortar and pestle) was added, followed by the dropwise addition of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (56 mL, 0.492 mole). The additions of iron (II) sulfate and hydrogen peroxide were repeated four additional times, while the reaction temperature was kept below 22°C. After the reaction mixture was stirred for thirty minutes, sodium citrate solution (2 L, 1 M) was added (pH of the resulting mixture was about 5). The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (1L, 2 x 500 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (2 x 500 mL), 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 x 100 mL), and brine (500 mL). The resulting organic solution was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a solid. The crude solid was triturated with hexanes, filtered, washed with hexanes and dried under vacuum to give 270.35 g (79.2%) of pastel yellow solid.

Examples 106 -114: Preparation of Salts of Example 14.<br>
The product of Example 14 (1.50 g, 3.66 mmol) was stirred as a slurry in methanol (20 ml) as a solution of toluenesulfonic acid hydrate (0.701 g, 3.67 mmol) in methanol (5 ml plus 5 ml rinse) was added quickly dropwise. All materials dissolved over 5 min to yield a yellow solution. Anhydrous ether (30 ml) was added and stirring was continued for 5 minutes until solid began to precipitate. The resultant mixture was chilled with stirring in an ice/water bath for 45 minutes and then the solid title product (Example 104) was collected by filtration, washed with ether and dried at 55 °C in a vacuum oven until NMR analysis showed a lack of solvents (1.5 hours). Other compounds were prepared in a similar way by using a variety of acids rather than toluenesulfonic acid. Scale up and use of less methanol in the first step generally led to quicker precipitation of salts and a variety of solvents were used rather than ether, as indicated, to help crystalize the individual salts. In some cases the methanol was first removed by evaporation in vacuo. Final drying took between 1.5 hours and several days, depending on the quantity of material and the specific specific acid used.<br>

* The disalt with HCl was isolated rather than the 1:1 salt.  This occurred even if less than 2 equivalents of acid were used.<br>
Biological Protocols and in vitro Test Data<br>
KPR Assay:<br>
The cytosolic kinase domain of KDR kinase was expressed as a 6His fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. The KDR kinase domain fusion protein was purified over a Ni++ chelating column. Ninety-six well ELISA plates were coated with 5 μg poly(Glu4;Tyrl) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) in 100 μl HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Thimerosal) at 4° overnight. Before use, the plate was washed with HEPES, NaCl buffer and the plates were blocked with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in HEPES, NaCl buffer.<br>
Test compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO from 4 mM to 0.12 μM in half-log dilutions. These dilutions were further diluted twenty fold in H20 to obtain compound solutions in 5% DMSO. Following loading of the assay plate with 85 Μ.1 of assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 0.05%<br><br>
glycerol, 0.005% Triton X-100, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, with or without 3.3 μM ATP), 5 ul of the diluted compounds were added to a final assay volume of 100 μl. Final concentrations were between 10 μ-M, and 0.3 nM in 0.25% DMSO. The assay was initiated by the addition of 10μl (30 ng) of KDR kinase domain.<br>
The assay was incubated with test compound or vehicle alone with gentle agitation at room temperature for 60 minutes. The wells were washed and phosphotyrosines (PY) were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), mAb clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). PY/anti-PY complexes were detected with an anti-mouse IgG/HRP conjugate (Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, England). Phosphotyrosine was quantitated by incubating with 100 ul 3, 3', 5, 5' tetramethylbenzidine solution (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB Microwell 1 Component peroxidase substrate). Color development was arrested by the addition of 100 ul 1% HC1-based stop solution (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB 1 Component Stop Solution).<br>
Optical densities were determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in a 96-well plate reader, SpectraMax 250 (Molecular Devices). Background (no ATP in assay) OD values were subtracted from all ODs and the percent inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>
% Inhibition = (OD(vehicle control) - OD(with compound)) X 100 OD(vehicle control) - OD(no ATP added)<br>
The IC50 values were determined with a least squares analysis program using compound concentration versus percent inhibition. Compounds that have IC50  1,000 nM include those of examples 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 41, 77, 80, 81, and 94. Example numbers not in this list may be assumed to be weakly active, with IC50 values greater than 1 μM.<br><br>
Celt mechanistic assay-Inhibition of 3T3 KDR phosphorylation:<br>
NIH3T3 cells expressing the fall length KDR receptor were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, low glucose, 25 mM /L sodium pyruvate, pyridoxine hydrochloride and 0.2 mg/ ml of G418 (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). The cells were maintained in collagen I-coated T75 flasks (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) in a humidified 5% C02 atmosphere at 37°C.<br>
Fifteen thousand cells were plated into each well of a collagen I-coated 96-well plate in the DMEM growth medium. Six hours later, the cells were washed and the medium was replaced with DMEM without serum. After overnight culture to quiesce the cells, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY) with 0.1% bovine albumin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO). After adding various concentrations (0-300 nM) of test compounds to the cells in 1% final concentration of DMSO, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The cells were then treated with VEGF (30 ng / ml) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following VEGF stimulation, the buffer was removed and the cells were lysed by addition of 150 μl of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, supplemented with 10% glycerol, 50 mM BGP, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaV04, and 0.3% TX-100) at 4°C for 30 minutes.<br>
To assess receptor phosphorylation, 100 microliters of each cell lysate was added to the wells of an ELISA plate precoated with 300 ng of antibody C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz , CA). Following a 60-minute incubation, the plate was washed and bound KDR was probed for phosphotyrosine using an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The plate was washed and wells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG/HRP conjugate (Amersham International pic, Buckinghamshire, England) for 60 minutes. Wells were washed and phosphotyrosine was quantitated by addition of 100 pi per well of 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB Microwell 1 Component peroxidase substrate) solution. Color development was arrested by the addition of 100 ul 1% HC1 based stop solution (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB 1 Component Stop Solution).<br>
Optical densities (OD) were determined spectrophofomerrically at 450 run in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices). Background (no VEGF added) OD values were subtracted from all ODs and percent inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br><br>
% Inhibition = (OD(VEGF control) - OD(with test compound)) X 100 OD(VEGF control) - OD(no VEGF added)<br>
IC50S were determined on some of the exemplary materials with a least squares analysis program using compound concentration versus percent inhibition. Compounds that have IC50 
Matrigel® Angiogenesis Model:<br>
Preparation of Matrigel Plugs and in vivo Phase: Matrigel® (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) is a basement membrane extract from a murine tumor composed primarily of laminin, collagen IV and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It is provided as a sterile liquid at 4° C, but rapidly forms a solid gel at 37° C.<br>
Liquid Matrigel at 4° C was mixed with SK-MEL2 human tumor cells that were transfected with a plasmid containing the murine VEGF gene with a selectable marker. Tumor cells were grown in vitro under selection and cells were mixed with cold liquid Matrigel at a ratio of 2 X 106 per 0.5 ml. One half milliliter was implanted subcutaneously near the abdominal midline using a 25 gauge needle. Test compounds were dosed as solutions in Ethanol/ Cremaphor EL/saline (12.5%:12.5%:75%) at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg po once daily starting on the day of implantation. Mice were euthanized 12 days post-implantation and the Matrigel pellets were harvested for analysis of hemoglobin content.<br>
Hemoglobin Assay: The Matrigel pellets were placed in 4 volumes (w/v) of 4° C Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.5, ImM EGTA, ImM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 [EM Science, Gibbstown, N.J.], and complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Mannheim, Germany]), and homogenized at 4°C. Homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 minutes with shaking and centrifuged at 14K x g for 30 minutes at 4° C. Supenatants were transferred to chilled microfuge tubes and stored at 4° C for hemoglobin assay.<br>
Mouse hemoglobin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was suspended in autoclaved water (BioWhittaker, Inc, Walkersville, MD.) at 5 mg/ ml.  A standard curve<br><br>
was generated from 500 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml in Lysis Buffer (see above). Standard curve and lysate samples were added at 5 microliters /well in duplicate to a polystyrene 96-well plate. Using the Sigma Plasma Hemoglobin Kit (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), TMB substrate was reconstituted in 50 mis room temperature acetic acid solution. One hundred microliters of substrate was added to each well, followed by 100 microliters/well of Hydrogen Peroxide Solution at room temperature. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.<br>
Optical densities were determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm in a 96-well plate reader, SpectraMax 250 Microplate Spectrophotometer System (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Background Lysis Buffer readings were subtracted from all wells.<br>
Total sample hemoglobin content was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
Total Hemoglobin = (Sample Lysate Volume) x (Hemoglobin Concentration)<br>
The average Total Hemoglobin of Matrigel samples without cells was subtracted from each Total Hemoglobin Matrigel sample with cells. Percent inhibition was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
% Inhibition = (Average Total Hemoglobin Drug-Treated Tumor Lysates) X 100 (Average Total Hemoglobin Non-Treated Tumor Lysates)<br>
Example 8 showed significant activity in this assay at 100 and 300 mg/kg po sid with &gt; 60% inhibition of total hemoglobin content of the Matrigel samples from the dosed animals vs. those from vehicle control animals. The other examplary materials were not tested in this model.<br>
