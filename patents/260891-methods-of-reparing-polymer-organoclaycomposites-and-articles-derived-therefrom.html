FIELD<br>
This invention is directed to methods of preparing polymer-organoclay composites and uses of such composites, for example in the formation of a solvent cast film. The present disclosure also describes a solvent cast film comprising a polyimide and methods for the manufacture of such articles. The film is formed by polymerization of a dianhydride component and a diamine component, and has a Tg of between 180°C and 450°C, specifically 190°C or greater, and wherein the fitai has: a) a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C; b) a thickness between 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers, specifically 5 to 250 micrometers; and, c) contains less than 5% residual solvent by weight.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic sheets and films have a broad range of applications. For instance, thermoplastic films and sheets can be found in automotive applications, electronic applications, military applications, appliances, industrial equipment, and furniture.<br>
One important use of films is their use as substrates, or coatings on, flexible circuit applications. In order to serve in this role a new film should meet two requirements critical for flexible circuit substrates, namely low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high temperature survivability (especially when a high temperature fabrication step is employed).<br>
Low CTE is necessary to match, as closely as possible, the CTE of copper (CTE = 17 ppm/°C). This keeps the film from curling upon temperature change when the film is a substrate for a copper layer, or copper circuit traces. Low CTE also prevents unmatched changes in dimension between the copper and substrate layers upon thermal cycling, which increases the lifetime of the final flexible circuit by reducing stress and fatigue on the patterned copper traces. In other words, the properties of flexible circuit boards are benefited when their film substrate and applied conductive metal layer expand and contract at the same rate. When these layers don't expand and contract at the same rate issues regarding the adhesion , and orientation of the layers can and do arise While a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C, even more specifically less than 30 ppm/°C will allow low warpage upon thermal cycling and is a common goal, better results will be achieved as the CTE of the film becomes closer to the CTE of copper.<br>
CTE is tested by a TMA or Thermomechanical Analysis. The dimension change of a film sample is determined as a fiinction of temperature, and from the slope of this change, the CTE is calculated. Typically, the CTE must be measured for the temperature range that the film is expected to see during flex circuit processing. A temperature range of 20 to 250°C is a reasonable temperature range for determination of the CTE<br>
High temperature survivability can also be an important property for the substrate film to survive the soldering process during flex circuit fabrication The film should exhibit survivability for short periods at elevated temperatures of, for example, 260°C for new lead-free soldering processes The standard tesi for temperature survivability is the solder float test, where a small piece of fihn is affixed to a cork and is immersed for 10 seconds in molten solder. The film is then removed, the solder is wiped off, and the fihn is examined If there is any visible warpage or bubbling, the film fails the test. While there is not a standard thickness for this test, the mmimum thickness at which the film passes the solder float test can be reported. Temperatures of 260°C and 288°C are standard solder float temperatures for lead-eutectic and lead-free solders, respectively.<br>
Low CTE and high temperature resistance requirements for flexible circuit substrates have been addressed through the use of polyimide films. Many commercial polyimide (PI) films have a high glass transition temperature (greater than 350°C), and can be partially crosslinked, giving exceptional temperature survivability. The polymer molecules in these films are stressed slightly as they are produced, leading to alignment of the polymer molecules and giving PI films a low CTE. Since the films never see temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the material, the stress is never able to relax and the films are dimensionally stable at flex fabrication temperatures<br>
As thermoplastic sheets and films are used in an increasing wide array of applications the need for thermoplastic sheets and films that can withstand elevated temperatures for appropriate periods of time without substantial degradation is growing. There is a continuing need for films having: a) a CTE under seventy ppm/°C, specifically under thirty ppm/°C and as close to the CTE of copper as technically possible; and b) high thermal survivability<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As thermoplastic sheets and films are used in the specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings The singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill m the art. Compounds are described using standard nomenclature<br>
Other than in the operating examples or where otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and the like, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified m all instances by the term "about." The term "combination thereof means that one or more of the listed components is present, optionally together with one or more like components not listed. Various numerical ranges are disclosed in this patent application. Because these ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations The endpoints of all ranges directed to the same component or property are inclusive of the endpoint and independently combinable.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, a "film" is a flat section of thermoplastic resin or other material that is extremely thin in comparison to its length and breadth.<br>
The term "casting" refers to a process of molding or forming wherein impressions are made with fluent or molten materials as by pouring into a mold or onto a sheet with hardening or setting of said material in said mold or on said sheet.<br>
A "solvent cast film" is a film formed through the casting of fluids on a forming surface to form a sheet or web with removal of solvent from the cast liquid.<br>
All ASTM tests and data are from the 1991 edition of the Annual Book of ASTM Standards unless otherwise indicated.<br>
"Coefficient of thermal, expansion" is the increment in volume of a unit volume of polymer for a rise of temperature of 1°C at constant pressure. For the present invention CTE measurements were performed by thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) with a thermal ramp rate of 5°C/minute. Test specimen dimensions were 23 mm in length by 5 mm m width Test specimens were subjected to a first heat from 0°C to 250°C at 5°C/min heating rate and CTE values were determined under a force of 0.05 Newtons from the slope of length change over the temperature range from 30°C to 200°C.<br>
"Chemical resistance" is the ability of solid materials to resist damage by chemical reactivity or solvent action, and can be determined in accordance with ASTM Test D543-06<br>
"Dielectric Constanf' (permittivity constant): between any two electrically charged bodies there is a force (attraction or repulsion) that varied according to the strength of the charges, ql and q2, the distance between the bodies, r, and a characteristic of the medium separating the bodies (the dielectric) known as the dielectric constant, e. This force is given by the equation: F = ql-q2/(ε-r2).<br>
"Flexural Modulus" (flex modulus) is the ratio, within the elastic limit, of the applied stress in the outermost fibers of a test specimen in three-point, static flexure, to the calculated strain in those outermost fibers, and can be determined accordmg to ASTM Test D790 or D790M.<br>
"Flexural Strength" (flexural modulus of rupture) is the maximum calculated stress in the outermost fibers of a test bar subjected to three-point loading at the moment of cracking or breaking. ASTM Test D 790 and D 790M are widely used for measuring this property For most plastics, flexural strength is usually substantially higher than the straight tensile strength.<br>
"Glass Transition" is a reversible change that occurs in an amorphous polymer or in amorphous regions of a partly crystalline polymer when it is heated from a very low temperature into a certain range, peculiar to each polymer, characterized by a rather sudden change from a hard, glassy, or brittle condition to a flexible or elastomeric<br>
condition. Physical properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion, specific heat, and density, usually undergo changes in their temperature derivatives at the same time During the transition, the molecular chains, normally coiled, tangled, and motionless at the lower temperatures, become free to rotate and slip past each other.<br>
"Glass Transition Temperature" (Tg) is the approximate midpoint of the temperature range over which the glass transition occurs. Tg is not obvious (like a melting point), and is detected by changes, with rising temperature, in secondary properties such as the rate of change with temperature of specific volume or electrical or mechanical properties Moreover, the observed Tg can vary significantly with the specific property chosen for observation and on experimental details such as the rate of heating or electrical frequency A reported Tg should therefore be viewed as an estimate The most reliable estimates are normally obtained from the loss peak in dynamic-mechanical tests or from dilatometric data. For purposes of the present invention, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is determined by the maximum point of the tan delta curve Tg can also be determined by the inflection of the DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) trace (ASTM Test D3148).<br>
"Melting Temperature" (hereafter identified by its symbol "Tm") is the temperature at which the thermal energy in a solid material is sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction in the crystalline lattice so that the lattice breaks down and the material becomes a liquid, i.e. it melts. According to the present invention the Tm is measured according to ASTM test D3148.<br>
"Melt Viscosity" is the resistance to shear in a molten resin, quantified as the quotient of shear stress divided by shear rate at any point in the flowing material. Elongational viscosity, which comes into play in the drawing of extrudates, is analogously defined In polymers, the viscosity depends not only on temperature and, less strongly, on pressure, but also on the level of shear stress (or shear rate). For purposes of the present invention melt viscosity is determined at 380°C as measured by capillary rheology according to ASTM D3835.<br>
"Moisture Absorption" is the pickup of water vapor by a material upon exposure for a definite time interval in an atmosphere of specified humidity and temperature. No ASTM test exists for this property. Moisture absorption at 50% relative humidity and by immersion in water is measured by weight gain.<br>
"Tensile Modulus" or "Modulus of Elasticity" is the ratio of nominal tensile stress to the corresponding elongation below the proportional limit of the material. The relevant ASTM test is D638.<br>
"Tensile Strength" is the maximum nominal stress sustained by a test specimen being pulled from both ends, at a specified temperature and at a specified rate of stretching. When the maximum nominal stress occurs at the Yield Point it shall be designated tensile strength at yield. When it occurs at break, it shall be designated tensile strength at break. The ASTM test for plastics is D638 (metric, D638M). The SI unit of tensile strength is the pascal (N/m2).<br>
"Organoclay" refers to a nanosilicate (also known as a nanoclay) that has undergone ion exchange to replace metal ions with organic cations. Organoclays as used herein is inclusive of the terms modified organically modified nanoclay, modified nanoclay, modified clay, modified silicate, modified nanosilicate, nanocomposite, and modified nanoflller.<br>
"Modifier" refers to organic cations, including polymer organic cations, that can ion exchange with the metal ions of a nanoclay to form an organoclay.<br>
Gallery spacing or d-spacing is the distance between the various microplates that make up a nanoclay or organoclay. The changes in the gallery spacing appear to be dependent on the composition of the organoclay and the solvent.<br>
"Intercalate" refers to a process by which the d-spacing is increased by the incorporation of a modifier, solvent, or a polymer between the plates. A modified nano clay has a d-spacing that is greater than that for the same unmodified nano clay.<br>
"Exfoliate" refers to the complete separation of the plates that make up the clay structure Sometimes there is incomplete exfoliation to smaller structures that have multiple plates that are called tactoids.<br>
"Polyamic acid solution'" (also known as poly-amide-acid, poly(amic acid), amic acid,<br>
polyamicacid, poly(amide acid), poly(amide-acid), or polyamic-acid) is a solution<br>
containing amic acid units that have the capability of reacting with surrounding<br>
organic moieties to form imide groups	<br>
"Polyimide" as used herein refers to polymers comprising repeating imide functional groups, and optionally additional ftinctional groups such as amides and/or ethers. "Polyimide" accordingly includes within its scope polyamide imides and poiyetherimides.<br>
The term "inerted" means that the atmosphere in a container is replaced with an inert gas, such as nitrogen.<br>
"Recycle" means that all or a part of the polymer according to the present invention can be re-used for the original utility for which the polymer was made. For example, if the original use of the polymer as a solvent cast film for a flexible circuit board, all or part of the polymer can be recycled and be re-dissolved in solvent with or without the use of additional monomer or polymer. Recycle can also mean that the polymer can be re-used either in part or completely by another reprocessing method into another utility such as an injected molded part.<br>
When structural units of chemical moieties are said to be formally derived from a precursor moiety herein, there is no implied limitation on the actual chemical reaction that may be used to produce the chemical moiety. For example when a chemical moiety such as a polyetherimide is said to have structural units formally derived from a dianhydride and a diamine, then any known method could be used to prepare the polyetherimide, including reaction of a dianhydride and a diamine, or a displacement reaction between a phenoxide species and an imide bearing a displaceable group, or other known method, it only being necessary that the chemical moiety comprise siructural units which may be represented in the stated precursor moiety. In one<br>
embodiment, the polymer is a polyimide formed by the polymerization of a dianhydride component and a diamine component and has a Tg of between about 180°C and 450°C. One article derived from the polymer-organoclay composites is a solvent cast film having, a) a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C; b) a thickness of between about 0.1 micrometers and 1000 micrometers; and, c) contains less than 5% residual solvent.<br>
The present invention is directed to articles comprising solvent cast films comprising a dianhydride component and a diamine component and a Tg of between 180°C and 450°C, specifically 190°C or greater, and wherein the film has: a) a CTE of less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C; b) a thickness of between 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers, e g, 5 to 250 micrometers, and, c) contains less than 5% residual solvent by weight.<br>
The solvent cast film according to the present invention can be made of at least one polyimide have a Tg of between 180°C and 450°C. In another embodiment, the polyimide has a Tg of 190°C or greater, specifically 190°C to 500°C, more specifically 190°C to 400°C. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the Tg of any particular polyimide can vary widely depending upon factors including the choice of dianhydride monomer, the number of different dianhydride monomers (sfructures as opposed to units), the choice of diamine monomer, the number of different diamine monomers (structures as opposed to units), processing conditions during production of the film, type of imidization process used to cure the polymer, etc. The skilled artisan will appreciate the ability to create a polymer having a desired Tg anywhere within the aforementioned range of Tg's, depending on the monomers used, the structure and/or use of endcapping, etc.<br>
The type of polyimide making up the film is similarly variable. The present invention specifically includes random and block polymers and co-polymers in all combinations of the one or more dianhydride and the one or more diamine from which the present polyimides can be made. More than one type of polyimide can be present, for example a combination of a polyamideimide and a polyetherimide, or two different kinds of polyetherimide. Also, the present invention is directed to solvent cast films<br>
comprising one or more polyimide films that includes other polymers selected from the group consisting of amorphous thermoplastic polymers including PPSU (polyphenylene sulfone), PSU (polysulfone), PC (polycarbonate), PPO (polyphenylene ether), PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer), PS (polystyrene), PVC (polyvinylchloride), crystalline thermoplastic resins including PFA (perfluoroalkoxyalkane), MFA (co-polymer of TFE (tetrafluoroethylene) and PFVE (perfluorinated vinyl ether)), FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene polymers), PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PEK (polyether ketone), PEEK (polyether-ether ketone), ECTFE (ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer), PVDF(polyvinylidene fluoride), PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), POM (polyacetal), PA (polyamide), UHMW-PE (ultra high molecular weight polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), HDPE (high density polyethylene), LDPE (low density polyethylene), and advanced engineering resins such as PBI (polybenzimidazole), poly(ether sulfone), poly(aryl sulfone), polyphenylene ethers, polybenzoxazoles, and polybenzothiazoles, as well as blends and co-polymers thereof<br>
Measured CTE's of the films may be an inherent property of the material by virtue of the materials chemical make-up. Alternatively, the CTE may be significantly lower than the inherent CTE of the film material through the use of additives and or by the performance of additional processing steps The CTE of the solvent cast film can be any CTE which is below 70 ppra/°C, specifically below 60 ppm/°C, and allows the film to function in its intended utility. For example, for a flexible circuit board the CTE can be close enough to that of the adjacent metallic conductive layer that the film is capable of serving its intended utility as a dielectric substrate, a layer in a laminate and/or a covering for a flexible circuit board In separate embodiments, the CTE is less than 70 ppra/°C, less than 50 ppm/°C, less than 40 ppm/°C, less than 35 ppra/°C, less than 30 ppm/°C, or less than 20 ppm/°C. According to other embodiments, the film has a CTE of at least 5 ppm/°C. The film can also have a CTE of 5 ppm/°C to 60 ppm/°C, and more specifically the coefficient of thermal expansion is 10 ppm/°C to 30 ppm/°C, and even more specifically 10 ppm/°C to 20 ppm/°C.<br>
Alternatively, the CTE of the film is adjusted to match a substrate material on which it is disposed. In one embodiment, the film has a CTE that is within ±20 ppm/°C of the CTE of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, a glass, a ceramic, or a polymer, specifically within ±20 ppm/°C of the CTE of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, or nickel. In another embodiment, the film has a CTE that is withm ±15 ppm/°C of the coefficient of thermal expansion of copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, or nickel, specifically copper.<br>
In an advantageous feature, it has been found that the CTE of the films is very stable. For example, the film after lamination to a substrate at a temperature from 250 to 450°C has a CTE within ±10 ppm/°C of the CTE of the film prior to lamination.<br>
The thickness of the films can vary widely depending upon the end use application, the method of making the film, the solids contents of the casting solution, to name a few of the subject parameters. The thickness may vary fi-om 0.1 micrometers up to 10,000 micrometers, or more particularly fi-om 5 micrometers up to 1,000 micrometers, however it is expected that for use in flexible circuit boards the most likely thickness will be between 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers.<br>
The final solvent cast film may contain residual solvent and still be capable of fiinctioning for its intended purpose. The minimum amount of residual solvent will be the most residual solvent content under which the film will still function for its intended utility. One the other hand, the solvent cast films may also contain as low a residual solvent content as is possible to achieve. For example, solvent is expensive and can be an environmental hazard. Both a cost savings and an improvement of environmental conditions may be achieved by minimizing the amounts of solvent contained in final product. The residual solvent content will be less than 5% of the total weight of the film. In another embodiment, the amount of residual solvent will be less than 1% of the total weight of the film.<br>
Solvents that can be used in the process include any solvent with which a solvent cast film may be made. The solvent can be a good solvent for polyimides, by for example, having a relatively high boiling to facilitate solution film formation or direct<br><br>
devolatization via extrusion. The solvent for film formation can be the same that is used to make the polyamic acid solution described below Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP), trichloroethane, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methylpyrohdinone (NMP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane, tetrahydroftiran (THF), benzophenone, cyclohexanone, phenol, mixtures of o-, p- and m- cresols, mixtures of cresylic with phenol, ethylphenols, isopropylphenols, tert-butylphenols, xylenols, mesitols, chlorophenols, dichlorophenpls, ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), phenylphenols, a monoalkyl ether of ethylene glycol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoalkyl ether of diethylene glycol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoaryl ether glycol, a monoaryl ether of propylene glycol, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetramethylurea, phenoxy ethanol, propylene glycol phenyl ether, anisole, veratrole, o-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, pyridine, N-cyclohexylpyrrolidinone, ethyl lactate, an ionic liquid, and mixtures containing one or more of these solvents. Ionic liquids generally include salts having a meltmg point that is relatively low (below 100°C). Examples of ionic liquids include, but and are not limited to ammonium, imidazolium-, phosphonium-, pyridinmm-, pyrrolidinmm-, and sulfonium-based salts. Counter-ions in such liquids can include, but are not be limited to the following, bromides, chlorides, tetrafluoroborates, acetates, phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, methane sulfates, nitrates, thiocyanates, and combinations thereof<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the specific solvent used is dependent on any number of factors including, for example, the solubility of the polyimide and the precursor monomers in a solvent, and the volatility of the solvent, for example.<br>
Solvent cast films according to the present invention may be made by any method known in the art. The following patents assigned to GE disclose generic methods of making solvent cast films and casting solutions: 4,115,341; 4,157,996; 4,307,226; 4,360,633, 4,374,972; and, 3,847,867. One manufacturing process can involve the following steps: forming a polyamic acid solution comprising a monomer component comprising one or more dianhydrides and one or more organic diamines at least<br>
partially dissolved in a solvent system; casting the polyamic acid solution onto a substrate such that the polyamic acid solution takes on a form having a length, width and depth on the surface of the substrate; removing the solvent, and curing the polyamic acid solution to form a film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C, and a thickness of from 0.1 micrometers to 250 micrometers, specifically 5 to 250 micrometers.<br>
Alternately, the method can comprise making a solvent cast film comprising: preparing a casting solution comprising a polyamic acid solution made up of a monomer component and a solvent component; casting a film of the casting solution on a support base; removing solvent from the cast film for a predetermined period of time to form a solvent cast film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, specifically less than 60 ppm/°C and a thickness of between 0.1 micrometers and 250 micrometers, specifically between 5 and 250 micrometers; and conducting an additional process step on the solvent cast film to reduce the CTE of the film below 30 ppra/°C.<br>
The polyamic acid solution may be prepared by mixing one or more dianhydride(s), water, and solvent as by stirring until the one or more dianhydride component is dissolved. Then the one or more monomeric diamine can be added and the solution stirred until the amines dissolve. The components that make up the dianhydride component and the diamine component may include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more different dianhydrides and diamines The scope of the present invention is specifically intended to include all permutations, and combinations of the number and variety of dianhydride and diamine monomers. For example, in one embodiment, the polyamic acid solution will be made up of two different dianhydrides and two different diamines. In another embodiment, one of the one or more dianhydrides is ODPA.<br>
In general, the organic amine component may be included in an amount of from 0.5 mole to 2.0 moles, or, more particularly, from 1 to 1.3 moles, per mole of dianhydride component. Where more than one compound is included in a component of the present solution, the parts, moles, or other quantity of such component is taken as the sum of the parts, moles, or such other quantity, respectively, of each compound included in such component. Thus, for example, total amine content is calculated by<br>
adding the equivalent amounts of each diamine in the amine component e.g., 2(number of moles of f' diamine) + 2(number of moles of 2"' diamine) = total equivalents of amine<br>
Total anhydride content is calculated m a similar fashion. A slight excess of amine is can be used to impart additional film flexibility or possible cross-linking. It has been found that polyimide enamel can have from 5 to 500 repeating dianhydride-diamine reaction product units and preferably from 10 to 200. Terminal amino and phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride or various suitable end groups can also be present<br>
Experience has shown that sufficient solvent should be utilized to provide a solids content to provide a solution with a workable viscosity for stirring and handling. In one embodiment, the solids content will be from 1-65% by weight. In other embodiments the solids content will be from 1-40%, 1-25%, 1-15%, or 1-12.5% by weight<br>
Solutions having high ratios of monomeric reactants to organic solvent component advantageously minimize the amount of organic solvent released during subsequent formation and cure of polyetherimide resins as in the manufacture of solvent cast film. Such solutions having high amounts of monomeric reactants may have higher viscosities than desired for some solvent cast films. Typically, inclusion of water decreases the solution viscosity. A given decrease in viscosity may be effected using a lower amount of added water relative to the amount of added organic solvent component which would be required to effect the same viscosity decrease.<br>
Water may or may not be a part of the polyamic acid solution. Water may be present in any amount up to the maximum amount at which the solution is substantially free of precipitate. Although water is miscible with the organic solvent component in substantially all proportions, inclusion of too much water in the present monomeric solution results in precipitate or other plural phase formation. The amount of water which may be present depends on the particular dianhydride and diamine components, the particular organic solvent component, and the weight ratio of monomeric reactants to organic solvent.<br>
Advantageously, the present polyamic acid solutions may include the monomeric reactants in a combmed amount of 40 or more weight percent, e.g. from 40 to 75 or more weight percent, based on the weight of the solution. In general, such high monomer content solutions, mcluding water as may be required, have suitable viscosities m the temperature range, e.g., 15°C to 200°C, normally used to make solvent cast films<br>
Solutions including water are more easily prepared by adding the monomeric reactant components with stirring to a solution of the water and organic solvent component. Preparation of the solution is generally accelerated at elevated temperatures.<br>
An additive can present in the polyimide fihns, for example by adding to the polyamic acid solutions m order to reduce the CTE below the CTE that the material would have without the additive. These additives include those that will aid in lowering the CTE of the solvent cast film, and those that can aid in producing another desirable property in the present films. These ingredients may be used in any amount to impart the desired property at proportions of from 0.001 to 60 parts of additive, per 100 parts by weight of polyimide. Alternatively these additives may be added in amounts from 0,01 to 30 parts of additive, and more particularly from O.I to 10 parts of additive per 100 parts by weight of polyimide<br>
The types of additives which can be employed to lower the CTE of a solvent cast polyimide film include modified nano-composite silicates (nanoclays). Suitable nanoclays include kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, halloysite, antigonte, chrysotile, pyrophyllite, montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, saponite, sauconite, stevensite, hectorite, tetrasilylic mica, sodium taeniolite, muscovite, margarite, talc, vermiculite, phlogopite, xanthophyllite, chlorite, synthetic silicates, and a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing nanoclays.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the present disclosure describes methods of forming nanoclay composites, in particular polymer-organoclay composites, and articles, such as films, comprising the polymer-organoclay composites.   The polymer-organoclay<br>
composites can be formed into films by solution casting. Such organoclays can be thermally stable at film forming processing temperatures<br>
Different polymers can be used to form the polymer-organoclay composites, including thermoset and thermoplastic polymers. Exemplary polymers include those described above, specifically polyvinylchlorides, polyolefms, polyesters (including aromatic polyesters), polyamides, polysulfones, polyimides, (including polyamide imides and polyetherimides), polyether sulfone, polyphenylene sulfides, polyether ketones, polyether ether ketones, ABS, polystyrenes, polybutadienes, polyacrylates, polyalkylacrylates, polyacrylonitriles, polyacetals, polycarbonates, polyphenylene ethers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinyl acetates, liquid crystalline polymers, ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymers, polyvinyl fluorides, polyvinylidene fluorides, polyvinylidene chlorides, polytetrafluoroethylene, and a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing polymers. A specific polymer is a polyimide.<br>
The polymer-organoclay composites further comprise an organoclay. Organoclays are organically modified nanoclays having a plurality of inorganic silicate layers generally alternating with organic layers. Organoclays can be prepared by ion exchange of metal cations in a nanoclay with organic cations. For example, the sodium ions in montmorillonite nanoclays can be exchanged with an organic cation such as a tetrahydrocarbylammonium or tetrahydrocarbylphosphonium cations. Ion exchange is generally carried out by known methods in water, or a combination of water and a water-miscible organic solvent.<br>
In one embodiment the organic cation is a quaternary organic cation, for example an ammonium or phosphonium ion of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Q is nitrogen or phosphorous; and R7, R8, R9 and R10 are each independently a C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, a C2-C20 aromatic radical,<br>
or a polymer chain. The foregoing radicals can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example with a C1-C20 hydrocarbon and/or one or more functional groups, for example hydroxy!, sulfliydryl, nitro, cyano, halogen, carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid ester, carbonyl, amide, imide, and anhydride.<br>
In another embodiment the organic cation is a quaternary phosphonium cation of formula (2)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ar1, Ar2, Ar3 and Ar4 are each independently C6-C50 aromatic radicals; "a" is a number from 1 to about 200; "c" is a number from 0 to 3; R1 is independently at each occurrence a halogen atom, a C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, or a C2-C20 aromatic radical; and R2 is a C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, a C2-C50 aromatic radical, or a polymer chain.<br>
The organic cation can be a quaternary phosphonium cation of the formula (3)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ar12, Ar13 Ar14and Ar15 are independently Ce-Cso aromatic radicals; and Ar16 is a C2-C200 aromatic radical, or a polymer chain comprising at least one aromatic group.<br>
Exemplary quaternary ammonium cations include a pyridinium cation of formula (4)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ar6, Ar7, and Ar8 are independently C6-C50 aromatic radicals; "b" is a number from 0 to 2, R3 is independently at each occurrence a halogen atom, a C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, or a C6-C20 aromatic radical; and Ar is a C6-C200 aromatic radical, or a polymer chain comprising at least one aromatic group. A specific example of this type of cation is of formula (5)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ar6, Ar7, and Ar8 are independently C2-C50 aromatic radicals, "b" is a number from 0 to 2; "d" is a number from 0 to 4; R3 and R4 are independently at each occurrence a halogen atom, a C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, or a C2-C20 aromatic radical; Z is a bond, a divalent C1-C20 aliphatic radical, a divalent C5-C20 cycloaliphatic radical, a divalent C2-C20 aromatic radical, an oxygen linking group, a sulfur linkmg group, a SO2 linking group, or a Se linking group; and Ar9 is a C10-C200 aromatic radical, or a polymer chain comprising at least one aromatic group.<br>
After ion exchange, the spacing between the inorganic silicate layers (the "d-spacing") is greater than 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, or 75 Angstroms. The organoclays are then exfoliated to produce the polymer-organoclay composites. Exfoliation occurs when the organoclays are exposed to an energized condition of a sufficient intensity and duration, and results in an increase in the spacing between the inorganic silicate layers (the "d-spacing"). The d-spacing in the exfoliated organoclay can be any distance that is greater than the initial d-spacing, that is, the d-spacing in the non-exfoliated organoclay. In one embodiment, the d-spacing is sufficient to effectively provide a polymer-organoclay composite that will lower the CTE of a polyimide film. In some embodiments, the exfoliated organoclays have in increase in the initial d-<br>
spacings of from 5 to 90 Angstroms, in particular greater than 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, or 75 Angstroms. In other embodiments, after the increase, the d-spacing in the exfoliated organoclay is random. When the increase m d-spacing results in a random distribution, the sheets are oriented in such a way that the d-spacing is no longer measurable. In still other embodiments, the net increase in the initial d-spacing of the organoclay is from about 10 to about 500 percent.<br>
One method of exfoliation is sonication. Exfoliation can also be accomplished by high-energy mixing Both sonication and high-energy mixing are carried out in a solvent system, for example in a system comprising from 1 to 90 wt.% of the organoclay and from 10 to 99 wt.% of the solvent system, specifically 1 to 50 wt.% of the organoclay and from 50 to 99 wt.% of the solvent system, more specifically 1 to 15 wt.% of the organoclay and from 85 to 99 wt.% of the solvent system.<br>
Suitable solvent systems allow good dispersal of the organoclay, effective exfoliation, and also dissolve the polymer or polymer precursor as described below Suitable solvents include N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrolidinone, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, tefraliydrofuran, benzophenone, cyclohexanone, phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, m-cresol, phenol, ethylphenol, isopropylphenol, t-butylphenol, xylenol, mesitol, chlorophenol, dichlorophenol, phenylphenol, a monoalkyl ether of ethylene glycol having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoalkyl ether of diethylene glycol having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a monoaryl ether glycol, a monoaryl ether of propylene glycol, tetramethylurea, phenoxy ethanol, propylene glycol phenyl ether, anisole, veratrole, o-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, pyridine, N-cyclohexylpyrrolidinone, ethyl lactate, an ionic liquid, and a combination thereof<br>
In one embodiment, a first mixture is formed by combining (e.g., homogenizing) the organoclay in the selected solvent system, followed by exfoliation, i.e., exposing the first mixture to an energized condition to form a second mixture The energized condition is under sufficient intensity and duration to increase the initial spacing of the inorganic silicate layers, e.g., sonication.   Exemplary sonicators are ulfrasonic<br>
liquid processors available from Misonix, Inc., constant frequency SONOPUSH MONO HD® ultrasonic transducers by Weber Ultrasonics, and tubular submersible transducers sold by MPI. Sonication can be performed in either a batch or continuous process. In the batch process, the homogenized first mixture is placed in contact with the sonic source The mixture is stirred well to ensure uniform sonication of the entire mixture. In the continuous process, the first mixture is flowed through the sonic zone at a given rate. The mixture is stirred well to ensure a uniform dispersion of the nanosilicate In either the batch or continuous process, the sonication conditions required for exfoliation (i.e., flow rate, sonication power, sonication time) depends on the type of modifier used, solvent, batch size, configuration and size of the sonic source, and temperature at which sonication takes place. The artisan will appreciate that other equipment and methods can be used to impart energized conditions. In another embodiment, for instance, a SILVERSON™ mixer can be used. Depending on the specific need at hand, different models can be used. Any other functionally equivalent shearer/mixer grinder can be used.<br>
Intercalation and exfoliation of the organoclays can be observed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the resulting solution. Exfoliation can also be observed by combining the sonicated organoclay mixture with a polymer, removing the solvent, e.g, by evaporation, precipitation or via a devolatizing extruder, and then casting or pressing a film, and performing TEM analysis.<br>
Exfoliation can be performed before combination with the polymer, after combination with the polymer, before combination with a polymer precursor, or after combination with a polymer precursor In other words, the polymer or polymer precursor can be added to the first mixture (the solvent and the unexfoliated nanoclay) or to the second mixture (the solvent and the exfoliated nanoclay).<br>
Thus, in a specific embodiment, exfoliation is performed after combination of the unexfoliated nanoclay with a polymer such as a polyimide. In another specific embodiment, exfoliation is performed before combination with a polyimide. In this embodiment, a third mixture is formed by combining the exfoliated nanoclay with the polyimide (or other polymer). The polyimide (or other polymer) can be pre-dissolved<br>
in a solvent (e.g., DMAc or NMP) or added directly to the mixture containing the exfoliated organoclay to provide a solids content in the range of 5 to 25 wt %. The polyimide (or other polymer) is at least partially soluble in the solvent, and further separates the silicate layers in the organoclay. The solvent is then at least partially removed from the third mixture.<br>
Alternatively, exfoliation occurs before combination with a polyamic acid solution (or other polymer precursor) to provide a second mixture having, for example, a solids content from 5 to 25% solids by weight. The polyamic acid solution is then polymerized as described above. In one embodiment, polymerization occurs during removal of the solvent from the exfoliated nanoclay and polyamic acid combination. The thus-formed polyimide is at least partially soluble in the solvent, and further separates the silicate layers in the organoclay. The solvent can then be continued to be removed from the polyimide-organoclay composite. The silicate layers of the organoclay remain separated after solvent removal.<br>
In still another embodiment, a polymer precursor is combined with the unexfoliated organoclay in the solvent system prior to exposing the mixture to an energizing condition. The polymer precursor can be at least partially polymerized before exfoliation, during exfoliation, and/or after exfoliation to provide the polymer The thus-formed polymer is at least partially soluble in the solvent, and further separates the silicate layers in the organoclay. The solvent is then at least partially removed to provide the polymer-organoclay composite composition. For example, a dianhydride component and an organic diamine component is combined with the organoclay m the solvent system (for example, DMAc), to provide a mixture having a solids content of, e g., 2 to 15 wt.% solids, or more particularly, 1 to 5 wt.% solids. The organoclay and monomers are sonicated to increase the initial d-spacing of the organoclay. The exfoliated organoclay and monomer mixture is then heated to form a polyamic acid. The thus-formed polyamic acid is at least partially soluble in the solvent. The solvent is then at least partially removed from the second mixture, converting the polyamic acid to the polyimide. It has been found that polymerization of a diamine and dianhydride in the presence of the organoclays results in good dispersion of the organoclays.<br>
In still another embodiment, the organoclay is exfoliated before being combined with a dianhydride component and an organic diamine component in the solvent system (for example, DMAc), to provide a mixture having a solids content of, e.g., 2 to 15 wt.% solids, or more particularly, 1 to 5 wt.% solids. The dianhydride and organic diamine are then polymerized to provide a polyamic acid, and then a polyimide The thus-formed polyimide is at least partially soluble in the solvent, and further separates the silicate layers in the organoclay. The solvent is then at least partially removed from the polyamic acid or polyimide mixture. The silicate layers of the organoclay remain separated after solvent removal.<br>
Removal of the solvent in any of the foregoing embodiments can be by devolatization or precipitation into nonsolvent. Exfoliation is maintained after removal of the solvent The resulting polymer-organoclay compositions can be formed into films via solution casting or melt extrusion<br>
It has been found that use of organoclays, particularly exfoliated organoclays, provides unexpected advantages. Fikns comprising an organoclay can have a lower CTE than a film of the same composition without the organoclay. Alternatively, or in addition, films comprising an organoclay can have a Tg that is the same as a film of the same composition without the organoclay. A film comprising an organoclay can also be transparent. The amount of organoclay used in the film will vary, depending on the desired film properties. For example, the film can comprise from 0 1 to 10 wt.% of the organoclay, specifically from 1 to 10 wt.% of the organoclay, based on the total weight of the film.<br>
The monomers, at least one dianhydride monomer and at least one diamine monomer, are added to the clay dispersion to form a modified polyamic acid solution. Also, instead of adding polyamic acid to the clay dispersion, in another embodiment, a 10 wt% solution of the dried film in dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrolidinone has an inherent viscosity of greater than 0.05 dl/g. The polyimide solution can then be combined with the clay dispersion and cast as above<br>
Another type of additives that can be used to lower the CTE of a solvent cast polyimide film includes soluble nano-particle precursors such as aluminum (acetylacetonoate)3.<br>
Another additive that can be employed to lower the CTE of solvent cast polyimide<br>
films are metal oxide nanoparticles, which can be formed irom an organo-metallic<br>
precursor. Metal oxide nanoparticles can be generated in situ by decomposing an<br>
organometallic     precursor.	One     example     of     such     a     material     is<br>
aluminum(acetylacetonate)3 (Al(acac)3). Thermolysis of (Al(acac)3) yields aluminum oxide. When done in dilute solution (small molecule solvent or polymer melt) AI2O3 nanoparticles are formed. Targeting a 1% by weight loading of AI2O3 in the final polymer, the precursor can be added upfront to the polymerization of dianhydride and diamine monomers, specifically oxydiphthalic anhydride and diaminodiphenylsulfone. Resultant polymer filled with AI2O3 nanoparticles exhibited a CTE lowered by more than 15% compared to an unfilled control sample.<br>
In addition to the organo-metallic precursor being added to the polymerization, the precursor can be solvent blended with the polyamic acid solution, or finished soluble polyimide, or blended and extruded with finished polymer to yield a filled system. The materials in solution can be cast as films and cured to give the filled film. Other suitable organo-metallic precursors include metal(acac) complexes, and ceramic precursors such as molybdenum sulfide.<br>
Other classes of additives which can be used to impart a desirable property other than, or in addition to lowering the CTE of a polyimide film, include fillers and reinforcements for example fiber glass, milled glass, glass beads, flake and the like. Minerals such as talc, woUastonite, mica, kaolin, or montmorillonite clay, silica, filmed silica, perlite, quartz, and barite may be added. The compositions can also be modified with effective amounts of inorganic fillers, such as, for example, carbon fibers and nanotubes, glass fibers, metal fibers, metal powders, conductive carbon, and other additives including nano-scale reinforcements<br>
In some cases a metal oxide may be added to the polymers of the present invention In some instances the metal oxide may fiirther improve flame resistance (FR) performance by decreasing heat release and increasing the time to peak heat release. Titanium dioxide is of note. Other metal oxides include zinc oxides, boron oxides, antimony oxides, iron oxides, and transition metal oxides. Metal oxides that are white may be desired in some instances. Metal oxides may be used alone or in combmation with other metal oxides. Metal oxides may be used in any effective amount, in some instances at from 0.01 to 20% by weight of the polymer.<br>
Other useful additives include smoke suppressants such as metal borate salts, for example zinc borate, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borate or other borate sahs. Additionally other boron containing compounds, such as boric acid, borate esters, boron oxides, or other oxygen compounds of boron may be useful. Additionally other flame retardant additives, such as aryl phosphates and brominated aromatic compounds, including polymers containing linkages made from brominated aryl compounds, may be employed. Examples of halogenated aromatic compounds are brominated phenoxy resins, halogenated polystyrenes, halogenated imides, brominated polycarbonates, brominated epoxy resins and mixtures thereof<br>
In some instances it maybe desired to have flame retardant compositions that are essentially free of halogen atoms, especially bromine and chlorine. Essentially free of halogen atoms means that in some embodiments the composition has less than 3% halogen, specifically chlorine and/or bromine by weight of the composition, and in other embodiments less than 1% by weight of the composition contains halogen atoms, specifically chlorine and/or bromine. The amount of halogen atoms can be determined by ordinary chemical analysis.<br>
The composition may also optionally include a fluoropolymer in an amount of 0.01 to 5.0 % fluoropolymer by weight of the composition The fluoropolymer may be used in any effective amount to provide anti-drip properties to the resin composition Some examples of suitable fluoropolymers and methods for making such fluoropolymers are set forth, for example, in US Patent Nos. 3,671,487, 3,723,373 and 3,383,092.    Suitable fluoropolymers include homopolymers and copolymers that<br>
comprise structural units derived from one or more fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers. The term "fluorinated alpha-olefin monomer" means an alpha-olefin monomer that includes at least one fluorine atom substituent. Some of the suitable fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers include, for example, fluoroethylenes such as, for example, CF2=CF2, CHF=CF2, CH2=CF2, and CH2=CHF and fluoro propylenes such as, for example, CF3CF=CF2, CF3CF=CHF, CF3CH=CF2, CFjCH°CHz, CF3CF=CHF, CHF2CH=CHF, and CF3CF=CH2.<br>
Some of the suitable fluorinated alpha-olefin copolymers include copolymers comprising structural units derived from two or more fluorinated alpha-olefin monomers such as, for example, poly(tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro ethylene), and copolymers comprising structural units derived from one or more fluorinated monomers and one or more non-fluorinated monoethylenically unsaturated monomers that are copolymerizable with the fluorinated monomers such as, for example, poly(tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene-propylene) copolymers. Suitable non-fluorinated monoethylenically unsaturated monomers include for example, alpha-olefin monomers such as, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, acrylate monomers such as for example, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, and the like, with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) homopolymer (PTFE) preferred.<br>
Other additives which may be added to the solvent cast fihns include antioxidants such as phosphites, phosphonites, and hindered phenols. Phosphorus containing stabilizers, including triaryl phosphite and aryl phosphonates, are of note as useful additives Difunctional phosphorus containing compounds can also be employed. Stabilizers with a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 300 Daltons are preferred. In other instances phosphorus containing stabilizers with a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500 Daltons are usefijl. Phosphorus containing stabilizers are typically present in the composition at 0.05-0.5% by weight of the formulation. Colorants as well as light stabilizers and UV absorbers may also be used. Flow aids and mold release compounds are also contemplated. Examples of mold release agents are alkyl carboxylic acid esters, for example, pentaerythritol tetrastearate, glycerin tri-stearate, and ethylene glycol distearate. Mold release agents and processing aids are typically present in the composition at 0.05-0.5% by weight of<br>
the formulation. Preferred mold release agents will have high molecular weight, typically greater than 300 Daltons, to prevent loss if the release agent from the molten polymer mixture during melt processing.<br>
Compositions used to form the articles according to the present invention may also include various additives such as nucleating, clarifying, stiffiiess, and/or crystallization rate agents. These agents are used in a conventional matter and in conventional amounts.<br>
The compositions can be blended with the aforementioned ingredients by a variety of methods involving intimate admixing of the materials with any additional additives desired in the formulation. A preferred procedure includes solution blending, although melt blending may be employed after the solvent cast film is made Illustrative examples of equipment used in such melt processing methods include co-rotating and counter-rotating extruders, single screw extruders, co-kneaders, disc-pack processors, and various other types of extrusion equipment<br>
Liquid coating solutions can be formed using the above-described polyimide compositions, as well as film-forming solutions. The liquid coating solutions have many and varied uses. The coating solutions can be applied to a variety of substrates using any suitable coatmg method, e.g. dipping, brushing, spraying, wipmg and the like, and thereafter heated to evaporate the solvent system and form cured polyetherimide resmous coatings. The temperature is preferably increased gradually to produce smooth resinous coatings. The polymerization and cure proceeds advantageously at a temperature of fi'om 125°C to 300°C or more<br>
The polyamic acid solution can also be used as a coating solution which may be applied immediately upon preparation or stored prior to use. In general, maximum storage life can be obtained by storing the solutions under a nitrogen blanket in the absence of light.<br>
Polymers used to make the solvent cast films and coatings are polyimides and in some specific instances, polyetherimides Polyimides according to the present invention have the general formula (6).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein a is more than 1, typically 10 to 1,000 or more, or more specifically 10 to 500; and wherein V is a tetravalent linker without limitation, as long as the linker does not impede synthesis or use of the polyimide.

Included among the many methods of making the polyimides, particularly polyetherimides, are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,847,867, 3,850,885, 3,852,242, 3,855,178, 3,983,093, and 4,443,591.<br>
The reactions can be carried out employing solvents, e.g., o-dichlorobenzene, m-cresol/toluene and the like, to effect a reaction between the anhydride of formula (10) and the diamine of formula (11), at temperatures of 100°C to 250°C. Chain stoppers and branching agents may also be employed in the reaction.<br>
When polyimide copolymers of ether-containmg and non-ether containing subunits are used, a dianhydride, such as pyromellitic anhydride, is used in combination with the bis(ether anhydride). The polyimides can optionally be prepared from reaction of an aromatic bis(ether anhydride) with an organic diamine in which the diamine is present in the reaction mixture at less than or equal to 0.2 molar excess. Under such conditions the polyetherimide resin may have less than or equal to 15 microequivalents per gram (neq/g) acid titratable groups, or, more specifically less than or equal to 10 microequivalents/g acid titratable groups, as shown by titration with chloroform solution with a solution of 33 weight percent (wt%) hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid. Acid-titratable groups are essentially due to amine end-groups in the polyetherimide resin.<br><br>
One route for the synthesis of polyimides proceeds through a bis(4-halophthalimide) having the following structure (14):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is as described above and X is a halogen.   The bis(4-halophthalimide) wherein R is a 1,3-phenyl group as shown in formula (15) is particularly useful.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
Polyethenmides may be synthesized by the reaction of the bis(halophthalimide) with an alkali metal salt of a bisphenol such as bisphenol A or a combination of an alkali metal salt of a bisphenol and an alkali metal salt of another dihydroxy substituted aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence or absence of phase transfer catalyst. Suitable phase transfer catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,229,482. Suitable dihydroxy substituted aromatic hydrocarbons include those having the formula (17)<br><br>

wherein A is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon radical.  Suitable A2 radicals include m-phenylene, p-phenylene, 4,4'-biphenylene, and similar radicals.<br>
As described above, virgin polyimides can be used in the formation of the solvent cast polyimide films However, in a specific embodiment, the polyimide films comprise up to 50 wt%, specifically up to 30 wt%, of a recycled polyimide, wherein prior to recycling the recycled polyimide film has a glass transition temperature from 210°C to 450°C. In one embodiment, virgin polyimide is melt blended with recycled polyimide, for example polyimide that has already been formed into a film. In another embodiment, virgin polyimide is solvent mixed with recycled polyimide, for example polyimide that has been formed into a film as described above. Polyimide compositions comprising the recycled polyimide can then be formed into a casting composition and be cast as described herein, for example from a composition comprising 1 to 30 wt% solids. In the foregoing embodiments, the CTE of the film comprising the recycled polyimide can be within +10 ppm/°C of a film having the same composition without the recycled polyimide.<br>
As an alternative to creating a solvent cast film having a CTE less than 70 ppm/°C, in another embodiment less than 60 ppm/°C, or in another embodiment, less than 35 pprn/°C, it is possible to add an additional process step to lower the CTE of a solvent cast film having a CTE above 70 ppm/°C, above 60 ppm/°C, or in another embodiment, above 35 ppm/°C, to a CTE below 60 ppm/°C and in another embodiment less than 35 ppm/°C, specifically less than 30 ppmL/°C.<br>
The CTE of a solvent cast film can be reduced by biaxially stretching as described in US Patent 5,460,890. Similarly, the CTE of a melt extruded film or fully imidized solvent cast film can be reduced by thermally biaxially stretching as described m US Patent No 5,260,407 The skilled artisan will be familiar with the other known methods of lowering the CTE of a polyimide film<br>
For example, a film with a low in-plane CTE may be obtained from polyknide resin compositions because the resin exhibits a partial crystallinity after annealing, and the crystalline phases can be aligned in two dimensions through biaxial stretching after extrusion. The film can then be heat set while constrained in a frame, returning the amorphous portion of the film back to a random unoriented configuration while retaining the alignment of the crystalline phases (and also inducing more aligned<br>
crystalline domains) The alignment of the crystalline phases results in a film with a low CTE Since the amorphous part of the material is returned to its random state the film will not exhibit shrinkage, even when taken above the Tg of the material. This can lead to a dimensionally stable film at flex fabrication temperatures, because the crystalline domains are stable to temperatures above 400°C. The film has high temperature survivability due to the high Tg of the material and the partial crystallimty. The Tg of the material is above the temperature of the solder float test, which makes the material survive this test as well. The polymer crystals do not melt until temperatures exceeding 400°C, which is well above the temperatures seen during flex fabrication. The crystals act as effective crosslinks below Tm, holding the material together for high temperature survivability. The crystallization kinetics of the composition identified below is fairly slow, allowing the material to be melt extruded to a film before significant crystallization takes place. The film can then be heat set above Tg to induce crystallinity.<br>
A wide range of polyetherimide copolymers containing a combination of the monomers 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), bisphenol A dianhydride (BPADA), meta-phenylenediamine (mPD), and para-phenylenediamine (pPD) exhibit the partial crystallinity and high heat necessary for the film to exhibit the desired properties. The polymer can be end capped with, for example, aniline. The scope of the present invention is specifically intended to encompass the monomers and endcaps necessary to have partial crystallinity and to maintain processability. A specific example can be 80-100% ODPA as the dianhydride and 30-100% pPD as the diamine, with 3.5-5% aniline as the endcapping agent.<br>
Varying these compositions can alter the crystallization kinetics to achieve the desired balance of processability and achievable crystallinity to reduce CTE. In one embodiment, the optimum composition in terms of processability, ductility, slow crystallization kinetics, and maximum achievable crystallinity is a dianhydride component comprising 95% ODPA and 5% BPADA, on an equivalents basis, and a diamine component comprising 70% mPD and 30% pPD on an equivalents basis, together with 5% aniline, based on the total equivalents of dianhydride component and diamine component.<br>
Very good film properties are obtained when a specific combination of dianhydrides are used, especially when the specific dianhydrides are used in combination with specific diamines. In one embodiment, the dianhydrides comprise 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthaIic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof Other, additional dianhydrides can be present to adjust the properties of the films In one embodiment, however, the polyimide has less than 15 molar % of structural units derived from a member of the group consisting of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, a dianhydride of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, an ester of biphenyltetracarboxylic acid, and combinations thereof<br>
Alternatively, the polyimides are formed from a dianhydride component that consists essentially of 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof In still another embodiment, the polyimides are formed from a dianhydride component that consists of 3,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 3,3'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, 4,4'-oxydiphthalic anhydride, and combinations thereof.<br>
It has further been found films having excellent properties are obtained when the diamine component comprises 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, l,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof In one embodiment, the diamine component consists essentially of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 1,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the diamine component consists of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, 4,4'-oxydianiline, l,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, l,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene, and combinations thereof, and no other diamines are present<br>
The polyimides are further advantageously formed from structural units wherein the diamine component comprises greater than or equal to 10 mole % of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, based on the total moles of diamine component. In one embodiment the diamine component comprises 10 to 100 mole % of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone<br>
The films can have a number of advantageous properties, in addition to low CTE, useful Tg, and low solvent retention. In one embodiment, the film is stable, that is, loses less than 5 % of its initial weight after storage in water for 24 hours at 25°C, specifically less than 2 % of its initial weight after storage in water for 24 hours at<br>
25°C.<br>
In an unexpected feature, it has been found by the inventors that the polyimides, in particular polyetherimides comprising units derived fi-om specific diamines, can be formulated to exhibit a relatively constant CTE while achieved a Tg from 220 to 375°C. This result is unexpected because ordinarily in thermoplastic amorphous films, CTE varies with Tg of m a linear relationship. It is therefore possible to select a desired Tg while maintainmg a specific CTE.<br>
The liquid coating solutions, film casting solutions, coatings, and solvent cast films of the present invention have many and varied uses. The coating solutions may be applied to a variety of substrates using any suitable coating method, e.g. dipping, brushing, spraying, wiping and the like, and thereafter heated to evaporate the solvent system and form cured polyimide resinous coatings and/or solvent cast films. The temperature is preferably increased gradually to produce smooth resinous coatings. The polyimide-forming reaction proceeds advantageously at a temperature of from 125°C to 450°C or more. A variety of substrates can be used, for example copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, a glass, a ceramic, and a polymer, including a polymeric release layer. A first and a second substrate having the same or different compositions can be disposed on opposite sides of the solvent cast polyimide film.<br>
In one embodiment, the coating and casting solutions are used to manufacture a laminate comprising the solvent cast polyimide film, a conductive layer comprising a metal, wherein a side of the film is adheringly disposed on a side of the conductive layer. The conductive metal can be copper, silver, gold, aluminum, or an alloy comprising at least one of the foregoing metals. In a specific embodunent, the metal is copper and wherein the solvent cast film has a coefficient of thermal expansion less than 35 ppm/°C.<br>
In another embodiment, the present coating and casting solutions may be employed to manufacture films for circuit boards, including flexible circuit boards. In this embodiment, a solvent cast polyimide film is adheringly disposed on an electrically conductive substrate, for example a face of a metal layer such as copper, wherein the metal is etched to provide a circuit. A second substrate, e.g., another layer of a conductive metal such as copper, silicon, aluminum, gold, silver, or nickel, can be disposed on a side of the film opposite the first substrate. The flexible printed circuit can further comprise a dielectric layer comprising a second dielectric material other than the polyimide of the film.<br>
Other specific articles that can be manufactured using the solvent cast polyimide films include capacitors, which in their simplest embodiment comprise a solvent cast polyimide film disposed between two electrically conductive layers, e.g., two copper layers.<br>
In still another embodiment, the solutions can be used as wire enamels to form resinous insulating coatings on copper and aluminum wire. In this embodiment, the polyimide film forms a coating on an electrically conductive wire that surrounds at least a portion of the radial surface of the wire<br>
The solutions can also be used as varnishes for coating or impregnating various substrates such as coils of previously insulated wire (e.g. in motor and generator coils), as well as woven and non-woven fabrics, and the like. The solvent cast films of the present invention may also be used for flexible printed circuit board (FPC), chip-on-flex (COF), and tape automated bonding (TAB) applications The term "articles" can also include speaker cones, tapes and labels, wire wraps, etc.<br>

DMA: Film samples cut precisely to give known length width and thickness were analyzed on a dynamic mechanical analyzer in a tensile mode with a frequency of 1 Hz and heating rate of 5°C/min over the temperature range 40-350°C. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is conducted in accordance to ASTM test D5026, with the exception that only one test specimen is tested. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is determined by the maximum point of the tan delta curve.<br>
TMA: CTE values of the cast fihns were measured on a thermo-mechanical analyzer with a heating rate of 5°C/min from 0-250°C. CTE values were calculated from the slope over the range of 30-200°C.<br>
Equilibrium water. The equilibrium water content was defined as the moisture content of films allowed to stand at ambient conditions m the lab for 72h (about 25°C and 70% RH). The moisture content was measured by accurately weighing a sample of film 10.2 centimeters x 1.27 centimeters x 63.5 micrometers (about 4 inch x 0.5 inch X 0.0025 inch) before and after a drying. Fihns were weighed (to O.OOOOSg), dried in a 150°C oven for 4h, and then unmediately weighed to determine the moisture loss. Equilibrium water content is the mass lost upon heating divided by the mass of the dried film as a percent.<br>
Moisture absorption: Dried film samples (oven at 150°C for 4h) of known mass were submerged in water for 72h at ambient temperature (25°C). Following the time period, the films were removed irom the water and the excess moisture removed by diying with a Kimwipe. Moisture absorption is the mass uptake upon soaking in water divided by the weight of the dried film as a percent.<br>
Solubility: A positive result indicates that at a concentration of 10% solids, the fiilly imidized film cast from the poly(amic acid) solution dissolves in dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrolidinone (solvent indicated in the test) and can pass through a 0.45 micrometer filter.<br><br>

Procedure for the preparation of an organically modified clay (organoclay).<br>
The organically modified clay was prepared via ion exchange in water or a combination of water and an alcohol, or water and acetonitrile. The Na+ MMT (a clay with sodium counter ions) was dispersed in water or in the water/solvent combination at a concentration of 1 to 5% by weight of the nanoclay, and heated to 80°C. The organic cation, tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, was dissolved or dispersed water or solvent combination as above in a ratio such that when the solution or dispersion of the organic cation was added to the clay dispersion there were organic cations equal to or in excess of the cation ion exchange capacity of the dispersed clay. The mixture was then heated to reflux for 1 to 2 hours. Following cooling to room temperature, the modified clay was collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was poured off, and the solid modified clay was washed by redispersing the clay in deionized water or deionized water solvent combination and recollected by centrifugation. The wash solution was poured off and the wash process was repeated twice more. Following the final centrifugation, the solid clay was dried in an oven and then ground to a fine powder<br><br>
