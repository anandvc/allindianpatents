				<td>A SEARCHING SYSTEM ARRANGED TO SEARCH INFORMATION<br>
AVAILABLE FROM A SEARCH SPACE AND METHOD THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method<br>
for obtaining information from data sources.and, more<br>
particularly, but not exclusively, to a searching system<br>
and method for obtaining information from a plurality of<br>
heterogenous data sources.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Systems for carrying out searches of computing system<br>
based data sources are well known. They include search<br>
systems which are available to search data sources over<br>
networks such as the Internet. They also include search<br>
systems arranged to search data sources such as databases<br>
which are provided for specialist searching, such as<br>
medical databases, which may or may not be available over<br>
networks such as the Internet.<br>
For many systems, the information available from<br>
data sources is vast. In the medical area, for example,<br>
the amount of data available to medical professionals is<br>
enormous. It is very important that the medical<br>
professional be able to properly search this data in order<br>
for them to be able to make clinical decisions. One<br>
person cannot hope to personally keep up with developments<br>
in an area such as medicine and they must therefore rely<br>
on access to the available data sources. The search tools<br>
provided by any search system need to be adequate to<br>
facilitate an accurate and comprehensive search, which is<br>
able to be implemented speedily and without an<br>
inappropriate amount of effort required of the searcher.<br>
Presently available searching systems are not satisfactory<br>
in this regard. Present systems usually enable a searcher<br>
to input key words, combinations of key words and<br>
sometimes to select the aaca sources that are required to<br><br>
be searched. The accuracy and comprehensiveness of any<br>
such search depends for the most part on the skill and<br>
knowledge of the searcher. They must be able to decide on<br>
the appropriate key words to choose for the search, for<br>
example. It is plain fact that some people are more<br>
skilled in this than others. If they are to select the<br>
data sources available for the search, they must have the<br>
appropriate knowledge of the best data sources to search.<br>
If they haven't, the search will not be accurate or<br>
comprehensive. The selection of appropriate search<br>
criteria can also be extremely time consuming,<br>
particularly where the searcher is not particularly<br>
skilled or knowledgable in searching.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with a first aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a searching system arranged to search<br>
information available from a search space which includes<br>
at least one data source, the searching system comprising<br>
a user intexia.ce and a storage means arranged to store<br>
search templates, the search templates including pre-<br>
stored search parameters for controlling the search in<br>
accordance with the parameters and wherein a user is able<br>
to select a search template via the interface and the<br>
searching system is arranged to carry out the search in<br>
accordance with the pre-stored search parameters;<br>
the search templates including a plurality of user<br>
selectable search profiles, each search profile including<br>
parameters which are arranged to delimit a search space<br>
within the available search space whereby the search will<br>
occur within the delimited search space. <br>
The provision of a search template (s) effectively <br>
enables searching "knowledge" about the most effective way<br>
to search to be stored in the system, by way of search <br>
parameters. A user then has access to this pre-stored<br>
"knowledge" to facilitate their search. For example, a<br>
template may have been previously prepared and stored by a<br><br>
user or system administrator having particular knowledge<br>
of a particular search area. This knowledge can be<br>
subsequently applied to carry out future searches. The<br>
skills, time and effort required of a novice user is<br>
therefore greatly reduced. If they wish to carry out a<br>
particular search, the user can look for an appropriate<br>
template, via the interface, for carrying out the search<br>
they have in mind, and select the template. It is not<br>
necessary for the user to define the parameters for every<br>
search, they can use the pre-stored template.<br>
Preferably, the interface is arranged to enable new<br>
search templates to be prepared and added to the system,<br>
essentially providing a '"library" of search templates.<br>
Preferably, new templates can be added by users of the<br>
system and preferably, the system is arranged so that<br>
templates prepared by different users can be shared<br>
between users.<br>
Templates may also be prepared by users or system<br>
administrators who are specialised searchers.<br>
The search templates include "search profiles" which<br>
include search parameters. These parameters may include<br>
the period of the search (what time period of data sources<br>
is to be searched), data sources to be used in the search,<br>
specific ways in which the query must be expressed for any<br>
particular data source including selection of a keyword<br>
expression language understood by the data source, the<br>
time that the system is to take to carry out the search,<br>
and how the results of the search are to be presented.<br>
The search profile may also include predetermined keywords<br>
that operate to focus the search.<br>
The search profile parameters preferably specify how<br>
a search query must be expressed for each data source.<br>
Preferably, the search profiles are arranged to<br>
encapsulate the nature of the search inquiry. One of the<br>
parameters preferably includes the subject matter of the<br>
search inquiry. For example, where the system is arranged<br>
to search within the medical domain the search profile may<br><br>
reflect the nature of the clinical inquiry e.g.<br>
"treatment" may search the database from the aspect of a<br>
"treatment" approach. The subject matter that is searched<br>
by the "treatment" profile will preferably include data<br><br>
sources which are relevant to treatment or have a<br>
treatment bias. Further, the time period which is<br>
searched may be governed by the nature of search inquiry<br>
eg. If the subject matter of the search may determine that<br>
the search period be limited to a particular period in<br>
history, the profile will be so limited.<br>
Further, tne profile may include key words limiting<br>
the search to reflect the nature of the clinical enquiry.<br>
For example, for a "diagnosis" profile, appropriate key<br>
words may be used in the search profile eg "diagnosis".<br>
Preferably, the system enables a user to enter key<br>
words (additional to those that may be provided with the<br>
profile).<br>
Preferably, the system is arranged to categorise key<br>
words and to utilise key words in the search in dependence<br>
on the categorisation. In one embodiment, a plurality of<br>
predefined fields are provided for entry of the key words,<br>
each of the fields defining a particular category. The<br>
searching system may assign different importance to key<br>
words depending upon the category. In one embodiment, the<br>
manner of the search applied by the category will depend<br>
upon the profile selected.<br>
Profiles may be organised hierarchically. Such<br>
hierarchically organised profiles may include "parent" and<br>
"child" profiles. The child profile may provide a more<br>
"focused" search within a narrow area within the ambit of<br>
the parent profile. Preferably, the system interface<br>
enables the user to view the profiles within their<br>
hierarchy to enable selection of an appropriate profile<br>
for a search enquiry.<br>
The search templates preferably further include<br>
"Saved Searches", preferably including a plurality of key<br>
words for use by the searching system in carrying out the<br>
search. Keywords can may be arranged according to a<br>
predefined expression language, such as Boolean logical<br>
operators. Provision of this facility enables the user to<br>
proceed with a search without having to go to the time and<br><br>
trouble of selecting key words, or arranging them into the<br>
most appropriate expression using a predefined language<br>
like Boolean logic. Small alternations in keywords or<br>
keyword expressions provided to search systems can result<br>
in substantial variation in search success, and the use of<br>
expert provided keyword sets for typical search topics<br>
enables novice searchers to use keywords preselected for<br>
their suitability to a specific type of search.<br>
Preferably, the searching system is arranged to<br>
present the results of any search to a user via the<br>
interface.<br>
Preferably, the search templates also operate to<br>
provide control parameters to control the way in which the<br>
results of the search are presented to the user.<br>
Preferably, the searching system is arranged to<br>
enable users to amend search templates.<br>
Preferably, the interface also includes a means<br>
whereby a user may carry out a standard search in a<br>
convent ional manner.<br>
Preferably, the searching system is arranged to<br>
carry out searches over a plurality of data sources.<br>
Preferably, the system may be arranged so that each data<br>
source or sources may be searched more than once for a<br>
particular search enquiry, either by parallel multiple<br>
searches or consecutively. Preferably, where the same<br>
data source or sources are searched more than once, each<br>
of the searches can have a different ratio between<br>
selectivity and specificity.<br>
This enables multiple searches with different<br>
coverages and approaches to be carried out without any<br>
extra input from the user.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect, the present<br>
invention provides, in a searching system which is<br>
arranged to search information available from a search<br>
space which includes at least one data source, a method of<br>
controlling the searching system by providing a search<br>
template including pre-stored search parameters for<br><br>
controlling the search in accordance with the parameters,<br>
the search templates including a plurality of user<br>
selectable search profiles, each search profile including<br>
parameters which are arranged to delimit a search space<br>
within the available search space whereby the search will<br>
occur within the delimited search space.<br><br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a computer, program arranaed.<br>
when loaded on a computing_system. to. control the<br>
computing system to provide a searching system in<br>
accordance with the first aspect of the present. invention<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present<br>
^invention, there is provided a computer readable medium<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a searching system in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention, that<br><br>
comprises a computing system 1 implementing the searching<br>
system, and providing a user interface to user terminals<br>
~T7 The user terminals 2 may comprise any appropriate<br>
computing apparatus, and in this case are illustrated as<br>
being conventional PC's which may be linked to the<br>
computing system 1 by any appropriate link or network, and<br>
in this example the link is via the Internet.<br>
The computing system 1 may also be implemented by any<br>
appropriate computing apparatus, and in this example is<br>
implemented as a server which is capaole of providing web<br>
pages to Trser-~fea?©w»«sS"-ieaded on user terminals 2, in a<br>
Tcnbwn manner.<br>
The computing system 1 has access to data sources 3,<br>
4, 5, 6, containing data which is able to be searched by<br>
the system 1. In this,example, a local data source 3 is<br>
illustrated which is connected to the computing system 1<br>
and which may comprise a conventional data base, and also<br>
sources 4, 5, 6 which are accessible over a network such<br>
as the Internet. Local or remote data sources are shown<br>
by way of example only and it will be appreciated that all<br>
data sources may be remote or all may be local, or as<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, there may be a mixture of both<br>
types of data sources available to the system 1.<br>
The system of the present invention may be capable of<br>
accessing and searching any available data source. In<br>
this example embodiment, however, the data sources store<br>
medical information, and the searching system is arranged<br>
to facilitate clinical searches that may be undertaken by<br>
medical professionals. It will be appreciated, however,<br>
that the system of the present invention may be applied to<br>
any subject matter field and any data sources, and is not<br>
limited to the domain of medicine.<br>
Referring to figure 2, the broad architecture of the<br>
system 1 comprises a user interface 10 which enables the<br>
user to access the searching system and which in this<br>
example comprises a web based interface provided by<br>
computing system 1 and browsers on the client systems 2.<br><br>
The system also includes means for storing search<br>
templates, which include pre-stored search parameters for<br>
controlling the search in accordance with the parameters,<br>
and which in this example include "searches" 11 and<br>
"profiles" 12. Each of the searches 11 includes one or<br>
more key words which have been pre-stored for particular<br>
types of searches which the user may wish to carry out,<br>
and the profiles include other parameters such as the<br>
dates of publications which the search may be limited to,<br>
the selection of the databases to be searched, other<br>
keywords which may facilitate limitations to a particular<br>
"profile", and other parameters as will become more clear<br>
from the following detailed description. -'<br>
The system architecture also includes a profile<br>
manager 13 for managing the profiles, and a search engine<br>
14 for implementing the search in accordance with the<br>
search templates to search the database data sources 15.<br>
Operation of the system will now be described with<br>
reference to figures 3 through 10.<br>
Note that in some of the drawings which represent<br>
example screen shots, trademarks are used ("Quick<br>
Clinical"). It will be appreciated that the invention is<br>
not limited by any of this trademark matter.<br>
Figure 4 represents a screen presented to a user<br>
system 2 via the interface 10 from which a user will enter<br>
instructions to carry out a search following "Start"<br>
(reference numeral 20, figure 3) system. This screen<br>
includes a profile window 100 to enable a' user to select<br>
search profiles 12 and an advanced search window 101 which<br>
enables a user to select searches 11. The page also<br>
includes commands 102 which can be selected for other<br>
operations which are typical of Internet based systems,<br>
such as, for example, "Logout".<br>
In this medical based system, correct selection of<br>
the profile 12 is very important for accurate and<br>
clinically valid searches.<br>
Selection of profile 12 is via a drop down list<br><br>
arrangement as illustrated at reference numeral 104 in<br>
figure 5. Note in figure 5 that the search has changed to<br>
a "Simple Search" 103. Figure 4 illustrates at 101 the<br>
"Advanced Search" option. Simple"Search and Advanced<br>
Search are discussed further in the following.<br>
The pre-stored search profiles 12 are named for ease<br>
of reference as is shown in the drop down list 104. They<br>
are also organised hierarchically. For example, search<br>
profile "Treatment" is a "leading" search profile which<br>
will cause the searching system to look into data sources<br>
which contain information relevant to treatment rather<br>
than to diagnosis, aetiology or patient education, for<br>
example. The daughter search profiles of "Treatment",<br>
shown here as "Pharmacological", "Preventative" and<br>
"Surgical" will look into.to treatment into these<br>
particular areas. There may be any number of levels of<br>
hierarchy, as will be appreciated.<br>
Any profile includes a number of parameters, which<br>
delimit the search according to the parameters. Profiles<br>
may be edited and new profiles may be created, via profile<br>
manager 13 (reference numerals 22 and 23 of figure 3,<br>
respectively). Figure 6 is an illustration of a screen<br>
displayed to a user who wishes to add or amend a profile.<br>
In this embodiment, any profile has the following<br>
attributes:<br>
• A profile ID 105<br>
• Date to search articles from 106<br>
• Date to search articles to 107<br>
• How to sort or rank articles (eg. by date, by title, by<br>
author, by journal-name etc) 108<br>
• Data sources to be searched by the search 109<br>
• The search duration 110<br>
• The search subject (for now this simply gets appended to<br>
search keywords) 111.<br>
• The hierarchy of the profile (denoted by the profile id<br>
of this profiles immediate parent) 200.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that other embodiments may-<br>
include other parameters that may be defined by a search<br>
profile. A major advantage of utilising profiles is that<br>
the users "knowledge" of a particular area to be searched<br>
can effectively be stored in the system to be reused again<br>
by the user and other users. Preferably, search profiles<br>
may be available to a number of users eg. medical<br>
professionals. Users may update or amend or add new<br>
profiles utilising their particular knowledge of an area.<br>
Over time, therefore, the system increases its knowledge<br>
base. Searching becomes quicker and more accurate. The<br>
search profile reflects the nature of the search enquiry.<br>
This embodiment, the search profile reflects £he nature of<br>
the clinical enquiry. The search profile therefore<br>
provides a "focussing" of the search. The search profile<br>
may include search keywords to define the profile. It may<br>
be facilitated by search key words which are selected or<br>
entered by a user when carrying out a search.<br>
If the user selects a profile name, the corresponding<br>
profile characteristics are fetched and displayed in a<br>
similar manner to the display of figure 6. The profile<br>
parameter values may be changed. A change in the profiles<br>
name (ID), however, has a special significance. If the<br>
name 105 is not change, then the profiles characteristics<br>
simply get updated. If the name, however, is changed, the<br>
profile is considered a new profile and it is saved as a<br>
immediate child of the profile initially displayed.<br>
If users wish to change the profile name, they may do<br>
so by clicking on the "Rename" button (not shown but<br>
present in the table that displays the profile<br>
characteristics of another existing profile - it is merely<br>
the display of figure 6 with the addition of the "Rename"<br>
button). In this case, none of the other profile<br>
characteristics will change. This is done to separate the<br>
functionality of renaming a profile from simply changing<br>
the profile details.<br>
At all times, if the profile name is left blank or<br><br>
with a default descriptive phrase, the new profile becomes<br>
temporary and is saved as '"Current Profile" in a<br>
corresponding hierarchy level.<br>
Once a profile has been selected (reference numerals<br>
22, 23, 24 of figure 3) either by creating a new profile<br>
or choosing an already existing profile, then a "Search"<br>
needs to be selected. The system provides the option of a<br>
"Simple Search" (reference numeral 25 of figure 3) or a<br>
*Advanced Search" (reference numeral 26 of figure 3) . If<br>
a Simple Search is selected (reference numeral 103, figure<br>
5), the user merely enters key words that are appropriate<br>
for the search.<br>
If the option of "Advanced Search" is chosen (see<br>
figure 7), the user has two alternatives.<br>
In the first alternative, the user may create a new<br>
Advanced Search (reference numerals 27 and 28 of figure 3)<br>
via the Search Manager 16. Figure 7 illustrates an<br>
example screen presented to the user for Advanced Search.<br>
The user enters key words in field 210. The key words may<br>
be words or phrases with AND OR NOT qualifiers. By typing<br>
a word or phrase in the "but not" 211 window, the search<br>
will exclude all sources containing this word or phrase.<br>
The user may choose to save their Advanced Search for<br>
future use by typing a name characteristic for this search<br>
in the "Save As" 212 window and clicking on the Save 213<br>
button. The search is then saved for future use by the<br>
user and other users. Saving searches as a template adds<br>
further to the "Knowledge" of the system. Saved Searches<br>
can be created by users, shared between users and edited<br>
in a similar manner to Profiles.<br>
The alternative option than a user creating their own<br>
Advanced Search, is for a user to select a pre-stored<br>
Advanced Search template (reference numeral 2 9 of figure<br>
3). Figure 8 illustrates the drop down list for the saved<br>
searches. The drop down list 114 includes names of all<br>
the saved searches that have been saved. Clicking on a<br><br>
name eg. asthma search 215 selects that search and also<br>
gives a list of the key words 116 which the search<br>
includes. Once the search has been selected (27, 28, 2 9<br>
of figure 3) the user may initiate the search (reference<br>
numeral 30 figure 3) by pressing the "Go" button 115. The<br>
search engine 14 then initiates the search based on the<br>
instructions from the search profile and the Search<br>
selected. The search engine 14 searches the data sources<br>
15 and provides, in this embodiment, an XML document back<br>
to the system. The XML document is parsed and the results<br>
are displayed by the interface 10 in a user friendly<br>
manner.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates an example display'^of search<br>
results. The layout of the display is effected by the<br>
selection of the original Search and Profile. At the very<br>
top of the display 116 a summary of the search is<br>
presented, which shows the data sources which were used<br>
and also names the search. The search results are then<br>
listed in accordance with the "ranking" stated in the<br>
profile in a list further down screen 117. Documents<br>
coming from different sources are grouped together to<br>
represent main categories such as guidelines, journals and<br>
text books. Numbers in brackets represent the amount of<br>
documents found in each category.<br>
The user may view the list of retrieved documents by<br>
moving the scroll bar 118 up and down. By clicking on any<br>
of the underlined text "More Information" the user may<br>
view the details of the retrieved document. Further<br>
information could include various levels of detail such as<br>
an abstract or a link to a full document.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates an example display of a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention which does not include<br>
an option for "Advanced Search" or "Simple Search". In<br>
this Profile Manager embodiment a saved search 50 can be<br>
selected or alternatively key words can be entered via a<br>
plurality of fields 51 which can be defined and arranged<br>
to provide a categorisation for each of the key words to<br><br>
be entered. In the example illustrated, key words may be<br>
entered in the categories "Disease", "Drug ", Symptoms"<br>
and "Others".<br>
The profile manager 13 may assign different<br>
importance or treat the key words in each category<br>
differently depending upon the profile that has been<br>
selected. For example, "A Disease " category key word is<br>
more important in "Diagnosis" profile and a "Drug" key<br>
word is more important in the "Prescribing" profile. The<br>
search can be affected by the category assigned to key<br>
words, as well as the profile.<br>
A further facility of this further embodiment of the<br>
invention is the facility to search a data source more .<br>
than once for each search inquiry. Referring to Figure<br>
11, this embodiment offers' "match 1" "match 2" 53 searches<br>
for the same search enquiry. Match 1 and Match 2 apply<br>
different searching approaches as regards selectivity and<br>
specificity. For example, the first search "match 1" of<br>
the data source can be specified as extremely narrow and<br>
have high priority in the "mix" of results, e.g. by using<br>
all key words that have been typed in by the searcher and<br>
by searching in "titles", and "abstracts" only. The<br>
second search "match 2" can vary the ratio between<br>
selectivity and specificity , appropriate for the size and<br>
clinical importance of the source. Although this<br>
embodiment shows two different types of searches to be<br>
applied to the source, it will be appreciated that further<br>
searches having varied ratios between selectivity and<br>
specificity can be incorporated.<br>
For the same search inquiry, therefore, several<br>
searches having different approaches to the same data<br>
source can be carried out.<br>
The above embodiment has been specifically designed<br>
for use for medical professional for searching databases<br>
for clinical knowledge..._._, It will be appreciated that the<br>
system of the present invention can be used to search any<br>
data source and is not limited to data sources containing<br><br>
medical knowledge.<br>
The above embodiment is arranged to search data<br>
sources over a network such as the Internet. It will be<br>
appreciated that the present invention is not limited to a<br>
system which searches data sources over the Internet.<br>
Other embodiments may search databases locally to a<br>
computing system, may search over a network that is not<br>
the Internet, or may do a mixture of both.<br>
In the above embodiment, search templates are<br>
separated into Search Profiles and Searches. It will be<br>
appreciated that a search template may be organised in<br>
different ways to this.<br>
As discussed above, search profiles are'ynot limited<br>
by the parameters which have been listed in the above<br>
embodiment. Many other search parameters are possible for<br>
profiles.<br>
For example, a search profile may specify the order<br>
in which the results from different sources are presented<br>
by the user interface (eg. source 1, then source 2, then<br>
source 3) whether they are intermingled according to a<br>
defined ranking criterio. Also the number of results to<br>
be reported back from a source can be specified. Further,<br>
a profile may specify which elements of a result are<br>
displayed eg. for an article title, author, journal,<br>
elements, abstract or elements abstracted from text, and<br>
links to that article. These are all different sub<br>
components of the document, which the searching system may<br>
recognise from a predefined structure according to the<br>
stored document model, for example in XML which recognises<br>
either tags in the retrieved document or searches for key<br>
words which identify the specific document component.<br>
A profile may also indicate whether the sources are<br>
to be "linked". For example, a CD-Rom version of a text<br>
book can be stored locally and be fast to access, and a<br>
Web version might be more up to date, but slower. A<br>
profile may define that the two sources are linked and<br>
integrate their results so that they speak with "one<br><br>
voice" to the user.<br>
Further, some data sources may understand special<br>
commands eg. the MEDLINE™ system recognises defined words<br>
from MESH, and combines keywords in its own standard<br>
expression language and the profile could define specific<br>
use of key words for different sources.<br>
Note that, as discussed above profiles may have<br>
their own associated key words (preferably arranged into<br>
the most appropriate expressions) which will be used at<br>
all times with the search.<br>
Other attributes that a profile may have include the<br>
following:<br>
for each data source;<br>
number of results to retrieve from this source;<br>
weight (ie. Contribution from this source to mix)<br>
maximum search time;<br>
priority of the source in the mix;<br>
lexical variant generation capability on/off.<br>
The system may include a dictionary of words which<br>
may be selected from by the user as key words, in order to<br>
assist the user.<br>
Another option for profiles is that they could<br>
include some parameters that are permanently fixed and<br>
cannot be edited by users. For example, it may be<br>
desirable to ensure that a particular profile for<br>
searching anatomy is always searches "Grays Anatomy" and<br>
the Search Profile may be fixed so that this text is<br>
always searched. Other aspects of the profile could be<br>
amended. On the other hand, the profile could include a<br>
parameter which specifies that a particular source is not<br>
to be searched.<br>
As discussed above, search templates (including<br>
profiles and searches )can be shared between users. This<br>
can be done in any number of ways. For example, all new<br>
templates may be stored centrally by the system and shared<br>
by all, or stored centrally and only available to the user<br>
who created it, or available to a certain group (much like<br><br>
a bulletin board with a subscriber model). Alternatively,<br>
new templates may be stored locally on the user's system<br>
and only used by the creator. A further alternative is<br>
that all new templates may be stored centrally but down<br>
loaded to a local computer to be added to its library, so<br>
that there may be a separate template library to the core<br>
templates normally available - users browse the library to<br>
add more templates to their system to suit their<br>
particular needs.<br>
There are also other options for sharing templates.<br>
The searching system of the present invention, it will be<br>
appreciated, may be implemented by any software/hardware<br>
arrangement that implements the functions described above.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above description the<br>
present invention is concerned with the user interface and<br>
the provision of search queries for searching multiple<br>
databases (the "front end")- The actual search engine<br>
(the "back end") which implements the search queries<br>
formulated in accordance with the present invention, is<br>
not part of the present invention. Any appropriate search<br>
engine which can search the data source may be utilised to<br>
search in accordance with the search template.<br>
The following two examples illustrate aspects of the<br>
embodiment of the present invention. One example relates<br>
to searching of clinical databases. The other example<br>
relates to searching of legal databases, in order to<br>
illustrate that the system can be applied across any<br>
subject matter.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The user may choose one of many available profiles, each<br>
of which has the capacity to modify the search query<br>
without user intervention.<br>
Table 1. Detailed design of the profile "Diagnosis".<br>
#1#, #2#, #3#, #4# indicate the content typed by the users<br>
as keywords.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
There are three ways in which the profile reflects the<br>
nature of the search.<br>
by adding additional search words to the search query<br>
by restricting the search space within the selected source<br>
by allowing to perform search only on sources which are<br>
most relevant to the nature of the medical enquiry<br>
The example above shows the profile "diagnosis".<br>
Additional words such as "diagnosis" or 'signs and<br>
symptoms" are being included in the search query without<br>
user intervention.<br>
The search space restriction is illustrated by using words<br>
such as " Practice Guidelines - English - lOyears<br>
Human" applied to the PubMed source, once again<br>
transparent to the user.<br>
Only four out of 8 sources are used in the profile<br>
"Diagnosis" because only these sources contain^ information<br>
most relevant to the medical enquiries in the area of<br>
differential diagnosis.<br>
The Keywords.<br>
The properly defined search query requires that the user<br>
makes a choice of the search profile and types at least<br>
one keyword. However user may attempt to make much more<br>
complex search using many keywords at the same time. The<br>
user interface allows to streamline this process of<br>
entering the keywords by.<br>
Providing multiple entry fields with descriptors<br>
Providing "Builder" functionality which assists in making<br>
more complex Boolean logic enquiries.<br>
Categorisation of the keywords.<br>
A unique feature of the user interface is the<br>
categorization of keywords<br>
The above example indicates that different keywords can be<br>
entered in separate entry fields according to their<br>
meaning. Disease names are expected to by entered in the<br>
field with the "disease" descriptor or drug names to be<br>
entered in the field with the "drug" descriptor.<br>
This unique approach allows the system to "know" the<br>
category to which each keyword belongs. That knowledge is<br>
use in the profile engineering to assign different<br>
importance to keyword categories (eg. keyword entered as<br>
"disease" is of primary importance in the "Diagnosis" and<br>
"Treatment" profile but the drug name is most important in<br>
"Drug info" profile)<br>
Multiple search in, the same source.<br>
The information contained in any specific source is<br>
usually structured according to certain pre-defined rules.<br>
For example textbooks are structured as sections,<br>
chapters, sub-chapters, paragraphs. Other sources such<br>
as PubMed may use purpose-build lists of key terms such as<br>
MeSH to promote the better search techniques.<br>
The system allows to explore such pre-defined structure of<br>
the data source by conducting multiple searches on the<br>
same source with various level of specificity and<br>
precision. An example of this would be to search for the<br>
main keyword first in the titles, then in the abstract or<br>
summary, and then in the main body of the text. The<br>
results are then checked for duplicates and displayed<br>
together in the pre-defined order.<br>
Table 2 above illustrates this approach with two sources,<br>
allowing for two searches in each source in response to<br>
the single user enquiry. Theoretically there is no limit<br>
on the amount of multiple searches conducted on one<br>
source.<br>
Search results.<br>
The results obtained in response to the search query are<br>
grouped according to a certain criteria. The examples of<br>
the categories are : Journals, Textbooks and Guidelines.<br>
(ref numeral 300, Fig 12) . New categories can be created<br>
in future as well as the new functionality to performed<br>
the secondary searches (on previously retrieved results)<br>
The user may choose to read abstract of the selected<br>
PubMed article or full text info retrieved from the other<br>
sources as illustrated in Figure 12.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Similar search capacity as employed in the medical field<br>
of knowledge can be used in the field of legal enquiries.<br>
The capacity of using multiple sources and multiple entry<br>
fields would be most suitable for complex, multi-indexed<br>
data sources. One of the hypothetical examples can be<br>
illustrated as follows:<br>
Examples of hypothetical search profiles may include :<br>
Criminal, Family, Fraud and Legislation. Esentially any<br>
well defined type of legal enquiry can became a pre-<br>
defined search profile.<br>
Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a<br>
skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
