				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a waste disposal device for use in disposing and processing of wastes, including human excrement, organic and other material.<br>
These wastes may, for example, emanate from conventional toilet systems or from common domestic, industrial, agricultural and/or medical wastes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In urban areas around the world the process of disposing waste involves a coÂ¬ordinated and mechanized system in which the local authority waste removal section plays a prime active role. Domestic organic waste is commonly collected from households in refuse bags, human waste via sewerage systems or trucking, to sites where the waste is accumulated for further processing.<br>
In the development of modern sanitation systems water remains as one of the principal components in the system. However, various alternative or modified forms of waste disposal devices have been disclosed in the past, for example, the oil-flush toilet system as taught by Claunch in US 3 673 614 and US 3 974 528 and foam-flush toilet as taught by Masami Miya in US 3 585 649.<br>
In EP 014 722, Claunch described a device and a process for treating organic waste wherein a thermophilic-evaporator-digestor is incorporated into each of the above alternative forms of toilet systems. The process involves the steps of evaporating water out of the waste at elevated temperatures and supporting aerobic high-temperature bacterial activity, which steps are both dependent upon aeration of the wastes at said elevated temperatures.<br>
US 3 279 311 disclosed a sewage treatment system in which the waste is macerated and subjected to aerobic digestion, then allowed to settle so that water can be decanted off and recycled as flush water.<br>
None of the above processes makes any reference to a water-less reticulation system.<br><br>
One of the major problems associated with lavatory systems is ground water pollution. Bacterial activity on the excrement waste releases water and toxins from the waste and these toxins are then carried into the ground water by seepage of the waste water through the soil profile, such that, in time, the toxins end up in wells, boreholes, rivers and streams which, in many instances, are used by the community as drinking water. This phenomenon has been confirmed to be one of the main causes of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhoea.<br>
As a solution to this problem a "septic tank"concept was introduced whereby an impervious tank is built below ground to prevent seepage of waste water through the soil profile. Anaerobic digestion of the waste occurs in the tank and an overflow of cleaner water enters a "French drain"trench filled with rubble. The effect of this modification is that the carry over of harmful toxins is reduced.<br>
The present invention is particularly directed towards a waste disposal device for use in areas where water supply remains acute, for example, the high temperature arid and/or rural regions. In these localities the water-flush toilet systems are typically an unaffordable luxury, mainly due to the infrastructure required.<br>
Certain toilet inventions known to the inventor involve a dry excrement processing system. These systems are anchored onto a dug-out hole in the ground and normally include an enclosure having a door. A chute is arranged above and in alignment with the hole.<br>
Such systems are usually equipped with a ventilation unit, which includes a vent pipe which is arranged above the hole outside the enclosure so as to remove any odour of the waste from the hole to the ambient atmosphere.<br>
For hygienic reasons it is preferred that the tubular structure is constructed to be sufficiently long enough to vent the smell into the atmosphere to remove it from a human communal environment. The exposure of the tubular unit to a blazing sun and ambient heat creates a convection draft towards the tubular structure, which convection causes the smell and the air borne germs to rise with the rising waste gases and to be drawn towards an exit opening of the vent pipe and out of the system.<br><br>
South African patent 99/04945 describes a method of dry treatment of human excrement. This system includes a specially designed helical screw-shaped conveyer that is made up of a tube having, on its inner surface, flights which are arranged in a screw-like configuration. The human waste, which falls down a chute, is directed into a flight at one end of the conveyer. Every time the seat is lifted a mechanism rotates the conveyer, and thereby the flights move the excrement gradually along in a tumbling motion before it falls into a disposable bag arranged at a far end of the conveyer tube.<br>
A small ventilation fan is used to eliminate and discharge odour by creating a constant flow of air down the toilet bowl. The ventilation also evaporates urine and toilet pan cleaning fluids.<br>
One of the major concerns, in this instance, is the size of this assembled system. It is estimated that its length, as measured from a tip of the bowl to an outlet end of the helical conveyer, is about 2 250 millimetres and its depth is about 1 140 millimetres. As such, there may be practical problems associated with transporting a structure of this magnitude, besides the fact that, upon installation, it requires a deep excavation.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a waste disposal device for disposal of waste material, including human and animal excrement, domestic, agricultural, medical and/or industrial waste material and products, the device comprising:<br>
a shell for receiving the waste material, the shell including a surface that turns horizontally about an upright or near upright axis;<br>
an actuating means for facilitating an incremental turning motion of the surface of the shell about said upright axis;<br>
a chute for depositing the waste material onto the surface of the shell thereby causing the waste material to be carried around in the shell ;<br><br>
a deflector for deflecting the waste material from the surface of the shell into a central waste collection region; and<br>
a means for generating or providing an air-flow which follows a path that includes the waste material deposits from the chute to a position where air is drawn out of the shell.<br>
The surface of the shell may be in the form of a disc having at least one generally flat or horizontal surface and a support body, the disc being able to turn on the support body.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the disc has more than one generally flat surface which, in a plan view, define a set of concentric rings, which arc joined to another and an inner aperture.<br>
Said flat surfaces may be arranged in a declining stepped relation such that, from., a side view, the disc is defined by a set of descending stages, which stages are joined to one another and the flat surfaces include an uppermost and a lowermost flat surface.<br>
Typically the disc is manufactured from a material having a low friction inducing capacity.<br>
To this end the disc may be manufactured from a suitable material that provides a non-stick surface thereby preventing adhesion of deposited waste material on the surface of the disc.<br>
Said suitable material may be any material that permits the disc to turn whilst in a position mounted on or against the support body. An intermediate material can be used, or rollers, bearings, nylon rod or other means can be used.<br>
Said low friction inducing material may be selected from a group comprising, but not limited to, synthetic polymeric material including polyethylene based material such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) or polytertraflouroethylene (PTFE).<br><br>
The support body may be manufactured from any suitably tough material selected from, but not limited to, metals, alloys and synthetic polymeric material, an example is fibre reinforced resins.<br>
The support body may be shaped to complement the dimensions and shape of the disc such that the disc fits into/onto the support body and remains able to turn thereon.<br>
Said support body may be shaped such that it can be anchored onto another surface such as the ground.<br>
Optionally the support body may be provided with a plurality of ribs, ridges or the like for holding the support body firmly in or onto an anchoring position.<br>
The support body may have the central waste material collection region defined thereon.<br>
The central waste material collection region may be in the form a cupola which is inverted in a mid-portion of the support body.<br>
The collection region may be configured to have a shape which complements the aperture on the disc, such that, as the disc turns the waste material on the surface of the disc can eventually reach the cupola.<br>
The cupola may be configured to detachably support a receptacle unit therein.<br>
Said receptacle unit may be in the form of any suitable material used for packaging, covering or wrapping waste material deposits for example a bag or a container.<br>
Said receptacle may be in the form of a conventional refuse bag.<br>
The actuator may include at least one rigid elongated member.<br>
The actuator may be connected to the disc by means of the elongated ; : member in a ratchet-like formation.<br><br>
Typically said ratchet-like formation includes angled teeth or like protrusions which are defined on an outer edge of the disc to engage the elongated member of the actuator in a manner that prevents reverse motion. An alternative would be holes or other formations or other means of turning the disc.<br>
The shell may be provided with a cover portion.<br>
The cover portion may be manufactured from any suitable material selected from, but not limited to, metals, alloys-and synthetic polymeric material. The insulation of the exposed area of the cover portion is preferably exposed, i. e. not buried. The cover supplies heat from the sun, to promote the treatment of the waste.<br>
Said cover portion may have an access aperture for allowing inspection and access to the contents of the shell.<br>
Typically the access aperture provides access for allowing the receptacle to be detachably supported and arranged within the central waste material collection region of the support body and to allow removal of a receptacle that has been filled with waste material deposits out of the shell.<br>
The access aperture may be provided with a shutter which is configured to detachably cover the access aperture.<br>
The actuator may be configured and shaped to fit through the cover portion in such a manner that the elongated member of the actuator is operable from above the cover portion.<br>
The actuator may be manually operated by means of handle or knob which is accessible above the cover portion.<br>
Optionally the actuator may be operated electrically or by any suitable mechanism.<br>
Typically the chute is defined on the cover portion to form an upright or near upright channel through the cover portion such that, in assembly, said channel is aligned directly above the uppermost surface of the disc.<br><br>
Said channel may correspondingly be arranged to allow waste material to be deposited directly onto the uppermost surface of the disc.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention the chute may be provided with a bowl which is defined on or above the cover portion, said bowl being connected to the upright or near upright channel of the chute.<br>
The bowl may be provided with a lid.<br>
Said lid may be hingedly mounted on the bowl in an opening and a closing position.<br>
Said lid may be operably connected to the actuator such that, in use, a movement of opening and/or closing the lid causes the actuator to incrementally turn the shell in a ratchet-like motion thereby allowing the deposited waste material to be carried along on the surface of the disc.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention the actuator may include a recoilable shuttle which is connected to the operating handle.<br>
Said recoilable shuttle may include a cable for connecting it to the operating handle ; a pawl being engaged to the angled protrusions of the disc, a spring, one end of which is attached to the shuttle and supported on the support body.<br>
The pawl may include a hook member, said hook member being configured to engage the angled protrusions.<br>
In use, an application of a pulling force on the operating handle pulls the cable thereby turning the disc from one angled protrusion to another whilst, simultaneously, the spring provides an opposing pulling force to return the actuator to its initial position upon release of the operating handle.<br>
Typically the deflector is in the form of a barrier member which is mounted onto the cover portion adjacent to the upright or near upright channel of then chute.<br><br>
The deflector may be in the form of a tab which is mounted underneath the cover portion such that, in assembly, a bottom edge of the tab makes contact with the surface of the disc.<br>
Typically the deflector is oriented in such a manner that in use, as the disc turns incrementally, the waste material deposits progressively pile against the deflector and are deflected from the surface of the disc into the central waste collection region.<br>
To this end, the deflector may be oriented at an obtuse angle relative to an outer edge or tangent of the disc surface.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention there is provided a plurality of deflectors which are arranged to make contact with the plurality of disc surfaces such that the waste material deposits are progressively deflected from one disc surface to another until they are deflected into the central waste collection region.<br>
Typically the means for generating or providing an air-flow is a ventilation unit which comprises a conduit for linking the shell to a vent pipe.<br>
Said air flow of the ventilation unit desirably provides a drying effect and carries away air-borne microscopic germs and other harmful elements including a bad smell that is generated by the waste material deposits within the shell.<br>
The conduit of the ventilation unit may be located on the cover portion of the shell at a suitable position, one position is above the waste collection region.<br>
Said conduit may be connectable to an tubular structure for venting air which is extracted from the shell to the ambient atmosphere.<br>
If required, a filter may be incorporated in vent.<br>
To this end the tubular structure may be provided with a fan or an extractor for extracting or drawing air out of the shell, to enhance air flow.<br><br>
Said fan or extractor may be mounted anywhere on or in the tubular structure to enable direction of the air flow out of the shell.<br>
The path of the air flow may be defined by a partitioning means. The partitioning means may be arranged along an inner edge or tangent of the surface of the disc.<br>
Typically the partitioning means is arranged along the surface of the disc so as to constrain the air flow-path that includes the waste material deposits from the chute to a position where air is drawn out of the shell.<br>
Said partitioning means may be shaped to form a cylindrical curtain which separates portions of the surface of the disc from one another and from the central waste material collection region.<br>
Said partitioning means may be manufactured from a suitably resilient material.<br>
Said resilient material may include any suitable plastics material.<br>
The partitioning means may comprise a woven cloth, which is impregnated with a plastics material having a thickness of between 0.1 to 2 mm; preferably between 0. 5 to 1.2 mm.<br>
The partitioning means also serves a function of preventing contact via the access aperture with unprocessed waste.<br>
Typically the assembled waste disposal device has a diameter, as measured longitudinally between two extreme opposite ends of the cover portion through the central waste collection region, of about 1 600 millimetres, and a depth of about 650 millimetres. The size can be increased or decreased to suit specific requirements and/or applications.<br>
Advantageously, a waste disposal device according to the present invention is considerably simpler and less expensive than that of known art and is easier to transport. It may be installed in a number of simple and uncomplicated steps whilst it occupies a minimum amount of land space and does not require deep excavation.<br><br>
THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of illustration only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings.<br>
In the drawings,<br>
Figure 1 shows a plan view of an assembled waste disposal device in the form of a shell 10 in partial cross-section.<br>
Figure 2 shows a side elevation of the assembled shell 10 also in partial cross-section.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show alternative embodiments of the waste disposal device in an exploded formation.<br>
Figures 5 to 9 illustrate different external and internal projections of an assembled formation of the shell shaped waste disposal device of Figure 4.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 illustrate a side elevation and a plan view respectively of one example of an actuating device.<br>
The figures as provided are by way of illustration of specific embodiments only and are not intended to, in any way, limit the invention. It is believed that the waste disposal unit can be modified or adapted in accordance with operational and application requirements without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
In Figure 1 the waste disposal device in the form of a shell 10 is shown having a support body 12 and a disc 14, the disc being able to turn on/in the support body 12, to lend rigidity to the component.<br>
The support body 12 has a plurality of ribs which are arranged along an outer wall of the support body 12.<br>
The disc 14 has a ring shaped flat surface 16 and an inner aperture 18 which is located above a central waste collection region 20.<br><br>
A deflector 22 is positioned above the flat surface 16 of the disc 14 such the deflector 22 makes contact with the flat surface 16, and the deflector 22 is optionally mounted underneath a cover portion 24.<br>
A chute 26 for depositing waste material is defined on the cover portion 24 of the shell 10 to form a channel through the cover portion 24 such that the chute 26 is aligned directly above the surface 16 of the disc 14 so that the waste material deposited into the chute can descend directly upon the flat surface 16 of the disc 14.<br>
The chute 26 is provided with a bowl 28 which is operably connected to an actuator 30; the actuator 30 comprising an operating handle.<br>
Above the cover portion 24 a wall 32 partitions the chute 26 and bowl 28 from a ventilation unit 34; the ventilation unit 34 comprising a vent pipe and an extraction fan 36 which is positioned within the vent pipe.<br>
The ventilation unit 34 is located above and encloses an access aperture 38 ; the access aperture 38 providing access to the central waste material collection region 20.<br>
Optionally the ventilation unit 34 is located separate from the access aperture 38 such that the access aperture 38 is provided with a shutter 40 which is configured to detachably cover the access aperture (see Figure 4).<br>
Figure 2 shows the disc 14 having a set of angled teeth 42 which are defined on an outer edge of the disc 14 to engage the actuator 30 in a ratchet-like formation to turn the disc 14 incrementally. Rotation can be clockwise or anti- clockwise.<br>
The deflector 22 is shown mounted on an underneath surface of the cover portion.<br>
The deflector 22 is oriented at an obtuse angle relative to an outer edge or tangent of the disc surface 16 such that, in use, as the disc 14 turns, the waste material deposits can progressively pile against the deflector 22 after which said deposits are deflected from the surface 16 of the disc 14 into the central waste collection region 20.<br><br>
The central waste material collection region 20 is in the form a cupola which is inverted in a mid-portion of the support body 12.<br>
The collection region 20 is configured to have a shape which complements the aperture in the disc 14, such that, in assembly, as the disc 14 turns the waste material on the surface of the disc can eventually reach the cupola.<br>
The cupola is configured to detachably support a receptacle unit therein.<br>
Figure 4 shows the disc 14 having two flat surfaces 16.1 and 16.2 which are arranged in a declining stepped relation such that the disc 14 is defined by a set of descending stages, which stages are joined to one another.<br>
Figure 5 shows a plan view of an alternative patterns 44 that can be defined on an inner surface of the support body 12. A set of ribs 12.1 are shown arranged uniformly along the outer surface of the support body 12.<br>
Figure 6 and 7 show partial cross-sections of the shell 10 in which : the walls of the central waste collection 20 have an uneven pattern.<br>
Figure 8 is a plan view of the shell 10 further illustrating the alternative arrangement of the location of the ventilation unit 34 as relative to the access aperture 38 compared in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 9 is a three-dimensional projection of the assembled waste disposal device in the form of a shell.<br>
Figure 10 is an alternative arrangement of the ratchet-like formation as described hereinbefore. In Figure 10 the actuator 30 is in the form of a recoilable shuttle 56 which is connected to an operating handle 46.<br>
The recoilable shuttle 56 has a cable 48 which connects the shuttle 56 and a pawl 52 to the operating handle 46; the pawl 52 being engaged to the angled teeth 42 of the disc 14.<br><br>
The shuttle 56 is also connected to a spring 50, one end of which is supported on the support body 12.<br>
The pawl 52 is in the form of a hook member, said hook member being configured to engage the angled teeth 42.<br>
In use, an application of a pulling force on the operating handle 46 pulls the cable 48 thereby causing the pawl 52 to shift from one angled tooth 42 to another whilst. simultaneously, the spring 50 provides an opposing pulling force to return the pawl 52 to its original position upon release of the operating handle 46. (The spring could be provided on the other side and provide a pushing force).- In general a waste disposal device according to this invention is suitable for disposal of a variety of waste material, including human and animal excrement, domestic, agricultural, medical and/or industrial waste material- and products.<br>
For example, the device is suitable for use as a waterless toilet system, in one instance, whereas it can also be suitable for disposal of hazardous medical waste material and products such as HIV blood infested waste medical clothing and instruments like syringes.<br>
Typically a user of this shell shaped disposal device 10 deposits the waste material through a chute 26 such that the material settles on a ring shaped flat surface 16 of disc 14. By means of an actuator 30 (see figures 1 and 2, or 46 in figures 10 and 1 I) which is adapted to be in a ratchet-like relationship with the disc 14, said actuator 30 being positioned in close proximity with the chute 26, the user is able to turn the disc 14 on a support body 12 thereby causing the waste material to be carried around on the flat surface 16.<br>
As more waste material is being deposited and the disc 14 is repeatedly being turned with each deposit of waste material ; the waste material collect and pile against a deflector 22 which is fixedly mounted in contact with the surface 16 of the disc 14. The deflector, which is oriented to be at an obtuse angle relative to an outer edge of the surface of the disc 14, causes the piled waste material to be deflected into a waste collection region 20.<br><br>
In the instance where the disc has two flat surfaces 16.1 an 16.2, the piled waste material is deflected by an outer deflector 22.1 from an uppermost flat surface 16.1 onto a lower surface 16.2 prior to being deflected by an inner deflector 22.2 into collection 20. Correspondingly each surface has a separate deflector associated therewith.<br>
A receptacle unit for collecting the waste material deposits is detachably supported within the collection region 20 so that the deflected waste material is collected therein. An access aperture 38 is defined above a cover portion 24 of device, to provide the user with access to collection region 20 for the removal of collected waste material in the receptacle unit and place a new receptacle unit-in the collection region.<br>
A ventilation unit which comprises a conduit, a vent pipe 34 and an extraction fan 36 creates an air flow which desirably provides a drying effect and removes bacteria, air-borne microscopic germs and other harmful elements including a bad smell that is generated by the waste material deposits within the device.<br>
The waste disposal device is suitable for use in the form herein described and illustrated in diagrams, or it can be mounted onto any suitable surface. If the shell 10 is to be used for disposal of human excrement then conveniently the shell 10 is anchored into a dug-out hole. The ribs 12.1 provide rigidity for the body 12 of the shell. The top surface of the shell is exposed.<br><br>
