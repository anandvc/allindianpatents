				<td>BEFORE CONTROLLER OF PATENTS THE PATENT OFFICE, DELHI<br>
THE PATENTS ACT 1970 (Section 15)<br>
In the matter of application No.942/DELNP/2006 Dated 22nd February 2006 filed by Signature R &amp; D Holdings LLC A US Company<br>
Hearing held on 2nd February 2009 at 11:30 A.M.<br>
Presents in the hearing:<br>
1.	Mr. Sharad Vadhera	Attorney representing the applicant<br>
2.	Mr. Afzal Hasan	Agent representing the applicant<br>
3.	Ms. Preeti Sharma	Agent representing the applicant<br>
4.	Dr.Jyoti Verma	Examiner of Patents 8B Designs<br>
ORDER<br>
M/S Signature R 8B D Holdings LLC, a US company, of 800 W.Renner Road, Suite 1722, Richardson, TX 78080, United States of America, through their patent attorneys M/S Kan 8B Krishme filed a patent application No. 942/DELNP/2006 on 22nd February 2006 for their invention titled "Amino Acid Prodrugs" claiming therein a method for enhancing at least two of the therapeutic qualities of a drug having a functionality group selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino, carboxy or acylating derivatives of said carboxy group. The applicants have also claimed the priority date of US application No 60/491,331 dated 29-07-2003 and international application No PCT/US2004/024901 Dated 29-07-2004.<br>
2. On the receipt of request for examination on 5th June 2006, this application was examined by the Patent Office and First Examination Report (FER) thereof was issued on 11th January 2008 vide this office letter No. 942/DELNP/2006/8815. The examination report inter-alia contained the objections relating to lack of novelty and inventive step u/s 2(l)(j) of the Patents Act 1970 in view of citations cited in ISR and IPER , not patentable within the provisions of clause (d), (e) and (i) of Section 3 of Patents Act 1970 as amended in 2005 and also the objection of plurality and multiplicity of inventions u/s 10(5).<br><br>
3.	The agents for the applicant responded to the objections contained in First Examination Report on 31st December 2008 and resubmitted the documents. In their submissions they stated that their claims are novel and inventive over prior art and the present subject matter gives the surprising effect, that L-Threonine can separate racemic mixtures of drug molecules into their pure enantiomers. Normally such separations are effected with heroic methods of synthesis, chromatography, fermentation with microbes or using special bioenzymes. They also submitted that the applicant has found that when the racemate drug was reacted with L-Threonine to form an ester, the two enantiomeric esters had different physicochemical characteristics. The inventor also noted that only L-threonine can separate the racemic mixtures of the drugs and similar OH containing other amino acids such as L-Serine, L-hydroxyproline or other hydroxyl amino acids didn't have the same effectiveness as L-Threonine. They also submitted their derivatives are not "Prodrugs" but "Novel compounds with high therapeutic index". The inventor found that L-Threonine ester of the active drug exhibited better efficacy than the parent drug and had better pharmacological profile. With their experiments they concluded that the derivatives of the present invention for a number of drugs are not prodrugs, have intact activity, better efficacy and less toxicity resulting in improved therapeutic index. Regarding the objection of section 3(d), the applicant submitted that the present subject matter have improved therapeutic index by increasing the efficacy but at the same time decreasing the toxicity with the help of L-threonine. Regarding the objection of section 3(i), the applicant submitted that the present subject matter relates to a method for enhancing the therapeutic qualities and not related to a method of treatment. Regarding the objection of section 3(e), the applicant submitted that the applicant are claiming a method for enhancing the therapeutic qualities not a composition and therefore section 3(e) is not applicable. No submission was given for the objection of plurality of distinct invention and multiplicity of invention u/s 10(5). The application was examined again considering the submissions filed by the agent. But the examiner was not satisfied with the submissions as the specification did not contain any comparative data which could support the applicant's submission and issued a subsequent examination report on 09th January 2009.<br>
4.	The agents for the applicant again responded on 12th January 2009 to the objections contained in subsequent examination report dated 09th January 2009. The submissions were exactly the same as filed on 31st December 2008. However, the examiner was not satisfied with the submissions and matter was discussed in detail with the agent on 12th January 2009 which happened to be the last date to put the application in<br><br>
order for grant under section 21(1) of the Act. Therefore the agent requested for an opportunity to be heard before the controller under section 14 of Patents Act 2005. Accordingly a hearing was fixed on 02nd February 2009 at 11:30AM and matter was heard. Subsequent to the said hearing the agents also gave written submissions and filed the amended claims on 03rd February 2009 restricted them to 6 that too for method claims and deleted all the product claims.<br>
5.	The agent in their written submission dated 02nd February 2009 gave all<br>
the comparative data with respect to prior art. Improved efficacy data was<br>
also provided with respect to the objection relating to section 3(d). In the<br>
amended set of claims filed on 03rd February 2009, the claims relating the<br>
plurality of distinct inventions and the claims falling under the purview of<br>
section 10(5) were deleted.<br>
6.	The Examiner was directed to examine the submissions and amended<br>
claims and accordingly the amended claims, comparative data and the<br>
submissions of the agents made during hearing have been examined. The<br>
agents have also given the comparison between the features of the alleged<br>
invention and the prior art in order to prove that the present invention is<br>
novel and involves inventive step over the prior art. In view of such<br>
comparative data and amendments made in claims, the examiner is of the<br>
view that the objections communicated by this office on 9th January 2009<br>
have been complied with. I have also considered the same after exercising<br>
the powers contained under section 15 of the Act and I fully agree with the<br>
observations made by the examiner.<br>
Having considered all the facts, submission made by the agent for the applicant during the hearing and as well as all the documents on record and also in view of my above findings, I hereby order this application to proceed further for grant of patent only with the 6(six) amended sets of claims relating to the method for enhancing the therapeutic qualities such as improvement insolubility reducing toxicity and improving of crossing blood brain barrier and increasing the therapeutic index of a drug in accordance with the provisions of the Patents Act 1970.<br><br><br>
fact, they exhibit preferably at least two of the improved qualities cited hereinabove. Other advantages of the prodrug include the wide availability of the amino acids and the ease in which the reactions take place. The reaction to form the amide is generally efficient and yield are very high, presumably above about 70% and more preferably above about 80% and most preferably above about 90%.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it relates to a method for enhancing the therapeutic qualities such as improvement in solubility, dose proportionality, reducing toxicity and improving of crossing blood brain barrier and increasing the therapeutic index of a drug, comprising: selecting the drugs having at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino, carboxy or acylating derivatives of said carboxy group reacting the said drug of step(i) with a naturally occurring a-L-amino acid having at least two functional groups selected from amino , carboxy and hydroxyl under conventional conditions with the specific the specific ratio of the drug to amino acid being 1:1 allowing the drug and the amino acid in step (ii) to form a covalent bond between them; said amino acid being Thr, Hyp, Ser, Tyr, Lys, Leu, He, Gly, Asp, Glu, Met, Ala, Val, Pro, His, Nor, Arg, Phe, Trp, Hsr, Car, Ort, Cys, Cav, Asn, Gin, Can, Tau, Djk, GABA, Dcy and Sar<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
As used here, the term "drug", "medicament", and "pharmaceutical" are being used interchangeably and refer to the active compound that is administered to the patient without attachment of the amino acid thereto. Moreover, as used herein, the drug contains a functional group thereon capable of reacting with the amino acid, such as NHi, OH, COOH or acylating derivatives thereof (e.g., ester, anhydride, amide, and the like) and the like. When the drug is linked to an amino acid, the term "amino acid prodrug" or "prodrug of the present invention" or synonym thereto is utilized.<br>
Among the amino acids useful as promoieties (i.e., reacting with the drugs) are those containing the free amino and/or carboxylic acid groups of all conventional amino acids. Of those, some preferred embodiments include those amino acids having relatively high solubility in aqueous media, for example, in deionized water at unbuffered aqueous solution at 25°C, of at least 100 g/L, and more preferably, at least 250 g/L, and even more preferably at least 500 g/L. For example, glycine and proline have solubilities in deionized water at 25°C of approximately 250 g/L and 1620 g/L, respectively.<br>
Other amino acids useful as promoieties are those containing basic amino side chains, such as lysine. For example, lysine has solubility in deionized water at 25 °C of approximately 700 g/L.<br>
Among other amino acids useful as promoieties are those containing hydroxyl side chains, such as hydroxyproline, serine, and threonine. For example, threonine, hydroxyproline and serine have solubilities in deionized water at 25°C of approximately 100 g/L, 369 g/L and 420 g/L, respectively.<br>
Other preferred embodiments include those amino acids with relatively low solubility in aqueous media, for example, in deionized water at 25°C of at most 10 g/L, or for example, at most 2 g/L, or for example at most 0.6 g/L. For example, the solubility of tyrosine in deionized water at 25°C is approximately 0.5 g/L. Such prodrugs could be used to produce formulations with extended release characteristics, due to the limited solubility of the prodrugs.<br>
Among other amino acids useful as promoieties are those containing carboxylic acid side chains, such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Other amino acids useful as promoieties are the non-essential amino acids, and the non-naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
The following reaction schemes depict the reactions discussed hereinabove with respect to reaction of hydroxyl, carboxyl and amine containing drugs with various amino acids. In the schemes below, R is the drug less the functional OH, COOH or NH2 group<br><br>
whichever is present, and R1 is	<br>
wherein R0 is the side chain of the amino acid listed hereinbelow:<br>

Drug	Amino Acid	Amino Acid Azo Prodrug<br>
Reaction Scheme F: Where the carboxyl group of the drug is reacted with amine group of the amino acid to form the amide prodrug.<br>
R-COOH   +   NH2-R1-COOH     -»     R-(C=O)NH-R1 COOH<br>
Drug	Amino Acid	Amino Acid Amide Prodrug<br>
In the above schemes A-F, the preferred amino acids used are shown hereinbelow: (Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
As used herein the term "amino acid" refers to an organic compound having therein a carboxyl group (COOH) and an amino group (NH2) or salts thereof. In solution, these two terminal groups ionize to form a double ionized, through overall neutral entity identified as zwitterions. The amine donates an electron to the carboxyl group and the<br>
ionic ends are stabilized in aqueous solution by polar water molecules.<br>
It is the side groups that distinguish the amino acids from each other. Some amino acids, such as lysine, have amino groups on the side chain; other amino acids have side chains containing hydroxy groups, such as threonine, serine, hydroxyproline, and tyrosine; some amino acids have carboxy groups on the side chain, such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid. These functional groups on the side chain also can form a covalent bond with the drug, such as esters, amides, and the like. When these side groups become involved in these linkages, such as hydroxy group, the bond may be depicted as OAA, wherein AA is an amino acid residue having a side chain with a hydroxy group, but without the hydroxy group. Thus, AA by this definition, refers to the amino acid without the hydroxy side group since it took part in the reaction in forming the ester. Moreover, when an ester is formed between the hydroxy group of the amino acid and the OH group of the drug, the hydroxy group on the carboxy group forms a byproduct with the hydrogen of the hydroxy group, thus, the resulting product does not have the OH group on the carboxy group, but just the acyl moiety. When the bond is depicted as C(=O)-NHAA, this means that the amino acid forms as an amide bond between the carboxy group on the drug and the amino group of the amino acid. However, as written, since the NH from the amide bond comes from the amino acid, AA is the amino acid without the amino group.<br>
The preferred amino acids are the naturally occurring amino acids. It is more preferred that the amino acids are the V-amino acids. It is also preferred that the amino acids are in the L-configuration. The preferred amino acids include the twenty essential amino acids. The preferred amino acids are Lysine (Lys), Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (He), Glycine (Gly), Aspartic Acid (Asp), Glutamic Acid (Glu), Methionine (Met), Alanine (Ala), Valine (Val), Proline (Pro), Histidine (His), Tyrosine (Tyr), Serine (Ser), Norleucine (Nor), Arginine (Arg), Phenylalanine (Phe), Tryptophan (Trp), Hydroxyproline (Hyp), Homoserine (Hsr), Carnitine (Car), Ornithine (Ort), Canavanine (Cav), Asparagine (Asn), Glutamine (Gin), Carnosine (Can), Taurine (Tau), djenkolic Acid (Djk), y-aminobutyric Acid (GABA), Cysteine (Cys) Cystine (Dcy), Sarcosine<br>
(Sar), Threonine (Thr) and the like. The even more preferred amino acids are the twenty essential amino acids, Lys, Leu, Ile, Gly, Asp, Glu, Met, Ala, Val, Pro, His, Tyr, Thr, Arg, Phe, Trp, Gin, Asn, Cys and Ser.<br>
The prodrugs are prepared from a drug having a group thereon which can react with the amino acid.<br>

The prodrug of the present invention contains amino groups and as such are basic in nature. They are capable of forming a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various inorganic and organic acids. These acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, formate, acetate, citrate, tartate, lactate, and the like.<br>
As indicated herein, in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a prodrug wherein the prodrug comprises a drug, e.g., cyclosporine and an amino acid esterified to the MeBmt (x-y=CH=CH) or dihydro MeBmt moiety, (x-y=CH2CH2). The amino acid is attached to the cyclosporine and to the other other drugs by a covalent bond.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are prepared by art recognized techniques. For examples, if the drug contains an OH group, said as cyclosporin, then an amino acid or an acylating derivatives thereof, such as the acid halide, e.g., amino acid fluoride, amino acid chloride, or an amino acid alkyl ester wherein alkyl group contains 1 -6 carbon atoms is reacted with the carboxy group of the drug, e.g., cyclosporine under esterification condition. Preferably, the reaction is conducted in the presence of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like. Alternatively, as described hereinabove, if the drug has an amino group thereon, then the amino acid may be reacted with the drug under amide forming conditions to form an amide as the covalent bond. Or if the drug has a carboxy group or acylating derivative thereon, it may be reacted with the amino group of the amino acid to form an amide under amide forming conditions to form an amide bond between the amino acid and the drug. Additionally if the drug has a carboxy group therein, the hydroxy group of the side chain of the amino acid may be reacted with the carboxy group or acylating derivative, therein under esterification conditions to form the ester linkage between the amino acid and the drug, as described hereinabove.<br><br>
If the amino acid has a group thereon which is reactive under the reaction conditions it is protected by a protecting group known in the art. After the completion of the reaction, the protecting group is removed. Examples of protecting groups that could he used are described in the book entitled, "Protective Group in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora W. Greene, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
For example, if amino acids with carboxylic groups in their side chains, for example, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, are used in the aforementioned synthesis, these will generally require protection of the side chain carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups can be esters, such as cyclohexyl esters, t-butyl esters, benzyl esters, allyl esters, 9-fluorophenyl-methyl groups or adamantyl groups, such as 1-or 2-adamantyl which can be protected after the esterfication reaction is completed using techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
If amino acids with hydroxyl groups in their side chains, for example, serine, threonine, hydroxyproline, and the like and amino acids with phenolic groups in their side chains, for example, tyrosine, and the like are used in the aforementioned esterification, reaction, they will desirably require protection of the chain hydroxyl or phenolic group. Suitable for protecting groups for the hydroxyl side chain groups can be ethers, such as benzyl ether or t-butyl ether. Removal of the benzyl ether can be effected by liquid hydrogen fluoride, while the t-butyl ether can be removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. Suitable protecting groups for phenolic side chain groups can be ethers, as above, including benzyl or t-butyl ether or 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, 2,4-dintrophenyl and the like.<br>
Moreover, the products can be purified to be made substantially pure by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as by chromatography, e.g., HPLC, crystallization and the like. By substantially "pure" it is meant that the product contains no more than about 10% impurity therein.<br><br>
The prodrugs can be made into pharmaceutical compositions including prodrugs of, or pharmaceutical acceptable salts, pharmaceutical acceptable solvates, esters, enantiomers, diastereomers, N-Oxides, polymorphs, thereof, as described herein, along with a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier, and optionally but desirably pharmaceutically acceptable excipients using techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The prodrugs utilized in the present method are used in therapeutically effective amounts.<br>
The physician will determine the dosage of the prodrugs of the present invention which will be most suitable and it will vary with the form of administration and the particular compound chosen, and furthermore, it will vary depending upon various factors, including but not limited to the patient under treatment and the age of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated and the like and the identify of the prodrug administered. He will generally wish to initiate treatment with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound and increase the dosage by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. It will generally be found that when the composition is administered orally, larger quantities of the active agent will be required to produce the same effect as a smaller quantity given parenterally. The compounds are useful in the same manner as the corresponding drug in the non-prolong form and the dosage level is of the same order of magnitude as is generally employed with these other therapeutic agents. When given parenterally, the compounds are administered generally in dosages of, for example, about 0.001 to about 10,000 mg/kg/day, also depending upon the host and the severity of the condition being treated and the compound utilized.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compounds utilized are orally administered in amounts ranging from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, depending upon the particular mammalian host or the disease to be treated, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg body weight per day. This dosage<br><br>
regimen may be adjusted by the physician to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
The prodrug may be administered in any convenient manner, such as by oral, intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes.<br>
The prodrug may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly into the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the prodrug may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 1% of the prodrug. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the unit. The amount of the prodrug used in such therapeutic compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to the present invention contain between about 200 mg and about 4000 mg of prodrug. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: A binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such<br><br>
as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations. For example, sustained release dosage forms are contemplated wherein the active ingredient is bound to an ion exchange resin which, optionally, can be coated with a diffusion barrier coating to modify the release properties of the resin or wherein the prodrug of the present invention is associated with a sustained release polymer known in the art, such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and the like.<br>
The prodrug may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, e.g., PEG 100, PEG 200, PEG 300, PEG 400, and the like, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form is usually sterile and must be fluid to the extent that syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and usually must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and one or more liquid polyethylene glycol, e.g. as disclosed herein and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.   The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to<br><br>
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the prodrug in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders, the above solutions are vacuum dried or freeze-dried, as necessary.<br>
The prodrug can also be applied topically, as e.g., through a patch using techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The prodrug can be administered buccally by preparing a suitable formulation of the prodrug of the present invention and utilizing procedures well known to those skilled in the art. These formulations are prepared with suitable non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of buccal dosage forms. Some of these ingredients can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the buccal dosage form desired, e.g., tablets, lozenges, gels, patches and the like. All of these buccal dosage forms are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention and they are formulated in a conventional manner.<br>
The formulation of the pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared using conventional methods using one or more physiologically and/or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. Thus, the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates may be formulated for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose) or oral, buccal, parenteral, or rectal administration. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the<br><br>
form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (for example, pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers (for example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (for example, potato starch, or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups, or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicles before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol syrup, corn syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible oils and fats); emulsifying agents (for example, lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (for example, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active prodrug.<br>
The prodrug of the present invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, for example, by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, for example, in ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspension, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the prodrug may be in the powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, for example, sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br><br>
The prodrugs of the present invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, for example, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the prodrug of the present invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the prodrugs may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the prodrugs of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredients. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
In tablet form, it is desirable to include a lubricant which facilitates the process of manufacturing the dosage units; lubricants may also optimize erosion rate and drug flux. If a lubricant is present, it will be present on the order of 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. %, preferably about 0.01 wt. % to 0.5 wt, %, of the dosage unit. Suitable lubricants include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearylfumarate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oils and polyethylene glycol. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, modulating the particle size of the components in the dosage unit and/or the density of the unit can provide a similar effect-- i.e., improved manufacturability and optimization of erosion rate and drug flux-without addition of a lubricant.<br><br>
Other components may also optionally be incorporated into the dosage unit. Such additional optional components include, for example, one or more disintegrants, diluents, binders, enhancers, or the like. Examples of disintegrants that may be used include, but are not limited to, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidones, such as crospovidone (e.g., Polyplasdone® XL, which maybe obtained from GAP), cross-linked carboxylic methylcelluloses, such as croscanmelose (e.g., Ac-di-sol®, which may be obtained from FMC), alginic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl starches (e.g., Explotab®, which may be obtained from Edward Medell Co., Inc.), agar bentonite and alginic acid. Suitable diluents are those which are generally useful in pharmaceutical formulations prepared using compression techniques, e.g., dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (e.g., Di-Tab®, which may be obtained from Stauffer), sugars that have been processed by crystallization with dextrin (e.g., co-crystallized sucrose and dextrin such as Di-Pak®, which may be obtained from Amstar), calcium phosphate, cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, dry starch, powdered sugar and the like. Binders, if used, are those that enhance adhesion. Examples of such binders include, but are not limited to, starch, gelatin and sugars such as sucrose, dextrose, molasses, and lactose. Permeation enhancers may also be present in the novel dosage units in order to increase the rate at which the active agents pass through the buccal mucosa. Examples of permeation enhancers include, but are not limited to, dimethylsulfoxide ("DMSO"), dimethyl formamide ("DMF"), N,N-dimethylacetamide ("DMA"), decylmethylsulfoxide ("C1oMSO"), polyethylene glycol monolaurate ("PEGML"), glycerol monolaurate, lecithin, the 1-substituted azacycloheptan-2-ones, particularly 1-n-dodecylcyclazacycloheptan-2-one (available under the trademark Azone.RTM. from Nelson Research &amp; Development Co., Irvine, Calif.), lower alkanols (e.g., ethanol), SEP A® (available from Macrochem Co., Lexington, Mass.), cholic acid, taurocholic acid, bile salt type enhancers, and surfactants such as Tergitol®, Nonoxynol-9® and TWEEN-80®.<br>
Flavorings may be optionally included in the various pharmaceutical formulations. Any suitable flavoring may be used, e.g., mannitol, lactose or artificial sweeteners such as<br><br>
aspartame. Coloring agents may be added, although again, such agents are not required. Examples of coloring agents include any of the water soluble FD&amp;C dyes, mixtures of the same, or their corresponding lakes.<br>
In addition, if desired, the present dosage units may be formulated with one or more preservatives or bacteriostatic agents, e.g., methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, chlorocresol, benzalkonium chloride, or the like.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents for pharmaceutical active substances well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the prodrug, their use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of prodrug calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
The prodrug is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore described. A unit dosage, for example, contains the principal active compound in amounts ranging from about 10 mg e.g. in humans, or as low as 1 mg (for small animals) to about 2000 mg. If placed in solution, the concentration of the prodrug preferably ranges from about 10 mg/mL to about 250 mg/mL. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients. In the case of buccal administration, the prodrugs are preferably in the buccal unit dosage form present in an amount ranging from about 10 to about 50 mg.<br><br>
The prodrugs of the present invention are effective in treating disease or conditions in which the corresponding drug (without the amino acid prodrug of the present invention) normally are used.<br>
As used herein the term "treating" refers to reversing, alleviating or inhibiting the progress of a disease, disorder or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition, to which such term applies. As used herein, "treating" may also refer to decreasing the probability or incidence of the occurrence of a disease, disorder or condition in a mammal as compared to an untreated control population, or as compared to the same mammal prior to treatment. For example, as used herein, "treating" may refer to preventing a disease, disorder or condition, and may include delaying or preventing the onset of a disease, disorder or condition, or delaying or preventing the symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or condition. As used herein, "treating" may also refer to reducing the severity of a disease, disorder or condition or symptoms associated with such disease, disorder or condition prior to a mammal's affliction with the disease, disorder or condition. Such prevention or reduction of the severity of a disease, disorder or condition prior to affliction relates to the administration of the composition of the present invention, as described herein, to a subject that is not at the time of administration afflicted with the disease, disorder or condition. As used herein "treating" may also refer to preventing the recurrence of a disease, disorder or condition or of one or more symptoms associated with such disease, disorder or condition. The terms "treatment" and "therapeutically," as used herein, refer to the act of treating, as "treating" is defined above.<br>
As used herein the term "patient" or "subject" refers to a warm blooded animal, and preferably mammals, such as, for example, cats, dogs, horses, cows, pigs, mice, rats and primates, including humans. The preferred patient is humans.<br><br>
The prodrugs of the present invention exhibit the same utility as the corresponding drug without the amino acid linkage. The prodrug exhibits an enhanced therapeutic quality. That is, they exhibit at least one and more preferably at least two enhanced therapeutic qualities relative to the drug which has not been transformed to the prodrug of the present invention prior to administration. These include, but are not limited to<br>
a.	Improved taste, smell<br>
b.	Desired octanol/water partition coefficient (i.e., solubility in water/fat)<br>
The various amino acids have different solubility in aqueous solutions. By selecting a particular amino acid, the octanol water partition coefficient can be affected. For example, many drugs in the following list are highly hydrophobic. The amino acids are highly hydrophilic. For example, assume propofol is the drug and lysine is the amino acid. Propofol is completely insoluble in water, while lysine is soluble to the extent of 700 mg/ml. When these two diverse molecules are esterified via an ester bond, the resulting lysine ester of propfol has a solubility in water in excess of 250 mg/ml.<br>
On the other hand, cromolyn sodium is highly water soluble. For all practical purpose, il is not absorbed when administered orally. By affecting its water solubility one could improve absorption. In this case, one would look for conditions opposite to that of propofol, i.e., the goal is to decrease water solubility. By choosing apporoprieate low water soluble amino acids, such as tyrosine, one can achieve proper hydrophilic/lipophilic balance.<br>
c.	Improved stability in-vitro and in-vivo<br>
d.	Enhanced penetration of blood-brain barrier<br>
e.	Elimination of first-pass effect in liver, i.e., the drug not metabolized in liver and<br>
therefore more drug in system circulation<br>
f.	Reduction of entero-hepatic recirculation (this improves bio-availability)<br>
g.	Painless injections with parenteral formulations<br>
h.   Improved bio-availability<br>
i.    Improved changes in the rate of absorption (increase vs lack thereof)<br><br>
j.    Reduced side effects k.   Dose proportionality<br>
A dose proportionality claim requires that when the drug is administered in escalating doses, proportionally escalating amounts of active drug is delivered into the blood stream. This is measured by determining the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve obtained after administering a drug via any route other than IV route and measuring the same in plasma/blood. A simple mathematical procedure is as follows: For example, a drug is administered at e.g., 3 different doses, 10, 100 and 1000 mg, orally to a patient, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) is measured. Then each total AUC is divided by the dose, and the result should be the same for all three doses. If it is the case, then there is dose proportionality. Lack of dose proportionality indicates any one or more of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacological mechanisms are saturable, including absorption, metabolism or the number of receptor sites available for pharmacological response.<br>
For example in the above study, assume the AUC values of 100, 1000 and 10,000 are obtained, in this case the dose proportionality is inappropriate. When there is lack of dose proportionality, there is either more or less amount of drug in the plasma, depending upon which mechanism is saturable. The following are the possibilities: Saturable Absorption. If this is the case, as the dose is increased, proportionally less and less of the drug is absorbed, hence overall AUC will decrease as the dose is increased.<br>
Saturable metabolism of elimination. If thus is the case, then more and more of the drug will be circulating in the blood, and the AUC will increase with increasing dose.<br>
Saturable pharmacological receptor sites: In this case, since all the receptor sites will eventually be occupied by the drug, any additional drug will not increase the response. Thus, increasing dose will not result in increasing response.<br><br>
Dose proportionality is an excellent response profile, since one can predict accurately the pharmacological response and curative power at all doses. Thus dose proportionality is a desirable quality for any drug. Furthermore, achievement of dose proportionality is also dependent upon the formulation, and fed/fasted differences.<br>
1.    Selective hydrolysis of the prodrug at site of action m. Controlled release properties n.   Targeted drug delivery<br>
0.	Reduction in toxicity, hence, improved therapeutic ratio<br>
p.   Reduced dose<br>
q.   Alteration of metabolic pathway to deliver more drug at the site of action r.   Increased solubility in aqueous solution s.   Enhanced efficacy<br>
Thus, various dosage forms available with amino acid pro-drugs and they are prepared by conventional methods:<br>
1.	Oral liquid dosage (Controlled release and immediate release liquids<br>
containing sugar and sugar free, dye and dye free, alcohol and alcohol free<br>
formulations, including chewable tablets)<br>
ii.	Oral solid dosage (Controlled release and immediate release tablets, capsules<br>
and caplets<br>
iii.	Intravenous (Injections, both ready to use and lyophilized powders)<br>
iv.	Intramuscular (Injections, both ready to use and lyophilized powders)<br>
v.	Subcutaneous (Injections, both ready to use and lyophilized powders)<br>
vi.	Transdermal (Mainly patches)<br>
vii.	Nasal (Sprays, formulations for nebulizer treatments)<br>
viii.	Topical (Creams, ointments)<br>
ix.	Rectal (Creams, ointments and suppositories)<br>
x.	Vaginal (Creams, ointments and pessaries)<br>
xi.	Ocular (Drops and ointments)<br><br>
xii.      Buccal (Chewable and now chewable tables)<br>
Many drugs discussed herein, especially in the table hereinbelow are characteristically highly hydrophobic and readily precipitate in the presence of even very minor amounts of water, e.g., on contact with the body (e.g., stomach fluids). It is accordingly extremely difficult to provide e.g., oral formulations which are acceptable to the patient in terms of form and taste, which are stable on storage and which can be administered on a regular basis to provide suitable and controlling patient dosing.<br>
Proposed liquid formulations, e.g., for oral administration of a number of drugs shown herein in the table have heretofore been based primarily on the use of ethanol and oils or similar excipient as carrier media. Thus, the commercially available drink-solutions of a number of drugs employ ethanol and olive oil or corn oil as carrier medium in conjunction with solvent systems comprising e.g., ethanol and LABRIFIL and equivalent excipient as carrier media. For example, the commercially available Cyclosporin drink solution employs ethanol and olive oil or corn oil as carrier medium in conjunctions with a Labroid as a surfactant. See e.g., U.S. Patent NO. 4,388,307. Use of the drink solution and similar composition as proposed in the art is however accompanied by a variety of difficulties.<br>
Further, the palatability of the known oil based system has proved problematic. The taste of the known drink-solution of several drugs is, in particular, unpleasant. Admixture with an appropriate flavored drink, for example, chocolate drink preparation, at high dilution immediately prior to ingestion has generally been practiced in order to make regular therapy at all acceptable. Adoption of oil-based systems has also required the use of high ethanol concentrations which is itself inherently undesirable, in particular where administration to children is foreseen. In addition, evaporation of the ethanol, e.g., from capsules (adopted in large part, to meet problems of palatability, as discussed or other forms (e.g., when opened)) results in the development of a drug precipitate. Where such compositions are presented in, for example, soft gelatin encapsulated form,<br><br>
this particular difficulty necessitates packaging of the encapsulated product in an airtight component, for example, an air-tight blister or aluminum-foil blister package. This in turn renders the product both bulky and more expensive to produce. The storage characteristics of the aforesaid formulations are, in addition, far from ideal.<br>
Bioavailability levels achieved using existing oral dosage system for a number of drugs described herein are also low and exhibit wide variation between individuals, individual patient types and even for single individuals at different times during the course of therapy. Reports in the literature indicates that currently available therapy employing the commercially available drug drink solution provides an average absolute bioavailability of approximately 10-30% only, with the marked variation between individual groups, e.g., between liver (relatively low bioavailability) and bone-marrow (relatively high bioavailability) transplant recipients. Reported variation in bioavailability between subjects has varied from one or a few percent for some patients, to as much as 90% or more for others. And as already noted, marked change in bioavailability for individuals with time is frequently observed. Thus, there is a need for a more uniform and high bioavailability of a number drugs shown herein in patients.<br>
Use of such dosage forms is also characterized by extreme variation in required patient dosing. To achieve effective therapy, drug blood or blood serum levels have to be maintained within a specified range. This required range can in turn, vary, depending on the particular condition being treated, e.g., whether therapy is to prevent one or more pharmacological actions of a specific drug and when alternative therapy is employed concomitantly with principal therapy. Because of the wide variations in bioavailability levels achieved with conventional dosage forms, daily dosages needed to achieve required blood serum levels will also vary considerably from individual to individual and even for a single individual. For this reason it may be necessary to monitor blood/blood-serum levels of patients receiving drug therapy at regular and frequent intervals. Monitoring of blood/blood-serum levels has to be carried out on a regular<br><br>
basis. This is inevitably time consuming and inconvenient and adds substantially to the overall cost of therapy.<br>
It is also the case that blood/blood serum levels of a number of drugs described herein achieved using available dosage systems exhibit extreme variation between peak and trough levels. That is for each patient, effective drug levels in the blood vary widely between administrations of individual dosages.<br>
There is also a need for providing a number of drugs described herein, especially the beta-lactum antibiotics, Cyclosporin, cephalosporins, steroids, quinolone antibiotics and Cyclosporin, in a water-soluble form for injection. It is well known that Cremaphore L® (CreL) used in current formulations of a number of drugs described hereinbelow is a polyoxyethylated derivative of castor oil and is a toxic vehicle. There have been a number of incidences of anaphylaxis due to the castor oil component. At present there is no formulation that would allow many of these drugs to be in aqueous solution at the concentrations needed due to poor water solubility of the drug.<br>
Beyond all these very evident practical difficulties lies the occurrence of undesirable side reactions already alluded to, observed employing available oral dosage forms.<br>
Several proposals to meet these various problems have been suggested in the art, including both solid and liquid oral dosage forms. An overriding difficulty which has however remained is the inherent insolubility of the several of the drugs shown in the table hereinbelow in aqueous media, hence preventing the use of a dosage form which can contain the drugs in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability, e.g. enabling effective absorption from the stomach or gut lumen and achievement of consistent and appropriately high blood/blood-serum levels.<br><br>
The particular difficulties encountered in relation to oral dosing with these drugs have inevitably led to restrictions in the use of specific drug therapy for the treatment of relatively less severe or endangering disease conditions. For example, taking Cyclosporin as a test drug, a particular area of difficulty in this respect has been the adoption of Cyclosporin therapy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and other conditions affecting the skin, for example for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and, as also widely proposed in the art, for hair growth stimulation, e.g. in the treatment of alopecia due to ageing or disease.<br>
Thus while oral Cyclosporin therapy has shown that the drug is of considerable potential benefit to patients suffering e.g. from psoriasis, the risk of side-reaction following oral therapy has prevented common use. Various proposals have been made in the art for application of Cyclosporins, e.g. Cyclosporin, in topical form and a number of topical delivery systems have been described. Attempts at topical application have however failed to provide any demonstrably effective therapy.<br>
However, the present invention overcomes the problems described hereinabove. More specifically, the prodrug of the present invention significantly enhances its solubility in aqueous solutions relative to the non-prodrug form of the pharmaceutical, thereby avoiding the need to utilize a carrier, such as ethanol or castor oil when administered as a solution. Moreover, the prodrugs of these drugs, in accordance with the present invention, do not exhibit the side effects of the prior art formulations. Further, it has been found that when many of the drugs in the table hereinbelow is administered in its prodrug form in accordance with the present invention, there is enhanced oral absorption, thereby enhancing significantly its bioavailability and its efficacy.<br>

Synthesis of Various Amino Acid Derivatives of Selected Drugs<br>
I. Propofol Derivatives<br>
Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is a low molecular weight phenol which widely used as a central nervous system anesthetic, and posses sedative and hypnotic activities. It is administered intravenously in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and/or sedation in mammals. The major advantages of Propofol are that it can induce anesthesia rapidly, minimal side effects and upon withdrawal, the patient recovers quickly without prolonged sedation.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Propofol has been shown to have a large number of therapeutic applications, which are quite varying and somewhat surprising. For example, it has been shown to be an effective antioxidant, anti-emetic, anti-pruritic, anti-epileptic, anti-inflammatory, and even seems to possess anti-cancer properties.<br>
Mechanism of Action:<br>
The mechanism of action of Propofol has been extensively studied. Its central nervous system anesthetic activity has been shown to be related its high affinity for a specific subclass of GABA receptors (Collins G.G.S., 1988, Br. J. Pharmacology. 542, 225-232). However, there are a number of different receptors in the brain which are substrates for propofol, hence its varied activities.<br>
Propofol also has significant biological effect as an antioxidant. Because of this generalized activity of propofol, it is theoretically useful in the treatment of a number of inflammatory processes where oxidation is an important factor. For example, cyclooxygenase mediated prostaglandin synthesis results in inflammation. By inhibiting oxidation in the respiratory tract, one could use propofol in the treatment of acid aspiration, adult/infant respiratory distress syndrome, airway obstructive diseases, asthma, cancer and a number of other similar pathological conditions.<br>
Since oxidative tissue damage is a very common occurrence, it has been suggested that propofol could be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedrich's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal chord injuries, and various other neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
Propofol is currently available in the US market as an intravenous emulsion marketed by Astra Zenaca under the brand name Diprivan®. It is one the most widely used short acting central nervous system anesthetics in the market. The concentration of propofol is 10 mg/mL in non-pyrogenic sterile emulsion and the formula contains soybean oil, glycerol, egg lecithin, disodium edetate and sodium hydroxide.<br>
A significant disadvantage of Propofol is that it is completely insoluble in water. Even at very low concentrations of 10 mg/mL, the drug precipitates out of an aqueous solution in room temperature. Therefore, manufacturers of this formulation use heroic methods to emulsify this product in water using extraordinarily complex and toxic emulsifying agents. For example, manufacturers of the IV formulations use egg lecithin, Cremaphor L®, castor oil, and other similar emulsifiers.<br>
However, use of such emulsifiers is associated with number of problems. It is well now that various types of Cremaphor L® emulsifiers can precipitate allergic reactions. Egg lecithin and castor oil have been shown to produce anaphylactic shock in some patients. Furthermore, maintenance of stability of propofol in these emulsions is short lived and<br>
more expensive. Moreover, the presence of egg lecithin and castor oil make the emulsion prone to microbial growth. It may be possible to dissolve propofol in water by complexing it with cyclodextrin, but cyclodextrin has not been approved by the FDA for use in intravenous therapy.<br>
Heretofore, no one has made a safe prodrug of propofol. The British patents 1,102,011, and 1,160,468 and US Patent 3,389,138 describe the various phenol esters of amino acids, wherein the propofol is attached to a number of side chains which when released in the body produce toxic effects.<br>
US Patent 6,451,854 describe a number of substituted alpha amino acetic acid esters of propofol, wherein propofol and the side chain were substituted with a number of different chemical groups. All the N,N-disubstiruted glycine esters of propofol have not shown to be non-toxic and there many of the compounds described are derivative of propofol. Thus when released in the body after the cleavage of ester by the enzymes, many of the active drugs released are not propofol, and hence they do not possesses any toxicity data and are entirely new molecules with unknown therapeutic efficacy in man.<br>
In yet another published paper on the water soluble salts of amino acid esters of anesthetic agent propofol, (Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 175[2]: 195-204, 1998) authors have synthesized a number of water soluble derivatives of propofol. However, when these prodrugs are cleaved by esterase enzymes, substituted non-natural amino acids with unknown toxicity profile are released in the body.<br>
Until now there has been no pharmaceutical preparation has been available in the market that can deliver propofol without harmful side effects. The present invention however, has produced a number of water soluble, non-toxic derivatives of propofol which are suitable for delivering propofol in the body without any harmful side effects and without the needs for toxic and expensive additives, solubilizers and emulsifiers.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a class of prodrugs of Propofol. The prodrug consists of the carboxyl group of an amino acid esterified to the free hydroxyl group present on the propofol molecules.<br>
More specifically, one aspect of the present invention is directed to, the compounds of the formulae<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; wherein AA is an amino acid, in which the carboxyl group of AA is reacted with the hydroxyl group of the Propofol.<br>
In antoher aspect, the present invention is also directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the various Propofol prodrugs above and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a patient in need of propofol therapy, which method comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of the Propofol.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of enhancing the solubility of propofol in an aqueous solution comprising reacting the hydroxyl functionality of the Propofol and isolating the products thereof.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of substantially and in a therapeutically efficacious manner, reducing or eliminating the potential toxic side effects of current formulations containing toxic exepients when<br>
administered to a patient which comprises reacting the hydroxyl functionality of the propofol molecule with carboxyl function of selected amino acids to form an ester covalent bond respectively and isolating the product thereof and administering said product to the patient.<br>
The current invention shows that when unsubstituted naturally occurring amino acids are esterified to propofol, the resulting prodrugs are highly water soluble, (&gt;200 mg/L in water), release non-toxic amino acids upon cleavage in the body and require none of the toxic emulsifier, additives and other exepients.<br>
Furthermore, it has been shown that the current invention also produced drugs, while they are prodrugs of propofol of the present invention are highly effective central nervous system anesthetics. Thus the current amino acid prodrugs are effective central nervous system anesthetics, with or without releasing the active parent drug.<br>
The amino acid esters of the present invention are at least 10 times more soluble that propofol in water in room temperature. Especially the glycine, proline and lysine esters of propofol are soluble at the range of more than 100 mg/ml, and in case of lysine it is greater than 250 mg/mL.<br>
While the prodrugs of the present invention are not expected to possess any antioxidant activity due to blockage of the phenolic group responsible for such; however the present inventor has found that the prodrugs of propofol are effective anesthetics with or without releasing propofol. The propofol prodrugs described release the propofol when administered in vivo and the resulting drug maintains its pharmacological and antioxidant properties.<br>
The prodrug of propofol of the present invention clearly provides a number of advantages over propofol, for example, all of the side chains cleaved from these prodrugs are naturally occurring essential amino acids and hence are non-toxic. This<br>
results in high therapeutic index. Secondly all the prodrugs are readily cleaved in the body to release propofol. Furthermore, due their high water solubility, they can be easily administered by either forming an in-situ solution just before IV administration using lyophilized sterile powder or providing the drug in solution in prefilled syringe or bottles for infusion. The aminoacid esters are more stable than propofol since OH group in propofol is blocked to oxidation. Thus the propofol prodrugs of the present invention are more effective then propofol itself without the toxicity and other pharmaceutical problems associated with current marketed formulations.<br>
The prodrugs of propofol of the present invention possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-convulsive, anti-emetic and anti-pruritic properties.<br>
These prodrugs of propofol of the present invention are effective in treating diseases or conditions in which Propofol normally are used. The prodrugs disclosed herein are transformed within the body to release the active compound and enhances the therapeutic benefits of the Propofol by reducing or eliminating biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers associated with each of them. However it should be noted that these prodrugs themselves will have sufficient activity without releasing any active drug in the mammals. Since the prodrugs are more soluble in water then Propofol, it does not need to be associated with a carrier vehicle, such as alcohol or castor oil which may be toxic or produce unwanted side reactions. Moreover, oral formulations containing the prodrugs of Propofol are absorbed into the blood and are quite effective.<br>
Thus, the prodrug of the present invention enhances the therapeutic benefits by removing biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers of existing drugs.<br>
Furthermore, the prodrugs are easily synthesized in high yields using reagents which are readily and commercially available.<br>
Overview:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the glycine, L-proline, and L-lysine esters of Propofol is depicted hereinbelow. However, these are exemplary and any ammo acid produrugs thereof can be prepared using the following methodology. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. In general, as shown in the following scheme Propofol (10 g) was coupled with the N-Boc protected amino acid (1 equivalent) with l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, hydrochloride (EDC) in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N-dimethyamino)-pyridine (DMAP). The EDC was removed by extraction with water. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration, and concentration the crude protected amino acid ester of Propofol was purified by flash chromatography to generate the protected esters in 50-60% yield. The protecting groups were then removed by stirring the protected esters in diethyl ether saturated with hydrochloric acid (gas) at room temperature. Yields for the deprotection step were generally 60-95%. After filtration and drying the hydrochloride salts of the glycine and L-proline esters of Propofol did not require additional purification. The hydrochloride salt of the L-lysine-Propofol ester was crystallized once from ethanol to remove a trace of mono-protected L-lysine-Propofol ester.<br>

II. PRO DRUGS OF NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs)<br>
The NSAIDs comprise a class of structurally distinctive, carboxylic acid moiety attached to a planar aromatic functionality, Examples include: acetyl salicyclic acid, salicyclic acid, diflunisal, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, carprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, etodolac, tolmetin, ketorolac, diclofenac, and meclofenamate. The NSADIs posess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and anti-clotting activity.<br>
Examples of the chemical structures of this uniques class of compounds showing wide variety of pharmacological activities are shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
NS AIDs are widely used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, management of edema, tissue damage resulting from inflammatory joint diseases and also, effective anti-clotting agents in the treatment of myocardial infraction. A number of the agents also possess antipyretic activity in addition to analgesic and anti-inflammatory action, thus useful in reducing fever.<br>
Some drugs in the above group have also been prescribed for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, acute gout, ankolysing spondylitis, and dysmenorrhea.<br>
Mechanism of Action:<br>
The major mechanism by which the NSAIDs produce their therapeutic effect is via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Specifically NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenases, such as COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, where these two enzymes are responsible for synthesis of prostaglandins. While COX-1 enzyme is important for the regulation of platelet aggregation, regulation of blood flow in kidney and stomach, and regulation of gastric acid secretion, COX-2 enzyme plays an important role in the pain and inflammatory processes. NSAIDs significantly increase clotting time and can be used for prophylaxis of thromboembolism and myocardial infarction.<br>
All NSAIDs are relatively medium to strong organic acids with pKa's in the 3-6 range. Most of them are carboxylic acid derivatives. Acidic group is essential for COX inhibitory activity and in physiological pH, all the NSAIDs are ionized. All of them have quite varying hydrophilic lipophilic balance, and these are functions of their aryl, aromatic and aliphatic side chains and other heterocyclic variations in their structures. Most of the NSAIDs are highly bound to plasma proteins and often competitively replace other drugs which have similar affinity for plasma proteins. Hence concomitant administration of NSAIDs with other therapeutic class must be carefully evaluated to prevent drug interactions. Most of the drugs, due to acidic carboxyl group are metabolized by the mammals via conjugation. The major pathway of metabolic clearance of a number of NSAIDs is glucuronidation followed by renal elimination.<br>
Use of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in the prophylaxis of coronary heart diseases is now well known, and this drug has proved to be a lifesaver for a number of patients with myocardial infarction. Several additional uses have already been documents for aspirin, for example, it was recently reported in the medical journal Lancet (Vol 349, p 1641) that aspirin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with early warning signs of transient ischemic heart attacks. Pre-eclampsia and fetal growth retardation, both caused by blockages of the blood vessels of the placenta, are two of the commonest complications of pregnancy - there are millions of cases of pre-eclampsia in the world each year. In a<br><br>
trial involving more than 9000 women in 16 countries, a daily dose of 60mg aspirin reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia by 13 per cent. (Aspirin Foundation website). Aspirin has also been shown to be effective in some studies to prevent colon cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer in post-menopausal women. Since aspirin can improve blood flow, its usefulness in the treatment of diabetes certain forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease are becoming increasingly clear.<br>
Because of their unique pharmaceutical potential, the NSAIDs have attracted considerable attention in the press. The primary area of clinical investigation for above drugs has been as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, in particular in relation to their application to patients suffering from pain, arthritis, (Rheumatoid and Osteo) other inflammatory reactions, fever and for the prophylaxis of coronary heart diseases. These drugs are also used in the treatment of migraine headache, menstrual syndromes, back pain and gout.<br>
Despite the very major contribution which NSAIDs have made, difficulties have been encountered in providing more effective and convenient means of administration (e.g., galenic formulations, for example, oral dosage form, which are both convenient and for the patient as well as providing appropriate bioavailability and allowing dosaging at an appropriate and controlled dosage rate) as well as the reported occurrence of undesirable side reactions; in particular severe gastric and duodenal ulcers, mucosal erythema, and edema, erosions, perforations, blood in stool, ulcerative colitis have been obvious serious impediments to their wider use or application. The dual injury theory involves NSAID-mediated direct damage, followed by a systemic effect in which prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited. Topical injury may also occur as a result of the biliary excretion of active hepatic metabolites and subsequent duodenogastric reflux. (Arthritis and Rheumatism 1995; 38(1):5-18) The effects are additive; either topical or systemic mechanisms alone are sufficient to produce gastro duodenal mucosal damage.<br><br>
Moreover, the above mentioned NSAIDs are characteristically highly hydrophobic and readily precipitate in the presence of even very minor amounts of water, e.g., on contact with the body (e.g., stomach fluids). It is accordingly extremely difficult to provide e.g., oral formulations which are acceptable to the patient in terms of form and taste, which are stable on storage and which can be administered on a regular basis to provide suitable and controlling patient dosaging.<br>
Proposed liquid formulations, e.g., for oral administration of NSAIDs, have heretofore been based primarily on the use of natural gums, like Xanthan, cellulose, citric acid, and lime flavor etc. See e.g., U.S. Patent NO. 5,780,046. Commercially available NSAIDs drink-solution employs incompatible orange color and berry flavor, citric acid, Xanthan Gum, polysorbate 80, pregelatinized starch, glycerin, sodium benzoate, and additional artificial colors and flavors. Use of the drink solution and similar composition as proposed in the art is however accompanied by a variety of difficulties.<br>
Further, the palatability of the known oil based system has proved problematic. The taste of the known drink-solution is, in particular, unpleasant. Admixture with an appropriate flavored drink, for example, chocolate drink preparation, at high dilution immediately prior to ingestion has generally been practiced in order to make regular therapy at all acceptable. Adoption of oil based systems has also required the use of high ethanol concentrations to itself inherently undesirable, in particular where administration to children is forseen. In addition, evaporation of the ethanol, e.g., from capsules (adopted in large part, to meet problems of palatability, as discussed or other forms (e.g., when opened) results in the development of a NSAID precipitate. Where such compositions are presented in, for example, soft gelatin encapsulated form; this particular difficulty necessitates packaging of the encapsulated product in an air-tight component, for example, an air-tight blister or aluminum-foil blister package. This in turn renders the product both bulky and more expensive to produce. The storage characteristics of the aforesaid formulations are, in addition, far from ideal.<br><br>
Gastric irritability of the NSAIDs has been a topic of great concern to the practicing physicians and as well as patients. Acute uses of aspirin, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, indomethacin, ketorolac, meclofenamate, mefanamic acid, and piroxicam produce serious GI side effects. Even Ibuprofen is shown to cause severe gastric lesions upon long term use. Gastrointestinal toxicity is the most frequently encountered side effect associated with NSAIDs and presents considerable concern. Approximately one half of all hospital admissions for a bleeding ulcer are attributed to the use of NSAIDs, aspirin, or the two taken in combination during the week prior to admission. (Faulkner G, Prichard P, Somerville K, et al. Aspirin and bleeding peptic ulcers in the elderly. Br Med J. 1988; 297:1311-1313). A survey of Tennessee Medicaid patients who were hospitalized with GI complications showed that patients who used NSAIDs had approximately a fourfold greater risk for developing GI hemorrhage or peptic ulcer disease than patients not taking NSAIDs. (Griffin MR, Piper JM, Daugherty JR, et al. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and increased risk for peptic ulcer disease in elderly persons. Ann Intern Med. 1991; 114:257-263). Serious GI events, according to the FDA, occur in as many as 2% to 4% of patients per year who are taking continuous NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The relative risk of gastric ulcer (4.725), duodenal ulcer (1.1 to 1.6), bleeding (3.8), perforation, and death are all increased by NSAID use when such patients are compared to those who do not take these products. In 1989, patients with rheumatoid arthritis had approximately 20,000 hospitalizations per year with an estimated cost of $10,000 per stay. (Fries JF, Miller SR, Spitz PW, et al. Toward an epidemiology of gastropathy associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. J Gastroenterology. 1989; 96:647-655).<br>
There is also a need for providing some of the NSAIDs in a water soluble form for injection. It is well known that high concentrations of alcohol and tromethamine used to form a salt in the current formulations of Ketorolac are toxic. At present there is no formulation that would allow the NSAIDs to be in aqueous solution at the concentrations needed due to poor water solubility of the drug.<br><br>
Beyond all these very evident practical difficulties lies the occurrence of undesirable side reactions already alluded to, observed employing available oral dosage forms.<br>
Several proposals to meet these various problems have been suggested in the art, including both solid and liquid oral dosage forms. An overriding difficulty which has however remained is the inherent insolubility of the NSAIDs in aqueous media, hence preventing the use of a dosage form which can contain NSAIDs in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability, e.g. enabling effective resorption from the stomach or gut lumen and achievement of consistent and appropriately high blood/blood-serum levels.<br>
The present prodrugs of NSAIDs overcome the problems described hereinabove. More specifically, an embodiment of the present invention is directed to a prodrug of NSAID which significantly enhances its solubility in aqueous solutions, thereby avoiding the need to utilize a carrier, such as ethanol or castor oil when administered as a solution. Moreover, the prodrugs of NSAID, in accordance with the present invention, do not exhibit the side effects of the prior art formulations. Furtherr the prodrugs of the present invention are almost completely devoid of gastric irritability upon oral administration, thereby enhancing significantly the therapeutic index of the prodrugs tested and their efficacy.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a prodrug of NSAIDs. The preferred prodrugs of the NSAIDs have the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; wherein Y is either NH-AA or O-AA and AA is an ammo acid, in which either an amine group or the hydroxyl group of AA is reacted with the carboxylic acid group of the NSAIDs.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the various NSAIDs above and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a patient in need of NSAID therapy, which method comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of the NSAIDs.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of enhancing the solubility of NSAID in an aqueous solution comprising reacting the carboxyl functionality of each of the NSAIDs and isolating the products thereof.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of substantially and in a therapeutically efficacious manner, reducing or eliminating the gastric mucosal damage of NSAIDs when administered to a patient which comprises reacting the carboxyl functionality of each of the NSAID molecule with either amine or hydroxyl function of selected amino acids to form either an amide or ester covalent bond respectively and isolating the product thereof and administering said product to the patient.<br>
A. Synthesis of Ibuprofen Amino Acid Derivaties Overview:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of Ibuprofen is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. Again, these synthetic schemes are exemplary. The scheme is applicable for other amino acids in the preparation of the NSAID prodrugs of the present invention. In general, (±)-Ibuprofen (4-10 g, in batches) was coupled with the N-benzyloxy/benzyl ester protected amino acids (1 equivalent) with l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, hydrochloride (EDC, 1 equivalent) in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N-dimethyamino)-pyridine (DMAP). Once the reactions were complete, any excess EDC was removed by extraction with water, DMAP was removed by extraction with dilute acid, and Ibuprofen was removed by extraction with sodium bicarbonate. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration, and concentration the crude protected amino acid esters<br><br>
of (±)-Ibuprofen were either used directly or purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to generate the protected esters in good yield (85-95%). The column chromatography was generally not necessary if a slight excess of Ibuprofen and coupling agent were used, and a thorough extraction procedure was conducted. The protecting groups were removed by hydrogenation (25-35 psi tb) in the presence of 10% palladium on carbon and hydrochloric acid. Yields for the deprotection step ranged from 70-90%. After filtration and drying the hydrochloride salts of the serine and threonine esters of (±)-Ibuprofen were purified by crystallization. The hydrochloride salt of the L-hydroxyproline-Ibuprofen ester was a gel that would not solidify/crystallize. In this case the hydrogenation was repeated without the use of acid and the neutral compound was purified.<br>
Because the Ibuprofen started as a mixture of enantiomers, the final products were delivered as a mixture of diastereomers except for the threonine ester. In the case of the threonine ester of Ibuprofen, washing with water, acetone or acetonitrile could readily separate the final diastereomeric salts. The insoluble isomer (SPI0016A) was determined to be the active isomer by comparison with an authentic standard prepared from S-(+)-Ibuprofen. The serine and hydroxyproline esters of (±)-Ibuprofen could not be readily separated in this fashion.<br>

(±)-Ibuprofen (5.04 g, 24.4 mmole), N-carbobenzyloxy-L-serine benzyl ester (8.11 g, 24.6 mmole), l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, hydrochloride (EDC, 4.87g, 25.4 mmole), and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP, 0.40 g, 3.27 mmole) were dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL) at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere.   After stirring for 22 hours under an argon atmosphere at room temperature, water (100 mL) was added and the layers were separated. The dichloromethane layer was washed again with water (100 mL) and dried for 1 hour over sodium sulfate (5 g). After filtration and concentration under reduced pressure, the remaining oil was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (250 g), eluting with hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:1). The procedure generated the protected L-serine-(±)-Ibuprofen ester (SPI001501) as a colorless solid (11.4 g, 90% yield).<br>

Gastric mucosal irritation potential of L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of (±)-Ibuprofen in fasted male albino rats<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present study was conducted to determine the relative potential of new formulations of ibuprofen (L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of (+)-Ibuprofen) to cause gastric mucosal irritation/lesions in fasted male albino rats. Ibuprofen (racemic mixture) and Ibuprofen(S)-(+) served as reference controls.<br>
Different new formulations of ibuprofen and ibuprofen (racemic mixture) and ibuprofen(S)-(+) were administered by gavage to fasted male albino rats (Wistar strain), using 5% solution of Tween 80 in milli Q water as the vehicle. The study was conducted at two dose levels viz. 200mg and 300mg/kg body weight along with a vehicle control group. At each dose level 5 animals were used. All the doses were expressed as ibuprofen (racemic mixture) molar equivalents. The doses used as well as the molar equivalents were presented below.<br>

The rats were fasted for a period of 18 to 22 hours before dosing. The test item was administered as a single dose by gavage. Three hours after drug administration, the animals were killed humanely by CO2 gas inhalation. The stomach was dissected out and observed for<br>
•	the quantity of mucous exudate,<br>
•	degree of hyperemia and thickening of stomach wall,<br>
•	hemorrhagic spots (focal or diffuse), nature of hemorrhages (petechial or<br>
ecchymotic) along with the size and<br>
•	perforations or any other lesions<br>
The observations on gastric mucosal irritation of animals of various groups were summarized below<br>
Table 10: Test item: Group: Dose (mg/kg): Observation<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results of the present study showed that none of the formulations of ibuprofen had caused any evidence of irritation of gastric mucosa in fasted male albino rats of male sex at the two dose levels tested (200mg and 300mg/kg body weight). In contrast both ibuprofen (racemic mixture) and ibuprofen (S) - (+) had caused irritation of gastric mucosa at the two dose levels tested. Further ibuprofen(S ) - (+) was found to be more gastric mucosal irritant than ibuprofen (racemic mixture).<br>
Overview Ketoprofen S(+) Threonine Ester Synthesis:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the L-threonine esters of Ketoprofen is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section. This synthesis is exemplary and is equally applicable for the other amino acids. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. In general, (±)-Ketoprofen (5 g) was coupled with N-boc-L-threonine t-butyl ester1 (1 equivalent) with l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, hydrochloride (EDC, 1 equivalent) in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N-dimethyamino)-pyridine (DMAP). Once the reaction was complete, any excess EDC was removed by extraction with water, DMAP was removed by extraction with dilute acid, and Ketoprofen was removed by extraction with sodium bicarbonate. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration, and concentration the crudeprotected L-threonine-(±)-Ketoprofen was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to generate the protected L-threonine ester in good yield (98%). The protecting groups were removed by treatment with 2M hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether to cleave the boc group, followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to remove the t-butyl ester. After drying, the mixture of L-threonine-R,S(±)-Ketoprofen esters was separated by crystallization from acetonitrile. The hydrochloride salt of the L-threonine-S(+)-Ketoprofen ester preferentially precipitated from acetonitrile. A sample of an optically pure standard was prepared starting with S(+)-ketoprofen for comparison. After drying and analysis, a sample of L-threonine-S(+)-Ketoprofen ester, hydrochloride (1.75 g) was separated from the mixture.<br>

Overview:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section and is exemplary for other amino acids. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. In general, acetylsalicyloyl chloride (10 g-25 g, in batches) was coupled with the N-benzyloxy/benzyl ester protected amino acids in the presence of pyridine. Once the reactions were complete (24 to 48 hours at room temperature), the mixture was poured into ice-cold 2N hydrochloric acid. The dichloromethane fraction was then washed with sodium bicarbonate, water and brine. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration, and concentration the crude protected amino acid esters of acetylsalicylic acid were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel. The procedure generated the protected amino acid esters of acetylsalicylic acid in yields ranging from 68% to 95%.

1)	SPIB00102: 2-O-Acetylsalicylic acid (2S, 3R)-(-)-threonine ester A mixture of N-carbobenzyloxy-L-threonine benzyl ester (Z-Thr-OBzl, 21.77 g, 63.40 mmole) and pyridine (25 mL) in anhydrous dichloromethane (500 mL) was cooled in an ice bath while under a nitrogen atmosphere. Acetylsalicyloyl chloride (17.63 g, 88.76 mmole) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight. After 24 hours, the mixture was poured into ice-cold 2N hydrochloric acid (400 mL). After mixing, the layers were separated and the dichloromethane fraction was washed with water (500 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (500 mL), water (500 mL), brine (500 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration, concentration under reduced pressure, and drying under high vacuum, the remaining yellow oil (35. 43 g) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (300 g, 0.035-0.070 mm, 6 nm pore diameter), eluting with hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:1). After concentration of the product containing fractions under reduced pressure and drying under high vacuum until the weight was constant, the experiment produced the protected acetylsalicylic-L-threonine ester SPIB0010201 (28.1 g, 88% yield) as a colorless oil.<br>

Gastric Mucosa irritation potential of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid compared to acetylsalicylic acid:-<br>
The present study was conducted to determine the relative potential of new formulations of aspirin (L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid) to cause gastric mucosal irritation/lesions in fasted male albino rats. Aspirin served as reference control.<br>
Different new formulations of aspirin and aspirin were administered by gavage to fasted male albino rats (Wistar strain), using 0.5% (w/v) Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in Phosphate Buffer (pH 2.6) solution as the vehicle. The study was conducted at two dose levels viz. l00mg and 200mg/kg body weight along with a vehicle control group. At each dose level 5 animals were used. All the doses were expressed as aspirin molar equivalents. The doses used as well as the molar equivalents were presented below.<br>

The rats were fasted for a period of 18 to 22 hours before dosing. The test item was administered as a single dose by gavage. Three hours after drug administration, the animals were killed humanely by CO2 gas inhalation. The stomach was dissected out and observed for<br>
•	the quantity of mucous exudate,<br>
•	degree of hyperemia and thickening of stomach wall,<br>
•	hemorrhagic spots (focal or diffuse), nature of hemorrhages (petechial or<br>

•	perforations<br>
The observations on gastric mucosal irritation of animals of various groups were summarized below<br><br>
Table 13: Test Item: Group: Dose mg/kg (as acetylsalicylic acid): Observation<br>

In conclusion it was observed that none of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid induced any evidence of irritation of gastric mucosa at the two doses tested viz., 100 and 200mg/kg body weight In contrast, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has caused irritation of the gastric mucosal in all the fasted male albino rats at the dose level of 200mg/kg. However at the dose level of l00mg/kg aspirin failed to cause any evidence of gastric mucosal irritation in the male rats.<br>
Further none of the animals of different test groups showed any clinical symptoms of toxicity through out the observation period of three hours.<br>

CONCLUSION<br>
The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of new formulations of aspirin using blood clotting time as an index in albino rats. Aspirin served as positive control. The study was conducted at three dose levels with the new formulations and positive control along with a vehicle control group.<br>
Doses<br>
The doses for the main study were selected based on the dose range finding experiments with acetylsalicylic acid. All the doses were expressed as aspirin molar equivalents. The doses used for the main experiment for different formulations and positive control were same and presented below.<br><br>

L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid are as significant as acetylsalicylic acid with respect to clotting time observed after one hour but are far superior in terms of the absence of gastric irritation at all levels compared to acetylsalicylic acid.<br>
Efficacy of L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid compared to acetylsalicylic acid on Clotting Time in rats estimated two hours after dosing<br>
The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid compared to acetylsalicylic acid using blood clotting time, estimated 2 hours (±10 minutes) after dosing, as an index in albino rats. Aspirin served as positive control. Male albino rats were exposed to aspirin and to 3 new formulations of aspirin at one dose level of 20mg/kg body weight. No vehicle control group was used. The doses were expressed as aspirin molar equivalents. The doses used for the main experiment for different formulations and positive control was presented below.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid were found to be effective on clotting time.<br>
In conclusion, it was observed that based on the time required for the blood to clot (clotting time), when estimated 2 hours after dosing, the amino acid prodrugs were efficacous. However, the L-threonine ester of acetylsalicyclic acid was found to have relatively better efficacy than the other two formulations.<br>
As shown by FIG. 7 the statistical analysis showed that L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid are as effective as acetylsalicylic acid there is no significant difference at 5% significance level for L-Hydroxyproline ester of acetylsalicylic acid and L-threonine ester of acetylsalicylic with respect to positive control for the mean blood clotting time observed after two hours. However, combined with the gastric irritation potential, the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-Hydroxyproline esters of acetylsalicylic acid are far superior.<br><br>
There are a number of screening tests to determine the utility of the prodrugs created according to the disclosed methods. These include both in vitro and in vivo screening methods.<br>
The in vitro methods include acid/base hydrolysis of the prodrugs, hydrolysis in pig pancreas hydrolysis in rat intestinal fluid, hydrolysis in human gastric fluid, hydrolysis in human intestinal fluid, and hydrolysis in human blood plasma. These assays are described in Simmons, DM, Chandran, VR and Portmann, GA, Danazol Amino Acid Prodrugs: In Vitro and In Situ Biopharmaceutical Evaluation, Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, Vol 21, Issue 6, Page 687, 1995, the contents of all of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are effective in treating diseases or conditions in which NSAIDs normally are used. The prodrugs disclosed herein are transformed within the body to release the active compound and enhances the therapeutic benefits of the NSAIDs by reducing or eliminating biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers associated with each of them. However it should be noted that these prodrugs themselves will have sufficient activity without releasing any active drug in the mammals. Since the prodrugs is more soluble in water then Ibuprofen or other NSAIDs, it does not need to be associated with a carrier vehicle, such as alcohol or castor oil which may be toxic or produce unwanted side reactions. Moreover, oral formulations containing the NSAID prodrugs are absorbed into the blood and are quite effective.<br>
Thus, the prodrug of the present invention enhances the therapeutic benefits by removing biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers of existing drugs.<br>
Furthermore, the prodrugs are easily synthesized in high yields using reagents which are readily and commercially available.<br><br>
IV. Proline Derivative of Acetaminophen Overview:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the L-proline ester of acetaminophen is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section. The synthesis is exemplary. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. Acetaminophen (10 g) was coupled with Boc-L-proline with EDC in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMAP. Once the reaction was complete (3 hours at room temperature), the solution was washed with water. After drying over sodium sulfate, filtration, and concentration the crude protected amino acid ester of acetaminophen was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel. The procedure generated the protected L-proline ester of acetaminophen in 72%. The protecting group was removed by dissolving the ester in dichloromethane and passing hydrogen chloride through the solution at room temperature. After filtration, the final salt was stirred in tetrahydrofuran until pure. The yield for the deprotection step was 91.4% after filtration and drying under high vacuum at 90 °C for 4 hours.<br>

A mixture of Boc-L-proline (14.39 g, 68.80 mmole), acetaminophen (10.02 g, 66.28 mmole), EDC (12.9 g, 67.29 mmole) and DMAP (1.10 g, 9.0 mmole) in anhydrous dichloromethane (100 mL) was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature under an argon<br><br>
atmosphere. After 3 hours, water (120 mL) was added. After mixing for 5 minutes, the layers were separated and the dichloromethane fraction was washed with water (120 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (5 g). After filtration, concentration under reduced pressure, and drying under high vacuum, the remaining oil (24.10 g) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (100 g, 0.035-0.070 mm, 6 run pore diameter), eluting with hexanes/ethyl acetate (1:2). After concentration of the product containing fractions under reduced pressure and drying at high vacuum until the weight was constant, the experiment produced the protected acetaminophen-L-proline ester SPI001401 (16.71 g, 72.3% yield) as a white solid (foam).<br><br>

V. Amino Acid Derivative of Cyclosporine A<br>
The macrocyclic immunosuppresants comprise a class of structurally distinctive, cyclic, poly, N-methylated undecaptides, and similar semi-synthetic macrolide structures commonly possessing pharmacological, in particular immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and/or anti-parasitic activity. The first of the cyclosporine to be isolated was the naturally occurring fungal metabolite Ciclosporin or Cyclosporine also known as cyclosporine A, which has the formula:<br><br>
	MeBmt-V Abu-Sar-MeLeu-Val-MeLeu-Ala-(D)Ala-MeLeu-MeLeu-MeVal	<br>
|	123456789	10         11        |<br>
wherein MeBmt represents N-methyl-(4R)-4-but-2E-en-l-yl-4-methyl-(L) threonyl residue of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which -x-y- is CH=CH -(trans). Other similar products include, sirolimus (b), tacrolimus (c), and pimecrolimus (d), having the following structures:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The class comprised by the cyclosporines is thus now very large indeed and includes, for example, [Thr]2-, [Val]2-, [Nva]2- and [Nva]2-[Nva]5-Ciclosporin (also known as cyclosporines C, D, G and M respectively), [Dihydrop-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-ciclosporin (also known as dihydro-cyclosporine D), [(D)Ser]8-Ciclosporin, [Melle]u-Ciclosporin,<br>
Til<br>
[(D)MeVal]  -Ciclosporin (also known as cyclosporine H), [MeAla] -Ciclosporin, [(D)Pro]3-Ciclosporin and so on.<br>
In accordance with conventional nomenclature for cyclosporines, these are defined throughout the present specification and claims by reference to the structure of cyclosporine (i.e., Cyclosporine A). This is done by first indicating the amino acid residues present which differ from those present ion Ciclosporin (e.g., "[(D)Pro]3" to indicate that the cyclosporine in question has a -(D)Pro- rather than -Sar- residue at the 3-position) and then applying the term Cyclosporine to characterize remaining residues which are identical to those present in Cyclosporine A.<br>
As used herein, the term "cyclosporines" refers to the various types of cyclosporines, in which x-y in the MeBmt residue has a cis or trans CH=CH or in which x-y therein is also included in those derivatives in which one or more of those amino acids in positions 2-11 of Cyclosporine A is replaced by a different amino acid. It is preferred; however, that not more than two of the amino acids are replaced in the formula of cyclosporine A and more preferentially not more than one of the amino acids is replaced by an amino acid.<br>
In addition, amino acid residues referred to by abbreviation, e.g., -Ala-, -MeVal- and -VAbu-, are, in accordance with conventional practice, to be understood as having the (L)-configuration unless otherwise indicated, e.g. as in the case of "-(D)Ala-". Residue abbreviations preceded by "Me" as in the case of "-MeLeu-", represent V-N-methylated residues. Individual residues of the cyclosporine molecule are numbered, as in the art, clockwise and starting with the residue -MeBmt-, dihydro-MeBmt- etc.. .in position 1. The same numerical sequence is employed throughout the present specification and claims.<br>
Because of their unique pharmaceutical potential, the macrocyclic immunosuppressants have attracted considerable attention in the press. The term "macrocyclic immunosuppressants" includes various natural and semi-synthetic derivatives of cyclosporine, and other macrolides such as sirolimus, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. The primary area of clinical investigation for above drugs has been as immunosuppressive agents, in particular in relation to its application to recipients of organ transplants, e.g., heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney, pancreatic, bone-marrow, skin and corneal transplants, and in particular allogenic organ transplants. These drugs are also used in the treatment of psoriasis, atompic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and nephritic syndrome.<br>
Macrocyclic immunosuppressants are also useful for treating various autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions and especially inflammatory conditions with an<br><br>
aetiology, including an autoimmune component, such as arthritis (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis chronica progredient and arthritis deformons) and rheumatic diseases. Specific autoimmune diseases for which cyclosporine therapy has been proposed or applied include, autoimmune hematological disorder (including, e.g., hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pure red cell anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopaenia), systemic lupus erythematosus, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, including, e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), endocrine opthalmopathy Graves disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, primary billiary cirrhosis, juvenile diabetes (diabetes mellitus type I), uvetis (anterior and posterior), keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, interstial lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and glomerulonephritis (with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g., including idiopathic nephritic syndrome or minimal change nephropathy).<br>
Furthermore, macrocyclic immunosuppressants also have applicability as an anti-parasitic, in particular anti-protozoal agent, and are suggested to be useful for treating malaria, coccidiomycosis and schistomsomiasis. More recently, they have been taught to be useful as an agent for reversing or abrogating anti-neoplastic agent resistance conrumors, and the like.<br>
Despite the very major contribution which macrocyclic immunosuppressants have made, difficulties have been encountered in providing more effective and convenient means of administration (e.g., galenic formulations, for example, oral dosage form, which are both convenient and for the patient as well as providing appropriate bioavailability and allowing dosaging at an appropriate and controlled dosage rate) as well as the reported occurrence of undesirable side reactions; in particular nephrotoxic reactions have been obvious serious impediments to its wider use or application.<br><br>
Moreover, the above mentioned macrocyelic immunosuppressants are characteristically highly hydrophobic and readily precipitate in the presence of even very minor amounts of water, e.g., on contact with the body (e.g., stomach fluids). It is accordingly extremely difficult to provide e.g., oral formulations which are acceptable to the patient in terms of form and taste, which are stable on storage and which can be administered on a regular basis to provide suitable and controlling patient dosaging.<br>
Proposed liquid formulations, e.g., for oral administration of macrocyelic immunosuppressants, have heretofore been based primarily on the use of ethanol and oils or similar excipients as carrier media. Thus, the commercially available macrocyelic immunosupressant drink-solution employs ethanol and olive oil or corn-oil as carrier medium in conjunction with solvent systems comprising e.g., ethanol and LABRIFIL and equivalent excipients as carrier media. Thus, the commercially available macrocyelic immunosupressant drink solution employs ethanol and olive oil or corn-oil as carrier medium in conjunctions with a Labrifil as a surfactant. See e.g., U.S. Patent NO. 4,388,307. Use of the drink solution and similar composition as proposed in the art is however accompanied by a variety of difficulties.<br>
Further, the palatability of the known oil based system has proved problematic. The taste of the known drink-solution is, in particular, unpleasant. Admixture with an appropriate flavored drink, for example, chocolate drink preparation, at high dilution immediately prior to ingestion has generally been practiced in order to make regular therapy at all acceptable. Adoption of oil based systems has also required the use of high ethanol concentrations to itself inherently undesirable, in particular where administration to children is forseen. In addition, evaporation of the ethanol, e.g., from capsules (adopted in large part, to meet problems of palatability, as discussed or other forms (e.g., when opened) results in the development of a macrocyelic immunosupressant precipitate. When such compositions are presented in, for example, soft gelatin encapsulated form an additional problem arises. This particular difficulty necessitates packaging of the encapsulated product in an air-tight component, for<br><br>
example, an air-tight blister or aluminum-foil blister package. This in turn renders the product both bulky and more expensive to produce. The storage characteristics of the aforesaid formulations are, in addition, far from ideal.<br>
Bioavailability levels achieved using existing oral macrocyclic immunosupressant dosage system are also low and exhibit wide variation between individuals, individual patient types and even for single individuals at different times during the course of therapy. Reports in the literature indicates that currently available therapy employing the commercially available macrocyclic immunosupressant drink solution provides an average absolute bioavailability of approximately 30% only, with the marked variation between individual groups, e.g., between liver (relatively low bioavailability) and bone-marrow (relatively high bioavailability) transplant recipients. Reported variation in bioavailability between subjects has varied from one or a few percent for some patients, to as much as 90% or more for others. And as already noted, marked change in bioavailability for individuals with time is frequently observed. Thus, there is a need for a more uniform and high bioavailability of macrocyclic immunosupressant in patients.<br>
Use of such dosage forms is also characterized by extreme variation in required patient dosaging. To achieve effective immunosuppressive therapy, blood or blood serum levels compounds of the cyclosporin have to be maintained within a specified range. This required range can in turn, vary, depending on the particular condition being treated, e.g., whether therapy is to prevent transplant rejection or for the control of an autoimmune disease, or condition and on whether or not alternative immunosuppressive therapy is employed concomitantly with any of the immunosuppressants of the formula a-d therapy. Because of the wide variations in bioavailability levels achieved with conventional dosage forms, daily dosages needed to achieve required blood serum levels will also vary considerably from individual to individual and even for a single individual. For this reason it is necessary to monitor blood/blood-serum levels of patients receiving macrocyclic immunosuppressant therapy at regular and frequent intervals. Monitoring of blood/blood-serum levels, which is generally performed by<br><br>
RIA or equivalent immunoassay technique, e.g. employing monoclonal antibody based technology, has to be carried out on a regular basis. This is inevitably time consuming and inconvenient and adds substantially to the overall cost of therapy.<br>
It is also the case that blood/blood serum macrocyclic immunosuppressant levels achieved using available dosage systems exhibit extreme variation between peak and trough levels. That is for each patient, effective macrocyclic immunosuppressant levels in the blood vary widely between administrations of individual dosages.<br>
There is also a need for providing macrocyclic immunosuppressant in a water soluble form for injection. It is well known that Cremephore L used in a current formulations of macrocyclic immunosuppressants is a polyoxyethylated derivative of castor oil and is a toxic vehicle. There have been a number of incidences of anaphylaxis due to the castor oil component. At present there is no formulation that would allow the macrocyclic immunosuppressants to be in aqueous solution at the concentrations needed due to poor water solubility of the drug.<br>
Beyond all these very evident practical difficulties lies the occurrence of undesirable side reactions already alluded to, observed employing available oral dosage forms.<br>
Several proposals to meet these various problems have been suggested in the art, including both solid and liquid oral dosage forms. An overriding difficulty which has however remained is the inherent insolubility of the macrocyclic immunosuppressants in aqueous media, hence preventing the use of a dosage form which can contain macrocyclic immunosuppressants in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability, e.g. enabling effective resorption from the stomach or gut lumen and achievement of consistent and appropriately high blood/blood-serum levels.<br><br>
The particular difficulties encountered in relation to oral dosaging with macrocyclic immunosuppressants have inevitably led to restrictions in the use of macrocyclic immunosuppressant therapy for the treatment of relatively less severe or endangering disease conditions. A particular area of difficulty in this respect has been the adoption of macrocyclic immunosuppressant therapy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and other conditions affecting the skin, for example for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and, as also widely proposed in the art, for hair growth stimulation, e.g. in the treatment of alopecia due to ageing or disease.<br>
Thus while oral macrocyclic immunosuppressant therapy has shown that the drug is of considerable potential benefit to patients suffering e.g. from psoriasis, the risk of side-reaction following oral therapy has prevented common use. Various proposals have been made in the art for application of macrocyclic immunosuppressants, e.g. cyclosporine, in topical form and a number of topical delivery systems have been described. Attempts at topical application have however failed to provide any demonstrably effective therapy.<br>
However, the present invention overcomes the problems described hereinabove. More specifically, an embodiment of the present invention is a prodrug of macrocyclic immunosuppressant which significantly enhances its solubility in aqueous solutions, thereby avoiding the need to utilize a carrier, such as ethanol or castor oil when administered as a solution. Moreover, the prodrugs of macrocyclic immunosuppressant, in accordance with the present invention, do not exhibit the side effects of the prior art formulations. Further, the inventor has found that the macrocyclic immunosuppressant prodrugs of the present invention enhance its absorption when administered in the prodrug form to a patient, thereby enhancing significantly its bioavailability and its efficacy.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a prodrug of macrocyclic immunosuppressants. The prodrug consists of an amino acid esterified to the free<br><br>
hydroxy group present on the side chain of cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus and either one of the hydroxyl groups of the pimecrolimus molecule.<br>
For example, an aspect of the present invention is directed to, the compounds of the formulas<br>

In the latter case, GLY is glycine and AA is any V-amino acid. In the dipeptide structure, an AA is attached to the drug via OH group using glycine as the spacer. Glycine is esterified to cyclosporine and then glycine is bonded to any AA via amide linkage using amino group of glycine and carboxylic acid group of AA.<br>

Overview:<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the N-(L-proline)-glycine and N-(L-lysine)-glycine esters of Cyclosporine A is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section. These examples are exemplary of the synthetic scheme using amino acids. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. Cyclosporine A (15 g) was coupled with chloroacetic anhydride (4 equivalent) in anhydrous pyridine. The experiment produced the chloroacetate ester of Cyclosporine A (SPI001201, 14 g, 88%<br><br>
yield) in good yield. The chloroacetate ester (10.1 g) was then treated with sodium azide in DMF to generate the azidoacetate ester of Cyclosporine A (SPI001202, 9.9 g, 97% yield). The azidoacetate (9.8 g) was then reduced with tin chloride (9 g) to prepare the glycine ester of Cyclosporine A (8.54 g, 89% yield). The glycine ester of Cyclosporine A (SPI001203) was then coupled with a two-fold excess of either boc-L-proline or Boc-L-lysine using EDC as the coupling agent. After purification by column chromatography, the hoc protecting groups were removed from the dipeptide esters of Cyclosporine A at low temperature (5 °C) by treatment with 2M hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether. The L-lysine-glycine ester salt of Cyclosporine A did not require additional purification and was dried. The L-proline-glycine ester salt of Cyclosporine A required purification. The salt was converted to the free-base with sodium bicarbonate and purified by filtration through silica gel (eluting with acetone). The salt was then formed at low temperature with dilute anhydrous hydrochloric acid and dried.<br>

Cyclosporine A (15.01 g, 0.0124 moles) was dissolved in anhydrous pyridine (35 mL) at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere. The solution was cooled to 5 °C in an ice/water batch and chloroacetic anhydride (9.10 g, 0.053 moles) was added. After stirring for 10 minutes, the ice bath was removed and the solution was allowed to stir under an argon atmosphere at room temperature for 17 hours. After 17 hours, diethyl ether (200 mL) was added. The ether was washed with water (2x100 mL) and dried for 1 hour over sodium sulfate (10 g). After filtration and concentration under reduced pressure, the remaining yellow foam was dried under high vacuum (1 hour at room temperature) and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (200 g), eluting with heptane/acetone (2:1). After combining and concentrating the product containing fractions, the remaining light yellow foam (14.8 g) was purified a final time by crystallization from hot diethyl ether (140 mL). After cooling (-10 °C, 2 hours), filtration, and drying under high vacuum, the procedure generated the chloroacetate ester of Cyclosporine A SPI001201 as a white solid (14.0 g, 88.3% yield).<br>

The ethyl acetate fractions were combined, dried over sodium sulfate (20 g), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining clear foam was purified by filtration through silica gel (150 g), eluting with dichloromethane/methanol (20:1). The procedure generated the glycine ester of Cyclosporine A as a clear, solid foam (8.54g, 89% yield).<br>

The glycine ester of Cyclosporine A (SPI001203, 2.0 g, 1.59 mmole) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (25 mL) with boc-L-lysine (1.31 g, 3.78 mmole) and EDC (0.75 g, 3.9 mmole), under an argon atmosphere at room temperature. The boc-L-lysine was prepared from the dicyclohexylamine salt (2.0 g in 50 mL ether) by extraction with cold potassium hydrogen sulfate solution (1 g in 50 mL water) followed by cold water (2x50 mL). The ether containing the boc-L-lysine was dried over sodium sulfate (5 g), filtered, concentrated and dried under high vacuum for one hour at room temperature. A few crystals of DMAP were added to the mixture of EDC, boc-L-lysine, and the glycine ester of Cyclosporine A and the solution was allowed to stir for 4 hours at room temperature. The dichloromethane solution was extracted with DIUF water (50 mL), 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL), and with DIUF water (50 mL). After drying over sodium sulfate (10 g), the dichloromethane solution was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining white foam (3.01 g) was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (50 g), eluting with heptane/acetone (2:1). The product containing fractions were combined, concentrated under reduced pressure, and dried under high vacuum. The purified protected intermediate (2.34 g white solid, 92.8% yield) was placed in a flask under an argon atmosphere, which was cooled in an ice-water bath. Cold anhydrous 2 M hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether (20 mL) was added and the solution stirred for 8 hours (at 5 °C). The mixture was slowly allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. After stirring for a total of 20 hours, the flask was cooled again in an ice-water bath for 30 minutes. The product was filtered and dried under high vacuum for 1 hour at room temperature and then at 50 °C for 4 hours. The<br>

These prodrugs of cyclosporin of the present invention are effective in treating diseases or conditions in which macrocyclic immunosuppressants normally are used. These prodrugs are transformed within the body to release the active compound and enhances the therapeutic benefits of the macrocyclic immunosuppressants by reducing or eliminating biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers associated with each of them. However it should be noted that these prodrugs themselves will have sufficient activity without releasing any active drug in the mammals. Since the prodrugs are more soluble in water then cyclosporine or other macrocyclic immunosuppressants, it does not need to be associated with a carrier vehicle, such as alcohol or castor oil which may be toxic or produce unwanted side reactions. Moreover, oral formulations containing the prodrugs of the prodrugs are absorbed into the blood and are quite effective.<br>
Thus, the prodrug of cyclosporin of the present invention enhances the therapeutic benefits by removing biopharmaceutical and pharmacokenetic barriers of existing drugs.<br>
Furthermore, the prodrugs are easily synthesized in high yields using reagents which are readily and commercially available.<br>
VI. Valproic Acid Esters<br>
Valproic acid (2-Propylpentanoic acid) is low molecular weight carboxylic acid derivative which is widely used as an anti-convulsive agent, useful in the treatment of epilepsy and also possess vasodilatation activity in the brain to relieve migraine<br>
headaches. It is administered orally to control epileptic episodes in humans and also alleviate severe pain associated with migraine headaches.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
VALPROIC ACID<br>
Valproic acid has been shown to have a large number of therapeutic applications, which are quite varying and somewhat surprising. For example, in addition to its efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy and migraine headaches, it has been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain psychiatric illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, mood stabilization, control of aggression, impulsivity in personality disorder, agitation in dementia, and has also been of use as adjunct therapy in the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<br>
Mechanism of Action:<br>
In spite of being used in the treatment of epilepsy for a number of years, the exact mechanism of action of Valproic acid is still unknown. It has been postulated that it exerts its action by increasing concentration of gamma-ammo butyric acid (GABA) in the brain. Gamma-amino butyric acid is a neurotransmitter, a chemical that nerves use to communicate with one another.<br>
Valproate is the drug of choice in myoclonic epilepsy, with or without generalized tonic-clonic seizures, including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy of Janz that begins in adolescence or early adulthood. Photosensitive myoclonus is usually easily controlled. Valproate also is effective in the treatment of benign myoclonic epilepsy, postanoxic myoclonus, and, with clonazepam, in severe progressive myoclonic epilepsy that is characterized by tonic-clonic seizures as well. It also may be preferred in certain stimulus-sensitive (reflex, startle) epilepsies.<br><br>
Although Valproate may be effective for infantile spasms; it is relatively contraindicated in children whose spasms are due to hyperglycinemia or other underlying metabolic (mitochondrial) abnormalities. In general, atonic and akinetic seizures in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are difficult to control, but Valproate is the drug of choice for treatment of mixed seizure types. Since this drug has been useful in some patients who are refractory to all other antiepileptic drugs, it may warrant a trial in nearly all nonresponsive patients regardless of seizure type.<br>
In spite of it usefulness, hepatotoxicity may be fatal, but is idiosyncratic and not preventable by routinely monitoring liver enzymes. Hepatotoxicity occurs in very young children, most often those on multiple anticonvulsants. Valproate-induced cytopenias may be dose-related and warrant monitoring of complete blood counts during therapy. Encephalopathy with hyperammonemia without liver function test abnormalities may occur. Pregnant women in first month are at risk for neural tube defects.<br>
Valproic acid is a low molecular weight liquid with characteristic odor. Taken orally it has unpleasant taste and can severely irritate mouth and throat. In order to convert Valproic acid into a solid dosage form convenient for oral administration, a number of derivatives with covalent and ionic bond with the carboxylic acid have been made. A simple sodium salt of Valproic acid, resulting in Valproate sodium is available as a solid. However a stable coordination complex, know as Divalproex sodium was formed by partial neutralization of two molecules of Valproic acid with one atom of sodium. This product is the most widely available Valproic acid hemi salt marketed by Abbott Laboratories in the USA under the brand name Depakote®. Depakote® is also available in extended release formulation for oral administration.<br>
A significant disadvantage of Valproic acid is that it in liquid form it is difficult to administer. Furthermore, administration of Valproic acid in different forms does not uniformly produce desired bioavailability. For example, the overall bioavailability of Valproate from Valproic acid, its sodium salt, Divalproex®, and their extended release<br><br>
formulations are not quite interchangeable. Since continuous monitoring of plasma profile of Valproic acid is essential, any change in plasma concentration due to changes in the formulation adversely affect overall therapeutic outcome.<br>
In order to improve the therapeutic effectiveness, uniform blood profile, develop pharmaceutically elegant formulation and reduce first pass metabolism, present invention discusses prodrugs of Valproic acid which overcome some of the difficulties stated above.<br>
Until now there has been no pharmaceutical preparation has been available in the market that can deliver Valproic acid with out harmful side effects. The present invention however, has produced a number of water soluble, non-toxic derivatives of Valproic acid which are suitable for delivering Valproic acid consistently in the body without any harmful side effects and without the needs for expensive additives, and exepients.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a class of prodrugs of Valproic acid. The prodrug consists of the hydroxyl group of an amino acid esterified to the free carboxyl group present on the Valproic acid molecules. In another embodiment, the amine group of the amino acid is reacted with COOH group to form an amide linkage.<br>
More specifically, an embodiment of the present invention is directed to, the compounds of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; wherein R is either NH-AA or O-AA and AA is an amino acid, in which either an amine group or the hydroxyl group is reacted with the carboxylic acid group of Valproic Acid.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the various Valproic acid prodrugs above and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a patient in need of Valproic acid therapy, which method comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of the Valproic acid.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of converting liquid Valproic acid into a solid powder by reacting the carboxyl functionality of the Valproic acid with either amine or hydroxyl functionality of an amino acid and isolating the products thereof.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of substantially and in a therapeutically efficacious manner, reducing or eliminating the potential first pass metabolism thereby improving the consistent therapeutic effect by administering to a patient a prodrug which comprises reacting the COOH functionality of the Valproic acid molecule with either NH2 or OH functionality of selected amino acids to form an ester or amide covalent bond respectively and isolating the product thereof and administering said product to the patient.<br>
It has been found that when unsubstituted naturally occurring amino acids are esterified to Valproic acid, the resulting prodrugs are pharmaceutically elegant free flowing powders, and are rapidly absorbed into the body and release non-toxic amino acids upon cleavage in the body and require none of the emulsifiers, additives and other exepients.<br><br>
Furthermore, it has been shown that the current invention also produced drugs, while they are prodrugs of Valproic acid; they were highly effective anti-epileptics and were exhibiting such effect intact. Thus the current amino acid prodrugs are effective anti-epileptics and useful in the treatment of a number of psychiatric illnesses and exhibit such potential with or without releasing the active parent drug.<br>
The Valproic acid prodrug bulk density is much higher than the corresponding sodium salts, and they are suitable for compacting large weight tablets and capsules. Furthermore, their do not exhibit bitter taste and unusual odor of the Valproic acid.<br>
While the prodrugs my invention are not supposed to possess any acidic activity due to blockage of the carboxylic acid group responsible for such, however it has been shown that the prodrugs are effective anti-epileptics with or without releasing Valproic acid. However, all of the Valproic acid prodrugs described are released in vivo the active drug with all its pharmacological and psychoactive properties.<br>
The prodrug of Valproic acid clearly provides a number of advantages over Valproic acid, for example, all of the side chains cleaved from these prodrugs are naturally occurring essential amino acids hence are non-toxic. This results in high therapeutic index. Secondly all the prodrugs are readily cleaved in the body to release Valproic acid. Furthermore, due their high water solubility, they can be easily administered by either forming an in-situ solution just before IV administration using lyophilized sterile powder or providing the drug in solution in prefilled syringe or bottles for infusion. The aminoacid esters are more stable than Valproic acid since COOH group in Valproic acid is blocked to reaction with bases. Thus the Valproic acid prodrugs invented here are more effective then Valproic acid itself without the toxicity and other pharmaceutical problems associated with current marketed formulations.<br>
The procedure for the synthesis of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid) is outlined in Synthetic Sequence<br><br>
section and is exemplary for the preparation of the various prodrugs of the present invention. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. In general, valproic acid (2-8 g, in batches) was coupled with the N-benzyloxy/benzyl ester protected ammo acids using EDC in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMAP. Once the reactions were complete (20 hours at room temperature), the mixture was extracted with DIUF water, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was either used directly for the deprotection step or purified by column chromatography. The procedure generated the protected amino acid esters of valproic acid in yields ranging from 72% to 92%. The protecting groups were removed by hydrogenation (30 psi Ha) in the presence of 10% palladium on carbon. The amino acid esters of valproic acid were extracted away from the palladium catalyst with ethanol, concentrated, and dried. The final salts were formed by acidification with hydrochloric acid. The crude salts (yields ranging from 57% to 92%) were then purified by the methods described in the Experimental Section.<br>

VII WATER SOLUBLE PRODRUGS OF FIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
Fibric acid derivatives are useful anti-hyperlipidemic drugs useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in mammals where the symptoms are elevated triglycerides, low HDL (High density lipoproteins or "good" cholesterol, and elevated cholesterol. Fibric Acid derivatives are also useful in reducing LDL (Low density lipoproteins, or "bad"<br><br>
cholesterol). The general structure of the fibric acid analogs is represented below, where X is various mixed aliphatic and aromatic functionalities. Specific derivatives included in this formula are clofibric acid, fenofibric acid, ciprfibrate and gemfibrozil and the like.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
FIBRIC ACID ANALOGS<br>
Typical examples of the chemical moiety X in the above structure are shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Fibric acid analogs shown in the structure above have been shown to have a large number of therapeutic applications, which are quite varying and somewhat surprising. Broadly, these derivatives are useful in the treatment dyslipidemia and dyslipoproteinemia. Dyslipidemia and dyslipoproteinemia are herein defined to include the group selected from hypercholesterolemia, abnormal and elevated levels of cholesterol, abnormal and elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, abnormal and elevated levels of total cholesterol, abnormal and elevated levels of plasma cholesterol, abnormal and elevated levels of triglycerides, hypertrigylceridaemia, abnormal levels of lipoproteins, abnormal and elevated levels of low density lipoproteins (LDLs), abnormal and elevated levels of very low density lipoproteins, abnormal and elevated levels of very low intermediate density lipoproteins, abnormal levels of high density lipoproteins, hyperlipidemia, hyperchylomicronemia, abnormal levels of chylomicrons, related disorders, and combinations thereof such as those described in The ILIB Lipid Handbook for Clinical Practice, Blood Lipids and Coronary Heart Disease, Second Edition, A. M. Gotto et al, International Lipid Information Bureau, New York, N.Y., 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Mechanism of Action:<br>
The mechanism of action of Fibric acid derivatives seen in clinical practice have been explained in-vivo in transgenic mice and in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). Through this mechanism, Fibric acid derivatives increase lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity).<br>
The resulting fall in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles. These larger particles have greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are catabolized rapidly. Activation of PPAR-alpha also induces an increase in the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II, and HDL cholesterol.<br>
Fibric Acid derivatives are also useful in the treatment of gout, as they reduce serum uric acid levels in hyperurecemic patients.<br>
Hyperlipidemia types include type I, typeIIa, type IIb, type III, type IV, and type V. These types can be characterized according to the levels relative to normal of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and lipoproteins described above. Different classifications are derived from Drug Facts and Comparisons, 52nd Edition (1998) page 1066 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Many of the fibric acid derivatives when administered orally do not have sufficient bioavilability and absorption are variable, erratic and depended upon food. In fact absolute bioavialbility of many of the fibric acid derivatives is not possible since the prodrugs of fibric acids currently marketed as insoluble in water, hence a parenteral formuation is difficult or not available. Furthermore, since these drugs usually administered as esters, they are in fact prodrugs. These prodrugs have to be metabolized in the body to release active drug, which are the fibric acids. However, due to the ester formation of these drugs, they are quite insoluble in water, hence are difficult to formulate, and are not easily broken down in the body to release active drugs.<br>
Many of the Fibric acid derivatives are low to medium molecular weight solids with characteristic odor. Taken orally it has unpleasant taste and can severely irritate mouth and throat. Taken with food provides more blood concentration compared to fasting. This fed/fast difference in bioavailability is more pronounced when Fibric acid derivatives are compared against their corresponding prodrug derivatives. Overall bioavailability has been reported anywhere between 40-60 and quite variable among patients.<br>
One of the significant problems associated with currently marketed fibric acid derivatives being that when these prodrugs are cleaved in the body, they release the prodrug moiety, which themselves are highly toxic. For example, in the case of<br>
fenofibrate and gemfibrozil isopropyl alcohol is released as the esterase enzyme cleave the pro-moiety from the fenofibric acid. It is well know isopropanol is highly toxic when released into any of the mammalian tissues.<br>
In order to improve the therapeutic effectiveness, uniform blood profile, develop pharmaceutically elegant formulation and improve the solubility of the drug in water, present invention discusses alternative prodrugs of Fibric acid derivatives which overcome many of the difficulties stated above.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to alternate class of prodrugs of Fibric acid derivatives. The prodrug consists of the hydroxyl group of an amino acid esterified to the free carboxyl group present on the Fibric acid derivatives molecules. In another embodiment, the amine group of the amino acid is reacted with COOH of the fibric acids to form an amide linkage.<br>
More specifically, in one aspect of the present invention is directed to, the compounds of the formulas<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
where x is as defined hereinabove<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; wherein R is either NH-AA or O-AA and AA is an amino acid, in which either an amine group or the hydroxyl group is reacted with the carboxylic acid group of Fibric acid derivatives.<br>
The present invention is also directed in an embodiment to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the various Fibric acid derivatives prodrugs above and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a patient in need of Fibric acid derivatives therapy, which method comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of the Fibric acid derivatives.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of converting liquid Fibric acid derivatives into a solid powder by reacting the carboxyl functionality of the Fibric acid derivatives with either amine or hydroxyl functionality of an amino acid and isolating the products thereof.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of substantially and in a therapeutically efficacious manner, make the derivatives absorbed easily upon oral administration thereby improving the consistent therapeutic effect by administering to a patient a prodrug which comprises reacting the COOH functionality of the Fibric acid derivatives molecule with either NH2 or OH functionality of selected amino acids to form an ester or amide covalent bond respectively and isolating the product thereof and administering said product to the patient.<br>
It was determined that when unsubstituted naturally occurring amino acids are esterified to Fibric acid derivatives, the resulting prodrugs are pharmaceutically elegant free flowing powders, and are rapidly absorbed into the body and release non-toxic amino acids upon cleavage in the body and require none of the emulsifiers, additives and other exepients.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the current invention also produced drugs, while they are prodrugs of Fibric acid derivatives; they were highly effective anti-hyperlipidemics and were exhibiting such effect intact. Thus the current amino acid prodrugs are<br><br>
effective anti-hyperlipidemics and useful in the treatment of a number of high cholesterol related illnesses and exhibit such potential with or without releasing the active parent drug.<br>
While the prodrugs of fibric acidn of the present invention are not expected to possess any acidic activity due to blockage of the carboxylic acid group responsible for such, however it has been shown that the prodrugs of fibric acid are effective anti-hyperlipidemics with or without releasing Fibric acid derivatives. However, all of the Fibric acid derivatives prodrugs described are released in vivo the active drug with all its pharmacological and cholesterol lowering properties.<br>
The present invention clearly provides a number of advantages over Fibric acid derivatives, for example, all of the side chains cleaved from these prodrugs are naturally occurring essential amino acids hence are non-toxic. This results in high therapeutic index. Secondly all the prodrugs are readily cleaved in the body to release Fibric acid derivatives. Furthermore, due their high water solubility, they can be easily administered by either forming an in-situ solution just before IV administration using lyophilized sterile powder or providing the drug in solution in prefilled syringe or bottles for infusion. The aminoacid esters are more stable than Fibric acid derivatives since COOH group in Fibric acid derivatives is blocked to reaction with bases. Thus the Fibric acid derivatives prodrugs described here are more effective then Fibric acid derivatives itself without the toxicity and other pharmaceutical problems associated with current marketed formulations.<br>
The prodrugs of this invention are anti-hyperlipidemic drugs useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in mammals where the symptoms are elevated triglycerides, low HDL (High density lipoproteins or "good" cholesterol, and elevated cholesterol. Fibric Acid derivatives are also useful in reducing LDL (Low density lipoproteins, or "bad" cholesterol).<br><br>
Typical examples of synthesis of L-threonine, L-hydroxyproline and L-serine esters of Fibric acid derivatives are shown in the synthetic processes outlined below. These procedures are applicable to all other compounds of the Fibric acid derivatives class as well.<br>

The procedure for the synthesis of the L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline esters of fenofibric acid is outlined in Synthetic Sequence section and is exemplary. The complete procedure and analytical data is given in the Experimental Section. In general, fenofibric acid (100 g batches) was prepared from 4-chloro-4'-hydroxybezophenone in accordane with the procedures in the literature. Fenofibric acid was coupled with the t-butyl esters of N-Boc protected amino acid (L-serine, L-threonine, and L-hydroxyproline) using EDC as the coupling agents and a catalytic amount of DMAP. The protecting groups were removed at low temperature (5 °C, 3-6 days) with a mixture of hydrochloric acid in acetic acid (1M) with dichloromethane. The amino acid ester salts of fenofibric acid were purified by crystallization from ethyl acetate, and dried under high vacuum.<br>
