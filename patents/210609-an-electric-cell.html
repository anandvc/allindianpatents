TRANSMISSION OF GSM CIRCUIT-SWITCHED DATA OVER<br>
A CDMA LINK<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless telecommunications, and specifically to advanced cellular networks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Global System for Mobile (GSM) telecommunications is used in cellular telephone networks in many countries around the world. GSM offers a useful range of network services and standards, including facilities for data, as well as voice, transmission. Existing GSM networks are based on time-division multiple access (TDMA) digital communications technology.<br>
Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is an improved digital communications technology, which affords more efficient use of radio bandwidth than TDMA, as well as a more reliable, fade-free link between cellular telephone subscribers and base stations. The leading CDMA standard is IS-95, promulgated by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA).<br>
PCT patent application PCT/US96/20764, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a wireless telecommunications system that uses a CDMA air interface (i.e., basic RF communications protocols) to implement GSM network services and protocols. Using this system, at least some of the TDMA base stations (BSSs) and subscriber units of an existing GSM network would be replaced or supplemented by corresponding CDMA equipment. CDMA BSSs in this system are adapted to communicate with GSM mobile switching centers (MSCs) via a standard GSM A-interface. The core of GSM network services is thus maintained, and the changeover from TDMA to CDMA is transparent to users.<br>
Hybrid cellular communications networks, incorporating both GSM - and CDMA elements, are also described in PCT patent publications WO 95/24771 and WO 96/21999, and in an article by Tscha, et al, entitled "A Subscriber Signaling Gateway between CDMA Mobile Station and GSM Mobile Switching Center/' in Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Universal Personal Communications, Ottawa (1993), pp. 181-185, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The above-mentioned publications do not relate specifically to issues of<br>
data communications through hybrid cellular networks. Such issues include<br>
i<br>
both the need for protocol compatibility and the different demands of voice and data communications.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a hybrid GSM/CDMA cellular communications system, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figs, 2A and 2B are schematic block diagrams, illustrating communications protocol stacks between elements of the system of Fig. 1, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a schematic block diagram of a hybrid GSM/CDMA cellular communications system 20, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. System 20 is built around a public land mobile network (PLMN) 22, which is based on the GSM communications standard, as is known in the art and described briefly hereinabove- Infrastructure for such networks already exists and is in wide use in many countries, and the present invention has the advantage of enabling gradual introduction of CDMA service is conjunction with such a network without requiring major changes to the existing switching infrastructure.<br>
PLMN 22 comprises at least one mobile-services switching center (MSC) 24, or possibly a number of such centers (although only one MSC is shown here for clarity of illustration), which controls network operations within a geographical area. Among other functions, MSC 24 is responsible for location registration of subscriber units and handover of subscriber units between base stations, as well as linking PLMN 22 to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) and/or packet data network (PDN) 48. The MSC also includes or is linked to an inter-working function (IWF), which supports data communications as described hereinbelow, in accordance with GSM standards. The PLMN also comprises a network management center (NMC) 26 and a cell broadcast center (CBC) 28. The functions of these elements, as well as other aspects of system 20 and details regarding a mobile station (MS) 40 in the system, are described further in the above-mentioned U.S. and PCT Patent Applications.<br>
System 20 includes a plurality of MSs 40, which communicate with PLMN 22 via a plurality of base station subsystems (BSS) 30 and 32 over a wireless RF link at one or more of the accepted cellular communications frequencies. MS 40, which is also known as a subscriber unit, is preferably capable of communicating with both GSM BSS 30, using a standard GSM TDMA radio communications protocol, arid CDMA BSS 32, using CDMA-based communication methods described hereinbelow. Although for the sake of clarity, only one each of MS 40, GSM BSS 30 and CDMA BSS 32 is shown in Fig. 1, it will be understood that in actuality, system 20 typically comprises a plurality of each of these system elements.<br><br>
Both GSM BSS 30 and CDMA BSS 32 communicate with and are controlled by MSC 24, substantially in accordance with GSM standards, i.e., via the GSM standard A-interface, as further described herein below with reference to Figs. 2A and 2B. BSS 32 also communicates with CBC 28, so as to receive messages to be broadcast over the air, and comprises a radio operation and maintenance center (OMC-R) 38, which communicates with NMC 26 over a GSM-standard Q3 interface. Optionally, BSS 32 may be linked to a general packet data service (GPRS), such as has been proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Communications between BSS 32 and the GPRS are further described in a U.S. patent application entitled 'CDMA Transmission of Packet-Switched Data/' filed on even date, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application andj incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Communications between CDMA BSS 32 and MS 40 are built on a<br>
i<br>
CDMA radio "air interface," which is preferably based on the IS-95 standard<br>
i<br>
for CDMA communications, and most preferably with the TIA/EIA-95-B version of the standard, with necessary modifications as described herein. BSS 32 is built around a base station controller (BSC) 34, which controls and communicates with a number of base station transceivers (BTS) 36. Each BTS transmits RE signals to and receives RF signals from MS 40 when the MS is within a geographical area, or cell, served by the particular BTS] On the other hand, when MS 40 is within a cell served by GSM BSSJ 30, the MS communicates with BSS 30 over a GSM/TDMA air interface.       j<br>
In order to sustain both of these interfaces, MS 40 comprises mobile equipment (ME) 42, which preferably includes either two radio transceivers, one configured for TDMA operation and one for CDMAJ or a single transceiver which can dynamically switch between TDMA and CDMA. The MS includes mobile termination (MT), which supports* terminal equipment (TE) 46 for data input and output. Preferably, TE 46 comprises a user terminal, such as a personal computer or fax machine, coupled!to input and output data via the MT. In addition, MS 40 comprises a subscriber identity module (SIM) 44, in accordance with GSM standards. *<br>
Fig, 2A is a block diagram that schematically illustrates protocol stacks used in signaling interfaces between MS 40, CDMA BSS 32 and GSM MSC 24, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. These interfaces enable MS 40 to communicate with GSM MSC 24 oven a CDMA air interface.   Operation of these interfaces, and particularly message flow<br><br>
through these interfaces, is described in greater detail in the above-mentioned PCT application PCT/US96/20764, as well as in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application entitled "Base Station Handover in a Hybrid GSM /CDMA Network/' When MS 40 is in communication with MSC 24 via GSM BSS 30, the protocol stacks are in accordance with GSM standards, substantially without modification.<br>
MS 40 communicates with CDMA BSS 32 over a CDMA Urn interface, based on a CDMA air interface which is modified for compatibility of signaling with the GSM standard. The CDMA air interface between MS 40 and CDMA BSS 32 comprises CDMA Layer 1, which preferably operates on a standard IS-95 protocol, and GSM-CDMA Layer 2, in which IS-95 operation is adapted to accommodate the needs of GSM Layer 3 protocols. Layer 2 supports transmission of frames between MS 40 and BSS 30 or 32. GSM-CDMA Layer 2 includes functionality, such as message ordering, priority and fragmentation, and suspension and resumption of communications, which is normally supported by the standard GSM Layer 2, but not by CDMA IS-95. GSM-CDMA Layer 2 also supports message sizes up to at least the maximum message size permitted by GSM Layer 2 (251 bytes), which is greater than the maximum IS-95 message size. Vis-a-vis GSM BSS 30, air interface Layers 1 and 2 are in accordance with GSM standards, substantially without modification.<br>
Standard GSM. protocols include three Radio Interface sub-layers (RIL3) above the physical and framing layers GSM Layer 1 and Layer 2; Radio Resource (RR) management, Mobile Management (MM) and Connection Management (CM) . The CM layer supports signaling for call processing, as well as GSM supplementary services and short message service (SMS). The MM layer supports signaling required for locating MS 40, authentication and encryption key management.<br>
In order to support the substantially unmodified GSM MM and CM layers, a GSM-CDMA RR layer is introduced in the MS 40 and BSS 32 protocol stacks. The GSM-CDMA RR layer, which manages radio resources and maintains radio -links between MS 40 and BSSs 30 and 32, is "aware" of the existence of the dual GSM and CDMA lower layers (Layers 1 and 2) in the MS 40 protocol stack. It invokes the appropriate lower layers in the MS stack to communicate with either the standard RIL3-RR layer over the GSM Um interface or the GSM-CDMA RR layer of BSS 32 over the CDMA Um interface, depending on instructions it receives from, the BSS with which it is in<br><br>
communication. The KK layer in the MS stack also controls! the handover between the corresponding air interfaces defined in Layers % and 2, under<br>
instructions from MSC 24, BSS 30 and BSS 32.<br>
Regardless of which of the air interfaces is In use, the GSM-CDMA RR<br>
layer supports the standard GSM RIL3-MM and CM layers above it. The MM and CM layers are not processed by BSS 32, but are rather relayed through between MS 40 and MSC 24 for processing in a manner! substantially transparent to the CDMA air interface layers below. Further ieatures of the RR layer are described in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application entitled "Base Station Handover in a Hybrid GSM/CDMA Network."    CDMA BSS 32 communicates with GSM MSC 24 over a standard,<br>
substantially unmodified GSM A-interface. This interface is i based on the<br>
GSM SS7 and BSS Application Part (BSSAP) protocols, as are kn6wn in the art,<br>
preferably in accordance with the GSM 08.06 and 08.08. standard. BSSAP<br>
supports procedures between MSC 24 and BSS 32 that require interpretation<br>
and processing of information related to single calls and resource<br>
management, as well as transfer of call control and mobility! management<br>
messages between MSC 24 and MS 40. BSS 32 translates CpMA Layer 1,<br>
GSM-CDMA Layer 2 and GSM-CDMA RR protocols exchangee! between the<br>
BSS and MS 40 into appropriate SS7 and BSSAP protocols for transmission to<br>
MSC 24, and vice versa.	i<br>
Because CDMA BSC 34 communicates with GSM MSC 24 using the standard A-interface, substantially no modifications are required in the core GSM MSC in order to enable the addition of CDMA BSS 32 to GSM system 20. Furthermore, MSC 24 need not be aware that there is any difference in identity between GSM/TDMA BSS 30 and CDMA BSS 32, since both communicate with the MSC in a substantially identical manneir over the A-<br>
interface.	!	.<br>
i<br>
Fig. 2B is a block diagram that schematically illustrates;transmission<br>
protocol stacks involved in providing circuit-switched data vfe MS 40 and<br>
i<br>
CDMA BSS 32 and MSC/IWF 24, in accordance with a preferred! embodiment of the present invention. ME/MT 42 exchanges user data with TE 46 via a connection at a reference point R, using a GSM-compatible terminal adaptation function (TAF) in the MS. The TAF is adapted to Whatever TE protocol is in use, such as an asynchronous protocol, as is knownj in the art, or alternatively a synchronous protocol. When the incoming data are asynchronous, MS 40 applies a rate adaptation (RAO) function, ijn accordance<br><br>
with GSM protocols, which pads the asynchronous data with additional stop elements so as to fit the nearest available GSM synchronous data channel These data channels have rates of 2n x 600 bit/sec (go that 75 bit/sec and 300 bit/sec signaling rates are adapted to a 'synchronous 600 bit/sec stream). MSC/IWF 24 includes a RAO function that is a "mirror image" of RAO in MS 40. MS 40 and MSC/IWF 24 also include a GSM fax adapter function, which provides a standard fax interface in the MS and compensates for differences in transmission delays encountered in cellular, as opposed to wired, communication networks.<br>
Known (non-transparent) user protocols are transported from MS 40 to MSC 24 through BSS 32 using a GSM Layer 2 relay (L2R) function, preferably in accordance with GSM standard 07.01, which is incorporated herein by reference. Whereas transparent protocols generally transmit an input bitstream without modification, non-transparent protocols modify the bitstream before transmission, typically in order to reduce the required transmission data rate. L2R uses the services provided by a GSM radio link protocol (RLP), preferably in accordance with GSM standard 04.22, which is incorporated herein by reference, to reliably transport the L2R protocol information over the air.<br>
Synchronous user data output by RAO and by the fax adapter and RLP functions of MS 40 are adapted for transport over the CDMA Um interface by a rate adapter V (RAl') function. RAl' adapts the data rates of RAO, the fax adapter and RLP to IS-95 radio interface data rates, which are generally different from the GSM data rates. Higher data rates, over 9,600 bps, can be accommodated by IS-95 medium data rate (MDR) transmission, as further described hereinbelow.<br>
Rate adaptation between BSS 32 and MSC /IWF 24 is performed by GSM rate adaptation 1 (RAl) and rate adaptation 2 (RA2) functions, so that the data are conveyed over the A-interface at a standard GSM circuit switched data rate, The RAl function adapts the synchronous data conveyed by RAl' to intermediate data rates of 8 or 16 kbit/sec. The RA2 function is specified by CCITT standard V.110 and is used to adapt RAl data'to a 64 kbit/sec rate, as required by CCITT El data transport protocols. These protocols are based on a 2 Mbit/sec data stream, with a frame structure of 32 x 64 kbit/sec. The MSC/IWF is shown schematically to include an LI layer, by means of which the user data from TE 46 are output to a compatible terminal or fax (not shown in the figures), generally after transport over PSTN/PDN 48.<br><br>
Although the communications protocol layers above are described generally with reference to functions required to adapt a data stream from TE 46 for transport to MSC/IWF 24, it will be understood that the jsame protocol layers are also used to adapt synchronous, high-speed data from MSC/IWF 24 for transport to and output by TE 46. MSC/IWF 24 thus (transmits and receives data to and from TE 46 via ME/MT 42 and BSS 32 substantially without regard to the fact that the data between the BSS and MS 40 are CDMA-encoded, as though MS 40 were operating in GSM/TDMA mode.<br>
As noted hereinabove, when the user data rate exceeds ordinary CDMA traffic channel rates, the IS-95 MDR feature for high-speed data services is preferably used to accommodate the excess data, In this case, MS 40 and BSS 32 open multiple traffic channels between them. ; Since there is frequently a greater volume of data being transported in one direction than in the other (most frequently in a forward direction, i.e., from BS^ 32 to MS 40) the number of channels opened in the two directions need not be equal For example, there may be four forward channels and only two reverse channels opened. In each direction, there is preferably one fundamental code traffic channel, which carries signaling (Fig. 2A) along with data, an$ up to seven supplemental code traffic channels for high-speed data. The fundamental channel is active substantially continuously, whereas the supplemental channels are activated as needed based on the total data rate at ajiy time.<br>
IS-95 MDR can be used to provide high-speed data service comparable to that defined in the GSM Phase 2+ standard for high-speed circuit-switched data (HSCSD). The IS-95 MDR CDMA transmission has tl^e advantage, however, of dynamic bandwidth allocation, as opposed to static allocation of TDMA time slots in HSCSD- This CDMA approach thus allows more efficient use of the available transmission spectrum, both at MDR and at normal data rates, than does the conventional GSM TDMA approach.<br>
Although preferred embodiments are described hereinabove with<br>
reference to a particular hybrid GSM/CDMA system, it will be appreciated<br>
that the principles of the present invention may similarly be applied to effect<br>
over-the-air data transfer in other hybrid communication systems, as well. The<br>
scope of the present invention encompasses not only the complete systems<br>
and communications processes described hereinabove, but also various<br>
innovative elements of these systems and processes, as well as combinations<br>
and sub-combinations thereof.	!<br><br>
It will thus be appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and the full scope of the invention is limited only by the claims.<br><br><br><br>
