				<td>FLUORESCENT pH DETECTOR SYSTEM AND RELATED METHODS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fluorescent pH detector and methods for measuring<br>
pH using the fluorescent pH detector.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Optical sensors (optrodes) for measuring pH are well known. Certain aromatic<br>
organic compounds (like phenolphthalein) change color with pH and can be immobilized<br>
on solid supports to form "pH paper." These visual indicators are easy to use, but do not<br>
provide a quantitative reading. The color changes can be difficult to distinguish<br>
accurately, and can be masked by colored analyte. Fluorescent indicators have also been<br>
used as optical sensors. pH Sensitive fluorescent dyes can be immobilized on solid<br>
supports and generally are more sensitive in comparison to the simple color changing<br>
(absorbance or reflectance based) indicators. The improved sensitivity of fluorescent<br>
indicators allows the solid support to be rniniaturized, and this has been used to advantage<br>
in development of fiber optic sensor devices for measuring pH, CO2, and O2 parameters<br>
in blood.<br>
A specific need in the medical industry exists for accurate pH measurement of<br>
blood. The pH of blood, or other bodily fluids (pleural effusions) can be associated with<br>
certain physiologic responses associated with pathology. Blood gas analyzers are<br>
common critical care instruments. Depending on storage conditions, the pH of separated<br>
blood components (plasma, platelets) can change rapidly due to off-gassing of dissolved<br>
CO2 from the enriched venous blood that is collected from a donor. Platelets in particular<br>
are metabolically active, and generate lactic acid during storage at 20-22°C. European<br>
quality guidelines for platelets prepared by the "buffycoat method" require pH of stored<br>
platelets to be pH 6.8-7.4 at 37°C (7.0-7.6 at 22°C).<br>
Serninaphthofluorescein (SNAFL) compounds and the related<br>
seminaphthorhodafluor (SNARF) compounds are commercially available ratiometric<br>
fluors (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR; see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,945,171)<br>
and their synthesis and spectral properties have been described. These compounds have<br>
advantages including long wavelength absorbance that can be efficiently excited with<br><br>
LED light sources. Relevant acid/base equilibria and associated spectral properties are<br>
shown below.<br><br>
Deprotonation of the naphthol structure of SNAFL dyes gives a naphtholate molecule<br>
with longer wavelength fluorescence emission. The pKa is the pH value where the two<br>
molecular species form in equal amounts. SNAFL compounds with reactive linker<br>
groups that allow their conjugation to other molecules of interest are also commercially<br>
available.<br>
Various methods have been used to immobilize "ratiometric" dyes to solid<br>
supports for use in fiber optic pH detectors. Carboxynaphmofluorescein (CNF) has been<br>
conjugated to arninoethyl-cellulose and this material was glued to polyester (Mylar) films<br>
to make sensing membranes for optrodes. The pKa of this material was 7.41, slightly<br>
lower than the free CNF (pKa 7.62). The use of tetraethoxysilane to trap CNF in a<br>
sol-gel glass that was formed on glass cover slips has also been reported. The pKa of<br>
this material was 7.46. A 9-chloro substituted SNAFL analog (SNAFL-2) has been<br>
reacted with polyvmylamine and the residual amino groups were crosslinked with a<br>
photocrosslinker to form a gel-like coating on acrylic fibers. The pKa of this fiber-optic<br>
sensor was 7.14, significantly lower than the published pKa of the free SNAFL<br>
compound (pKa ~7.7). This shows that molecular environment and linker structure<br>
surrounding the immobilized dye can alter the performance of a pH detector.<br>
Despite the advances made in the detection of pH noted above, there exists a need<br>
for improved methods and devices for measuring pH. The present invention seeks to<br>
fulfill this need and provides further related advantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for measuring pH and a system for<br>
measuring pH. The method and system are suited to measure the pH of a specimen<br>
contained in a sealed container.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a method for measuring pH is provided. In the<br>
method, pH is determined by comparing fluorescent emission intensities from a single<br>
fluorescent species having pH-dependent fluorescent emission. The fluorescent species<br>
having pH-dependent fluorescent emission has a first emission intensity at a first<br>
wavelength and a second emission intensity at a second wavelength, the first and second<br>
emission intensities being characteristic of pH in the environment of the fluorescent<br><br>
species. The ratio of the first and second emission intensities provides pH measurement.<br>
Calibration of the first and second emission intensities provides an intensity-based<br>
reference (ratio information) that is used to determine the pH of the environment of the<br>
fluorescent species.<br>
The method of the invention is a fluorescent wavelength-ratiometric method. As<br>
used herein, the term "fluorescent wavelength-ratiometric" refers to the method by which<br>
the first and second fluorescent emission intensities measured at first and second emission<br>
wavelengths, respectively, are ratioed to provide pH information.<br>
In the method, the fluorescent species having pH-dependent fluorescent emission<br>
is immobilized on a substrate in contact with the sample such that the fluorescent species<br>
is in contact with the sample. The immobilized fluorescent species in contact with the<br>
sample is located in the sample such that the fluorescent species can be interrogated. The<br>
fluorescence measurement is made by irradiating the fluorescent species at a wavelength<br>
sufficient to elicit fluorescent emission, which is then measured. Because of the<br>
pH-dependent nature of the fluorescent species' emission profile (i.e., first and second<br>
fluorescent emission intensities measured at first and second emission wavelengths,<br>
respectively) the measurement of the fluorescent emission profile yields the pH of the<br>
fluorescent species' environment (i.e.5 sample pH).<br>
In one embodiment of the method of the invention, the sample for which the pH is<br>
to be determined is contained in a sealed vessel. This method is suitable for measuring<br>
pH of blood and blood products sealed in a conventional blood storage vessel.<br>
In another embodiment, the sample for which the pH is to be determined is<br>
contained in an open vessel. As used herein, the term "open vessel" refers to a vessel that<br>
is not sealed. This method is suitable where contamination of the sample being measured<br>
is to be avoided. In this method, the probe is cleaned and/or sterilized and is used once<br>
and discarded. This method is suitable for measuring the pH of materials used in food,<br>
pharmaceutical, or biological research where the vessel containing the material is not<br>
sealed (i.e., open). Such a "lab-use" system includes a tip (see description below) placed<br>
onto the probe. The pH measurement is made by immersing the tip into the sample and<br>
measuring pH. The tip is removed from the sample, removed from the probe, and<br>
discarded.<br>
In the method for measuring the pH of a contained sample, the<br>
substrate-immobilized fluorescent species is introduced into the vessel either before or<br><br>
after the sample is placed in the vessel. As used herein, the term "sealed vessel" refers to<br>
a vessel that prevents its contents from exposure to the environment exterior to the vessel.<br>
The sealed vessel prevents the contents of the vessel from contact from, for example,<br>
liquids and gases outside of the vessel. The sealed vessel also prevents the contents of<br>
the vessel from escaping the vessel.<br>
The vessel can be manufactured to include the substrate-immobilized fluorescent<br>
species as a component of the vessel. In such an embodiment, the substrate-immobilized<br>
fluorescent species is incorporated into the vessel during manufacture to provide a vessel<br>
into which a sample can be later introduced and its pH measured. The manufacture of a<br>
vessel incorporating the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species is described in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Alternatively, the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species can be introduced<br>
into the vessel after the sample has been introduced into the vessel. In such an<br>
embodiment, the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species is introduced into the vessel<br>
by a process in which the vessel is first punctured (or spiked) to introduce the<br>
substrate-immobilized fluorescent species and then resealed to provide a sealed vessel<br>
including the sample now in contact with the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species.<br>
The process for introducing the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species into a sealed<br>
vessel is described in Example 2.<br>
As noted above, the vessel including the substrate-immobilized fluorescent<br>
species in contact with the sample is sealed before, during, and after interrogation.<br>
Interrogation of the fluorescent species requires excitation of the species at a wavelength<br>
sufficient to effect fluorescent emission from the species and measurement of that<br>
fluorescent emission. In the method of the invention, interrogation is accomplished<br>
through a window in the sealed vessel. The fluorescent species is excited by irradiation<br>
through the window, and emission from the fluorescent species is collected from the<br>
fluorescent species though the window. The window is a component of the sealed vessel<br>
and allows for interrogation of the fluorescent species in contact with the sample. The<br>
window is sufficiently transparent at the excitation and emission wavelengths to permit<br>
interrogation by the method. The substrate-immobilized fluorescent species is positioned<br>
in proximity to the window sufficient for interrogation: proximity sufficient to<br>
effectively excite the fluorescent species and to effectively collect emission from the<br>
fluorescent species. It will be appreciated that for epifluorescence applications, a single<br><br>
window is used. However, other methods and devices of the invention can include other<br>
optical paths, such as straight-through or right angle optical paths, where more than one<br>
window can be used.<br>
The method of the invention includes irradiating the substrate-immobilized<br>
fluorescent species, which in one embodiment is contained along with a sample in a<br>
sealed vessel, at a wavelength sufficient to effect emission from the fluorescent species<br>
and to measure that emission. Exciting light and fluorescent emission pass through the<br>
sealed vessel's window. In one embodiment, the sealed vessel further includes a port for<br>
receiving a housing that holds the excitation light guide and emission light guide. In one<br>
embodiment, the excitation light guide includes one or more optical fibers that transmit<br>
the excitation light from a light source to the fluorescent species. In one embodiment, the<br>
emission light guide includes one or more optical fibers that transmit the emission light<br>
from the fluorescent species to a light detector. The port receiving the housing is<br>
positioned in proximity to the window sufficient for interrogation: proximity sufficient to<br>
effectively excite the fluorescent species and to effectively collect emission from the<br>
fluorescent species.<br>
As with all optical fluorescent methods, the method of the invention includes a<br>
light source for exciting the fluorescent species and a detector for measuring the emission<br>
of the fluorescent species. Light sources, wavelength selection filters, and detectors are<br>
selected based on the absorbance and emission profiles of the fluorescent species used in<br>
the method.<br>
Suitable light sources provide excitation energy at a wavelength and intensity<br>
sufficient to effect fluorescent emission from the fluorescent species. The light source<br>
can provide relatively broad wavelength, band excitation (e.g., ultraviolet or white light<br>
sources) or relatively narrower wavelength band excitation (e.g., laser or light-emitting<br>
diode). To enhance excitation efficiency and emission measurement, relatively broad<br>
wavelength band exciting light from the source can be selected and narrowed through the<br>
use of diffraction gratings, monochromators, or filters to suit the fluorescent species.<br>
Suitable light sources include tungsten lamps, halogen lamps, xenon lamps, arc lamps,<br>
LEDs, hollow cathode lamps, and lasers.<br>
Suitable detectors detect the intensity of fluorescent emission over the emission<br>
wavelength band of the fluorescent species. To enhance emission measurement,<br>
fluorescent emission from the fluorescent species source can be selected and narrowed<br><br>
through the use of diffraction gratings, monochromators, or filters to suit the fluorescent<br>
species. Suitable detectors include photomultiplier tubes and solid state detectors, such as<br>
photodiodes, responsive to the wavelength emission band of the fluorescent species.<br>
Other suitable detectors are photovoltaic cells, PEN diodes, and avalanche photodiodes.<br>
Through the use of filters, all of the excitation light that reflects off the target is<br>
filtered out before reaching the detector. This can be achieved by using filters in both the<br>
excitation and emission optical paths. In certain instances, reflected excitation light<br>
(which is many orders of magnitude more intense than the emission light) that reaches the<br>
detector can swamp the specific signal. Generally, 10E5' (105) or greater out-of-band<br>
rejection is appropriate in each of the filter sets. Reduction of excitation light can also be<br>
achieved by using an angled window so that reflected light is directed away from the<br>
emission detector. However, such an optical path is not as effective as filter sets.<br>
Excitation light from the source can be directed to the fluorescent species through<br>
the use of a light guide, such as one or more optical fibers. Similarly, emission from the<br>
fluorescent species can be directed to the detector through the use of a light guide, such as<br>
one or more optical fibers.<br>

schematically in FIGURE 1A. Referring to FIGURE 1A, system 100 includes controller<br>

The excitation light waveguide transmits excitation light from the light source<br>
through the probe member to the fluorescent species. In one embodiment, the excitation<br>
light waveguide includes one or more optical fibers. In one embodiment, the excitation<br>
waveguide is a single optical fiber. A representative fiber optic useful in the system of<br>
invention is RO2-534 commercially available from Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ.<br>
The first and second emission light waveguides transmit fluorescent emission<br>
from the fluorescent species through the probe member to the first and second emission<br>
detectors, respectively.<br>
In one embodiment, the first emission light waveguide includes one or more<br>
optical fibers. In one embodiment, the first emission light waveguide includes a plurality<br>
of optical fibers. In one embodiment, the first emission light waveguide includes four<br>
optical fibers. A representative fiber optic useful in the system of invention is R02-533<br>
commercially available from Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ.<br>
In one embodiment, the second emission light waveguide includes one or more<br>

include photodiodes, PIN diodes, and photomultiplier tubes. In one embodiment, the first<br>
and second emission detectors are photodiodes responsive in the range from 400 to<br>

BPW34 commercially available from Vishay Intertechnology, Malvern, PA.<br>
A representative probe member housing excitation and emission light guides<br>
useful in the system of the invention is illustrated schematically in FIGURE 2. As shown<br>
in FIGURE 2, the light guides are optical fibers. Referring to FIGURE 2, probe member<br>
185 houses excitation light guide 290, a plurality of first emission light guides 390, and a<br>
plurality of second emission light guides 490. In the representative probe member shown<br>
in FIGURE 2, there are four first emission light guides 390, and four second emission<br>
light guides 490. The four first emission light guides can be considered to be a first<br>
channel (e.g., measuring the first fluorescent emission from the fluorescent species) and<br>
the four second emission light guides can be considered to be a second channel<br>
(e.g., measuring the second fluorescent emission from the fluorescent species). In the<br>
illustrated representative probe member, the fibers from each of the two sets of fibers<br>
alternate (i.e., alternating fibers 390 and 490) around the central fiber (290). This<br>
configuration provides for evening out of "hot spots" so that light collected by the first set<br>
is similar to the light collected by the second set.<br>
The relationship between the probe member housing the excitation/emission light<br>
guides and the sealed vessel port is illustrated schematically in FIGURE 3. Referring to<br>
FIGURE 3, probe member 185 is received by port 205. Port 205 includes window 210,<br>
which is transparent to excitation and emission wavelengths used in the fluorescent<br>
measurement. Excitation light emanating from light guide 290 passes through window<br>
210 and interrogates substrate 220 on which the fluorescent species is immobilized and<br>
which, in the operation of the method of the invention, is in contact with the sample<br>
contained in sealed vessel 200. Irradiation of substrate 220 results in excitation of the<br>
substrate-immobilized fluorescent species and fluorescent emission from the fluorescent<br>
species. Emission from the fluorescent species is received by and transmitted through<br>
light guides 390 and 490 to detectors 382 and 482, respectively (see FIGURE IB). As<br>
noted above, the fluorescent species' first emission intensity and the second emission<br>
intensity will depend on the pH of the sample.<br><br>
A representative port assembly for introducing the substrate-immobilized<br>
fluorescent species into a sealed vessel is illustrated in FIGURES 4A and 4B.<br>
FIGURE 4A illustrates the assembled port and FIGURE 4B is an exploded view of the<br>
port assembly.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 4A and 4B, port assembly 202 includes port 205 and tip<br>
215. Port 205 is a cylinder terminating with window 210 and having opening 212 for<br>
receiving probe member 185 (not shown). In one embodiment, port 205 tapers from<br>
opening 212 to window 210 such that the depth of insertion of probe member 185 into<br>
port 205 is predetermined by the probe's diameter. In one embodiment, the depth of<br>
travel of 185 in assembly 202 is limited by a ledge (not shown). In one embodiment, the<br>
optimal distance between probe and membrane was determined to be 2 mm or less.<br>
FIGURE 21 illustrates the fluorescence intensity measured as a function of distance<br>
between the probe and membrane. When inserted in the port, the face of probe member<br>
185 and window 210 are substantially parallel. Port 205 and tip 215 are adapted such that<br>
the port and tip are reversibly connectable. In one embodiment, port 205 includes annular<br>
inset 214 and tip 215 includes opening 216 defined by annular lip 218 for receiving inset<br>
214. In this embodiment, inset 214 has a diameter less than opening 216. It will be<br>
appreciated that the connecting relationship between the port and tip can be reversed<br>
(i.e., port having annular lip for receiving tip having inset). Lip 218 defines bed 222 for<br>
receiving substrate 220, which is secured in port assembly 202 when port 205 is<br>
connected to tip 215. Tip 215 includes aperture 224 in bed 222. Aperture 224 provides<br>
for contact of substrate 220 with a liquid sample contained in a sealed vessel into which<br>
port assembly is introduced. Tip 215 terminates with apex 226 that facilitates the<br>
introduction of port assembly 202 into a sealed vessel by puncture. FIGURE 4C is a plan<br>
view of tip 215 illustrating bed 222 and aperture 224. In one embodiment, the assembly<br>
is made from Lexan HPS1 1125 available from GE Polymerland, Pittsfield, MA;<br>
Representative sealed vessels incorporating the substrate-immobilized fluorescent<br>
species are illustrated in FIGURES 5A and 5B. FIGURE 5A illustrates a sealed vessel<br>
into which a port assembly has been inserted by puncture. FIGURE 5B illustrates a<br>
sealed vessel manufactured to include a port assembly.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5A, sealed vessel 500 includes a plurality of vessel ports<br>
510. Port assembly 202 (including port 205, membrane 220, and tip 215) resides in<br><br>
vessel port 510A after insertion. Vessel 500 remains sealed after insertion of port<br>
assembly 202. Vessel port 510A seals to port 205.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5B, sealed vessel 500 includes a plurality of vessel ports<br>
510. Port assembly 232 (including port 205, membrane 220, and tip 215) resides in<br>
vessel port 510A after vessel manufacture. A process for manufacturing a representative<br>
sealed vessel incorporating a port assembly is described in Example 1.<br>
A representative port assembly useful for incorporation into a sealed vessel during<br>
manufacture is illustrated in FIGURE 6. The port assembly useful for incorporation<br>
during vessel manufacture is substantially the same as the port assembly useful for<br>
introduction into a sealed vessel illustrated in FIGURE 4, except that the assembly useful<br>
in vessel manufacture need not include, and preferably does not include, a feature for<br>
puncturing the vessel. Referring to FIGURE 6, port assembly 232 includes port 205 and<br>
tip 235. Port 205 is a cylinder terminating with window 210 and having opening 212 for<br>
receiving probe member 185 (not shown). In one embodiment, port 205 tapers from<br>
opening 212 to window 210 such that the depth of insertion of probe member 185 into<br>
port 205 is predetermined by the probe's diameter. When inserted in the port, the face of<br>
probe member 185 and window 210 are substantially parallel. Port 205 and tip 235 are<br>
adapted such that the port and tip are reversibly connectable. In one embodiment, port<br>
205 includes annular inset 214 and tip 235 includes opening 216 defined by annular lip<br>
218 for receiving inset 214. In this embodiment, inset 214 has a diameter less than<br>
opening 216. It will be appreciated that the connecting relationship between the port and<br>
tip can be reversed (i.e., port having annular Up for receiving tip having inset). Lip 218<br>
defines bed 222 for receiving substrate 220, which is secured in port assembly 202 when<br>
port 205 is connected to tip 235. Tip 235 includes aperture 224 in bed 222. Aperture 224<br>
provides for contact of substrate 220 with a liquid sample contained in the sealed vessel.<br>
Fluorescent species having pH-dependent emission. The method and system of<br>
the invention for measuring pH uses a fluorescent species having pH-dependent<br>
fluorescent emission. The fluorescent species has a first emission intensity at a first<br>
wavelength and a second emission intensity at a second wavelength, the first and second<br>
emission intensities being characteristic of pH in the environment of the fluorescent<br>
species. The ratio of the first and second emission intensities provides pH measurement.<br>
It is appreciated that fluorescent emission occurs as a wavelength band having a band<br>
maximum that is referred to herein as the emission wavelength.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the separation between the first wavelength and the second<br>
wavelength is at least about 40 nm. In one embodiment, the separation between the first<br>
wavelength and the second wavelength is at least about 30 nm. In one embodiment, the<br>
separation between the first wavelength and the second wavelength is at least about<br>
20 nm. Using 10 nm HBW filters, the separation is at least about 30 nm. Preferably, the<br>
system of the invention achieve fluorescence signal separation by removing any emission<br>
band overlap by 10E5 or more.<br>
The method and system of the invention for measuring pH are not limited to any<br>
particular fluorescent species, nor any particular pH range. The method and system of the<br>
invention is operable with any fluorescent species having pH-dependent properties that<br>
can be excited and its emission measured. The range of pH measurable by the method<br>
and system of the invention can be selected and is determined by the pH-dependent<br>
properties of the fluorescent species.<br>
In addition to their pH-dependent properties noted above, suitable fluorescent<br>
species include those that can be substantially irreversibly immobilized on a substrate.<br>
The fluorescent species can be covalently coupled to the substrate or non-covalently<br>
associated with the substrate.<br>
Suitable pH-dependent fluorescent species include those known in the art.<br>
Representative fluorescent species having suitable pH-dependent properties include<br>
fluorescein derivatives including naphthofluorescein compounds, sermnaphthofluorescein<br>
compounds (e.g., SNAFL compounds), and seminaphthorhodafluor compounds<br>
(e.g., SNARF compounds). These compounds have advantages associated with their long<br>
wavelength emission, which is less susceptible to potential interfering light absorbing<br>
substances in blood. These compounds also have relatively long wavelength absorbance<br>
making them particularly suitable for excitation by commercially available LED light<br>
sources. Another compound having suitable pH dependent behavior is HPTS, 8-hydroxy-<br>
1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid. Although the compound has desired ratiometric<br>
pH properties, excitation is optimal at short wavelength (403 nm) where strong LED light<br>
sources are not commercially available. Representative SNAFL and SNARF compounds<br>
useful in the method and system of the invention are described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,945,171. Molecular Probes (now Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) sells CNF, SNAFL,<br>
SNARF fluors with conjugatable carboxylic acid linker groups, see, for example,<br>
Molecular Probes Handbook (Ninth Edition) by R.P. Haugland, Chapter 21<br><br>
"pH indicators" pages 829-847. Epoch Biosciences (now Nanogen, Bothell, WA) sells<br>
EBIO-3 with a propanoic acid linker. Whitaker et al. (Anal. Biochem. (1991) 194,<br>
330-344) showed the synthesis of a number of SNAFL compounds. Wolfbeis et al.<br>
(Mikrochim Acta (1992) 108, 133-141) described the use of CNF and aminocellulose<br>
conjugates. The earliest reference to the SNAFL family of compounds is Whitaker et al.<br>
(1988) Biophys. J. 53, 197a. A related dye in the CNF family is VITABLUE, a<br>
sulfonenaphthofluorescein derivative (Lee et al (1989) Cytometry 10, 151-164) having a<br>
pKa of 7.56. A CNF analog with bromine substituents at each carbon adjacent to a<br>
phenol (pKa 7.45) has a pKa that is 0.54 pKa units lower than their measured pKa for<br>
CNF (pKa 7.99). Lee et al. note that "true" pKa values are difficult to determine for these<br>
compounds. A method for pKa determination is described in Example 3. SNAFL-1<br>
(literature pKa ~ 7.8) free acid had a pKa of 7.6 in that fluorescence-based assay.<br>
The structures of seminaphthofluorescein compounds (SNAFL-1 and EBIO-3)<br>
useful in the method and system of the invention are illustrated below.<br><br>
The numbering scheme describes position of attachment of linker molecules.<br>
These compounds have carboxylate linking groups suitable for conjugation to carrier<br>
proteins, as described below. For conjugation, the reactive N-hydroxysucinimide (NHS)<br>
ester of SNAFL-1 (commercially available from Molecule Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) can<br>
be used. Conjugation to lysine residues in human serum albumin (HSA) gave desired<br>
SNAFL/HSA conjugates. Carbodiimide activation of EBIO-3 gave a reactive<br>
intermediate that was efficiently conjugated to human serum albumin.<br>
Representative naphthofluorescein and seminaphthofluorescein compounds useful<br>
in the method and system of tine invention are illustrated in FIGURE 7.<br><br>
The SNAFL compounds are commercially available from Molecular Probes, Inc.,<br>
Eugene, OR. The SNAFL compounds can be readily synthesized according to general<br>
procedures that have been published (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,945,171).<br>
The preparation of a representative 2-chloro substituted SNAFL compound is<br>
shown below.<br><br>
The compound can be prepared by condensation of 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene with the<br>
diacid substituted 4-acylresorcinol in the presence of a dehydrating acid or Lewis acid<br>
catalyst, such as Zinc chloride.<br>
The preparation of SNAFL compounds having propionic acid linkers is described<br>
in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/022,039, incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety. A representative SNAFL compounds having a propionic acid linker, EBIO-3, is<br>
commercially available from Nanogen, Bothell WA.<br>
The emission spectra as a function of pH of representative fluorescent species<br>
(i.e., SNAFL-1 and EBIO-1) useful in the method and system of the invention are<br>
illustrated in FIGURES 8 and 9, respectively. FIGURE 8 illustrates the emission spectra<br>
of SNAFL-1 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer as a function of pH (pH 6.0 to 10.0)<br>
(excitation at 540 nm). Referring to FIGURE 8, the response at pH 6-7 is relatively poor<br>
(pKa = 7.6). FIGURE 9 illustrates the emission spectra of EBIO-3 in 50 mM potassium<br>
phosphate buffer as a function of pH (pH 6.0 to 10.0) (excitation at 545 nm). Referring to<br>
FIGURE 9, the response at pH 6-7 is relatively good (pKa = 6.6). Spectral properties and<br>
pKa data for the SNAFL analogs illustrated in FIGURES 7A-7E are summarized in<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 1, absorbance and emission spectra were obtained at 10 µM<br>
SNFL analog. Absorbance was measured at pH 6, 8, and 10: acid (pH 6) gave two bands<br>
of similar absorbance; pH 10 gave a single λmax (base). The emission spectra were<br>
determined by excitation at the absorbance λmax (base). The wavelength where emission<br>
spectra crossed is reported as λiso. The emission λrnax was measured at pH 10. pKa was<br>
determined from fluorescence emission spectra. EBIO-1 and EBIO-3 were more<br>
sensitive to changes at pH ~ 6.5. The other analogs were more sensitive at pH ~ 8.<br>
Fluorescent species conjugates for substrate immobilization. For use in the<br>
method and system of the invention, the fluorescent species is immobilized on a substrate<br>
such that the fluorescent species is in contact with the sample, the pH of which is to be<br>
measured. The fluorescent species can be immobilized on the substrate through the use<br>
of a material (e.g., macromolecular spacer material) having a strong associative<br>
interaction with the substrate. The spacer material allows covalent conjugation of the<br>
fluorescent species and provides large surface area needed for efficient non-covalent<br>
immobilization to the substrate surface. In one embodiment, the spacer material is human<br>
serum albumin (HSA) having -44 lysine residues available for covalent conjugation.<br>
HSA's densely charged molecular structure has a passivating effect when adsorbed to<br>
biomaterials. Other advantages include reduced fluorescence quenching, uniform<br>
environment for the conjugated fluorophore, and availability in recombinant form (from<br>
yeast) so there is no chance of infection (as with HSA from donors). HSA conjugates are<br>
easily purified by ultrafiltration methods and form stable solutions that are easily<br><br>
characterized by absorbance and fluorescence assays to determine the number of<br>
fluorophores per protein.<br>
In one embodiment, the fluorescent species is immobilized on the substrate<br>
through the use of a protein or protein fragment. Suitable proteins include those that can<br>
be substantially irreversibly immobilized on the substrate. The protein can be covalently<br>
coupled to the substrate or non-covalently associated with the substrate. Suitable proteins<br>
include proteins to which the fluorescent species can be substantially irreversibly<br>
immobilized. The fluorescent species can be covalently or non-covalently associated<br>
with the protein.<br>
Suitable proteins include human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin<br>
(BSA), vonWillebrand's factor, kininogen, fibrinogen, and hemoglobin (no iron).<br>
Suitable proteins include proteins having available lysine residues (for conjugation to the<br>
fluorophore) and molecular weight sufficient to allow for immobilization efficiency to the<br>
blot membrane. Other functional groups in the protein (like cysteine) could presumably<br>
be used for covalent bonding to suitably reactive solid supports.<br>
In one embodiment, the fluorescent species is immobilized on the substrate<br>
through the use of a polysaccharide. Suitable polysaccharides include those that can be<br>
substantially irreversibly immobilized on the substrate. The polysaccharide can be<br>
covalently coupled to the substrate or non-covalently associated with the substrate.<br>
Suitable polysaccharides include proteins to which the fluorescent species can be<br>
substantially irreversibly immobilized. The fluorescent species can be covalently or<br>
non-covalently associated with the polysaccharide.<br>
Suitable polysaccharides include dextrans, aminodextrans, heparin, and lectins.<br>
In another embodiment, the fluorescent species is immobilized on the substrate<br>
through the use of dendrimeric structures . Suitable dendrimeric structures include those<br>
that can be substantially irreversibly immobilized on the substrate. The dendrimeric<br>
structures can be covalently coupled to the substrate or non-covalently associated with the<br>
substrate. PAMAM dendrimers are commercially available as are other structural types<br>
and sizes.<br>
In one embodiment, the fluorescent species is covalently coupled to a protein to<br>
provide a fluorophore-protein conjugate that can be immobilized on a substrate. In one<br>
embodiment, the fluorophore-polysaccharide conjugate is non-covalently associated with<br>
the substrate.<br><br>
In one embodiment, a fluorophore-protein conjugate is immobilized on a<br>
substrate. In one embodiment, the fluorescent species is a seminaphthofluorescein and<br>
the protein is human serum albumin. In one embodiment, the seminaphthofluorescein is<br>
SNAFL-1. The preparation of SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates is described in Example 4.<br>
The fluorescent properties of SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates are described in Example 5. In<br>
one embodiment, the seminaphthofluorescein is EBIO-3. The preparation of<br>
EBIO-3/HSA conjugates is described in Example 6. A schematic illustration of the<br>
coupling of EBIO-3 to HSA is illustrated in FIGURE 10. The fluorescent properties of<br>
EBIO-3/HSA conjugates are described in Example 7.<br>
The fluorescent emission spectra as a function of pH (6.0 to 10.0) of a<br>
representative fluorophore-protein conjugate (SNAFL-1/HSA, 1.6 fluorophores per HSA)<br>
useful in the method and system of the invention are illustrated in FIGURE 11.<br>
The fluorescent emission spectra as a function of pH (6.0 to 10.0) of a<br>
representative fluorophore-protein conjugate (EBIO-3/HSA, 1.92 fluorophores per HSA)<br>
useful in the method and system of the invention are illustrated in FIGURE 12.<br>
For the fluorophore-protein conjugate, the optimum fluorophore loading will vary<br>
depending on the particular fluorophore.<br>
For SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates the fluorophore loading can vary from about<br>
0.01 to about 40 SNAFL-1/HSA. Low signal at 0.01 and fluorescent quenching at<br>
40 fluorophores/HSA. In one embodiment, the SNAFL-1 conjugate includes about<br>
2 SNAFL-1/HSA.<br>
For EBIO-3/HSA conjugates the fluorophore loading can vary from about 0.01 to<br>
about 40 EBIO-3/HSA. In one embodiment, the EBIO-3 conjugate includes about<br>
2 EBIO-3/HSA.<br>
Substrates for fluorescent species immobilization. In the method and system of<br>
the invention, the fluorescent species is immobilized on a substrate. As noted above, the<br>
fluorescent species can be directly immobilized on the substrate covalently or by<br>
non-covalent association or, alternatively, through the use of a material<br>
(e.g., fluorophore-protein conjugate) that can be immobilized on the substrate covalently<br>
or by non-covalent association.<br>
Suitable substrates substantially irreversible immobilized the fluorescent species.<br>
In the method of the invention, suitable substrates also do not inhibit the contact of the<br>
liquid sample with the fluorescent species and do not impair or alter the pH measurement.<br><br>
Representative substrates include membranes, such as microporous membranes<br>
made of nitrocellulose, mixed esters of nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate, polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyvinylidene fluoride and polyimide. Such materials are<br>
available commercially from Whatman S&amp;S, Florham Park, NJ and Millipore, Billerica<br>
MA. Suitable membranes include membranes in which the microporous structure is<br>
created by ion beam penetration such as membranes commercially available from<br>
Oxyphen Gmbh, Dresden, Germany under the designation OXYPHEN. Charged nylon<br>
surfaces (Nytran) can also be used. Suitable membranes include plastic membranes in<br>
which the microporous structure is made by injection molding the micropores into the<br>
plastic such as the processes used by Amic, Stockholm, Sweden. Emission intensity of<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA at pH 7 immobilized on various pore size mixed ester nitrocellulose<br>
cellulose acetate membranes is shown in FIGURE 22. -<br>
Immobilization of representative fluorophore protein conjugates on membranes is<br>
described in Examples 8 and 10. Example 8 describes the immobilization of<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates. Example 9 describes the fluorescent properties of<br>
immobilized SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates. Example 10 describes the immobilization of<br>
EBIO-3/HSA conjugates. Example 11 describes the fluorescent properties of<br>
immobilized EBIO-3/HSA conjugates.<br>
The emission spectra of a representative fluorophore-protein conjugate<br>
(SNAFL-1/HSA, 3.6:1) immobilized on Oxyphen and nitrocellulose as a function of pH<br>
(pH response), as measured by the microwell assay described in Example 9, are<br>
illustrated in FIGURES 13 and 14, respectively.<br>
The emission spectra of a representative fluorophore-protein conjugate<br>
(EBIO-3/HSA, 2.0:1) immobilized on nitrocellulose, as described in Example 8, as a<br>
function of pH (6.0, 6.5, 1.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 10.0), as measured by the telescoping tube<br>
insert assay described in Example 11, are illustrated in FIGURE 15. The large spread of<br>
emissions at 600 nm for the pH 6 to 8 range indicates good fluorescence verses<br>
pH response.<br>
Ratiometric pH Method and System. The method of the invention is a fluorescent<br>
wavelength-ratiornetric method. In the method, the first and second fluorescent emission<br>
intensities of the fluorescent species measured at first and second emission wavelengths,<br>
respectively, are ratioed to provide pH information. The first emission wavelength varies<br>
with pH while the second emission wavelength is constant with pH and gives an internal<br><br>
control for the fluorescent intensity. In one embodiment, a lookup table is used to lookup<br>
a combination of the measured ratio, first and second emission wavelength and<br>
determines its corresponding pH. In one embodiment, a mathematical function of the<br>
ratio, first and second emission wavelength is used to calculate the resulting pH.<br>
FIGURE 16 illustrates the data used in the method of the invention for measuring<br>
pH. The emission spectra of a representative fluorophore-protein conjugate<br>
(EBIO-3/HSA, 2:1) immobilized on nitrocellulose at pH 7.0 is shown as measured by the<br>
telescoping tubing insert assay. In this setup, the excitation bandpass filter was unable to<br>
completely remove the excitation light in the emission region as illustrated by the<br>
background signal measured on a blank nitrocellulose disc. The full spectrum corrected<br>
for the background was multiplied by the transmittance of the first and second<br>
hypothetical filters at each wavelength and the area under the resultant curve was<br>
calculated to give a signal for the first and second wavelength. The center wavelengths<br>
and bandwidths of hypothetical filters were chosen such that the ratiometric properties of<br>
the conjugate had the strongest relationship to the pH in the region of interest<br>
FIGURE 17 illustrates the results of the method of the invention for phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS), platelet poor plasma (PPP), and platelet rich plasma (PRP) as<br>
measured by the telescoping tubing insert assay described in Example 11. The three<br>
curves represent the best fit relationship between the measured pH and ratios for the three<br>
different liquids.<br>
FIGURE 18 illustrates the correlation of pH results for three different plasma<br>
samples obtained by the method and system of the invention as measured by the injection<br>
molded insert PVC tube assay described in Example 11. The relationship between the<br>
fluorescent signal and the pH has an accuracy of about 0.1 pH units.<br>
FIGURE 19 illustrates stability of a representative substrate-immobilized<br>
fiuorophore conjugate of the invention (EBIO-3/HSA, 2:1) on mixed ester nitrocellulose<br>
and cellulose acetate prepared by the soaking method and as measured by the leaching<br>
assay described in Example 10. The low level of leaching is far below the toxic level for<br>
any compound.<br>
Carbon dioxide measurement. In another aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
device and method for measuring carbon dioxide concentration in a liquid sample. The<br>
carbon dioxide measuring method utilizes the pH measuring method and system<br>
described above. In the carbon dioxide measuring method and device, a<br><br>
substrate-immobilized fluorescent species as described above is in contact with a<br>
solution, the pH of which is responsive to carbon dioxide level. In addition to being in<br>
contact with the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species, the solution having<br>
pH responsive to carbon dioxide level is in contact with a liquid sample for which the<br>
level of carbon dioxide is to be measured. The solution having pH responsive to carbon<br>
dioxide level is isolated from the liquid sample for which the level of carbon dioxide is to<br>
be measured by a selectively permeable membrane. The membrane is permeable to gases<br>
(e.g., carbon dioxide) and impermeable to other materials (e.g., liquids). Using the<br>
method of measuring pH described above, the pH of the solution responsive to carbon<br>
dioxide concentration in contact with the substrate-immobilized fluorescent species is<br>
measured and correlated with the carbon dioxide level of the sample in contact with that<br>
solution.<br>
The solution having pH response to carbon dioxide level is an aqueous solution<br>
that includes an agent that is reactive toward carbon dioxide and changes the pH of the<br>
solution in response to carbon dioxide concentration. Suitable agents that are reactive<br>
toward carbon dioxide and change the pH of the solution in which they are dissolved<br>
include bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate.<br>
The selectively permeable membrane isolates the solution having pH responsive<br>
to carbon dioxide level from the liquid sample containing carbon dioxide. The membrane<br>
is permeable to carbon dioxide and impermeable to liquids and other solutes. In the<br>
method, carbon dioxide from the liquid sample passes from the liquid sample through the<br>
membrane and into the aqueous solution thereby reacting with the carbon dioxide reactive<br>
agent to alter the pH of the aqueous solution. Suitable selectively permeable membranes<br>
include membranes made from silicone and PTFE.<br>
FIGURE 20 illustrates a representative device of the invention for measuring<br>
carbon dioxide in a sealed vessel. Referring to FIGURE 20, device 600 includes port<br>
assembly 610 including port 620 and tip 630. Port 620 is a cylinder terminating with<br>
window 622 and having opening 624 for receiving probe member 185. When inserted in<br>
the port, the face of probe member 185 and window 622 are substantially parallel.<br>
Port 620 and tip 630 are adapted such that the port and tip are reversibly connectable.<br>
Substrate 640 including immobilized fluorescent species is secured within port 620 and<br>
tip 630. Tip 630 includes a chamber 645 for receiving a solution having pH<br>
responsiveness to carbon dioxide. Chamber 645 is defined by window 622, tip 630, and<br><br>
selectively permeable membrane 650. Chamber 645 includes substrate 640, which is<br>
interrogated by probe member 185.<br>
A device for measuring carbon dioxide was assembled as described above with<br>
the membrane containing immobilized EBIO-3/rHSA conjugate (rHSA is recombinant<br>
HSA). A layer of PARAFILM M, a blend of olefin-type materials, was added under the<br>
membrane towards the tip. The membrane was hydrated with 5 ul of 35 mM carbonate<br>
buffer (pH 7.4), which was sealed within the assembly by the PARAFILM M and<br>
remained hydrated throughout the assay. The assembly was subjected to 100% carbon<br>
dioxide gas by connection to the gas source with tubing and a "Y" adapter to bleed off the<br>
pressure. The assembly was subjected to the carbon dioxide for an allotted period of<br>
time, allowed to acclimate to ambient air conditions, and repeated. The fluorescence was<br>
measured at each stage at 568 nm and 600 nm after being excited at 525 nm. The results<br>
are summarized below in Table 2 and reflect changes in fluorescence due to the change in<br>
carbon dioxide concentration demonstrating that the fluorometric ratio method of the<br>
invention can also be used to calculate carbon dioxide concentration. The PVC storage<br>
bags that are used for platelet storage are somewhat gas permeable, and carbon dioxide is<br>
directly related to the measurement of pH.<br><br>
The present invention provides a fluorescence-based pH indicator that can be<br>
easily inserted into the sampling ports of designed blood storage bags and interrogated<br>
using a fiber optic-based LED light source and photodiode measurement system. This<br>
solid state system uses a "ratiometric" calibration method that accounts for variability in<br>
fluorescent signal strength due to interfering substances in blood that may interfere with<br>
the amount of excitation light that hits the indicator dye. The ratio of fluorescence<br><br>
intensities are measured at two wavelengths, one to detect the acid (protonated) isomer of<br>
the dye and one to detect the base (deprotonated) isomer.<br>
To develop an accurate pH detector for platelet rich plasma, compounds having<br>
pKa of ~ 6.6 are suitable, for example, 2-chloro substitution of SNAFL compound lowers<br>
the pKa of the phenol from 1.6 to ~ 6.6. Conjugates of these compounds can be<br>
immobilized to various solid supports to provide sensing pH membranes.<br>
The present invention provides an inexpensive, easy to manufacture pH sensing<br>
membrane that gives accurate measurement of pH in platelet storage bags at pH 6.5-7.5.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention uses a protein conjugate (human serum albumin) of a<br>
2-chloro substituted ratiometric fluorescent compound. The fluorophore:HSA ratio was<br>
optimized for performance when immobilized to a nitrocellulose blot membrane. After<br>
drying on the membrane, the fluorophore:HSA conjugate has very low leaching rates.<br>
Discs of this material are easily assembled into holders for insertion into the sampling<br>
ports of platelet storage bags. The fluorescent membrane materials showed good pH<br>
response using a green LED based fmorometer. In the method, two emission<br>
wavelengths for ratiometric pH detection are measured with properly filtered photodiodes<br>
with an accuracy of ~0.1 units at the desired low pH threshold of 6.5.<br>
Fluorescent probe molecules can be designed to be sensitive to a variety of<br>
environments. The method and system of the invention describes the use of pH-sensitive<br>
fluorophores. However, other environments can be interrogated by the method and<br>
system of the invention modified to include environment-sensitive fluorophores other<br>
than pH-sensitive fluorophores. A variety of fluorescent probes that change fluorescent<br>
properties as the molecular environment changes are commercially available. See, for<br>
example, Molecular Probes Handbook (9thEdition) by R.P. Haugland. Probes can be<br>
linked to albumins or other proteins and used to prepare substrates for interrogation as<br>
described in herein or using other fluorescent-based methods. Examples of environment-<br>
sensitive fluorophores, systems, and methods include the following.<br>
Nucleic acid detection: nucleic acid binding dyes change fluorescent properties in<br>
the presence of DNA or KNA.<br>
Enzyme substrates: proteins or peptides can be labeled with fluorescent dyes and<br>
fluorescent quenching molecules such that a fluorescent signal is generated in the<br>
presence of particular enzymes such as proteases (FRET detection).<br><br>
Probes for lipids: lipophilic dyes can change fluorescent properties in the<br>
presence of cell membranes or other lipid rich analytes.<br>
Probes for oxygen: in addition to pH detection and carbon dioxide detection,<br>
certain fluorescent molecules are sensitive to changes in oxygen concentration, for<br>
example, tris(2,2'-bipyridiyl)ruthenium(H) dichloride (RTDP).<br>
Indicators for metal ions: fluorescent dyes that bind metals can change<br>
fluorescent properties upon binding calcium, magnesium, zinc, sodium, potassium,<br>
among other.<br>
Glucose detection: certain lectins such as ConA bind glucose, and suitably<br>
labeled lectins can be prepared as probes for glucose.<br>
The following examples are provided for the purposes of illustrating, not limiting,<br>
the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
The Manufacture of a Vessel Incorporating a Representative Substrate-Immobilized<br>
Fluorescent Species<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5B, sealed vessel 500 is manufactured from PVC. PVC<br>
material is compounded with a number of additives, for example, plasticizers, stabilizers,<br>
and lubricants. The formulation is used for making bags and tubes. The compounded<br>
PVC is extruded through a die for converting the plasticized material into sheet form.<br>
The extruded sheet, after slitting, is cut into the desired size and sent to the welding<br>
section. The donor and transfer tubings are made by extrusion of similar PVC<br>
compounds. The tubes are then cut to the appropriate length and sent to the welding<br>
section. The components, such as transfusion ports, needle covers, and clamp, are<br>
produced by injection molding. The components are ultrasonically cleaned and dried in a<br>
drying oven.<br>
"Welding. The blood bags are fabricated by a high frequency welding technique.<br>
Sized PVC sheets are placed between electrodes and high frequency at high voltage is<br>
applied. PVC gets heated very rapidly and sealing takes place between electrodes.<br>
Transfusion ports and donor and transfer tubing are kept in the appropriate position with<br>
the bag and welded to form an integral part of the blood bag system. For the manufacture<br>
of a vessel incorporating a representative substrate-immobilized fluorescent species<br>
(FIGURE 5B), an open tube is welded to provide port 510A. The tube can be made of<br><br>
colored PVC to provide light protection for the immobilized fluorescent species. Welded<br>
bags are trimmed. The port assembly 232 (FIGURE 6) is manufactured from injection<br>
molded Lexan parts (205 and 235) and a 3.53 mm (9/64 inch) diameter nitrocellulose disc<br>
with immobilized fluorescent species (220). The port assembly is held together by<br>
friction fit or can be glued in place. The port assembly is inserted in the open tube of port<br>
510A. The port assembly is held in the port by friction fit or can be glued in place. The<br>
assembled bag and port assembly is sterilized and labeled for ultimate storage of platelet<br>
concentrates.<br>
Example 2<br>
The Incorporation of a Representative Substrate-Immobilized<br>
Fluorescent Species into a Sealed Vessel<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5 A, sealed vessel 500 includes a plurality of vessel ports<br>
510. Port assembly 202 resides in vessel port 510A after insertion. The port assembly<br>
202 (FIGURES 4A-4C) is manufactured from injection molded Lexan parts (205 and<br>
215) and a 3.53 mm (9/64 inch) diameter nitrocellulose disc with immobilized fluorescent<br>
species (220). The port assembly is held together by friction fit or can be glued in place.<br>
The port assembly is inserted through the septum seal inside port 510A by puncturing the<br>
seal with the spiked tip. Alternatively, the seal can be pre-punctured with a separate<br>
spike tool. The insertion of the port assembly can be performed on either empty or<br>
platelet filled bags, but in either case, aseptic methods should be used to avoid possible<br>
contamination of the bag contents. The port assembly is held in the port by friction fit or<br>
can be glued in place. Vessel 500 remains sealed (leakproof) after insertion of port<br>
assembly 202 in port 510A.<br>
Example 3<br>
Fluorescence and pH Properties of Representative SNAFL Analogs:<br>
pKa determination<br>
Instrumentation. Fluorescence versus pH of various SNAFL free acids were<br>
compared using an Ocean Optics USB2000 fiber optic spectrometer and a tungsten<br>
halogen light source (part number HL-2000 FHSA). The light source was equipped with<br>
a linear variable filter that allowed the wavelength and shape of the excitation beam to be<br>
adjusted. The excitation wavelength was adjusted by using a blank cuvette to the<br>
absorbance max of the fluorophore (see Table 1). A cuvette holder (part number<br>
CUV-FL-DA) was directly attached to the light source and a fiber optic cable directed<br><br>
emitted light to the spectrometer. Excitation conditions are reported for each<br>
fluorescence spectrum (3000 msec irradiation at the indicated wavelength). Spectral data<br>
were collected on a personal computer using the Ocean Optics software and overlays of<br>
different spectra were captured.<br>
Sample preparation. SNAFL-1 was purchased as the free carboxylic acid from<br>
Molecular Probes in a 1 mg vial. 0.3 mL of isopropyl alcohol and 0.7 mL of water was<br>
added to make a 1 mg/mL solution. A molecular weight (MW) of 426 for SNAFL-1 was<br>
used to calculate molarity (SNAFL-1 = 2.35 mM). 4.25 uL of this solution was diluted to<br>
1 mL with various 50 mM phosphate buffers to give 10 micromolar solutions with<br>
pH 6-10. 10 micromolar solutions of SNAFL-2 (MW= 460) were prepared in a similar<br>
fashion. EBIO-1 (MW=523), EBIO-2 (MW=627), and EBIO-3 (MW=489) were<br>
obtained as bulk compounds from Epoch Biosciences. 1.6 mg of each solid powder was<br>
carefully weighed out and dissolved in 3.2 mL of 40% isopropyl alcohol to give<br>
0.5 mg/mL solutions. Emission spectra were obtained for the various SNAFL and<br>
EBIO compounds at pH 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, 8.0 and 10.0. Examples of overlayed<br>
fluorescence emission spectra are shown in FIGURE 8 (SNAFL-1) and FIGURE 9<br>
(EBIO-3). All spectra showed an isosbestic wavelength where all emission spectra<br>
overlap (See Table 1). This is a characteristic of ideal ratiometric performance with no<br>
competing fluorescent structures other than those shown above (lactone, naphthol,<br>
naphtholate).<br>
pKa calculations. The pH at which two molecular species (tautomers) are equally<br>
represented is defined as the pKa. There are many variables that can affect pKa and<br>
methods for measurement are difficult since the structures have overlapping absorbance.<br>
Therefore direct comparisons from the literature can vary slightly. The calculations<br>
contained herein are based on the assumption that, at pH 10, only the trianionic<br>
naphtholate structure is present. The intensity of fluorescence at the emission maxima is<br>
divided by 2, and pH of the intersecting pH curve is calculated by interpolation between<br>
the nearest 2 curves. The pKa of the 2-chloro substituted EBIO compounds is<br>
significantly lower than the other analogs as shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
The Preparation of Representative Fluorophore-Protein Conjugates: SNAFL-1/HSA<br>
Human serum albumin (HSA) was purchased from Sigma (catalog # A-8763) as<br>
100 mg of lyophilized powder. SNAFL-1 NHS ester was purchased from Molecular<br>
Probes as a mixture of the 5 and 6 isomers. A solution of 10 mg (0.15 micromoles) of<br>
HSA in 1 mL of pH 8.56 sodium bicarbonate (0.1 M) was prepared. A solution of 1 mL<br>
(1.91 micromoles) of the NHS ester in 0.1 mL of dirnethylsulfoxide was prepared. 0.3 mL<br>
aliquots of the HSA solution were transferred to a 1.6 mL Eppendorf tubes and various<br>
offering ratios of the NHS ester solution were added: tube 1, 11.8 microliters<br>
(5 equivalents); tube 2, 23.6 microliters (10 equivalents), tube 3, 47.1 microliters<br>
(20 equivalents). The deep red solutions were vortexed and allowed to stand in the dark<br>
for at least one hour. The 5:1 conjugate from tube 1 was purified by gel filtration<br>
chromatography on a 0.5 x 20 cm column packed with Sephadex G-15 and<br>
pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The conjugate was isolated as a fast moving red<br>
/ orange band in PBS and diluted to 0.75 mL with PBS to give a 4 mg/mL solution of the<br>
protein conjugate. Most of the color eluted with the conjugate, but some small molecular<br>
weight (orange) impurities remained on top of the column. The column was clean<br>
enough to be re-used for purification of the 10:1 and 20:1 conjugates. Each was eluted in<br>
PBS and diluted to 0.75 mL to give ~4 mg/mL solutions (60 micromolar based on HSA<br>
component). The red solutions were stored refrigerated and protected from light.<br>
1 micromolar solutions of each SNAFL-1 / HSA conjugate were prepared and analyzed<br>
by UV-vis spectra using a Beckman DU640B spectrometer. Each spectrum showed<br>
absorbance maxima at 490 and 521 nm at pH 7 as expected for the acid form of<br>
SNAFL-1 conjugates. The relative absorbance showed the expected change in<br>
absorbance with different SNAFL:HSA offering ratio. A 10 micromolar solution of<br>
SNAFL-1 acid (obtained from Molecular Probes) at pH 7 was used as a standard to more<br>
accurately determine the average loading of SNAFL-1 per each HSA conjugate<br>
preparation. Using this assay, the 5:1 conjugate had 4.1 fluors/HSA, the 10:1 conjugate<br>
had 6.4 fluors/HSA, and the 20:1 conjugate had 11.2 fluors /HSA.<br><br>

Relative fluorescence of various SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates and SNAFL-1 free<br>
acid were compared using an Ocean Optics USB2000 fiber optic spectrometer and a<br>
tungsten halogen light source (part number HL-2000 FHSA). The light source was<br>
equipped with a linear variable filter that allowed the wavelength and shape of the<br>
excitation beam to be adjusted. A cuvette holder (part number CUV-FL-DA) was<br>
directly attached to the light source and a fiber optic cable directed emitted light to the<br>
spectrometer. Excitation conditions are reported for each fluorescence spectrum<br>
(3000 msec irradiation at the indicated wavelength). Spectral data were collected on a<br>
personal computer using the Ocean Optics software and overlays of different spectra were<br>
captured. A comparison of various loading levels of SNAFL-1/HSA showed that 4.1 to<br>
1.6 SNAFL-1 molecules gave about the same fluorescent signal. Higher loading or lower<br>
loading conjugates gave lower signals.<br>
Emission spectra were obtained for 10 micromolar solutions in potassium<br>
phosphate buffer. Excitation was at 540 run. Emission maximum at 620 ran was<br>
observed for the base form of SNAFL-1 (pH 10). As expected, intensity of 620 nm<br>
fluorescence decreased as pH decreased. An isosbestic point at 585 nm, where<br>
fluorescence remained constant at all pH, was observed. Response was good at about<br>
pH 8, but poor between pH 6-7.<br>
Spectra obtained for a 2.5 micromolar solution of a representative SNAFL-1/HSA<br>
conjugate (1.6 SNAFL-1/HSA) showed improved pH response for pH 6-7 (see<br>
FIGURE 11). The Ocean Optics halogen light source was equipped with a 532 nm<br>
interference filter (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ.) and this allowed the fluorescent<br>
isosbestic point at 572 nm for pH 6-7 to be detected. Emission maximum at 620 nm was<br>
observed for the base form of SNAFL-1 (see pH 10 curve). As expected, intensity of<br>
620 nm fluorescence decreased as pH decreased. In comparison to the free SNAFL-1<br>
carboxylic acid (see FIGURE 8) improved response for pH 6-7 was observed for the HSA<br>
conjugate. A red shift of the pH 8 and 10 curves from the isosbestic wavelength was<br>
observed, indicative of other competing molecular structures involving the fluorescent<br>
species. This non-ideal behavior may be eliminated by use of a longer linker structure or<br>
a more hydrophilic linker structure between the fluorescent dye and the HSA spacer.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
The Preparation of Representative Fluorophore-Protein Conjugates: EBIO-3/HSA<br>
Method A. A 0.1 M stock solution of EDC (Sigma/Aldrich Chemical Co., St.<br>
Louis MO) was prepared by dissolving 6.2 mg of EDC in 0.2 mL of DMF and 0.123 mL<br>
of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.8). 1.0 mg of EBIO-3 acid (Nanogen, Bothell, WA)<br>
was dissolved in 0.102 mL of DMF t0o give a 20 mM solution. 3.0 mg<br>
(0.045 micromoles) of HSA (Sigma/Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved<br>
in 0.3 mL of pH 8.5 sodium bicarbonate in each of two 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes.<br>
0.1MEDC (0.045 mL) was added to 20 mM EBIO-3 (0.045 mL, 0.9 micromoles) in a<br>
separate Eppendorf tube and this was added to one of the HSA tubes to give an<br>
EBIO-3:HSA offering ratio of 20:1. An offering ratio of 5:1 was used in the other HSA<br>
tube by adding a premixed solution of 0.0225 mL of EDC (0.1 mM) and 0.0225 mL of<br>
EBIO-3 (20 mM). The homogeneous dark red HSA conjugate solutions were incubated<br>
at room temperature in the dark. After 21 hours, each of the HSA conjugates was<br>
purified on a G15 Sephadex column as. described above for the SNAFL conjugates<br>
(Example 4). Some unreacted EBIO-3 acid remained at the top of the column (especially<br>
for the 20:1 offering ratio), but was cleanly separated from the desired protein conjugate<br>
that eluted first as a pink fraction in ~0.5 mL of pH 7.4 buffer. Each of the purified<br>
conjugates was diluted to 0.75 mL with pH 7.4 PBS to give 4 mg/mL solutions<br>
(0.06 mM). The red solutions were stored refrigerated and protected from light.<br>
1 micromolar solutions of each EBIO-3 / HSA conjugate were prepared at pH 7.4 and<br>
analyzed by UV-vis spectra using a Beckman DU640B spectrometer. The free EBIO-3<br>
acid (10 micromolar) spectrum had absorbance maximum at 534 run, the 20:1 conjugate<br>
had absorbance at 538 nm and the 5:1 conjugate had maximum at 545 nm. The spectra<br>
showed the expected increase in absorbance with increasing EBIO-3 :HSA offering ratio.<br>
Using this EBIO-3 acid as a standard, the 20:1 conjugate had 5.07 EBIO-3 :HSA and the<br>
5:1 offering had 1.92 EBIO-3:HSA. The coupling efficiency was somewhat lower than<br>
for the SNAFL/HSA conjugates of Example 4 (the 20:1 conjugate had 11.2 fluors/HSA<br>
and the 5:1 offering had 4.1 fiuors/HAS). The EDC coupling method was suitably<br>
efficient and reproducible.<br>
Method B. A 0.1 M solution of EDC (Sigma/Aldrieh Chemical Co., St. Louis,<br>
MO) is prepared by dissolving 6.0 mg of EDC in 0.194 mL of DMF and 0,118 mL of 50<br>
mM PBS (pH 7.4). 3.0 mg of EBIO-3 acid (Nanogen, Bothell, WA) is dissolved in 0.306<br><br>
mL of DMF to give a 20 mM solution. The two solutions are combined in the EBIO-3<br>
solution container and incubated at room temperature for one hour in the dark. 75.0 mg<br>
(1 micromole) of liquid recombinant HSA (rHSA) from yeast (Delta Biotechnology, Ltd.,<br>
Nottingham, UK) is mixed with 7.5 mL of pH 8.5 sodium bicarbonate in a 15 mL conical<br>
tube. The entire contents of the EBIO-3/EDC solution are combined with the rHSA<br>
solution and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15-20 hours. The<br>
rHSA/EBIO-3 conjugate is purified using the Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell system<br>
and a YM10 membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) is used as the<br>
wash solution. After purification, the protein concentration of the conjugate is measured<br>
using the BCA™ Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). An aliquot of the conjugate is<br>
diluted to 1 mg/ml with 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) based on its BCA determined protein<br>
concentration. The 1 mg/ml aliquot of conjugate, the last milliliter of PBS effluent, an<br>
aliquot of the 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4), and an aliquot of the EB3 Standard (15 mM EBIO-3<br>
solution in DMF and 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4)) are analyzed via an absorbance scan utilizing<br>
Bio-Tek's Synergy HT plate reader. The scan is taken on 300 microliters of each of the<br>
above mentioned samples in a black, 96-well, clear, flat bottom plate, scanned from<br>
450 nm to 650 nm. Their max peaks are recorded and used to determine purity and<br>
quality of the conjugate.<br>
Example 7<br>
The Fluorescent Properties of Representative Fluorophore-Protein Conjugates:<br>
EBIO-3/HSA<br>
Fluorescence spectra were obtained for 2.5 micromolar solutions of the two<br>
EBIO-3/HSA conjugates prepared as described in Example 6 (Method A). The<br>
conjugates showed improved pH response for pH 6-7 (see FIGURE 12 for overlayed<br>
spectra for the 1.92:1 EBIO-3/HSA conjugate). The Ocean Optics halogen light source<br>
was equipped with a 532 nm bandpass filter (Edmund Optics, Barrington NJ.) and this<br>
allowed the fluorescent isosbestic point at ~565 nm for pH 6-7 to be detected. Emission<br>
maximum at 605 nm was observed for the base form of SNAFL-1 (red trace, pH 10). As<br>
expected, intensity of 605 nm fluorescence decreased as pH decreased. In comparison to<br>
the SNAFL-1/HSA conjugate (see FIGURE 11) improved response for pH 6-7 was<br>
observed for the EBIO-3 /HSA conjugate. A red shift of the pH 8 and 10 curves from the<br>
isosbestic wavelength was observed, indicative of other competing molecular structures<br><br>
involving the fluorescent species, but was of smaller magnitude than for the<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA conjugate.<br>
Example 8<br>
Immobilization of Representative Fluorophore-Protein Conjugates: SNAFL-1/HSA<br>
Fluorophore-protein conjugates and fluorophore-carbohydrate conjugates were<br>
immobilized on either nitrocellulose or capillary pore membranes using the following<br>
general method. Fluorescein labeled dextrans with "fixable" lysine residues were<br>
obtained from Molecular Probes. These dextrans had a molecular weight of about 10,000<br>
1.8 fluorophores per conjugate, and 2.2 lysines per conjugate and are sold under the trade<br>
name "FIuoro-Emerald". Fluorescein labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also<br>
obtained from Molecular Probes and had 4.5 fluors per conjugate. Various<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates were prepared as described in Example 4. Nitrocellulose<br>
membranes were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell under the trade name PROTRAN.<br>
Pore diameter was reported as 0.2 microns. Capillary pore membranes made from<br>
polyester films were obtained from Oxyphen in a variety of pore sizes. 0.1 micron and<br>
1.0 micron pore size membranes were successfully used to immobilize fluorescein<br>
dextrans. Fluorescein/dextran, fluorescein/BSA and SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates were all<br>
successfully immobilized and the fluorescent properties of the SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates<br>
were fully characterized as described as follows.<br>
General Immobilization Method. SNAFL-1/HSA (2.5 SNAFL-1/HSA) on<br>
0.1 micron pore diameter Oxyphen Membrane Discs. Fluorescent HSA conjugates with a<br>
2.5:1 SNAFL-1:HSA offering ratio were prepared as described in Example 4 and diluted<br>
to provide concentrations of 0.05, 0.2, 1.0 and 4 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) (pH 7.4). 5 microliter drops were applied via a 20 microliter pipettor to the center<br>
of pre-punched porous discs (1/4 inch diameter) that were laid on a bench top. The<br>
spotted discs were allowed to air dry (about 30 minutes) and then placed in separate<br>
desiccators overnight. The dried discs were washed in separate Eppendorf tubes with<br>
2x1 mL of PBS and allowed to soak overnight in 1 mL of PBS. The washed discs were<br>
stable in PBS solution (no degradation after 30 days). Alternatively the discs could be re-<br>
dried in desiccators and stored dry. The wet or dry stored discs had comparable<br>
fluorescent properties. The discs had fluorescent signals that were proportional to the<br>
concentration of labeled macromolecule applied to each one as measured by the<br>
fluorescence assay described in Example 9.<br><br>
Example 9<br>
The Fluorescent Properties of Representative Immobilized Fluorophore-Protein<br>
Conjugates:<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA<br>
Microwell assay of fluorescent macromolecular conjugates on porous membrane<br>
discs using a fiber optic spectrometer. Fluorescent discs prepared as described in<br>
Example 8 were examined for fluorescent properties using the Ocean Optics fiber optic<br>
spectrometer described in Example 5. The cuvette on the light source was replaced by a<br>
fiber optic reflectance probe which had 6 excitation fibers wrapped around a single fiber<br>
that picks up the emitted light from the sample and sends it to the spectrometer. The<br>
reflectance probe was threaded through a hole in a 12x12x18 inch, black box with a lid on<br>
the front. The probe was clamped inside under a 1 cm square opening that allowed the tip<br>
of the probe to be positioned under a 96-well micro well plate (clear bottom black plate).<br>
The probe was tilted at a 30 degree angle to reduce reflected light entering the probe tip.<br>
The fluorescent disc of interest was placed in the bottom of a well and covered with<br>
300 microliters of the analyte solution of interest. The excitation light source was turned<br>
on long enough to position the disc of interest over the tip of the reflectance probe, then<br>
the shutter was closed and the plate was covered with another box to shield the disc from<br>
ambient light. Unless otherwise mentioned, the Ocean Optics software was set to collect<br>
data with a 3000 msec integration time and 3 averages. A dark spectrum was captured<br>
with the shutter closed and used for all background subtracted readings during the assay.<br>
The shutter was then opened and fluorescent reading of the disc was started. The<br>
graphical display on the computer screen gave real-time spectra after each 3000 msec<br>
integration time. After the required 3 spectra were obtained (about 10 seconds) the<br>
graphical display showed only subtle changes. At this point a snapshot of the displayed<br>
spectrum was captured and saved to disc for future processing. The shutter was closed,<br>
and the next microwell experiment was set up. The same disc could be measured<br>
multiple times by exchanging the analyte solution in the microwells. Alternatively,<br>
different discs in different wells could be measured by re-positioning the microwell plate<br>
over the reflectance probe.<br>
Fluorescent loading of SNAFL-1/HSA immobilized on Oxvphen discs. The<br>
microwell assay described above was used to compare the relative-fluorescence of<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA on Oxyphen discs. The excitation filters in the halogen light source were<br><br>
set to a wavelength of 532 nm and a "wide open" bandpass position to maximize<br>
sensitivity of the assay. Reflectance of the excitation beam back into the detector fiber<br>
was significant, and the wavelength position of the filter was adjusted to provide a<br>
"minimum' at 620 nm where the fluorescence from the base form of SNAFL-1/HSA is<br>
greatest. The various concentrations of SNAFL-1/HSA described in Example 8 were<br>
examined in separate microwells in pH 7 potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM) as<br>
described above. The spectra showed the ability to distinguish relative fluorescence<br>
intensity of 4, 1, 0.2 and 0.05 mg/mL membranes at pH 7. All had signal greater than<br>
background.<br>
Relative fluorescence intensity of various amounts of SNAFL-1/HSA f2.S:l)<br>
immobilized on porous Oxyphen discs at pH 7. The fluorescent intensity was measured<br>
at 620 nm, the fluorescent maximum of the base form of the fluorophore. Excitation used<br>
a wide open setting on the halogen lamp that efficiently excites both acid and base forms<br>
of SNAFL-1. The reflected light from the source (unmodified disc) had the lowest<br>
intensity spectrum. The spectrum of the 0.05 mg/mL disc gave a small increase in<br>
fluorescence intensity. The 0.2 mg/mL disc, 1 mg/mL disc, and 4 mg/mL disc showed<br>
stepwise increases in fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence spectra of two 30 day PBS<br>
soaked sample (1 mg/mL) from a different batch of membranes were essentially the same<br>
and showed that membrane loading was reproducible from batch to batch, and that the<br>
SNAFL-1/HSA conjugates did not dissociate significantly from the disc surface in<br>
PBS solution.<br>
pH Dependent fluorescence of SNAFL-1 / HSA immobilized on Oxvphen discs.<br>
The 1 mg/mL SNAFL-1/HSA discs described above were examined for pH dependent<br>
response in the microwell assay. A single disc was examined in potassium phosphate<br>
buffers of pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The data showed that these membrane discs had a<br>
wide dynamic range of pH measurement, but had more sensitive response at pH &gt; 6. The<br>
time between buffer exchanges was 5 min, and there was no significant change in spectra<br>
after additional equilibration time. This showed that the response time for even dramatic<br>
changes in the pH environment of the immobilized SNAFL-1 / HSA conjugates is rapid.<br>
"Crossover assay" for fluorescence measurement of r&gt;H using SNAFL-1/HSA<br>
Oxyphen discs. The microwell assay described above was used to examine the<br>
fluorescent isosbestic properties of the discs. For this assay, the shutter assembly in<br>
Ocean Optics halogen light source (part number HL-2000 FHSA) was removed, and two<br><br>
532 run bandpass filters (Edmund Scientific) were inserted in the cavity using a special<br>
adaptor. This dramatically reduced the reflected background in the spectral region of<br>
interest (&gt; 550 nm). The data shown are for 4 mg/mL loading discs prepared with<br>
SNAFL:HSA (5:1) conjugate. The immobilized protein conjugate showed unusual pH<br>
vs. fluorescence properties in comparison to the solution phase data. Instead of a<br>
fluorescent isosbestic point at 575 nm, there was a stepwise increase in the fluorescent<br>
intensity as pH increased. The pH 10 spectrum showed the expected maximum at<br>
620 nm, and crossed the overlaid spectral curves obtained in pH 4, 6, 7 and 8 buffers.<br>
These "crossover points" were used as the basis for a sensitive assay to determine pH of<br>
the membrane environment. Three different membrane discs were examined using this<br>
assay format on three different days. The crossover points were reproducible within<br>
2nm.<br>
The 4 mg/mL discs (3.6:1 SNAFL-1:HSA) showed stepwise increase in<br>
pH 10 "crossover". The crossover was at 579 nm for pH 4. Three discs/three different<br>
days gave the same result ± 2 nm. The crossover points were at 592 nm (pH 6), 600 nm<br>
(pH 7a,b), and 611 nm (pH 8). The fluorescent maximum at pH 10 was at 620 nm,<br>
similar to the solution phase properties.<br>

Immobilization of Representative Fluorophore-Protein Conjugates: EBIQ-3/HSA<br>
Spotting Immobilization Method. EBIO-3/HSA conjugate was prepared as<br>
described in Example 6 at a ratio of 2:1. Nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from<br>
Schleicher and Schuell under the trade name PROTRAN. The discs were treated in the<br>
same way as the general immobilization method described in Example 5 using a 4 mg/ml<br>
solution of EBIO-3/HSA.<br>
Soaking Immobilization Method. EBIO-3/HSA conjugate was prepared as<br>
described in Example 6 at a ratio of 2:1. Mixed ester nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate<br>
membranes were obtained from Millipore under the product series TF. The EBIO-3/HSA<br>
conjugate is diluted to 0.2 mg/ml and 45 ml is added to a 9 cm disc of the membrane.<br>
The disc is agitated overnight at room temperature and protected from light. The<br>
unbound conjugate is removed and the disc is washed with two 1 hour washes and one<br>
overnight wash all with agitation. The disc is then desiccated and stored dry. Smaller<br>
discs are punched from the 9 cm disc for studies.<br><br>

Conjugates:<br>
EBIO-3/HSA<br>
Telescoping tubing insert assay of fluorescent macromolecular conjugates on<br>
porous membrane discs using a fiber optic spectrometer. Fluorescent discs prepared as<br>
described in Example 10 were examined to relate the fluorescent properties to the liquid<br>
phase pH using the Ocean Optics fiber optic spectrometer described in Example 9 with<br>
the dual 532 nm filtered (Edmund Scientific) halogen light source (part number HL-2000<br>
FHSA). A holder for a 5/32 inch membrane disc was crafted with 4 mm OD and 5 mm<br>
OD polystyrene telescoping tubing and an angled 0.015 in thick polystyrene window.<br>
The angled window was placed so that it held the membrane disc at a 60 degree angle<br>
relative to the tubing axis. This allows the fiber optic probe to be placed in one end of the<br>
tubing and interrogate the disc on the other side of the window which is contact with a<br>
liquid of a certain pH. Buffers of known pH values were placed in contact with the<br>
telescoping tubing inserts and discs made by the spotting immobilization method in<br>
Example 10 and fluorescent emissions recorded with the Ocean Optics software set to<br>
collect data with a 1000 msec integration time and 3 averages.<br>
For liquids with unknown pH values, a stirred and light protected vessel<br>
containing 5 telescoping tubing inserts and discs made by the soaking immobilization<br>
method in Example 10, 50 mL of buffer or plasma, and a calibrated pH electrode (ROSS<br>
electrode/Orion 720a meter) was used to study the pH and fluorescent response of the<br>
fluorescent discs. Drops of 1 N HC1 or 1 M NaOH were added to create a range of pHs<br>
from liquids studied. Fluorescent spectra were collected through Ocean Optics macros in<br>
Excel set to read for 1000 msec integration time and three averages. The spectra were<br>
analyzed using the modeled bandpass filters and ratiometric method in Excel to obtain<br>
calibration curves for PBS, platelet poor plasma and platelet rich plasma.<br>
Injection molded insert PVC tube assay of fluorescent macromolecular conjugates<br>
on porous membrane discs using a custom optimized fluorescence based pH detector.<br>
Injection molded polycarbonate parts were fashioned to fix the fluorescent discs to the<br>
fluorescence pH detector probe as pictured in FIGURE 4. Membranes were prepared as<br>
described in the soaking immobilization method in Example 10 and assembled into the<br>
plastic insert. A 1 in long and 3/16 in ID PVC tube was placed on the spike end of the<br><br>
insert such that 250 ul of Liquid was placed in the tube and covered with parafilm to slow<br>
carbon dioxide desorption. A fluorescent measurement of the first and second<br>
wavelengths was taken and then the pH was read by a blood gas analyzer (Bayer 348).<br>
The pH of plasma samples were adjusted by acid and base additions as in the telescoping<br>
tubing insert assay to create the range of pH data.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
