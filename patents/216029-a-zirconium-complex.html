BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain heterocyclic diamides, their N-oxides, suitable salts and compositions, and a method of their use for controlling invertebrate pests in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments.<br>
" The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

For example, C1-C3 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(O.CH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; 25      and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2.<br>
In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, all substituents are attached to these rings through any available carbon or 30     nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a compound is. substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g. (R)i_j, then the number of substituents may be selected from the 55      integers between i and j inclusive.<br>
The term "optionally substituted with one to three substituents" and the like indicates that one to three of the available positions on the group may be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be"hydrogen, for example R1 or ~R5, then, when this<br><br>
WO 02/070483<br><br>
PCT7US02/06582<br><br>
7<br>
suhstituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula I, TV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form TV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form //-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form TV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of TV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and w-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alky! hydroperoxides such as /-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and^dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of TV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimrnett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 43, pp 149-161, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. H. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br>
The salts of the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, furnaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. The salts of the compounds of the invention also include those formed with organic bases (e.g., pyridine, ammonia, or triethylamine) or inorganic bases (e.g., hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or barium) when the compound contains an acidic group such as a carboxylic acid or phenol.<br><br>

As noted above, J is a phenyl ring, a naphthyl ring system, a 5- or 6-membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring or an aromatic 8-. 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system<br>
wherein each ring or ring systsm is optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5. The term<br>
"optionally substituted" in connection with these J groups refers to groups which are<br>
unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the<br>
biological activity possessed by the unsubstituted analog. An example of phenyl optionally<br>
substituted with 1 to 4 R5 is the ring illustrated as U-l in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 and r is<br>
an integer from 1 to 4. An example of a naphthyl group optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5<br>
is illustrated as U-85 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5<br>
include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R5 and r is an<br>
integer from 1 to 4. Note that J-l through J-13 below also denote 5- or 6-membered<br>
heteroaromatic rings. Note that U-2 through U-20 are examples of J-l, U-21 through U-35<br>

The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-19. The definitions of A, B, J, K, R], R2, R3, R4, R5 and n in the compounds of Formulae I and 2-41 below are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention.

Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by procedures outlined in Schemes 1-19. A typical procedure is detailed in Scheme 1 and involves coupling of an ortho amino carboxylic acid amide of Formula 2 with an acid chloride of Formula 3 in the presence of an acid scavenger to provide the compound of Formula la. Typical acid scavengers include amine bases such as triethylamine, diisopropyl ethyl amine and pyridine; other scavengers include hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxide and carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In certain instances it is useful to use-polymer-supported acid scavengers such as polymer-bound diisopropylefhylamine and polymer-bound dimethylaminopyridine. In a subsequent step, amides of Formula la can be converted to thioamides of Formula lb using a variety of standard thio transfer reagents including phosphorus pentasulfide and Lawesson"s reagent.<br><br>

Benzoic acids of Formula 4 (J is optionally substituted phenyl) are generally well known in the art as are procedures for their preparation. One particularly useful subset of benzoic acids of this invention are 2-methyl-4-perfluoroalkyl benzoic acids of Formula 4a (R5(a) equals e.g. CF3, C2¥^ C3F7). The synthesis for these compounds is outlined in<br>
10     Schemes 5-9. Benzoic acids of Formula 4a may be prepared from the benzonitriles of Formula 8 by hydrolysis. The conditions used may involve the use of a base such as an alkaline metal hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g. potassium or sodium hydroxide) in a solvent such as water, ethanol or ethylene glycol (e.g. J. Chem. Soc. 1948, 1025). Alternatively, the hydrolysis may be carried out using an acid such as sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid in a<br>
15     suitable solvent such as water (e.g. Org. Synth. 1955, Coll. vol. 3, 557). The choice of the conditions is contingent on the stability of R5 to the reaction conditions and elevated temperatures are usually employed to achieve this transformation.<br>

Anilines of Formula 9 may be prepared from compounds of Formula 10. This transformation may be achieved by a well-known procedure that employs Raney Nickel (Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. VI, 581). Alternatively, the same transformation may be effected by the use of a suitable catalyst such as palladium in the presence of hydrogen. The reaction is usually conducted at pressures of 104 to 107 kPa in a suitable organic solvent such as, but not limited to, toluene. Elevated temperatures of 80-110 °C are usually required to achieve the transformation. As one skilled in the art will realize, numerous chemical modifications of the thioether moiety are possible, and may be employed when necessary to facilitate this transformation..<br>

Synth. Coll. Vol. VI, 581) or sodium methoxide, or in a combination of a protic solvent, a protic solvent and a base. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted is usually in the range 40-110 °C. As one skilled in the art will realize, suitable salts of compounds of Formula 11 such as, but not limited to a hydrochloride, a sulfate or a bisulfate may also be employed, provided that the appropriate amount of base is first used to generate the free base 11. This may be done as a separate step or as an integral part of the step involving the transformation of compounds of Formula 11 to compounds of Formula 10.<br><br>

It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted b any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula I.<br>

an additional 20 minutes and then quenched with water (20 mL). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the reaction mixture partitioned between ether and 0.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous extracts were washed with ether (3x), filtered through Celite® diatomaceous filter aid to remove residual solids,- and then acidified to apH of approximately 4, at which point an orange oil formed. The aqueous mixture was stirred vigorously and additional acid was added to lower the pH to 2.5-3. The orange oil congealed into a granular solid, which was filtered, washed successively with water and IN hydrochloric acid, and dried under vacuum at 50 °C to afford the title product as an off-white solid (130 g).

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compounds of this invention will generally be used as a formulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions-(including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts,<br><br>
WO 02/070483	PCT/TJS02/06582<br>
172<br>
powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible<br>
("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further<br>
formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active<br>
ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release<br>
of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used<br>
at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength<br>
compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent<br>
and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. McCutcheon "s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth and the like, or thickeners to increase viscosity.<br>
Surfactants include, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, dialkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, organosilicones, N,N-dialkyltaurates, lignin sulfonates, naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, polycarboxylates, and polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers. Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, starch, sugar, silica, talc, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,N-alkylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, oils of olive, castor, linseed, rung, sesame, corn, peanut, cotton-seed, soybean, rape-seed and coconut, fatty acid esters, ketones such as<br><br>

cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone: and alcohols such as methanol, cyclohexanol. decanol and tetrahydroforfuryl alcohol.<br>
Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the<br>
ingredients. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and, usually, grinding as in a<br>
5      hammer mill or fluid-energy mill. Suspensions are usually prepared by wet-milling; see, for<br>
example, U.S. 3,060,084. Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active<br>
material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning,<br>
"Agglomeration""", Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp 147^8, Perry"s Chemical<br>
Engineer"s Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, pages 8-57 and following,<br>

25	Compounds of this invention are characterized by favorable metabolic and/or soil<br>
residual patterns and exhibit activity controlling a spectrum of agronomic and non-agronomic invertebrate pests. (In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" means inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significant reduction in feeding or other injury or damage caused by the pest; related<br>
30      expressions are defined analogously.) As referred "to in this disclosure, the term<br>
"invertebrate pesi" includes arthropods, gastropods and nematodes of economic importance as pests. The term "arthropod" includes insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs and symphylans. The term "gastropod" includes snails, slugs and other Stylommatophora. The term "nematode" includes all of the helminths, such as: 35      roundworms, heartworms, and phytophagous nematodes (Nematoda), flukes (Tematoda), Acanthocephala, and tapeworms (Cestoda). Those skilled in the art will recognize that not all compounds are equally effective against all pests. Compounds of this invention display<br><br>

activity against economically important agronomic and nonagronomic pests. The term "agronomic" refers to the production of field crops such as for food and fiber and includes the growth of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye, rice, maize), soybeans, vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, beans), potatoes, sweet potatoes, grapes, cotton, and 5     tree fruits (e.g., pome fruits, stone fruits and citrus fruits). The term "nonagronomic1" refers to other horticultural (e.g., forest, greenhouse, nursery or ornamental plants not grown in a field), public (human) and animal health, domestic and commercial structure, household, and stored product applications or pests. For reason of invertebrate pest control spectrum and economic importance, protection (from damage or injury caused by invertebrate pests) of 10     agronomic crops of cotton, maize, soybeans, rice, vegetable crops, potato, sweet potato, grapes and tree fruit by controlling invertebrate pests are preferred embodiments of the invention.

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or<br>
agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be<br>
particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present<br>
invention can further comprise a biologically effective amount of at least one additional<br>
30     invertebrate pest control compound or agent having a similar spectrum of control but a<br>
different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant<br>
protection compound (e.g., protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective<br>
amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection<br>
and be advantageous for resistance management.<br>
35	Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic applications by<br>
applying one-or more of the compounds of this invention in an effective amount to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present<br><br>
,W0 02/070483<br><br>
PCT/US02/06582<br><br>
182<br>
invention further comprises a method for the control of invertebrates in agronomic and/or nonagronomic applications, comprising contacting the invertebrates or their environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent. Examples of suitable compositions comprising a compound of the invention and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent include granular compositions wherein the additional biologically active compound is present on the same granule as the compound of the invention or on granules separate from those of the compound of this invention.<br>
A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are also effectively delivered through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Compounds are also effective by topical application of a composition comprising a compound of this invention to the locus of infestation. Other methods of contact include application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, gels, seed coatings, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others. The compounds of this invention may also be impregnated into materials for fabricating invertebrate control devices (e.g. insect netting).<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates, particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest"s life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding<br><br>

behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, 5      effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as<br>
0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br>
The following TESTS demonstrates the control efficacy of compounds of this<br>
10     invention on specific pests. "Control efficacy" represents inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significantly reduced feeding. The pest control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A through K and L for compound descriptions.

. BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
.TESTA For evaluating control of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) the test unit consisted of a small open container with a 12-14-day-old radish plant inside. This was pre-infested with 10-15 neonate larvae on a piece of insect diet by use of a core sampler to remove a plug from a sheet of hardened insect diet having many larvae growing on it and transfer the plug containing larvae and diet to the test unit. The larvae moved onto the test plant as the diet plug dried out.<br>
Test compounds were formulated using a solution containing 10% acetone, 90% water and 300 ppm X-77® Spreader Lo-Foam Formula non-ionic surfactant containing alkylarylpolyoxyethylene, free fatty acids, glycols and isopropanol (Loveland Industries, Inc.), unless otherwise indicated. The formulated compounds were applied in 1 mL of liquid through a SUJ2 atomizer nozzle with 1/8 JJ custom body (Spraying Systems Co.) positioned 1.27 cm (0.5 inches) above the top of each test unit. AH experimental compounds in these tests were sprayed at 250 ppm and replicated three times. After spraying of the formulated test compound, each test unit was allowed to dry for 1 hour and then a black, screened cap was placed on top. The test units were held for 6 days in a growth chamber at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity. Plant feeding damage was then visually assessed based on foliage consumed.<br>
Of the compounds tested the following provided very good to excellent levels of plant protection (ratings of 0-1,10% or less feeding damage): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 12, 13,15,<br><br>
