oxygen-containing amme such as an amme oxide or polyoxyethylene alkylamine; an amide-linked amme prepared by the condensation of a carboxylic acid with a di-or polyamine; or a quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
The compositions of the invention can take any form known in the art for the formulation of agrochemicals, for example, a solution a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion, a dusting powder, a seed dressing, a fumigant, a smoke, a dispersible powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or granules.    Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application.<br>
An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent.<br>
A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed and ground with a solid pulverulent diluent, for example, kaolin.<br>
A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those which may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods.  Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient absorbed or adsorbed on a pre-granular diluent, for example. Fuller's earth, attapulgite or limestone grit.<br>
Wettable powders, granules or grains usually comprise the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay.<br>
Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water or other liquid, a wetting agent and a suspending agent.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention, as applied to plants is preferably within the range of 0.0001 to 1.0 per<br>
cent by weight, especially 0.0001 to 0.01 per cent by weight. In a primary composition, the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition.<br>
In the method of the invention the compound is generally applied to seeds, plants or their habitat. Thus, the compound can be applied directly to the soil before, at or after drilling so that the presence of active compound in the soil can control the growth of fungi which may attack seeds.   When the soil is treated directly the active compound can be applied in any manner which allows it to be intimately mixed with the soil such as by spraying, by broadcasting a solid form of granules, or by applying the active ingredient at the same time as drilling by inserting it in the same drill as the seeds.    A suitable application rate is within the range of from 5 to 1000 g per hectare, more preferably from 10 to 500 g per hectare.<br>
Alternatively the active compound can be applied directly to the plant by, for example, spraying or dusting either at the time when the fungus has begun to appear on the plant or before the appearance of fungus as a protective measure. In both such cases the preferred mode of application is by foliar spraying.   It is generally important to obtain good control of fungi in the early stages of plant growth as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged.  The spray or dust can conveniently contain a pre- or post-emergence herbicide if this is thought necessary.   Sometimes, it is practicable to treat the roots of a plant before or during planting, for example, by dipping the roots in a suitable liquid or solid composition.  When the active compound is applied directly to the plant a suitable rate of application is from 0.025 to 5 kg per hectare, preferably from 0.05 to 1 kg per hectare.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention can be applied to plants or parts thereof which have been genetically modified to exhibit a trait such as fungal, insect, and/or herbicidal resistance.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula II, or its hydrochlonde salt, with a compound of formula III according to Scheme 1, where X is a leaving group such as halogen. When L is -(C = 0)- or -SO2-.<br>
preferred reaction conditions comprise mixing II with the corresponding benzoyl or sulfonyl chloride m the presence of triethylamme.<br>
Scheme 1(Scheme Removed)<br>
Compounds of formula I where R2 is optionally substituted alkyl can be prepared by alkylating, in known manner, compounds of formula I where R2 is hydrogen.<br>
Compounds of formula III are known or can be obtained in known manner.<br>
Certain compounds of intermediate formula lla below, are known, i.e. compounds<br>
of general formula II where R2 and R2 are hydrogen. However the art contains no high-yielding, preparative method for compounds of formula lla. We have now developed such a method.<br>
Therefore, according to a third aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula lla comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	reacting under basic conditions, compounds of formula IV, with compounds<br>
of formula V to give intermediates of formula VI, <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
b)	converting intermediates of formula VI to intermediates of formula VII,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
c)	converting intermediates of formula VII to compounds of formula lla.<br>

wherein<br>
Ra and Rb, which may be the same or different, are alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl or phenyl, each of which may be substituted (preferably optionally substituted phenyl) or hydrogen;<br>
E1 is both an electron withdrawing group and a group which may be replaced by hydrogen using methodology known to the skilled chemist in accordance with step c) (preferably a carboxy group or a carboxy ester group);<br>
X1 is a leaving group (preferably halogen); and<br>
A1 and R1 are as defined above for the first aspect of the invention.<br>
Preferred basic conditions for step a) comprise reaction with an alkali metal hydride, alkoxide or carbonate.<br>

When E1 is a carboxy group or carboxy ester group, suitable reaction conditions for decarboxylation (step c)] will be known to the skilled chemist. Preferred decarboxylation conditions comprise heating VII with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
Compounds of formula IV are known or can be prepared in known manner,<br>
Intermediates VI and VII may be isolated- Alternatively they may be generated in situ and the subsequent reaction step performed without isolation or purification. It is preferred that intermediate VI is generated in situ, whereas it is preferred that intermediate VII is isolated.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers, including method steps.<br>
The hydrochloride salt of compounds of formula lib, i.e. compounds of general formula II where R1 is optionally substituted alkyl and R2 is hydrogen, may be<br>
prepared according to reaction Scheme 2. X2 is a leaving group such as bromine and the base is preferably potassium rerf-butoxide. Preferred reaction conditions for conversion to the hydrochloride salt of lIb is treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Many of the compounds of formula lib and their hydrochloride salts are novel. Therefore, according to a fourth aspect the invention provides a compound of formula lib, and salts thereof,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein A1 is as defined above and R1 is optionally substituted alkyl.<br>
The 2-pyridyl group (A1) can have up to four substituents, preferably up to two, which may be the same or different to each other. Preferably, the substituents are on the 3 and/or 5 position of the 2-pyridyl group.<br>

Especially preferred substituents are alkoxy, alkyl, halogen, nitro and trifluoromethyl, particularly chlorine and trifluoromethyl.<br>
Preferably, A1 is a mono- or di-substituted 2-pyridyl group, substituted by chlorine and/or trifluoromethyl.<br>
