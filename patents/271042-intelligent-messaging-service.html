INTELLIGENT MESSAGING SERVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless<br>
communications, and more particularly relates to intelligent messaging<br>
utilizing various filtering and delivery mechanisms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Wireless messaging technology has evolved greatly over the recent<br>
years. Currently, wireless messages can be sent via mobile phones,<br>
computers, watches, and many various wireless communication devices.<br>
Wireless messages can include text, audio, video, and any combination<br>
thereof. One problem with current wireless messaging systems is that a user<br>
is not provided customizable and intelligent delivery mechanisms. For<br>
example, a user is currently limited to sending wireless messages to groups of<br>
users whether or not the users are available to receive the messages. Also, if<br>
a user wants to send invites to a group of individuals, every individual in the<br>
group receives the invite even though one or more individuals are unavailable<br>
to participate. Furthermore, current wireless messaging systems do not<br>
provide a way for users to deliver messages to recipients based on the<br>
recipients' location.<br>
[0003] Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as<br>
discussed above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Briefly, in accordance with the present invention, disclosed are a<br>
method, information processing system, and wireless communication system<br><br>
for providing wireless messaging services to wireless devices. A wireless<br>
messaging request is received from at least one wireless device. The<br>
wireless messaging request is associated with at least one recipient device.<br>
The wireless messaging request is analyzed in response to receiving the<br>
request. The wireless messaging request is determined to include at least<br>
one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria in response to the<br>
analyzing. A wireless message associated with the wireless messaging<br>
request is transmitted to the at least one wireless device based on the at least<br>
one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria.<br>
[0005] In another embodiment, an information processing system for providing<br>
wireless messaging services to wireless devices is disclosed. The information<br>
processing system includes a memory and a processor that is<br>
communicatively coupled to the memory. The information processing system<br>

The wireless messaging request is associated with at least one recipient<br>
device. The wireless messaging request is analyzed in response to receiving<br>
the request. The wireless messaging request is determined to include at least<br>
one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria in response to the<br>
analyzing. A wireless message associated with the wireless messaging<br>
request is transmitted to the at least one wireless device based on the at least<br>
one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria.<br>
[0006] In yet another embodiment, a wireless communication system is<br>
disclosed. The wireless communication system includes a plurality of base<br>
stations and a plurality of wireless devices. Each wireless device is<br>
communicatively coupled to at least one base station in the plurality of base<br>
stations. The wireless communication system also includes at least one<br>
information processing system that is communicatively coupled to at least one<br>
base station in the plurality of base stations. The information processing<br><br>
system also includes a wireless message manager that is communicatively<br>
coupled to the memory and the processor. The wireless message manager is<br>
adapted to receiving a wireless messaging request from at least one wireless<br>
device. The wireless messaging request is associated with at least one<br>
recipient device. The wireless messaging request is analyzed in response to<br>
receiving the request. The wireless messaging request is determined to<br>
include at least one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria in<br>
response to the analyzing. A wireless message associated with the wireless<br>
messaging request is transmitted to the at least one wireless device based on<br>
the at least one of recipient filtering criteria and delivery criteria.<br>
[0007] An advantage of the foregoing embodiments of the present invention is<br>
that a user can perform customizable group communication via messaging<br>
over a wireless network. Another advantage of the present invention is that<br>
recipient filter criteria and delivery criteria can be defined by a user and<br>
associated with wireless messages.<br>

[0018] Wireless Communication System<br>
[0019] According to one embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 1<br>
illustrates an example of a wireless communication system 100. FIG. 1<br>
specifically shows a wireless communication network 102 that can comprise<br>
one or more access networks such as a packet data network (not shown)<br>
and/or a circuit services network (not shown). In one embodiment, the packet<br>
data network is an IP or SIP based connectivity network, which provides data<br>
connections at much higher transfer rates than a traditional circuit services<br>
network. A packet data network can comprise an Evolution Data Only ("EV-<br>
DO") network, a General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS") network, a Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System ("UMTS") network, an 802.11 network,<br>
an 802.16 ("WiMax") network, Ethernet connectivity, dial-up modem<br>
connectivity, or the like. A circuit services network provides, among other<br>
things, voice services to the wireless device. It should be noted that access<br>
networks also include additional components (not shown) such as controllers,<br>
transport/interconnect gear, network management modules, and other<br>
network components that should be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0020] The communications standard of the wireless communication network<br>
102 can comprise Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA"), Time Division<br>
Multiple Access ("TDMA"), Global System for Mobile Communications<br>
("GSM"), General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS"), Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access ("FDMA"), other IEEE 802.16 standards, Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing ("OFDM"), Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access ("OFDMA"), Wireless LAN ("WLAN"), WiMax or the like.<br>
Other applicable communications standards include those used for Public<br>
Safety Communication Networks including Project 25 ("P25") or TErrestrial<br>
TRunked rAdio ("TETRA").<br><br>
[0021] The wireless communication system 100 supports any number of<br>
wireless devices 104 which can be single mode or multi-mode devices. Multi-<br>
mode devices are capable of communicating over multiple access networks<br>
with varying technologies. For example, and not for limitation, a multi-mode<br>
device can communicate over the access networks 106 using various<br>
services such as Push-To-Talk ("PTT"), Push-To-Talk Over Cellular ("PoC"),<br>
multimedia messaging, web browsing, VoIP, and multimedia streaming.<br>
[0022] The wireless communication system 100 also includes one or more<br>
base stations 106 that are communicatively coupled to the wireless<br>
communication network 102 and one or more wireless devices 104. An<br>
information processing system 108 comprising functionality similar to a Short<br>
Messaging Service Center ("SMSC") and/or a Multimedia Messaging Service<br>
Center ("MMSC") is communicatively coupled to the wireless communications<br>
network 102 and a messaging server 110. The information processing<br>
system 108 communicatively couples to the wireless devices 104 and to the<br>
messaging server 110 for utilizing wireless messaging services. The wireless<br>
devices 104, in one embodiment, comprise a wireless messaging client 112<br>
for allowing a user to create and send wireless messages. The wireless<br>
device 104 also includes a delivery manager 114, which includes a wireless<br>
message scheduler 116 and a recipient selector 118. These components<br>
provide customizable and intelligent wireless messaging capabilities to a user<br>
and are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0023] The messaging server 110 comprises a wireless message manager<br>
120. The wireless message manager 120 includes a wireless message<br>
analyzer 122 and a delivery manager 124. The delivery manager 124<br>
includes a wireless message scheduler 126 and a recipient selector 128.<br>
These components also provide customizable and intelligent wireless<br>
messaging capabilities to a user and are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0024] The wireless communication system 100 includes one or more<br>
information processing systems 130,132 communicatively coupled to the<br><br>
wireless communication network 102. For example, one information<br>
processing system 130 is a location server 130 that monitors the location of<br>
wireless devices 104 and comprises location data 134. Another information<br>
processing system 132 is a presence server 132 that monitors the availability<br>
of a wireless device 104 and comprises presence data 136. For example, a<br>
user can set a status at the wireless device such as available, busy, away,<br>
and other status. Also, presence can be determined based on the location of<br>
the wireless device and/or the current time. It should be noted that the<br>
location server 130 and the presence server 132 can be located at the same<br>
information processing system. Also, the messaging server 110 can<br>
alternatively comprise location and presence modules. The location and<br>
presence servers 130,132 are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0025] Customizable and Intelligent Wireless Messaging<br>
[0026] This section discusses one example of the customizable and intelligent<br>
wireless messaging system according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A user creates one or more wireless messages, such as through<br>
the messaging client 112 at the wireless device 104, or through another<br>
wireless message entry device. One advantage of the present invention is<br>
that a user can also select various filters and delivery criteria for a wireless<br>
message. For example, FIG. 2 shows an example of a wireless message<br>
200. A user has selected a specific group, "Friends", as the intended<br>
recipients of the wireless message 200. The group "Friends" comprises two<br>
or more wireless device addresses/numbers that are associated with<br>
individuals designated by the user in his/her "Friends" group. It should be<br>
noted that a user can also create a message to be sent to a single recipient or<br>
add multiple address/numbers or groups in the "To:" field 202.<br>
[0027] The wireless message 200 includes a "Message" section 204 which<br>
comprises the actual message, invitation, event, or the like that is to be sent<br>
to the recipient(s). For example, FIG. 2 shows a message of "Do you want to<br>
meet me in Millennium Park for lunch at 12:15 today?" This message can<br><br>
also be setup as a calendar invite or an event listing that when accepted by a<br>
recipient would update the appropriate application such as a calendar or a<br>
"To-Do" list. FIG. 2 also shows a "Filter field 206 and a "Delivery" field 208.<br>
It should be noted that these fields are not limited to residing in the message<br>
form (e.g., the form used to create the message). For example, the filter and<br>
delivery options can reside in other menus within the messaging client 112.<br>
[0028] The "Filter" field 206 allows a user to define filtering criteria for the<br>
recipients of the message 200. For example, a user can set the filter criteria<br>
to "any", which indicates to the messaging server 110 that the message is to<br>
be sent to all of the recipients listed in the message. The user can also<br>
indicate in the filter criteria that the message is to be sent to recipients that are<br>
"available" or "free". In this example, when the messaging server 110<br>
receives the message 200, the recipient selector 128 determines which of the<br>
recipients are "available" and selects those recipients to send the message to.<br>
The messaging server 110 can determine the status of a recipient by querying<br>
the presence server 132 and receiving presence data 136.<br>
[0029] A user can also select multiple status criteria such as "available" and<br>
"busy". In addition to presence criteria, a user can define location criteria in<br>
the filter field 206. For example, a user may want the message sent only to<br>
members in the "Friends" group that are within a certain distance from a<br>
location (e.g., Millennium Park in this example). The recipient selector 128 at<br>
the messaging server 110, in one embodiment, queries the location server<br>
130 to determine which recipients are within a given distance to the specified<br>
location. The recipient selector 128 then selects recipients destined to<br>
receive the message 200 based on the indicated location criteria and any<br>
presence criteria defined by the sender. It should be noted that the filtering<br>
can be performed at the wireless device 104 as compared to the messaging<br>
server 110. In this example, the recipient selector 118 of the wireless device<br>
104 selects recipients (as discussed above) out of the set of recipients<br>
defined by the sender. Therefore, when the message 200 is sent to the<br><br>
messaging server 110 the filtering of recipients has already been performed<br>
by the wireless device 104 itself.<br>
[0030] FIG. 2 also shows a "Delivery" field 208 that allows a user to define<br>
delivery criteria for the message. The delivery criteria indicates to the<br>
messaging server 110 when to deliver the message 200 to a recipient. For<br>
example, and not for limitation, a user can define delivery criteria based on<br>
presence status of a recipient, on location status of a recipient, and on other<br>
criteria. The messaging server 110 analyzes the delivery criteria and the<br>
delivery manager 124 delivers the message 200 to the selected recipients<br>
based on the delivery criteria (and filter criteria if defined). As discussed<br>
above, the selected recipient or recipients are selected from the original<br>
recipient or recipients associated with the message 200 by the user based on<br>
the filter criteria.<br>
[0031] One example of a presence status is "available". In this example, a<br>
user can define a delivery criterion that indicates the message 200 is to be<br>
delivered to any recipient(s) that has a presence status of "available".<br>
Therefore, the delivery manager 124 at the messaging server 110 delivers the<br>
message 200 to recipients selected based on the filter criteria when the<br>
presence status of the selected recipients is "available".<br>
[0032] Additionally, the user can define location criteria that indicate to the<br>
messaging server 110 when to deliver the message 200 based on the location<br>
of a recipient. For example, a user can define a location delivery criterion that<br>
indicates that a message 200 is to be sent to a recipient when that recipient is<br>
near his/her home. In this example, the messaging server 110 analyzes the<br>
message and determines that location delivery criteria exist. The delivery<br>
manager 124 queues the message 200 to be sent when location information<br>
134 indicates that the particular recipient is near his/her home. It should be<br>
noted that filtering based on delivery criteria can be performed at the wireless<br>
device 104 instead of the messaging server 110. For example, the wireless<br>
device 104 can query the presence and location servers 130,132 to<br><br>
determine the status and location of selected recipients. When the presence<br>
and delivery criteria (if any are present) match, the wireless device 104 can<br>
transmit the message 200 to message server 110. The messaging server<br>
110 then transmits the message 200 to the recipient(s).<br>
[0033] As can be seen from the above examples, a user can customize<br>
message recipient groups based on various recipient filtering and message<br>
delivery criteria. A user can also select a single recipient, or one or more<br>
groups of recipients, to receive a message. The wireless device 104 and/or<br>
the messaging server 110 can select one or more recipients from the original<br>
set of recipients based on recipient filter criteria. Delivery of a message can<br>
also be customized by defining delivery criteria such as presence status of a<br>
recipient and location of the recipient.<br>
[0034] In another embodiment, periodic or event-based notifications are<br>
provided to a wireless device 104 from the messaging server 110. For<br>
example, a user can be notified by the messaging server 110 when a recipient<br>
has received a message 200. If a message 200 is delayed until a filter or<br>
delivery criterion is met by a recipient, the messaging server 110 can also<br>
notify the wireless device 104 when the message 200 is sent. Also, as<br>
discussed above, the original set of recipients selected by a user may not be<br>
the final set of recipients. Therefore, the user can be notified of which original<br>
recipients have been sent the message 200. A user can also send a cancel<br>
notification to the messaging sever 110 to cancel a sent message. If the<br>
message 200 is still pending at the messaging server 110, (e.g., the message<br>
200 is to be sent when the recipient is near his/her home) the message 200 is<br>
cancelled and not sent. However, if a message 200 has already been sent<br>
and received by a recipient, the messaging server 110 can send a cancel<br>
notification to the recipient. This notification informs the recipient that the<br>
sender is canceling/recalling the received message 200.<br>
[0035] Example of Wireless Device<br><br>
[0036] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a detailed view of the wireless<br>
device 104 according to an embodiment of the present invention. It is<br>
assumed that the reader is familiar with wireless communication devices. To<br>
simplify the present description, only that portion of a wireless communication<br>
device that is relevant to the present invention is discussed. The wireless<br>
device 104 operates under the control of a device controller/processor 302,<br>
that controls sending and receiving wireless communication signals. In<br>
receive mode, the device controller 302 electrically couples an antenna 304<br>
through a transmit/receive switch 306 to a receiver 308. The receiver 308<br>
decodes the received signals and provides those decoded signals to the<br>
device controller 302.<br>
[0037] In transmit mode, the device controller 302 electrically couples the<br>
antenna 304, through the transmit/receive switch 306, to a transmitter 310. It<br>
should be noted that in one embodiment, the receiver 308 and the transmitter<br>
310 are a dual mode receiver and a dual mode transmitter for<br>
receiving/transmitting over various access networks providing different air<br>
interface types. In another embodiment, a separate receiver and transmitter<br>
is used for each type of air interface.<br>
[0038] The device controller 302 operates the transmitter and receiver<br>
according to instructions stored in the memory 312. The memory 312, in one<br>
embodiment, includes the messaging client 112, delivery manager 114,<br>
wireless message scheduler 116, and recipient selector 118. The wireless<br>
device 104, also includes non-volatile storage memory 314 for storing, for<br>
example, an application waiting to be executed (not shown) on the wireless<br>
device 104.<br>
[0039] Example of Information Processing System<br>
[0040] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a more detailed view of the<br>
messaging server 110. The messaging sever 110 is based upon a suitably<br>
configured processing system adapted to implement the embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention. For example, a personal computer, workstation, or the like,<br>
may be used. The messaging sever 110 includes a computer 402. The<br>
computer 402 has a processor 404 that is connected to a main memory 406,<br>
a mass storage interface 408, a man-machine interface 410, and network<br>
adapter hardware 412. A system bus 414 interconnects these system<br>
components.<br>
[0041] The main memory 406 includes the wireless message manager 120,<br>
which includes the wireless message analyzer 122, delivery manager 124,<br>
wireless message scheduler 126, and recipient selector 128. Although<br>
illustrated as concurrently resident in the main memory 406, it is clear that<br>
respective components of the main memory 406 are not required to be<br>
completely resident in the main memory 406 at all times or even at the same<br>

[0043] Overall Process Of One Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
[0044] FIG. 5 is an operational flow diagram illustrating an overall process of<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. The operational flow diagram of<br>
FIG. 5 begins at step 502 and flows directly to step 504. The messaging<br>
server 110, at step 504, receives a wireless messaging request from a<br>
wireless device. The wireless messaging request is associated with a<br>
wireless message that is to be sent to one or more recipient devices. The<br><br>
messaging server 110, at step 506, analyzes the messaging request. The<br>
messaging server 110, at step 508, determines if the wireless messaging<br>
request is associated with recipient filter criteria and/or delivery criteria. If the<br>
result of this determination is negative, the messaging server 110, at step<br>
510, transmits the wireless message to the recipient device(s). The control<br>
flow then exits at step 512. If the result of this determination is positive, the<br>
messaging server 110, at step 514, transmits the wireless message to one or<br>
more recipients based on the recipient filtering and delivery criteria. The<br>
control flow exits at step 516.<br>
[0045] Intelligent Delivery Of Wireless Messages<br>
[0046] FIG. 6 is an operational flow diagram illustrating a process of<br>
intelligently delivering wireless messages to recipients. The operational flow<br>
diagram of FIG. 6 begins at step 602 and flows directly to step 604. The<br>
messaging server 110, at step 604, receives an update from the presence<br>
server 132 associated with a particular wireless device. The messaging<br>
server 110, at step 606, retrieves pending wireless messaging requests<br>
associated with the particular wireless device. The messaging server 110, at<br>
step 608, determines if presence criteria (if any) are met by the wireless<br>
device. If the result of this determination is negative, the messaging server<br>
110 continues to monitor the presence information for the wireless device.<br>
[0047] If the result of this determination is positive, the messaging server 110,<br>
at step 610, updates a messaging database to indicate that the presence<br>
criteria for a particular message have been met. The wireless messaging<br>
server 110, at step 612, receives an update from the location server 130<br>
associated with a particular wireless device. The messaging server 110, at<br>
step 614, retrieves pending wireless messaging requests associated with the<br>
particular wireless device. The messaging server 110, at step 616,<br>
determines if location criteria (if any) are met by the wireless device. If the<br>
result of this determination is negative, the messaging server 110 continues to<br>
monitor the location information for the wireless device.<br><br>
[0048] If the result of this determination is positive, the messaging server 110,<br>
at step 618, updates a messaging database to indicate that the location<br>
criteria for a particular message has been met. The messaging server 110, at<br>
step 620, determines if both presence (if any) and location (if any) criteria are<br>
met. If the result of this determination is negative, the messaging server 110,<br>
at step 622, waits to send the message until the presence and location criteria<br>
are met. If the result of this determination is positive, the messaging server<br>
110, at step 624, sends the message to the one or more recipients and sends<br>
a delivery notification to the sending device 104. The control flow exits at step<br>
626.<br>
