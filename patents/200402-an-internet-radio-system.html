				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an Internet Radio system of communication especially applicable to popular use of Internet. Today the conventional Internet is based on point-to-point transmission communication protocol called the TCP/IP, i.e. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol The TCP/IP can be defamed as a set of computer-to-computer communications protocols initially developed for the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Define. This is the foundation of the Internet. Many institutions, corporations, universities and government agencies use TCP/IP. The set of TCP/IP protocols consist of media access, packet transport, session communications, file transfer, e-mail and terminal emulation.<br>
It is known that Internet is a network of networks, and it is the world's largest distributed system which has a huge collection of hypertext as known as the worldwide web. Hypertext links connect information in separate html pages situated at different web servers and one can explore these pages using a "Web Browser**.<br>
On a study of the usage patterns for browsing the Internet, it has been found that users require mostly downstream communication with a very sum<br><br>
upstream communication. This invention makes its possible to browse the Internet using one-way channel only. In fact theoretician given infinite bandwidth and memory, can replace all n on-transaction oriented two-way internet communication by one-way broadcast Internet. In practice a substantially useful browsing system can be constructed using as label memory and bandwidths.<br>
United States Portent No. 6,314,094 describes a Mobile wireless internet portable radio. This is a similar invention but it addresses the internet from indigo reception point of view. It misses the concept of the present invention which could be used for remote publishing of web pages including browsing of e-mails. The aforesaid U.S. patent does not include caching of data.<br>
The theorem, which will be called Sheehan’s Theorem, for the present invention is " A two-way communication system (like the internet) can be replaced by a one-way communication system (like a Radio broadcast), provided there is a receiving device with inmate memory and inmate bandwidth." The present invention describes a practical implementation of the above theorem.<br><br>
The communication system of the present invention has been developed using Age above theory and the principles of 'Paging Systems'. The communication system will be hereinafter referred to as the Internet Radio System and will primarily consist of the fooling:<br>
1.	A content generation system, which determines and organizes frequently used information mad schedules it for transmission on a broadcast media. Each web page is remotely published in a subscriber's receiving device.<br>
2.	An 'Internet Radio Receiver** which is tike a pager with a very large memory (as limited by affordability), and an information storage structure. The key component is a user programmable information filter that allows the user to define the information requirement that will be stored in the user's device. This feature is absent m all the conventional pagers making this device a tunable Internet Radio. It will have a display device that is convenient to view/listen the information stored in the device. This makes the device as a E-Mail and Web viewing device.<br>
3.	A digital radio transmitter to transmit the content which has both<br>
directory/version conation information and content bundled together, so that<br>
tie inform  ion can update the contents of the receiving device without<br>
needing to re-send the entire information.<br><br>
For abettor understanding of the invention, the various expressions used in the specification has been explained as given below:<br>
INTERNET PROTOCOL: The Internet Protocol is a method or  rococo by which data/information is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Bach computer (known as a host) on the Internet has at least one address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the Internet. When data is send or received (for example, an e-mail note or a web   the message gets divided into little chunks called 'PACKETS'. Each of these packets contains batik the sender's Internet address and the receiver's address. Any packet is sent fast to a  gateway' computer that understands a small part of the internet, i.e. it reads the destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent gateway that in turn reads the destination address and 80 forth across the Internet until one gateway recognizes the packet as belong to a computer within its immediate neighborhood or 'domain'. That gateway then forwards the packet directly to the computer whose address is specified. In short, the Internet Protocol just delivers the 'packets* to the destmatiott and its up to another protocol, the Transmission Control<br><br>
Protocol (TCP) to put them back in right order.     IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that tiered is no established connection between the<br>
•      . •<br>
end points that are commentating.<br>
CONTENT: This is an abundant amount of well-presented subject information organized for interesting and useful access in a hypertext structure.<br>
CONTENT GENERATION: Crewing or adding file information on the internet<br>
CONTENT DELIVERY: On the Internet, content delivery (sometimes called content distribution, content distribution delivery, or content caching) is the service of coping the pages of a Web site to geographically dispersed servers and, when a page is requested, dynamically identifying and serving page content from the closest server to Age user, enabling faster delivery Content delivery can also be used for specific high-traffic events such as live Web broadcasts by continually dispersing content from the originating server to other servers via satellite links.<br>
PORT: In programming, a port (noun) is a 'logical connection place'* and specifically, using the Internet's Protocol, TCP/IP, the way a client program<br><br>
specifies a particular server program on a computer in a network. Higher-level applications that use TCP/IP such as the Web protocol. HTTP, have ports with pre-assigned numbers. These are known as '^well-known ports" that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. Other application processes are given port numbers dynamically for each connection. When a service (server program) initially is started, it is said to bad to its designated port number. As any client program wants to use  at server, it also must request to bind to the designated port number.<br>
BROWSING: This is an act of accessing and interacting with all the information on the World Wide Web/the Internet through an application program known as 'Browser*. The known browsers are Netscape Navigator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Lynx, Opera, etc.<br>
FILTER: In computer programming, a filter is a program or section of code that is designed to examine each input or output request for certain qualifying criteria and then process or forward it accordingly. A filter is 'pass-through' code that takes input data, makes some specific decision about it and possible transformation of it, and passes it on to another program in a kind of<br><br>
Pipeline. Usually, a filter does no input/output operation on its own. Filters are someone’s used to remove or insert headers or control characters in data.<br>
DATA: In computing, day is information* that has been translated into a form that is more convenient to move or process. Relative to today's computers and transmission media, data is information converted into binary or digital form.<br>
The proposed system with a simplex one way broadcast communication channel can be used to augment Lie Internet and is a proposed architecture for significffiitly reducing the load on the conventional Internet and replace the use of Internet for retrieval of static and dynamic information. Only the transactional and rarely used information needs &amp;e conventional Internet with two-way communication.<br>
In a further embodiment,  crew is provided an Internet Radio System having<br>
typically of 128 simultaneous information channels, comprising of:<br>
a. Internet radio protocol having typically a .12 bit unique addressing system<br>
wherein the file structure of the receiving instrument being the same as<br>

addresses being mapped to domain names in the receiving instrument;<br><br>
b.	A port open control packet for starting the transmission, the said packets<br>
being sent through an error correcting scheme;<br>
c.	a close port control packet for closing the&amp; transmission; both the packets<br>
have the following structure, i.e., (t) a packet type header, (2) a 32 bit<br>
address fled, (3) packet type details and parameter fields, (4) idle type, file<br>
name and data field, (5) port numbers with the data being transmitted and<br>
(6) error correcting code.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>

•	Users have the facility to select the information of their choice from a uniform Menu Page. This method is used to set information filters   i.e., to select exactly those information p^es (for instance Web Sites) that the user desires to store. Thus any of the broadcast information is neglected if the filter does not explicitly give instruction to store the incoming information. This is equivalent to tuning a radio or a TV of the analog world. The method enables a very large number of channels not possible overlies and is exploited to effectively browse Use Internet/Information pages.<br><br>
