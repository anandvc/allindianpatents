PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY<br>
A - Inhibition of the glucane synthesis of Candida albicans.<br>
The membranes of Candida albicans are purified according to the process described by Tang and al Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 35, 99-103, 1991. 22.5pg of membrane proteins are incubated in a mixture of 2Mm of 14C-UDP glucose (specific activity = 0.34mCi./mmol, 50ug of a-amylase, 1Mm of dithiotreitol (DTT), 1Mm EDTA, 100Mm NaF, 7mM of GTP-y-S, 1M of sucrose and 5oMm OF Ttris-HCL (pH 7.8) in a volume of 100ml The medium is incubated at 25°C for 1 hour and the reaction terminated by addition of TCA to a final concentration of 5%. The reaction medium is transferred onto a pre-humidified glass fibre filter. The filter is washed, dried and its radioactivity is counted.<br>
Mulundocandin is used as positive control.<br>
The control of the medium is carried out with the same quantity of DMSO 1 %. The obtained results show that the products of the invention present a good activity in this test, particularly the products of examples 9,11, and 14. <br>
B - activity on the enzyme Aspergillus fumigatus.<br>
The enzyme is prepared according to the Beaulieu et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chenother 38, 937-944, 1994) process.<br>
The protocol used is identical to the protocol described above for the enzyme Candida albicans except that dithiotreitol is not used in the reaction medium.<br>
The products present a good activity in this test.<br><br>
