				<td>A METHOD FOR PREVENTING UNDESIRABLE ACTIVITIES<br>
OF EXECUTABLE OBJECTS VIA AN APPLICATION<br>
AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preventing undesirable activities of<br>
Executable Objects via an application and apparatus therefor, and generally to<br>
the security management of computer networks. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to methods and systems for preventing undesirable activities of<br>
Executable Objects is a workstation of a computer network.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The Internet has developed very much both in respect of its contents and<br>
of the technology employed, since it began a few years ago. In the early<br>
days of the Internet, web sites included text only, and after a while<br>
graphics was introduced. As the Internet developed, many compressed<br>
standards, such as pictures, voice and video files, were developed and with<br>
them programs used to play them (called "players"). Initially, such files<br>
were downloaded to the user's workstation only upon his request, and<br>
extracted only by the appropriate player, and after a specific order from<br>
the user.<br>
When, in the natural course of the development of the World Wide Web<br>
the search for a way to show nicer, interactive and animated Web Pages<br>
began, Sun-Microsystems Inc. developed Java - a language that allows the<br>
webmaster to write a program, a list of commands - Network Executables<br>
- that will be downloaded to the user workstation without his knowledge,<br>
and executed by his browser at his workstation. The executables are used,<br>
e.g., to provide photographic animation and other graphics on the screen of<br>
the web surfer. Such executables have some ways approaching the user<br>
workstation's resources, which lead to a great security problem. Although<br>
some levels of security were defined in the Java language, it was very soon<br>
that a huge security hole was found in the language.<br>
Since Java was developed, Microsoft developed ActiveX, which is another<br>
Network Executable format, also downloaded into the workstation.<br>
ActiveX has also security problems of the same kind.<br>
The Internet has been flooded with "Network Executables" that may be<br>
downloaded -- deliberately or without the knowledge of the users -- into<br>
workstations within organizations. These codes generally contain<br>
harmless functions. Although usually safe, they may not meet the<br>
required security policy of the organization.<br>
Once executed, codes may jam the network, cause considerable<br>
irreversible damage to the local database, workstations and servers, or<br>
result in unauthorized retrieval of information from the<br>
servers/workstations. Such elements may appear on Java applets, ActiveX<br>
components, DLLs and other object codes, and their use is increasing at an<br>
unparalleled pace. The majority of these small programs are downloaded<br>
into the organization unsolicited and uncontrolled. The enterprise has no<br>
way of knowing about their existence or execution and there is no system<br>
in place for early detection and prevention of the codes from being<br>
executed.<br>
The security problem was solved partially by the browser manufacturers<br>
which allow the user to disable the use of executables. Of course this is not<br>
a reasonable solution, since all the electronic commerce and advertising<br>
are based on the use of executables. The security problem is much more<br>
serious once such an executable can approach the enterprise servers,<br>
databases and other workstations.<br>
Dean D. et al (Java Security: From HotJava to Netscape and Beyond,<br>
Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, US, Los<br>
Alamitos, IEEE Comp. Soc. Press, vol. SYMP. 17, 1996, pp. 190-200)<br>
addresses the security problems of Java-based systems and concludes that<br>
the Java system cannot easily be made secure.<br>
In a copending patent application of the same applicant herein, IL 120420,<br>
filed on March 10, 1997 (and on February 23, 1998 as PCT/IL98/00083),<br>
the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference, a method is<br>
described and claimed, for selectively preventing the downloading and<br>
execution of undesired Executable Objects in a computer, which comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
(a) providing one or more Control Centers, each connected to one or<br>
more gateways, each gateway serving one or more end user computers;<br>
(b) providing means coupled to each of said gateways, to detect<br>
Executable Objects reaching said gateway, to analyze the header of each<br>
of said Executable Objects, and to determine the resources of the computer<br>
that the Executable Object needs to utilize;<br>
(c) providing means coupled to each of said gateways, to store each<br>
end user computer Security Policy representing the resources, or<br>
combination of resources, that the administrator allows or does not allow<br>
an Executable Object to utilize within its destination, wherein the<br>
Security Policy is received from and/or stored in each of said one or more<br>
Control Centers;<br>
(d) when an Executable Object is detected at the gateway:<br>
1. analyzing the header of said Executable Object;<br>
2. determining the resources of the computer that the<br>
Executable Object needs to utilize;<br>
3. comparing the resources of the computer that the<br>
Executable Object needs to utilize with the Security Policy<br>
and;<br>
(i) if the resources of the computer that the Executable<br>
Object needs to utilize are included in the list of the<br>
resources allowed for use by the Security Policy,<br>
allowing the Executable Object to pass through the<br>
gateway and to reach the computer which has<br>
initiated its downloading; and<br>
(ii) if the resources of the computer that the<br>
Executable Object needs to utilize are included in<br>
the list of the resources prohibited for use by the<br>
Security Policy, preventing the Executable Object<br>
from passing through the gateway, thereby<br>
preventing it from reaching the computer which has<br>
initiated its downloading.<br>
A Control Center (CC) may be a central control unit, e.g., a PC or other<br>
computer, which is connected to a plurality of gateways, and which<br>
updates the memory means containing relevant date, e.g., the Security<br>
Policy. Once the CC is updated, e.g., by the addition of an additional<br>
limitation to the Security Policy, all gateways are updated at once. The<br>
use of the CC to control the operation of the security elements of the<br>
gateways obviates the need (which exists in prior art systems) to update<br>
each gateway every time that a change in policy is made.<br>
A LAN (Local Area Network) may be (but is not limited to), e.g., a network<br>
of computers located in an office or building. The LAN is typically<br>
connected to outside communications networks, such as the World Wide<br>
Web, or to more limited LANs, e.g., of a client or supplier, through one or<br>
more gateways. The larger the organization, the larger the number of<br>
gateways employed, in order to keep communications at a reasonable<br>
speed.<br>
Generally speaking, a LAN can also be made of a plurality of smaller<br>
LANs, located geographically nearby or far apart, but even if small LANs<br>
are found within the same organization, the security requirements may<br>
vary from one department to the other, and it may be necessary to keep<br>
high security levels, including preventing Executables from migrating<br>
from one department to the other, even within the same organization.<br>
The means coupled to each of said gateways, to detect Executable Objects<br>
reaching said gateway, to analyze the header of each of said Executable<br>
Objects, and to determine the resources of the computer that the<br>
Executable Object needs to utilize may be of many different types.<br>
Typically, the executable object is "trapped" and analyzed at the gateway<br>
by listening on the communication line to the TCP/IP protocol, as well as<br>
to the object transfer protocols, such as SMTP, HTTP, FTP, etc. Hooking<br>
into the communication line and extracting the contents of the header of<br>
the executable object are steps which are understood by the skilled person,<br>
and which can be effected by means of conventional programming, and<br>
they are therefore not described herein in detail, for the sake of brevity.<br>
Once the header of the Executable Object (EO) has been analyzed,<br>
comparing the resources of the computer that the EO needs to utilize with<br>
the Security Policy can be easily done, e.g., by comparing them with a<br>
look-up table provided to the gateway by the CC, which represents the<br>
Security Policy. Comparison can also be carried out against the data<br>
stored in the CC, and in such a case specific memory means and<br>
comparing means may not be necessary in the gateway. However, speed<br>
and performance considerations will often dictate that such operations be<br>
carried out at the gateway itself.<br>
Prior art solutions provide for the analysis of communication taking place<br>
via a single port, Port 80, which is the port commonly employed for web<br>
surfing. However, today it is possible to surf the net through ports other<br>
than Port 80, while the HTTP server of the user, according to currently<br>
available technology, cannot work on a plurality of ports. Therefore, if<br>
more than one user employ a gateway simultaneously, prior art systems<br>
are ineffective since they are not suitable for the simultaneous analysis of<br>
communication taking place via other ports.<br>
Another severe drawback is that a very strong HTTP server is needed to<br>
serve a plurality of users, when operating according to the prior art<br>
method.<br>
In order to permit to analyze the executables "on the fly", without<br>
hindering the downloading and he operation of harmless executables,<br>
another copending patent application of the same applicants herein<br>
(121815, filed September 22, 1997, and corresponding PCT application<br>
PCT/IL98/00082, filed on February 23, 1998) provides a method for<br>
processing Executable Objects, comprising:<br>
(a) providing analysis means capable of non-interfering analysis of<br>
data packets transmitted on a communication line between a<br>
browser and an HTTP server on the web, said communication<br>
line being established through a gateway;<br>
(b) analyzing the handshake between said browser and said server,<br>
to detect a "GET_* command sent by the user and an HTTP code<br>
sent in response by said server;<br>
(c) when such an HTTP code is detected, analyzing the data<br>
packets transmitted by said server to said browser, by:<br>
(1) providing ordering means to order data packets received<br>
in non-sequential order, and to forward them in sequential<br>
order to header checking means;<br>
(2) checking the data packets so as to analyze the contents of<br>
the header of the Executable Object, and to identify the<br>
resources of the system that it needs to employ;<br>
(3) transmitting to said gateway data representing the<br>
resources of the system that the Executable Object needs<br>
to utilize; and<br>
(4) providing data packet suppressing means coupled to said<br>
gateway, such that if the resources of the system that the<br>
Executable Object needs to utilize are not permitted<br>
according to the security policy set by the administrator, at<br>
least one data packet belonging to the 4Executable Object<br>
is suppressed, altered or damaged, so as to prevent the<br>
execution thereof by the browser.<br>
The ever changing scene of Internet systems, however, requires that new<br>
solutions be provided to new threats which develop continuously, to add to<br>
the security provided by existing methods. Specifically, new Internet<br>
browsers are equipped with expanded capabilities, in addition to those<br>
needed for browsing the Internet, such as the ability to access local files<br>
and directories. Furthermore, other applications, such as, for instance,<br>
MS-Word or Visual-C++, allow browsing to be carried out directly without<br>
the need for an additional browser. In this situation, the separation that<br>
existed conventionally between Internet applications and other programs,<br>
does no longer exist. As a result, undesirable Executable Objects may be<br>
allowed access through "secure" applications, viz., through applications,<br>
such as a word processor, that were previously considered safe inasmuch<br>
as they did not allow for the access of EOs.<br>
The art has so far failed to provide a solution to this problem, and it is<br>
clear that such a solution is urgently needed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTTON<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for preventing<br>
undesirable activities of Executable Objects, that overcomes the aforesaid<br>
drawbacks of prior art systems.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide such a method which is easy<br>
to implement and which does not require hardware changes.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method which prevents<br>
an application that has been exposed to the Internet to access selected<br>
resources.<br>
Other advantages and objects of the invention will become apparent as the<br>
description proceeds.<br>
The method for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, according to the invention, comprises denying to the same<br>
application, or one or more of its threads, access to a secured resource if it<br>
has previously exhibited Internet behavior and has not met a specific<br>
condition for accessing said resource, and denying said application, or one<br>
or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the time access is sought, it<br>
is accessinga secured resource.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the method<br>
comprises recording in a memory events representative of Internet<br>
behavior, keeping a record of all resources that are to be kept secured and<br>
when an application that has previously exhibited Internet behavior<br>
attempts to access one such secured resource, denying access to said<br>
secured resource, unless:<br>
- At least a predetermined period of time has passed since the last<br>
Internet behavior; or<br>
- It has performed at least a predetermined number of operations<br>
after exhibiting Internet behavior; or<br>
- Another preset condition has been fulfilled.<br>
The preset conditions that can be employed for this purpose are many, and<br>
suitable conditions for a specific system will be easily recognized by the<br>
skilled person and may comprise, for instance, the exercise of control over<br>
the execution of downloadable received during Internet behavior, to<br>
ensure that no unexecuted downloadable may access the secured resource.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, for instance, the<br>
preset condition comprises the analysis of the downloadables to ascertain<br>
that they are harmless.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention Internet behavior is<br>
blocked by disabling the network connection creation or specific protocols,<br>
such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc., or by disallowing the transfer of objects<br>
(EOs) through a protocol. However, if so desired, the access to trusted sites<br>
need not be disabled.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention access to a<br>
secured resource is blocked by disabling a thread using a specific system<br>
service that is used to access the secured resource.<br>
The invention also encompasses apparatus for preventing undesirable<br>
activities of Executable Objects via an application, comprising a memory<br>
for storing a record of Internet behavior of a plurality of applications, and<br>
means for denying to the same application access to a secured resource if<br>
it has previously exhibited Internet behavior and has not met a specific<br>
condition for accessing said resource, and further for denying said<br>
application, or one or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the time<br>
access is sought, it is accessing a secured resource.<br>
The invention is further directed to a system for preventing undesirable<br>
activities of Executable Objects via an application, comprising a computer<br>
on which one or more applications are to run, said computer being<br>
connectable to the Internet, or intranet or extranet, said computer being<br>
provided with a memory for storing a record of Internet behavior of each of<br>
said plurality of applications, and means for denying to the same<br>
application access to a secured resource if it has previously exhibited<br>
Internet behavior and has not met a specific condition for accessing said<br>
resource, and further for denying said application, or one or more of its<br>
threads, Internet behavior if, at the time Internet behavior is exhibited, it<br>
is accessing a secured resource.<br>
Throughout this specification, whenever reference is made to the Internet,<br>
it is understood that the same applies, mutatis mutandis, to any other<br>
type of network, e.g., an Intranet or Extranet, and the skilled person will<br>
easily understand that all that is said with reference to the Internet is<br>
equally applicable, with due modifications, to other types of networks.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for preventing undesirable<br>
activities of Executable Objects via an application, characterized by denying to<br>
the same application, or one or more of its threads, access to a secured<br>
resource if it has previously exhibited Internet behavior and has not met a<br>
specific condition for accessing said resource, and denying said application, or<br>
one or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the time access is sought, it is<br>
accessing a secured resource.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for preventing undesirable<br>
activities of Executable Objects via an application, comprising a memory for<br>
storing a record of Internet behavior of a plurality of applications, and means for<br>
denying to the same application access to a secured resource if it has previously<br>
exhibited Internet behavior and has not met a specific condition for accessing<br>
said resource.<br>
The present invention further provides a system for preventing undesirable<br>
activities of Executable Objects via an application, comprising a computer on<br>
which one or more applications are to run, said computer being connectable to<br>
the Internet or Intranet or Extranet, said computer being provided with a memory<br>
for storing a record of Internet behavior of each of said plurality of applications,<br>
and means for denying to the same application access to a secured resource if it<br>
has previously exhibited Internet behavior and has not met a specific condition<br>
for accessing said resource.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Figs. 1A and 1B schematically illustrates two alternative situations<br>
in which an application that has been exposed to the Internet is denied<br>
access to secured resources;<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows a situation in which an application that<br>
is currently accessing a secured resource is denied Internet behavior; and<br>
Fig. 3 further illustrates the secure resources blocking process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Looking now at Fig. 1A, a situation is illustrated in which an Application<br>
(indicated as "Application #1") tries to reach through one of its threads (in<br>
the figure, Thread #1) a secured resource, SR. The Thread #1 (or any other<br>
thread of the same application) has previously exhibited Internet behavior<br>
(Internet behavior meaning that an application opens a connection to the<br>
Internet). This behavior has been recorded in memory means (not shown<br>
in the figure), along with the details of the event. In the option detailed in<br>
Fig. 1A, any other thread of the same application is prevented from<br>
accessing the SR.<br>
In the alternative situation depicted in Fig. 1B, only the specific thread<br>
that has exhibited Internet behavior, and any sub-thread thereof, are<br>
prevented from accessing the SR, while all other threads are allowed<br>
access. In the specific example of Fig. 1B, none of Thread #1, and its<br>
sub-threads (Thread #2 and Thread #3) can access a secured resource.<br>
According to the invention, whenever an application exhibits Internet<br>
behavior, this event is recorded in a memory (which can be located in the<br>
workstation or in the server). A record is also kept in a look-up table, of all<br>
resources that are to be kept secured. When the same application that has<br>
previously exhibited Internet behavior attempts to access one such<br>
secured resource, access to the resource is denied, unless:<br>
1) At least a predetermined period of time has passed since the last<br>
Internet behavior; or<br>
2) It has performed at least a preset number of operations after the<br>
Internet behavior; or<br>
3) Another preset condition has been fulfilled.<br>
Many pre-set conditions can be used to allow access to an otherwise barred<br>
secured resource. For instance, control may be exercised over the<br>
execution of downloadables received during such connection, to ensure<br>
that no unexecuted downloadable may access the secured resource, or the<br>
downloadables may be thoroughly analyzed to ascertain that they are<br>
harmless. For instance, many browsers provide their own sand-box for<br>
Java applets, or executable objects are certified harmless with a digital<br>
signature, or executable objects are analyzed online or statically. The<br>
skilled person will, of course, be able to provide many different suitable<br>
conditions for this purpose.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 2, a different situation is shown, in which one thread<br>
of an application (Application #1) has already accessed a secured resource,<br>
SR, and is now exhibiting Internet behavior. In this situation, Internet<br>
behavior will be denied. Here, again, a look-up table is kept of secured<br>
resources, so that, whenever an application attempts to exhibit Internet<br>
behavior, the memory in which a log of the resources accessed is kept is<br>
checked against the look-up table. If one of the resources currently being<br>
accessed is a secured resource, then Internet behavior is denied.<br>
When an application receives an Internet executable (e.g., a Java or<br>
ActiveX object) it normally stores it in a temporary or cache directory and<br>
only when the entire executable has been downloaded from the Internet,<br>
one of the threads within the application accesses it and executes it. These<br>
steps are schematically shown in Fig. 3: Step 1 (S1) - A thread downloads<br>
an Internet Executable; Step 2 (S2) - A thread reads the Internet<br>
Executable from the temporary or cache directory; Step 3 (S3) - A thread<br>
attempts to access a secured resource and is denied access. Either thread<br>
can perform any or more than one step. Step 3 will be performed even if<br>
one of steps S1 or S3 has not been performed.<br>
Of course, the above operations can be carried out within the workstation<br>
in a variety of ways, using many different programs and computer<br>
routines, which are within the skill of the routineer, and which therefore<br>
are not described herein in detail, for the sake of brevity. An example of<br>
the operations involved in handling the data and blocking access to<br>
resources is described, for instance, in the copending PCT patent<br>
application No. PCT/IL98/00084 filed on February 23, 1998 (based on<br>
Israeli Patent Application No. 122314, filed November 27, 1997) of the<br>
same applicant hereof, the description of which if wholly incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
All the above description of preferred embodiments has been provided for<br>
the sake of illustration, and is not intended to limit the invention in any<br>
way, except as defined by the claims. Many modifications may be effected<br>
in the invention. For instance, a variety of applications can be involved in<br>
the securing process, and their activities can be memorized and analyzed<br>
in many different ways, all without exceeding the scope of the invention.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A method for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, characterized by denying to the same application, or one or more<br>
of its threads, access to a secured resource if it has previously exhibited Internet<br>
behavior and has not met a specific condition for accessing said resource, and<br>
denying said application, or one or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the<br>
time access is sought, it is accessing a secured resource.<br>
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising recording in a memory events<br>
representative of Internet behavior, keeping a record of all resources that are to<br>
be kept secured and when an application that has previously exhibited Internet<br>
behavior attempts to access one such secured resource, denying access to said<br>
secured resource, unless :<br>
(a) At least a predetermined period of time has passed since the last<br>
Internet behavior; or<br>
(b) It has performed at least a predetermined number of operations<br>
after exhibiting Internet behavior; or<br>
(c) Another preset condition has been fulfilled.<br>
3. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the preset condition comprises<br>
the exercise of control over the execution of downloadables received during<br>
Internet behavior, to ensure that no unexecuted downloadable may access the<br>
secured resource.<br>
4. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the preset condition comprises<br>
the analysis of the downloadables to ascertain that there are harmless.<br>
5. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein Internet<br>
behavior is blocked by disabling the network connection creation.<br>
6. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein Internet<br>
behavior is blocked by disabling specific protocols.<br>
7. A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the specific protocols comprise<br>

trusted sites is not disabled.<br>
10. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein access to a<br>
secured resource is blocked by disabling a thread using a specific system<br>
service that is used to access the secured resource.<br>
11. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein all sub-threads<br>
of a thread that is denied access to a secured resource are also denied access<br>
to secured resources.<br>
12. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein all sub-threads<br>
of a thread that is denied Internet behavior are also denied Internet behavior.<br>
13. Apparatus for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, comprising a memory for storing a record of Internet behavior of a<br>
plurality of applications, and means for denying to the same application access<br>
to a secured resource if it has previously exhibited Internet behavior and has not<br>
met a specific condition for accessing said resource.<br>
14. Apparatus for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, comprising a memory for storing a record of Internet behavior of a<br>
plurality of applications, and means for denying said application, or one or more<br>
of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the time access is sought, it is accessing a<br>
secured resource.<br>
15. A system for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, comprising a computer on which one or more applications are to<br>
run, said computer being connectable to the Internet or Intranet or Extranet, said<br>
computer being provided with a memory for storing a record of Internet behavior<br>
of each of said plurality of applications, and means for denying to the same<br>
application access to a secured resource if it has previously exhibited Internet<br>
behavior and has not met a specific condition for accessing said resource.<br>
16. A system for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, comprising a computer on which one or more applications are to<br>
run, said computer being connectable to the Internet or Intranet or Extranet, said<br>
computer being provided with a memory for storing a record of Internet behavior<br>
of each of said plurality of applications, and means for denying said application,<br>
or one or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the time Internet behavior is<br>
exhibited, it is accessing a secured resource.<br>
A method for preventing undesirable activities of Executable Objects via<br>
an application, comprising denying to the same application, or one or more of its<br>
threads, access to a secured resource (SR) if it has previously exhibited Internet<br>
behavior and has not met a specific condition for accessing the resource, and<br>
denying the application, or one or more of its threads, Internet behavior if, at the<br>
time access is sought, it is accessing a secured resource. Events which are<br>
representative of Internet behavior are recorded in a memory. A record is kept,<br>
so that all the resources that should kept secured and when an application that<br>
has previously exhibited Internet behavior attempts to access one such secured<br>
resource, access to the secured resource is denied, unless at least a<br>
predetermined period of time has passed since the last Internet behavior, or it<br>
has performed at least a predetermined number of operations after exhibiting<br>
Internet behavior; or another preset condition has been fulfilled.</td>
