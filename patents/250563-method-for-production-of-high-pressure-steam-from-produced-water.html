				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001 ]	This process relates generally to a method and to a water evaporation<br>
system for the treatment of produced waters and high quality steam generation for<br>
operations that utilize high-pressure steam to recover oil from geological<br>
formations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Oil producers utilize different means to produce steam for injection<br>
into the oil bearing formation. The steam that is injected into the geologic<br>
formation condenses by direct contact heat exchange, thus heating the oil and<br>
reducing its viscosity. The condensed steam and oil are collected in the producing<br>
well and pumped to the surface. This oil/water mixture, once the oil has been<br>
separated from it, is what is referred to as 'produced water' in the oil industry.<br>
[0003]	Since water can comprise up to 90% of every barrel of oil/water<br>
mixture removed from the formation, the recovery and reuse of the water is<br>
necessary to control the cost of the operation and to minimize the environmental<br>
impact of consuming raw fresh water and subsequently generating wastewater for<br>
disposal. Once the decision to recover water is made, then treatment of those<br>
produced waters is required to reduce the scaling and/or organic fouling tendency<br>
of the water. This treatment generally requires the removal of the hardness and<br>
other ions present in the stream, preferably to near zero. As is understood in the<br>
art, the 'hardness' causing ions are the combined calcium and magnesium salts in<br>
the water to be used in steam generation equipment and is typically expressed as<br>
parts per million (ppm) although other terms can be used. While silica is not<br>
considered as adding to the hardness value, its presence can also lead to scaling<br>
problems if present in other than minimal amounts.<br>
[0004]	The traditional method for generation of steam in enhanced oil<br>
recovery is to utilize a once-through steam generator (OTSG) in which steam is<br><br>
generated from a treated feedwater through.tubes heated by gas or oil burners. The<br>
OTSG feedwater can have a total dissolved solids concentration as high as 12,000<br>
ppm (as CaCO3 equivalent), but requires a hardness level that is near zero. This<br>
method produces a low quality or wet steam, which is 80% vapor and 20% liquid,<br>
at pressures ranging from 600 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) up to 2000 psig.<br>
This 80% quality steam is separated from the 20% water and then injected into the<br>
formation. Either a portion or all of the 20% blowdown is disposed as a<br>
wastewater. Another method that has been proposed to obtain the high quality<br>
steam requirement is using a water tube boiler instead of the OTSG to generate<br>
steam. The water tube boiler, however, requires an even greater amount of<br>
feedwater pretreatment than the OTSG to ensure problem free operation. For a<br>
comparison of the feedwater requirements for both OTSG and water tube boilers,<br>
refer to Figures 6 and 7. There are numerous ways to obtain the feedwater quality<br>
required for steam generation, several of which are outlined below for illustration.<br>
[0005]	The oil/water mixture coming out of the production well is sent to the<br>
primary oil-water separator where substantially all of the oil is separated from the<br>
produced water. This separator can be comprised of any known apparatus, but<br>
typically, it is comprised of one or more free-water-knock-outs (FWKO), which<br>
allow separation of the oil and Water by gravity. The separated oil is further treated<br>
to remove the last of the water and then sent to storage.<br>
[0006]	The separated produced water is sent to a cone bottom tank where<br>
heavy solids, such as sand, are allowed to settle out and any remaining oil rises to<br>
the top for removal. If any substantial oil remains after this step, one or more<br>
induced gas flotation units are utilized to remove substantially all of the oil present<br>
in the produced water. Alternately, a de-oiling polymer can be used with a<br>
resultant waste oil/solids sludge, which needs further handling for disposal.<br>
[0007]	The de-oiled produced water stream is then further treated for reuse.<br>
Its constituents are variable but typically it is relatively high in total dissolved<br>
solids (TDS), total organic carbon (TOC), hardness, and silica. The water<br><br><br>
treatment plant schemes which have heretofore been utilized downstream, of the de-<br>
oiling zone and upstream of the steam injection well, as well as the equipment<br>
which is necessary or desirable to obtain high quality steam at 600 psig, or greater,<br>
is the focus of the improvements explained and described in this disclosure.<br>
[0008]	Referring to Figure 1, which outlines a typical prior art process used<br>
to obtain high quality steam for down hole injection, the raw produced water 6 is<br>
sent to a de-oiling process zone 8 and then to a warm lime softener 310. Chemicals<br>
312 such as Ca(OH)2, Na2CO3, MgO, NaOH, and a coagulant are introduced into<br>
the lime softener depending on the reaction desired and a precipitate consisting of<br>
hardness and silica is generated. Following the lime softener, a media type filter<br>
324 is utilized to remove the small suspended solids that were not caught up in the<br>
lime sludge. The partially softened produced water, still saturated in calcium (as<br>
CaCO3), is then further de-ionized in a weak acid cation (WAC) exchanger 18<br>
which essentially removes all remaining divalent ions. The softened produced<br>
water is then sent to the once through steam generator 230, via a conduit that passes<br>
through pre-heaters (4 and 76), and 80% quality steam 236 is generated. A steam<br>
separator 240 removes the 20% water entrainment and produces high quality steam<br>
100 for down-hole injection in the steam flooding process. The high temperature<br>
blowdown 96 from the steam separator is then sent to a series of flash tanks to<br>
provide progressively lower steam pressures for other uses. If zero liquid discharge<br>
is desired, then the flash steam 134 can be used in a steam driven multiple effect<br>
evaporator and crystallizer 140 to obtain a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) system.<br>
[0009]	This prior art method is known technology and is considered to be the<br>
industry standard. However, it carries with it several disadvantages. These are:<br>
[0010]	1. It has the highest chemical cost of any options<br>
[0011]	2. It has the highest cost for sludge and salt cake disposal<br>
requirements<br>
[0012]	3. The OTSG's are limited by the 80% conversion of water into<br>
steam<br><br><br>
[0013]	4. The OTSG has inherent design problems in terms of tube<br>
wetting, fouling, and scaling<br>
[0014]	5. In cold weather operations, the sludge from the lime softener<br>
becomes very hard to handle<br>
[0015]	6. In the event of an unscheduled maintenance shutdown, the<br>
sludge in the lime softener can quickly set up in a form similar to concrete<br>
and become very hard to remove from the system.<br>
[0016]	Figure 2 depicts another current prior art process in which the lime<br>
soda softening, media filter, and polishing WAC are replaced by a mechanical<br>
vapor compressor evaporator (MVC) 244. The de-oiled produced water 14 may be<br>
treated with an acid such as hydrochloric (HC1) to lower the pH and destroy any<br>
non-hydroxide alkalinity present. Any non-condensable gasses (NCG) 58 present<br>
may be removed in deaerator 56. Caustic such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 62<br>
may then be added to raise the pH to around 10 or higher. The MVC evaporator<br>
244 produces a low TDS distillate stream 246 that is used to feed the OTSG 230<br>
and the process of generating high pressure steam for down-hole injection is<br>
accomplished in the same manner as in Figure 1. In this case, the blowdown 96<br>
from the steam separator 240 is flashed to a steam driven crystallizer 252 which<br>
concentrates the brine blowdown 248 from the MVC evaporator 244 and thus<br>
provides a ZLD system. The low TDS vapor produced in crystallizer 162 is routed<br>
through conduit 166, where it is combined with the liquid portion 138 exiting the<br>
flash tank 130, and then to the OTSG feed storage tank 36.<br>
[0017]	While this process seems to provide a simple approach to providing '<br>
high quality water to the OTSG, it has limited applicability in that the concentration<br>
of the hardness causing ions, such as calcium and magnesium, must be quite low in<br>
the raw produced water. If the hardness ions are not low, then the MVC is limited<br>
in the concentration factor obtainable, scale control chemicals are required, or it has<br>
to operate in the seeded-slurry mode to avoid calcium sulfate and silica scaling. In<br>
the seeded-slurry mode, calcium chloride (CaCl2) and/or sodium sulfate (Na2SO4)<br><br><br>
has to be added to the feed stream to ensure that a circulating magma of calcium<br>
sulfate (CaSO4) crystals, typically 3-10% suspended solids (SS), is maintained in<br>
the MVC evaporator 244. This circulating magma is used as precipitation sites for<br>
the incoming calcium ions and for the co-precipitation of silica. This seeded-slurry<br>
mode of operation is aptly taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,618,429.<br>
[0018]	The disadvantages to this system are:<br>
[0019]	1. Power consumption is high due to MVC evaporator<br>
compressor<br>
[0020]	2. A very large electrical infrastructure is required to supply<br>
power to the MVC evaporator compressors<br>
[0021]	3. Suppliers of OTSG equipment are reluctant to design to<br>
greater than 80% quality steam even with high quality feed water<br>
[0022]	4. OTSG tube wetting problems<br>
[0023]	5. Applicability is limited to low calcium and low magnesium<br>
produced waters due to high pH requirements for silica solubility and even<br>
when low, acid cleanings are required to maintain evaporator efficiency by<br>
removing the CaCO3 scale that builds up.<br>
[0024]	6. The evaporator is subject to scaling from low solubility<br>
constituents in the evaporator feed like strontium, barium and complexes of<br>
metals that occur at high pH operation.<br>
[0025]	Figure 3 is yet another prior art process that utilizes a MVC<br>
evaporator 244 to pre-treat the de-oiled produced water in the same manner as that<br>
shown in Figure 2. In this case though, the high quality distillate 246 from the<br>
MVC 244 is cooled in heat exchanger 280 and sent via conduit 284 to a reverse<br>
osmosis unit (RO) 290 that removes the volatile TOC from it. The R.0 permeate<br>
294 is then suitable for use by a high efficiency water tube boiler 110 that will<br>
produce high quality steam. The need for a steam separator system and blowdown<br>
condensate system is eliminated. Likewise, the inherent problems of an OTSG are<br>
thus eliminated and a greater conversion of water to steam is obtained. The<br><br><br>
blowdown from the boiler is directed to the MVC (262). The steam driven ZLD<br>
system of the preceding figures has to be eliminated in favor of a MVC driven<br>
system as the amount of blowdown from the water tube boiler is insufficient to<br>
support a steam driven evaporator. Due to compressor limitations, an MVC<br>
crystallizer 268 is also required for final concentration. On some produced waters,<br>
notably those with minimal non-volatile TOC, the RO system 290 is not required<br>
and the MVC distillate 246 is directed to the watertube boiler 110 without any<br>
further treatment. However, this variation has the potential of fouling and scaling<br>
the watertube boiler to a greater extent than when distillate post treatment is<br>
utilized.<br>
[0026]	The advantages of this system are the incorporation of the water tube<br>
boiler and a lower operating cost, due to lower fuel consumption, as compared to<br>
the MVC/OTSG Figure 2 process.<br>
[0027]	The disadvantages of this system include:<br>
[0028]	1. Highest power consumption and highest electrical<br>
infrastructure requirements<br>
[0029]	2. High total cost compared to other options<br>
[0030]	3. Multiple types of MVC evaporators are required<br>
(pretreatment/blowdown and crystallizer) which complicates operation<br>
[0031]	4. TOC is all rejected to the pretreatment/blowdown and<br>
crystallizer MVCs which will likely cause foaming problems that will<br>
complicate operation and puts the MVC compressors at risk of damage<br>
[0032]	5. Pretreatment MVC evaporator distillate must be cooled prior<br>
to RO treatment and then reheated.<br>
[0033]	In summary, the prior art process designs in current use for treating<br>
heavy oilfield produced waters for high quality steam generation to be utilized in<br>
down-hole steam flooding applications is not entirely satisfactory due to:<br>
[0034]	1. physical chemical treatment processes are usually extensive,<br>
require high maintenance and operator interface, and generate large sludge<br><br><br>
and regeneration streams that need to be dealt with in accordance with strict<br>
environmental regulations,<br>
[0035]	2. large quantities required of expensive treatment chemicals<br>
that, in cases, need special safety/handling procedures,<br>
[0036]	3. reliance on low efficiency OTSGs to generate high quality<br>
steam at a recovery rate of 80%, water to steam and the associated steam<br>
separator and blowdown condensate handling systems,<br>
[0037]	4. inherent OTSG problems with insufficient tube wetting, high<br>
heat transfer rates, and tube plugging,<br>
[0038]	5. high power consumption requirements and electrical<br>
infrastructure due to the use of vapor compressors,<br>
[0039]	6. treating the entire produced water stream to meet requirements<br>
for ASME grade water that can be utilized in a commercial water tube<br>
boiler.<br>
[0040]	As water is becoming increasingly expensive to treat, or in short<br>
supply, or both, it would be desirable to simplify the treatment necessary to<br>
generate high quality, high pressure steam and reduce the costs. Finally, it would<br>
be clearly desirable to meet such increasingly difficult water treatment objectives<br>
with better system availability and longer run times than is commonly achieved<br>
today.<br>
[0041]	It is believed that no one heretofore has thought it feasible to operate<br>
a water tube boiler on deionized water coupled to an evaporator system at high pH<br>
and at pressures high enough to provide steam that can be directly used for steam<br>
flooding projects. The conventional engineering approach has been to design<br>
systems such as those depicted in the prior art Figures 1-3 or to limit the final<br>
concentrations to levels that do not cause scaling problems.<br>
[0042]	Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the heavy oil<br>
industry to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies. Accordingly,<br>
it would be advantageous to address the drawbacks to current practice, which<br><br><br>
would help both the environment and assist the production facility ownership and<br>
operations area in controlling costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0043]	The present invention provides a novel high pressure steam<br>
generation method for produced water employing industrial high TDS brine<br>
concentration technology that eliminates the need for once through steam<br>
generators and power consuming vapor compressors.<br>
[0044]	In a unique process for producing high pressure steam vapor, de-oiled<br>
produced waters of low hardness and low non-hydroxide alkalinity are injected<br>
with a caustic solution to raise the pH prior to high pressure steam generation<br>
(HiPVap). In situations wherein scale causing non-hydroxide alkalinity is present<br>
in the produced water feed stream, an acid injection system is used to destroy the<br>
alkalinity prior to raising the pH for steam generation in the HiPVap.<br>
[0045]	The preferred design used in the present invention provides a<br>
produced water steam generation plant that overcomes a number of important and<br>
serious problems. First, the use of problem prone low efficiency once through<br>
steam generators for high pressure steam production is no longer required. Second,<br>
the pretreatment requirements of the produced water, prior to high pressure steam<br>
generation, are minimized or eliminated entirely. Sludge streams associated with<br>
warm lime softening are eliminated. Third, the process as disclosed herein, is<br>
completely steam driven and there is no requirement for high energy consuming<br>
mechanical vapor compressors or electrical infrastructure. Fourth, controlled levels<br>
of multivalent cations, combined with controlled levels of non-hydroxide alkalinity,<br>
substantially eliminates the precipitation of scale forming compounds associated<br>
with sulfate, carbonate, or silicate anions. Thus, cleaning requirements are<br>
minimized. This is important commercially because it enables a water treatment<br>
plant to avoid lost water production, which would otherwise undesirably require<br>
increased treatment plant size to accommodate for the lost production during<br><br><br>
cleaning cycles. Fifth, the preferred high pH operational conditions enable a high<br>
degree of ionization to be achieved in various species which are sparingly ionized<br>
at neutral or near neutral pH in aqueous solution, such as silica, to enable such<br>
species to be concentrated to higher levels before precipitation. Sixth, another<br>
benefit to HiPVap operation is the use of industry accepted water tube boilers, the<br>
feed to which is not organic laden makeup water. Finally, the HiPVap steam<br>
generation process has the benefits of a very high brine recirculation rate to<br>
evaporation rate ratio, which results in better heat transfer surface wetting, and a<br>
lower temperature difference combined with a lower heat transfer rate across the<br>
heat transfer surface than an OTSG operating on the same produced water. The<br>
result is a better design with less scaling potential and higher allowable<br>
concentration factors.<br>
[0046]	OBJECTS, ADVANTAGES, AND NOVEL FEATURES<br>
[0047]	A new process for producing high-pressure high quality steam from<br>
produced water disclosed herein, and various embodiments thereof, can be applied<br>
to the heavy oil industry. Such embodiments are particularly advantageous in that<br>
they consume less electrical power, minimize the generation of waste products,<br>
utilize waste heat, minimize maintenance, and are superior to current water<br>
treatment processes heretofore used in the recovery of oil from tar sands and other<br>
heavy oil operations.<br>
[0048]	From the abovementioned, it will be observed that one of the<br>
significant and major objectives resides in the provision of a novel process,<br>
including variations thereof, for the treatment of produced waters, so that such<br>
waters can be recovered and re-used in producing steam for use in heavy oil<br>
recovery operations.<br>
[0049]	Another important objective is to simplify process plant flow sheets<br>
by minimizing the number of unit processes required in water treatment trains,<br>
which simplifies operations and lowers costs in heavy oil recovery operations.<br><br><br>
[0050]	Other important, but more specific objectives reside in the provision<br>
of various embodiments of an improved water treatment process for production of<br>
high quality steam for down-hole use in heavy oil recovery, which:<br>
[0051]	(a) eliminates the requirement for once through steam generators<br>
and separation of high pressure steam from residual hot condensates;<br>
[0052]	(b) eliminates the generation of softener sludges;<br>
[0053]	(c) reduces electrical power consumption by utilizing steam as the<br>
energy source instead of mechanical vapor compressors;<br>
[0054]	(d) minimizes operation and maintenance labor requirements;<br>
[0055]	(e) reduces the capital and operating costs of water treatment<br>
equipment; and<br>
[0056]	(f) minimizes chemical additives and associated handling<br>
requirements.<br>
[0057]	Other important objects, features, and additional advantages of the<br>
invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art ftom the foregoing and<br>
from the appended claims, in conjunction with the detailed discussion below and<br>
the accompanying drawing.<br><br>
[0058]	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0059]	In the drawings:<br>
[0060]	For comparative purposes, all of the prior art examples shown herein<br>
incorporate the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) concept as a part of the illustration<br>
although, in many current installations, waste disposal is accomplished by deep-<br>
well injection. Those skilled in the art will recognize that merely minimizing the<br>
blowdown stream without the use of a dewatering device may, on certain<br>
occasions, also qualify the system as ZLD. The high pressure, high efficiency<br>
evaporation method defined herein is site specific wherein individual process steps<br>
are customized to fit the specific feed water, and needs of the customer. For that<br>
reason, all possible embodiments of this novel method of water treatment are not<br><br><br>
illustrated and, as those skilled in the art can appreciate, other illustrative<br>
embodiments would merely reflect variations and rearrangement of some<br>
components without affecting the spirit or concept of this invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0072]	Heavy oil recovery operations have increasingly incorporated the<br>
steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) method to recover oil from tar sand and<br>
other networks. In this method the injected steam is more efficiently utilized as<br>
100% quality (i.e., no liquid water entrained with the steam) in contrast to older<br>
methods in which an 80% steam/20% water mixture was used for steam flooding of<br>
the oil field. However, the once through steam generators (OTSG) in standard use<br>
are designed to generate 80% quality steam which then requires the use of steam<br>
separators to remove the entrained water portion to provide 100% quality steam for<br>
down-hole injection. The use of an OTSG to supply the 100% quality steam<br>
required for steam flooding leaves the high pressure high temperature liquid portion<br>
that needs to be handled and disposed of. In some cases it can be utilized for other<br>
steam consumers by using a sequential arrangement of flash tanks, each providing a<br><br>
lower pressure steam, but ultimately resulting in a liquid stream that had to be<br>
disposed of.<br>
[0073]	Heavy oil recovery operators are now looking at commercial water<br>
tube boilers to generate the 100% steam quality required. This became the desired<br>
next step since water tube boilers are designed to provide high purity steam at the<br>
pressures required for steam flooding, whereas the installation, operating, and<br>
maintenance expenses are lower than OTSGs, and the high efficiency of the water<br>
tube boiler results in a small blowdown stream that requires disposal. However, the<br>
use of a water tube boiler required a more extensive water pretreatment process as<br>
the feedwater requirements are much stricter than for an OTSG. Refer to FIG. 6<br>
and FIG.7 for a comparison of the feedwater characteristics required for the water<br>
tube boiler installation in comparison to the OTSG. The industry recognizes that<br>
the only way to achieve the water quality required for water tube boilers is to<br>
remove the dissolved solutes and TOC (Total Organic Carbon) present in produced<br>
waters. This level of pre-treatment requires membrane separation and/or<br>
evaporative process. Cooling and subsequent reheating of the produced water are<br>
required for membrane systems due to their temperature limitations. Also, the<br>
evaporation processes that have been considered (reference Figures 2 and 3) are<br>
energy intensive.<br>
[0074]	The invention disclosed herein provides a novel integrated process<br>
for generating high pressure steam from produced water. The energy that would<br>
normally only be used once to generate injection steam is used twice in this<br>
process. The first use of the energy is the generation of steam from high purity<br>
water in a water tube boiler. The second use is the generation of injection steam<br>
from produced water. The generation of injection steam from produced water is<br>
accomplished by utilizing a high pressure, high efficiency HiPVap process. This<br>
overcomes the disadvantages of the low efficiency OTSG, the requirements for<br>
treating the full produced water feed stream to ASME quality standards for water<br>
tube boilers, and high power consumption by the MVC installations. When<br>
-<br><br>
incorporated with the zero liquid discharge (ZLD) in one embodiment, recoveries<br>
greater than 98% of the produced water feed stream are attainable at a cost effective<br>
price with no liquid streams requiring disposal.<br>
[0075]	Present day state of the art steam generation, either OTSG or<br>
watertube boiler, is limited on how much water can be recovered by scale causing<br>
ions, such as hardness and silica, which are inherent in these waste streams, total<br>
organic carbon (TOC), and maximum total dissolved solids (TDS) allowable in the<br>
feed stream. The additions of expensive scale inhibiting agents or scale control<br>
methods are beneficial but still have their limits of usefulness. Evaporators that are<br>
used as industrial brine concentrators overcome the TDS limitations with their built<br>
in high solids capability and heat transfer surface wetting design. They can also<br>
handle high TOC loadings but volatile TOC carries over with the generated vapor<br>
which, when condensed, passes into any downstream users of the distillate<br>
produced causing scaling and/or fouling problems.<br>
[0076]	The present invention provides a novel process to overcome these<br>
limitations and recover more of the produced water for steam generation than was<br>
previously possible by providing a high pH scale free environment in a high<br>
pressure, high efficiency HiPVap process that incorporates the high solutes<br>
capability of industrial brine concentrators. Volatile TOC does not present a<br>
problem as it is carried out with the high pressure steam vapor and sent to the<br>
borehole for steam injection. In addition, the HiPVap process does not require any<br>
additional energy to produce high pressure injection steam, as compared to<br>
conventional OTSG systems, and uses significantly less energy than the current<br>
MVC evaporative technologies.<br>
[0077]	Although it may seem impractical to use steam to generate steam, the<br>
practice has positive benefits when applied as disclosed herein. Of prime<br>
importance is the fact that both the industrial high pressure evaporator and the<br>
watertube boiler are being operated in the environments that they were originally<br>
designed for; i.e. a high TDS brine concentrating evaporator coupled with a high<br><br><br>
pressure high purity ASME grade watertube boiler. This leads to equipment<br>
reliability and reduced costs. The cost reductions can be broken down into lower<br>
operating costs, since there is no requirement for mechanical vapor compressors,<br>
and lower water pretreatment capital costs, since there is not a requirement for<br>
extensive water conditioning associated with changing a produced water into<br>
ASME quality water.<br>
[0078]	Attributes that characterize the high pressure, high efficiency<br>
evaporator (HiPVap) process design and operation are:<br>
[0079]	Generation of high quality steam at pressures ranging from 200 to<br>
1600 psig without the use of a low efficiency once through steam generator<br>
(OTSG).<br>
[0080]	The ratio of evaporation to recirculation of produced water inside the<br>
HiPVap unit is very low, thus the heat transfer surface stays very well wetted and<br>
scaling potential along with dry spots is minimized.<br>
[0081]	Lower power consumption and lower electrical infrastructure costs as<br>
electrically driven steam vapor compressors are not required.<br>
[0082]	Time proven conservative industrial design for the evaporation of<br>
high TDS streams wim high organic levels.<br>
[0083]	Elimination of lime softening waste streams which are difficult to<br>
handle in cold climates.<br>
[0084]	Simplified pretreatment process for de-oiled produced water prior to<br>
steam generation.<br>
[0085]	Very high solubility of weak acid anions such as silica when<br>
operating at a high pH.<br>
[0086]	Very high achievable concentration factors (recovery-ninety percent<br>
(90%) or higher recovery can be achieved).<br>
[0087]	Cleaning frequency is substantially reduced.<br>
[0088]	Addition of scale inhibitors is virtually eliminated.<br><br><br>
[0089]	Corrosion potential is reduced by operation at high pH thus allowing<br>
the use of low cost materials of construction.<br>
[0090]	Reduced overall operating cost, compared to conventional produced<br>
water recovery and steam generation systems.<br>
[0091]	Reduced overall capital cost, compared to conventional produced<br>
water recovery and steam generation systems.<br>
[0092]	The HiPVap process is site-specific. Individual process steps are<br>
customized to fit the particular produced water at a given site. Regardless of the<br>
difference in the pretreatment process for different sites, one process parameter is<br>
common for all applications, namely that the HiPVap system is operated at the<br>
highest feasible blowdown pH. This factor enables the circulating solution to<br>
provide a low corrosion potential, high silica tolerant, and non-fouling organic<br>
environment at the heat transfer surface.<br>
[0093]	With reference to the various figures, produced water feed stream 14<br>
will typically contain soluble and insoluble, organic and inorganic components.<br>
The inorganic components can be salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate,<br>
calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, barium chloride, barium<br>
sulfate, and other like compounds. Metals such as copper, nickel, lead, zinc,<br>
arsenic, iron, cobalt, cadmium, strontium, magnesium, boron, chromium, and the<br>
like may also be included. Organic components are typically dissolved and<br>
emulsified hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, phenol, and the like.<br>
[0094]	Produced waters utilized for production of steam additionally include<br>
me presence of silicon dioxide (also known as silica or SiC^) in one form or<br>
another, depending upon pH and the other species present in the water. For<br>
evaporator systems, scaling of the heat transfer surfece with silica is to be avoided.<br>
This is because (a) silica forms a relatively hard scale that reduces productivity of<br>
the evaporator, (b) it is usually rather difficult to remove, (c) the scale removal<br>
process produces undesirable quantities of spent cleaning chemicals, and (d)<br>
cleaning cycles result in undesirable and unproductive off-line periods for the<br><br><br>
equipment. Therefore, regardless of the level of silica in the incoming raw feed<br>
water, operation of conventional evaporation processes, without a scale control<br>
method such as preferential deposition seeded slurry, generally involves<br>
concentration of SiO2 in the high solids stream to a level not appreciably in excess<br>
of 150 ppm of silica (as SiO2). This requires that evaporator systems be operated at<br>
lowered concentration factors (recovery rates) to prevent silica concentration in the<br>
blowdown stream from exceeding solubility limits. Seeded slurry systems can be<br>
taken to concentration factors that surpass the solubility of silica but rely on seed<br>
management procedures and are still prone to scaling of the evaporator heat transfer<br>
surfaces.<br>
[0095]	It is commonly understood that the solubility of silica increases with<br>
increasing pH, and that silica is quite soluble in high pH aqueous solution. The<br>
increase in silica solubility is basically proportional to the change in ionization as<br>
increased ionization results in the soluble silicate ion being the dominant species.<br>
The solubility is not directly proportional because even un-dissociated silica<br>
exhibits some solubility in aqueous solutions, typically up to about one hundred<br>
twenty (120) ppm to one hundred sixty (160) ppm, depending upon temperature<br>
and other factors. In comparison, it has been demonstrated that silica solubility at<br>
pH 11 is in excess of one thousand five hundred (1,500) ppm at ambient<br>
temperature; silica is increasingly soluble as temperature and/or pH increases.<br>
[0096]	Silica is very weakly ionized when in neutral or near neutral aqueous<br>
solutions and is generally considered to exist as un-dissociated (meta/ortho-) silicic<br>
acid (H4 SiO4) in most naturally occurring waters with a pH of up to about 8. The<br>
dissociation constant (pKa) value for the first stage of dissociation of silica has<br>
been reported at approximately 9.7, which indicates that silica is approximately<br>
fifty percent (50%) ionized at a pH of 9.7; the other fifty percent (50%) remains as<br>
un-dissociated (ortho) silicic acid at that pH. A graphical representation of the<br>
relationship between pH and the percent silica ionization is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Clearly, it would be advantageous, where silica ionization is desired, to operate at a<br><br><br>
pH in excess of 10, and more preferably, in excess of 11, and yet more preferably,<br>
in excess of 12 where the entire silica molecule is present as a soluble silicate ion.<br>
[0097]	Therefore, increasing the pH of the HiPVap process thus provides the<br>
major benefit of increased silica solubility. To gain maximum benefit from silica<br>
ionization at high pH, the HiPVap system should be operated at a pH as high as<br>
possible. Preferably, the evaporator system is operated at a pH of about 10.5 or<br>
above, and more preferably, at a pH of 11 or higher.<br>
[0098]	By maintaining hardness and non-hydroxide alkalinity at levels which<br>
effectively avoid formation of scale at a selected pH for HiPVap process, the<br>
concentration of SiO2 in the HiPVap blowdown stream can be safely increased to at<br>
least 5500 ppm, or more. This is accomplished by raising the pH of the produced<br>
water fed to the HiPVap system and without the use of silica scale inhibition<br>
chemicals or control methods.<br>
[0099]	The novel process disclosed herein is situated between the oil<br>
separation zone, 8 in the various figures, and the steam injection well used for<br>
steam flooding in oil recovery installations. The separated and de-oiled produced<br>
water 14, typically with 10 to 20 ppm residual oil, is analyzed for calcium<br>
carbonate scale forming potential by use of scale indexes such as the Langelier<br>
Saturation Index, the Stiff-Davis Index, and other solubility tables. These indexes,<br>
as is known to those with ordinary skill in the art and to whom this specification is<br>
directed, take as input the calcium, magnesium, alkalinity, pH, and temperature of<br>
operation to determine what amount, if any, of the scale causing ions present in the<br>
produced water must be reduced for scale free operation. Other tables, based on<br>
calcium sulfate and silica, are also used to determine the solubility levels and<br>
concentration factors attainable with these compounds in the produced water<br>
stream. After determining the scaling potential of the produced water, an<br>
embodiment of this novel process is chosen that will ensure scale free operation at<br>
the concentration factor required.<br><br><br>
[00100]	Referring to FIG. 4 or FIG. 5, following any produced water<br>
conditioning, as determined by the appropriate indexes and solubility charts, the<br>
herein disclosed novel high pressure, high efficiency HiPVap 84 must be operated<br>
in such a manner that the pH of the blowdown is approximately, but preferably not<br>
higher than, 12.5. Trie selected pH is based on the amount of silica in the produced<br>
water feed stream along with the concentration factor required and may be lower,<br>
but not lower than 10.5, depending on site specific design conditions.<br>
[00101]	FIG. 4 represents the HiPVap process as it would be incorporated into<br>
a SAGD application with typical produced water containing low hardness and low<br>
alkalinity solutes. The necessary pretreatment and conditioning prior to the<br>
HiPVap process is accomplished by the addition of acid 52, such as sulfuric or<br>
hydrochloric, when necessary and or appropriate, to lower the pH sufficiently to<br>
convert bound carbonate alkalinity to gaseous carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide<br>
along with other non-condensable gasses (NCG) such as oxygen and nitrogen are<br>
then removed in the HiPVap deaerator 56. Following the deaerator 56, the<br>
produced water feed stream is then conditioned by the addition of caustic 62, such<br>
as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, to a pre-selected pH prior to the<br>
HiPVap 84 process.<br>
[00102]	In the HiPVap 84, the treated and conditioned produced water 78<br>
mixes with and dilutes the concentrated high solids stream present in line 88. This<br>
stream is recirculated with high pressure recirculation pump 90 and a small portion<br>
is removed as HiPVap blowdown through line 96 on each pass through the HiPVap<br>
84. The solutes in the produced feed water are concentrated in HiPVap 84 by<br>
removing water from the diluted recirculating solution in line 94 as it passes over<br>
the heat transfer surface. As depicted in Figure 4, the HiPVap utilizes falling thin<br>
film evaporation wherein the recirculated stream depicted by line 94 is thinly<br>
spread across the inner, or first, surface of a plurality of heat transfer tubes. A<br>
small portion of water is removed from the thin recirculating stream in the form of<br>
steam vapor driven by the high pressure steam in line 124 which is condensing on<br><br><br>
the outside of the heat transfer tubes. The water that has been removed, in the form<br>
of high temperature steam at the high pressures necessary for injection, and<br>
typically with less than 10 ppm (parts per million) of non-volatile solutes, is routed<br>
through line 100 directly to the steam injection well.<br>
[00103]	A commercial watertube boiler 110 operating on high quality ASME<br>
rated feed water supplies the high pressure steam, through line 124, that is required<br>
to drive the high pressure high efficiency HiPVap 84 wherein the high pressure<br>
steam transfers heat by condensing on the second surface of said plurality of heat<br>
transfer surfaces. The condensing steam descends by gravity to the bottom of the<br>
tubular heat transfer surface and is collected as condensate stream 120 and then<br>
returned to the commercial watertube boiler 110 wherein energy is supplied and the<br>
condensate is returned to its steam form to keep the evaporation process going.<br>
[00104]	A small boiler blowdown stream represented by line 114 is taken<br>
from the watertube boiler 110, and directed to the HiPVap 84 for recovery. The<br>
blowdown stream 114 is necessary to prevent buildup up of total dissolved solids<br>
(TDS) in the boiler due to venting and ensuing makeup water requirement and is<br>
typically less than 2% of the boiler capacity.<br>
[00105]	Makeup water for the watertube boiler 110 can be supplied by any of<br>
various means of producing deionized water. As depicted in Fig. 4, the makeup is<br>
supplied through line 204 by a small, high recovery, typically greater than 90%,<br>
reverse osmosis (RO) unit 200 that operates on good quality service or well water.<br>
Under these circumstances, the RO unit 200 provides high quality ASME grade<br>
permeate, which along with the industry standard conventional high pressure boiler<br>
chemical program 112, ensures trouble free operation of the watertube boiler 110.<br>
In other embodiments, the RO unit 200 can be replaced with an ion exchange<br>
column, of various types, to provide the ASME quality water required by watertube<br>
boiler 110.<br>
[00106]	The just described novel HiPVap process produces a high quality<br>
steam at pressures dependent on the individual site designs, typically ranging from<br><br><br>
200 to 1600 psig, which satisfies the 100% quality steam requirement needed for<br>
SAGD operation at a cost reduction when compared to OTSG and MVC processes.<br>
Ideally, and as depicted in Fig. 4 and 5, only one stream, HiPVap blowdown 96<br>
needs to be handled. The blowdown, as represented by line 96, from the HiPVap,<br>
84, can be disposed of by what is known as deep well injection, after flashing 130<br>
to atmospheric pressure, in areas where it is permissible and/or possible, off-site<br>
waste disposal facilities, or preferentially by a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) system.<br>
The flashed steam 134 is then sent to the condenser 30 for recovery.<br>
[00107]	DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT WITH ZLD<br>
[00108]	Referring to FIG. 5, an alternate embodiment of the present invention<br>
for the high pressure high efficiency HiPVap process on produced water is shown.<br>
It is a flow diagram for produced water that has been recovered from a steam flood<br>
process in which the amount of hardness and carbonate alkalinity are high enough<br>
that pre-conditioning is required to lower them to acceptable quantities for HiPVap<br>
operation. The zero liquid discharge (ZLD) concept is also illustrated in order to<br>
further understand the breadth of the process.<br>
[00109]	The production stream 2 coming from the well head containing a<br>
mixture of oil and water (e.g., 75% water and 25% oil), at a typical temperature of<br>
around 330° F, flows to the oil separation zone 8 after passing through the<br>
produced water pre-heater 4. After substantially all oil has been removed, typically<br>
to a residual content of 10-20 ppm by means as discussed previously, the produced<br>
water, now at a temperature around 190° F, flows via line 14 to the deionization<br>
zone 18 which incorporates weak acid cation (WAC) resins operating in the sodium<br>
form. In the WAC the calcium and magnesium cations are reduced to non-scaling<br>
levels by replacing them with sodium ions.<br>
[00110]	After calcium and magnesium removal in the deionization zone 18,<br>
the now softened produced water 24 flows to a direct contact condenser 30. In<br><br><br>
condenser 30, the produced water mixes with and condenses the steam vapor from<br>
the crystallizing effect 162 of the multiple effect ZLD system.<br>
[00111]	After the condenser 30, the mixed stream 34 is transferred to buffer<br>
storage tank 36 where distillate 186 from the ZLD system is added.<br>
[00112]	The outlet 42 from buffer storage tank 36, now at a temperature of<br>
about 205° F is pressurized to suppress boiling and routed via line 42 through<br>
produced water pre-heater 4, which adds about 100° F to the stream, and then to<br>
degasifier 56 through conduit 50. Acid 52 is added, as appropriate and as<br>
determined necessary by the different scaling indexes, to the effluent 50 from<br>
produced water pre-heater 4 to enhance non-hydroxide alkalinity destruction.<br>
Sufficient acid is added to lower the pH where bound carbonates are converted to a<br>
free gas carbon dioxide. Then, the carbon dioxide that has been created by acid<br>
addition is removed, along with other non-condensable gasses (NCG) 58 such as<br>
oxygen and nitrogen, preferably in a flash type degasifier 56 although a forced draft<br>
type degasifier could also be utilized.<br>
[00113]	Preferably, either hydrochloric (HO) or sulfuric (H2 S04) acid is used<br>
for lowering the pH although other acids will also work. In other embodiments,<br>
wherein the different scaling indexes indicate mat alkalinity removal is not required<br>
for scale free operation at elevated pH, the acid addition 52 and degasifier 56 are<br>
not utilized.<br>
[00114]	One precaution that should be observed is that both hardness and<br>
non-hydroxide forms of alkalinity should be at non-scaling levels in the produced<br>
water prior to upward pH adjustment for selected HiPVap operating conditions.<br>
Once these conditions are met, then the desired pH increase may be accomplished<br>
with any convenient caustic source, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or<br>
potassium hydroxide (KOH). Once this pretreatment has been thoroughly<br>
accomplished, then a HiPVap system can be safely operated at very high pH levels,<br>
in order to take advantage of the aforementioned silica solubility and corrosion<br>
resistance.<br><br><br>
[00115]	The treated and conditioned produced water is pressurized to the<br>
selected operating pressure with high pressure pump 70, typically 1000 psig, or<br>
greater, and directed to the high pressure high efficiency steam generator (HiPVap)<br>
84 through blowdown heat exchanger 76. A caustic 62 (base) is added, preferably<br>
by pumped injection of liquid solution, to increase the pH of the produced feed<br>
water 66 to a pre-selected level. The pH of the produced water is raised to a<br>
selected pH of at least about 10.0, or preferably to a range between 10 and 11, or<br>
otherwise in excess of 11, and most preferably to 12 or more and is maintained, at<br>
the selected operating level, in the HiPVap process.<br>
[00116]	The HiPVap 84 and water tube boiler 110 operations have been<br>
described in detail above and will not be repeated again since there are no changes<br>
in the process itself, even with the other embodiments incorporated described here.<br>
[00117]	Makeup water for the watertube boiler 110 is supplied through line<br>
204 by a small, high recovery, typically greater than 90%, reverse osmosis (RO)<br>
unit 200 that operates on high quality distillate from the multiple-effect ZLD<br>
system. Under these circumstances, the RO unit 200 provides high quality ASME<br>
grade permeate, which along with the industry standard conventional high pressure<br>
boiler chemical program 112, ensures trouble free operation of the water tube boiler<br>
110. The reject stream from the RO unit 200 is routed via line 208 to the<br>
crystallizer effect 162 of the ZLD system.<br>
[00118]	The high pressure high efficiency HiPVap blowdown represented by<br>
line 96 is directed through blowdown heat exchanger 76 where it gives up heat to<br>
the incoming produced water feed in line 74. The cooled blowdown in line 104, at<br>
a typical temperature of 500° F and at ninety per cent (90%) or less of the incoming<br>
produced water flow, containing the concentrated solutes originally present in the<br>
produced water 14 along with any chemicals used to lower and raise the pH can be<br>
disposed of by the standard approach used at individual sites. This includes<br>
flashing to recover lower temperature steam for other purposes and then holding the<br><br><br>
liquid portion on-site in waste evaporation ponds, trucking to a waste site, or<br>
injection into deep wells.<br>
[00119]	In the preferred embodiment as described herein, the blowdown<br>
stream depicted as line 104 is directed to the multiple-effect ZLD system as shown<br>
in FIG. 5 wherein increased recovery is accomplished. The first step in the ZLD<br>
process involves flashing the blowdown 104 to a lower pressure in flash tank 130.<br>
The flash tank 130 separates the HiPVap liquid blowdown 104 into a lower<br>
temperature steam line 134 and liquid stream 138 which are routed to Effect (1)<br>
142 which constitutes a primary concentrator evaporator. Effect (1) 142 is the first<br>
effect of effects (1), effect (2), etc, through effect (N) (wherein N is a positive<br>
integer equal to the number of effects) to successively recover a series of lower<br>
pressure steam flows which are utilized to drive evaporation in the succeeding<br>
effect. The first effects of the ZLD process gradually concentrate the blowdown<br>
from evaporator 84 prior to solute crystallization in effect (N) 162. The<br>
concentration effects 1,2, etc. may be falling film or rising film type evaporators<br>
while the N effect, or crystallizer, is typically of the forced circulation type.<br>
[00120]	The solutes in the recirculated blowdown stream, as represented by<br>
line 138, are concentrated by removing water from the recirculating solution as it<br>
passes over the heat transfer surface in effect 142. As depicted in FIG. 5, the<br>
evaporator utilizes falling thin film evaporation wherein the recirculated stream<br>
depicted by line 138 is thinly spread across the inner surface of a plurality of heat<br>
transfer tubes. A small portion of water is removed from the thin recirculating<br>
stream in the form of steam vapor driven by the flashed steam in line 134 which is<br>
transferring heat by condensing on the outside of the heat transfer tubes. The<br>
condensing steam descends by gravity to the bottom of the tubular heat transfer<br>
surface and is collected as condensate stream 160.<br><br><br>
[00121]	The condensate stream 160 is routed through effect (2) 152 where it<br>
is combined with the distillate 170 from effect (2) 152 and then through effect (N)<br>
162. The combined distillate/condensate 166 from all effects is then routed to the<br>
distillate heat exchanger 182 and then to storage 36 via line 186.<br>
[00122]	The steam vapor produced in effect (1) 142 is collected and directed<br>
to effect (2) 152 via line 144 to provide the driving force for evaporation. Line 148<br>
represents the concentrated blowdown from effect (1) 142 which is recirculated<br>
across the heat transfer surface in effect (2) 152 as was described for the preceding<br>
effect. The steam vapor 154 generated is routed to effect (N) 162 where it<br>
condenses and heats the recirculating solution in a forced circulation heat<br>
exchanger. The blowdown from effect (2) 158 is recirculated through the heat<br>
exchanger in effect (N) 162 and then flashed into a chamber where the highly<br>
concentrated solutes precipitate out of solution,<br>
[00123]	Line 178 represents the concentrated blowdown from effect (N) 162<br>
containing precipitated solids that can then be disposed of either by sending it to an<br>
on-site waste holding area for disposal or preferably in a solids dewatering device.<br>
Typical dewatering equipment consists of various type filter presses or centrifuges<br>
in which the suspended solids are removed from the mixed solution by filtration or<br>
centrifugal forces. The dewatered solids can then be trucked off either for disposal<br>
in a landfill site or, in some cases, sold for their value as inorganic salts. The<br>
filtrate is then sent back to the crystallizing effect (N) for further processing. In<br>
other installations, as applicable, the blowdown 178 is sent to a spray dryer and any<br>
water is removed from the mixed solution by the application of heat resulting in<br>
nothing left but salts of various types.<br>
[00124]	The vapor produced in the crystallizer effect (N) 162 is routed via<br>
conduit 174 to condenser 30 wherein it makes direct contact with the incoming de-<br>
oiled produced water 14 prior to storage buffer tank 36.<br><br><br>
[00125]	The final step in our novel process includes taking a portion of low<br>
solute condensate and distillate stream 186 for use as RO feed 196 after passing<br>
through heat exchanger 192. The high quality RO feed 196, which does not have<br>
any volatile organics, allows the RO unit 200 to produce ASME quality permeate<br>
water for feed to the watertube boiler 110.<br>
[00126]	It should be noted mat the use of a tubular falling film evaporator<br>
design for equipment 84,142, and 152 is provided only for purposes of enabling<br>
one skilled into this art to understand the evaporation process and is not intended to<br>
limit the process to the use of the same. Those familiar with the art will recognize<br>
that other designs, such as, for example, a rising film evaporator, or a natural,<br>
mechanical, or forced circulation evaporator, may be alternately utilized with the<br>
accompanying benefits and/or drawbacks that may be inherent in the alternative<br>
designs.<br>
[00127]	In other embodiments, and as suited to meet the particularized needs<br>
of a selected produced water chemistry, various forms of hardness removal may be<br>
utilized as long as the requirements for a resulting scale free environment in the<br>
HiPVap are met. These include a sodium form strong acid cation (SAC) exchange<br>
or a partial hardness removal utilizing a SAC exchange process followed by a<br>
polishing sodium form WAC or SAC. The benefit gained by SAC exchange is the<br>
use of sodium chloride (NaCl) as a regenerant as compared to the two-step sodium<br>
form WAC process which requires the use of acid and caustic to effect regeneration<br>
to the desired sodium form. Drawbacks of the SAC process are lower efficiencies<br>
wherein excess sodium chloride is required for regeneration resulting in a 10%<br>
to 15% increase over a WAC process, waste stream quantity for disposal, and<br>
hardness removal limitations in applications with TDS in excess of about 3 000<br>
ppm. However, there are applications where ease of use and relatively cheap cost<br>
of sodium chloride makes the SAC process a better choice than a WAC process as<br>
long as the effluent meets the scale free environment requirements for (he HiPVap<br>
process.<br><br><br>
[00128]	In yet another embodiment, produced water 14 is first treated in a<br>
weak acid cation (WAC) ion exchange unit, operated in the hydrogen form where<br>
hardness and bicarbonate alkalinity are simultaneously removed. For those cases<br>
where produced water 14 hardness is greater than alkalinity, operation of the weak<br>
acid cation ion exchange unit must be facilitated by addition of a source of<br>
alkalinity, such as by addition of an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (Na2<br>
CO3).<br>
[00129]	Regeneration of the resin is accomplished by use of conveniently<br>
available and cost effective acid. It is well known by those in the art that<br>
regeneration of WAC ion-exchange resins may proceed quite efficiently, at near<br>
stoichiometric levels (generally, not more than about one hundred and twenty<br>
percent (120%) of ideal levels). Preferably, hydrochloric acid may be used, since in<br>
such cases highly soluble calcium chloride would be produced, and the<br>
regeneration process would not pose the potential danger of formation of insoluble<br>
sulfate precipitates, such as calcium sulfate, even with high strength acids.<br>
However, by use of a staged regeneration procedure, i.e., by using a low<br>
concentration acid followed by a higher concentration acid, it is possible to reliably<br>
utilize other acids, including sulfuric acid (H2 SO4), while still avoiding undesirable<br>
precipitates on the resin. In this manner, hardness ions are solubilized to form<br>
soluble salts, which are then eluted from the resin bed.<br>
[00130]	ECONOMICS OF HiPVap STEAM GENERATION<br>
[00131]	An economic analysis of the prior art systems in comparison to a<br>
preferred embodiment (FIG. 5) of the novel process disclosed herein was<br>
undertaken to further demonstrate the reduced costs that can be realized in the<br>
generation of high pressure steam. The study included the four systems as detailed<br>
in Figures 1,2,3, and 5 along with the following process assumptions for all cases.<br><br><br>
[00132]	Inlet Water Analysis, as mg/l CaCO3, except pH and where noted:<br>
[00133]	Calcium (Ca)	13	Bicarbonate (HCO3)	188<br>
[00134]	Magnesium (Mg)	5	Carbonate (CO3)	0.3<br>
[00135]	Sodium (Na)	1579	Sulfate (SO4)	0.3<br>
[00136]	Potassium (K)	0.51	Chloride (Cl)	1410<br>
[00137]	Silica (SiO2)	180	Iron (Total as mg/l ion) 1.1<br>
[00138]	TDS	2179 as mg/l ion<br>
[00139]	pH	7.3	Temperature	80° C<br>
[00140]	Oil	10-20 mg/l Flow Rate	3750 GPM<br>
[00141]	Assumptions:<br>
[00142]	Produced water from the recovery well is available at 164° C for use<br>
within the different processes for heat exchange purposes.<br>
[00143]	All systems are zero liquid discharge (ZLD).<br>
[00144]	A once through steam generator (OTSG) has a water to steam<br>
conversion ratio of 80%.<br>
[00145]	Watertube boilers operate with a 2% blowdown rate.<br>
[00146]	Operating Cost Assumptions:<br>
[00147]	The cost of lime and magnesium oxide is the same.<br>
[00148]	The OTSGs and water tube boilers operate at the same efficiency for<br>
conversion of fuel absorbed heat. The fuel consumption, per unit heat transferred<br>
to the water, of the OTSGs and water tube boilers is the same in all cases.<br>
[00149]	Capital Cost Assumptions:<br>
[00150]	Scope of supply for all cases includes all equipment, instruments,<br>
valves, piping, and structural steel shown within boundaries of block flow<br>
diagrams.<br>
[00151 ]	Equipment and costs not included in the cost estimate:<br>
[00152]	Water storage tanks<br>
[00153]	Control systems (PLC, DCS, etc.)<br><br>
[00154]	Motor control centers (MCC) transformers, switchgear, etc.<br>
[00155]	Installation cost<br>
[00156]	Infrastructure cost for foundations, underground piping, power<br>
systems, etc.<br>
[00157]	Plant life is 30 years.<br><br><br><br>
[00158]	As can be seen in Tables 1 and 3, the power consumption and capital<br>
cost are lower when the high pressure, high efficiency HiPVap method of steam<br>
generation, as presented herein, is incorporated into the steam flooding oil recovery<br>
methods in current use. When the lower costs are included with other benefits of<br>
the HiPVap process, such as reduced complexity of operation, fewer unit processes<br>
as shown in Table 6, and increased corrosion resistance, it becomes apparent that<br>
the method, as taught herein, is a cost effective, novel, and new approach to<br>
overcoming aforementioned present day state of the art limitations and problems.<br>
[00159]	BENEFITS OF HiPVap PROCESS DESIGN AND OPERATION<br>
[00160]	Many exemplary and desirable process benefits provided by the<br>
HiPVap process design and operation were listed above. Detailed explanations of<br>
such benefits include:<br>
[00161 ]	(A) Fewer unit processes<br>
[00162]	It can be seen from Table 5 above that the HiPVap process is<br>
comprised of fewer individual unit operations than other steam generation<br>
processes. In the preferred embodiment as depicted by FIG. 5, the HiPVap process<br><br>
consists only of the high pressure evaporator and its accompanying commercial<br>
watertube boiler as a source of heat to drive the evaporation process. This feature<br>
reduces the complexity of produced water recovery for steam generation and leads<br>
to fewer operational and maintenance hours required.<br>
[00163]	The elimination of a requirement for a once through steam generator<br>
(OTSG) carries with it additional benefits chiefly of which is its designed -low<br>
water to steam efficiency. This design factor is based on the poor wetting of heat<br>
exchange surfaces exhibited in current equipment which, in turn, leads to tube burn<br>
out at high temperatures and recovery due to dry spots, and tube plugging. The<br>
HiPVap, in contrast, is designed for high salinity high scaling probability waters<br>
which, by necessity, requires that heat exchange surfaces be thoroughly wetted at<br>
all times. Therefore, the rate of recirculation water over the heat transfer surface is<br>
much greater than the rate of steam vapor generation ensuring that dry spots cannot<br>
occur and that scaling potential is minimized.<br>
[00164]	(B) Reduced Capital Cost<br>
[00165]	The lowered corrosion potential that results from operating the<br>
HiPVap process with a high pH in the concentrated circulating solution allows the<br>
use of lower cost materials for heat transfer tubes or plates and other wetted<br>
surfaces that are contacted by the concentrated solution, such as sump walls. This<br>
is an important advantage since the costs of these materials have a substantial<br>
impact on the capital cost of an evaporator. In most cases the use of high cost<br>
duplex and AL6XN (6 per cent minimum molybdenum) type stainless steels, which<br>
are normally used in high chloride salt solutions, can be eliminated in favor of<br>
lower grade materials such as carbon steel. In addition, fewer individual unit<br>
processes result in eliminated equipment and installation infrastructure costs.<br>
[00166]	(C) Reduced Operating Cost<br>
[00167]	The HiPVap process has a significant advantage over other<br>
evaporative processes in that high energy consuming mechanical vapor<br>
compressors are not required either in the steam generation phase or in the zero<br><br><br>
liquid discharge zone. The novel design disclosed herein operates entirely on heat<br>
and the recovery of waste heat in liquid blowdown streams. Other systems require<br>
large amounts of electrical power input for operation.<br>
[00168]	Produced water plant operating costs are also reduced due to<br>
minimizing, or eliminating, costly proprietary antiscalants and/or dispersants.<br>
Additional savings can be found by eliminating the need for seeded slurry operation<br>
at installations where the calcium and sulfate ions are at a high level in the<br>
produced water feed stream. Along with the cost of seeding evaporators with<br>
calcium sulfate crystals, there is also incurred costs associated with calcium<br>
chloride and/or sodium sulfate injected chemicals to provide enough precipitating<br>
ions to maintain the seed bed at many installations. Further savings can be realized<br>
by the reduction in frequency of cleaning operations, less expensive cleaning<br>
chemicals, less downtime for cleaning, and no requirement for costly physical<br>
cleaning operations. Still further, if the ZLD option is incorporated, the cost of<br>
disposing the waste blowdown is eliminated along with the requirement for<br>
freshwater makeup necessary to maintain process flows.<br>
[00169]	It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, including those<br>
made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained, and, since<br>
certain changes may be made in carrying out the above method and in construction<br>
of a suitable apparatus in which to practice the method and in which to produce the<br>
desired product as set forth herein, it is to be understood that the invention may be<br>
embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential<br>
characteristics thereof. For example, while exemplary designs for a falling film<br>
high pressure evaporator along with hardness and alkalinity control methods have<br>
been illustrated and described, other embodiments are also feasible to attain Hie<br>
result of the principles of the method disclosed herein. Therefore, it will be<br>
understood that the foregoing description of representative embodiments of the<br>
invention have been presented only for purposes of illustration and for providing an<br>
understanding of the invention, and it is not intended to be exhaustive or restrictive,<br><br><br>
or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. On the contrary, the<br>
