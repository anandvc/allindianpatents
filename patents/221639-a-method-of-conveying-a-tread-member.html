				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of conveying a tread member.<br>
This invention pertains to the art of methods and apparatuses for conveying materials, such as strip components on a belt conveyor, and more specifically to methods and apparatuses for conveying tire building components from a feeding extruder or other production location to a tire building drum on a belt conveyor which is capable of laterally adjusting the position of the<br>
/<br>
components without using guides. Background Art<br>
In the past, guides on conveyor belts such as pivoting steering rollers required strip component wrap-around to create traction for centering the component product which was often detrimental to the component. Also, self-feeding of many components through any type of rollers was unreliable.<br>
Other methods included shifting the entire cpnveyor laterally to center the product. However, this required more elaborate machinery and a large entry loop in the case of strip or web products. Large loops may cause product stretch and make self-feeding difficult.<br>
Another guiding method utilized curved modular belt conveyors however, the curves were static and did not act as active guides. Further, the belting typically used was more than twice the pitch length of that utilized by the present invention. Long pitch lengths introduce excessive speed undulation to the product due to chordal action at the sprockets.<br>
The present invention contemplates a new and improved flexible guide belt conveyor which is simple in design, effective in use, and overcomes the foregoing difficulties and others while providing better and more advantageous overall results. Disclosure of Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a new and unproved flexible guide belt conveyor is provided which allows for active guiding of a fragile strip component on a feeder conveyor without using guides in contact with the material of the strip component.<br>
More particularly, in accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a method of conveying a tread member to a tire building drum and aligning the tread member with a guideline of intervening conveyors and the drum including the steps of placing a tread member on a belt conveyor having an entrance end and an exit end, the method characterized by the steps of determining a location of the guideline of the tread member at the exit end of the belt conveyor using a sensor, transmitting the location of the guideline to a motion controller, and moving a<br>
transverse housing located at the exit end laterally to adjust the exit end of the belt conveyor to align the tread member with the guideline of a tire building drum.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of applying tire components to a tire building drum including the step of transferring the tire components on at least one belt conveyor having an entrance end and an exit end, the method characterized by the steps of determining a location of the guideline of the tread member at the exit end of the at least one belt conveyor by means of a sensor, activating a linear actuator to laterally move the transverse housing located at the exit end to adjust the exit end of at least one belt conveyor to align the tread member with a guideline of a tire building drum.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method of conveying a tread member (11) with a guideline (52) to a tire building drum (12) with a guideline and aligning said tread member (11) with said tire building drum (12) comprising the steps of placing said tread member (11) on a belt conveyor (16) having an entrance end (18) and an exit end (20), said method characterized by the steps of:<br>

said guideline (52) of said tread member (11) with said guideline of said tire<br>
building drum (12) in response to the determination of the location of said<br>
guideline (52) of said tread member (12) at said exit end (20).<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a belt conveyor having an entrance 18 end and an exit end 20, apparatus for adjusting said exit end 20 of a belt conveyor 16 including a laterally adjustable belt 28 characterized by:<br>
(a) said belt conveyor 16 having a fixed support 88 at an entry end 18, a laterally movable belt supporting transverse housing 76 at said exit end 20, and a servo motor drive 166 mounted on said transverse housing 76, at least two edge guides 100 mounted on said transverse housing 76 for guiding said belt 28 transversely at said exit end 20, and slide plates 94 mounted on said housing 76 to support and permit lateral movement of said belt 28 at said exit end 20.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a belt conveyor having an entrance (18) end and an exit end (20), apparatus for adjusting said exit end (20) of a belt conveyor 16 including a laterally adjustable belt (28) wherein:<br>
(a) said belt conveyor (16) having a fixed support (88) at an entry end (18), a laterally movable belt supporting transverse housing (76) at said exit end (20), and a servo motor drive (166) mounted on said transverse housing (76), at least two edge guides (100) mounted on said transverse housing (76) for guiding said belt (28) transversely at said exit end (20), and slide plates (94) mounted on said housing (76) to support and permit lateral movement of said belt (28) at said exit end (20).<br>

Figure 6 is a sectional view through the traversing section taken along line 6-6 of Figure 4; and,<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic plan view of the two conveyor system shown in Figures 5 and 6. Detailed Description of the Invention (optional)<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting the same, Figure 1A shows a side elevation of a conveyor assembly 10 for conveying strip materials such as a tire tread 11 to a tire building drum 12. The conveyor assembly 10 preferably includes at least one feed belt conveyor 16 having an entrance end 18 and an exit end 20 that is capable of carrying the tire tread 11. The feed belt conveyor 16 preferably utilizes a laterally flexible conveyor belt having linked modules 34 with links 36 joined by hinge pins 40, as shown in Figure 2. There is preferably a small amount of clearance between the links 36 of the modules 34, thereby<br>
permitting limited lateral shifting and flexibility of the conveyor belt 28. While the conveyor belt 28 described above is the preferred embodiment, any other type of conveyor belt 28 with lateral flexibility may be utilized with the present invention.<br>
With continuing reference to Figures 1A and 1B, the continuous tire tread 11 is conveyed by the feed conveyor 16 from a feeding position 30 to the exit end 20 and preferably has a guideline rib 52, as shown in Figure 3. The guideline rib 52 as shown in Figure 3 is along the centerline of tire tread 11. However, the guideline rib 52 may also be off center. The guideline rib 52 may be detected by a die-line sensor 58. The sensor 58 determines the relative location of the guideline rib 52 of the tire tread 11 and provides an analog signal that is transmitted to a motion controller assembly 64. The motion controller assembly 64 uses the analog signal for negative feedback to a position loop that controls the lateral location of the exit end 20 of the feed belt conveyor 16. Guiding occurs as a result of the feed belt conveyor 16 moving laterally in the direction of travel of the tire tread 11 in response to the negative feedback from the sensor 58. In the preferred embodiment, the sensor 58 consists of a retro-reflective infrared scanner and a DOS based PC-compatible computer and monitor.<br>
The motion controller 64 moves the exit end 20 of the feed belt conveyor 16 laterally at 90° to the direction of the feed conveyor 16. The exit end 20 of the feed belt conveyor 16 includes a lateral adjustable transverse housing 76. The entrance end 18 of the feed conveyor 16 is preferably fixed, and is supported by a fixed frame 88.<br>
The transverse housing 76, as viewed in Figure 6, preferably has a slider plate 94 to support the conveyor belt 28. As shown in Figure 4, guides 100, which may be made of plastic or any other suitable material, are preferably provided to ensure that the conveyor belt 28 is not skewed as it enters and leaves sprockets 106. Belt idler sprockets 112, and shafting (not shown) are mounted at the entrance end 18 of the feed conveyor 16, as shown in Figure 1A.<br>
With continuing reference to Figure 4, the transverse housing 76 which encloses the belt drive sprockets 106 and bearings 118 that support most of the weight of the transverse housing is carried on a hollow shaft 124. The remaining weight of the transverse housing 76 is carried by a ball bushing 130 on a shaft 132 mounted on the frame 88, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
Two ball spline nuts 136, 142 mounted on a drive shaft 144 are retained inside the hollow shaft 124 of the transverse housing 76. One ball spline nut 136 is keyed on its outside diameter 148 to the inside diameter 154 of the hollow shaft 124 for torque transmission. The drive shaft 144 which is supported by pillow blocks 160 and 162, is coupled to a servo motor drive 166.<br>
Lateral transverse movement of the hollow shaft 124 and transverse housing 76 is provided preferably by a dedicated DC motor-powered linear actuator 172 connected to the housing by arm 174 when activated and controlled by the motion controller 64.<br>
This assembly at the exit end 20 provides low friction lateral motion of the transverse housing 76. At the beginning of a strip component run, the transverse housing 76 is automatically positioned in its center position by the motion controller 64 of the linear actuator 172. The strip material 22 is placed on the feed conveyor 16 at a location on the conveyor belt 28 which is not critical. The strip material 22 is easily self fed through the guide section. The position of the strip material 22 exiting the feed belt conveyor 16 is monitored by the sensor 58. If an off center position of the strip material 22 is detected, the motion controller 64 moves the transverse housing 76 laterally by activating the linear actuator 172. The plastic guides 100 which are fixed to the transverse housing 76 force the belt 28 to move with the transverse housing 76. The radially extending part of the guides 100 act as fulcrums when the belt 20 shifts sideways. The inherent lateral flexibility of the conveyor belt 28 permits this movement while the slider plate 94 supports the belt as described above. The strip material 22 is accordingly presented to downstream equipment on center and in line with the guideline of the conveyor assembly 10.<br>
Heretofore, the present invention has been described with regards to a single belt feed conveyor 16. However, the invention may also be utilized for two or more belt feed conveyors 16', 16", as shown in Figure 5. Figures 6 and 7 show additional views of the two conveyor assembly as shown in Figure 5. In the case of two belt feed conveyors 16', 16", the hollow shafts 124', 124" are preferably keyed to the drive shaft 144 and coupled together. This allows for the two transverse housings 76',76" to be driven by a single motor. Slider plates 94', 95" not shown are similar to slider plate 94 shown in Figure 6 and support the laterally adjustable conveyor belts 28', 28".<br>
The multiple transverse housings 76',76" arrangement provides continued low friction independent lateral movement of the transverse housings as well as synchronized line speed of the conveyor belts 28',28". If non-synchronized speeds of conveyor belts 28',28" are desired, the splined hollow shafts 124', 124" may be uncoupled and driven by separate drives.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 A, after the strip material 22 such as tire tread 11 is conveyed by the feed conveyor 16 and is centered by the transverse housing 76, the tread 11 may be applied directly to a tire drum 12. In the preferred embodiment, as shown in Figures 1A and 2B, the<br>
tread 11 is centered by the transverse housing 76 and transferred to a cut conveyor 184 where it is cut by a cut conveyor knife 190. After being cut by the knife 190, the tread 196 has a leading end 202 and a tail end 208. The tread 196 which is still in the centered position is then transferred onto a tread applier 214 and conveyed to the tire building drum 12 where it is applied in the centered position to the drum.<br>
The method described above is typically used when the strip material 22 is a tread 11 and consists of tread material. The tread 11 shown and described in the preferred embodiment of Figures 1A and 1B, only requires the single feed conveyor 16 as described above.<br>
The preferred embodiments have been described, hereinabove. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above apparatus and methods may incorporate changes and modifications without departing from the general scope of this invention. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations in so far as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<br>
