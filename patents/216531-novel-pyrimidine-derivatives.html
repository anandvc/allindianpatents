Background of the Invention<br>
For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, various drugs such as antacid, anticholinergic agent, H2-receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitor have been used. The advent of omeprazole useful as a proton pump inhibitor has rekindled research activities in this field.<br>
However, it has been pointed out that the proton pump inhibition by omeprazole is irreversible, which may induce side effects. Accordingly, various attempts to develop a reversible proton pump inhibitor are being actively made. For example, European Patent Nos. 322133 and 404322 disclose quinazoline derivatives, European Patent No. 259174 describes quinoline derivatives, and WO 91/18887 offers pyrimidine derivatives, as a reversible proton pump inhibitor. Further, the present inventors have also reported quinazoline derivatives in WO 94/14795 and pyrimidine derivatives in WO 96/05177.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

6-position  of the  pyrimidine nucleus exhibit excellent  proton  pump  inhibition effects and possess the ability to attain a reversible proton pump inhibition.<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide novel pyrimidine derivatives having a substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline group at 4-position of the pyrimidine nucleus or substituents at the 2-, 5-, or 6-position of the pyrimidine nucleus, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide processes for preparing said compounds.<br>

10µl of dimethylsulfoxide was added to each of Groups 1 and 2; and to Group 3 was added 10µlof dimethylsulfoxide solution prepared by dissolving compound of Example at 5 different concentration(n=5x2). To Group 4, 10µ1 of the solution prepared by dissolving omeprazole in dimethylsulfoxide at 5 different concentration(37.6, 21.4, 12.2, 7.0 and 4.0µM) was added(n=5x2). 40mM Tris-HCl buffer(pH=6.0) was added thereto so as to make the total volume 400 µ 1.<br>
Thereafter, the test tube of each Group were placed at 37 °C for 30 minutes for the preincubation. 100µ1 ATP solution (6.6mM) was added until the reaction volume became 500µ1. After the reaction was carried out at 37 C for 30 minutes, 25% cold trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the enzyme reaction. The released inorganic phosphate was measured by an automatic analyzer(Express 550, corning).<br><br>
The difference between Group 1 and Group 2 represents the proton pump activity activated by K+ only. The IC5oS of Group 3 and 4 were calculated from Litchfield-wilcoxon equation[see, e.g., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 96, 99(1949)]. The concentrations of the test compounds inhibiting 50% of the proton pump activity are represented as IC50 in Table 1.<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table  1, the compounds of the present invention have an excellent proton pump inhibitory activity over omeprazole.<br>
Test 2 : Inhibition of gastric secretion<br><br>
In   accordance    with   the    method    disclosed    in    Shay.    H.,    et   al., Gastroenterology 5 43-61(1945), Test 2 was carried out.<br>
Sprague-Dawly  rats having a body weight of 170 ± 1 Og were divided into 3  groups(n=5) and deprived of food for 24 hours before the experiment with free access to water.  Under ether anesthesia, the abdomen was incised, and   the   pylorus   was   ligated.   As   a   comparative   group,   Group    1    was administered   intraduodenally   in   a   volume   of  0.5ml/200g   of  30%   aqueous polyethylene   glycol    400    solution.    Groups    2    and    3    were    administered intraduodenally    with the compound of Example and omeprazole, respectively, each of which was suspended in 30% aqueous polyethylene glycol 400 solution at a concentration of 20mg/kg.    After closing the abdominal cavity, the rats were placed for 5 hours and then killed by cervical dislocation. The stomach was extracted to obtain gastric juice,<br>
Tne gastric juice was centrifuged at l,000g to remove precipitates. The amount and acidity of the gastric juice were measured. Relative volumes, relative acid concentrations and relative acid outputs of the test compounds were calculated from equations( I), (II) and (III) and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Relative volume = (the average amount of gastric juice of Group 1 -the average amount of gastric juice of Group 2) / (the average amount of gastric juice of Group 1 - the average amount of gastric juice of Group 3) — (I)<br>
Relative acid concerntration = (the average acidity of Group 1 - the average acidity of Group 2) / (the average acidity of Group 1 - the average acidity of Group 3) — (II)<br>
Relative acid output = (the total amount of acid output of Group 1  -<br><br>
the total amount of acid output of Group 2) / (the total amount of acid output of Group 1 - the total amount of acid output of Group 3) — (III)<br>
The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2.<br><br>
