				<td>MOBILE RADIO ANTENNA HAVING A REFLECTOR<br>
The invention relates to a mobile radio antenna having an associated<br>
reflector.<br>
Mobile radio antennas for mobile radio base stations are normally-<br>
constructed such that two or more antenna element arrangements, which<br>
are located one above the other, are provided in the vertical<br>
direction in front of a reflector plane. These antenna element<br>
arrangements are formed, for example, from dipoles or patch antenna<br>
elements. These may be antenna element arrangements which can<br>
transmit, and can transmit and receive at the same time, only in one<br>
polarization or, for example, in two mutually perpendicular<br>
polarizations. The entire antenna arrangement may in this case be<br>
designed for transmission in one band or in two or more frequency-<br>
bands by using, for example, two or more antenna elements and antenna<br>
element groups which are suitable for the various frequency bands.<br>
Depending on the requirements, mobile radio antennas are required<br>
which have different length variants. The length variants in this<br>
case depend, inter alia, on the number of individual antenna elements<br>
or antenna element groups to be provided, in which case identical or<br>
similar antenna element arrangements are generally arranged<br>
repeatedly one above the other.<br>
An antenna such as this or an antenna array such as this in this case<br>
has a common reflector for all the antenna element arrangements. This<br>
common reflector is normally formed by a reflector plate which may be<br><br>
stamped, curved and bent depending on the requirement,<br>
in order, for example, to make it possible to form a<br>
reflector edge area, which projects forwards from the<br>
reflector plane, on the two opposite side vertical<br>
edges. Furthermore, if required, additional sheet-metal<br>
parts may be soldered on the reflector. The use of<br>
profiles is also known, for example extruded profiles<br>
made of aluminum etc., which are likewise fitted on or<br>
in front of the reflector plane. Antenna arrangements<br>
having reflectors whose longitudinal faces have<br>
longitudinal webs which project forwards from the<br>
reflector plane have been disclosed, for example, in<br>
WO 99/62138 Al, US 5,710,569 A or EP 0 916 169 Bl.<br>
However, costly, complex, three-dimensional functional<br>
surfaces for the antenna element arrangements are<br>
advantageous, or even necessary, for certain<br>
applications. Until now, a large number of connecting<br>
points and contact points have been required on the<br>
reflector in order to produce such surrounding<br>
conditions for the antenna element arrangement. Some of<br>
the parts and components which are used are in this<br>
case also still in some cases made of different<br>
materials. However, this results in a number of<br>
disadvantages. Firstly, the large number of different<br>
parts and the major assembly effort associated with<br>
them are disadvantageous.overall these result in<br>
comparatively high production costs. However, another<br>
disadvantage is the large number of contact points.<br>
However, a large number of contact points can<br>
contribute to undesirable intermodulation products.<br>
Adequate functional reliability can in this case be<br>
achieved only by taking the greatest possible care<br>
during assembly. On the other hand, the antennas that<br>
are produced in this way always have a restricted<br>
function and load capability since, particularly in the<br>
case of unsuitable material combinations or even if<br>
there are only a small number of bad contact points, it<br><br>
may not be possible to comply with the requirements relating to the<br>
undesirable intermodulation products. If a test run of the checked<br>
polar diagram of an antenna reveals problems, then in this case it is<br>
also not immediately possible to state which contact points may have<br>
contributed to the deterioration in the intermodulation<br>
characteristics.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an<br>
improved capability to produce antennas with high quality<br>
characteristics, by means of which it is furthermore intended to be<br>
possible to produce antennas of different physical sizes with<br>
comparatively little complexity and to a high quality standard.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by the features of<br>
the reflector for a mobile radio antenna, as described hereinafter.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified in the<br>
following detailed description of the invention.<br>
The invention proposes a solution for constructing different length<br>
variants of antennas with the same or a similar function with<br>
comparatively little complexity. In this case, the reflector devices<br>
may also be used for antennas of different construction which may,<br>
for example, hold different antenna elements or antenna element<br>
assemblies. Finally, even complex, three-dimensional surrounds with<br>
functional surfaces in the transverse and/or longitudinal direction<br>
or in other directions of the reflector can be produced using simple<br>
means. Functional surfaces such as these may, however, also be<br>
produced, for example, aligned at an angle to the major axis, that is<br>
to say generally at an angle to the vertical axis in which the<br>
reflector extends.<br>
At the same time, the antenna or reflector<br>
configuration according to the invention makes it<br><br>
possible to considerably reduce the number of contact<br>
points. In turn, this makes it possible to reduce the<br>
large number of different parts and the assembly<br>
effort, with a high degree of functional integration as<br>
well.<br>
The invention now provides for a reflector to be<br>
constructed from at least two separate reflector<br>
modules, which may be mounted jointly, for example in<br>
the vertical direction in an extension of their<br>
vertical axis. In order to produce an overall<br>
arrangement which is mechanically robust from at least<br>
two or more reflector modules which can be fitted to<br>
one another in the vertical direction, and which<br>
overall arrangement furthermore also has the desired<br>
characteristic values from the electrical point of view<br>
for the antenna element arrangement which is provided<br>
on each reflector module, at least the basic version of<br>
each reflector module is formed integrally,<br>
specifically preferably using a casting, deep-drawing,<br>
thermoforming, stamping or milling method. The<br>
expression master gauge method is also used in this<br>
connection in some cases. The reflector module may<br>
thus, for example, be formed from an aluminium cast<br>
part or generally from a metal casting or else from a<br>
plastic injection-molded part, which is then provided<br>
with a metalized surface on one surface, or at least on<br>
both opposite surfaces. The invention can also be<br>
produced using a tixo casting method or else, for<br>
example, by milling, in this case, the reflector module<br>
preferably has a circumferential rim, at least on its<br>
two longitudinal faces and on at least one narrower<br>
transverse face, but preferably on both of its<br>
longitudinal faces and on both of its end faces. Thus,<br>
not only are lateral boundary webs or boundary surfaces<br>
which project transversely with respect to the<br>
reflector plane provided on the two opposite vertical<br>
faces but, in addition, one or in each case one<br><br>
boundary web or a boundary surface is provided on at<br>
least one of the end faces, and preferably on both<br>
opposite end faces. Each reflector module in this case<br>
also has at least one fixed integrated central<br>
transverse web, which comprises at least one upper and<br>
one lower field for antenna element arrangements which<br>
can be used there. At least two antenna element<br>
surrounds are thus defined for each reflector module<br>
and these antenna element surrounds are produced by an<br>
end-face boundary wall, two sections of the vertical<br>
side longitudinal boundaries and the at least one web<br>
wall which runs transversely with respect to the side<br>
boundary walls.<br>
Fundamentally, a reflector module formed in this way is<br>
then also suitable for being joined to at least one<br>
further reflector module, for example of the same<br>
physical type, at the end face to form an entire<br>
reflector arrangement with a greater vertical extent.<br>
One preferred embodiment provides for a final reflector<br>
to be formed from at least two reflector modules which<br>
are joined together with the same orientation. In an<br>
alternative refinement of the invention, it is also<br>
possible to join the end faces of two reflector modules<br>
together, with the two reflector modules being aligned<br>
with their basic shapes at 180° to one another. This<br>
assembly has been found to be particularly advantageous<br>
when the two opposite end face surfaces have different<br>
shapes, that is to say when only one end face surface<br>
is suitable for actually joining it to a next reflector<br>
module.<br>
Finally, however, reflector modules may also be joined<br>
together with different shapes but with a comparable<br>
basic structure, as described above.<br><br>
As is known, the forces which act on a reflector and<br>
the operating loads which are produced by the actions<br>
of these forces, for example resulting from vibration,<br>
wind and storms, should not be underestimated. Loads<br>
such as these naturally occur particularly strongly at<br>
the junction point in a reflector arrangement according<br>
to the invention when using at least two modules whose<br>
end faces are joined together. In this case, however,<br>
moving and undefined contacts should also not be used<br>
in order to avoid undesirable intermodulation problems.<br>
One particularly preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
therefore provides for the corresponding end walls,<br>
i.e. the end-face transverse webs, to be appropriately<br>
matched for joining together at least two reflector<br>
modules and, for this purpose, for them preferably to<br>
have attachment points which are offset with respect to<br>
one another in two planes. This makes it possible<br>
firstly to transmit and to absorb comparatively large<br>
moments, while at the same time providing functionally<br>
reliable electrical contact points. In this case, an<br>
electrically conductive contact can be made between the<br>
two reflector modules in the area of their end walls<br>
that are joined together, or else they can also be<br>
connected to one another without any electrically<br>
conductive connection, for example by inserting an<br>
insulating intermediate layer, for example a plastic<br>
layer or some other dielectric, between them. In some<br>
circumstances, a damper material can also preferably be<br>
used for the intermediate joint for an insulating layer<br>
such as this, which means that the two reflector module<br>
halves may even oscillate to a certain extent with<br>
respect to one another, to a restricted extent, even in<br>
a severe storm. This thus serves to improve the<br>
mechanical reliability.<br>
The offset plane of the attachment points, that has<br>
been mentioned, also serves to ensure that shape<br><br>
discrepancies are not additive at the connecting<br>
interface or, if necessary, can be compensated for with<br>
comparatively few problems, that is to say in other<br>
words in such a way that production tolerances can be<br>
compensated for. If, for optimization of the polar<br>
diagram of an antenna, it is necessary to attach<br>
additional metallic elements at specific points in the<br>
reflector, then, in one development of the invention,<br>
these additional elements may be used, for example, in<br>
the form of electrically conductive strips, webs etc.,<br>
by means of separate holding devices, preferably<br>
electrically nonconductive holding devices which are<br>
preferably formed from plastic or from some other<br>
dielectric, which can be fitted to the existing<br>
intermediate webs or side boundary wall sections, and<br>
between which the metallic elements which have to be<br>
inserted in addition can then be hooked in. This<br>
capacitive anchoring then once again furthermore avoids<br>
undesirable intermodulation products.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
provides for a reflector module which has been produced<br>
using a casting, deep-drawing, thermoforming or<br>
stamping method, or for example alternatively using a<br>
milling method, preferably to have further integrated<br>
parts, or parts of further components, which are<br>
required in particular in conjunction with an antenna,<br>
on the rear face of the reflector module, opposite the<br>
antenna element modules. This allows functional<br>
integration to be achieved in the reflector, associated<br>
with further significant advantages. The following<br>
functional elements may, for example, be integrated in<br>
the reflector module without any problems:<br>
It is thus possible also to integrally form outer<br>
conductor contours for carrying radio-frequency<br>
signals, for example a grooved cable, coaxial cable,<br><br>
stripline etc., on the front face or else in particular<br>
also on the rear face of the reflector.<br>
In the same way, contours may be integrally formed<br>
for electromagnetic screening of assemblies.<br>
Housing parts for RF components such as filters,<br>
diplexers, distributors and phase shifters may also be<br>
integrally formed, such that all that need be done<br>
after incorporation of the additional functional parts<br>
in these assemblies is to fit a cover as well.<br>
Particularly if metalized plastic parts are used<br>
as the basis for the reflector, complete cable<br>
structures can also be integrated by suitable measures<br>
such as hot stamping, two-component injection molding<br>
methods, laser processing, etching methods or the like<br>
("three-dimensional printed circuit board").<br>
Finally, however, interfaces for holding<br>
components for attachment or mounting as well as<br>
interfaces for accessories, for example in the form of<br>
attachment flanges, heat flanges etc., can also be<br>
provided.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the<br>

Figure	1 shows a schematic plan view of a reflector 1<br>
which,	in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, is<br>
formed	from two reflector modules 3 whose end faces are<br>
joined	together and in each of which four antenna<br><br>
element arrangements 2 are arranged one above the other<br>
in the vertical direction. The illustrated antenna<br>
element modules are, from the electrical point of view,<br>
modules in the form of cruciform antenna elements which<br>
radiate, that is to say can transmit and receive, two<br>
mutually perpendicular polarizations. These are<br>
preferably antenna elements arranged in an X-shape, in<br>
which the polarization planes are aligned at angles of<br>
plus 45° to minus 45° with respect to the horizontal<br>
and vertical. This specifically illustrated and<br>
indicated type of antenna element is known for example,<br>
from the prior application WO 00/39894. To this extent,<br>
reference is made to this prior application, which is<br>
included in the content of the present application.<br>
However, instead of this, any other desired antenna<br>
element arrangements, for example in the form of dipole<br>
squares, cruciform antenna elements, single-polarized<br>
dipole antenna elements or other antenna elements or<br>
antenna element devices, including patch antenna<br>
elements, may also be used.<br>
The reflector as described in more detail above and in<br>
the following text is intended in particular for a<br>
mobile radio antenna, that is to say in particular for<br>
a corresponding antenna in a base station (base station<br>
antenna).<br>
As can also be seen in particular from the perspective<br>
illustration in Figure 2, each reflector module has in<br>
each case two longitudinal webs 5 provided on the<br>
longitudinal face regions and two end-face transverse<br>
face webs 7 (which are also referred to below for short<br>
as transverse webs 7), which are formed in a manner of<br>
a reflector boundary wall or boundary web, boundary<br>
flange etc., and project transversely with respect to<br>
the plane of the reflector 1, preferably at right<br>
angles to the plane of the reflector plate. The height<br>
above the plane 1' of the reflector 1 may in this case<br><br>
be modified, and differ within wide ranges, depending<br>
on the desired characteristic polar diagram properties<br>
of an antenna constructed in this way.<br>
The reflector modules 3 are, for example, using a metal<br>
die-casting method, using an injection-molding method<br>
for example in the form of a plastic injection-molding<br>
method, in which the plastic is then coated on at least<br>
one face, preferably all the way round, at least with a<br>
conductive metalized surface. However, in principle, it<br>
would also be possible to use reflector parts which may<br>
have been produced using a deep-drawing or<br>
thermoforming method, a stamping method, using a so-<br>
called tixo casting method, or else, for example, by<br>
means of a milling method. In places, the following<br>
text also speaks of a master gauge method, although<br>
this term does not cover all the production methods<br>
mentioned above.<br>
In the described exemplary embodiment, each of the<br>
reflector modules also has four transverse webs 9 which<br>
are arranged spaced apart from one another at the<br>
vertical interval of the illustrated reflector, and<br>
which are likewise also produced using a master gauge<br>
method as mentioned above. In the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment, five antenna element surrounds are produced<br>
in this way for each reflector module 3 and are each<br>
formed by a section of the two outer side boundary<br>
walls and by two central or transverse webs 9, which<br>
are spaced apart from one another, or by a transverse<br>
web 9 and one of the two end-face boundary walls 7.<br>
A series of holes are incorporated by means of<br>
apertures 13 in the plane 1' of the reflector 1 in each<br>
such antenna element surround 11, on which the desired<br>
single-polarized or, for example, dual-polarized<br>
antenna element modules can then be firmly anchored and<br>
fitted to the reflector 1. The antenna element modules<br><br>
themselves, in particular dipole antenna element<br>
structures or patch antenna element structures, may<br>
have widely different shapes. In this context,<br>
reference is made to already known antenna elements and<br>
antenna element types which are common knowledge to<br>
those skilled in the art. Merely by way of example,<br>
reference is in this context made to the antenna<br>
element structures which are known from the prior<br>
 publications DE 198 23 749 Al or WO 00/39894, which are<br>
 all suitable for the present situation. In the same<br>
way, the reflector module may also be used for antennas<br>
and antenna arrays which transmit and receive not only<br>
in one frequency band but in two or more frequency<br>
bands by, for example, fitting antenna element<br>
arrangements which are suitable for different frequency<br>
bands in the individual antenna element surrounds. To<br>
this extent, reference is once again made to already<br>
known fundamental solutions. Thus, in other words, the<br>
antenna elements which can be formed in the antenna<br>
element surrounds comprise, for example, dipole antenna<br>
elements, that is to say single dipole antenna elements<br>
which operate in only one polarization or in two<br>
polarizations, for example comprising cruciform dipole<br>
antenna elements or dipole antenna elements in the form<br>
of a dipole square, so-called vector dipoles which<br>
transmit and receive cruciform beams, such as those<br>
which are known from WO 00/39894, or antenna element<br>
arrangements which can transmit and receive in one<br>
polarization or two mutually perpendicular<br>
polarizations, for example also using two or three<br>
frequency bands, or more, rather than just one. This<br>
also applies to the use of patch antenna elements. To<br>
this extent, the arrangement of the reflector modules<br>
is not restricted to specific antenna element types.<br>
In the described exemplary embodiment, the reflector 1<br>
is assembled in two identical antenna element modules<br>
3, to be precise with them being joined together at<br><br>
their end-face or transverse face boundaries 7 that are<br>
provided for this purpose. This is because a threaded<br>
hole attachment 15, which projects in the fitting<br>
direction and whose axial axis is aligned transversely<br>
with respect to the plane of the reflector plate, is<br>
provided there, offset from the central longitudinal<br>
plane, (that is to say from a central longitudinal<br>
plane which runs in the center of the reflector 1, in<br>
its longitudinal direction, and is at right angles to<br>
the reflector plane) towards the outer edge, and<br>
preferably extending over part of the height<br>
transversely with respect to the reflector plane 1' . A<br>
threaded hole attachment 17 which projects inwards is<br>
then formed on the other side to the abovementioned<br>
vertical central longitudinal plane, in such a way<br>
that, with antenna element modules 3 which are aligned<br>
offset through 180° with respect to one another, as<br>
illustrated in Figures 2 to 4, the end face side<br>
boundary surfaces 7 of these two antenna element<br>
modules 3 can now be moved towards one another so that<br>
the respective threaded hole attachment 15 which<br>
projects on each end face of the respective antenna<br>
element module 3 engages in a corresponding recess or<br>
hole 17' on the other end face of the adjacent antenna<br>
element module 3, which is adjacent in the axial<br>
direction to the threaded hole attachment 17 which<br>
projects inwards. In this case, the threaded hole 15'<br>
which is incorporated in the attachment 15 which<br>
projects on each end face comes to rest, in a plane<br>
view, directly in an axial extension underneath the<br>
hole 17' in the attachment 17, which projects inwards,<br>
on the respective second reflector module 3, so that a<br>
screw 18 can be screwed into the threaded holes 15' or<br>
holes 17' , which are each arranged in pairs one above<br>
the other. In this case, the hole 17' preferably has an<br>
at least slightly larger internal diameter, compared<br>
with the internal cross section of the threaded hole<br>
15', so that the relevant screw can be passed freely<br><br>
through the hole 17' without becoming jammed. Finally,<br>
instead of a threaded hole 15', it is possible to<br>
provide just an unthreaded hole, specifically when an<br>
appropriate self-tapping screw is screwed into this<br>
hole 15'. The corresponding attachments 15 and 17 are<br>
thus provided at different heights on each transverse<br>
web 7, which is also sometimes referred to below as<br>
transverse boundary wall 7, on each of the two<br>
reflector modules 3, so that they can be joined<br>
together in a relative position rotated through 180°,<br>
as shown in Figures 3a and 3b. The overall dimensions<br>
and shapes in this case are such that the two end-face<br>
transverse webs 7 of the two reflector modules 3 make a<br>
fixed contact with one another in this position, and<br>
only in this position.<br>
Since, furthermore, the threaded hole attachments 15<br>
and 17 are offset outwards from the vertical central<br>
longitudinal plane and are each formed at a different<br>
height on each reflector module 3 (with respect to the<br>
plane 1' of the reflector 1), this results in optimum<br>
two-point support, which can absorb high forces,<br>
including wind and vibration forces.<br>
If necessary, before the two end-face transverse webs 7<br>
of the two reflector modules are joined together, an<br>
intermediate material, which is used as a damper, can<br>
also be inserted like a sandwich between the two end<br>
faces 7, which rest against one another, of two<br>
adjacent reflector modules 3 which are fitted to one<br>
another. This also makes it possible to allow the two<br>
reflector modules to oscillate with respect to one<br>
another to a minor extent, which may have advantages,<br>
particularly when the antenna is subject to very strong<br>
forces in severe storms, and to vibration.<br>
As can also be seen from Figures 3a, 3b and 4, it is<br>
also possible to use additional connecting lugs 21,<br><br>
which connect the two reflector modules 3, from each of<br>
which a screw 23 can be screwed in one reflector module<br>
3, and the second screw 24 can be screwed in from the<br>
bottom face of the respective other reflector module 3.<br>
The one or more connecting lugs in this case overhang<br>
the separating surface which separates the two<br>
reflector modules 3.<br>
The following text refers to Figure 5, which shows a<br>
detail of two radiation surrounds 11 of a reflector<br>
module.<br>
In this case, nonconductive holding or attachment<br>
devices 27 are fitted to each of the existing<br>
transverse webs 9, which are formed in the course of<br>
the master gauge process, and these holding or<br>
attachment devices 27 are provided with recesses in the<br>
form of slots, in order in this case to make it<br>
possible, for example, to use a further electrically<br>
conductive functional parts which are used for beam<br>
forming and/or for decoupling and which, to be precise,<br>
can be used capacitively. This is because the holding<br>
and attachment devices 27 are electrically<br>
nonconductive, and are preferably made of plastic or<br>
from some other suitable dielectric. The capacitive<br>
attachment of the said functional parts 29 likewise<br>
further suppresses undesirable intermodulation<br>
products. Furthermore, the supplementary attachment and<br>
incorporation which may be required in the radiation<br>
surrounds 11 by means of the said holding and<br>
attachment device 27 is comparatively simple and is<br>
feasible in a very highly variable manner.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, it is likewise possible<br>
(although this is not illustrated in any more detail in<br>
the drawing) for the holding and attachment devices 27<br>
that have been mentioned not to be provided, or to be<br>
provided not only on the transverse webs 9, but, for<br><br>
example, also on the transverse face boundaries 7<br>
and/or on the longitudinal face boundaries 5, that is<br>
to say such that they can be anchored there, for<br>
example by fitting them in place, snapping them on,<br>
etc.<br>
Furthermore - as can also be seen from the drawings,<br>
for example Figure 5 - further anchoring sections 28,<br>
which are provided with holes 31 that are aligned<br>
transversely with respect to the plane 1' of the<br>
reflector, are provided on the transverse struts 9 that<br>
are provided in the factory, to which anchoring<br>
sections 28 it is possible to fit, for example,<br>
additional components which are used for beam forming<br>
and/or for decoupling, for example functional parts in<br>
the form of pins or rods etc. which extend at right<br>
angles to the plane 1' of the reflector. The holes 31<br>
thus extend at right angles to the plane 1' of the<br>
reflector, with the holding and attachment devices 28<br>
being in the form of reinforcing sections in the<br>
transverse struts 9 or else, if . required and as shown<br>
in the illustration in Figures 3a and 3b on the<br>
transverse face boundaries 7.<br>
The following text refers to Figures 6 and 7.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 will be used, by way of example only,<br>
to describe how further functional parts 29 can be<br>
integrated on the reflector in the course of the<br>
production method, which has been mentioned, for the<br>
reflector modules, preferably on their lower face (but<br>
if necessary also on the upper face to which the<br>
antenna elements are fitted).<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show outer conductor sections of a<br>
connecting and feed structure on the lower face for two<br>
antenna elements which are located vertically adjacent.<br>
The outer conductor contour which projects downwards<br><br>
from the plane 1' of the reflector 1 and is in the form<br>
of a circumferential housing web 3 5 is in this case<br>
used as an outer conductor. Inner conductors 43, for<br>
example, can then be anchored therein via holding<br>
devices 37, which can be inserted between these housing<br>
webs 35, are preferably nonconductive and are made of<br>
plastic. Coaxial cables 41 for example, can then be<br>
connected via feed points 39 that are likewise<br>
provided, by, for example, making electrically<br>
conductive contact between the outer conductor of the<br>
coaxial cable and the circumferential housing web 35,<br>
which carries out the outer conductor function while,<br>
on the other hand and electrically isolated from this<br>
the inner conductor of the coaxial cable is<br>
electrically conductively connected at some suitable<br>
point to the inner conductor 43 which is provided in<br>
the interior of the distributor formed in this way. The<br>
inner conductor is then passed so far in this<br>
connecting structure and is passed via one of the holes<br>
that are provided in the reflector plate to the other<br>
reflector plane, in order to produce an electrically<br>
conductive connection there for the antenna elements<br>
that are provided there.<br>
However, other functional parts may likewise also be<br>
provided in the reflector according to the invention,<br>
that is to say not only outer conductor structures and<br>
outer conductor contours for cables for radio-frequency<br>
signals, for example in the form of grooved cables,<br>
coaxial cables or striplines, but, for example, also<br>
contours for electromagnetic screens, housing parts for<br>
RF components such as filters, diplexers, distributors,<br>
phase shifters or, for example, also in the form of<br>
interfaces for holders, attachments, accessories etc.<br>
The exemplary embodiments which have been explained<br>
have been used to describe how two identical antenna<br>
element modules can be joined firmly together by in<br><br>
each case one end wall-face transverse web 7. The<br>
opposite end faces are in this case of different<br>
designs, so that they can be joined together according<br>
to the exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 3 to 4 on<br>
only one end web 7. For this purpose, the identically<br>
shaped reflector modules 3 are aligned rotated through<br>
180° relative to one another in order to join them<br>
together. However, differently shaped antenna element<br>
modules can also be joined together in the vertical<br>
direction if they are each designed appropriately on at<br>
least one end wall, in order to make it possible to fix<br>
them firmly to one another there via a suitable holding<br>
and attachment device 27. Finally, however, more than<br>
two reflector modules, for example three or four etc.,<br>
can also be joined together in the vertical direction<br>
or else in the horizontal direction at the sides to<br>
form an entire antenna array. If two or more reflector<br>
modules are joined together vertically, all that is<br>
then necessary is for at least the reflector modules<br>
which are arranged in the central area to be configured<br>
both on their upper and on their lower end wall regions<br>
7 such that they can be joined to a next reflector<br>
module which is located adjacent.<br>
The special feature of the functional parts which are<br>
to be mentioned is thus that a part of an additional<br>
functional part, for example the outer boundary which<br>
is used as an outer conductor is part of the reflector<br>
arrangement for a connecting device or for a phase<br>
shifter right from the start, so that these components<br>
just need to have further functional components or<br>
other components added to them to achieve a complete<br>
assembly.<br>
The following text also refers to Figure 8, which<br>
illustrates a further example for a different<br>
functional part. An outer boundary, that is to say a<br>
circumferential housing web 35 is shown here, connected<br><br>
to the reflector material and on the same level. The<br>
reflector itself in this case forms the bottom, while<br>
the housing web 35 forms the outer boundary. This<br>
functional part 29 may be used, for example, as a phase<br>
shifter arrangement which is provided on the rear face<br>
of the reflector. The phase shifters may in this case<br>
be constructed in the manner which is known in<br>
principle from the prior publication WO 01/13459 Al. To<br>
this extent, reference is made to this prior<br>
publication, whose contents are included in the present<br>
application. Thus, one or more concentrically arranged<br>
stripline sections, which are in the form of partial<br>
circles, can be accommodated in the corresponding<br>
configuration shown in Figure 8 and interact with a<br>
pointer-like adjustment element, via which the path<br>
length to the two connected antenna elements or antenna<br>
element groups, and hence the phase angle for the<br>
antenna element, can be adjusted and set in order, for<br>
example, to make it possible to set a different down<br>
tilt angle. Any other desired different types of<br>
functional parts with other functions and tasks may be<br>
formed at least partially, in precisely the same way in<br>
the factory, on the reflector, preferably on its rear<br>
face. Once the further elements that are to be<br>
installed (but which are not shown in the drawings) for<br>
the functional part have been installed appropriately,<br>
the installation space which is formed by the reflector<br>
base and the circumferential housing web 35 can be<br>
closed by attaching and fitting a cover arrangement<br>
which, depending on the application, is electrically<br>
conductive, preferably formed from a metal part, or can<br>
otherwise also be formed from a plastic or dielectric<br>
part or the like.<br><br>
