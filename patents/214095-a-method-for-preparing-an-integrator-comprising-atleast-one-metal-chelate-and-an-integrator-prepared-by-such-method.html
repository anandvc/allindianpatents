				<td>A METHOD FOR PREPARING AN INTEGRATOR COMPRISING ATLEAST ONE METAL<br>
CHELATE AND AN INTEGRATOR PREPARED BY SUCH METHOD<br>
The present invention relates in general to a method for preparing<br>
an integrator comprising at least one metal chelate and an<br>
integrator prepared by such method and in particular to the use in<br>
human and animal nutrition (monogastric and polygastric animals) of<br>
known chelates of bivalent metals Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Fe with<br>
methionine hydroxy analogue. The present invention further relates<br>
to a method for preparing new chelates with methionine hydroxy<br>
analogue, both in solid form with iron (II), vanadium (IV) and (V)<br>
and molybdenum (V) and (VI), and in liquid form in aqeuous solution<br>
with iron (II) and (III) and chrome (III) . Eventually, the present<br>
invention relates to the use of said new chelates, both in solid<br>
form with iron (II), vanadium (IV) and (V) and molybdenum (V) and<br>
(VI), and in liquid form in aqueous solution with iron (II) and<br>
(III) and chrome aqueous solution with iron (II) and (III) and<br>
chrome (III), in human and animal nutrition.<br>
It is known that a metal chelate is a compound originating from an<br>
organic molecule (such as an amino acid or a peptide chain or an<br>
alpha-keto acid or an alpha-hydroxy acid) and a metal ion through<br>
strong coordination bonds. Some known metal chelates are used in the<br>
field of human nutrition. Their use is due to the biological action<br>
performed by the metal element involved, as activator in several<br>
enzymatic reactions, and as regulator in various metabolic functions<br>
in all living organisms. The presence of a chelating molecule<br>
promotes the absorption, availability and use of the metal element<br>
since the latter is carried by the organic component in all areas of<br>
the organism.<br>
This results also in a strong reduction of losses of unused metals<br>
in dejections, and therefore in a significant economic saving and in<br>
an environmental advantage.<br>
The general features that should characterize a highly<br>
bioavailable metal chelate are: (a) neutrality of<br>
complex (the positive charge of metal is balanced by<br>
the negative charge of ligands; (b) absence of<br>
negative counter-ions (chlorides, sulfates); (c) low<br>
molecular weight of complex (
defined metal/chelating agent (bidentate) ratio,<br>
possibly 
Moreover, metal chelates should be obtained from<br>
simple and clean processes with high yields starting<br>
from raw materials that can be easily found. These<br>
features can be implemented by means of suitable<br>
ligands, which should be easy to deproton "and have at<br>
least two donor atoms in such a position to carry out<br>
chelation. Examples of ligands are amino acids and<br>
other organic acids suitably functionalized.<br>
As far as iron is concerned, its administration in<br>
chelated form is particularly efficient against<br>
anemia. Anemia is a pathologic status of blood due to<br>
the reduction of the number of red blood cells, to the<br>
decrease of the amount of hemoalobin or to both<br>
deficiencies. Iron is fundamental for hemoglobin since<br>
it is the center in which oxygen is fixed into heme.<br>
Classes of people who need a higher amount of iron are<br>
menstruated or pregnant women, children under two<br>
years of age, vegetarians, people suffering from<br>
hemorrhoids, people suffering from ulcers and<br>
eventually blood donors. Symptoms felt by an anemic<br>
person are weariness, a higher sensibility to cold,<br>
irritableness, loss of concentration and heart<br>
palpitations.<br>
Furthermore, iron can protect from viral or bacterial<br>
infections since it promotes the stimulation of the<br>
immune system. In addition, iron promotes the<br>
metabolism of vitamins belonging to B group.<br>
It is known that the lack of these vitamins can result<br>
in diseases such as dermatitis or even more serious<br>
diseases such as pellagra (due to the deficiency of<br>
vitamin B3) . Iron intervenes in processes of- synthesis<br>
of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Eventually, the lack<br>
of iron leads to a slow cicatrisation of wounds.<br>
A first aim of the present invention is to suggest an<br>
integrator for administration in human nutrition. Said<br>
integrator is also administered to patients suffering<br>
from a deficiency of metal oligoelements such as: Mg,<br>
Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Fe.<br>
A second aim of the present invention is to suggest an<br>
integrator for agro-zootechnical nutrition to be<br>
administered to monogastric or polygastric animals.<br>
Said integrator is also administered to monogastric or<br>
polygastric animals needing an administration of metal<br>
oligoelements such as: Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Fe<br>
with a higher bioavailability.<br>
A third aim of the present invention is to suggest a<br>
method for preparing metal chelates with methionine<br>
hydroxy analogue or one of its salts, both in solid<br>
form with iron (II), vanadium (IV) and/or vanadium (V)<br>
and molybdenum (V) and/or molybdenum (VI), and in<br>
liquid form in aqueous solution with iron (II) and<br>
(III) and chrome III), in which said metals are<br>
bonded to a bifunctional organic l.igand with a strong<br>
coordination bond so as to form a stable metal<br>
chelate.<br>
A further aim of the present invention is to suggest<br>
the use of said new chelates, both in solid form with<br>
iron (II), vanadium (IV) and/or vanadium (V) and<br>
molybdenum (V) and/or molybdenum (VI), and in liquid<br>
form in aqueous solution with iron (II) and (III) and<br>
chrome (III) , for preparing metal integrators for<br>
human and animal nutrition.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention said first<br>
and second aim are achieved by, suggesting the use of<br>
metal chelates [2:1] having the general formula (I):<br>
(CH3SCH2CH2CH (OH) COO) 2M•nH2O(I)<br>
in which the bifunctional chelating agent is 2-hydro-<br>
xy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid,<br>
known as "methionine hydroxy analogue" (MHA); M is a<br>
bivalent metal cation chosen from the group<br>
comprising: Co, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn, and n is<br>
the number of water molecules; for preparing metal<br>
integrators for treating patients suffering from a<br>
deficiency of metal oligoelements or for<br>
administration in the agro-zootechnical field to<br>
monogastric or polygastric animals. In formula (I)<br>
there are zero to twelve water molecules, preferably<br>
zero to six. For instance, zero to four. 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methylthiobutanoic acid builds with iron ion a chelate<br>
having a well defined stoichiometry, containing two<br>
molecules of chelating agent pro iron atom, in the<br>
same way as it builds chelates with bivalent metals<br>
Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu and Zn.<br>
The method for preparing:metal chelates having formula<br>
(I) was described in international patent .application<br>
PCT/IT99/00225, and consists in the direct reaction of<br>
MHA with the corresponding carbonates of bivalent<br>
metals Mg, Ca, Mn Co, Cu and Zn.<br>
In an embodiment according to the present invention<br>
the Applicant has improved a method for preparing<br>
metal chelates having formula (I), which envisages the<br>
direct reaction of-MHA and metals (II) oxides such as:<br>
Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Fe.<br>
In this new embodiment oxides of metals (II) are used<br>
instead of carbonates as described in application<br>
PCT/IT99/00225, and technical and operating conditions<br>
are unchanged with respect to those referred to in<br>
application PCT/IT99/00225, and therefore said<br>
operating conditions are regarded as contained in the<br>
present application.<br>
Advantageously, the following are used: magnesium<br>
oxide mixed with magnesium carbonate or alternatively,<br>
completely replacing magnesium carbonate, zinc oxide<br>
mixed with zinc carbonate or alternatively completely<br>
repTacin;g zinc carbonate, and calcium oxide mixed with<br>
calcium carbonate or alternatively completely<br>
replacing calcium carbonate.<br>
The Applicant has found it advantageous to use for<br>
human nutrition the following metal chelates:<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH (OH)COO)2Zn•2H2O<br>
The two water molecules are not bonded to the metal.<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH (OH)COO)2Cu<br>
It is an anhydrous complex without water molecules<br>
bonded to the metal.<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH(OH)COO)2Co•2H2O<br>
The two water molecules are complexed.<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH (OH) COO) 2Mn•2H2O.<br>
The two water molecules are complexed.<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH(OH)COO) 2Ca•2H2O<br>
The two water molecules are not bonded to the metal.<br>
- (CH3SCH2CH2CH (OH)COO)2Mg•2H2O<br>
The two water molecules are not bonded to the metal.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention said<br>
third aim is achieved by suggesting a method for<br>
preparing metal chelabes with methionine hvdroxv<br>
analogue or one of its salts, both, in solid form with<br>
iron (II), vanadium (IV) and/or vanadium (V) and<br>
molybdenum (V) and/or molybdenum (VI), and in liquid<br>
form in aqueous solution with iron (II) and (III) and<br>
chrome (III).<br>
In the case of vanadium and molybdenum the method for<br>
preparing their chelates consists in the reaction of<br>
their corresponding oxides with methionine hydroxy<br>
analoque<br>
Alternatively, in the case of vanadium and molybdenum<br>
the method for preparing their chelates consists in<br>
the reaction of their corresponding metal salts with<br>
methionine hydroxy analogue<br>
For instance, an amount of solid V2O5 or MoO3 is added<br>
with a solution of methionine hydroxy analogue at a<br>
high temperature and under stirring. A transparent<br>
solution and a solid precipitate of a vanadium or<br>
molybdenum chelate are obtained from the reaction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the Applicant has arranged<br>
in a receptacle vanadium oxide V2O5 and methionine<br>
hydroxy analogue MHA. Vanadium oxide and methionine<br>
hydroxy analogue are present in a molar ratio of 1:2<br>
to 1:8, preferably 1:4 to 1:6 (Vanadium/MHA).<br>
The receptacle is equipped with stirring means,<br>
heating means and means for reaction reflux. The<br>
reaction takes placed under mechanical stirring and<br>
under reflux for a time between 20 and 60 minutes,<br>
preferably 30 minutes. At the end of the reaction a<br>
dark green solution is obtained, from which after<br>
cooling a solid green precipitate is obtained. From<br>
the chemical and physical analysis of the precipitate<br>
the Applicant has found confirmation that it is a<br>
vanadium (IV) complex having formula VOL2, where L =<br>
deprotoned methionine hydroxy analogue.<br>
During the reaction vanadium (V) oxide reduces to<br>
vanadium (IV) .<br>
In the case of iron (II) the method of preparation<br>
takes place by reaction of sodium salt (or an alkali<br>
metal or alkaline-earth metal salt) of MHA with<br>
ferrous sulfate (or any other soluble iron (II) salt)<br>
in water environment.<br>
The molar ratio MHA/Iron (II) is of 2:1 for completing<br>
the reaction. Ferrous chelate precipitates from the<br>
reaction environment and is filtered and washed with<br>
water so as to eliminate soluble sodium sulfate which<br>
builds up.<br>
After filtration and washing the chelated product is<br>
then dried so as to reduce the amount of absorbed<br>
water. The product is a pale yellow powder, little<br>
water soluble, having formula:<br>
{CH3SCH2CH2CH(OH)COO)2Fe•2H2O.<br>
Water molecules are bonded directly to iron (TGA<br>
data) .<br>
The infrared vibrational spectrum shows the occurred<br>
chelation: as a matter of fact, the spectrum has a<br>
series of characteristic bands according to the above<br>
structure.<br>
In particular, the band due to the asymmetric<br>
stretching of carboxylic group can be observed at<br>
1,596 era-1, significantly moved to low frequencies<br>
with respect to free MHA (1,720 cm"1) as expected for<br>
deprotonation and coordination. A pure and stable<br>
product is thus obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention stable solutions<br>
of iron (III) and chrome (III) chelates with MHA can be<br>
obtained by dissolution in water environment of soluble<br>
salts of iron or chrome (III) and of MHA in a ration<br>
MHA/M(III)&gt; 2,preferably 3, and keeping pH at a suitable<br>
value so as to prevent precipitation of the corresponding<br>
hydroxides.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the Applicant has improved<br>
the preparation of a stable solution of chrome (III)<br>
in which a chrome salt, for instance chrome sulfate<br>
Cr2(SO4)3 is reacted with methionine hydroxy analogue<br>
MHA under stirring, for instance by heating, for a<br>
time between 20 and 120 minutes, preferably between 30<br>
and 60 minutes. Chrome salt and methionine hydroxy<br>
analogue are present in a molar ration of 1:2 to 1:30,<br>
preferably 1:2 to 1: 20. At the end of the reaction a<br>
solution of chrome(III) complexes with methionine<br>
hydroxy analogue is obtained.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention said fourth aim is achieved by suggesting<br>
the use of said new chelaLes, both in solid form with<br>
iron (II), vanadium (IV) and/or vanadium (V) and<br>
molybdenum (V) and/or molybdenum (VI), and in liquid<br>
form in aqueous solution with iron (II) and (III) and<br>
chrome (III), for the preparation of metal integrators<br>
for human and animal nutrition.<br>
Metal chelates described in the present invention can<br>
be used mixed one with the other in various<br>
quantitative ratios for preparing metal inteqrators.<br>
Therefore, the integrators suggested both for human<br>
and animal nutrition can contain one or more metal<br>
chelates according to the present invention.<br>
With reference to the metal chelates described above<br>
and according to the present invention the Applicant<br>
has made a series of experimental tests.<br>
In vitro tests<br>
For in vitro tests cells of human colon adenocarcinoma<br>
(CACO-2) have been used, these being the most<br>
frequently used in vitro system for studies on<br>
intestinal functionality, in particular as far as<br>
transepithelial transport is concerned, since said<br>
cells (CACO-2) develop ultra-structural, functional<br>
and electrical properties that are similar to those of<br>
small intestine.<br>
The formation of intercellular links can be monitored<br>
through measurements of transepithelial electric<br>
resistance (TEER) of the single layer of cells. Since<br>
intercellular links limit the (para-cellular) movement<br>
of solutes, TEER alterations are commonly used as<br>
permeability index of said links.<br>
The equipment used for cell growth and differentiation<br>
is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Said cells, referred to with A in Figure 1, have been<br>
grown and differentiated . on a carrier (permeable<br>
filter), referred to with B in Figure 1, until a<br>
single layer of differentiated cells joined by<br>
functional intercellular links is formed. Said filter<br>
B separates the apical environment C, (AP),<br>
(simulating intestine lumen) from the basolateral<br>
environment D, (BL), placed in the lower chamber,<br>
simulating capillary blood flow.<br>
Said cells have been treated for 3 hours with two<br>
different concentrations of Fe (III)/MHA (1:3) and<br>
Fe(III)/NTA (1:2) (nitriltriacetic acid taken as<br>
reference chelate), in a buffer solution at pH 5.5 and<br>
37°C. Said solutions have been placed in the apical<br>
compartment C (AP), whereas the basolateral<br>
compartment D (BL) dontained an iron-free solution of<br>
apotransferrin placed in a buffer solution at pH 7.4.<br>
During said experiment, at pre-established time<br>
intervals, TEER has been measured in O•cm2, Figure 2<br>
(every 30 minutes over 3 hours) and Figure 3 after 24<br>
hours.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 4, indicating the<br>
content of intracellular iron after 3 hours of<br>
treatment with Fe(III)/MHA and Fe(III)/NTA at<br>
different concentrations. Data are expressed in nimoles<br>
iron/filter.<br>
As can be inferred from Figure 4, the passage of<br>
iron/MHA chelate from the apical environment, C, to<br>
the cell is higher than the one observed in the<br>
control.<br>
Moreover, from Figure 5 (showing iron transport from<br>
apical environment C to basolateral environment D<br>
after treatment with two different concentrations of<br>
Fe(III)/MHA and Fe(III)/NTA) it can be inferred that<br>
the concentration of transported iron is comparable.<br>
Data are expressed in nmoles iron/filter.<br>
Data shown in Figure 4 and 5 confirm that iron chelate<br>
is strongly absorbed by cells of intestinal microvilli<br>
and moves within blood flow.<br>
From Figure 2 (showing TEER measurements) it can be<br>
inferred that intercellular links are unchanged, thus<br>
proving the non-toxicity of iron chelate towards<br>
cells, contrarily to what happens in the case of<br>
unchelated iron such as ferrous suifate.<br>
Figure 3 shows the measurement of TEER 24 hours after<br>
the buffer solution at 5.5 containing iron/MHA or<br>
iron/NTA has been removed keeping the cells in<br>
culture. Said Figure 3 shows how iron chelate/MHA is<br>
stable within cells causing no toxic effect.<br>
Finally, the tests show that MHA/M chelates according<br>
to the present invention are efficiently absorbed,<br>
stable within intestinal cells and non-toxic.<br>
The results shown above support the use of said new<br>
chelates, both in solid form with iron (II), vanadium<br>
(IV) and/or vanadium (V) and molybdenum (V) and/or<br>
molybdenum (VI), and in liquid form in aqueous<br>
solution with iron (II) and (III) and chrome (III),<br>
for the preparation of metal integrators for human and<br>
animal nutrition.<br>
In vivo tests<br>
Said tests have involved both monogastric animals<br>
(such as pigs) and polygastric animals (such as<br>
calves).<br>
a) Monogastric animals (piqs)<br>
Two test groups of pigs (Control and Test) of 35 days<br>
of age and weaned at 19. days, were administered a food<br>
differing only in the zinc source.<br>
Said food consisted, pro kg of food as such, of 3,500<br>
Kcal ED, 1.15 g of lysine, and a total amount of zinc<br>
element of 81 mg (81 ppm) , of which 31 mg (31 ppm)<br>
were given by raw materials, whereas 50 mg (50 ppm)<br>
were respectively in form of zinc sulfate (Control)<br>
and zinc chelate with MHA (Test) according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The two groups of animals were balanced by nest,<br>
living weight and sex and were fed for 27 days. Other<br>
4 animals were immediately sacrificed and a sampling<br>
was made of them according to the following procedure.<br>
The two groups of animals were weighed before starting<br>
the test and after 27 days. At the end of the test the<br>
pigs were sacrificed and stomach, intestine, left<br>
kidney and liver were removed from every pig. Stomach<br>
and intestine were emptied and weighed again so as to<br>
obtain the net weight of said organs. A sample of<br>
kidney, liver and brain was taken and frozen. Stomach,<br>
intestine, left kidney and liver were then put<br>
together with the remaining carcass and homogenized<br>
with a mixer. A sample was then taken from the mass<br>
thus obtained and frozen. The samples were then<br>
dehydrated with a dehydrating device and underwent<br>
chemical analysis.<br>
The level of 2inc, copper and iron were determined on<br>
the lyophilized samples by atomic absorption<br>
spectroscopy. The body levels of zinc were referred to<br>
the product.<br>
On the basis of the body"s "net" weight (i.e. without<br>
the content of the digestive tube) and of its content<br>
of zinc at test beginning and end it was possible to<br>
determine also daily zinc retention. The results of<br>
the chemical analyses carried out on the samples are<br>
shown in Table 1. The pigs were sacrificed at an<br>
average weight of 16.2 kg. The average daily weight<br>
increase was of 324 g.<br>
As can be inferred from the data shown in Table 2<br>
concerning daily zinc retention of the two different<br>
sources, the integration of zinc chelate was retained<br>
by the organism 26% more (P=0.07) than the integration<br>
with zinc sulfate. Table 3 shows the data concerning<br>
the effect of the zinc source on the content of zinc,<br>
copper and iron in liver, kidney and brain and,<br>
therefore, on the interaction with said elements<br>
present in the diet under inorganic form. As a matter<br>
of fact, it is known about the interaction exerted by<br>
said free ions by reducing one the absorption of the<br>
other.<br>
The content of said three minerals in liver was not<br>
affected by the diet and therefore by the zinc source.<br>
Average values were 296 mg/kg for zinc, 63 mg/kg for<br>
copper and 220 for iron. Conversely, kidney showed a<br>
higher content of zinc (+18%, P=0.07), of iron (+36%,<br>
P
reach only for the latter value the threshold of<br>
statistic significance, though it showed a tendency<br>
towards an increase in the retention of said metal<br>
element.<br>
In brain there was a tendency towards a higher content<br>
of zinc (+13%), of copper (+20%), of iron (+25%).<br>
The obtained results point out a higher<br>
bioavailability of the metal element in chelated form<br>
with respect to inorganic sources such as sulfates,<br>
and further a lower interaction with other ions, which<br>
results in a higher retention of the latter.<br>
As is known, pigs are one of man-closest animal models<br>
and as such they are often used as model for<br>
evaluations and studies in the human field.<br>
b) Polygastric animals (meat cattle)<br>
Two groups of female Charolaise calves (30 months old)<br>
comprising 6 animals each, with an average starting<br>
weight of 567 kg (Control and of 565 kg (Test), were<br>
fed for 90 days with the same diet The only<br>
difference was that the Control group was administered<br>
zinc carbonate and the Test group zinc chelate<br>
according to the present invention. Daily ingestion<br>
was of 22 kg/animal and the total daily supply of zinc<br>
element was of 700 mg.<br>
Living weight at test beginning and end, dead weight<br>
and slaughtering yield were determined for each<br>
animal. Data are shown in Table 4.<br>
Animals fed with zinc chelate with respect to those<br>
fed with zinc carbonate have a significantly higher<br>
final weight (652 kg vs. 642 kg, p
significantly higher daily weight increase (1,039 g<br>
vs. 934 g, p
weight (377 kg vs. 366 kg, P
significantly higher yield (57.83% vs. 57.03%,<br>
p
the presence of zinc chelate in the ratio administered<br>
to animals is shown in Table 5.<br>
Said results show an evident improvement of the<br>
aforesaid zootechnical performances of zinc chelate<br>
with respect to inorganic sources of said element.<br>
Stability constants for the various Fe/MHA complexes<br>
have been calculated with potentiometric titrations.<br>
The stability of iron (III) complexes is very high and<br>
chelated species form also at acid pH. Uncomplexed<br>
Fe3+ ions are present only at very low pH values<br>
(
complexed as chelated species metal/ligand = 1:2.<br>
