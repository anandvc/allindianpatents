				<td>ISOLATION, FORMULATION, AND SHAPING OF<br>
MACROCYCLIC OLIGOESTERS<br>
Related Applications<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/301,399, filed on June 27,2001, entitled "Melt Isolation,<br>
Solidification, and Formulation of Macrocyclic Oligoesters," which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to thermoplastics and articles formed therefrom.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to processes for isolating, formulating, and shaping<br>
macrocyclic oligoesters such as macrocyclic oligoesters of 1,4-butylene terephthalate.<br>
Background Information<br>
[0003] Linear polyesters such as poly(alkylene terephthalate) are generally known and<br>
commercially available where the alkylene typically has 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Linear polyesters<br>
have many valuable characteristics including strength, toughness, high gloss, and solvent<br>
resistance. Linear polyesters are conventionally prepared by the reaction of a diol with a<br>
dicarboxylic acid or its functional derivative, typically a diacid halide or ester. Linear polyesters<br>
may be fabricated into articles of manufacture by a number of known techniques including<br>
extrusion, compression molding, and injection molding.<br>
[0004] Recently, macrocyclic oligoesters were developed that have unique properties that<br>
make them attractive for a variety of applications, including as matrices for engineering<br>
thermoplastic composites. Macrocyclic oligoesters exhibit low melt viscosity, for example,<br>
allowing them easily to impregnate a dense fibrous preform followed by polymerization to<br>
polymers. Furthermore, certain macrocyclic oligoesters melt and polymerize at temperatures<br>
well below the melting point of the resulting polymer. Upon melting and in the presence of an<br>
appropriate catalyst, polymerization and crystallization can occur virtually isothermally.<br>
[0005] Production of macrocyclic oligoesters such as macrocyclic (1,4-butylene<br>
terephthalate) typically involves the use of one or more solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene or<br>
xylene. Some prior techniques that have been used to recover macrocyclic oligoesters dissolved<br>
in a solvent required the addition of a large amount of anti-solvent to the solutionto prepipitaje.<br>
the macrocyclic oligoester followed by collection of the product using a filter or a centrifuge.<br>
The use of anti-solvents results in increased processing complexity, costs, and creates additional<br>
environmental storage and disposal concerns.<br>
[0006}. Linear polyesters may be depolymerized to form macrocyclic oligoesters. The<br>
product solution of a depolymerization reaction may be dilute, making recovery more time<br>
consuming. Depolymerization production efforts also generally take place in stages, with each<br>
stage including a step of the process and with intermediate storage between the steps.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007] There is a need for effective, efficient, and low cost processes for isolating,<br>
formulating, and shaping macrocyclic oligoesters. There is also a need for processes that enable<br>
continuous production of macrocyclic oligoesters. In one aspect, the invention generally relates<br>
to processes for producing macrocyclic oligoesters (e.g., macrocyclic 1,4-butylene terephthalate<br>
oligomers), including processes for isolating macrocyclic oligoesters from solvents so the<br>
resulting macrocyclic oligoesters are substantially free from solvent. The invention also includes<br>
processes for formulating and shaping the substantially solvent free macrocyclic oligoesters. In<br>
some embodiments, the described processes are performed continuously, to enable continuous<br>
production in a manufacturing plant. Further, the described processes can be beneficially<br>
combined for greater efficiencies and production benefits.<br>
[0008] In one aspect, the invention features a process for isolating a macrocyclic<br>
oligoester. A solution including a macrocyclic oligoester and a solvent is provided. The<br>
macrocyclic oligoester typically has a structural repeat unit of formula (I):<br><br>
where R may be an alkylene, a cycloalkylene, or a mono- or polyoxyalkylene group, and A may<br>
be a divalent aromatic or alicyclic group. The solvent is then removed without the use of anti-<br>
solvent. In typical practice, substantially all of the solvent is removed. In one embodiment, the<br>
solvent is removed under elevated temperature conditions. -In another embodiment, the solvent is<br>
removed under reduced pressure conditions. In another embodiment, the solvent is removed<br>
under a combination of both elevated temperature and reduced pressure conditions. The<br>
macrocyclic oligoester, which is substantially free from the solvent then typically is collected. In<br>
one embodiment, the solvent is continuously removed from the solution. In another<br>
embodiment, the macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from the solvent is continuously<br>
collected.<br>
[0009] In another aspect, the invention features a process for shaping a partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. In one embodiment, this process includes providing a<br>
substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester typically having the structural repeat unit<br>
of the formula (I) described above. The substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester<br>
is sheared to form a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. The partially-crystallized<br>
macrocyclic oligoester is then shaped. In one embodiment, a continuous flow of substantially<br>
solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester is sheared continuously. In another embodiment, the<br>
step of shaping the partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester is conducted continuously.<br>
[0010] In yet another aspect, the invention features a process for making a prepreg of a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst. In one embodiment, a mixture of a molten<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst, which is substantially free from any<br>
solvent, is provided. The macrocyclic oligoester typically has the structural repeat unit of the<br>
formula (I) described above. The mixture is deposited onto a fabric material, forming a prepreg.<br>
In one embodiment, the mixture is partially-crystallized prior to being deposited onto the fabric<br>
material.<br>
[0011] In yet another aspect, the invention features a process for making a prepreg of a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst. In one embodiment, a mixture of a molten<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst, which is substantially free from any<br>
solvent, is provided continuously. The macrocyclic oligoester typically has the structural repeat<br>
unit of formula (I) described above. The mixture of the macrocyclic oligoester and the<br>
polymerization catalyst is crystallized partially and deposited onto a fabric material.<br>
[0012] In still another aspect, the invention features a process for formulating a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester. In one embodiment, a solution including a macrocyclic oligoester and a<br>
solvent is provided. The macrocyclic oligoester typically has a structural repeat unit of formula<br>
(I) described above. The solvent often is continuously removed from the solution at a<br>
temperature between about 180°C and about 200°C and at a pressure between about atmospheric<br>
pressure and about 10 torr. The step of solvent removal produces a substantially solvent-free<br>
molten macrocyclic oligoester. The substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester then<br>
is sheared at a temperature below the melting point of the molten macrocyclic oligoester. In one<br>
embodiment, the shearing temperature is maintained between about 145°C and about 155°C,<br>
thereby forming a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. The partially-crystallized<br>
macrocyclic oligoester is shaped into one or more shapes such as a pellet, a pastille, and/or a<br>
flake.<br>

Description<br>
[0023] The processes of the invention are more efficient and economical than existing<br>
techniques because the isolation, formulation, and shaping processes may be carried out<br>
continuously and on a large scale. The purity of the macrocyclic oligoester may be effectively<br>
controlled by the incorporation of multiple solvent removal apparatus where necessary. The<br>
isolation, formulation, and shaping processes also may be beneficially linked, resulting in<br>
efficient mass production and lowered manufacturing costs. Such linked processes avoid product<br>
and energy waste incurred when the isolation, formulation, and shaping processes are conducted<br>
separately. For example, macrocyclic oligoesters may be isolated in a molten state. The shaping<br>
process typically requires the macrocyclic oligoesters to be provided in a molten state.<br>
Accordingly, linking these processes reduces energy uses and increases production efficiency.<br>
[0024] For example of the benefits of continuous production, a macrocyclic oligoester<br>
having between about 80 ppm and about 400 ppm solvent may be produced at a rate of between<br>
about 40 kg/hr and about 300 kg/hr using a feed solution having 20% by weight of macrocyclic<br>
oligoester, which can be. fed at a rate of between about 200 kg/hr and about 1,500 kg/hr. For<br>
example, after solvent removal, the macrocyclic oligoester, which is substantially free from<br>
solvent, may be collected at a rate of between about 80 kg/hr to about 250 kg/hr. Pellets and<br>
pastilles of formulated and shaped macrocyclic oligoesters also can be produced at a similar rate.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0025] The following general definitions may be helpful in understanding the various<br>
terms and expressions used in mis specification.<br>
[0026] As used herein, a "macrocyclic" molecule means a cyclic molecule having at least<br>
one ring within its molecular structure that contains 8 or more atoms covalently connected to<br>
form the ring.,<br>
[0027] As used herein, an "oligomer" means a molecule that contains 2 or more<br>
identifiable structural repeat units of the same or different formula.<br>
[0028] As used herein, an "oligoester" means a molecule that contains 2 or more<br>
identifiable ester functional repeat units of the same or different formula.<br>
[0029] As used herein, a "macrocyclic oligoester" means a macrocyclic oligomer<br>
containing 2 or more identifiable ester functional repeat units of the same or different formula. A<br>
macrocyclic oligoester typically refers to multiple molecules of one specific formula having<br>
varying ring sizes. However, a macrocyclic oligoester may also include multiple molecules of<br>
different formulae having varying numbers of the same or different structural repeat units. A<br>
macrocyclic oligoester may be a co-oligoester or a higher order oligoester, i.e., an oligoester<br>
having two or more different structural repeat units having an ester functionality within one<br>
cyclic molecule.<br>
[0030J As used herein, "an alkylene group" means -CnH2n-, where n 2:2.<br>
[0031] As used herein, "a cycloalkylene group" means a cyclic alkylene group, -CnH2n..x-,<br>
where x represents the number of H's replaced by cyclization(s).<br>
[0032] As used herein, "a mono- or polyoxyalkylene group" means [-(CH2)m-O-]n-<br>
(CH2)m-, wherein m is an integer greater than 1 and n is an integer greater than 0.<br>
[0033] As used herein, "a divalent aromatic group" means an aromatic group with links<br>
to other parts of the macrocyclic molecule. For example, a divalent aromatic group may include<br>
a meta- or para- linked monocyclic aromatic group (e.g., benzene).<br>
[0034] As used herein, "an alicyclic group" means a non-aromatic hydrocarbon group<br>
containing a cyclic structure therein.<br>
[0035] As used herein, "partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligomer" means a macrocyclic<br>
oligomer at least a portion of which is in crystalline form. Partially-crystallized macrocyclic<br>
oligomer may have various degrees of crystallinity ranging from 1% crystalline to 99%<br>
crystalline. Crystallinity imparts handleablility to the macrocyclic oligomer, enabling it to be<br>
shaped, for example.<br>
[0036] As used herein, "a continuous process" means a process that operates on the basis<br>
of a continuous flow of materials into and/or materials out of the process.<br>
[0037] As used herein, "a polyester polymer composite" means a polyester polymer that<br>
is associated with another substrate such as a fibrous or particulate material. Illustrative<br>
examples of particulate material are chopped fibers, glass microspheres, and crushed stone.<br>
Certain fillers and additives thus can be used to prepare polyester polymer composites. A fibrous<br>
material means more substrate, e.g., fiberglass, ceramic fibers, carbon fibers or organic polymers<br>
such as aramid fibers.<br>
[0038] As used herein, "a fabric material" means any substrate useful in receiving<br>
macrocyclic oligoesters during production and formulation processes and in preparing prepregs<br>
of macrocyclic oligomers. Typically, fabric materials include fiber tow, fiber web, fiber mat, and<br>
fiber felt. The fabric materials may be woven or non-woven, unidirectional, or random.<br>
Macrocyclic Oligoesters<br>
[0039] Macrocyclic oligoesters that may be processed according to processes of this<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, macrocyclic poly(alkylene dicarboxylate) oligomers<br>
typically having a structural repeat unit of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R is an alkylene, a cycloalkylene, or a mono- or polyoxyalkylene group; and A is a<br>
divalent aromatic or alicyclic group.<br>
[0040] Preferred macrocyclic oligoesters are macrocyclic oligoesters of 1,4-butylene<br>
terephthalate, 1,3-propylene terephthalate, 1,4-cyclohexylenedimethyleneterephthalate, ethylene<br>
terephthalate, propylene terephthalate, and 1,2-ethylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate, and<br>
macrocyclic co-oligoesters comprising two or more of the above structural repeat units.<br>
[0041] Synthesis of the macrocyclic oligoesters may be achieved by contacting at least<br>
one diol of the formula HO-R-OH with at least one diacid chloride of the formula:<br><br>
where R and A are as defined above. The reaction typically is conducted in the presence of at<br>
least one amine that has substantially no steric hindrance around the basic nitrogen atom. An<br>
illustrative example of such amines is l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). The reaction<br>
usually is conducted under substantially anhydrous conditions in a substantially water immiscible<br>
organic solvent such as methylene chloride. The temperature of the reaction typically is within<br>
the range of from about -25°C to about 25°C. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,039,783 to Brunelle et<br>
al.<br>
[0042] Macrocyclic oligoesters also can be prepared via the condensation of a diacid<br>
chloride with at least one bis(hydroxyalkyl) ester such as bis(4-hydroxybutyl) terephthalate in the<br>
presence of a highly unhindered amine or a mixture thereof with at least one other tertiary amine<br>
such as triethylamine. The condensation reaction is conducted in a substantially inert organic<br>
solvent such as methylene chloride, chlorobenzene, or a mixture thereof. See, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,231,161 to Brunelle et al.<br>
[0043] Another method for preparing macrocyclic oligoesters or macrocyclic co-<br>
oligoesters is the depolymerization of linear polyester polymers in the presence of an organotin<br>
or titanate compound. In this method, linear polyesters are converted to macrocyclic oligoesters<br>
by heating a mixture of linear polyesters, an organic solvent, and a transesteriflcation catalyst<br>
such as a tin or titanium compound. The solvents used, such as o-xylene and o-dichlorobenzene,<br>
usually are substantially free from oxygen and water. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,407,984 to<br>
Brunelle et al. and 5,668,186 to Brunelle et al.<br>
[0044] It is also within the scope of the invention to process macrocyclic co- and higher<br>
order oligoesters using the methods of the invention. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, an<br>
embodiment of a composition, article, or process that refers to macrocyclic oligoesters also<br>
includes embodiments utilizing macrocyclic co-oligoesters and higher order oligoesters.<br>
Isolation of Macrocyclic Oligoesters<br>
[0045] In one aspect, the invention generally features processes for isolating a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester from a solution having a macrocyclic oligoester and a solvent in a manner<br>
that does not require use of an anti-solvent In one embodiment, the process includes removing<br>
solvent to yield a macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent. A solution including a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a solvent is provided. The solvent is then removed without the use of<br>
anti-solvent. In one embodiment, the solvent is removed under reduced temperature conditions.<br>
In another embodiment, the solvent is removed under elevated pressure conditions. In another<br>
embodiment, the solvent is removed under a combination of both elevated temperature and<br>
reduced pressure conditions. The macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from the solvent then<br>
typically is collected. In one embodiment, the solvent is continuously removed from the solution<br>
including a macrocyclic oligoester and a solvent. In another embodiment, the macrocyclic<br>
oligoester substantially free from the solvent is continuously collected.<br>
[0046] There is no limitation to the concentration of macrocyclic oligoester in the<br>
solution. In one embodiment, the solution of a macrocyclic oligoester and a solvent (the input or<br>
feed solution) contains between about 1% and about 50% by weight macrocyclic oligoester. In<br>
other embodiments, the feed solution contains between about 3% and about 50%, between about<br>
5% and about 40%, between about 5% and about 20%, between about 3% and about 10%, or<br>
between about 1% to about 3% by weight macrocyclic oligoester. The solution may contain one<br>
or two or more different solvents. "Solvent" used herein refers to the solvent or solvents<br>
contained in the feed solution.<br>
[0047] Solvent removal may be carried out at an elevated temperature, at a reduced<br>
pressure, or both. In one embodiment, the feed solution is heated at an elevated temperature and<br>
a reduced pressure to remove the solvent from the solution. The resulting macrocyclic oligoester<br>
is substantially free from solvent. A macrocyclic oligoester is substantially free from solvent if<br>
the solvent content is less than 200 ppm. Preferably, the solvent content is less than 100 ppm.<br>
More preferably the solvent content is less than 50 ppm or less than 10 ppm.<br>
[0048] The processing temperature and pressure for solvent removal are selected<br>
according to factors including the solvent to be removed, the solvent removal device(s) used, the<br>
desired time of purification, and the macrocyclic oligoester being isolated. In one embodiment,<br>
the step of removing solvent is conducted at a temperature within a range from ambient<br>
temperature to about 300°C. In other embodiments, the step of removing solvent is conducted<br>
from about 200°C to about 260°C, from about 230°C to about 240°C, or from about 180°C to<br>
about200°C.<br>
[0049] The pressure at which solvent removal is conducted can vary from atmospheric<br>
pressure to about 0.001 torr. In one embodiment, the pressure is within a range from 0.001 torr<br>
to about 0.01 torr. In other embodiments, the pressure is within a range from atmospheric<br>
pressure to about 10 torr, from about 10 torr to about 5.0 torr, from about 5.0 torr to about 1.0<br>
torr, from about 1.0 torr to about 0.1 torr, or from about 0.1 torr to about 0.01 torr.<br>
[0050] Solvent removal may be accomplished in almost any apparatus, e.g., vessels or<br>
devices or a combination of apparatus. Non-limiting examples of solvent removal apparatus that<br>
may be employed include a rising film evaporator, a falling film stripper, a thin film evaporator,<br>
a wiped film evaporator, a molecular still, a short path evaporator, a centrifuge, and a filter. The<br>
terms evaporator and stripper may be used interchangeably. In one embodiment, the rising film<br>
evaporator may be a tubular heat exchanger. A rising film evaporator is an apparatus used to<br>
vaporize part or all of the solvent from a solution where the solution is introduced to the bottom<br>
of the evaporator. A falling film stripper is an evaporative device for the removal of vapors from<br>
solution, where the solution is introduced to the top of the apparatus and travels to the bottom of<br>
the apparatus. A thin film evaporator is an apparatus that generates and exposes a thin film of<br>
material for evaporation and has the vapor condenser outside of the evaporator. A wiped film<br>
evaporator is an apparatus that generates and exposes a thin film of material to wiping or<br>
agitation to provide evaporation. A short path evaporator generates and exposes a thin film of<br>
material for evaporation and has the vapor condenser inside the evaporator. In some<br>
embodiments, the short path evaporator exposes the thin film to wiping or agitation to provide<br>
evaporation. A molecular still is an apparatus that utilizes a condenser inside the body of the<br>
still. One or more solvent removal device may be employed in accordance with the invention. In<br>
one embodiment, each solvent removal apparatus used in the process removes between about<br>
80% and about 90% of the solvent. In one embodiment, multiple solvent removal apparatus are<br>
employed to achieve the desired dryness in the macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from<br>
solvent.<br>
[0051] FIG. 1 schematically illustrates one embodiment of a solvent removal system 2.<br>
An input solution 10 is pumped into a rising film evaporator 11. As the input solution travels up<br>
the first rising film evaporator 11, some of the solvent vaporizes and is separated from the<br>
solution. This solution and the vapor then travels through a flash device 15. A flash device is an<br>
apparatus that is used to separate the liquid and the gas phase. The liquid phase solution then is<br>
pumped into a second rising film evaporator 21. After traveling through another flash device 25,<br>
the vapor phase solvent that is removed from flash devices 15 and 25 is pumped through paths<br>
20' and 20", respectively, and is condensed in condensers 52 and 54. The condensers 52 and 54<br>
change any vapor phase solvent in paths 20' and 20" into a liquid phase. Optionally, effluent<br>
containing removed solvent may be discharged from condensers 52 and 54. The condensed<br>
solvent is then collected in the liquid receiver 27. The solution containing macrocyclic oligoester<br>
is pumped from flash device 25 into a falling film stripper 31. In one embodiment, the vapors<br>
removed in the falling film stripper 31 also travel through the flash device 25. An output product<br>
130, which is substantially free from solvent, is pumped out of the falling film stripper 31. In<br>
one embodiment, the output product 130 is molten.<br>
[0052] Substantially all of the solvent in the input solution can be removed from the<br>
macrocyclic oligoester to form a macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent. In one<br>
embodiment, the macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent may contain about 200<br>
ppm or less of solvent. In other embodiments, the macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from<br>
solvent may contain about 100 ppm or less of solvent, about 50 ppm or less of solvent, and about<br>
10 ppm or less of solvent. The amount of solvent remaining in the macrocyclic oligoester<br>
substantially free from solvent may be measured using chromatographic techniques such as gas<br>
chromatography, GCMS, or HPLC.<br>
[0053] In determining an appropriate solvent stripping system to employ in a particular<br>
process, factors that need to be considered include the concentration of macrocyclic oligoester in<br>
the feed solution, the desired dryness and/or purity of the product, the solvent to be removed, and<br>
the desired length of time for solvent removal. For example, starting with a relatively dilute feed<br>
solution (i.e., low percentage of macrocyclic oligoester), more solvent removal steps and/or time<br>
may be necessary to produce a substantially solvent free macrocyclic oligoester. Conversely, a<br>
concentrated feed solution of macrocyclic oligoester may require fewer solvent removal steps<br>
and/or time.<br>
[0054] Generally and in one embodiment, solvent is removed from an input solution by<br>
exposing the input solution to an elevated temperature and a reduced pressure in a first rising<br>
film evaporator. The input solution then travels to a second rising film evaporator where it is<br>
exposed to an elevated temperature and a reduced pressure. Finally, the input solution travels to<br>
a falling film stripper and a macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent is collected<br>
from the falling film stripper.<br>
[0055] In another general embodiment, solvent is removed from an input solution by<br>
exposing the feed solution to an elevated temperature and a reduced pressure in a first rising film<br>
evaporator. The input solution then travels through a first flash device. The solvent that is<br>
removed in the first rising film evaporator and the first flash device travels to a first condenser<br>
and the remainder of the input solution travels to a second rising film evaporator where it is<br>
exposed to an elevated temperature and a reduced pressure. The input solution then travels<br>
through a second flash device. The solvent that is removed in the second rising film evaporator<br>
and the second flash device travels to a second condenser. The solvent that has traveled through<br>
the first condenser and the second condenser is transported to a liquid receiver. The remainder of<br>
the input solution and the solvent travels to a falling film stripper. Optionally, the sparger may<br>
operate at the same time as the falling film stripper. Alternatively, a sparger removes gasses and<br>
vapors from the input solution after it has traveled through the stripper. Thereafter, a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent is collected.<br>
[0056] When preparing macrocyclic oligoesters by depolymerizing linear polyesters,<br>
dilute conditions may be desired to promote cyclization and to increase the yield of macrocylcic<br>
oligoesters. As a result, the macrocyclic oligoester solution (e.g., the product solution of a<br>
depolymerization reaction) may be dilute (e.g., a 1% by weight macrocyclic oligoester solution).<br>
[0057] FIG. 2 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a system 1 for solvent removal<br>
that is typically employed where the solution is dilute (e.g., less than about 3% by weight<br>
macrocyclic oligoester). A linear polyester depolymerization reaction product solution (i.e., the<br>
input solution) 110 is pumped into a rising film evaporator 111. Some of the solvent in the<br>
solution transitions into the vapor phase as it travels up the rising film evaporator 111 and it then<br>
travels though a flash device 115. The solution then is pumped into a second rising film<br>
evaporator 121. Thereafter the solution travels through another flash device 125. The solution<br>
that exits the flash device 125 travels along path 135 and has a higher macrocyclic oligoester<br>
concentration (e.g., an increase from about 1% to about 3%). The vapor phase solvent that is<br>
removed from flash devices 115 and 125 travels along paths 120' and 120", is condensed in<br>
condensers 152 and 154, and is collected in a liquid receiver 127. The macrocyclic oligoester<br>
solution that exits the flash device 125 then travels along path 135 to a filter 141, which removes<br>
any remaining linear polyester and/or catalyst from the depolymerization reaction product<br>
solution. The filter 141 may be, for example, a Niagara filter or a Sparkler filter. A Niagara<br>
filter is a multiple tray filter available from Baker Hughes Corporation (Houston, TX). Similarly,<br>
a Sparkler filter is a multiple tray filter apparatus available from Sparkler Filters, Inc. (Conroe,<br>
TX). In one embodiment, a centrifuge is employed alternatively or in addition to the filter 141.<br>
A resulting output solution 190 exiting filter 141 may become the input solution in the next<br>
solvent removal step.<br>
[0058] The output solution 190 may have a macrocyclic oliogester concentration of about<br>
3%. In one embodiment, the rising film evaporator 111 is held at a temperature between about<br>
180°C-185°C at atmospheric pressure. In another embodiment, the rising film evaporator 121 is<br>
held at temperature between about 180°C-185°C at atmospheric pressure. In other embodiments,<br>
each rising film evaporator 111 and 121 is held at a temperature between about 120°C to 280°C<br>
at a pressure ranging from about 0.001 torr to about atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0059] Referring again to FIG. 1, when the concentration of macrocyclic oligomer input<br>
solution 10 is about 3%, two additional rising film evaporators (not shown) may be placed in<br>
series between the first rising film evaporator 11 and the second rising film evaporator 21. The<br>
two additional rising film evaporators may employ similar conditions as the first rising film<br>
evaporator 11 and use steam to heat the macrocyclic oligomer and the solvent (e.g., at about<br>
150°C under a pressure of about 100 torr).<br>
[0060] In one embodiment, the rising film evaporator employs steam to heat the solution<br>
to a temperature between about 120°C to 200°C. In yet another embodiment, the rising film<br>
evaporator employs hot oil to heat the solution to between about 200°C to about 280°C. The<br>
rising film evaporators may be operated at pressures ranging from about 0.001 torr to about<br>
atmospheric pressure. In one embodiment, between about 80% and about 90% of the solvent in<br>
the input solution is removed by each rising film evaporator. Where the input solution has a<br>
relatively low concentration of macrocyclic oligoester, multiple rising film evaporators may be<br>
employed in multiple steps. In one embodiment, multiple solvent removal apparatus are<br>
employed to achieve the desired dryness in the macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from<br>
solvent.<br>
[0061} FIG. 3 schematically illustrates another embodiment of a solvent removal system<br>
3. The system shown in FIG. 3 may be used alone or in combination with that of FIG. 2. An<br>
input solution 210 is pumped into a first rising film evaporator 211. Thereafter, the solution<br>
travels through a first flash device 255. Condenser 252 captures the vaporized solvent that is<br>
removed in the first rising film evaporator 211 and the first flash device 255. The solution then<br>
travels through a second rising film evaporator 221 to a second flash device 265. Condenser 254<br>
captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the second rising film evaporator 221 and the<br>
second flash device 265. The solution then travels through a third rising film evaporator 231.<br>
Subsequently, the solution travels through a third flash device 275. Condenser 256 captures the<br>
vaporized solvent that is removed in the third rising film evaporator 231 and the third flash<br>
device 275. After traveling through the third flash device 275, the solution travels through the<br>
falling film stripper 241. A macrocyclic oligoester output product 230 substantially free from<br>
solvent is pumped out of the falling film stripper 241. In one embodiment, the macrocyclic<br>
oligoester 230 is in a molten state. The vaporized solvent that is removed from flash device 255,<br>
265, and 275 travels along paths 220', 220", and 220'" and is condensed in condensers 252,254<br>
and 256, and is collected in the liquid receiver 227.<br>
[0062] In another embodiment, the first rising film evaporator has about 20 square feet of<br>
evaporation surface area and is maintained at about atmospheric pressure and a temperature of<br>
about 185°C. The second rising film evaporator has about 5 square feet of evaporation surface<br>
area and is maintained at a pressure of about 1 torr and at a temperature ranging between about<br>
185°C and about 190°C. The third rising film evaporator has about 1 square foot of evaporation<br>
surface area and is maintained at a pressure of about 1 torr and at a temperature ranging between<br>
about 185°C and about 190°C. In this embodiment, the first rising film evaporator, having a<br>
relatively large evaporation surface area and being run at atmospheric pressure, typically removes<br>
the bulk of solvent from the input solution.<br>
[0063] Generally and in one embodiment of the invention, solvent is removed from an<br>
input solution of a macrocyclic oligoester by exposing the input solution to an elevated<br>
temperature and a reduced pressure in a first short path evaporator. A short path evaporator is<br>
used to vaporize part or all of the solvent from a solution. A short path evaporator can operate at<br>
a low pressure because the condenser is located inside of the evaporator. The input solution may<br>
then travel to a second short path evaporator where it is exposed to an elevated temperature and a<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
[0064] FIG. 4 schematically illustrates another embodiment of a solvent removal system<br>
4. An input solution 310 of a 3% by weight macrocyclic oligoester solution is pumped into the<br>
top of a falling film stripper 341. Thereafter, the solution travels through a flash device 315.<br>
The solvent that is vaporized in the falling film stripper 341 and the first flash device 315 travels<br>
through a path 320' to a condenser 352, and is removed from the solution. The solvent that has<br>
traveled through the condenser 352 is transported to a liquid receiver 327. The solution travels to<br>
the short path evaporator 311. In the short path evaporator 311 the solution is exposed to an<br>
elevated temperature and reduced pressure. The solvent that is vaporized in the short path<br>
evaporator 311 is condensed within the short path evaporator 311 and removed from the solution.<br>
The solvent removed within the short path evaporator 311 is transported through a path 320" to a<br>
liquid receiver 327. A macrocyclic oligoester output product 330 substantially free from solvent<br>
exits the short path evaporator 311. In one embodiment, the macrocyclic oligoester 330 is in a<br>
molten state. A macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from solvent is collected from the short<br>
path evaporator 311.<br>
[0065] In one exemplary embodiment the input solution 310 of macrocyclic oligoester is<br>
heated to a temperature of about 180°C and is pumped into the top of the falling film stripper 341<br>
at a rate of about 5900 kg/hr. The falling film stripper 341 is maintained at a temperature of<br>
about 180°C and at about atmospheric pressure. The solution exits the bottom of the falling film<br>
stripper 341 at a temperature of about 180°C. The solution enters the flash device 315, which is<br>
held at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about 180°C. The solution exiting the flash<br>
device 315 that enters the short path evaporator 311 is at a temperature of about 180°C. The<br>
short path evaporator 311 has 2.4 m2 of surface area, is held at a temperature of about 210°C and<br>
at a pressure of about 5 torr. The macrocyclic oligoester output product 330 exits the short path<br>
evaporator 311 at a rate of about 181 kg/hr and at a temperature of about 210°C. The output<br>
product 330 contains less than 100 ppm of solvent. A suitable falling film stripper 341, flash<br>
device 315, and short path evaporator 311 that may be employed in accordance with this<br>
exemplary embodiment are available from Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL).<br>
[0066] In one embodiment, a compressor may be employed in place of a condenser. In<br>
another embodiment, the compressed gas or the condensed gas exiting the compressor or the<br>
condenser, respectively, may be employed as the heat input to one or more of the stripping<br>
apparatus and/or the evaporating apparatus. For example, where a shell and tube heat exchanger<br>
is employed, the compressed gas exiting a compressor may be fed to the shell side of the heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
[0067] Generally, where short path evaporators have been employed in the solvent<br>
removal process, a sparger may not be necessary to obtain a macrocyclic oligoester substantially<br>
free from solvent. Short path evaporators can operate effectively under lower vacuum and at<br>
lower temperature conditions, thereby potentially saving energy costs. Also, the time required by<br>
the sparging step and the cost of maintaining sparging equipment are avoided when short path<br>
evaporators are employed.<br>
[0068] Systems, apparatus, and equipment that may be employed or adapted to perform<br>
the processes described herein are commercially available, for example, from Artisan Industries<br>
Inc. of Waltham, MA and from LCI of Charlotte, NC. Suitable rising film evaporators include<br>
heat exchangers available from Troy Boiler (Albany, NY). Suitable falling film strippers,<br>
condensers and flash devices may be supplied by Artisan Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA) and<br>
Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL). Suitable short path evaporators are available from<br>
Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL). Suitable liquid receivers are available from suppliers<br>
including, Artisan Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA)and Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL)<br>
Shaping Macrocyclic Oligoesters<br>
[0069] In another aspect, the invention features a process for shaping a partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. This process includes providing a substantially solvent-free<br>
molten macrocyclic oligoester. The substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester is<br>
sheared to form a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester, which can be shaped.<br>
[0070] In one embodiment, the substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester is<br>
continuously sheared to form a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. In another<br>
embodiment, shaping of the partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester is continuous. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the molten macrocyclic oligoester is continuously sheared and the partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligoester is continuously shaped.<br>
[0071] Once substantially free from solvent, the macrocyclic oligoester, which may be a<br>
molten liquid at the solvent-removal temperature, is cooled and solidified into a usable form.<br>
When molten macrocyclic oligoester (such as macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate)) is cooled<br>
quickly, it is typically amorphous. In its amorphous state, the macrocyclic oligoester is sticky<br>
and "droplets" tend to agglomerate into a large mass. Amorphous macrocyclic oligoester also<br>
absorbs water from the atmosphere, which can be detrimental to subsequent processing.<br>
[00721 Shear-induced partial-crystallization is used to facilitate crystallization of the<br>
macrocyclic oligoester. According to embodiments of the invention, an extruder, a scraped<br>
surface crystallizer, and/or a shear mixer are employed to partially-crystallize the product to form<br>
a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. A shear mixer includes any crystallizer that<br>
facilities crystallization by shear mixing. The extruder may be employed to extrude the<br>
macrocyclic oligoester at a temperature below the melting point of the macrocyclic oligoester,<br>
thereby forming a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. Shearing may include shearing,<br>
cooling, or shearing and cooling simultaneously.<br>
[0073] Suitable product forms (e.g., pellets, pastilles, flakes, and prepregs) that are stable<br>
in the environment and easy to handle may be obtained by these methods. The partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligoester then may be collected. The collection may be continuously<br>
performed depending on the application.<br>
[0074] Two or more processes of the invention may be carried out simultaneously. In<br>
one embodiment, an extruder removes solvent from the solution of macrocyclic oligoester to<br>
form a substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester that the extruder shears to form a<br>
partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester that is shaped into a pellet.<br>
[0075] The macrocyclic oligoester may be sheared at a temperature that is lower than the<br>
melting point of the macrocyclic oligoester. In one embodiment, the shearing step is conducted<br>
at a temperature between about 100°C and about 165°C. In another embodiment, the shearing<br>
step is conducted at a temperature between about 145°C and about 155°C.<br>
[0076] Additionally, one or more of various additives and fillers can be incorporated into<br>
the macrocyclic oligoester, before, during or after solvent removal to yield a fully formulated<br>
product. For example, in the manufacture of an article, various types of fillers may be included.<br>
Filler often is included to achieve a desired property, and may be present in the resulting<br>
polyester polymer. The filler may be present to provide stability, such as chemical, thermal or<br>
light stability, to the blend material or the polyester polymer product, and/or to increase the<br>
strength of the polyester polymer product. A filler also may provide or reduce color, provide<br>
weight or bulk to achieve a particular density, provide flame resistance (i.e., be a flame<br>
retardant), be a substitute for a more expensive material, facilitate processing, and/or provide<br>
other desirable properties as recognized by a skilled artisan.<br>
[0077] Illustrative examples of fillers are, among others, fumed silicate, titanium dioxide,<br>
calcium carbonate, chopped fibers, fly ash, glass microspheres, micro-balloons, crushed stone,<br>
nanoclay, linear polymers, and monomers. One or more fillers may be added before, during, or<br>
after the polymerization reaction between a macrocyclic oligoester and a cyclic ester. For<br>
example, fillers may be added to a substantially solvent-free macrocyclic oligoester. Optionally<br>
the filler may be added when the substantially solvent-free macrocyclic oligoester is in molten<br>
form. Also, fillers can be used to prepare polyester polymer composites.<br>
[0078] In some embodiments, additional components (e.g., additives) are added to the<br>
macrocyclic oligoesters. Illustrative additives include colorants, pigments, magnetic materials,<br>
anti-oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, fire-retardants, lubricants, and mold releases. In other<br>
embodiments, one or more catalysts are added to the macrocyclic oligoester. Exemplary<br>
catalysts that may employed in accordance with the invention are described below.<br>
Formulating Macrocyclic Oligoesters<br>
[0079] In another aspect, the invention features processes for formulating macrocyclic<br>
oligoesters and processes for making prepregs from macrocyclic oligoesters and polymerization<br>
catalysts.<br>
[0080] In one embodiment, a mixture of a molten macrocyclic oligoester and a<br>
polymerization catalyst substantially free from solvent is provided. The mixture of the molten<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst is deposited onto a fabric material to form a<br>
prepreg. In one embodiment, the molten macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst are<br>
partially-crystallized prior to being deposited onto the fabric material.<br>
[0081] A mixture of a molten macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst<br>
substantially free from solvent may be continuously provided. The mixture of the macrocyclic<br>
oligoester and the polymerization catalyst may be partially crystallized. In one embodiment, the<br>
mixture is continuously partially crystallized. The partially-crystallized mixture of the<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and the polymerization catalyst then may be deposited onto a fabric<br>
material. In another embodiment, the partially-crystallized mixture is continuously deposited<br>
onto a fabric material.<br>
{0082] In other embodiments, a macrocyclic oligoester (e.g., pellets) is fed to a hot<br>
mixing device (e.g., an extruder or a Readco mixer) with other solid or liquid additives (e.g.,<br>
stabilizers or polymerization catalysts) with or without fillers. The mixing device partially melts<br>
the macrocyclic oligoester into a paste to enhance mixing and flow. The formulated product,<br>
which remains partially crystalline, then is formed into shapes such as pellets, flakes, pastilles,<br>
and/or applied directly to a fabric material to make a prepreg. This method typically avoids the<br>
problems of handling amorphous macrocyclic oligoester.<br>
[0083] In yet other embodiments, the partially-crystallized mixture of molten macrocyclic<br>
oligoester and polymerization catalyst is deposited onto a fabric material. In certain<br>
embodiments the molten macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst are shear mixed in a<br>
shear mixer; alternatively, they may be processed in an extruder. The shear-mixing may be<br>
conducted at a temperature between about 145°C and about 155°C. The fabric material(s) may<br>
be selected from the group of fiber tow, fiber web, fiber mat, felt, non-woven material, and<br>
random and woven material.<br>
[0084] Prior to partial-crystallization, the molten macrocyclic oligoester may contain less<br>
than about 200 ppm of solvent. Preferably, the molten macrocyclic oligoester contains less than<br>
about 100 ppm of solvent. More preferably, the molten macrocyclic oligoester contains less than<br>
about 50 ppm of solvent or less than about 10 ppm of solvent.<br>
[0085] The partially-crystallized mixture of the macrocyclic oligoester and the<br>
polymerization catalyst may be deposited onto the fabric material in a pre-selected array. In<br>
addition, the fabric material having the mixture of macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization<br>
catalyst deposited thereon may be formed into a desired shape, for example, an autobody panel<br>
shape. One or more additives may be added to the molten macrocyclic oligoester. Exemplary<br>
additives may be selected from the group of colorants, pigments, magnetic materials, anti-<br>
oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, fire-retardants, lubricants, and mold releases.<br>
[0086] In one embodiment, the molten macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization<br>
catalyst are partially-crystallized prior to being deposited onto the fabric material. The mixture<br>
of molton macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst may be partially-crystallized by, for<br>
example, shear mixing. In certain embodiments, shear mixing is conducted within a temperature<br>
range between about 145°C and about 155°C. m other embodiments the mixture of molton<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst is partially-crystallized by extrusion, which is<br>
often conducted within a temperature range between about 145°C and about 155°C.<br>
[0087] The partially-crystallized mixture of macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization<br>
catalyst may be deposited onto the fabric material in discrete droplets of a selected size according<br>
to a pattern of a pre-selected array. In certain embodiments, the molten macrocyclic oligoester is<br>
mixed with one or more additive(s) and/or filler(s). The fabric material may be selected from the<br>
group of fiber tow, fiber web, fiber mat, felt, non-woven material, random, and woven material.<br>
The fabric material employed in a prepreg may vary depending on the end use application of the<br>
prepreg. Also, the fiber used to make the fiber material, or any fiber sizing agents or other agents<br>
present on the fiber material, may impact the suitability of the fiber material for use in a prepreg.<br>
For example, some catalysts and/or macrocyclic oligoester and polymerization catalyst mixtures<br>
may interact with the fibers and/or any sizing or other agents that are present on the fabric<br>
material.<br>
[0088] In some embodiments, the partial crystallization step occurs continuously, hi<br>
other embodiments, the partially-crystallized mixture of macrocyclic oligoester and the<br>
polymerization catalyst is continuously deposited on the fabric material. In still other<br>
embodiments, the process of making the prepreg is continuous whereby the mixture of a molten<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and a polymerization catalyst, which is substantially free from solvent, is<br>
continuously provided, continuously partially-crystallized, then continuously deposited onto a<br>
fabric material.<br>
[0089] In another embodiments, the process of solvent removal and the process of<br>
prepreg formation are combined, creating a continuous process from the feed solution of a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester to formation of prepregs of macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from<br>
the solvent. The prepregs may contain one or more additives and a polymerization catalyst.<br>
Such continuous processes may provide advantages in many aspects such as in reducing energy<br>
cost and processing time and optimizing equipment usage.<br>
[0090] FIG. 5 schematically illustrates one embodiment of a process 5 for making pellets<br>
from a molten product with an underwater pelletizer. In this embodiment, a molten macrocyclic<br>
oligoester 530, which is substantially free from solvent, is fed into a shear mixer 360. The shear<br>
mixer 360 is connected to a temperature control loop (not shown). The shear mixer 360 may be<br>
a Readco mixer (York, PA), which is like a twin screw extruder, but less heavy duty. The molten<br>
macrocyclic oligoester within the shear mixer 360 is typically cooled to a temperature between<br>
about 80°C and about 140°C, preferably between about 130°C and about 140°C. By lowering the<br>
temperature in the shear mixer 360, the macrocyclic oligomer is crystallized partially and is<br>
paste-like. Generally, the partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligomer employed to make pellets<br>
435 measures between about 3000 cp. (centipoise) and about 5000 cp., which typically indicates<br>
that about 30% of the macrocyclic oligomer is crystallized.<br>
[0091] The partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligomer travels from the shear mixer 360<br>
to a diverter valve 365. The diverter valve 365 may be used to divert the product from the<br>
process to, for example, a bucket when the pelletizer starts up. The diverter 365 typically is used<br>
to ensure that the partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester is traveling to the upstream cutter<br>
370 at a minimum velocity. A suitable diverter 365 and a suitable cutter 370 may be available<br>
from Gala Industries (Eagle Rock, VA), Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL), and/or<br>
Artisan Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA). After a minimum velocity is achieved, the partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligomer travels to the cutter 370. At the cutter 370, the partially-<br>
crystallized paste-like macrocyclic oligomer is cut into the shape of pellets in a slurry of water.<br>
One or more pellets may be cut by the cutter 370 at once. The pellets are then removed from the<br>
slurry of water into a separator 380. The separator 380 may be a screen, which may be a moving<br>
belt. A suitable separator 380 may be available from Gala Industries (Eagle Rock, VA), Incon<br>
Processing Technology (Batavia, IL), and/or Artisan Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA).<br>
Subsequently, the pellets 435 are dried in a dryer 385 and then transferred to a pellet hopper 395<br>
and a packager 550. The dryer 385 may be a fluid bed dryer available from Kason Corporation<br>
(Milburn, NJ). A suitable pellet hopper 395 and a suitable packager 550 may be available from<br>
Gala Industries (Eagle Rock, VA), Incon Processing Technology (Batavia, IL), and/or Artisan<br>
Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA). As depicted, the water that was separated from the pellets is<br>
recycled through a sump 384 and a water circulation pump 388. A suitable sump 384 and a<br>
suitable circulation pump 388 may be available from Gala Industries (Eagle Rock, VA), Incon<br>
Processing Technology (Batavia, IL), and/or Artisan Industries Inc. (Waltham, MA).<br>
[0092] FIG. 6 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a process 6 for making either<br>
prepreg or pastille from a molten product utilizing a pastillation process. A molten macrocyclic<br>
oligoester 630, which is substantially free from solvent, is fed into a shear mixer 360 that is<br>
connected to a temperature control loop (not shown) to control the temperature of the shear<br>
mixer 360. The molten macrocyclic oligomer within the shear mixer 360 is typically cooled to a<br>
temperature between about 80°C and about 140°C, preferably between about 130°C and about<br>
140°C.<br>
[0093] In certain embodiments, the temperature control loop maintains the shear mixer<br>
360 at a temperature of about 100°C. In other embodiments, the shear mixer 360 is an extruder.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the shear mixer 360 is a Readco mixer (York, PA), which is like, a<br>
twin screw extruder, but less heavy duty.<br>
[0094] By lowering the temperature in the shear mixer, the macrocyclic oligomer is<br>
partially crystallized and becomes paste-like. The temperature and/or the level of shear provided<br>
to produce the paste-like macrocyclic oligomer varies according to the composition of the<br>
macrocyclic oligomer, including the presence of any additives. Generally, the partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligomer employed to make pastilles measures between about 500 cp.<br>
and about 1000 cp., which typically indicates that it is between about 15% and about 20%<br>
crystallized. The molten macrocyclic oligomer may contain some residual solvent (e.g., between<br>
about 100 ppm and about 10 ppm) as the molten resin enters the shaping process at a temperature<br>
between about 150°C and about 200°C.<br>
[0095] Both prepregs and pastilles can be made from the partially-crystallized and paste-<br>
like macrocyclic oligomer utilizing pastillation equipment. The partially-crystallized paste-like<br>
macrocyclic oligomer travels from the shear mixer 360 and enters a droplet generator 390. The<br>
droplet generator 390 is employed to make desired sized droplets of macrocyclic oligoester. In<br>
one embodiment, a Sandvik Rotoformer available from Sandvik Process Systems of Totowa, NJ<br>
is employed to make droplets. When pastilles 425 are manufactured, the droplet generator 390<br>
may drop pastilles 325 directly onto a moving belt 500.<br>
[0096] The moving belt 500 may be of any length and size and is typically between about<br>
50 feet to about 100 feet in length. The bottom side of the moving belt 500 may be cooled, for<br>
example, by providing water underneath the moving belt 500. The length of the moving belt 500<br>
and the cooling method can be selected to cool the pastilles 425 before the end of the moving belt<br>
500. In some embodiments, a scraping bar (not shown) is employed at the end of the moving<br>
belt 500 to remove the pastilles 425 from the moving belt 500. In one embodiment, a moving<br>
belt 500 available from Sandvik Process Systems of Totowa, NJ is employed.<br>
[0097] When a prepreg 445 is manufactured, the droplet generator 390 may drop the<br>
material 415 (e.g., macrocyclic oligoester plus a polymerization catalyst) onto a fabric material<br>
600 that is fed onto the moving belt 500. The length of the moving belt 500 and any cooling<br>
method will be selected to cool the material 415 into the fabric material 600, forming the prepreg<br>
445.<br>
[0098] In some embodiments, an underwater pelletizer is used for making pellets. In For<br>
example, a Gala type underwater pelletizer (available from Gala Industries, Inc. of Eagle Rock,<br>
VA) may be used for making pellets. Alternatively, a pastillator may be used for forming<br>
pastilles. For example, a Sandvik Rotoformer (available from Sandvik Process Systems of<br>
Totowa, NJ) may be used to form pastilles.<br>
[0099] In yet another aspect of the invention, the process of solvent removal and the<br>
process of shaping a partially-crystallized macrocyclic oligoester are combined, creating a<br>
continuous process from feeding a solution of a macrocyclic oligoester to shaping the<br>
macrocyclic oligoester. For example, in one embodiment, the process of solvent removal and the<br>
process of pastillation may be combined, thereby creating a continuous process from input<br>
solution of a macrocyclic oligoester to pastilles of macrocyclic oligoester substantially free from<br>
the solvent. In one embodiment, a solution of macrocyclic oligoester is provided. During the<br>
solvent removal process, the temperature often is elevated to between about 180°C and about<br>
200°C, and the pressure maintained between about atmospheric pressure and about 10 torr. In<br>
these embodiments, the solvent is continuously removed to produce a substantially solvent-free<br>
molten macrocyclic oligoester.<br>
[0100] The substantially solvent-free molten macrocyclic oligoester may be sheared at a<br>
temperature below the melting point of the molten macrocyclic oligoester to form a partially-<br>
crystallized macrocyclic oligoester. The shearing temperature may be maintained at, for<br>
example, between about 145°C and about 155°C. Subsequently, the partially-crystallized<br>
macrocyclic oligoester may be formed into any desirable shapes including pellets, pastilles, and<br>
flakes.<br>
[0101] Additives and fillers may be formulated with a macrocyclic oligoester or with a<br>
mixture of a macrocyclic oligoester and a catalyst. In one embodiment, the additive(s) and/or<br>
filler(s) are formulated with a macrocyclic oligoester while the latter macrocyclic oligoester is<br>
completely molten. In other embodiments, the additive(s) and/or filler(s) are formulated with a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester while the latter macrocyclic oligoester is partially molten and partially<br>
crystalline. In yet other embodiments, the additive(s) and/or fillers) are formulated with a<br>
macrocyclic oligoester while the macrocyclic oligoester is completely crystalline. The<br>
formulated macrocyclic oligoester is prepared into a prepreg in the form of pastilles on a fabric<br>
material.<br>
[0102] Pastille prepregs may be prepared from a blend material that includes macrocyclic<br>
oligoesters. In one embodiment, the invention relates to methods for preparing pastille<br>
thermoplastic prepregs based on a blend material that includes at least one macrocyclic oligoester<br>
and at least one polymerization catalyst.<br>
[0103] Thermoplastic prepregs typically have been produced with the resin close to the<br>
fiber. If the melt viscosity of the resin is high, the resin needs to be close to the fiber in order to<br>
wet-out the fiber properly. This typically is the case with thermoplastic prepregs made using a<br>
hot melt method with thermoplastic powder, co-mingled tows of reinforcing fiber and<br>
thermoplastic fiber, or co-woven fabrics. These materials require a process which often includes<br>
three steps: 1) heating and melting the resin, 2) wetting out of the fiber and consolidating, and 3)<br>
cooling down and solidifying.<br>
[0104] Macrocyclic oligoesters, as discussed above, melt to a low viscosity that may be<br>
many orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity of conventional thermoplastics. Thus,<br>
combining and wetting-out of macrocyclic oligoesters (when melted) with fillers and/or<br>
reinforcing fibers during the heating cycle of a process can be done much more easily than<br>
conventional thermoplastics. Hence, in prepreg fabrics made with macrocyclic oligoesters, the<br>
resin does not need to be distributed as close to the fiber (i.e., each and every fiber) as is needed<br>
for conventional thermoplastics. That is, resin can be placed at discrete locations, but melt and<br>
flow to wet-out the entire fabric when the resin is melted.<br>
[0105] When a prepreg is made with a blend material that includes a macrocyclic<br>
oligoester, the blend material can be a one-part ready-to-use system with a catalyst already<br>
included. FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of the invention, a process 7 for making a prepreg<br>
445 from a macrocyclic oligoester or a blend material of macrocyclic oligoester with one or more<br>
other components such as a polymerization catalyst. The process allows the making of a prepreg<br>
445 that has the desired resin and fabric material in a pre-selected ratio. Such prepregs can<br>
simplify upstream processes employing prepregs.<br>
[0106J Referring to FIG. 7, a blend material (e.g., a one-part system) is melted and<br>
applied to a reinforcing fabric 600 in discreet resin drops 415 and then cooled before significant<br>
polymerization takes place. The molten resin 505 is pumped into a channel in the bottom of a<br>
rotating cylinder 510 and comes out through the holes 507 in the cylinder each time the holes 507<br>
line up with the channel. In one embodiment, a rotating cylinder 510 available from Sandvik<br>
Process Systems of Totowa, NJ is employed in the process. Consequently, liquid drops of resin<br>
fall at pre-determined intervals onto a moving belt 500 (e.g., a steel belt). These discrete resin<br>
drops 415 can be arranged in a pre-selected array (e.g., a pattern) so that the amount of resin is<br>
uniform per unit fabric area (if uniformity is desired) and is of a desired value. In one<br>
embodiment, the amount of resin per unit fabric area ranges from about 3% by weight resin to<br>
about 97% by weight resin. In another embodiment, the amount of resin per unit fabric area<br>
ranges from about 30% by weight resin to about 80% by weight resin.<br>
[0107] The amount, pattern, and spacing of the dropped resin determine the "average"<br>
ratio of fabric material to resin before the resin is melted and distributed throughout the fabric<br>
material. There is no limitation as to the amount and pattern of the resin drops as long as the<br>
desired preregs are formed. The ratio of fabric material to resin may be uniform or varied across<br>
the prepreg and can be manipulated by controlling the size of each drop of resin and the space<br>
between them.<br>
[0108] FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of a solvent<br>
removal system where the solvent removal system 1 illustrated in FIG. 2 is linked with the<br>
solvent removal system 2 illustrated in FIG. 1. According to this embodiment, which is typically<br>
employed where the linear polyester depolymerization reaction product solution (i.e., the input<br>
solution) is a dilute (e.g., about 1% by weight macrocyclic oligoester), input solution 110 is first<br>
processed though system 1 to yield a resulting output solution 190. The solution 190 that is the<br>
product of system 1 typicaUy contains about 3% by weight macrocyclic oligoester. The solution<br>
190 enters system 2 as input solution 10. The input solution 10 is processed thorough system 2<br>
to yield, an output product 130 substantially free from solvent.<br>
[0109] FIG. 9 is a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of a system for shaping<br>
macrocyclic oligoesters from a solution of macrocyclic oligoester and solvent. According to this<br>
embodiment, the linked solvent removal systems 1 and 2, described above, are further linked to<br>
the process 5 for making pellets from a molten product illustrated in FIG. 5. The input solution<br>
110 is a dilute solution (e.g., about 1% by weight macrocyclic oligoester) which is first processed<br>
though system 1 to yield a resulting output solution 190. The solution 190 that is the product of<br>
system 1 typically contains about 3% by weight macrocyclic oligoester. Solution 190 enters<br>
system 2 as input solution 10 and is processed thorough system 2 to yield an output product 130<br>
substantially free from solvent. The output product 130 may be molten. Output product 130<br>
enters process 5 as molten macrocyclic oligoester 530, which is processed through system 5 to<br>
yield pellet 435.<br>
[0110] FIG. 10 is a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of a system for shaping<br>
macrocyclic oligoesters from a solution of macrocyclic oligoester and solvent. According to this<br>
embodiment, the solvent removal system 2 is linked to the process 5, described above, which<br>
make pellets from a molten product. According to this embodiment, the input solution 10<br>
containing about 3% by weight macrocyclic oligoester is processed thorough system 2 to yield an<br>
output product 130 substantially free from solvent In one embodiment, the output product 130<br>
is molten. Output product 130 enters system 5 as molten macrocyclic oligoester 530, which is<br>
processed through system 5 to yield pellet 435.<br>
[0111] Just as the processes in FIG. 8-10 can be linked to provide increased benefits, in<br>
other variations of such embodiments (not shown), alternative solvent removal system(s), for<br>
example, systems 1,2,3, and 4, described above with reference to FIGS. 1-4, may be linked to<br>
one another and/or to processes for shaping macrocyclic oligoesters from a solution of<br>
macrocyclic oligoester and solvent, such as, for example, processes 5, 6, and 7, described above<br>
with reference to FIGS. 5-7. For example, referring again to FIG. 8, FIG. 9, and FIG. 10 the<br>
solvent removal system 2 can be replaced by system 3 (FIG. 3) or system 4 (FIG. 4). Referring<br>
still to FIG. 9, and FIG. 10, the shaping process 5 can be replaced by process 6 (FIG. 6).<br>
[0112] The advantages of the above systems, processes and product prepregs include the<br>
ability to "drape" easily into a mold, the ability to flex without cracking and crumbling the resin<br>
drops, and the ability to use conventional pastillation equipment. Also, instead of placing the<br>
pellets on a conveyor belt, they are placed on a reinforcing fabric. In addition, the processes can<br>
be conducted isothermally (i.e. at constant temperature) and in a vacuum bag or in a compression<br>
molding press.<br>
[0113] Catalysts may be formulated with macrocyclic oligoesters to prepare prepregs.<br>

Examples<br>
[0118] The following examples are provided to further illustrate and to facilitate the<br>
understanding of the invention. These specific examples are intended to be illustrative of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example A<br>
[0119] The macrocyclic oligoesters used in the following examples are the macrocyclic<br>
oligoesters of 1,4-butylene terephthalate. The macrocyclic oligoesters were prepared by heating<br>
a mixture of polyester linears, organic solvents, such as o-xylene and o-dichlorobenzene, which<br>
are substantially free from oxygen and water, and tin or titanium compounds as<br>
transesterification catalysts. See U.S. Patent No. 5,668,186 (incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety).<br>
Example 1 Preparation of Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthatate) Oligomer Pellets<br>
[0120] Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester powder was fed at a rate of<br>
about 9 kg/hr through an extruder at about 120°C to melt into a paste and processed at a rate of<br>
about 9 kg/hr through a Gala underwater pelletizer available from Gala Industries (Eagle Rock,<br>
VA). No die freeze off was observed. The material cut cleanly on the die face. The pellets were<br>
strained out of the water and air dried to contain 80 ppm or less of water.<br>
Example 2 Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) Oligomer Pastilles<br>
[0121] Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligomer powder containing less than<br>
1,000 ppm solvent was melted in a tank at about 170°C and fed at a rate of 60 kg/hr to a Sandvik<br>
Rotoformer to form pastilles. No partial-crystallization was used. The pastilles were amorphous<br>
and agglomerated together. The macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligomer was pastilled<br>
smoothly into pastilles.<br>
Example 3 Formulated Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) Oligomer Pastilles<br>
[0122] Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester powder was melted and melt<br>
blended at a temperature between about 120°C and about 140°C with additives including a<br>
polymerization catalyst (0.33% by weight FASTCAT 4101 (Atofina, Philadelphia, PA)) and<br>
thermal stabilizers (0.4 % by weight IRGANOX 1010 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation,<br>
Tarrytown, NY)). The formulated product was then fed at a rate of about 45 kg/hr to the Sandvik<br>
Rotoformer to form pastilles, as in Example 2.<br>
Example 4 Formulated Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) Oligomer Pastilles on Glass<br>
Mat<br>
[0123] Macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester powder was melt blended with<br>
catalyst (0.33% by weight FASTCAT 4101 catalyst) and stabilizers (0.4 % by weight IRGANOX<br>
1010) and pastilled onto glass mat attached to the Sandvik Rotoformer belt. The Macrocyclic<br>
(1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester contained less than 1000 ppm solvent. The weight of<br>
macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester deposited onto an area of glass mat was<br>
controlled to between about 400 g/m2 to about 800 g/m2. The pastilles had a hemispherical shape<br>
and were about 7 mm in diameter, the pastilles were spaced about 15 mm apart from one another.<br>
The glass mat prepreg was flexible, with good adhesion of the macrocyclic (1,4-butylene<br>
terephthalate) oligoester pastilles. This prepreg mat can be cured to crystallize the macrocyclic<br>
(1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester to reduce moisture adsorption and tack. The prepreg was<br>
polymerized at a temperature of about 190°C to high molecular weight polyester (about 80,000<br>
Dalton).<br>
Example 5 Solvent Removal via Stripping<br>
[0124] A solution of macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate) oligoester in o-<br>
dichlorobenzene was fed to an Artisan evaporative stripper from Artisan Industries, Inc.<br>
(Waltham, MA.) A two-stage flash evaporator was operated at a temperature ranging between<br>
about 180°C and about 220°C and at a pressure ranging between about 10 torr and about<br>
atmospheric pressure to concentrate a 10% solution of macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate)<br>
oligomer to less than 100 ppm o-dichlorobenzene.<br>
Example 6 Solvent Removal via Evaporation and Stripping<br>
[0125] An input solution of 3 % by weight macrocyclic (1,4-butylene terephthalate)<br>
oligoester in o-dichlorobenzene solution was fed at a rate of about 6,045 kg/hr into a series of<br>
rising film evaporators and a falling film stripper available from Artisan Industries, Inc. to<br>
produce an output solution with solvent levels of less than 100 ppm at a rate of about 181 kg/hr.<br>
[0126] In one embodiment, the input solution, having a temperature of about 65°C, is fed<br>
at a rate of about 6,045 kg/hr into a first rising film evaporator having an evaporation surface area<br>
of about 317 ft2. The first rising film evaporator is held at temperature of about 180°C at<br>
atmospheric pressure. Thereafter, the solution exits the first rising film evaporator and enters a<br>
first flash device. The first flash device is held at temperature of about 180°C at atmospheric<br>
pressure. A first condenser captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the first rising film<br>
evaporator and the first flash device.<br>
[0127] The solution exits the first flash device and travels at a temperature of about<br>
180°C to a second rising film evaporator. The second rising film evaporator has an evaporation<br>
surface area of about 81 ft2 and is held at a temperature of about 193°C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The solution exiting the second rising film evaporator has a temperature of about 193°C and<br>
enters a second flash device. The second flash device is held at a temperature of about 180°C at<br>
atmospheric pressure. A second condenser captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the<br>
second rising film evaporator and the second flash device.<br>
[0128] The solution exits the second flash device and travels to a third rising film<br>
evaporator. The third rising film evaporator has an evaporation surface area of about 21 ft2 and<br>
is held at temperature of about 199°C at atmospheric pressure. Thereafter, the solution exits the<br>
third rising film evaporator at a temperature of about 199°C and enters a third flash device. The<br>
third flash device is held at a temperature of about 180°C at atmospheric pressure. A third<br>
condenser captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the third rising film evaporator and<br>
the third flash device.<br>
[0129] The solution exits the third flash device and travels to a fourth rising film<br>
evaporator. The fourth rising film evaporator has an evaporation surface area of about 8 ft2 and<br>
is held at temperature of about 204°C at atmospheric pressure. Thereafter, the solution exits the<br>
fourth rising film evaporator at a temperature of about 204°C and enters a fourth flash device.<br>
The fourth flash device is held at a temperature of about 180°C at atmospheric pressure. A<br>
fourth condenser captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the fourth rising film<br>
evaporator and the fourth flash device. Each of the four condensers employ cooling water to<br>
condense the vaporized solvent and bring the condensed solvent to a temperature of about 176°C.<br>
[0130] The solution exits the fourth flash device and travels to a fifth rising film<br>
evaporator. The fifth rising film evaporator has an evaporation surface area of about 10 fr and is<br>
held at temperature of about 226°C at a pressure of about 1 torr. Thereafter, the solution exits<br>
the fifth rising film evaporator at a temperature of about 226°C and enters the top of a falling<br>
film stripper. The falling film stripper is held at a temperature of about 226°C at a pressure of<br>
about 1 torr. A vacuum pump captures the vaporized solvent that is removed in the falling film<br>
stripper and the fifth rising film evaporator. The vacuum pump is held at about 0.5 torr. The<br>
vaporized solvent travels from the vacuum pump to a fifth condenser. The fifth condenser is<br>
sized at 75 ft2 and employs cooling water to condense the vaporized solvent and bring the<br>
condensed solvent to a temperature of about 176°C.<br>
[0131] Nitrogen from a nitrogen sparger is introduced to the solution traveling through<br>
the falling film stripper at a rate of about 9 kg/hr. After sparging, the macrocyclic oligoester<br>
product has a temperature of about 226°C and contains less than 100 ppm solvent. The<br>
macrocyclic oligoester exits the process at a rate of about 181 kg/hr.<br>
[0132] Alternatively, a single flash device or a single condenser is employed in place of<br>
two or more of the flash devices and two or more of the condensers that are described. A single<br>
flash device may be employed in the place of the second, third, and fourth flash devices<br>
described above. A single flash device may house three distinct conduits for the solutions exiting<br>
the second, third, and fourth rising film evaporators. Such a flash device may have three<br>
conduits that are adjacent to one another. The flash device may also be constructed so that the<br>
conduit for the solution exiting the third rising film evaporator is placed inside the conduit for the<br>
solution exiting the second rising film evaporator, and the conduit for the solution exiting the<br>
fourth rising film evaporator is placed inside the conduit for the solution exiting the third rising<br>
film evaporator. A single condenser (e.g., a condenser with a 500 ft2 area) may be employed in<br>
the place of the second, third, and fourth condenser described above.<br>
