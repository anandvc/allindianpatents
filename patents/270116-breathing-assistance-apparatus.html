BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a gases supply and gases humidification apparatus that can<br>
be disinfected and reused for different patients. The invention also relates to a method for<br>
disinfecting apparatus parts that extend the life of these parts for use by a single patient.<br>
Summary of the Prior Art<br>
A number of methods are known in the art for assisting a patient's breathing.<br>
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) involves the administration of air under<br>
pressure to a patient, usually by a nasal mask. It is used in the treatment of snoring and<br>
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), a condition characterised by repetitive collapse of the<br>
upper airway during inspiration. Positive pressure splints the upper airway open,<br>
preventing its collapse. Treatment of OSA with nasal CPAP has proven to be both<br>
effective and safe, but CPAP is difficult to use and the majority of patients experience<br>
significant side effects, particularly in the early stages of treatment.<br>
CPAP is also commonly used for patients with a variety of respiratory illnesses,<br>
including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).<br>
Upper airway symptoms adversely affect treatment with CPAP. Mucosal drying is<br>
uncomfortable and may awaken patients during the night. Rebound nasal congestion<br>
commonly occurs during the following day, simulating a viral infection. If untreated,<br>
upper airway symptoms adversely affect rates of CPAP use.<br>
Increases in nasal resistance may affect the level of CPAP treatment delivered to<br>
the pharynx, and reduce the effectiveness of treatment. An individual pressure is<br>
determined for each patient using CPAP and this pressure is set at the patient interface.<br>
Changes in nasal resistance affect pressure delivered to the pharynx and if the changes are<br>
of sufficient magnitude there may be recurrence of snoring or airway collapse or reduce the<br>
level of pressure applied to the lungs. Such symptoms can also occur in a hospital<br>
environment where a patient is on a respirator. Typically in such situations the patient is<br>
intubated. Therefore the throat tissue may become irritated and inflamed causing both<br>
distress to the patient and possible further respiratory problems.<br><br>
A number of methods may be employed to treat such upper airway symptoms,<br>
including pharmacological agents to reduce nasal disease, or heating the bedroom. One<br>
most commonly employed method is humidification of the inspired air using an in line<br>
humidifier. Two types of humidifier are currently used. Cold pass-over humidifiers rely<br>
on humidifying the air through exposure to a large surface area of water. While they are<br>
cheap, the humidity output is low at high flows, typically 2 to 4 mg\L absolute humidity at<br>
flows above 25L/min. The output is insufficient to prevent mucosal drying. Heated water<br>
bath humidifiers are more efficient, and produce high levels of humidity even at high flow<br>
rates. They are effective at preventing upper airway mucosal drying, prevent increases in<br>
nasal resistance, and are the most reliable means of treating upper airway symptoms.<br>
Oxygen is the most common drug prescribed to hospitalized patients. The delivery<br>
of oxygen via nasal cannula or facemask is of benefit to a patient complaining of<br>
breathlessness. By increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygen therapy reduces the<br>
effort to breathe and can correct resulting hypoxia (a low level of oxygen in the tissues).<br>
The duration of the therapy depends on the underlying illness. For example,<br>
postoperative patients may only receive oxygen while recovering from surgery while<br>
patients with COPD require oxygen 16 to 18 hours per day.<br>
Currently greater than 16 million adults are afflicted with COPD, an umbrella term<br>
that describes a group of lung diseases characterized by irreversible airflow limitation that<br>
is associated mainly with emphysema and chronic bronchitis, most commonly caused by<br>
smoking over several decades. When airway limitation is moderately advanced, it<br>
manifests as perpetual breathlessness, without physical exertion. Situations such as a<br>
tracheobronchial infection, heart failure and also environmental exposure can incite an<br>
exacerbation of COPD that requires hospitalization until the acute breathlessness is under<br>
control. During an acute exacerbation of COPD, the patient experiences an increase in<br>
difficulty of breathing (dyspnea), hypoxia, and increase in sputum volume and purulence<br>
and increased coughing.<br>
Oxygen therapy provides enormous benefit to patients with an acute exacerbation<br>
of COPD who are hypoxic, by decreasing the risk of vital organ failure and reducing<br>
dyspnea. The major complication associated with oxygen therapy is hypercapnia (an<br>
elevation in blood carbon dioxide levels) and subsequent respiratory failure. Therefore, the<br>
dose of oxygen administered can be critical and must be precisely known.<br><br>
To accurately control the oxygen dose given to a patient, the oxygen-enriched gas<br>
must exceed the patient's peak inspiratory flow to prevent the entrainment of room air and<br>
dilution of the oxygen. To achieve this, flows of greater than 20 L/min are common. Such<br>
flows of dry gases cause dehydration and inflammation of the nasal passages and airways<br>
if delivered by nasal cannula. To avoid this occurrence, a heated humidifier is used.<br>
The majority of systems that are used for oxygen therapy or merely delivery of<br>
gases to a patient consists of a gases supply, a humidifier and conduit. Interfaces include<br>
facemasks, oral mouthpieces, tracheostomy inlets and nasal cannula, the latter having the<br>
advantage of being more comfortable and acceptable than a facemask.<br>
A group of patients who would benefit from humidification therapy are patients<br>
who have mucociliary clearance deficiencies. These patients often have purulent mucus<br>
and are susceptible to infections from pathogens.<br>
Heated humidified air with an abundance of water particles is an ideal medium to<br>
harbour disease carrying pathogens. Consequently, considerable design expertise has been<br>
required to provide the market with active pass-over humidifiers that deliver water<br>
molecules, in gas phase only, so that it is not possible for disease pathogens to be carried in<br>
air to the patient. Water that condenses on the inner surfaces of the breathing circuit or<br>
conduit at the end of a treatment session may harbour pathogens that would be delivered to<br>
the patient next time they use the device. This is particularly the case with humidification<br>
therapies where patients are receiving body temperature fully saturated air.<br>
In hospital environments or similar it is often not possible for gases supply devices,<br>
such as devices that deliver CPAP and include a humidifier, to be used by multiple<br>
patients. If devices were to be used in this manner all parts, from the humidification<br>
chamber to and including the patient interface, must be disposed of or cleaned to a high<br>
standard of disinfection in between use by different patients. Often CPAP devices and<br>
humidifiers are provided in an integrated unit, such as the Sleepstyle™ 600 series CPAP<br>
device of Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Limited. This CPAP device is predominantly used<br>
for home use by an individual. This device has internal tubing from the outlet of the<br>
humidification chamber that is difficult to disinfect. As these devices are difficult to<br>
disinfect they are often not used in settings such as hospitals or clinics where multiple<br>
patients will use the device.<br><br>
In the home use situation when oxygen therapy and CPAP devices are used by a<br>
single patient the lifespan of the breathing tube and patient interface is determined by the<br>
mechanical lifespan of the parts and the build up of microbial pathogens on the breathing<br>
gases path of these parts. Often it is hard to lower microbial contamination on the<br>
breathing gas surfaces of these parts.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a breathing assistance apparatus that has a<br>
convenient and effective method of cleaning internal conduits inside the apparatus. As<br>
shown in Figure 1, the flow of gases passes in sequence through a gases supply means or<br>
flow driver (such as, a blower, fan or compressor), humidification chamber, heated<br>
delivery circuit and patient interface.<br>
Further the present invention also provides a method of disinfecting a heated<br>
breathing conduit and a patient interface.<br>
Gases are passed to the patient by way of a patient interface 2. The patient<br>
interface used with the apparatus of the present invention may be a full-face mask, nasal<br>
mask, nasal cannula, oral mouthpiece or tracheostomy connection, but the description<br>
below and figures disclose the use of a nasal cannula.<br>
With reference to Figure 1 the breathing assistance apparatus of the present<br>
invention is shown in which a patient 1 is receiving humidified and pressurised gases<br>
through a nasal cannula 2. The cannula 2 is connected to a gases transportation pathway or<br>
inspiratory conduit 3 that in turn is connected to an integrated gases supply (blower) and<br>
humidifying device 4 (including a humidification chamber 5). In the preferred<br>
embodiment of the blower-humidifying device 4, the gases supply or blower is combined<br>
in one housing with the humidifier and humidification chamber. The humidification<br>
chamber 5 extends out from the housing 10 and is capable in use of being removed and<br>
replaced (by a slide on movement, such as that described in WO04024429 of Fisher &amp;<br>
Paykel Healthcare Limited, the contents of which are incorporated by reference) by the<br>
patient or other user. Also, the gases supply outlet port 11 (see Figure 2) that feeds the<br>
inlet to the humidification chamber 5 is internal within the housing 10.<br><br>
The humidification chamber 5 contains a volume of water 6. It must be<br>
appreciated that the embodiment described above in relation to the housing and figures<br>
merely illustrates one form of the housing of the integrated gases supply and<br>
humidifying device.<br>
The inspiratory conduit 3 (see Figure 1) is connected to a patient outlet 8.<br>
Inspirator}' conduit 3 preferably contains heating means or heater wires 7 that heat the<br>
walls of the conduit to reduce condensation of humidified gases within the conduit and<br>
the patient interface (e.g. nasal cannula 2) such the conduit as described in<br>
WO04026382 of Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Limited, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
The humidification chamber 5 is, preferably formed from a plastics material and<br>
may have a highly heat conductive base ( for example an aluminium base ) that is in<br>
direct contact with a heater plate 25. The device 4 is provided with control means or an<br>
electronic controller that may comprise a microprocessor based controller executing<br>
computer software commands stored in associated memory. The controller receives<br>
input from sources such as user input means or dial (not shown) through which a user of<br>
the device 4 may, for example, set a predetermined required value (present value) of<br>
humidity or temperature of the gases supplied to patient 1.	,<br>
In response to the user set humidity or temperature value input via dial (or<br>
buttons) and other possible inputs such as internal sensors that sense gases flow or<br>
temperature, or by parameters calculated in the controller, the controller determines<br>
when (or to what level) to energise heater plate to heat the water 6 within humidification<br>
chamber 5. As the volume of water 6 within humidification chamber 5 is heated, water<br>
vapour begins to fill the volume of the chamber above the water's surface and is passed<br>
out of the humidification chamber outlet 15 with the flow of gases (for example air)<br>
provided from a blower part of the device that has entered the device 4 through an inlet<br>
9 on the back of the device 4.<br>
The gases supply within the device 4 is preferably a variable speed pump or fan<br>
that draws air or other gases through the blower inlet 9. The speed of variable speed<br>
pump or fan is preferably controlled by the control means or electronic controller<br>
described above in response to inputs entered into the device 4 by the user.<br>
Disinfection of the Device<br><br>
A partially exploded view of a gases supply and humidification device 4 is<br>
shown in Figure 2. The device 4 has an elbowed connection conduit 12 that has an<br>
patient return 13, which is the gases return in the housing 4, and an outlet end, that is the<br>
patient outlet 8 of the housing 4, The conduit 12 is provided to receive humidified gases<br>
from the humidification chamber 5 and as such the inlet end or gases return 13 is<br>
connected to the outlet 15 of the humidification chamber. The humidified gases are<br>
directed from the patient outlet 8 into the breathing conduit 3 (see Figure 1) for delivery<br>
to a patient. It is preferred that the elbowed connection conduit 12 is permanently fixed<br>
in place in the housing 4.<br>
There is requirement for multiple users to use these devices as they will be used<br>
in hospitals, sleep laboratories or leased by home care companies and hospitals for short<br>
term home users.<br>
To use such a gases supply and humidification device 4 on multiple patients the<br>
elbow conduit 12 integrated into the device must have a high level disinfection process<br>
carried out between different patients using it. For ease of use, even if the elbow conduit<br>
12 can be removed and to avoid dismantling and potential damage to the internal parts<br>
of the device 4 it is preferred that the elbow is disinfected in situ. This is because it is<br>
often impractical to remove the elbow, as it may have electrical connectors and the like,<br>
and clean it and reconnect it. Furthermore, the high labour content and skill level<br>
required would make removing the elbow an unreliable cleaning method and may make<br>
the device more unreliable.<br>
Other parts of the device 4, such as the gas supply outlet 11, may also need high<br>
level disinfection between patients and could benefit from the present invention.<br>
Currently high level disinfection is performed either by thermal or chemical<br>
process. Thermal disinfection is normally carried out by submersion in hot water or<br>
steam and chemical disinfection by submersion in instrument grade disinfectants.<br>
These processes have disadvantages for high level disinfection of devices- such<br>
as the gases supply and humidification device 4 of the present invention as it cannot be<br>
submersed; steam sterilized or easily chemically disinfected.<br>
A further option for thermal disinfection is hot dry air. The present invention is<br>
the supply of a heated gases tube (disinfection conduit) for use with a device 4 to allow<br>
in particular for disinfection of the elbow conduit 12. A disinfection conduit 14 is<br>
shown in Figure 3. To disinfect the elbow conduit 12 a first end 17 of the<br><br>
disinfection conduit 14 is connected to the gases supply outlet 11 and a second end 18 to<br>
the outlet end 8 of the elbow conduit 12. The disinfection conduit 14 preferably has a<br>
heating element 19 within, through out or about the walls of the disinfection conduit 14.<br>
For example, the disinfection conduit 14 may be a section of tubing as described in<br>
WO04026382 of Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Limited with appropriate connectors on<br>
both ends of the tube to enable connection to the elbow conduit 12 and the gases supply<br>
outlet 11.<br>
It is preferred that a removable exhaust gases filter 20 is placed on the patient<br>
return 13 of the elbow conduit 12. This filter 20 is shown in more detail in Figures 5<br>
and 6. In Figure 5, a filter housing 21 can be placed about the patient return 13. The<br>
filter housing 21 is preferably made of a plastics material and can be simply removably<br>
attached to the patient return 13, , and remains on the end 13 by a friction fit. A<br>
preferably circular piece of filter material (not shown in this figure), sits inside the filter<br>
housing 21 and therefore occludes the patient return 13, such that when in use with the<br>
disinfection conduit as described and shown with reference to Figure 3, gases exiting<br>
the patient return 13 are filtered before they exit to the ambient surroundings.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, the filter housing 21 is shown in further detail. Preferably<br>
a projection 22 is provided with the filter 20 and housing 21. This tubular projection 22<br>
sits within the patient return 13 and the filter housing 21 sits about the projection 22 and<br>
over the end of the inlet 13. The projection 22 has the purpose of increasing the gases<br>
velocity at the point where heated gases are exiting the patient return 13 (when the<br>
disinfection conduit 14 is in place as described above and in use). This has the effect of<br>
maximising the exhaust temperature of the exiting gases and minimising the<br>
temperature drop at the exit point. This ensures there is a high level of disinfection<br>
throughout the entire elbow conduit 12. In use the heated gases flow around the<br>
spherical end 23 of the projection 22 down the sides of the tubular inlet end (in the<br>
direction of arrows A) through apertures (not shown) in the projection 22 through the<br>
filter material 20 and past the filter housing 21 into the ambient surroundings.<br>
When the disinfection conduit 14 is connected between the gases supply outlet<br>
11 and the patient outlet 8 as described above, the device 4 may be put into a cleaning<br>
mode whereby dry gases, such as air, are circulated through the disinfection conduit 14<br>
and elbow conduit 12. It is preferable that the circulated gases are heated by the<br>
disinfection<br><br>
conduit to a temperature of 80°C. However, a temperature between 60°C and 90°C may be<br>
suitable.<br>
The connectors at both ends 17, 18 of the disinfection conduit 14 preferably have<br>
pneumatic fittings. Preferably the second end 18 of the disinfection conduit 14 has an<br>
electrical connection such that the heating element 19 within the conduit 14 can be<br>
supplied from the device 4 with power. In other forms of the device both ends 17, 18 may<br>
have electrical and pneumatic connections.<br>
The device 4, and in particular, the controllers within the device 4 that control the<br>
heating of the heater plate as described above, is capable of controlling the temperature of<br>
the heating element 19.<br>
The device 4 preferably has a setting that causes the controllers to provide a flow of<br>
gases, for example, between 1 and 50 litres per minute, to the disinfection conduit 14 and<br>
simultaneously provide power to the heating element 19, such that the gases circulating<br>
through the conduit 14 increase in temperature to 80°C. The controller then maintains the<br>
power to the heating element 19 maintaining a predetermined temperature inside the<br>
conduit 12 for a period of time, preferably 20 minutes, in order for the heated dry gases to<br>
disinfect the elbow conduit 12.<br>
Therefore in use, after a patient has used the device 4 of the present invention, and<br>
before the next patient uses it, the patient, hospital staff or home care supplier can connect<br>
the disinfection conduit 14 to the device 4, as described above, and put the device 4 into a<br>
cleaning mode. As an example, a person might put the device into a cleaning mode by<br>
activating a button on the device that causes the controllers to provide power to the heating<br>
element and gases to the disinfection conduit at a predetermined temperature over a set<br>
period of time. In the preferred method of disinfecting the device, it is preferred that the<br>
surface temperatures inside the elbow conduit reaches a minimum of 80°C for a time<br>
period of 20 minutes and the flow provided for circulation through the elbow conduit is<br>
approximately 10 litres per minute. However, other appropriate circulating flows between<br>
1 and 50 litres per minute and other appropriate time periods and temperatures may be<br>
used.<br>
In the preferred form of the present invention the elbow conduit 12 preferably has a<br>
temperature sensor 24 within it, for example, as shown in Figure 7. However, in other<br>
forms of the invention, the elbow conduit may not have such a sensor.<br><br>
In the preferred form this sensor measures the temperature of gases travelling<br>
through the conduit 12. In particular, in the preferred form of the method of disinfecting,<br>
at the start of the disinfection process, the controller or electronics within the device 4<br>
performs some checks to ensure the disinfection conduit is correctly connected to the<br>
device 4. Firstly, a check is performed to determine that there is a heated gases flow<br>
through the elbow conduit 12. When the gas flow supplied by the device 4 and heater<br>
element 19 of the disinfection conduit 14 are both turned on, the heated gases flow is<br>
measured by the internal temperature sensor 24 inside the elbow conduit 12. After a<br>
predetermined period the heater element 19 is turned off with the gases flow of the device<br>
4 left on. After a further predetermined period, the temperature inside the elbow conduit<br>
12 is again measured by the temperature sensor 24. It is expected that the temperature will<br>
have dropped between measurements. This proves there is a fluid connection of gases<br>
supply connecting the flow source to the elbow conduit 12.<br>
If a rise in temperature and a falf in temperature between measurements is not<br>
detected by the sensor 24 an error alarm will be indicated on or audibly relayed by the<br>
device, indicating the disinfection conduit 14 is not connected to the device 4 correctly.<br>
Knowing the gases flow, ambient temperature outside the device. 4 (as the device 4<br>
has an ambient air temperature sensor incorporated within it) and the time period, in which<br>
the heating element 19 is powered, an expected temperature can be calculated for the<br>
heating and non-heating periods described above. The expected temperature can then be<br>
compared with the actual measured temperature from the temperature sensor. If these<br>
match, then the checks are complete and the disinfection conduit 14 and heating element<br>
19 are connected and working correctly. The disinfection method, cleaning mode, as<br>
described above is then started.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the disinfection conduit may be<br>
used on a blower and humidifying device that does not have an internal temperature sensor<br>
inside the elbow conduit. In this embodiment a predetermined gases flow is caused to pass<br>
through the disinfection conduit, and a predetermined power is applied to the heating<br>
element within the disinfection conduit. The ambient conditions are known. The<br>
predetermined gases flow and predetermined power applied are determined such that the<br>
internal surface temperatures inside the elbow conduit will exceed the temperatures<br><br>
required for high level disinfection for a range of ambient conditions. The predetermined<br>
temperature and power are preferably determined from testing and the like.<br>
The method of disinfection described above has been validated by an independent<br>
laboratory, Toxikon Corporation of Bedford, MA, USA.<br>
The method of disinfection as described above is automated so minimal training is<br>
required to disinfect the elbow conduit and it is not necessary to dismantle the gases supply<br>
and humidification device, therefore, inadvertent damage to the internal parts of the device<br>
is avoided.<br>
Also, during the disinfection period the internal surface temperature of the elbow<br>
conduit is continuously monitored so each disinfection cycle can be validated and a<br>
disinfection completed symbol shown on the display at the completion of the process.<br>
Alternatively, if the disinfection cycle was not validated a failed disinfection symbol can<br>
be displayed to alert a user or operator.<br>
Disinfection of Inspiratory Conduit and Patient Interface<br>
In a second form of a blower-humidifying device 4 of the present invention a<br>
method of disinfecting an inspiratory conduit 3 and/or patient interface 2 is disclosed.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 and as detailed above, the inspiratory conduit 3 preferably has<br>
a heating means or wires 7 within it. The wires 7 within the conduit 3 mean it can be<br>
difficult or dangerous to clean and disinfect the conduit. Therefore, prolonged use of the<br>
conduit by a patient results in high microbial contamination inside the conduit.<br>
Consequently there is a danger of infection of the patient from continual use of the conduit<br>
3. Therefore, for home use where patients are reusing the inspiratory conduit 3 and patient<br>
interface 2 over a substantial period it is preferable to provide a method of cleaning and<br>
disinfecting the conduit 3 and patient interface 2.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, in the standard configuration the blower and humidifying<br>
device is used with a heated breathing conduit (inspiratory conduit 3) connected to the<br>
patient outlet 8 of the device 4. The patient interface 2 is connected to the other end of the<br>
conduit 3.<br>
The method of disinfecting is to force dry heat through the conduit and optionally<br>
the patient interface, to heat and dry the conduit and patient interface such that bacteria and<br>
microbes are killed and cannot multiply in the dry conditions. After a patient has<br>
completed their treatment (for example, each morning) the patient empties the<br><br>
humidification chamber and presses a button, fox example, on the device 4 thereby<br>
activating a control sequence or algorithm. The control sequence or algorithm is preferably<br>
stored in the controller (described above). A button on the device 4 may activate the<br>
control sequence but other means of activating the sequence may be provided, for example,"<br>
the device may automatically activate the conduit disinfecting control sequence a<br>
predetermined time after completion of treatment (removal of the patient interface, for<br>
example) has been detected and the controller of the device has detected the humidification<br>
chamber is empty. The controller then controls the heater plate 25 to maintain heat to the<br>
humidifying chamber 5 and the blower 4 continues to supply gases to the chamber 5, such<br>
that heated dry gases pass through the chamber 5 to the conduit 3. At the same time, the<br>
power to the heating means or wires 7 is maintained to provide additional heat to the gases<br>
within the conduit 3. The heating of the gases is preferably at approximately 40°C and the<br>
exit temperature from the tube is between 40°C and 75°C. The disinfecting and heating<br>
sequence preferably continues for between 30 and 120 minutes.<br>
More particularly, the humidification chamber heater heats the gases until the<br>
temperature of the gases in the return elbow (patient return 13) reaches 40°C. The<br>
heating wires in the heated breathing conduit heats the air passing down the conduit<br>
until a temperature sensor at the patient end of the conduit reaches approx 50°C. In<br>
other implementations it is possible that this temperature may be raised to as high as<br>
70°C.<br>
In some forms of this method, a cap is placed on the patient end of the heated<br>
breathing conduit 3 (in place of the patient interface 2). The cap allows the heated gases to<br>
build up in the conduit thereby increasing the effectiveness of the disinfection process.<br>
The purpose of the cap is to ensure that a patient is not wearing the patient interface. The<br>
device 4 controller can determine this by the different pressure and flow characteristic of<br>
the gases when the cap is on the distal end of the conduit 3 compared to that characteristic<br>
when the patient interface is attached to the end of the conduit 3. With a certainty that<br>
there is no patient connected the air in the heated breathing conduit can be heated to<br>
temperatures well above safe gas breathing temperatures which improves the efficacy of<br>
the disinfection process.<br>
In other forms of this method, the patient interface 2 is left in place at the distal end<br>
of the conduit 3 and is exposed to the heated and dry gases. In further forms the patient<br>
interface 2 during the disinfection process may be housed in a receptacle that allows<br><br>
increased heat build up to occur in the patient interface, again, increasing the effectiveness<br>
of disinfection. By putting the interface in a receptacle it can be ensured that a patient<br>
cannot be using the interface for breathing, and the controlling device can detect there is no<br>
patient connected, again because of the different pressure flow characteristic. The heated<br>
breathing conduit can then be heated to temperatures well above safe gases breathing<br>
temperatures. Again this improves the efficacy of the disinfection process.<br>
The purpose of this disinfection process is to increase the useable life of the heated<br>
breathing conduit by lowering microbial contamination on the inside surfaces the gases<br>
pass over. If the heated breathing tube is not cleaned regularly, and this is difficult with an<br>
internal heating wire, microbes can build to a level that the inside of the surfaces of the<br>
conduit become colonised with bacteria, thereby lowering the useful life of the conduit,<br>
making treatment more inconvenient for the patient.<br>
Tests were carried out on a heated breathing conduit in normal use for 2 months at<br>
home by patients with no disinfection process. The conduits were then tested for<br>
contamination. The results were that contamination within the conduits had reached a<br>
level of bacterial contamination that made the conduits unsafe for use.<br>
Further tests were also carried out with identical heated breathing conduits used<br>
under the same conditions for 2 months as described above. The conduits were then<br>
processed with the dry heat disinfection method described above. The result was that<br>
bacterial contamination was lowered (compared to the conduits that had not been treated)<br>
to a level that the conduits could continue to be used safely.<br>
This disinfection method by dry heat shows that bacterial contamination can be<br>
effectively lowered to a level that the conduits could continue to be used by patients.<br><br>
