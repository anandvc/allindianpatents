				<td>TOOTHBRUSH THAT PROVIDES ENHANCED CLEANING AND COMFORT<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a manually manipulated toothbrush having a head with flexible sections that provide enhanced cleaning and comfort when used.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Conventional toothbrushes usually include a substantially rigid head with an outer surface from which cleaning elements extend. Conventional cleaning elements include bristles arranged in bristle tufts, elastomeric members or other known cleaning elements. However, rigid portions of certain conventional toothbrush heads can prevent the cleaning elements from being comfortably received in the mouth, and thereby prevent effective cleaning of the oral cavity.<br>
[0003] To eliminate the problems associated with large, rigid toothbrush heads, certain conventional toothbrush heads include flexible segments that allow carried cleaning elements to move relative to the head. However, these flexible segments may not fit comfortably within the mouth of the user. Similarly, because of the size and/or shape of the flexible segments, the heads may not be comfortably manipulated within the mouth of the user during cleaning. As a result, the toothbrush may not be used on a regular basis. Additionally, when introduced into the mouth, the toothbnish may not be used for a period'of time sufficient to provide the person with effective oral cleaning. It is also possible that the cleaning elements may not be capable of reaching all intended portions of the mouth. This can result in poor oral hygiene that can cause tooth and/or gum disease.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with flexible cleaning element support members that provide the user with enhanced cleaning and comfort during brushing. The cleaning element support members permit a head of the toothbrush to be comfortably received and manipulated within the user's mouth.<br>
[0005] In one aspect of the invention, the toothbrush includes a head with a first flexible cleaning element support member positioned at a first end of the head, a second flexible cleaning element support member positioned at a second, free end of the head<br><br>
and at least one intermediate flexible cleaning element support member. Each flexible cleaning element support member has a flexible stem formed of a soft, resilient material that is comfortable to the user when the material contacts a portion of the user's mouth. Additionally, the flexible cleaning element support members carry cleaning elements. The flexibility of these support members allows the cleaning elements to move easily in different directions during brushing, thereby providing enhanced cleaning.<br>
[0006] In another aspect of the invention, the toothbrush has at least two flexible cleaning element support members that each forms a continuous outer surface with a respective end of the head so that the head can be comfortably received and manipulated in a mouth.<br>

[0011] Figure 5 is an elevational view of a portion of the toothbrush shown in Figure 1 taken opposite the view of Figure 4.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] Figure 1 illustrates a toothbrush 10 according to an aspect of the present invention. The toothbrush 10 includes an elongated handle (not shown) that may be formed of any shape and with a variety of constructions that permit the toothbrush 10 to be readily gripped and manipulated for effective tooth and gum cleaning. The toothbrush 10 also includes a neck 14 and a head 20 having a first end 21 proximate the neck 14 and a second, free end 22 distal the neck 14. The head 20 also includes a base 24 and spaced cleaning element support members 26. The base 24 provides an area onto which the cleaning element support members 26 are secured, in any known manner (See Figure 2).<br><br>
[0013] Figure 2 illustrates an isolated example of a cleaning element support member 26 according to an aspect of the present invention. The exemplary cleaning element support member 26 includes a stem 27 and a flexion control member 28 positioned within the stem 27. The cleaning element support members 26 also include a support head 23 with a section 29 that overhangs the stem 27 in the direction of the center of the other cleaning element support members 26. The body of the stem 27 that surrounds each flexion control member 28 and each support head 23 are formed of flexible materials, such as flexible resins. In an embodiment, the flexible resins usable with the support members 26 include soft thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). Other soft, resilient materials can also be used to form the stems 27 and the support heads 23. The resilient material of the support members 26 serves to bias the stems 27 and flexion control members 28 back to initial, rest position after they have been deflected. This return action creates an active motion in the opposite direction of the initial flexion of the support members 27, which aids in the cleaning of teeth by introducing additional cleaning strokes and by strengthening the cleaning stroke because of the bias force created by the material.<br>
[0014] The flexion control members 28 limit the flexibility of their respective support members 26. The internally extending flexion control members 28 can be of any shape that allows some flex and have a cross-section that is circular, square or any other geometric shape that provides a thin dimension or thin diameter about which the support member 26 can bend. The size of this thin dimension/diameter can contribute to the total amount of flex experienced by each cleaning element support member 26.<br>
[0015] The flexion control members 28 are each secured to the base 24 or alternatively, they are formed together with the base 24 as an integral unit. The flexion control members 28 can be formed of conventional hard plastic materials, such as polypropylene. In an alternative embodiment, the flexion control members 28 can be formed of a more flexible material that allows their respective stems 27 additional movement in a direction at an angle to its length during brushing. For example, each stem 27 would be capable of deflecting in a direction toward the center of the head 20<br><br>
and, in embodiments, for example, with circular cross sections, deflect in all directions that extend at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the support member 26.<br>
[0016] The cleaning element support members 26 also include carriers 25 that each supports at least one cleaning element 50. The cleaning elements can be used to clean the teeth, gums and/or tongue of a user. In the illustrated embodiment of Figure 1, the cleaning elements 50 are in the form of bristles arranged in bristle tufts 52 that are secured to the carriers 25. However, one or more elastomeric members or other forms of cleaning members may be used to form the cleaning elements in lieu of or in addition to the use of bristles arranged in bristle tufts. The term "cleaning element" is intended to be used in a generic sense which could also include massage elements and other forms of cleaning elements such as elastomeric fingers or walls arranged in a circular cross-sectional shape or any type of desired shape and/or cross-section including straight portions or sinusoidal portions.<br>
[0017] The carriers 25 are each supported by a flexion control member 28 and secured to the support head 23 of their respective stem 27, as illustrated in Figure 2. The carriers 25 are preferably formed from conventional hard plastic materials, such as polypropylene, commonly used in the making of toothbrush handles and heads. However, other known hard materials can be also be used. The cleaning elements 50 extend from the carriers 25 for performing an oral care function within the mouth of the user. The tooth cleaning elements 50 can be anchored to their carrier 25 using any known technique. For example, the tooth cleaning elements 50 can be anchored into their carrier 25 during the formation of the carrier 25 (e.g., in mold tufting or anchor free tufting). Alternatively, the cleaning elements 50 can be anchored using other known techniques, such as, stapling, pinning or gluing.<br>
[0018] While Figures 2-5 illustrate the cleaning elements 50 oriented generally perpendicular to the outer surface of base 24, some or all of the cleaning elements 50 may be oriented at various angles with respect to the outer surface of the base 24. It is thereby possible to select the combination of cleaning element configurations, materials and orientations to achieve specific intended results to deliver additional oral health benefits, like enhanced cleaning, tooth polishing, tooth whitening and/or massaging of the gums.<br><br>
[0019] As shown in Figures 1-3, the head 20 includes a plurality of the exemplary cleaning element support members 26. In the illustrated embodiment, the head 20 includes three spaced cleaning element support members 30, 40,60 having the same components as support members 26. However, the head 20 can include only two or more than three support elements spaced along the head 20. The positioning of the support elements 26 along the head 20 is not limited to the linear arrangement illustrated in the figures. Instead, the support elements 26 can be arranged in any fashion on the head 20.<br>
[0020] As illustrated in Figure 3, the first support member 30 is positioned at the first end 21 of the head 20. The body of this support member 30 includes a stem 32 and a support head 33. The stem 32 forms a smooth, continuous surface 16 with a portion 17 of the head 20 proximate the neck 14. The continuous surface 16 formed between the head 20 and the stem 32 is sized and shaped so it will be easily received and manipulated within the mouth. The continuous surface 16 provides a profile having a shape that is similar to that of a comfortable, conventional toothbrush head. Additionally, the soft material used to form the stem 32 will deflect when it engages a portion of the user's mouth. As a result, the soft, flexible material of the stem 32 provides the user with additional comfort.<br>
[0021] The support head 33 has a greater diameter/width than the stem 32 that extends away from it toward the neck 14. The portion 35 of the support head 33 that overhangs the stem 32 creates a partial mushroom-shaped profile. This portion 35 is also movable relative to the stem 32 and the base 24, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 3. The overhanging portion 35 has a lower surface 36 spaced from the base 24 by a distance 38. As shown, a channel 39 is formed between the lower surface 36 and the base 24. The distance 38 is greater than the distance 37 that the overhanging portion 35 extends beyond the stem 32 in the direction of the second end 22. The distance 38 allows the overhanging portion 35 to deflect toward the base 24.<br>
[0022] The flexion control member 31 within the stem 32 limits the total deflection of the support member 30 and cooperates with the material of the stern to return the stem 32 and its carrier 25 to their original, rest position. This deflection and return movement of the stem 32 and its carrier 25 allow the cleaning elements 50 to<br><br>
follow the teeth during cleaning and create an enhanced cleaning action within the mouth of the user. In an alternative embodiment, the distance 38 could be shorter than the distance 37. In such an embodiment, the base 24 could limit the travel of the overhanging portion 35. Regardless of the distance 38, the support member 30 is capable of achieving 360 degrees of movement relative to its central longitudinal axis.<br>
[0023] The second end 22 of the head 20 also includes the second cleaning element support member 40 that forms a continuous smooth surface 41 with the free end of the base 24 at the second end 22 of the toothbrush 10. The continuous surface 41 is sized and shaped so it will be easily received and manipulated within the mouth of the user. As shown, the second end 22 has a convexly curved profile that is similar to some comfortable, conventional toothbrush heads. This convex curve allows the end of the toothbrush 10 to be easily and comfortably received within the user's mouth during brushing. Additionally, the soft material used to form the stem 42 will deflect when it engages a portion of the user's mouth. As a result, the soft, flexible material of the stem 42 provides the user with additional comfort.<br>
[0024] The body of this support member 40 includes the stem 42 that carries a support head 43 and a flexion control member 41. The support head 43 has a greater diameter/width than the stem 42 and forms a partial mushroom-like shape, as illustrated. The portion 45 of the support head 43 that overhangs the stem 42 is similar 10 overhanging portion 35. The overhanging portion 45 is movable relative to the base 24 and includes a lower surface 46 that is spaced from the base 24 by a distance 48. As shown, a channel 49 is formed between the lower surface 46 and the base 24. The distance 48 is less than a distance 47 that the overhanging portion 45 extends beyond the stem 42 in the direction of the first end 21. Alternatively, the distance 48 could be greater than the distance 47, as discussed above with respect to support member 30. The distance 48 allows the overhanging portion 45 to deflect toward the base 24 and provide the same cleaning benefits discussed above with respect to the first support element 30. Additionally, the support member 40 is capable of achieving 360 degrees of movement relative to it central longitudinal axis.<br><br>
[0025] As shown in Figure 3, the head 14 also includes at least one intermediate support member 60 positioned between the support members 30, 40. The total number of intermediate support members 60 can vary based on their size, the size of the base 24 and the distance between the support members 30, 40. As with the other support members 30, 40, the intermediate support member 60 includes a flexion control member 61, a flexible stem 62, and a flexible support head 63 that receives a carrier 25.<br>
[0026] As shown in Figure 3, the support member 60 has a substantially mushroom-like shape. A lower surface 64 of the support head 63 is spaced from the base 24 by a distance 68 that is less than its length 67 from the stem 62. Nevertheless, the distance 68 is sufficient to permit the flexible support head 63 to deflect in any direction toward the base 24. In an alternative embodiment, the length 67 can be less than the distance 68 so that the base 24 cooperates to control the total deflection of the stem 62. Due to its shape and materials, the intermediate support member 60 can deflect in any direction. The support head 63 is capable of flexing in the direction of the first end 21, the second end 22 and/or the sidewalls of the head 20. As a result, the resilient intermediate support member 60 is capable of moving in all directions to provide enhanced cleaning to the teeth of the user.<br>
[0027] While only a few toothbrush variations are disclosed herein, the invention could be used in toothbrushes having many variations in, for example, the head, handle, and materials used. Additionally, the toothbrush could be a powered toothbrush. The head 20 can also be removably secured to the handle 12 whether it is powered or manual. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
