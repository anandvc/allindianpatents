DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a pyrimidinylacetic acid derivative which is useful as an active ingredient of. pharmaceutical preparations. The pyrimidinylacetic acid derivative of the present invention has CRTH2 (G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor, expressed on Th2 cells) antagonistic activity and can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases associated with CRTH2 activity, in particular for the treatment of allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis; eosinophil-related diseases, such as Churg-Strauss syndrome and sinusitis; basophil-related diseases, such as basophilic leukemia, chronic urticaria and basophilic leukocytosis in human and other mammals; and inflammatory diseases characterized by T lymphocytes and profuse leukocyte infiltrates such as psoriasis, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) and arthritis.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
CRTH2 is a G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor, expressed on Th2 cells (Nagata et al. J. Immunol, 162, 1278-1286, 1999), eosinophils and basophils (Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193, 255-261,2001).<br>
Th2-polarization has been seen in allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis (Romagnani S. Immunology Today, 18, 263-266, 1997; Hammad H. et al., Blood, 98, 1135-1141, 2001). Th2 cells regulate allergic diseases by producing Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Oriss et aL, J. Immunol., 162, 1999-2007, 1999; Viola et al., Blood, 91, 2223-2230, 1998; Webb et al., J. Immunol., 165, 108-113, 2000; Dumont F.J., Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat., 12, 341-367, 2002). These Th2 cytokines directly or indirectly induce migration, activation, priming and prolonged survival of effector cells, such as eosinophils and basophils, in allergic diseases (Sanz et al., J. Immunol., 160, 5637-5645, 1998; Pope et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 108, 594-601, 2001; Teran L.M., Clin. Exp. Allergy, 29, 287-290, 1999).<br>
PGD2) a ligand for CRTH2, is produced from mast cells and other important effector cells in allergic diseases (Nagata et al., FEBS Lett. 459, 195-199, 1999; Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193, 255-261, 2001). PGD2 induces migration and activation of Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils, in human cells via CRTH2 (Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193, 255-261, 2001; Gervais et al., J. Allergy<br><br>
Clin. Immunol, 108, 982-988, 2001; Sugimoto et al., J. Phannacol. Exp. Ther., 305, (1), 347-52, 2003).<br>
Therefore; antagonists which inhibit the binding of CRTH2 and PGD2 should be useful for the treatment of allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis.<br>
In addition, several lines of experimental evidence have demonstrated the contribution of eosinophils in sinusitis (Hamilos et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell and Mol. Biol., 15, 443-450, 1996; Fan et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 106, 551-558, 2000), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (Coffin et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 101, 116-123, 1998; Kurosawa et al., Allergy, 55, 785-787, 2000). In the tissues of these patients, mast cells can be observed to be colocalized with eosinophils (Khan et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 106, 1096-1101, 2000). It is suggested that PGD2 production from mast cells induces the recruitment of eosinophils. Therefore, CRTH2 antagonists are also useful for the treatment of other eosinophil-related diseases such as Churg-Strauss syndrome and sinusitis. CRTH2 antagonists can also be useful for the treatment of some basophil-related diseases such as basophilic leukemia, chronic urticaria and basophilic leukocytosis, because of high expression of CRTH2 on basophils.<br>
A. F. Kluge discloses the synthesis of imidazo[l,2-c]pyrimidine analog represented by the general<br><br>
(Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry (1978), 15(1), 119-21).<br>

The human CRTH2 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEAK. This expression plasmid (40 μg) was transfected into LI .2 cells, at a cell density of lxl07 cells/500 μl, by using electroporation<br><br>
apparatus (Gene Pulser II, BioRad) at 250V/1,000 μf. One day after the transfection, puromycin '(1 P-g/ml, Sigma) was added into the cell culture plates. Two weeks after the transfection, grown cells were picked up for further growth.<br>

CRTH2 transfectants were washed once with PBS and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCi, pH7.4, 40 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3). 100 μl of cell suspension (2 x 105 cells), [3H]-labeled PGD2, and various concentrations of test compound were then mixed in a 96-well U-bottom polypropylene plate and' incubated for 60 min at room temperature to allow binding to occur. After incubation, the cell suspension was transferred to a filtration plate (#MAFB, Millipore) and washed 3 times with binding buffer. Scintillant was added to the filtration plate, and radioactivity remaining on the filter was measured by TopCount (Packard), a scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was determined by incubating the cell suspension and [3H]-labeled PGD2 in the presence of 1μM of unlabeled PGD2.

The crude product was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel, chloroform: methanol, 19:1) to give methyl (5-{4-[(3,4-dichloro-benzoyl)amino]benzyl}imidazo[l,2-c]pyrimidin-8-yl)acetate (29 mg, 70%) as slightly yellow oil.<br>
Example 2-2<br><br>
To a solution of methyl (5-{4-[(3,4-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]benzyl}imidazo[l,2-c]pyrimidin-8-yI)-acetate (25 mg, 0.05 mmol) in methanol (1 mL) was added 1M NaOH aqueous solution (0.2 mL) at<br><br>
room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. After the removal of methanol under reduced pressure, water was added to the residue. The solution was washed with diethyl ether and neutralized by aqueous hydrochloric acid. The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to give (5-{4-[(3,4-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]benzyl}imidazo[l,2-c]pyrimidin-8-yl)acetic acid (17.2 mg3 71%) as slightly yellow solid.<br>
