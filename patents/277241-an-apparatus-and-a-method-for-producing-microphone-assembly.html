				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FABRICATING MICROPHONE ASSEMBLY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001] The present invention relates to a microphone assembly<br>
of a microphone, and more particularly, to an apparatus and<br>
method for fabricating a microphone assembly, which can<br>
reduce processing time required for fabricating a microphone<br>
and fabricate high quality microphone by fabricating the<br>
microphone assembly in a transfer molding process or an<br>
injection molding process.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[002] Generally, a microphone assembly for an electret<br>
	condenser microphone and a digital microphone is<br>
	fabricated by mounting a plurality of microphone<br>
	chips on a printed circuit board (PCB) and then<br>
	individually cutting the mounted microphone chips.<br>
[003]	Referring to FIGs. 1 and 2, a microphone assembly<br>
	includes a plurality of microphone chips 200<br>
	arranged on a PCB 100 and spaced apart from one<br>
	another by predetermined distances.<br>
[004]	Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the microphone chips 200<br>
	having a predetermined shape, a predetermined area<br>
	D, and a predetermined height H are fixed to the PCB<br>
	100.<br>
[005]	The microphone chips 200 fixed to the PCB 100 are<br>
	encapsulated using silicon or epoxy. A method for<br>
	fabricating a typical microphone chip 200 will be<br>
	described below with reference to FIG. 5. A<br>
	material injector 300 is installed above the<br>
	microphone chips 200 fixed to the PCB 100. The<br>
	material injector 300 provides epoxy E toward the<br>
	microphone chip 200 through an air pressure. In<br>
-1A<br>
 <br>
this way, an encapsulation or molding process of the<br>
microphone assembly is carried out.<br>
[006] Accordingly, the microphone assembly has the<br>
predetermined height H (see FIG. 5), a predetermined<br>
shape, and a predetermined area D (see FIG. 6).<br>
[007] In the typical microphone assembly, it is difficult<br>
to adjust the shape and height of the molding<br>
according to characteristics of the injected silicon<br>
or epoxy E. Therefore, it is difficult to produce<br>
products at a uniform quality. Furthermore, it is<br>
difficult to realize various shapes of the<br>
microphone assembly by only injection of the epoxy<br>
E.<br>
[008] In the molding process of the typical microphone<br>
assembly, since precision of the molding size is<br>
lowered, it is difficult to secure a back-chamber of<br>
the microphone. Therefore, quality of the<br>
microphone is degraded and a change of sensitivity<br>
is difficult. In addition, since the process of<br>
molding the microphone chips is complicated,<br>
processing time required for fabricating the<br>
microphone increases, leading to reduction of<br>
productivity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[009] Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an<br>
	apparatus and method for fabricating a microphone<br>
	assembly that substantially obviate one or more<br>
	problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
	related art.<br>
[0010] An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
	microphone assembly fabricated in a transfer molding<br>
	process or an injection molding process to reduce<br>
	the processing time required for fabricating the<br>
	microphone, fabricate high quality microphone due to<br>
	improvement of the workability and productivity, and<br>
	obtain the required back-chamber by changing the<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
shape of the microphone, thereby changing<br>
sensitivity of the microphone.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0034]	Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
		preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
		examples of which are illustrated in the<br>
		accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same<br>
		reference numbers will be used throughout the<br>
		drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[0035]	Referring to FIGs. 7 and 8, a microphone assembly<br>
		for an electret condenser microphone (ECM) and a<br>
		digital microphone is fabricated by an apparatus<br>
		using a mold. The apparatus for fabricating the<br>
		microphone assembly includes a lower mold 10, an<br>
		upper mold 20, and a material injector 30.<br>
[0036]	The lower mold 10 is attached to a bottom surface of<br>
		a printed circuit board (PCB) 50, where a microphone<br>
		chip 40 is mounted, and supports the PCB 50. The<br>
		upper mold 20 is installed on the PCB 50 and<br>
		includes a receiving space 21 and an inlet 22. The<br>
		receiving space 21 for receiving the microphone chip<br>
		40 is formed at lower portion of the upper mold 20.<br>
		The inlet for injecting the material is formed at<br>
		upper portion of the upper mold 20.<br>
[0037]	The material injector 30 is formed movably up and<br>
		down with respect to the inlet 22 of the upper mold<br>
		20 to inject the material such as epoxy E or silicon<br>
		into the receiving space 21 of the upper mold 20.<br>
-6-<br>
 <br>
[0038]	The fabricating apparatus injects the material into<br>
the upper mold 20 by a high temperature and a<br>
pressure of the material to form a mold around the<br>
microphone chip 40.<br>
[0039]	The fabricating apparatus has various features in<br>
the upper mold 20. The upper mold 20 is attached to<br>
the PCB 50 and the receiving space 21 covers the<br>
outside of the microphone chip 40 to form an<br>
independent individual space. The material is<br>
injected into the receiving space having one<br>
microphone chip 40.<br>
[0040]	The receiving space 21 of the upper mold 21 is<br>
		formed in various shapes, for example, square,<br>
		rectangular, trapezium, etc. Hence, the mold of the<br>
		fabricated microphone assembly is formed in various<br>
		shapes to easily change a shape of the microphone.<br>
[0041]	Accordingly, the required back-chamber is obtained<br>
by changing the shape of the microphone to allow the<br>
microphone to change the sensitivity.<br>
[0042]	Referring to FIG. 9, a fabricating apparatus<br>
includes a lower mold 10, an upper mold 20, and a<br>
PCB 50. A lower portion of the upper mold 20 has a<br>
continuous concave-convex shape to form a plurality<br>
of receiving spaces 21 on the PCB 50. The receiving<br>
spaces 21 are connected to each other, and<br>
microphone chips 40 arranged in series are received<br>
in the receiving spaces 21, respectively.<br>
[0043]	Material channels 24 are formed between a lower<br>
portion of protrusion portions 23 of the upper mold<br>
20 and the PCB 50. An inlet 22 is formed at one<br>
side of a front end of the material channels 24 .<br>
The material injected into the inlet 22 flows along<br>
the material channels 24 to mold the microphone<br>
chips 40 in order.<br>
[0044]	The upper mold 20 of the fabricating apparatus can<br>
have various locations and shapes of the inlet 22<br>
-7-<br>
 <br>
and the material channels 24 according to a kind of<br>
appliance to be fabricated.<br>
[0045]	The method for fabricating the microphone assembly<br>
will be described below with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
The method includes: (s10) mounting a microphone<br>
chip; (S20) installing a mold; (S30) injecting a<br>
material; and (S40) cutting a PCB and producing the<br>
microphone assembly.<br>
[0046]	More specifically, in operation S10, a plurality of<br>
		microphone chips are mounted on the PCB having a<br>
		predetermined width and arranged spaced apart from<br>
		one another by predetermined distances. In<br>
		operation S20, a lower mold is attached to a bottom<br>
		surface of the PCB and an upper mold is installed on<br>
		the PCB. A receiving space of the upper mold<br>
		receives the microphone chip mounted on the PCB.<br>
		The upper mold is disposed such that a material is<br>
		injected around the received microphone chip. In<br>
		operation S30, the material is injected through an<br>
		inlet of the upper mold using a material injector<br>
		filled with one of epoxy and silicon to mold the<br>
		microphone chip by filling the material within the<br>
		receiving space of the upper mold. In operation<br>
		S40, the PCB on which cured moldings are mounted is<br>
		cut into individual microphone chip unit to<br>
		fabricate the microphone assembly.<br>
[0047]	In operation S20 of installing the mold, the upper<br>
		mold is attached to the PCB and the receiving space<br>
		of the upper mold covers the outside of the<br>
		microphone chip to form an independent individual<br>
		space. In operation S30 of injecting the material,<br>
		the material injector is installed in a vertical<br>
		direction with respect to the upper mold to inject<br>
		the material in a vertical downward direction<br>
		through the inlet. The receiving space of the upper<br>
-8-<br>
 <br>
		mold is filled with the injected material to mold<br>
		the microphone chip.<br>
[0048]	As another embodiment, in operation S20, the upper<br>
		mold is formed in a continuous concave-convex shape<br>
		to form a plurality of receiving spaces. The<br>
		receiving spaces are connected to each other, and<br>
		microphone chips are received in the receiving<br>
		spaces, respectively. In operation S30 of injecting<br>
		the material, the material injector is horizontally<br>
		installed at one side of a front end of the upper<br>
		mold. The material is injected through the inlet<br>
		formed at one side of a front end in a lateral<br>
		direction to mold the microphone chips in order.<br>
[0049]	Therefore, the microphone is more easily fabricated<br>
		through the apparatus and method for fabricating the<br>
		microphone assembly, thereby improving workability<br>
		and productivity and producing high quality<br>
		microphone.<br>
[0050]	As described above, in the apparatus and method for<br>
		fabricating the microphone assembly according to the<br>
		present invention, the microphone assembly is<br>
		fabricated in a transfer molding process or an<br>
		injection molding process using a mold to reduce the<br>
		processing time required for fabricating the<br>
		microphone and fabricate high quality microphone due<br>
		to improvement of the workability and productivity.<br>
		Therefore, the mold of the fabricated microphone<br>
		assembly is formed in various shapes to easily<br>
		change a shape of the microphone. Accordingly, the<br>
		required back-chamber is obtained by changing the<br>
		shape of the microphone to allow the microphone to<br>
		change the sensitivity.<br>
[0051]	It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
		various modifications and variations can be made in<br>
		the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
		present invention covers the modifications and<br>
-9-<br>

<br>
A microphone assembly is provided. An apparatus for<br>
fabricating the microphone assembly includes a lower mold<br>
attached to a bottom surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) on<br>
which a microphone chip is mounted, an upper mold installed on<br>
the PCB and including receiving spaces receiving the microphone<br>
chips and an inlet for injecting a material; and a material<br>
injector movably installed with respect to the inlet to inject<br>
epoxy or silicon into the receiving spaces of the upper mold. A<br>
method for fabricating the microphone phone includes mounting<br>
microphone chips, installing the mold, injecting the material,<br>
and cutting the PCB and producing the microphone assembly. The<br>
microphone assembly is fabricated in a transfer molding process<br>
or an injection molding process using a mold to reduce the<br>
processing time required for fabricating the microphone and<br>
fabricate high quality microphone due to improvement of the<br>
workability and productivity. In addition, the required back-<br>
chamber is obtained by changing the shape of the microphone to<br>
allow the microphone to change the sensitivity.<br>
