[Detailed Description  of   the  Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a body frame for a motorcycle, and particularly to a body frame suitable for a scooter-type vehicle. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
As known typically from Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. Hei 1-311975 and Hei 7-156852, a body frame for a motorcycle is generally, integrally formed by welding steel pipes or by casting a metal material. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described integrally formed body frame in the prior art has the following problem: namely, since it is difficult to convert part of the body frame to the   corresponding part of a body frame of a different motorcycle because of the limitation in size and an external shape of the body frame, the body frame must be designed for each kind of motorcycle.  In particular, where the body frame is formed by casting, a mold used for casting must be changed for every kind of motorcycle, with a result that it takes a lot of cost to design and produce a body frame.  Further, since the body frame is integrally formed, a plurality of parts are sequentially mounted to the body frame upon assembly of a motorcycle.<br><br><br>
As a result, an assembling efficiency becomes low. [0004]<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide a body frame for a motorcycle, which is capable of converting, upon partial change of a different body frame, part of the body frame to the corresponding part of the different body frame thereby reducing the design and production costs, and also improving an assembling efficiency of the motorcycle. [0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a body frame for a motorcycle, including a first frame, a second frame, and a third frame, those are fastened to each other, wherein at least one of the first, second, and third frames is produced by die-forming. [0006]<br>
With this configuration, since at least one of the first, second and third frames constituting the body frame is produced by die-forming, such a frame can be shared/converted among various kinds of motorcycles made different from each other by changing part of each body frame, with a result that it is possible to reduce the<br><br><br>
design and production costs of a body frame due to the model change of body frame. Further, since each of the first, second and third frames can be modularized, a motorcycle can be assembled by mounting parts to each modularized frame and then assembling these three modules having been sub-assembled to each other. As a result, it is possible to improve the assembling efficiency of the motorcycle.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a body frame for a motorcycle, including a first frame, a second frame and a third frame,<br>
a second frame is fastened to a first frame by means of bolts and nuts, a third frame is fastened to a second frame by means of bolts and nuts,<br>
said first frame is formed by casting and integrally has a head pipe for steerably supporting a front wheel (WR), down frame extending rearwardly, downwardly from said head pipe, and floor supporting frames extending rearwardly from the lower end of said down frame and disposed under a step floor;<br>
said second frame, which swingably supports a power unit (P) and is connected to the upper end of a rear cushion, is formed by casting and is fastened to the rear ends of said floor supporting frames.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to reduce<br><br><br>
the design and production costs due to the model change of body frame of the scooter-type motorcycle and to improve the assembling efficiency of the motorcycle. Also, since each of the first and second frames as main portions of the body frame of the scooter-type motorcycle is formed by casting, it is possible to further reduce the design and product costs by sharing either the first frame or the second frame among various kinds of scooter-type motorcycles. The third frame at the rear portion of the body frame, which is relatively low in design and production costs, can be easily formed by working metal pipes in accordance with the model change of body frame of the motorcycle.

[0058]<br>
The function of this embodiment will be described below.  The body frame F of the scooter-type vehicle is formed by fastening the front frame 23, rear frame 24, and sub-frame 22 to each other. At least one of the frames 23, 24 and 22 is formed by casting (the front frame 23 and rear frame 24 are formed by casting in this embodiment).  Accordingly, by commonly using either the front frame 23 or the rear frame 24 to various kinds of motorcycles different in part of the body frames, it is possible to reduce the design and manufacturing costs of the body frame required for change in kind of the motorcycle.  Further, since it is possible to modularize the frames 23, 24 and 22 and perform the assembly of parts for each of the frames 23, 24 and 22, and hence to manufacture a scooter-type motorcycle by assembling the three modules having been sub-assembled to each other, and hence to improve the assembling efficiency in the process of manufacturing the scooter-type motorcycle.<br>
[0059]<br>
The front frame 23 including the head pipe 25, down frame 26, and floor supporting frames 272 and 271   is<br><br>
integrally formed by casting; the rear frame 24 formed by casting are fastened to the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271; and the sub-frame 22 formed by welding the metal pipes is fastened to the rear end of the rear frame 24. Accordingly, the sub-frame 22 relatively low in design and manufacturing costs is allowed to easily keep up with the change in any kind of the motorcycle by changing the metal pipes to be welded. [0060]<br>
The rear frame 24 is fastened to the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 211  of the front frame 23 by overlapping and fastening the rear fastening plates 6l2 and 611 provided at the branched front ends of the rear frame 24 to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 provided at the rear ends of the floor supporting   frames 272 and 271.  Each of the front fastening plates 562 and 561 and the rear fastening plates 612 and 61: is, as shown in Fig. 24(a), formed into a shape tilted forwardly, downwardly. Accordingly, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 56l 6l2 and 611 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 24(b), the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 561 612 and 611 are disposed at positions relatively close to the head pipe 25. With this configuration, as shown in Fig. 24(b), even if there<br><br><br>
occurs an error in assembling the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 on the rear frame 24 side to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 on the front frame 23 side and thereby the position of the head pipe 25 is tilted from the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction.  Thus, it is possible to make relatively small displacement amounts l   and 2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction, and hence to improve the positioning accuracy of the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR to the vehicular body.<br>
[0061]<br>
Further, the extension line L of the axial line of at least one the pairs of bolts 64 for fastening the front fastening plates 562 and 561 to the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 (the extension lines L of the axial lines of the pair of bolts 64 in this embodiment) is set to pass through the space between the upper end of the steering handlebar 32 supported by the head pipe 25 and the axle 31 of the front wheel WF, so that the above fastening planes are disposed at positions closer to the head pipe 25.  As a result, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, it is possible to make small the displacement amounts 1  and<br>
2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to<br><br>
the center line c of the rear frame 24 in the width direction.<br>
[0062]<br>
On the contrary, if the fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 are not tilted forwardly, downwardly as shown in Fig. 25(a), but extend substantially in the horizontal direction, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the above fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 25(b), the fastening planes are disposed at positions relatively apart from the head pipe 25. As a result, when there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, the displacement amounts l and 2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction becomes relatively large.<br>
[0063]<br>
Since the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 are overlapped from below to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 a space for disposing the rear frame 24 over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271  is not required to be ensured.  As a result, it is possible to allow the step floor 41b to extend up to a position<br><br>
over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 and hence to make large the space of the step floor 41b. [0064]<br>
Since the fitting recesses 58 are provided in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 and the fitting projections 63 to be fitted in the fitting recesses 58 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to improve the assembling accuracy in fastening and assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23. [0065]<br>
Further, since three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting recesses 58 are formed in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 273 and 271 and three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting projections 63 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to further improve the accuracy in assembling the rear frame 24- to the front frame 23. [0066]<br>
Since the down frame 26 of the front frame 23 is formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, downwardly, the front wheel WF is allowed to be closer to the down frame 26 without reducing the cross - sectional shape of<br><br>
the down frame 26. Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the length of the wheel base while avoiding interference between the front wheel WF and the down frame 26, and sufficiently ensuring the space of the step floor 41b.<br>
[0067]<br>
Since the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are each formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 211  are deflected in such a manner that the areas of the upper opening portions thereof are changed.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort.<br>
[0068]<br>
Since the ribs 52 extending in the longitudinal direction are provided on the floor supporting frames 272 and 271, when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 271  are allowed to be deflected with their rigidities not reduced so much.<br>
[0069]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are disposed on both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, the step floor 41b can be disposed in such a manner as to extend up to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, and hence to sufficiently<br><br><br>
ensure the space of the step floor 41b on the front side without enlarging the wheel base.<br>
[0070]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are connected to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26 via the pair of curved portions 502 and 501 expanded forwardly from the front surface of the lower end of the down frame 26, the connection portions between the down frame 26 and the floor supporting frames 272 and 211  are expanded forwardly as the curved portions 502 and 501 although the front ends of the pair of floor supporting frames 272 and 271 extending in line are disposed at the connection portions.  As a result, it is possible to sufficiently increase the strength of the connection portions.<br>
[0071]<br>
In addition, the front wheel WF can be disposed close to the curved portions 502 and 501 side while ensuring a gap between the front wheel WF and the curved portions 502 and 501 by providing the recesses 51 on the opposed inner sides 6£   the curved portions 502 and 501 so that it is possible to avoid an inconvenience that the wheel base is enlarged by the fact that the front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 211   are connected to the down frame 26 via the curved portions 502 and 501<br><br>
[0072]<br>
With respect to the vibration-proof link 66 for swingably supporting the engine E of the power unit P on the body frame F, the pair of right and left links 682 and 681 are provided for swingably connecting the pair of right and left engine side brackets 672 and 671  provided on the engine E to the body frame F, and the cross-member 69 is provided for connecting the right and left links 682 and 681 to each other.  The cross-member 69 is formed into the approximately U-shape opened downwardly, and is disposed at a position astride the intake pipe 83 for connecting the carburetor 35 disposed behind the links 682 and 681 to the engine E on the front side of the links 682 and 681.  Accordingly, as compared with a structure in which the carburetor 35 is disposed in front of the links 682 and 681 the degree of freedom in arrangement of the carburetor 35 becomes larger. [0073]<br>
Further, since the engine E is a four-cycle engine disposed substantially in the horizontal direction and the cross-member 69 is disposed between the luggage box 39 mounted on the body frame F under the seat 42 and the engine E, it is possible to prevent the position of the seat 42 from becoming higher in the case of ensuring the free motion of the cross-member 69 while avoiding the<br><br><br>
interference with the luggage box 39.<br>
[0074]<br>
Since the opening portion 87 allowing the cushion side bracket 86 provided at the upper end of the rear cushion unit 33 to pass therethrough is provided in the frame main portion 24a of the rear portion of the main frame 21 of the body frame F; the cushion mounting portion 88 raised upwardly from the frame main portion 24a while crossing the opening portion 87 is mounted on the frame main portion 24a; and the cushion side bracket 86 is mounted on the cushion mounting portion 88, it is possible to set the cushion side bracket 86 at a high position, and hence to make larger the stroke of the rear cushion unit 33.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort.<br>
[0075]<br>
Since the sub-frame 22 constituting the body frame F in co-operation of the main frame 21 is fastened to the main frame 21 at a position near the connection portion between the cushion mounting portion 88 and the frame main portion 24a, it is possible to reinforce the strength of the cushion mounting portion 88 raised from the frame main portion 24a by the sub-frame 22.<br>
[0076]<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has<br><br>
been described, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment, and it is to be understood that many changes in design may be made without departing the scope of the claims. [00771<br>
For example, the front frame 23 and the rear frame 24 are formed by casting in the above embodiment; however, the present invention can be applied to the case in which the front frame 23 and the rear frame 24 are formed from a synthetic resin by molding. [0078]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention described in claim 1, since at least one of the first, second and third frames is produced by die-forming, such a frame can be shared among various kinds of motorcycles made different from each other by changing part of each body frame, with a result that it is possible to reduce the design and production costs of a body frame due to the model change of body frame.  Further, since each of the first, second and third frames can be modularized, a motorcycle can be assembled by mounting parts to each modularized frame and then assembling these three modules having been sub.assembled to each other.  As a result, it is possible to improve the assembling efficiency of the<br><br>
motorcycle. [0079]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, it is possible to reduce the design and production costs due to the model change of body frame of the scooter-type motorcycle and to improve the assembling efficiency of the motorcycle.  Also, since each of the first and second frames as main portions of the body frame of the scooter-type motorcycle is formed by casting, it is possible to further reduce the design and product costs by sharing/converting either the first frame or the second frame among various kinds of scooter-type motorcycles. The third frame at the rear portion of the body frame, which is relatively low in design and production costs, can be easily formed by working metal pipes in accordance' with the model change of body frame of the motorcycle.<br>
