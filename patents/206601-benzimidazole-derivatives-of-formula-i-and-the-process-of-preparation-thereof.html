Intermediates for the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives and a process for the preparation thereof<br>
[Technical field]<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of benzimidazole derivatives<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof exhibiting excellent hypoglycemic	<br>
action and intermediates for their synthesis.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
Some benzimidazole derivatives having hypoglycemic activity and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a process for the preparation of these derivatives are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication Hei-9-295970 (European Patent Application Publication number 00745600).<br>
The known method for the preparation of the benzimidazole derivatives comprises:<br>
1)	protection of the amino group of a nitroaniline derivative,<br><br>
(wherein A is an amino protecting group, R is methoxy and the like);<br>
2)	a few reactions via the amino-protected nitroaniline derivative to afford an N-<br>
methyl-l,2-phenylenediamine derivative, and<br>
3)	reaction of the N-methyl-l,2-phenylenediamine derivative by heating with a<br>
methoxycarbonylmethyloxybenzylthiazolidinone derivative in the presence of an acid<br>
to produce a benzimidazole derivative shown below.<br><br>
2<br><br>
(wherein R is methoxy and the like)<br>
In the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication Hei-9-295970. the overall yields of the benzimidazole derivatives, especially the two reactions shown above, are low and this method can not practically be used. A practical large scale method for the synthesis of the benzimidazole derivatives is needed, in which method the product is of good purity and is obtained by easy procedures using cheap starting materials, and in good yield.<br>
[Disclosure of the invention] [Subject of the invention]<br>
