				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a direct reduction apparatus and process for a metalli-<br>
ferous feed material, particularly, although by no means exclusively, to the direct reduc-<br>
tion of an iron-containing feed material, such as iron ore.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for reducing a metalliferous feed mate-<br>
rial that comprises a direct reduction process for partially reducing metalliferous feed<br>
material in the solid state and a smelting process for melting and further reducing the<br>
partially reduced metalliferous feed material to a molten metal.<br>
The present invention was made during the course of an on-going research project car-<br>
ried out by the applicant to develop so called "CIRCOFER" technology for the direct<br>
reduction of iron ore.<br>
CIRCOFER technology is a direct reduction process that is capable of reducing iron ore<br>
in the solid state to a metallisation of 50% or higher.<br>
CIRCOFER technology is based on the use of fluidised beds. The main feed materials<br>
to the fluidised beds are fluidising gas, metal oxides (typically iron ore fines), solid car-<br>
bonaceous material (typically coal) and oxygen-containing gas (typically oxygen gas).<br>
The main product produced in the fluidised beds is metallised metal oxides, i.e. metal<br>
oxides that have been at least partially reduced.<br>
One of the findings of the applicant in the research project is that it is possible to mini-<br>
mise accretions within the fluidised beds and particularly on oxygen-containing gas in-<br>
jection lances by positioning the lances to inject oxygen-containing gas downwardly in<br>
the fluidised beds.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for reducing a metal-<br>
liferous material in a fluidised bed which comprises a vessel for containing the fluidised<br><br>
bed, a means for supplying the metalliferous material, a solid carbonaceous material,<br>
an oxygen-containing gas, and a fluidising gas into the vessel for forming the fluidised<br>
bed in the vessel, which apparatus is characterised in that the oxygen-containing gas<br>
supply means comprises one or more than one oxygen-containing gas injection lance<br>
having a lance tip with an outlet that is positioned for injecting the oxygen-containing<br>
gas in a downward flow into the vessel within a range of plus or minus 40 degrees to<br>
the vertical.<br>
Preferably the lance tip is positioned for injecting the oxygen-containing gas in a down-<br>
ward flow in the vessel within a range of plus or minus 15 degrees to the vertical.<br>
Preferably the lance tip is directed downwardly.<br>
More preferably the lance tip is directed vertically downwardly.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-containing gas injection lance is water-cooled.<br>
Preferably at least the lance tip comprises an outer water-cooled jacket.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-containing gas injection lance comprises a central pipe for the<br>
oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the lance tip comprises a passageway located outwardly of the central pipe<br>
for injecting shrouding gas to reduce the possibility of accretions forming on the lance<br>
tip that could block the injection of the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the passageway for injecting the shrouding gas is an annulus in transverse<br>
section.<br>
Preferably the passageway is an annulus in transverse section located between the<br>
central pipe and the outer water-cooled jacket.<br><br>
Preferably a lower end of the central pipe is recessed relative to a lower end of the<br>
outer water-cooled jacket.<br>
Preferably the central pipe has a chamfer extending from an internal surface to an outer<br>
surface of the pipe.<br>
Preferably the lance is positioned so that the lance tip is in a central region of the ves-<br>
sel away from a side wall of the vessel.<br>
The position of the oxygen-containing gas injection lance and, more particularly, the<br>
height of the outlet end of the lance tip within the vessel, are determined by reference<br>
to factors, such as the oxygen-containing gas injection velocity, the vessel pressure,<br>
the selection and amounts of the other feed materials to the vessel, and the fluidised<br>
bed density.<br>
Preferably the lance extends downwardly through a top wall of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the lance extends vertically downwardly through the top wall of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the lance extends through the side wall of the vessel and then downwardly.<br>
Preferably the lance extends horizontally through the side wall of the vessel and then<br>
downwardly.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for reducing a metallifer-<br>
ous material in a fluidised bed in a vessel which comprises supplying a metalliferous<br>
material, a solid carbonaceous material, an oxygen-containing gas, and a fluidising gas<br>
into the fluidised bed and maintaining the fluidised bed in the vessel, at least partially<br>
reducing metalliferous material in the vessel, and discharging a product stream that<br>
comprises the at least partially reduced metalliferous material from the vessel and a<br>
separate off-gas stream, which process is characterised by injecting the oxygen-<br>
containing gas into the vessel with a downward flow in a range of plus or minus 40 de-<br>
grees to the vertical via one or more than one lance.<br><br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas into a central<br>
region in the vessel, i.e. a region that is located inwardly of the side wall of the vessel,<br>
via a lance having a downwardly directed lance tip positioned inwardly of the side wall<br>
of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises water-cooling the lance tip to reduce the possibility of<br>
accretions forming on the lance tip that could block the injection of the oxygen-<br>
containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen-containing gas with sufficient<br>
velocity to form a substantially solids-free zone in the region of the lance tip to de-<br>
crease the possibility of accretions forming on the lance tip that could block the injec-<br>
tion of the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the oxygen containing gas with a velocity in<br>
the range of 50-300 m/s.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting nitrogen and/or steam and/or other suitable<br>
shrouding gas and shrouding a lower end of the lance tip to minimise oxidation of metal<br>
that could result in accretions on the lance tip that could block the injection of the oxy-<br>
gen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises injecting the shrouding gas into the vessel at a veloc-<br>
ity that is at least 60% of the velocity of the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Preferably the process comprises supplying the metalliferous material, the solid carbo-<br>
naceous material, the oxygen-containing gas, and the fluidising gas into the fluidised<br>
bed and maintaining the fluidised bed with (a) a downward flow of the oxygen-<br>
containing gas, (b) an upward flow of solids and fluidising gas countercurrent to the<br>
downward flow of the oxygen-containing gas, and (c) a downward flow of solids out-<br>
wardly of the upward flow of solids and fluidising gas.<br><br>
In the fluidised bed described in the preceding paragraph, solids in the upward and<br>
downward flows of solids are heated by heat generated by reactions between the oxy-<br>
gen-containing gas and the carbonaceous material and other oxidisable materials (such<br>
as CO, volatiles, and H2) in a carbon-rich zone. The solids in the downward flow of<br>
solids transfer heat to a metal-rich zone in a lower part of the vessel.<br>
The term "carbon-rich" zone is understood herein to mean a region in the fluidised bed<br>
in which there is a relatively large amount of carbon-containing material in relation to<br>
the amount of metalliferous material than in other regions of the fluidised bed.<br>
The term "metal-rich" zone is understood herein to mean a region in the fluidised bed in<br>
which there is a relatively large amount of metalliferous material in relation to the<br>
amount of carbon-containing material than in other regions of the fluidised bed.<br>
In addition, the upward and downward flows of solids shield the side wall of the vessel<br>
from radiant heat generated by reactions between the oxygen-containing gas and the<br>
solid carbonaceous material and other oxidisable solids and gases in the fluidised bed.<br>
In the case of reducing metalliferous material in the form of iron ore fines, preferably<br>
the fines are sized at minus 6 mm.<br>
Preferably the fines have an average particle size in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 mm<br>
One of the advantages of the process is that it can accept a substantial amount of met-<br>
alliferous feed material with a particle size of less than 100 microns without a significant<br>
amount of this material exiting the process entrained in off-gas. This is believed to be<br>
due to an agglomeration mechanism operating within the fluidised bed that promotes a<br>
desirable level of agglomeration between particles of feed materials, particularly sub-<br>
100 micron particles, without appearing to promote uncontrolled agglomeration capable<br>
of interrupting operation of the fluidised bed. Similarly, friable ores that have a ten-<br>
dency to break down during processing and to thereby increase the proportion of parti-<br>
cles in the fluidised bed with a size of less than 100 microns may be processed without<br>
significant loss of feed material in process off-gas.<br><br>
Preferably the process comprises discharging the product stream comprising at least<br>
partially reduced metalliferous material from the lower section of the vessel.<br>
The product stream also comprises other solids (for example char).<br>
Preferably the process comprises separating at least a portion of the other solids from<br>
the product stream and returning the separated solids to the vessel.<br>
The off-gas stream discharged from the vessel contains entrained solids from the ves-<br>
sel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises separating entrained solids from the off-gas stream.<br>
Preferably the process comprises maintaining a circulating fluidised bed and returning<br>
entrained solids to a lower portion of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises preheating metalliferous feed material with the off-<br>
gas from the vessel.<br>
Preferably the process comprises treating the off-gas after the preheating step and re-<br>
turning at least a portion of the treated off-gas to the vessel as the fluidising gas.<br>
Preferably the off-gas treatment comprises one or more of (a) solids removal, (b) cool-<br>
ing, (c) H2O removal, (d) CO2 removal, (e) compression, and (f) reheating.<br>
Preferably the off-gas treatment comprises returning solids to vessel.<br>
The process may be carried out as a single stage process in a single vessel.<br>
The process may also be carried out as a multiple stage process in two or more ves-<br>
sels.<br><br>
Preferably the multiple stage process comprises a first stage in which heat is generated<br>
by reactions between solid carbonaceous material and oxygen-containing gas in a fluid-<br>
ised bed in a first vessel and metalliferous material is reduced in a fluidised bed in a<br>
second vessel, with heat being supplied in part to the second fluidised bed via a stream<br>
of hot off-gas and entrained solids from the first fluidised bed.<br>
Preferably oxygen-containing gas is also supplied to the second vessel.<br>
More preferably the introduction of oxygen containing gas supplied to the second ves-<br>
sel is performed under such controlled conditions that a desirable agglomeration of<br>
smaller reduced ore particles with other particles of feed material to form larger re-<br>
duced ore particles takes place.<br>
The above-described multiple stage process separates in part the heat generation and<br>
reduction functions of the process into two separate vessels and makes it possible to<br>
optimise each of these functions.<br>
The oxygen-containing gas may be any suitable gas.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-containing gas comprises at least 90% by volume oxygen.<br>
The present invention is described further with reference to the accompany drawings,<br>
of which:<br>
Figure 1	is a diagram of an embodiment of an apparatus for direct reduction of a<br>
metalliferous feed material in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 2	is a diagram that illustrates the lance tip region of the oxygen gas injec-<br>
tion lance shown in Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic illustration showing the lance tip region of Figure 2 in<br>
greater detail.<br><br>
Figure 4	is a diagram of another embodiment of an apparatus for direct reduction<br>
of a metalliferous feed material in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The following description is in the context of direct reduction of a metalliferous feed<br>
material in the form of iron ore particles in the solid state. The present invention is not<br>
so limited and extends to direct reduction of other iron-containing materials (such as<br>
ilmenite) and more generally to other metalliferous materials.<br>
The following description is also in the context of direct reduction of iron ore with coal<br>
as a solid carbonaceous material, oxygen as an oxygen-containing gas, and re-cycled<br>
off-gas as a fluidising gas. The present invention is not so limited and extends to the<br>
use of any other suitable solid carbonaceous material, oxygen-containing gas, or fluid-<br>
ising gas.<br>
With reference to the embodiment of the apparatus shown in Figure 1, solid feed mate-<br>
rials, namely iron ore fines and coal, oxygen and fluidising gas are introduced into a<br>
vessel 3 and establish a fluidised bed in the vessel.<br>
The solid feed materials are supplied to the vessel 3 via a solids delivery device 5 such<br>
as a screw feed or a solids injection lance that extends through a side wall 7 of the<br>
vessel.<br>
The fluidising gas is injected via a series of tuyeres or nozzles(not shown) in a base 13<br>
of the vessel.<br>
The oxygen is injected into the vessel via a lance 9 that has a downwardly extending<br>
lance tip 11 with an outlet 71 (Figure 2) that is positioned away from the side wall 7 of<br>
the vessel 3 and directs the oxygen downwardly in a central region 31 of the vessel.<br>
With reference to Figures 2 and 3, the lance tip 11 (and other sections of the lance 9<br>
that extend into the vessel 3) comprises a central pipe 73 for oxygen, an outer water-<br>
cooled jacket 75, and a passageway 77 having an annular transverse section for nitro-<br>
gen (or other suitable shrouding gas) between the central pipe 73 and the outer jacket<br><br>
75. As can best be seen in Figure 3, the central pipe 73 includes an internally located<br>
chamfer that extends from an internal wall of the pipe 73 to an external wall of the pipe<br>
and ends at a central pipe tip 174. The central pipe tip 174 is recessed relative to a<br>
lower end 176 of the water cooled jacket 75.<br>
The above-described position of the lance tip 11 within the vessel 3 and the construc-<br>
tion of the lance tip 11 are designed to minimise accretions forming on the lance tip 11<br>
and in particular minimise accretions forming on the central pipe 73 that could block the<br>
outlet 71 and thereby interfere with efficient operation of the lance 9.<br>
Specifically, positioning the lance tip 11 in a central region of the vessel, away from the<br>
side wall 7, minimises the possibility of the formation of accretions on the lance tip 11<br>
and on the side wall 7. In addition, positioning the lance tip 11 so that it extends<br>
downwardly minimises the possibility of accretions adhering to the surface of the lance<br>
tip 11. In addition, the water-cooled jacket 75 maintains the outer surface of the lance<br>
tip 11 at a temperature that minimises accretions adhering to the lance tip 11. In addi-<br>
tion, injecting the annular stream of the shrouding gas minimises reactions between<br>
solids and oxygen that could result in the formation of accretions on the lance tip. In<br>
addition, the internally located chamfer in the central pipe 73 minimises the possibility<br>
of the formation of accretions on the lance tip. The chamfer is understood to create a<br>
region of low pressure internally of the central pipe and adjacent the central pipe tip<br>
174. This low pressure region is understood to draw shrouding gas across the central<br>
pipe tip 174. In this way the central pipe tip 174 is shrouded by shrouding gas. This<br>
prevents contact of particles with the central pipe tip 174 in the presence of oxygen.<br>
Contact under such conditions is believed to form accretions.<br>
The outer surface of the lance may also be water cooled to minimise the formation of<br>
accretions or it may be coated with refractory.<br>
In addition, the oxygen injection through the central pipe 73 has a sufficient velocity to<br>
form a particle free zone internally of the oxygen pipe to thereby further contribute to<br>
minimising the formation of accretions. Typically the oxygen is injected with a velocity<br>
in the range of 50-300 m/s.<br><br>
The above-described injection of solids and gases produces an upward flow of fluidis-<br>
ing gas and entrained solids in the central region of the vessel. Increasingly, as the<br>
solids move upwardly, the solids disengage from the upward stream of fluidising gas<br>
and flow downwardly, typically in an annular region between the central region and the<br>
side wall of the vessel. Ultimately, solids recirculated in the downward stream are en-<br>
trained again in the upward stream of fluidising gas or are discharged from the vessel.<br>
The above-described injection of solids and gases also produces the following reac-<br>
tions in the vessel.<br>
Devolatilisation of coal to char and decomposition of coal volatiles to gaseous products<br>
(such as CO and H2) and reaction of at least part of the char with oxygen to form CO.<br>
Direct reduction of iron ore to at least partially reduced iron ore by gaseous products<br>
CO, and H2. These reaction in turn produce CO2 and H2O.<br>
Reaction of part of the CO2 formed within the bed with carbon to form CO (Boudouard<br>
reaction)<br>
Combustion of char, metallised ore, coal volatiles, CO, and H2 with oxygen which gen-<br>
erates heat that assists with maintaining the reactions described in the preceding dot<br>
points.<br>
The relative densities of the solids and the above-described injection of the solids and<br>
the gases, including the locations of the solids/gas injection, results in reaction zones<br>
forming in the vessel. These zones may be contiguous.<br>
One reaction zone is a carbon-rich zone in the region of the lance tip 11 of the lance 9.<br>
In this zone the predominant reactions are oxidizing reactions involving combustion of<br>
char, coal volatiles, CO, and H2 with oxygen which generates heat.<br><br>
Another reaction zone is a metal-rich zone in which coal is devolatilised and forms char<br>
and iron ore fines are at least partially reduced by CO, and H2.<br>
The above-described downward flow of solids in the annular region between the central<br>
region and the side wall 7 facilitates transfer of heat from the carbon-rich zone to the<br>
metal-rich zone.<br>
In addition, the downward flow of solids partially shields the side wall 7 from direct ex-<br>
posure to radiant heat from the central region of the vessel.<br>
The above-described process also produces a stream of off-gas and entrained solids<br>
that is discharged from the vessel via an outlet 27 in an upper section of the vessel.<br>
The off-gas stream is processed by separating solids from the off-gas and returning<br>
such solids to the vessel via a solids return leg 29. Thereafter, the off-gas is treated by<br>
a series of steps of (a) removing further solids from the off-gas, (b) cooling the off-gas,<br>
(c) H2O removal, (d) CO2 removal, (e) compression of the remaining off-gas, and (f) •<br>
reheating. The treated off-gas is thereafter returned to the vessel as part of the fluidis-<br>
ing gas.<br>
The above-described process produces a stream of solids, including at least partially<br>
reduced iron ore and char, that is discharged from the vessel via an outlet 25 in the<br>
base of the vessel. The solids stream may be processed by separating the at least<br>
partially reduced iron ore and part of the other solids. The separated other solids, pre-<br>
dominantly char, may be returned to the vessel as a part of the solids feed for the proc-<br>
ess. The at least partially reduced iron ore is further processed as required. By way of<br>
example, the at least partially reduced iron ore may be supplied to a molten bath-based<br>
smelting vessel and smelted to molten iron, for example by a process such as the so<br>
called "Hlsmelt process".<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the embodiment of the apparatus shown in the Figure com-<br>
prises a first vessel 103 that contains a fluidised bed of gas and entrained solids and a<br>
second vessel 105 that contains a fluidised bed of gas and entrained solids.<br><br>
The first vessel 103 functions as a heat generator and generates a stream of hot off-<br>
gas containing entrained solids, predominantly char, that is transferred to the second<br>
vessel 105 via a line 107. The purpose of the hot off-gas stream is to provide at least<br>
part of the heat required for reactions in the second vessel.<br>
The second vessel 105 functions as a direct reduction reactor and at least partially re-<br>
duces iron ore fines in the solid state.<br>
The second vessel produces two output streams.<br>
One output stream, which is discharged from the second vessel 105 via an outlet 109 in<br>
the base of the second vessel 105, comprises a predominantly solids stream of at least<br>
partially reduced iron ore fines and entrained solids, typically char.<br>
The solids stream may be processed by separating the at least partially reduced iron<br>
ore fines and the other solids. The other solids, predominantly char, may be returned<br>
to the first vessel and/or the second vessel as a part of the solids feed for the vessels.<br>
The at least partially reduced iron ore fines are further processed as required. By way<br>
of example, the at least partially reduced iron ore fines may be supplied to a molten<br>
bath-based smelting vessel and smelted to molten iron, for example by a process such<br>
as the Hlsmelt process.<br>
The other output stream from the second vessel 105 is discharged via an outlet 61 in<br>
an upper section of the second vessel 105, comprises hot off-gas and entrained solids.<br>
The off-gas stream is transferred to a cyclone 113 via a line 111. The cyclone 113<br>
separates entrained solids from the off-gas stream. The solids flow downwardly from<br>
the cyclone 113 via a line 115 and into the first vessel 103 via return leg 155. The off-<br>
gas stream and any remaining solids flows upwardly from the cyclone 113 into a mixing<br>
chamber 117.<br>
The off-gas passed to mixing chamber 117 from cyclone 113, mixes with and heats<br>
solids passed to the mixing chamber 117 from a further cyclone 121 via a line 123. A<br><br>
majority of the solids are carried over from the mixing chamber 117 as part of an output<br>
off-gas stream .<br>
The output stream of off-gas and entrained solids from the mixing chamber 117 flows<br>
via a line 125 into a further cyclone 127. There is solids/gas separation in the cyclone<br>
127. Separated solids flow downwardly from the cyclone 127 via a line 129 into the<br>
second vessel 105. Separated off-gas from the cyclone 127 along with any remaining<br>
solids flows upwardly from the cyclone 127 into a further mixing chamber 131.<br>
The off-gas stream from the cyclone 127 mixes with and heats iron ore fines in the mix-<br>
ing chamber 131. The iron ore fines are supplied to the mixing chamber 131 via a lock<br>
hopper assembly 133. The majority of the iron ore feed is carried from mixing chamber<br>
131 to cyclone 121 via line 135. Solids separation occurs in cyclone 121 such that a<br>
majority of the solids pass via line 123 to mixing chamber 117. As described previ-<br>
ously, from mixing chamber 117, the solids pass to cyclone 127 via line 125. From cy-<br>
clone 127 the majority of solids pass to the second vessel 105 via line 129.<br>
The off-gas from the cyclone 121 is transferred via a line 137 to an off-gas processing<br>
unit 139 and is treated in the unit as described hereinafter. Specifically, the off-gas is<br>
treated by a series of steps of including (a) removing further solids from the off-gas, (b)<br>
cooling the off-gas, (c) H2O removal, (d) CO2 removal, (e) compression, and (f) reheat-<br>
ing.<br>
The treated off-gas from the off-gas processing unit 139 becomes a fluidising gas for<br>
the vessels 103 and 105. It is transferred to the vessels via a transfer line 141. The<br>
fluidising gas is injected into the base of each vessel 103 and 105.<br>
Medium-high volatile coal having a particle size of minus 6 mm is supplied into a lower<br>
section of the first vessel 103 via a lance 143 that extends through a side wall of the<br>
first vessel 103.<br><br>
In addition, oxygen is supplied into the first vessel 103 via a lance 145 that has the<br>
same basic construction as the lance 45 in Figures 1, 2 and 3 and directs oxygen<br>
downwardly in a central region of the first vessel 103.<br>
As is described above, preheated iron ore fines are supplied into the second vessel 105<br>
via the line 129 and the hot off-gas stream containing entrained solids from the first<br>
vessel 103 is supplied into the second vessel via the line 107.<br>
In addition, oxygen is supplied into the second vessel 105 via a lance 149 that has the<br>
same basic construction as the lance 9 in Figures 1 and 2 that directs the oxygen<br>
downwardly in a central region of the second vessel 105.<br>
The above-described introduction of coal and fluidising gas into the first vessel 103<br>
along with returned solids from return leg 115 produces an upward flow of fluidising gas<br>
and entrained solids in a central region of the first vessel 103. Increasingly, as the sol-<br>
ids move upwardly, they disengage from the upward stream of fluidising gas and typi-<br>
cally flow downwardly in an annular region between the central region and the side wall<br>
of the first vessel 103. Ultimately, retained solids in the downward stream of fluidising<br>
gas are entrained again in the upward stream of the fluidising gas.<br>
The upward stream of fluidising gas and entrained solids in the central region of the<br>
first vessel 103 is countercurrent to the downward flow of oxygen gas.<br>
In the first vessel the coal is devolatilised to char and coal volatiles which then decom-<br>
pose to gaseous products such as H2. At least part of the char and the decomposed<br>
coal volatiles react with oxygen and form CO and other reaction products. These reac-<br>
tions generate substantial heat and, as is described above, the heat is transferred into<br>
the second vessel 105 by the hot output off-gas stream containing entrained solids that<br>
flows into the second vessel via the line 107.<br>
The above-described introduction of the preheated iron ore fines, the hot off-gas stream<br>
containing entrained solids from the first vessel 103, the oxygen-containing gas, and<br>
the fluidising gas into the second vessel produces an upward flow of gas and entrained<br><br>
solids in a central region of the second vessel 105. Increasingly, as the solid particles<br>
move upwardly, the solid particles disengage from the upward stream of gas and flow<br>
downwardly in an annular region between the central region and the side wall of the<br>
second vessel 105. Ultimately, retained solids are either entrained again in the upward<br>
stream of the fluidizing gas or are discharged from the vessel via outlet 109.<br>
The above-described introduction of the preheated iron ore fines, the hot off-gas stream<br>
containing entrained solids from the first vessel 103, the oxygen-containing gas, and<br>
the fluidising gas into the second vessel 105 produces the following reactions in the<br>
second vessel.<br>
Reaction of at least part of the CO2 (formed during reduction of iron ore) with carbon to<br>
form CO (Boudouard reaction).<br>
Direct reduction of iron ore fines to at least partially reduced iron by gaseous products<br>
CO and H2. These reactions in turn produce CO2 and H2O.<br>
Oxidation of solids and gasses, such as partially reduced iron ore particles, char, H2<br>
and CO, in an upper section of the second vessel 105 which generates heat and pro-<br>
motes controlled agglomeration of smaller partially reduced ore particles with other par-<br>
ticles within the fluidised bed.<br>
The applicant does not have a totally clear understanding at this stage of the mecha-<br>
nism or mechanisms that enable controlled agglomeration of metalliferous material de-<br>
scribed in the last dot point above to be achieved. Nevertheless, without wishing to be<br>
bound by the following comments, in the research project the applicant observed that<br>
the agglomerates that formed comprise smaller particles, particularly fines that adhere<br>
to each other and to larger particles. The applicant speculates that the conditions in<br>
the carbon-rich zone, are such that (a) micron sized partially and completely reduced,<br>
i.e. metallised, iron ore particles react with oxygen and generate heat and the resultant<br>
oxidised particles become sticky (b) fine coal particles react with oxygen and oxidise<br>
and the resultant ash becomes sticky ; and (c) fine iron ore particles become sticky as<br>
a consequence of being heated. The applicant also speculates that these smaller<br><br>
sticky particles adhere to larger particles that have a higher heat sink capacity, with the<br>
overall beneficial result that there is a reduction in the proportion of smaller particles in<br>
the vessel that can adhere to apparatus surfaces and be carried out from the vessel in<br>
an off-gas stream.<br>
As is indicated above, the present invention was made during the course of an on-<br>
going research project carried out by the applicant to develop CIRCOFER technology<br>
for the direct reduction of iron ore. The research project included a series of pilot plant<br>
runs on 350mm diameter and 700mm diameter pilot plant set-ups of the applicant.<br>
The following discussion focuses on research work on the 700 mm diameter vessel<br>
pilot plant.<br>
The pilot plant comprises an apparatus of the type shown in Figure 1 and 2. The pilot<br>
plant was operated as a circulating fluidised bed at atmospheric pressure. The vessel<br>
has a height of 10.7 m. An upper section of the vessel has a height of approximately<br>
8.9 m and an internal diameter of 700 mm. A lower section of the vessel has a height<br>
of approximately 1.8m and an internal diameter of 500 mm. This height of 1.8 m in-<br>
cludes the height of a fluidising grate and a transition section between the 500 mm di-<br>
ameter and the 700 mm diameter sections. The vessel is refractory lined.<br>
Off-gas from the vessel was processed to remove entrained solids by passing the off-<br>
gas successively through 3 cyclones connected in series. The first cyclone (cyclone 1)<br>
received off-gas directly from the vessel. Solids separated in the cyclone were re-<br>
turned to the vessel via a seal pot that provided for pressure sealing. The second cy-<br>
clone (cyclone 2) received off-gas from cyclone 1. Solids separated in the cyclone<br>
were returned to the vessel via a direct return of solids (i.e. no seal pot). The third cy-<br>
clone (cyclone 3) received off-gas from the second 2. Solids separated by cyclone 3<br>
were not returned to the vessel.<br>
After solids separation by the three cyclones, the off-gas was further treated by a radial<br>
flow scrubber, which further removed solids from the off-gas. These solids were con-<br><br>
centrated by a thickener and then passed through a drum filter to produce thickener<br>
sludge.<br>
Off-gas leaving the radial flow scrubber was then treated by a tube cooler that operated<br>
to dewater the off-gas by cooling it to within the range 10-30°C. Following treatment by<br>
the tube cooler, the off-gas was combusted.<br>
The fluidised bed was fluidised by air during the initial stages of testing and was later<br>
fluidised by a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gas. As there were no provisions for<br>
processing and recycling the process off-gas, e.g. CO2 removal and compression, it<br>
was not possible for it to be returned to the vessel as fluidising gas. In this regard, hy-<br>
drogen gas was used to simulate the effect of using processed off-gas as fluidising gas.<br>
In summary, the research work demonstrated the following:<br>
The concept of a coal based fluidised bed reduction process with oxygen injection, pro-<br>
ducing a reduced product with metallisation levels of up to 78%.<br>
Injecting oxygen into/or close to a fluidised bed with up to 42% metallic iron in the bed<br>
appears to be feasible without the formation of accretions.<br>
The concept of simultaneously reducing iron ore and partially burning coal for energy in<br>
a single bed vessel appears to be feasible, at metallic iron loadings up to 48% in the<br>
product.<br>
The position of the oxygen lance in the vessel is important because of the desirability of<br>
transferring the heat of oxidation back into the bed while minimising the level of iron re-<br>
oxidation. The 4-m position is about right for the conditions tested.<br>
High phosphorus Brockman iron ore was successfully fluidised and reduced without<br>
excessive dust make. (Brockman ore is a friable West Australian iron ore, made avail-<br>
able by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, Perth, Western Australia.)<br><br>
Objectives of the experimental program:<br>
The primary objective was to achieve stable operation for a significant amount of time<br>
with high phosphorus Brockman ore (-3mm) and Blair Athol coal.<br>
The plan was to operate with low iron ore feed (up to 20% in product discharge) for two<br>
days with the oxygen lance in a low position (1.9-m above the distributor plate (not<br>
shown in the Figure) of the vessel. The aim was then to operate for three days with<br>
high ore feed (up to 70% in the product) with the oxygen lance in an upper position<br>
(3.8-m above the distributor plate).<br>
Start-up:<br>
The campaign started on 9 December 2003 at 0600 hrs with a gradual heat up of the<br>
700-mm vessel (hereinafter also referred to as a "CFB") using alumina as the bed ma-<br>
terial. Once the target temperature was reached, coal and oxygen were introduced into<br>
the vessel at 1550 hrs. The oxygen rate was increased up to 105 Nm3/hr while the coal<br>
rate was in the range 300-450 kg/hr.<br>
Operation with coal and oxygen 10/12/03 - 11/12/03<br>
Operation with coal, air and oxygen was conducted on 10/12/03. The operation was<br>
very smooth with the system stabilising fairly quickly and the vessel maintaining its<br>
temperature of 900-930°C without any problems.<br>
The standard operating conditions during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperature: 930°C bottom and 900°C top<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate: 140Nm3/hr (N2) and 300Nm3/hr (air)<br>

The discharge product was clean with only some small +2mm pieces which looked like<br>
residual refractory material. The dust make was reasonably low with 
charge reporting to the final cyclone discharge.<br>

10/12/03 2200 - 11/12/03 0600: Iron Ore at 10 kg/hr<br>
Iron ore (
10 kg-hr. Hydrogen was also introduced into the fluidising gas at a rate of 20 Nm3/hr to<br>
simulate use of processed off-gas as fluidising gas. The operation was smooth with the<br>
bed AP being maintained at about 100-120 mbar and the temperature profile having a<br>
range of only 10°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
The product appeared fine without any signs of accretions or agglomerates. However,<br>
on screening the product (at 2mm) some larger scale type material was found but this<br>
was only a very small proportion of the overall product. The scale appeared to be<br>
made up of ash/char and probably formed on the walls of the vessel or distributor plate<br>
in the vessel.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br><br>
CFB temperatures: 930°C bottom and 900°C top<br>

Offgas Analysis<br><br>
11/12/13 0600-11/12/03 1200: Iron Ore at 20 kg/hr<br>
The iron ore feed rate was increased up to 20 kg/hr at 0600 on 11/12/03 until 1200<br>
11/12/03 and the hydrogen gas rate was also increased up to 40 Nm3/hr. The operation<br>
continued to be smooth without any disruptions. The vessel bed pressure was being<br>
maintained at about 80-100 mbar and the temperature profile had a range of only 10°C<br>
between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates. As before the only exception to this was the odd piece of scale type<br>
material, which appeared to be composed of ash/char.<br><br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 952°C bottom and 940°C top<br>

Offgas Analysis<br><br>
11/12/03 1200 - 12/12/03 0600: Iron Ore at 40 kg/hr<br>
Summary:<br>
The iron ore feed rate was increased up to 40 kg/hr at 1200 on 11/12/03 and operated<br>
with this rate until 0600 12/12/03, while the hydrogen gas rate was maintained at 40<br><br>
Nm3/hr and the coal rate was around 360-420 kg/hr. The operation continued to be<br>
smooth without any disruptions and the iron product discharge was highly metallised.<br>
Dust make was also low with less than 10% of the total discharge coming from the final<br>
cyclone (i.e. cyclone 3). The vessel bed AP was being maintained at about 90-135<br>
mbar and the temperature profile had a range of less than 10°C between the bottom<br>
and the top of the bed.<br>
Results<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates.<br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 953°C bottom and 941 °C top<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate: 370 Nm3/hr (N2) and 40 Nm3/hr (H2)<br>
Pressure drop CFB: 98-130 mbar<br>

A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 190-210 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 15-20 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis<br><br><br><br>
The high metallisation achieved (70-77%) indicates that the oxygen lance (even at its<br>
1.9-m position) did not penetrate too far to the bottom of the bed and that there was<br>
good segregation within the bed. The lower part of the bed is iron rich. The higher part<br>
of the bed is carbon rich and this is interacting with the oxygen lance to generate heat<br>
and this heat is then transferred back into the bed by the recirculation of the solids to<br>
the lower parts of the bed. The low CO/CO2 ratio in the off-gas indicates achievement<br>
of high post combustion, with the energy levels being transferred back into the bed,<br>
while maintaining high metallisation levels in the product discharge.<br>
The iron levels in the product and the degree of metallisation indicates that the 700-mm<br>
vessel can be operated in gasification mode with up to 20-25% metallic iron content<br>
without any problems with accretions. This is a significant achievement.<br><br>
Oxygen Lance Inspection (12/12/03)<br>
The lance was taken out of the 700-mm vessel and inspected on 12/12/03.<br>
In summary, the lance was clean. The water cooled pipe as well as the nozzle tip had<br>
no evidence of any buildup of material.<br>
The lance was repositioned in the vessel at a higher position i.e. 3.8-m above the dis-<br>
tributor plate. The vessel was restarted with coal and oxygen and then once stabilised<br>
iron ore and hydrogen.<br>
Operation with Iron Ore (110-200 kg/hr). Coal and Oxygen (lance 4-m height)<br>
0600 -1200: Iron Ore at 110 kg/hr<br>
Summary;<br>
The iron ore feed rate was increased stepwise up to 110 kg/hr at 0625 and operated<br>
with this rate until 1200 while the hydrogen gas rate was also increased stepwise up to<br>
110 Nm3/hr over a 2 hr period. The coal rate was around 360-400 kg/hr. The operation<br>
continued to be smooth without any disruptions and the iron product discharge from the<br>
vessel was up to 78% metallised. Dust make was also low with 
charge coming from the final cyclone (i.e. cyclone 3). The vessel bed AP was being<br>
maintained at about 90-135 mbar and the temperature profile had a range of less than<br>
5°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
Increasing the lance height from 1.9m to 3.8m did not seem to impact on the bed tem-<br>
perature profile. In fact, the temperature spread was less than 5°C from top to bottom.<br>
Results:<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates.<br><br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 953°C bottom and 951 °C top<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate CFB 10 Nm3/hr (N2) at 860°C, 110 Nm3/hr (N2) at 740°C, 180<br>
Nm3/hr (N2) at 680°C, and 110 Nm3/hr (H2) at 860°C<br>
Pressure drop CFB: 80-100 mbar<br>
Oxygen flowrate: 110 Nm3 /hr<br>
N2 shield gas flowrate: 30-40 Nm3/hr<br>
Coal Feed Rate: 360-400 kg/hr<br>
Iron Ore Feed Rate: 110 kg/hr<br>
A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 162 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 16 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis<br><br>
With the higher oxygen lance position the uniform bed temperature profile of the lower<br>
lance was maintained. This indicates that even with the oxygen lance at the 3.8m posi-<br>
, tion the solids recirculation profile is such that enough heat is transferred back into the<br>
bottom of the bed.<br><br>
The temperature profile in the vessel and the cyclones indicated that there was proba-<br>
bly no increase in dust make with the increase in iron ore feed rate up to 110 kg/hr.<br>
The discharge from the final cyclone relative to the vessel also did not change signifi-<br>
cantly. This suggests that either the iron ore is not breaking down as much as predicted<br>
or that any fines generated are re-agglomerated in the high temperature region of the<br>
oxygen lance.<br>
13/12/03 1200 - 16/12/03 0500: Iron Ore at 120 - 230 kg/hr<br>
Summary:<br>
For the first period of this operation from 17:00 13/12/03 to 12:00 16/12/03 the opera-<br>
tion rate was approximately 120 kg/h iron ore feed. This included a period of distur-<br>
bance where there was no feed. The final period operated at approximately 230 kg/h<br>
iron ore feed.<br>
The operation with 230 kg/hr iron ore feed rate was smooth without any disruptions and<br>
the iron product discharge from the CFB ranged from 48% to 78% metallised. Dust<br>
make was also low at 
bed AP was being maintained at about 80-100 mbar and the temperature profile range<br>
had now increased to about 20°C between the bottom and the top of the bed.<br>
Operating the vessel at the higher iron ore feed rate of 200 kg/hr increased the range of<br>
the CFB temperature profile with the bottom part of the bed now being up to 20°C<br>
colder than the middle of the bed. The metallisation levels were also lower at the<br>
higher iron ore feed rates but they were still in the 60-80% metallisation range.<br>
Results:<br>
The appearance of the product continued to be good without any signs of accretions or<br>
agglomerates.<br><br>
The standard operating conditions and results during this period were as follows.<br>
CFB temperatures: 947°C bottom and 960°C top<br>
FB gas heater temperature: 740°C and 615°C main heater<br>
Fluidising gas flowrate CFB: 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 840°C, 100 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 740°C,<br>
185 20 Nm3/hr (N2) at 615°C, and 140 Nm3/hr (H2) @ 840°C<br>
Pressure drop CFB: 83-96 mbar<br>
Oxygen flowrate: 113 Nm3/hr<br>
N2 shield gas flowrate: 30-40 Nm3/hr<br>
Coal Feed Rate: 380 kg/hr<br>
Iron Ore Feed Rate: 200 kg/hr<br>
A summary of the results is as follows:<br>
Bed Discharge Rate: 227-286 kg/hr<br>
Cyclone 3 Discharge: 18-24 kg/hr<br>
Offgas Analysis (0400 hrs 15/12/03)<br><br><br><br>
At the high iron ore feed rates (200 kg/hr) the discharge from the vessel increased sig-<br>
nificantly while the discharge from the final! cyclone only increased slightly. However,<br>
the discharge from the final cyclone relative to the vessel did not seem to change. It<br>
was further observed that the amount of fines 
the amount of fines 
 <br>
breaking down as much as predicted or that any fines generated are re-agglomerated<br>
in the high temperature region of the oxygen lance. The temperature profile through<br>
the cyclones also supports this since there were no significant increases in tempera-<br>
tures through the cyclone system at the higher iron ore feed rates. The product metal-<br>
lisation levels were maintained in the range of 68-78% during the high iron ore feed<br>
rates while the product discharge had up to 48% metallic iron.<br>
Oxygen Lance and Vessel Inspection (16/12/03 and 19/12/03)<br>
The lance was taken out of the 700-mm vessel and inspected on 16/12/03. In sum-<br>
mary, the lance was fairly clean. The water cooled pipe had a thin coating of material<br>
while the nozzle tip was relatively clean. The nature of the build up (flaky and thin) sug-<br>
gested that this would not lead to any operational problems.<br>
Iron Distribution &amp; Agglomeration<br>
Analysis of the Brockman ore sample used as feed to the fluidised bed indicated a fines<br>
content of approximately 10.6% sub 45 micron. These units were expected to appear<br>
as output from cyclone 3 or as thickener sludge. Due to the friable nature of Brockman<br>
Ore, it was expected that additional fines would be produced during processing. It was<br>
therefore expected that the percentage of iron units exiting the system through cyclone<br>
3 would exceed 10.6%.<br>
It was observed that approximately 7% of the iron units input to the fluidised bed were<br>
discharged through cyclone 3, either as direct output from cyclone 3 (approximately<br>
4%) or as output from the radial flow scrubber (approximately 3%). Analysis of the<br>
main product output from the fluidised bed indicated that an agglomeration mechanism<br>
was present within the process. This mechanism appeared to be primarily smaller par-<br>
ticles, typically sub 100 micron particles, agglomerating to each other and to larger par-<br>
ticles.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the embodiments of the present invention shown<br>
in Figures 1 thru 4 without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
