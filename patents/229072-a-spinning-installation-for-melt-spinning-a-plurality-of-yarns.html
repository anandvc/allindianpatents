Spinning installation<br>
The invention relates to a spinning installation for melt spinning a plurality of yarns, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
A spinning installation of the described type is known from EP 0 742 851 Bl.<br>
In the known spinning installation, for melt spinning a plurality of yarns a plurality of spinning nozzles are disposed in two parallel rows alongside one another. The spinning nozzles are connected to one or more melt sources, so that a multifilament yam is extruded from each of the spinning nozzles. The spinning nozzles are disposed inside a heated spinning beam. Underneath the spinning beam, a cooling device with a double cooling shaft is constructed, so that a separate cooling shaft is associated with each of the nozzle rows. The two cooling shafts interact with a common pressure chamber, which is connected to a cooling stream source.<br>
For the eventuality that a greater number of yarns are to be manufactured simultaneously by the spinning installation, for economy of space the nozzle rows are disposed as closely adjacent as possible. This however presents the problem of the cooling air supply, since the space available for the pressure chamber formed between the nozzle rows becomes correspondingly small. For the economical use of air conditioning devices, however, flow rates that are as low as possible have to be observed in the supply ducts. Given the high number of extruded yarns, there is moreover the problem of uniform cooling of all of the yarns.<br>
The object of the invention is accordingly to develop the spinning installation of the described type in such a way that, despite closely adjacent spinning nozzles in the two nozzle rows, a uniform intensive cooling of all of the yarns is achieved.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to combine a compact style of construction of the nozzle rows with the holding in readiness of a sufficient cooling air quantity of a cooling stream source to cool the yarns.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a spinning installation having the features of the preamble of claim 1 in that the plurality of spinning nozzles of the two spinning nozzle rows along the machine longitudinal side are divided into a plurality of spinning locations, that associated with the spinning locations there is in each case one of a plurality of double cooling shafts, and that the central pressure chambers of the double cooling shafts are connected to the cooling stream source by an air duct, which is disposed laterally alongside the machine longitudinal side.<br>
The invention is notable in particular for the fact that the spinning nozzles are divided into groups by the formation of a plurality of spinning locations, wherein with each group of spinning nozzles a double cooling shaft is associated. It is therefore possible to limit the number of yarns that are cooled simultaneously inside the double cooling shaft. The cooling air supply of all of the double cooling shafts is in said case ensured by means of an air duct disposed laterally alongside the machine longitudinal side. It is therefore possible to select a supply cross section of the air duct that is independent of the spacing of the nozzle rows and may be selected exclusively in accordance with the quantity and the admissible pressure drop in the supply system. It is therefore advantageously possible to realize low flow rates of below 10 m/s. A further particular advantage of the invention is that the spinning nozzles may be disposed in a very close and compact manner in the nozzle rows.<br>
For the connection of the double cooling shafts to the central air duct, the pressure chambers are connected individually or in groups by transverse connection pieces to the air duct. In the present case, the transverse connection pieces are advantageously constructed between the spinning locations.<br><br>
So that the yarn sheets associated with the nozzle rows may run reliably with an extremely smooth yarn course into a common collecting plane, the cooling shafts of the double cooling shafts open out in each case into a common quenching cell. The quenching cells have a downward-tapering shape, so that the transverse connection pieces are disposed preferentially between the quenching cells.<br>
At the yarns of the two yarn sheets, a compactness of the yarn is advantageously already achieved before running into the collecting plane by means of two separate preparation devices, which are associated with the cooling shafts of the double cooling shafts.<br>
A further preferred development of the invention is notable in particular for the fact that the spinning locations are divided into groups by the formation of a plurality of longitudinal modules, wherein each group, in terms of its arrangement of the spinning nozzles and temperature adjustment of the spinning nozzles, is kept identical. As a result of the passageway formed between the longitudinal modules, each longitudinal module may be attended from both machine longitudinal sides. In particular, short piecing times may be realized at the start of operation or after an interruption of operation since both an attendant may supply the spinning nozzles of both nozzle rows of a longitudinal module.<br>
The development of the invention, in which the longitudinal modules are formed in each case by a box-shaped nozzle carrier, which is heated by means of a heat transfer medium and at the end facing the passageway is supplied via an inlet and outlet with a heat transfer medium, is particularly advantageous for uniform temperature adjustment of the spinning nozzles in the spinning locations. Furthermore, a heat transfer circuit aligned in longitudinal direction may easily be realized by providing the box-shaped nozzle carrier with a slight inclination aligned in machine longitudinal side. A further advantage lies in the fact that the free spaces formed inside the spinning installation by the passageways are<br><br>
advantageously usable for the cooling air supply as well as other supply lines and supply units.<br>
In order within each spinning location to be able to assign events, such as e.g. yarn breakages, to one of the spinning nozzle rows and/or one of the spinning nozzles of the spinning nozzle rows, according to a further advantageous development of the invention the yarns are brought together in the collecting plane in a predetermined sequence. It is therefore possible for example to define sequences, in which the yam sheet of one nozzle row is conveyed side by side with the yarn sheet of the adjacent nozzle row in the collecting plane. It is however also possible for the yams of the two nozzle rows to be conveyed alternately side by side in the collecting plane.<br>
Because of the plurality of yams within a spinning location, the take-up device per spinning location is formed by preferably one spooling frame having two winding units or in each case spooling frames having one winding unit each. This makes it possible to form compact winding units suitable for high spooling speeds.<br>
In order as far as possible to wind the yam sheet of a nozzle row simultaneously into bobbins, it is further proposed that the yam sheet drawn off after treatment is apportioned to the winding units in such a way that the yams of the one nozzle row and the yams of the other nozzle row are wound in a predetermined allocation into bobbins. In this case, the allocation is preferably selected in such a way that the yams of one of the nozzle row are all wound onto a spool spindle of one of the winding units.<br>
The invention is therefore notable in particular for a very compact style of construction, which takes up ca. 40% less room than conventional spinning installations.<br><br>
There now follows a detailed description of the invention by way of an embodiment of a spinning installation according to the invention and with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The drawings show:<br>
Figs. 1 to 3	several diagrammatic views of an embodiment of the spinning<br>
installation according to the invention;<br>
Figs. 4 and 5       diagrammatic views of an embodiment of a yarn guide for<br>
distribution in the collecting plane;<br>

for distribution in the collecting plane;<br>
Fig. 7	a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of the take-up device of<br>
the spinning installation of Fig. 1.<br>
Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show various views of an embodiment of the spinning installation according to the invention. Of these drawings, Fig. 1 shows a view of the machine longitudinal side, Fig. 2 a cutout of the spinning installation of Fig. 1 with two spinning locations, and Fig. 3 a view of a spinning location transversely of the machine longitudinal side. The following description applies to all of the figures, unless express reference is made to one of the figures.<br>
The spinning installation is supported by a multi-tier machine frame 1, which is indicated in Figures 1, 2 and 3 only in the form of a lateral beam. In an upper tier of the machine frame 1 a plurality of longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are disposed side by side along the machine longitudinal side. The longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 comprise in each case a plurality of spinning nozzles 4, which are arranged in two parallel nozzle rows A and B.<br><br>
As is shown in Fig. 15 the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 disposed along the machine longitudinal side are separated from one another in each case by a passageway D. The passageway D between the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 extends in the present case through all of the tiers of the machine frame 1.<br>
The longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are formed in each case by a box-shaped nozzle carrier 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. Disposed inside the box-shaped nozzle carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 are the spinning nozzles 4 associated with the longitudinal module as well as the distribution pumps 5 connected to the spinning nozzles 4 as well as further melt-distributing devices that are not illustrated here. For heating the melt-carrying components, the nozzle carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 are each connected to a heat transfer circuit. For this purpose, an inlet 11 and an outlet 12 are disposed at the end faces 33 of the nozzle carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. The outlet 12 is formed in each case in the bottom region of the nozzle carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, wherein the nozzle carriers are held in a slightly inclined arrangement so that the heat transfer medium arising as condensation product may easily be removed. The supply lines of the inlet 11 and of the outlet 12 are advantageously constructed in the region of the passageways D.<br>
The devices for melt generation and/or melt distribution, which are disposed above the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, are not shown. It is for example possible for the melt-carrying components of a plurality of longitudinal modules to be supplied by means of an extruder.<br>
Each of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 is divided into a plurality of spinning locations. There now follows a detailed description of the layout and construction of the spinning locations by way of the longitudinal module 2.1 and with reference to Figs. 2 and 3.<br><br>
Each of the spinning locations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 comprises a total of 12 spinning nozzles 4, which are evenly split between the two nozzle rows A and B. The spinning nozzles of the nozzle rows A and B are each connected to a distribution pump 5. Each of the distribution pumps 5 has a drive shaft 6, which is coupled to a drive that is not illustrated here. A polymer melt is fed in each case through a melt port 7 to the distribution pumps 5.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the spinning nozzles of a spinning location are supplied by two separate distribution pumps. It is however also possible for example, given a total number of six or eight spinning nozzles in two nozzle rows, for all of the spinning nozzles to be supplied by one distribution pump. Here, it is expressly pointed out that the number of spinning nozzles per spinning location is by way of example.<br>
Disposed underneath the nozzle carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 is a cooling device 13. The cooling device 13 comprises one double cooling shaft 14 per spinning location. The double cooling shafts 14.1, 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4 are therefore associated with the spinning locations 3.1 to 3.4 of the first longitudinal module 2.1.<br>
As is evident from Fig. 3, each of the double cooling shafts 14.1 to 14.4 is formed by two separate cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2, which are associated with the spinning nozzles 4 of the nozzle rows A and of the nozzle row B. Between the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2, the double cooling shafts 14.1 to 14.4 each have a pressure chamber 16. Between the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2 and the pressure chamber 16 the blast walls 17.1 and 17.2 are formed, so that a transversely directed cooling air stream is generated in the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2. The pressure chambers 16 of the double cooling shafts 14.1 to 14.4 are connected in the bottom region by an air port 18 and a transverse connection piece 19 to a central air duct 20. The central air duct 20 extends laterally parallel to the machine longitudinal side and supplies all of the double cooling shafts of the cooling<br><br>
device 13. In said case, the air duct 20 is connected to a cooling stream source (not shown here), which is usually formed by an air conditioning device. By virtue of the lateral arrangement of the air duct 20, this duct may be constructed with a relatively large supply cross section, [so] that, even given the connection of many double cooling shafts, an adequate air quantity may be provided at a correspondingly low flow rate and hence with a low pressure drop. The air duct 20 in the present case may also be formed by two or more sub-sections, which are all connected to the air conditioning device and each supply a plurality of double cooling shafts with cooling air.<br>
The transverse connection pieces 19, which are connected to the air duct 20, are disposed in the bottom region of the cooling device 13 between the spinning locations. The bottom region of the cooling device 13 for this purpose is formed in each case by a quenching cell, which quenching cells for the first longitudinal module 2.1 are denoted by the reference characters 34.1, 34.2, 34.3 and 34.4. The quenching cells 34.1 to 34.4 in the present case have a downward-tapering shape, so that the free spaces arising between the spinning locations are used to receive the transverse connection pieces 19. The lateral supply of the blast air offers the special advantage that the spinning nozzle rows A and B may be arranged with as close a pitch as possible relative to one another. An air supply disposed through the centre plane extending between the nozzle rows A and B would, because of low supply cross sections, be suitable only for a few or even only one double cooling shaft.<br>
The double cooling shafts, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, are connected by in each case one transverse connection piece to the air duct. It is however also possible to connect a plurality of double cooling shaft or a group of double cooling shafts e.g. of a longitudinal module by a separate transverse connection piece to the air duct.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 3, in the bottom region of the double cooling shaft 14.1 a preparation device 23.1 and 23.2 is associated with each cooling shaft 15.1 and<br><br>
15.2. In said case, the preparation device 23.1 is associated with the spinning nozzles 4 of the nozzle rows A, so that the extruded multifilament yarns 9 of the nozzle row A at the end of cooling are provided by the preparation device 23.1 with a coating of preparing agent. In a corresponding manner, the yarns 10 extruded from the spinning nozzles of the nozzle row B are prepared by the preparation device 23.2. After preparation, the yarns 9 and 10 are brought into a common collecting plane 35 to form a yarn sheet 22. For this purpose, a guide means 21 is disposed at the outlet side of the quenching cell 34.1. By means of this guide means 21, a predetermined sequence of the yams within the yarn sheet 22 is observed. The distribution of the yams 9 and 10 in the yarn sheet 22 is explained in greater detail below.<br>
As is shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, a treatment device 24 is disposed underneath the cooling device 13. The treatment device 24 comprises a plurality of treatment modules 36, wherein one of the treatment modules 36 is associated with each spinning location. In the example of the first longitudinal module 2.1, the treatment modules 36.1 to 36.4 are associated with the spinning locations 3.1 to 3.4. Depending on the type of yarn to be produced, the treatment modules are equipped with devices such as galettes, galette units, intermingling devices, yarn combs, heating devices, preparation device etc. In the illustrated embodiment, for representation purposes, two galettes 25.1 and 25.2 are shown by way of example.<br>
Within the treatment device the collecting plane 35, in which the yarn sheet 22 is guided, is rotated through 90° during the transfer from the guide means 21 to the ramp onto the first galette 25.L The yams are therefore conveyed at the galette<br>
25.1	in a plane aligned substantially transversely of the machine longitudinal<br>
direction.<br>
Disposed xmdemeath the treatment device 24 is the take-up device 26, which comprises a plurality of winding units. For example, two winding units 27.1 and<br>
27.2	are associated with each spinning location. The winding units 27.1 and 27.2<br><br>
may in said case take the form of a spooling frame or the form of two spooling frames positioned side by side. In the illustrated embodiment, the winding units 27.1 and 27.2 are constructed on synchronously operated spooling frames 37.1 and 37.2 respectively. The take-up device 26 is therefore formed from a plurality of spooling frames 37. In each of the winding units 27.1 and 27.2 the yarns of the yarn sheet 22 are wound in each case into a bobbin 32. The bobbins 32 for this purpose are clamped on a spool spindle 29.1. The spool spindle 29.1 is held in each winding unit 27.1 and 27.2 in each case by means of a spool revolver 28. The spool revolver 28 carries a second spool spindle 29.2, which is disposed offset by 180°. By rotating the spool revolver, the yarns of the yarn sheet 22 may therefore be wound continuously into bobbins. A tension roller 30 rests against the periphery of the bobbins 32. A cross-winding device for conveying the yarns to and fro in order to form cross-wound bobbins is disposed upstream of the tension roller and is not illustrated in detail here.<br>
Upstream of the entry of the yarn sheet 22 into the winding units 27.1 and 27.2 one double guide bead 31 per spinning location is provided for dividing the yarns of the yarn sheet 22. In the present case, an allocation tailored to the spinning nozzle rows A and B and/or to the spinning nozzles of the spinning nozzle rows A and B is observed by the double guide bead 31. For apportionment of the yarn sheet and for selected allocation, further explanations are provided below.<br>
In the spinning installation illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the cooling device 13, the treatment device 24 and the take-up device 26 for each of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are of an identical construction. During operation, one or more melt sources produce a polymer melt, e.g. based on polyester. The polymer melt is fed via a distribution system, which is not described in detail, to the distribution pumps 5 of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. The distribution pumps deliver the polymer melt at a pressure above atmospheric to the associated spinning nozzles 4. Each of the spinning nozzles 4 at its underside has a plurality of nozzle apertures, through which a bundle of fine filaments is extruded per yarn.<br><br>
Thus, each of the spinning nozzles of the spinning installation produces a multifilament yarn. The yarns spun per nozzle row within a spinning location are then cooled in the double cooling shaft provided per spinning location and after cooling are combined with the yams of the adjacent nozzle row to form a common yarn sheet 22. Before being combined, the yams 9 of nozzle row A and the yams 10 of nozzle row B are wetted with a liquid by the associated preparation devices 23.1 and 23.2 and then combined by the guide means 21 per spinning location to form the yam sheet 22. The yams of the yam sheet are conveyed parallel to, and at a slight distance from one another in each case through a treatment module 36 before then being wound, after treatment, by two winding units into bobbins.<br>
In such spinning installations, on the one hand, regular maintenance of the spinning nozzles and, on the other hand, the piecing of newly spun yams after an interruption of operation or at the start of operation has to be carried out by an attendant. By virtue of the combining of a plurality of spinning locations into a longitudinal module, an attendant may easily and quickly change over between the machine longitudinal sides. As is indicated in Fig. 3, from the middle tier one attendant may quickly attend the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of both machine longitudinal sides. For this purpose, a change of longitudinal side is possible through the passageway D between the longitudinal modules. Because of the short distance between the longitudinal sides, even after yarn breakages in one of the spinning locations very short interruptions of operation are achieved.<br>
In the spinning installation, supply lines and additional units, such as e.g. preparation delivery devices, may advantageously be integrated in the passageway D between adjacent longitudinal modules. Thus, a very compact, space-saving spinning installation may be provided. For instance, a second line of longitudinal modules might be disposed immediately alongside the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1, wherein all of the double cooling shafts might be supplied from one central air duct.   Thus,   entire  buildings  may  advantageously  be  equipped  with  such<br><br>
longitudinal modules arranged in rows, which take up around 30 to 40% less space than conventional spinning installations.<br>
For the monitoring of such spinning installations, usually each yam is monitored in its yarn course. For the eventuality that a yam breakage is detected, sensor means are provided, which supply corresponding signals to a control device. Such monitoring techniques are extremely important for allowing the manufacture of high-quality yarns in the entire spinning installation. A requirement of such monitoring and analysis of the events occurring within a yarn course is, however, knowing which spinning location and/or which spinning nozzle has produced the yarn. For this reason, when the yams from the two nozzle rows are brought together, a predetermined sequence is to be observed in order to allow the entire yarn course to be traced from the take-up device back to the spinning nozzle.<br>
In this respect, Figs. 4 and 5 diagrammatically illustrate an apportioning of the yams within a spinning location. The apportioning and the spinning location might be, for example, the spinning location denoted by the reference character 3.1 in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 in said case shows a diagrammatic view of the spinning location up to the formation of a yam sheet 22 and Fig. 5 shows a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of the spinning location. Unless express reference is made to one of the figures, the following description applies to both figures.<br>
On the partially illustrated nozzle carrier 8.1, a total of 12 spinning nozzles are evenly split between two nozzle rows A and B. The spinning nozzles 4 of nozzle row A accordingly produce six yarns, which are denoted by the reference character 9. The yams 10 of nozzle row B are extruded in a corresponding manner by the spinning nozzles of nozzle row B. Inside the cooling shafts (not shown here), the yams 9 and 10 run parallel as far as the preparation devices 23.1 and 23.2. In the present case, the preparation devices 23.1 and 23.2 are illustrated in the form of preparation rollers. The preparation devices may however also take the form of individual preparation pins, each of which wets one yam.<br><br>
The yams 9 and 10, after wetting, are conveyed into a common collecting plane 35. In the collecting plane 35, the yams 9 and 10 are arranged by the guide means into a yarn sheet 22, in which the twelve yams disposed side by side are in a predetermined sequence. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 4, the yams 10 of nozzle row B and the yarns 9 of nozzle row A are conveyed side by side in each case as a yarn sheet. The guide means 21, which is disposed underneath the quenching cell, might be formed e.g. by a yam guide bead.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 5, the collecting plane 35 is disposed in the central region between the spinning nozzles of nozzle row A and of nozzle row B. In this way, a uniform deflection of the yarns of both nozzle rows is achieved. It is therefore advantageously possible also to manufacture yams of identical physical properties.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment of an apportioning of the yams in the yam sheet. As the embodiment according to Fig. 6 is identical to the embodiment according to Fig. 4, at this point only the differences are indicated. With the apportioning of the yams 9 of nozzle row A and of the yams 10 of nozzle row B, the guide means 21 determines a sequence within the yam sheet 22, in which a yarn 9 of nozzle row A and a yam 10 of nozzle row B are alternately conveyed side by side. The result, according to the nozzle rows, is a sequence AB AB AB. The transfer of the yam sheet 22 into the treatment device is therefore defined in such a way that the origin of the yams is known.<br>
When manufacturing synthetic yams, the yam quality is very strongly determined by the respective spooling operation. For this reason, specific allocations between the spinning nozzles and the winding points may be advantageous in order to produce xmiform yarn qualities. Fig. 7, by way of an embodiment of a take-up device of the type that might be used for example in the spinning installation<br><br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, reveals how the yarns of the yam sheet, after treatment, are apportioned to the individual winding units.<br>
The winding units 27.1 and 27.2 in this case are constructed inside a spooling frame. The spooling frame has two spool revolvers 28.1 and 28.2. Each of the spool revolvers carries two spool spindles 29.1 and 29.2. Associated with each of the spool revolvers 28.1 and 28.2 is a tension roller 30.1 and 30.2 respectively. Above the tension rollers 30.1 and 30.2 a double guide bead 31 is provided, which has on both longitudinal sides parallel to the spool spindles in each case one yam guide per winding point. Such double spoolers are known in principle, being described for example in DE 100 45 473 Al. For this reason, for the further description of the spooling frame reference is made to the cited printed document.<br>
The yam sheet 22, after treatment, is apportioned by the double guide bead 31 in accordance with a preset allocation to the individual winding units 27.1 and 27.2. In said case, the yams 9 of nozzle row A and the yams 10 of nozzle row B are separated out of the yam sheet 22 and fed to the winding units 27.1 and 27.2 respectively. Thus, the yarns 9 of nozzle row A are wound on the spool spindle 29.1 of the winding unit 27.1 and the yams 10 of nozzle row B are wound on the spool spindle 29.2 of the winding unit 27.2 into bobbins. Thus, each of the yams within the yarn sheet 22 is identifiable at every point between the spinning nozzles and the take-up device. Monitoring and control of the spinning installation may therefore be implemented by simple means.<br>
The spinning installation illustrated in Fig. 1 is, in terms of its design of the treatment device and the take-up device, by way of example. For instance, all of the yarns of a spinning location might be received jointly by a spooling frame having a single winding unit. The design of the treatment device depends substantially on whether fully drawn yarns (FDY), pre-oriented yarns (POY), highly oriented yarns (HOY) or crimped yarns (BCF) are being produced. For this reason, the treatment device may be selectively equipped with units.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
