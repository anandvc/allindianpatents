				<td>This relates to an extruded honeycomb assembly.<br>
Extruded honeycomb body, in particular a catalytic converter carrier body, with reinforced wall structure<br>
The invention concerns a honeycomb body as set forth in the classifying portion of claim 1. Honeycomb bodies of that kind are used for example for the catalytic conversion of exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine.<br>
WO 94/15712 discloses an extruded honeycomb body of ceramic and/or metallic material having a plurality of passages which are separated from each other by partitions and which extend in approximately parallel relationship. The particular configuration of the wall structure increases elasticity in comparison with previously known honeycomb bodies.<br>
JP 54-150406A describes an extruded honeycomb body in which the passages are separated from each other by wall portions which cross each other approximately perpendicularly. In regard to the cross-section of the honeycomb body, the partitions, within two zones which extend in mutually crossing relationship from a respective outward side of the honeycomb body to an oppositely disposed outward side of the honeycomb body, are of a thickness which is greater than the basic thickness of the partitions. Wall portions with thick partitions extend through the zones diagonally with respect to the direction in which the zones extend so that the wall portions are thick in parts thereof and thin in other parts thereof. In a test for mechanical strength, that honeycomb body was compared to two honeycomb bodies in which the thickness of the partitions in the described zones is equal to the basic thickness of the partitions. The result of the test, which is shown in tabular form in JP 54-150406A, clearly shows that the honeycomb body with the thicker partitions in said zones enjoys no advantages whatsoever in terms of mechanical strength in comparison with the other two honeycomb bodies, and even has a lower level of mechanical strength in a direction diagonally with respect to the direction of the wall portions.<br>
In recent years the development of new honeycomb bodies has been<br><br>
2<br>
along the lines of reducing thermal capacity. With a lower level of thermal capacity it is possible in particular to achieve better cold start performance when using the honeycomb bodies in exhaust gas catalytic converters. The ignition temperature as from which the catalytic procedure begins is achieved earlier. Besides thermal capacity, the pressure drop which occurs in a gas flow through the honeycomb body also plays a part in the development involved. The pressure drop should be as low as possible. Both aims of development, namely a low thermal capacity and a low pressure drop, can be achieved by means of thin passage walls. However the passage walls cannot be made of just any arbitrarily thin dimension as the wall structure otherwise becomes unstable and is damaged under thermal and/or mechanical loadings.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an extruded honeycomb body with thin passage walls, which has a stable wall structure.<br>
According to the invention that object is attained by a honeycomb body having the features of claim 1. Advantageous developments are the subject-matter of the appendant claims. In addition, in accordance with the invention that object is attained by a honeycomb body having the features of claim 12.<br>
A honeycomb body according to the invention has passage walls of a first thickness and passage walls of a second thickness, wherein the first thickness is less than the second thickness. Passage walls of the second thickness form a lattice-like wall structure which stabilizes the honeycomb body. The lattice-like wall structure has a plurality of approximately straight wall portions which, transversely with respect to the local configuration of the honeycomb body edge, extend from a respective outside into the interior of the honeycomb body or pass through the honeycomb body. The term wall portion is used to denote passage walls, which extend into each other, of a plurality of passages.<br>
In an embodiment of the honeycomb body in accordance with the invention a plurality of the wall portions pass through the interior of the honeycomb body from an outside thereof to an oppositely disposed outside. In that way, particularly in the regions of the edge of the honeycomb body from which the wall portions pass through the interior of the honeycomb body, forces acting on the honeycomb body from the exterior thereof can be carried away without the honeycomb body suffering damage. However even in the case of wall portions of the second thickness, which do not extend through the interior of the honeycomb body, forces acting on the edge of the honeycomb body can be carried away. The wall portions extending into the interior can transmit forces onto a multiplicity of walls of the first thickness which are connected thereto and can thus distribute forces acting from the exterior, in the interior of the honeycomb body.<br><br>
3<br>
In a further embodiment of the honeycomb body a plurality of the wall portions of the second thickness extend at least to a common node at which they are connected together and which is disposed in the interior of the honeycomb body. The term node denotes a region in which at least two approximately straight wall portions are fixedly connected together. A node is an elongate connecting region of wall portions, which connecting region extends along a line. There are embodiments of the honeycomb body in which the wall portions which are connected together in the node extend from an outside to an approximately oppositely disposed outside, embodiments in which (approximately straight) wall portions terminate in the node and embodiments in which all or some of the wall portions connected in the node are extended beyond the node without reaching an oppositely disposed outside.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that honeycomb bodies with thin walls can be built in a stable structure. By virtue thereof it is for example possible to achieve a high cell density, that is to say, a large number of passages per unit area in the cross-section of the honeycomb body, without having to tolerate the disadvantage of a high pressure drop in an exhaust gas flow. A high cell density has an advantageous effect on the catalytic conversion of exhaust gases as a large catalytically operative surface area can be achieved per unit volume of the honeycomb body.<br>
In cold start phases or re-starting phases of an internal combustion engine with an exhaust gas catalytic converter, it is important for the catalytic converter to reach the ignition temperature as quickly as possible. Thin walls permit that to occur, by virtue of their low thermal capacity. The crucial consideration is that the ignition temperature is achieved at an early time, at least locally at the thin walls. There is however no need for the ignition temperature to be achieved approximately at the same time everywhere in the catalytic converter as the chemical reactions which take place after the ignition temperature is attained are exothermic. The zones in which the ignition temperature is reached or exceeded therefore rapidly spread.<br>
The use of honeycomb bodies according to the invention results in early initiation of the catalytic procedure in exhaust gas catalytic converters. With the passage walls of the first and second thicknesses being subjected to an approximately uniform incident flow of hot exhaust gas the catalytic procedure begins at the (thinner) walls of the first thickness and rapidly spreads to the walls of the second thickness. In comparison with honeycomb bodies of the same thermal capacity but only with walls of one thickness, the catalytic procedure begins more quickly. It still begins more quickly however even when the thermal capacity of the honeycomb body according to the invention is greater, as long as there are thinner walls.<br>
An advantage of the honeycomb body according to the invention is<br><br>
4<br>
that forces which act on the honeycomb body in directions which differ from the directions of the wall portions of the second thickness can also be carried away by way of the stabilizing wall structure. Particularly in the case of honeycomb bodies according to the invention whose stabilizing wall structure has at least four of the wall portions which cross at a node they are resistant to such loadings. In a development of this embodiment the at least four wall portions, in the cross-section of the honeycomb body, include between them approximately equal angles at the node. In the case of honeycomb bodies which have approximately rotationally symmetrical outside surfaces and whose passages extend through substantially parallel to the axis of rotation, the node is preferably disposed approximately on the axis of rotation. In addition there can be further nodes of the wall portions intersecting in the node disposed on the axis of rotation, with other wall portions.<br>
A further advantage of the honeycomb body according to the invention is a favourable vibration characteristic. Due to its stable construction the lattice-like wall structure is insensitive to vibration. In addition however it also reduces the vibration lengths, perpendicularly to the axial length of the honeycomb body, of the wall structure regions with exclusively thinner passage walls. Those vibration lengths can be matched to a given purpose of use of the honeycomb body. Care is to be taken to ensure that no resonance vibrations of the honeycomb structure are induced.<br>
In a development of the honeycomb body according to the invention a larger part of the passage wall surfaces in the interior of the honeycomb body is formed by the passage walls of the first thickness than by the passage walls of the second thickness. The first thickness is preferably at least 20% smaller than the second thickness.<br>
The reference to "a" thickness of a passage wall is used to denote the mean thickness of the passage wall, while the local thickness can vary by some percent of the mean thickness.<br>
In an embodiment of the honeycomb body the first thickness is of a value of between 20 µm and 60 µm, preferably about 30 µm.<br>
In an advantageous development of the honeycomb body it has an outside periphery, in the interior of which are arranged passages, wherein a plurality of wall portions extending therearound in a closed configuration, crossing the straight wall portions of the second thickness, are arranged at different, respectively approximately constant spacings relative to the outside periphery of the honeycomb body, so that regions in the form of ring segments are formed in cross-section. In a development at least some of the wall portions extending around the arrangement in a closed configuration are of the first thickness. In still another development further passage walls subdivide the ring segment-like regions, wherein said subdividing passage walls extend transversely with respect to the wall portions which extend<br><br>
5<br>
around the arrangement in a closed configuration. In yet a further development the cross-sectional areas of all passages, at least in the ring segment-like regions, are approximately equal.<br>
The object of the present invention is further attained by a honeycomb body having a plurality of passages through which a fluid can flow, wherein at least a portion of the passages is bordered and/or separated from each other with passage walls of a first thickness and at least a portion is bordered and/or separated from each other with passage walls of a second thickness, wherein moreover the first thickness is less than the second thickness and wherein the honeycomb body has a wall structure for stabilizing it, which is formed with passage walls of the second thickness.<br>
In that honeycomb body the stabilizing wall structure has a plurality of approximately straight wall portions of the second thickness, which extend from a respective location at the edge of the honeycomb body through the interior of the honeycomb body to another location at the edge. Preferably at least two of the wall portions of the second thickness begin and end at such locations at the edge of the honeycomb body.<br>
Embodiments of the honeycomb body according to the invention are described with reference to the drawing. These embodiments are examples, to which however the invention is not restricted. In the individual Figures of the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a honeycomb body with a wheel spoke-like stabilizing wall structure,<br>
Figure 2 shows a honeycomb body of oval cross-section,<br>
Figure 3 shows a honeycomb body with star-shaped stabilizing wall structure,<br>
Figure 4 shows a honeycomb body with three wall portions of the second thickness, which are connected at a node, and<br>
Figure 5 shows a honeycomb body with eight straight wall portions of the second thickness, which do not have any node relative to each other, in cross-section.<br>
Figure 1 shows a honeycomb body 11 of circular cross-sectional area, which has a wheel spoke-like wall structure 14 for stabilizing it, with four wall portions 13 of the second thickness, which cross at a node 5. The wall portions 13 pass through the interior of the honeycomb body 11 from a respective outside thereof to an oppositely disposed outside. The node 5 is disposed approximately on the axis of rotation of the honeycomb body 11. Each two adjacent wall portions 13 include between them the angle at the node 5, the angle a being approximately 45° in each case. The wheel spoke-like wall structure 14 is supplemented by the casing 6 which extends around the arrangement at the outside thereof and which imparts additional stability to the wall structure 14. In this case the casing 6 is of approximately the same thickness as the<br><br>
6<br>
wall portions of the second thickness. There are however also constructions in which the casing 6 is even thicker. Figure 1 indicates by way of example in three different regions the way in which the overall structure of the passage walls can be designed. Shown in the right-hand part of the Figure is a pattern which is formed by passage walls 2 of the first thickness. There the passages 7 are of approximately square cross-sectional areas. Individual ones of the passages 7 are defined by passage walls 3 of the second thickness, more specifically where the straight wall portions 13 of the second thickness intersect the pattern. The lower left part of Figure 1 shows wall portions 12 of the first thickness, which extend in a curved configuration and which, crossing the wall portions 13 of second thickness, are arranged at various, respectively approximately constant spacings relative to the outside periphery of the honeycomb body 11 so that regions of ring segment-like configuration in cross-section are formed between each two wall portions 12 of the first thickness and two straight wall portions 13 of the second thickness. The ring segment-like regions are subdivided by further passage walls 2 of the first thickness. In that arrangement the subdividing passage walls 2 extend in a curved configuration between each two wall portions 12 of the first thickness. The fact that the passage walls 2 do not extend in a radial direction means that the honeycomb body 11 enjoys increased elasticity. For further details of honeycomb bodies with passage walls 2 designed in that way, attention is directed to WO 94/15712. Another structure in respect of the passage walls 2 of the first thickness can be seen in the top left part of Figure 1. It differs by virtue of the straight passage walls 2 which subdivide the ring segment-like regions. The passages 7 which are formed in that way are all approximately equal in cross-section. There are further embodiments (not shown) of the honeycomb body according to the invention, in which further wall portions of the second thickness are attached to the wall portions 12 of the first thickness which extend in a curved configuration, said further wall portions connecting the wall portions 12 to the edge of the honeycomb body. Those wall portions of second thickness do not extend between the edge and the node 5.<br>
Figure 2 shows a honeycomb body 21 with an oval casing 16 which is stabilized by a stabilizing wall structure 24. Of the total of four wall portions 13 of the second thickness in the interior of the honeycomb body 21, two wall portions 13 cross at the node 5. Two further wall portions 13 additionally support the honeycomb body 21 insofar as they interconnect the two oppositely disposed outsides of the honeycomb body 21 with a flat edge surface. At the casing connecting locations 8 each two wall portions 13 of the second thickness come together at the oval casing 16.<br>
Figure 3 shows a honeycomb body 31 with a star-shaped stabilizing<br><br>
7<br>
wall structure 34. The total of six straight wall portions 23 each pass through two nodes 5. The stabilizing wall structure 34 has a total of six such nodes 5.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further embodiment. Three wall portions 13 of the second thickness connect three locations at the edge of the honeycomb body 41 to a node 5. The stabilizing wall structure 44 with the wall portions 13 subdivides the honeycomb body 41 into three equal-sized segments.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment. The stabilizing wall structure 54 has eight straight wall portions 33 which reinforce the honeycomb body 51 in particular in its outer region. The wall portions 33 do not have any nodes relative to each other. They are each attached to the edge of the honeycomb body 51 at a respective casing connecting location 8, perpendicularly to the respective tangential plane, and permit forces acting on the honeycomb body 51 approximately perpendicularly to the tangential plane to be carried away into the interior of the honeycomb body. The forces are transmitted to the structure of the passage walls 2 of the first thickness and are distributed in the interior of the honeycomb body 51.<br>
As the examples show configurations of the honeycomb body according to the invention are of a similar structure to previously known honeycomb bodies. They can be produced using the same processes at the previously known honeycomb bodies. Honeycomb bodies with stabilizing wall structures can therefore be produced at approximately the same cost.<br><br>
