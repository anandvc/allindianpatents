MAGENTA RECORDING INK COMPOSITION, INKJET<br>
RECORDING METHOD, AND INK RECORDED MATTER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a magenta<br>
recording ink composition which is suitably used for inkjet<br>
recording, superior in ejection stability, water resistance<br>
and light resistance and enables obtaining high-quality<br>
images with high-color saturation and excellent color tone,<br>
which contains at least a solid solution pigment (A)<br>
containing quinacridone, a lake pigment (B) having a<br>
xanthene structure, an aqueous solvent, and water,<br>
wherein the solid solution pigment (A) has visible light<br>
absorption peaks at wavelength ranges of from 510 nm to<br>
530 nm and from 540 nm to 560 nm, and a mass ratio (B/A)<br>
of the lake pigment (B) to the solid solution pigment (A)<br>
falls within the range of 0.1 to 5. The present invention<br>
also relates to an inkjet recording method and ink recorded<br>
matters using the magenta recording ink composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet printers have become increasingly popular<br>
because of such advantages as low-noise pollution and<br>
low-running cost, and inkjet color printers capable of<br>
printing on plain paper have also been increasingly put on<br>
the market. However, it is significantly difficult for<br>
inkjet printers to satisfy all the requirements such as color<br>
reproducibility of images, abrasion resistance, light<br>
resistance, gas resistance, water resistance and drying<br>
property of recorded images, resistance to character<br>
feathering, resistance to bleed at boundaries between<br>
different colors (resistance to color bleed), image density<br>
uniformity at solid image parts (resistance to beading),<br>
double-sided printing property and ejection stability.<br>
Thus, in reality, an ink and a recording medium are<br>
selected in view of preferential properties in accordance<br>
with the intended use.<br>
In general, inks used in inkjet recording contain<br>
water as a main component and additionally contain a<br>
colorant, and a wetting agent such as glycerin with a view<br>
to preventing clogging. As for colorants, water-soluble<br>
dyes which enable obtaining vivid colors are commonly<br>
used. Dyes are, however, inferior in resistance to light,<br>
gases and water, and images recorded with dyes on plain<br>
paper are far from providing satisfactory image quality.<br>
To solve the problem, attempts to improve these<br>
resistances, i.e., resistance to light, gases and water, are<br>
made by improving properties of inkjet recording paper<br>
having an ink absorption layer. But, the improvements<br>
have not yet reached sufficient levels.<br>
Recently, pigments have become widely used as<br>
colorants because of their superior light resistance, gas<br>
resistance and water resistance. However, it is true that<br>
pigments are inferior in color developing property to dyes.<br>
This can be primarily explained by the fact that lights<br>
having different wavelengths and/or phases caused by<br>
multiple reflection inside pigment particles interfere with<br>
each other. That is, when pigment(s) are used as inkjet<br>
recording ink(s), a reduction in color saturation occurs on<br>
plain paper, and a reduction in glossiness occurs on inkjet<br>
recording paper. To solve the problems, attempts are<br>
made to improve color saturation by making finer pigment<br>
microparticles and to improve glossiness of pigment<br>
particles by covering the particles with polymer. Despite<br>
these improvements, there still exist a difference in color<br>
developing property between pigments and dyes.<br>
Particularly in magenta inks, quinacridone<br>
pigments are widely used for their superior color<br>
developing properties and light resistance. Quinacridone<br>
pigments, however, are somewhat more reddish in color<br>
than the standard magenta color (Japan color Ver. 2) used<br>
in printing. This tendency has become increasingly<br>
marked as an image is printed with higher image density.<br>
When an attempt is made to yield a vivid color with high<br>
image density, a resultant color inconveniently becomes<br>
more reddish. However, at the present time, there are no<br>
pigments that can achieve a color comparable to the<br>
standard magenta color with high color saturation through<br>
the use of one pigment alone. Recently, attempts to<br>
obtain high magenta color saturation are made using a<br>
solid solution of quinacridone pigment, but the desired<br>
magenta color saturation has not yet been achieved.<br>
Patent Literature 1 and other documents propose an<br>
ink using a solid solution pigment. In most cases, use of<br>
solid solution pigments makes it possible to obtain vivid<br>
colors as compared with inks which contain pigments<br>
composed of monocrystal, however, solid solution pigments<br>
are still inferior in color developing property to dyes.<br>
Meanwhile, attempts are made in Patent Literature<br>
2 through Patent Literature 6 to increase color saturation,<br>
which has been insufficient with use of one type of dye, by<br>
mixing two or more types of water-soluble dye including<br>
xanthene dyes, and to improve light resistance, which has<br>
been insufficient with use of one type of dye, by mixing<br>
dyes having higher light resistance. However, the light<br>
resistance of dyes is still insufficient, even if a plurality of<br>
dyes are mixed, it is incomparable with the light resistance<br>
of pigment inks at the present time.<br>
As an ink that satisfies both excellent light<br>
resistance obtained from pigments and excellent brilliant<br>
coloring effect obtained from dyes, Patent Literature 7<br>
proposes an ink produced by mixing Rhodamine B-based<br>
water-soluble dye and a pigment. With this method, the<br>
light resistance can be improved as close as that provided<br>
by using a pigment, however, when a penetration-type ink<br>
having low-surface tension is printed on plain paper,<br>
feathering and color bleed occur as in the case where a<br>
dye-based ink is used, resulting in incapability of<br>
obtaining an image with high-sharpness.<br>
Also, an ink produced by mixing two or more types of<br>
different organic pigments is proposed. Patent Literature<br>
8 proposes to adjust color tone and improve color<br>
saturation by adding from 0.01% to 1% of an organic<br>
pigment having a hue angle of 270 degrees to 340 degrees<br>
to a quinacridone pigment. However, even if such a small<br>
amount as 0.01% to 1% of the pigment is added, a change in<br>
color tone and a further improvement in color saturation<br>
can be little expected. In contrast, when a lake pigment<br>
(B) is added to a solid solution pigment (A) at a mass ratio<br>
(B/A) within the range of 0.1 to 5, as in the present<br>
invention, it is possible to adjust color tone and improve<br>
color saturation. Patent Literature 9 proposes an inkjet<br>
recording ink produced by mixing a quinacridone pigment<br>
and a pigment(s) of red, violet, orange, etc. in color, but<br>
the proposal is intended to achieve inks for use in color<br>
filters with more transparent and more vivid color. Thus,<br>
the object of the proposed ink differs from that of the<br>
magenta ink of the present invention.<br>
The present inventors proposed before in Patent<br>
Literature 10 a technique relevant to an ink composition<br>
containing colored polymer fine particles in which an<br>
organic pigment (solid solution pigment), an oil-soluble<br>
dye and an inorganic pigment are covered with a polymer,<br>
but the ink proposed by the technique differs from an ink<br>
according to the present invention in which an organic<br>
pigment (specific solid solution pigment) and a lake<br>
pigment are mixed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following explains a magenta recording ink<br>
composition of the present invention in detail. The<br>
magenta recording ink composition of the present<br>
invention contains at least a solid solution pigment (A)<br>
containing quinacridone and having visible light<br>
absorption peaks at wavelength ranges of from 510 nm to<br>
530 nm and from 540 nm to 560 nm, a lake pigment (B)<br>
having a xanthene structure, an aqueous solvent, and<br>
water, and may further contain other components.<br>
Hereinbelow, these components will be described more<br>
specifically.<br>
[Solid Solution Pigment (A)]<br>
The solid solution pigment (A) may be a solid<br>
solution pigment capable of forming a solid solution having<br>
visible light absorption peaks at wavelengths of 510 nm to<br>
530 nm and 540 nm to 560 nm. For example, solid<br>
solutions each consisting of a combination of a<br>
dimethyl-substituted quinacridone and an unsubstituted<br>
quinacridone, a combination of an unsubstituted<br>
quinacridone and a dichloro-substituted quinacridone, and<br>
a combination of a dimethylquinacridone and a<br>
diketopyrrolopyrrole; solid solutions each consisting of two<br>
components." and mixtures of these solid solutions are<br>
preferably exemplified. Depending on the combination<br>
selected and the mixing ratio, a more brilliant color can be<br>
obtained, as compared to the case where an organic<br>
pigment is used alone.<br>
The unsubstituted quinacridone may be any one of<br>
a-type, ß-type and ?-type, and ß-type or ?-type<br>
unsubstituted quinacridone is preferable from the<br>
viewpoint of storage stability. A mixing ratio of the two<br>
types of pigment constituting the solid solution pigment<br>
(A) is preferably 10/90 to 90/10, and more preferably 15/85<br>
to 85/15. It should be noted that the solid solution<br>
pigment (A) is not merely a mixture of the two components<br>
and is preferably composed of solid solutions derived from<br>
the two components.<br>
[Lake Pigment (B)]<br>
As the lake pigment (B), pigments having a xanthene<br>
structure such as Rhodamine B, and Rhodamine 6G are<br>
exemplified, for example. Specific examples thereof<br>
include G.I. Pigment Violet 1, C.I. Pigment Violet 2, C.I.<br>
Pigment Violet 3, C.I. Pigment Violet 81:2. Those<br>
pigments have high transparency and develop a vivid<br>
violet color.<br>
The total amount of coloring material particles of the<br>
solid solution pigment (A) and the lake pigment (B)<br>
contained in the recording ink is preferably 1% by mass to<br>
15% by mass, on solid content basis, and more preferably<br>
3% by mass to 10% by mass.<br>
[Additional pigment]<br>
- Organic pigment -<br>
In the present invention, additional pigments can be<br>
used. These additional pigments encompass pigments<br>

group in its molecules with the use of a metal salt such as<br>
aluminum, calcium and barium so as to be a pigment<br>
insoluble in water. Examples thereof include C.I.<br>

- Dispersant -<br>
After microparticulating the above-mentioned<br>
pigment(s), a dispersant is used for dispersing the<br>
microparticulated pigments in an aqueous solution so as to<br>
prepare a dispersoid. The dispersant may be suitably<br>
selected from among primarily nonionic surfactants and<br>
anionic surfactants, or polymer dispersants in accordance<br>
with the intended use.<br>
(Nonionic dispersant)<br>
Examples of the nonionic dispersants (surfactants)<br>
include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylallylethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycols,<br>
glycerin esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene ethers of glycerin esters, polyoxyethylene<br>
ethers of sorbitan esters, polyoxyethylene ethers of<br>
sorbitol esters, fatty acid alkanolamides, polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty acid amides, amine oxides, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylamines, polyoxyethylene-p-nap hthylet hers,<br>
polyoxyethylene styryl phenyl ethers, and polyoxyethylene<br>
distyryl phenyl ethers. In the present invention,<br>
dispersants each having a structure, in particular, as<br>
shown in the following Formulas (lA), (IB) and (1C) may be<br>
effectively used.<br><br>
(Anionic dispersant)<br>
Examples of the anionic dispersants (surfactants)<br>
include alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkylester<br>
sulfates, alkylallyl ether sulfates, alkyl sulfonates,<br>
sulfosuccinates, alkylallyl and alkylnaphthalene<br>
sulfonates, alkyl phosphates, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether<br>
phosphates, alkylallyl ether phosphates, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ether sulfates, polyoxyethylene styrylphenyl ether<br>
sulfates, and polyoxyethylene distyrylphenyl ether<br>
sulfates. In the present invention, dispersants each<br>
having a structure, in particular, as shown in the following<br>
Formulas (2A) and (2B) may be effectively used.<br><br>
(Polymer dispersant)<br>
Examples of the polymer dispersants include<br>
polyacrylic acids, polymethacrylic acids, acrylic<br>
acid-acrylonitrile copolymers, vinyl acetate-acrylic acid<br>
ester copolymers, acrylic acid-acrylic acid alkylester<br>
copolymers, styrene-acrylic acid copolymers,<br>
styrene-methacrylic acid copolymers, styrene-acrylic<br>
acid-acrylic acid alkylester copolymers,<br>
styrene-methacrylic acid-acrylic acid alkylester<br>
copolymers, styrene-ormethylstyrene-acrylic acid<br>
copolymers, styrene-a-methylstyrene-acrylic acid<br>

vinylacetate-crotonic acid copolymers, and vinyl<br>
acetate-acrylic acid copolymers. These dispersants may<br>
be used alone or in combination.<br>
The dispersoid is produced by the following method.<br>
Specifically, the dispersant mentioned above is dissolved<br>
in an aqueous medium, then the pigment particles are<br>
added thereto, the mixture solution thus prepared is<br>
sufficiently wetted and then agitated at high speed by<br>
means of a homogenized or kneaded and dispersed by a<br>
dispersing kneader using a ball, such as a bead mill or ball<br>
mill; a high-shear dispersing kneader like a roll mill; a<br>
ultrasonic dispersing device or the like. However, after<br>
such a kneading dispersion step, coarse particles are often<br>
contained in the resultant dispersoid, which may cause<br>
inkjet nozzle clogging of an inkjet nozzle and clogging at<br>
an ink supply path. Thus, there is a need to remove<br>
particles of 1 µm or larger in diameter using a filter or<br>
centrifuge.<br>
The amount of the dispersant added to the coloring<br>
material particles is preferably 1% by mass to 100% by<br>
mass, and more preferably 10% by mass to 50% by mass.<br>
When the amount is small, the pigment contained may not<br>
be sufficiently microparticulated. When the amount is<br>
excessively large, an excessive amount of dispersant<br>
component that is not adsorbed to the pigment adversely<br>
affects the ink properties, thereby possibly leading to<br>
image feathering and degradation in water resistance and<br>
image abrasion resistance.<br>
The mixing ratio of the dispersant to the coloring<br>
material particles in the recording ink is preferably 10% to<br>
100%, and more preferably 25% to 50%.<br>

- Water-soluble polymer -<br>
The addition of a water-soluble polymer to the<br>
recording ink of the present invention makes it possible to<br>
improve the storage stability of the ink. The<br>
water-soluble polymer may be added along with additives<br>
such as aqueous solvent and surfactants when the<br>
pigment(s) are dispersed using a dispersing device such as<br>
bead mill, and atrighter, or when a recording ink<br>
composition is prepared, however, it is more preferable to<br>
add it when preparing a recording ink composition.<br>
The water-soluble polymer used in the present<br>
invention exhibits solubility by addition of ionic groups on<br>
the polymer surface. For such ionic groups, hydroxyl<br>
groups, sulfonic groups, carboxyl groups, sulfate groups,<br>
phosphate groups, phosphonate groups, and phosphine<br>
groups or alkaline metal salt groups thereof, ammonium<br>
salt groups thereof, or primary, secondary, or tertiary<br>
amine groups are exemplified. Introduction of the ionic<br>
groups is carried out in parallel with synthesis of the<br>
polymer by adding the monomer having ionic groups.<br>
Examples of the salt groups include ammonium-based ions,<br>
Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cu and Fe. Preferred is Li, K or Na.<br>
In the present invention, the amount of the<br>
water-soluble polymer relative to the total amount of a<br>
coloring material of pigment in the ink composition is<br>
preferably 1% by mass to 50% by mass, and more preferably<br>
5% by mass to 30% by mass. When the amount of the<br>
water-soluble polymer to the pigment is less than 1% by<br>
mass, sufficient dispersion stability may not be obtained.<br>
When it is more than 50% by mass, the ejection of the<br>
resultant ink becomes unstable due to the high-viscosity of<br>
the tine, thereby possibly leading to nozzle clogging.<br>
- Polymer microparticles and polymer emulsion -<br>
The polymer microparticles or the polymer emulsion<br>
used in the present invention can be obtained by a<br>
conventionally known method, e.g. by emulsification<br>
polymerization of the polymer in water in presence of a<br>
polymerizable catalyst and an emulsifier.<br>
The polymer microparticles and polymer emulsion<br>
can exhibit superior water dispersibility by incorporation<br>
of ionic groups on the surfaces. For such ionic groups,<br>
sulfonic groups, carboxyl groups, sulfate groups,<br>
phosphate groups, phosphonate groups, and. phosphine<br>
groups or alkaline metal salt groups thereof, ammonium<br>
salt groups thereof, or primary, secondary, or tertiary<br>
amine groups are exemplified. Preferred are carboxylic<br>
acid-alkali metal salt groups, carboxylic acid-ammonium<br>
salt groups, sulfonic acid-alkali metal salt groups and<br>
sulfonic acid-ammonium salt groups, with sulfonic<br>
acid-alkali metal salt groups and. sulfonic acid-ammonium<br>
salt groups being particularly preferred. Introduction of<br>
the ionic groups is carried out in parallel with synthesis of<br>
the polymer by adding the monomer having ionic groups.<br>
Examples of the salt groups include ammonium-based ions,<br>
Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cu and Fe. Preferred is Li, K or Na.<br>
In the present invention, the amount of the polymer<br>
microparticles or polymer emulsion to the ink composition<br>
is preferably 0.5% by mass to 20% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 1% by mass to 5% by mass. When the amount is<br>
less than 0.5% by mass, sufficient abrasion resistance and<br>
water resistance may not be obtained. When it is more<br>
than 20% by mass, the ejection of the resultant ink<br>
becomes unstable due an increase in viscosity of the ink,<br>
resulting from air-drying, thereby possibly leading to<br>
nozzle clogging.<br>
- Dispersion of pigment by polymer coating -<br>
The pigment can be dispersed in an aqueous medium<br>
by making the pigment into microparticles and coating the<br>
surface thereof with the polymer. For the coating, all<br>
conventionally known methods, such as microcapsulation<br>
or emulsification, may be employed. Examples of the<br>
conventionally known methods include chemical<br>
production methods, physical production methods, physical<br>
and chemical treatments, and mechanical production<br>
methods.<br>
More specifically, the dispersion methods of pigment<br>
by polymer coating are as follows:<br>
• Acid separation method (a method in which at<br>
least part of anionic groups of organic polymer compounds<br>
containing the anionic groups is neutralized using a basic<br>
compound; in accordance with this, solubility to water is<br>
provided and the solubility-provided anionic groups are<br>
mixed and kneaded along with a coloring material in an<br>
aqueous medium, and then, the resultant substance is<br>
made neutral or acidic using acidic compounds, organic<br>
compounds are separated and bonded to the coloring<br>
material, and then the substance is neutralized and<br>
dispersed);<br>
• Phase inversion emulsification method (a method<br>
in which a mixture containing anionic organic polymers<br>
which are dispersible in water and coloring material(s) is<br>
prepared as an organic solvent phase, and water is<br>
introduced to the organic solvent phase or the organic<br>
solvent phase is introduced to water);<br>
• Interfacial polymerization method (a method of<br>
forming a wall film in which two types of monomers or two<br>
types of reactants are separately dissolved in a dispersed<br>
phase and a continuous phase and then the wall film is<br>
formed by reacting both materials at a phase boundary<br>
thereof);<br>
• In-situ polymerization method (a method in which<br>
two types of materials, namely, a liquid or gaseous<br>
monomers and a catalyst or a reactive material are<br>
supplied from one side of nuclear particles of continuous<br>
phase so as to cause a reaction, thereby forming a wall<br>
film);<br>
• In-liquid cure coating method (a method of forming<br>
a wall film in which droplets of a polymer solution<br>
containing core material particles are insolubilized in the<br>
liquid using a curing agent or the like, thereby forming a<br>
wall film);<br>
• Coacervation (phase separation) method (a method<br>
of forming a wall film in which a polymer-dispersed liquid<br>
containing core material particles dispersed therein is<br>
separated into a coacervate with a high, concentration, of<br>
polymers (dense phase) and a sparse phase, and a wall film<br>
is formed);<br>
• In-liquid drying method (a method of forming a<br>
wall film in which a liquid containing core materials in a<br>
solution of wall film materials is prepared and a dispersion<br>
liquid is supplied to the liquid where a continuous phase of<br>
the dispersion liquid is not miscihle so as to have a<br>
complex emulsion, and then a wall film is formed by<br>
gradually removing medium into which the wall film<br>
materials are dissolved);<br>
• Fusion dispersion cooling method (a method of<br>
forming a wall film, in which wall film materials which are<br>
fused upon heating and are solidified at normal<br>
temperature are used, the materials are heated to be a<br>
liquid, and core material particles are dispersed thereinto,<br>
the core material particles are made to be microparticles<br>
and cooled, thereby forming a wall film);<br>
• Air suspension coating method (a method of<br>
forming a wall film in which core material particles in a<br>
powder form are suspended in the air using a fluidized bed,<br>
and a coating liquid is sprayed and mixed with the core<br>
material particles floating in an airflow, and then a wall<br>
film is formed); and<br>
• Spray drying method (a method of forming a wall<br>
film in which an undiluted encapsulating solution is<br>
sprayed and brought into contact with a heated air, and a<br>
wall film is formed by allowing a volatile component to be<br>
evaporated and dried).<br>
In particular, the phase inversion emulsification<br>
method, acid separation method, and interfacial<br>
polymerization method are employed in inkjet process.<br>
The mixing ratio of the coating polymer to the<br>
coloring material of pigment in the recording ink is<br>
preferably 30% to 200%, and more preferably 50% to 120%.<br>
- Penetrant -<br>
Addition of a penetrant to ink makes it possible to<br>
decrease the surface tension of the resultant ink and to<br>
promote penetration of the ink into a recording medium<br>
such as paper after ink droplets adhere to the recording<br>
medium, thereby making it possible to reduce occurrence of<br>
feathering and color bleed. The desired surface tension<br>
range in the present invention is 35mN/m or lower. As<br>
the penetrant, an anionic surfactant or a nonionic<br>
surfactant is usually used, and it should be selected<br>
depending on the type of coloring material and the<br>
combination of wetting agent and an aqueous organic<br>
solvent used within such a range that the dispersion<br>
stability is not impaired.<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactant include<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetate salts, dodecylbenzene<br>
sulfonates, laurates, and salts of polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
ether sulfates.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactants include<br>
polyols, glycol ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl amines, polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
amides, and acetylene glycols.<br>
For the acetylene glycol-based surfactants, acetylene<br>
glycol-based surfactants such as<br>
2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-desine-4,7-diol,<br>
3,6-dimethyl-4-octine-3,6-diol, and<br>
3,5-dimethyl-1-hexine-3-ol, (e.g. SURFINOL 104, 82, 465,<br>
485 or TG available from Air Products and Chemicals Inc.<br>
(U.S)) may be used. Particularly, SURFINOL 465, 104<br>
and TG can provide superior printing quality.<br>

In General Formula (8), each of p and q is an integer<br>
of 0 to 40.<br>
[Aqueous Solvent]<br>
- Wetting agent -<br>
In the ink of the present invention, water is used as<br>
a liquid medium, and with a view to preventing the ink<br>
from being dried, improving the dispersion stability and<br>
for other purposes, the following aqueous solvents are used.<br>
Note that these aqueous solvents may be used in<br>
combination in the form of mixture.<br>
Specific examples thereof include polyhydric<br>
alcohols such as glycerin, diethylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
3-methyl-l,3-butanediol, triethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, trimethylolpropane,<br>
trimethylolethane, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, tetraethylene<br>
glycol, hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene<br>
glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerol,<br>
1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,3-butanetriol, and<br>
petriol; polyhydric alcohol alkyl ethers such as ethylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and propylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether; polyhydric alcohol aryl ethers such<br>
as ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, and ethylene glycol<br>
monobenzyl ether; nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,3- imidazolidinone,<br>
e-caprolactam or ?-butyrolactone; amides such as<br>
formamide, N-methyl formamide, N, N-dimethyl<br>
formamide; amines such as monoethanolamine,<br>
dimethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoethylamine,<br>
diethylamine, and triethylamine; sulfur-containing<br>
compounds such as diemthylsulfoxide, sulfolane, and<br>
thiodiethanol; propylene carbonate, and ethylene<br>
carbonate.<br>
As additional wetting agents, those containing<br>
sugar are preferred. Examples of the sugar include<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides<br>
(including trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide) and<br>
polysaccharides. Preferred examples thereof include<br>
glucose, mannose, fructose, ribose, xylose, arabinose,<br>
galactose, maltose, eellobiose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose,<br>
and maltotriose. Note that the term "polysaccharides"<br>
means general polysaccharides, including substances that<br>
exist widely in nature, such as crcyclodextrin, and<br>
cellulose.<br>
Examples of derivatives of these sugars include<br>
reducing sugars of the above-mentioned sugars (e.g. sugar<br>
alcohols which are represented by the general formula,<br>
HOCH2(CHOH)nCH2OH (where n is an integer of 2 to 5),<br>
oxidized sugars (e.g. aldonic acids, and uronic acids),<br>
amino acids, and thio acids. Of these, sugar alcohols are<br>
preferred. Specific examples thereof include maltitol,<br>
and sorbitol.<br>
In the present invention, in particular, it is possible<br>
to produce an ink superior in storage stability and ejection<br>
stability by using, as a wetting agent, an aqueous solvent<br>
of glycerin, 1,3-b.utanediol, 3-metyhyl-l,3-butanediol,<br>
hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol,<br>
1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, propylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, or trimethylolpropane.<br>
The mixing ratio between coloring material<br>
microparticles and the wetting agent significantly affects<br>
the ejection stability of the resultant ink ejected from an<br>
inkjet head. When the amount of the wetting agent<br>
blended is small, though the solid content of coloring<br>
material microparticles is high, the water evaporation in<br>
the vicinity of an ink meniscus is promoted to cause an<br>
ejection defect.<br>
The amount of the wetting agent blended in the ink<br>
is preferably 10% by mass to 50% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 15% by mass to 40% by mass. An ink<br>
containing a wetting agent within this range achieves<br>
exceptionally satisfactory test results of drying property,<br>
storage stability and reliability.<br>
- pH adjustor -<br>
It is possible to stabilize the dispersed condition<br>
and the ejection of the resultant ink by adding a pH<br>
adjustor to the ink composition so as to keep it alkaline.<br>
When the pH of the ink is 11 or higher, the amount of the<br>
inkjet head and ink supply unit eluted is large, causing<br>
problems such as ink degeneration, ink leakage and<br>
ejection defects. It is more preferable to add a pH<br>
adjustor when the pigment is kneaded and dispersed with<br>
the dispersant in water rather than to add it with<br>
additives such as the wetting agent and penetrant after<br>
kneading and dispersion treatment. This is because some<br>
pH adjustors break the dispersion by being added to<br>
aqueous media. The pH adjustor preferably contains at<br>
least one or more types of alcohol amines, alkali metal<br>
hydroxides, ammonium hydroxides, phosphonium<br>
hydroxides and alkali metal carbonates. Examples of the<br>
alcohol amines include diethanolamine, triethanolamine,<br>
and 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol. Examples of the<br>
alkali metal hydroxides include lithium hydroxides,<br>
sodium hydroxides, and potassium hydroxides. Examples<br>
of the ammonium hydroxides include ammonium<br>
hydroxides, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, and<br>
quaternary phosphonium hydroxides. Examples of the<br>
alkali metal carbonates include lithium carbonates,<br>
sodium carbonates, and potassium carbonates.<br>
Further, to the recording ink composition of the<br>
present invention, conventionally known additives may be<br>
suitably selected and added. Examples of the additives<br>
include resin emulsions, antiseptic antifungal agents,<br>
anti-corrosion agents, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers,<br>
oxygen absorbers, light absorbers and anti-kogation<br>
agents.<br>

- Anti-kogation agent -<br>
An anti-kogation agent may be added to a recording<br>
liquid used in the present invention.<br>
The term "kogation" is a problem that could be<br>
caused in a thermal head which is adapted to eject a<br>
recording liquid by utilizing a foaming effect of the<br>
recording liquid when a current is applied to a heater so as<br>
to instantaneously heat the recording liquid, and which<br>
means a phenomenon that the recording liquid components<br>
deteriorate when heated, causing adhesion of deteriorated<br>
matters (burnt deposits of ink components) onto the heater.<br>
When kogation occurs, heating by heater is not normally<br>
performed, resulting in weaken its ejection force, in the<br>
worst case, causing no ejection of the recording liquid.<br>
As the anti-kogation agent, polyphosphoric acids,<br>
polyaminocarboxylic acids, aldonic acids,<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids, polyol phosphate esters, and salts<br>
thereof, or acids having an amino group and/or salts<br>
thereof, or ammonium salts of acids having a methyl group<br>
or a methylene group and carboxyl group are exemplified.<br>
Examples of the polyphosphoric acids include<br>
pyrophosphoric acids, tripolyphosphoric acids, and<br>
hexametaphosphoric acids.<br>
Examples of the polyaminocarboxylic acids include<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid, malonic acid,<br>
succinic acid, and glutaric acid; ethylenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acids, iminodiacetic acids, and nitrilotriacetic<br>
acids.<br>
Examples of the aldonic acids include glycolic acids,<br>
glyceric acids, gluconic acids, galactonic acids, and<br>
glucoheptonic acids.<br>
Examples of the hydroxycarboxylic acids (sometimes<br>
called oxycarboxylic acids) include citric acids, malic acids,<br>
lactic acids, glycolic acids, glyceric acids, mandelic acids,<br>
and tartaric acids.<br>
Examples of the polyol phosphate ester include<br>
a-glycerophosphoric acids, and ß-glycerophosphoric acids.<br>
Among these, hydroxycarboxylic acids<br>
(oxycarboxylic acids) such as citric acids, lactic acids,<br>
gluconic acids (when gluconic acids are in the form of<br>
solids, they exist as d-gluconolactone or ?- gluconolactone),<br>
and tartaric acids; and a-glycerophosphoric acids and<br>
ß-glycerophosphoric acids etc. are preferable because they<br>
are highly soluble in water. Further, citric acids and<br>
gluconic acids are particularly preferable. Note that<br>
these compounds may be used in the form of acids or salts.<br>
More specifically, these compounds may be used in the form<br>
of alkali metal salts, ammonium salts or organic amine<br>
salts such as triethanolamine, dimethanolamine,<br>
monoethanolamine, and triisopropanolamine.<br>
When any of these compounds are used,<br>
commercially available compounds in the form of salts may<br>
be directly used or may be used after adding thereto an<br>
alkali agent so as to be in the form of salts of organic acids.<br>
As the alkali agent used on that occasion, lithium,<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
ammonia water (ammonium hydroxide), and organic<br>
amines (e.g. triethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
monoethanolamine, diisopropanolamine,<br>
triisopropanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, and<br>
tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide) are exemplified.<br>
Among the alkali agents described above, it is preferred to<br>
use ammonium salts.<br>
When an ink according to the present invention is<br>
produced, the above-mentioned anti-kogation agents may<br>
be used alone or in combination. It is preferable to use<br>
the anti-kogation agent in a total amount of 0.005% by<br>
mass to 20% by mass to the total amount of the resultant<br>
recording liquid. The total amount of the anti-kogation<br>
agent is more preferably in the range of 0.05% by mass to<br>
12% by mass. By adjusting the total amount of the<br>
anti-kogation agent to the resultant recording liquid to<br>
fall within the above range, it is possible to yield an ink<br>
which has an advantageous effect of reducing kogation and<br>
is least likely to cause nozzle clogging in recording heads.<br>
Examples of the acids having an amino group and/or<br>
salts thereof include acids having an amino group such as<br>
amidosulfuric acid (sometimes called sulfaminic acid),<br>
aminomethanesulfonic acid, taurine (sometimes called<br>
2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), carbamic acid, glycin,<br>
alanine, asparaginic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine,<br>
leucine, isoleucine, threonine, triptophan,<br>
valinemethionine, and lysine. Among these, compounds<br>
having a sulfone group are preferable in terms that they<br>
are highly soluble in water and have an advantageous<br>
effect of prolonging the operating life of recording heads,<br>
as mentioned above. Specific examples of the compounds<br>
having a sulfone group include amidosulfuric acid<br>
(sulfaminic acid), aminomethanesulfonic acid, and taurine<br>
(2-aminoethanesulfonic acid). Among these, taurine<br>
(2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is particularly preferable in<br>
terms of availability.<br>
Meanwhile, when the above-mentioned acid having<br>
an amino group and/or salts thereof are used; commercially<br>
available compounds in the form of salts may be directly<br>
used or may be used after adding thereto the following<br>
alkali agents so as to be in the form of salts of organic<br>
acids. Examples of the alkali agents include lithium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
ammonia water (ammonium hydroxide), and organic<br>
amines (e.g. triethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
monoethanolamine, diisopropanolamine,<br>
triisopropanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, and<br>
tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide). Among these, it is<br>
preferred to use ammonium salts of organic acids having<br>
an amino group.<br>
These compounds may he used alone or in<br>
combination. The total amount of the acids having an<br>
amino group and/or salts thereof contained in the total<br>
amount of the resultant recording liquid is preferably<br>
0.005% by mass to 20% by mass, and more preferably 0.05%<br>
by mass to 12% by mass. By adjusting the total amount of<br>
the acids having an amino group and/or salts thereof to the<br>
resultant recording liquid to fall within the above range<br>
provided that the acids and/or salts are present with any of<br>
the above-mentioned polyphosphoric acids,<br>
polyaminocarboxylic acids, aldonic acids,<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids, polyol phosphate esters or salts<br>
thereof, it is possible to yield an ink which has an<br>
advantageous effect of reducing kogation and is least<br>
likely to cause nozzle clogging in recording heads.<br>
In the ink of the present invention, a mass ratio of<br>
the total amount of the polyphosphoric acid,<br>
polyaminocarboxylic acid, aldonic acid, hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acid, polyol phosphate ester or salts thereof contained in<br>
the ink relative to the total amount of the acids having an<br>
amino group and/or salts thereof in the ink preferably falls<br>
within the range of 20-1 to 1:20. When the mass ratio<br>
falls within the above range, it is possible to sufficiently<br>
exert the effect of reducing kogation on heater surfaces<br>
and to effectively prevent damage to outermost surfaces of<br>
protective layers.<br>
The above-mentioned ammonium salts having a<br>
methyl group or a methylene group and a carboxyl group<br>
preferably have visually little effect on the color tone of<br>
ink. In other words, an aqueous solution itself composed<br>
of the acids is preferably colorless. Also, it is preferable<br>
that the number of atoms per molecule of the acids be 10 or<br>
less and the number of oxygen atoms per molecule of the<br>
acids be 3 to 6. Specific examples of such acids include<br>
malonic acids, succinic acids, glutaric acids, adipic acids,<br>
lactic acids, malic acids, asparaginic acids, and glutamic<br>
acids.<br>
These ammonium salts having a methyl group or a<br>
methylene group and a carboxyl group may be used alone or<br>
in combination. Further, the total amount of at least one<br>
compound selected from the ammonium salts of acids<br>
having a methyl group or a methylene group and a carboxyl<br>
group is, in view of sufficient effect of reducing kogation<br>
and causing less clogging of inkjet recording heads, 0.005%<br>
by mass to 20% by mass to the total amount of the<br>
resultant ink, with the range of 0.05% by mass to 15% by<br>
mass being more preferable.<br>
Also, in order to prevent kogation from occurring, it<br>
is effective to adjust phosphorous concentration of the<br>
recording liquid. By adjusting the phosphorous<br>
concentration to 500 ppm or less, it is possible to<br>
effectively prevent occurrence of kogation even after<br>
long-time storage of the ink, and the ink exhibits stable<br>
ejection properties, making it possible to obtain<br>
high-quality images.<br>
The mechanism that an ink having high phosphorous<br>
concentration promotes formation of kogation on a heater<br>
and rapidly reduces the ink ejection amount can be<br>
considered as follows. Inorganic phosphorous compounds<br>
in an ink are heated in nozzles by a heater, create<br>
compounds together with calcium which is eluted from<br>
wetted materials in the ink and/or in the nozzles or tank<br>
etc., and the compounds adhere to the heater surface.<br>
Compounds derived from phosphorous and calcium<br>
(calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, etc.) are very hard,<br>
poorly soluble and are neither re-dispersed nor peeled off.<br>
Therefore, it is considered that once the compounds adhere<br>
onto a heater, burnt deposits of the pigment ink which have<br>
been peeled off or re-dispersed by the effect of cavitation<br>
increasingly adhere onto the heater, and whereby burnt<br>
deposits of carbon, which would be unlikely to occur when<br>
the burnt phosphorus residues do not exist, are produced<br>
at an accelerating pace to inhibit foaming of the recording<br>
liquid, resulting in a rapid reduction in ejection amount of<br>
the recording liquid. The reason why the adhesion of<br>
burnt carbon deposits is promoted by a small amount of<br>
burnt calcium deposits is not clear, but it is presumed<br>
because minute convexo-concave portions are caused on a<br>
surface of a heater by the adhesion of burnt deposits of<br>
phosphorous and calcium, and burnt carbon deposits get<br>
into the concave portions.<br><br>
Hereinbelow, a recording liquid cartridge housing a<br>
recording liquid of the present invention, and an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus equipped with a recording liquid<br>
cartridge will be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. However, the following<br>
describes a configuration of an inkjet recording apparatus<br>
and a configuration of a recording liquid cartridge, and<br>
should not be construed as limiting the present invention,<br>
in any way.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic front view exemplarily showing<br>
a configuration of a mechanical unit of a serial type inkjet<br>
recording apparatus mounted with an ink cartridge<br>
accommodating therein a recording liquid of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The mechanical unit of the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus has side plates (1) and (2) at both sides thereof,<br>
and a main guide rod (3) and a secondary support guide rod<br>
(4) substantially horizontally extend between the side<br>
plates (1) and (2) and slidably support a carriage unit (5)<br>
in a main scanning direction. The carriage unit (5) has<br>
four heads (6) so that their ejection surfaces (nozzle<br>
surfaces) (6a) face downward. The four heads (6)<br>
discharge a yellow (Y) ink, magenta (M) ink, cyan (C) ink<br>
and black (Bk) ink, respectively. Further, the carriage<br>
unit (5) is loaded with four ink cartridges (7y), (7m), (7c)<br>
and (7k) above the heads (6) in an exchangeable manner,<br>
the ink cartridges serving as ink suppliers for feeding each<br>
of the color inks to the four heads (6).<br>
The carriage unit (5) is connected to a timing belt<br>
(11) which is spanned between a driving pulley (driving<br>
timing pulley) (9) and a driven pulley (idler pulley) (10),<br>
and the driving pulley (9) is rotated by a main scanning<br>
motor (8). The carriage unit (5), namely the four heads<br>
(6), is designed to move in the main scanning direction by<br>
driving and controlling the main scanning motor (8).<br>
Subframes (13) and (14) are vertically arranged on a<br>
base plate (12) connecting between the side plates (1) and<br>
(2). Between the Subframes (13) and (14) is rotatably<br>
held a conveyance roller (15) for conveying a paper (16) in<br>
a secondary scanning direction perpendicular to the main<br>
scanning direction. A secondary scanning motor (17) is<br>
arranged on the side of the Subframe (14). To transmit<br>
the rotation of the secondary scanning motor (17) to the<br>
conveyance roller (15), a gear (18) is fixed to the rotation<br>
shaft of the secondary scanning motor (17), and another<br>
gear (19) is fixed to the shaft of the conveyance roller (15).<br>
Further, a mechanism (21) for maintaining and<br>
improving reliability of the heads (6) (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "subsystem") is arranged between the side plate (1)<br>
and the subframe (13). The subsystem (21) is configured<br>
in the following manner. Four'cap means (22) for capping<br>
ejection surfaces of the heads (6) is held by a holder (23).<br>
The holder (23) is rockably held by a link member (24).<br>
When the carriage unit (5) moves in the main scanning<br>
direction and comes in contact with a catching part (25)<br>
arranged on the holder (23), the holder (23) is lifted up to<br>
thereby allow the capping means (22) to cap the ejection<br>
surfaces (6a) of the ink-jet heads (6). When the carriage<br>
unit (5) moves toward a printing area, the holder (23) is<br>
lifted down to thereby allow the cap means (22) to depart<br>
from the ejection surfaces (6a) of the ink-jet heads (6).<br>
Each of the cap means (22) is connected to a suction<br>
pump (27) via a suction tube (26), has an air release port<br>
and hereby communicates to the air via an air release tube<br>
and an air release valve. The suction pump (27) aspirates<br>
a waste liquid and discharges the same to a waste reservoir<br>
(not shown) typically via a drain tube.<br>
A wiper blade (28) is fixed to a blade arm (29) at the<br>
side of the holder (23). The wiper blade (28) is wiping<br>
means for wiping the ejection surfaces (6a) of the ink-jet<br>
heads (6) and is composed of a fibrous material, foaming<br>
material or elastic material such as rubber. The blade<br>
arm (29) is rockably pivoted and is rocked by the rotation<br>
of a cam which is rotated by a driving means (not shown).<br>
The ink cartridge (7) will be illustrated below with<br>
reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 is an external<br>
perspective view of an ink cartridge before loaded to a<br>
recording apparatus, and FIG. 3 is a front cross-sectional<br>
view of the ink cartridge.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3, an ink cartridge (7) has a<br>
cartridge main body (41) housing an ink absorber (42)<br>
which absorbs an ink of predetermined color. The<br>
cartridge main body (41) is made of typically a resinous<br>
molded article and is composed of a case (43) having a wide<br>
opening on its top and an upper lid member (44) bonded or<br>
melt-fixed to the top opening. The ink absorber (42) is<br>
composed of a porous material such as a urethane foam, is<br>
compressed and inserted into the cartridge main body (41)<br>
before absorbing the ink.<br>
The case (43) of the cartridge main body (41) has an<br>
ink supply port (45) at its bottom for supplying the ink to<br>
the recording head (6), and a sealing ring (46) is engaged<br>
to the inner wall of the ink supply port (45). The upper<br>
lid member (44) has an air release port (47).<br>
The cartridge main body (41) has a capping member<br>
(50). The capping member (50) serves to cover the ink<br>
supply port (45) before loading of the cartridge and to<br>
prevent the inside ink from leaking when the cartridge is<br>
handled typically in loading, transporting or<br>
vacuum-packaging and a pressure is applied to the wide<br>
side walls to thereby compress and deform the case (43).<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, the air release port (47)<br>
has a film sealing member (55) having an oxygen<br>
permeability of 100 mL/m2or more affixed to the upper lid<br>
member (44) to seal the same. The sealing member (-55)<br>
has such a size as to cover and seal the air release port (47)<br>
as well as plural grooves (48) arranged around the air<br>
release port (47). The air release port (47) is thus sealed<br>
by the sealing member (55) having an oxygen permeability<br>
of 100 mL/m2 or more, and in addition, the ink cartridge (7)<br>
is packaged under reduced pressure with a packaging<br>
member such as a gas-impermeable aluminum laminated<br>
film. This configuration can increase the deaeration of<br>
the ink even if the ink contains dissolved gas due to the air<br>
contaminated during ink charging or the air in a space (A)<br>
(FIG. 3) formed between the ink absorber (42) and the<br>
cartridge main body (41), since the air in the ink is<br>
exhausted to a highly vacuum space between the cartridge<br>
main body (41) and the outer packaging member via the<br>
sealing member (55).<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a configuration of a recording<br>
cartridge having a recording liquid container housing the<br>
recording liquid of the present invention, and a head unit<br>
for ejecting droplets of the recording liquid.<br>
More specifically, a recording unit (30) is a serial<br>
type recording unit and mainly consists of an ink-jet head<br>
(6), an ink tank (41) housing the recording liquid to be<br>
supplied to the ink-jet head (6), and a lid member sealing<br>
the ink tank (41). The ink-jet head (6) has a plurality of<br>
nozzles (32) for ejecting the recording liquid. The<br>
recording liquid is fed from the ink tank (41) via an ink<br>
supply tube (not shown) to a common chamber (not shown)<br>
and is ejected from the nozzles (32) according to an electric<br>
signal inputted through an electrode (31) from the<br>
recording apparatus main body. The recording unit of this<br>
type has a structure suitable for a "thermal" or "bubble"<br>
head driven by action of heat energy. This type of head<br>
can be prepared at low cost.<br>
The serial ink-jet recording apparatus is taken as an<br>
example in the above description, but the recording liquid<br>
of the present invention can also be applied to a recording<br>
apparatus having a "line head", in which nozzles and other<br>
components are integrated at a density of equal to or one<br>
severa.lths the resolution of the target image in an optional<br>
arrangement such as staggered arrangement and in a<br>
width larger than that of a recording medium used.<br>
The "recording apparatus" used herein may be an<br>
output printer for personal computers or digital cameras,<br>
as well as an apparatus having composite functions in<br>
combination with, for example, facsimile, scanner and/or<br>
telephone.<br>

scanned with visible light of at least a wavelength range of<br>
from 340 nm to 800 nm at sampling intervals of 5 nm or<br>
less to obtain a light absorption spectrum of the undiluted<br>
solution pigment dispersoid. FIG. 5 shows visible light<br>
absorption spectrum of the solid solution<br>
pigment-containing dispersoid A7 and the pigment<br>
dispersoid C2. The resulting spectrum shows that the<br>

printer, IPSIO GX5000 manufactured by Ricoh Company<br>
Ltd., and the printer was set to a sleep mode where<br>
primarily capping and cleaning functions were inoperable<br>
during the printing operation to determine how long time,<br>
in seconds, had elapsed since a deviation of the direction of<br>
jetting liquid droplets from a predetermined direction<br>
occurred or how long time, in seconds, had elapsed since<br>
the weight of ejection liquid droplets had changed. Based<br>
on the time length results, the reliability of ejection<br>
stability of each of the inks was evaluated in accordance<br>
with the following criteria. Table 3 shows the evaluation<br>

(Evaluation of Hue Angle)<br>
After drying the printed image, a hue angle of each<br>
of the ink printed was measured using a reflective/color<br>
spectrophotometric densitometer (manufactured by X-Rite<br>
Co.). More specifically, a value of hue angle of the printed<br>
image on each printing test paper was measured, and an<br>
average value obtained from hue angle values on the three<br>
types of regular paper for the printing test and an average<br>
value obtained from hue angle values on the two types of<br>
gloss paper for the printing test were calculated.<br>
Afterward, a difference between each of the average values<br>
to the value of hue angle (Magenta color: 356.31°) of the<br>
standard color (Japan color Ver. 2) was determined. Table<br>
3 shows the resultant hue angle grades obtained from the<br>
absolute values according to the following evaluation<br>
criteria.<br><br>
A: The difference was 2° or less.<br>
B: The difference was 2° or more and less than 5°.<br>

(Evaluation of Chroma)<br>
A chroma value of each of the ink image printed<br>
above was measured using the reflective/color<br>
spectrophotometric densitometer (manufactured by X-Rite<br>
Co.). More specifically, a chroma value of the printed<br>
image on each printing test paper was measured, and an<br>
average value obtained from chroma values on the three<br>
types of regular paper for the printing test and an average<br>
value obtained from chroma values on the two types of<br>
gloss paper for the printing test were calculated.<br>
Afterward, the ratio of the average chroma value to the<br>
chroma value (Magenta color:74.55) of the standard color<br>
(Japan color Ver. 2) was determined. Table 3 shows the<br>
resultant grades obtained according to the following<br>
evaluation criteria.<br><br>
A: 0.95 or more<br>
B: 0.85 or more and less than 0.95<br>
C: 0.75 or more and less than 0.85<br>
D: less than 0.75<br>
(Evaluation of Abrasion Resistance)<br>
An ink printed portion of an image sample that had<br>
been formed on each of the above-mentioned gloss papers<br>
in a similar method to the chroma measurement was<br>
abraded back and forth 5 times with white cotton cloth<br>
under a load of 900g using a clock meter CM-1<br>
(manufactured by TOYO SEIKI Co., Ltd.). The results of<br>
the abrasion resistance (an average value obtained on the<br>
two types of exclusive recording papers, i.e. gloss papers)<br>
were evaluated according to the following criteria. Table<br>
3 shows the evaluation results.<br><br>
