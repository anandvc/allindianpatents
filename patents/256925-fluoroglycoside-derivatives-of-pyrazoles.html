Novel fluoroglycoside derivatives of pyrazoles, medicaments containing these compounds, and the use thereof<br>
The invention relates to substituted fluoroglycoside derivatives of pyrazoles, their physiologically tolerated salts and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
Several classes of substances having an SGLT effect have been disclosed in the literature. The model for all these structures was the natural product phlorizin. From this were derived the following classes which are described in the property rights below:<br>
-	propiophenone glycosides of Tanabe (WO 0280936, WO 0280935,<br>
JP 2000080041 and EP 850948)<br>

glucopyranosyloxypyrazoles of Kissei, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ajinomoto (WO     02068440,     WO     02068439,     WO     0236602,     WO 01016147, WO 02053573,     WO     03020737,     WO     03090783,     WO     04014932, WO 04019958 and WO 04018491)<br>

All the known structures contain glucose as a very important structural element.<br>
The invention was based on the object of providing novel compounds with which it is possible to prevent and treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The invention relates to compounds of the formula I in the form of their tautomers, racemates, racemic mixtures and pure enantiomers, and to their diastereomers and mixtures thereof. The present invention includes all these isomeric and, where appropriate, tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. These isomeric forms can be obtained by known methods even if not (in some cases) expressly described.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, because their solubility in water is greater than that of the starting or basic compounds, particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts) and salts of trometamol  (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol),  diethanolamine,  lysine  or<br><br>
ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
Use<br>
This invention further relates to the use of compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting SGLT 1 (sodium dependent glucose transporter 1). SGLT 1 is involved in the intestinal uptake of carbohydrates, in particular the intestinal uptake of glucose (E. Turk et al., Nature 1991, 350, 354-356). Inhibition of the absorption of glucose inhibits the rise in the blood glucose concentration. Thus, inhibitors of SGLT 1 are suitable for the treatment, control and prophylaxis of metabolic disorders, especially of diabetes mellitus.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are distinguished by beneficial effects on glucose metabolism; in particular, they lower the blood glucose level and are suitable for the<br><br>
treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The compounds can therefore be employed alone or in combination with other blood glucose-lowering active ingredients (antidiabetics).<br>
The compounds of the formula I are further suitable for the prevention and treatment of late damage from diabetes, such as, for example, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy and syndrome X, obesity, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarct, peripheral arterial occlusive diseases, thromboses, arteriosclerosis, inflammations, immune diseases, autoimmune diseases such as, for example, AIDS, asthma, osteoporosis, cancer, psoriasis, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and infectious diseases, preference being given to the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and for the prevention and treatment of late damage from diabetes, syndrome X and obesity.<br>
Formulations<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg and 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. Single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, tablets or capsules, may contain, for example, from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I<br><br>
used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; in the form of powders or granules; as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or in the form of an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound, which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are preferably in the form of single-dose suppositories. These can be produced by mixing a compound of the formula I with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping the resulting mixture.<br><br>

Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the small intestine of rabbits, rats and pigs<br>
Preparation of brush border membrane vesicles from the intestinal cells of the small intestine was carried out by the so-called Mg2+ precipitation method. The mucosa of the small intestine was scraped off and suspended in 60 ml of ice-cold Tris/HCI buffer (pH 7.1)/300 mM mannitol, 5mM EGTA. Dilution to 300 ml with ice-cold distilled water was followed by homogenization with an Ultraturrax (18 shaft, IKA Werk Staufen, FRG) at 75% of the max. power for 2 x 1 minute, while cooling in ice. After addition of 3 ml of 1M MgCI2 solution (final concentration 10 mM), the mixture is left to stand at 0°C for exactly 15 minutes. Addition of Mg2+ causes the cell membranes to aggregate and precipitate with the exception of the brush border membranes. After centrifugation at 3 000 x g (5000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 15 minutes, the precipitate is discarded and the supernatant, which contains the brush border membranes, is centrifuged at 26 700 x g (15 000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes. The supernatant is discarded, and the precipitate is rehomogenized in 60 ml of 12 mM Tris/HCI buffer (pH 7.1)/60 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA using a Potter Elvejhem homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, 900 rpm, 10 strokes). Addition of 0.1 ml of 1M MgCfe solution and incubation at 0°C for 15 minutes is followed by centrifugation again at 3000 x g for 15 minutes. The supernatant is then centrifuged again at 46 000 x g (20 000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes. The precipitate is taken up in 30 ml of 20 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol and homogeneously resuspended by 20 strokes in a Potter Elveihem homogenizer at 1000 rpm. After centrifugation at 48 000 x g (20 000 rpm, SS-34 rotor) for 30 minutes, the precipitate was taken up in 0.5 to 2 ml of Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol (final concentration 20 mg/ml) and resuspended using a tuberculin syringe with a 27 gauge needle. The vesicles were either used directly after preparation for labeling or transport studies or were stored at -196°C in 4 mg portions in liquid nitrogen. To prepare brush border membrane vesicles from rat small intestine, 6 to 10 male Wistar rats (bred at Kastengrund, Aventis Pharma) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the small intestines were removed and rinsed with cold isotonic saline. The intestines were cut up and the mucosa was scraped off. The processing to isolate brush border membranes took place as described above. To remove cytoskeletal fractions, the brush border membrane vesicles from rat small intestine were treated with KSCN as chaotropic ion.<br><br>
To prepare brush border membranes from rabbit small intestine, rabbits were sacrificed by intravenous injection of 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of 2.5 mg of tetracaine HCI, 100 mg of m-butramide and 25 mg of mebezonium iodide. The small intestines were removed, rinsed with ice-cold physiological saline and stored frozen in plastic bags under nitrogen at -80°C and 4 to 12 weeks. For preparation of the membrane vesicles, the frozen intestines were thawed at 30°C in a water bath and then the mucosa was scraped off. Processing to give membrane vesicles took place as described above.<br>
To prepare brush border membrane vesicles from pig intestine, jejunum segments from a freshly slaughtered pig were rinsed with ice-cold isotonic saline and frozen in plastic bags under nitrogen at -80°C. Preparation of the membrane vesicles took place as described above.<br>
Measurement of the glucose uptake by brush border membrane vesicles<br>
The uptake of [14C]-labeled glucose into brush border membrane vesicles was measured by the membrane filtration method. 10 µl of the brush border membrane vesicle suspension in 10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/300 mM mannitol were added at 20°C to 90  µl of a solution of 10 pM [14CJD glucose and the appropriate concentrations of the relevant inhibitors (5-200 µM) in 10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/100mMNaCI/100mM.<br>
After incubation for 15 seconds, the transport process was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (10 mM Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4)/150 mM KCI) and the vesicle suspension was immediately filtered with suction through a cellulose nitrate membrane filter (0.45 µm, 25 mm diameter, Schleicher &amp; Schull) under a vacuum of from 25 to 35 mbar. The filter was washed with 5 ml of ice-cold stop solution. Each measurement was carried out as duplicate or triplicate determination. To measure the uptake of radiolabeled substrates, the membrane filter was dissolved in 4 ml of an appropriate scintillator (Quickszint 361, Zinsser Analytik GmbH, Frankfurt am Main), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation measurement. The measured values were obtained as dpm (decompositions per minute) after calibration of the instrument using standard samples and after correction for any chemiluminescence present.<br>
The active ingredients are compared for activity on the basis of IC50 data obtained in the transport assay on rabbit small intestine brush border membrane vesicles for<br><br>
selected substances. (The absolute values may be species- and experiment-dependent).<br>
A further method for testing the activity of the compounds is the inhibition of the transport activity of the human sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1, SLC5A1) in vitro:<br>
1.	Cloning of an expression vector for human SGLT1<br>
The cDNA for human SGLT1 was introduced into the pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen) by standard methods of molecular biology as described in Sambrook et al. (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition). The subsequent sequencing of the insert revealed complete identity with bases 11 to 2005 of the base sequence for human SGLT1 which was described by Hediger et al. (Hediger et al., Proc. Nati Acad. Sci. USA 1989, 86, 5748-5752.) and deposited in the GenBank sequence database (GenBank Accesion Number: M24847). Bases 11 to 2005 correspond to the complete coding region of human SGLT1,<br>
2.	Preparation of a recombinant cell line with inducible expression of human SGLT1<br>
The expression vector for human SGLT1 was introduced into CHO-TRex cells<br>
(Invitrogen) by means of FuGene6 lipofection (Roche). To select single cell clones,<br>
600 µg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) was added to the cell culture medium (Nutrient Mixture<br>
F-12 (Ham), (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BD Biosciences),<br>
10   pg/ml   blasticidin  S   (CN   Biosciences),   100 units/ml   penicillin,   100 units/ml<br>
streptomycin). The functionality of the single cell clones resulting from the selection<br>
was tested via their uptake activity for radiolabeled methyl a-D-glucopyranoside. The<br>
cell clone with the greatest uptake activity for methyl a-D-glucopyranoside, referred to<br>
as  CHO-TRex-hSGLT1   hereinafter,  was  selected  for further  experiment,   and<br>
cultivation was continued in the presence of 600 µg/ml of zeocin.<br>
3.	Measurement of the inhibitory effect of test substances on the uptake of methyl<br>
g-D-qlucopyranoside (a -MDG)<br>
CHO-TRex-hSGLT1 cells were seeded in a concentration of 50 000 cells per well in Cytostar-T scintillating 96-well plates (Amersham Biosciences) in cell culture medium and cultivated for 24 h. Expression of the recombinant human SGLT1 was induced by adding 1 pg/ml tetracyclin for a further 24 h. For a-MDG uptake experiments, the cells were washed with PBS and then starved (PBS supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) at 37°C for one hour. After a further washing step with transport assay buffer (140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 10 mM HEPESHYis, pH 7.5), the cells were incubated either<br><br>
in the absence or presence of test substances varying in concentration at roorr temperature for 15 min. The test substances were diluted appropriately in transpor assay buffer (40 µl/well) starting from a 10 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide The assay was then started by adding 10 µl of a mixture of radiolabeled methy a-D-[U-   C]glucopyranoside (Amersham) and unlabeled methyl a-D-glucopyranoside<br>
(Acros). The final concentration of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside in the assay was 50 µM. After an incubation time of 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl/well of 10 mM methyl a-D-glucopyranoside in transport assay buffer (4°C), and the radioactivity uptake by the cells was determined in a MicroBeta Scintillation Microplate Reader (Wallac). The half-maximum inhibitory effect of the test substances (IC50) was determined in the following way:<br>
1.	Establishment of the value for 0% inhibition. This is the measurement in the<br>
absence of substance, measured in sodium-containing transport assay buffer.<br>
2.	Establishment of the value for 100% inhibition. This is the measurement in the<br>
absence of substance,  measured  in  sodium-free transport assay  buffer<br>
(140 mM  choline  chloride,  2 mM   potassium  chloride,   1 mM  magnesium<br>
chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 10mM HEPES/Tris, pH7.5).<br>
3.	Calculation of the percentage inhibitions for the measurements carried out in<br>
the presence of various concentrations of test substance. It was then possible<br>
to ascertain therefrom the concentration of test substance which reduced the<br>
uptake of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside by 50% (IC50).<br>
