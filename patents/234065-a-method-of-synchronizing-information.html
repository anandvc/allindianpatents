BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
JPiiikt of tiie Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to communication between systems. ':M:.irs particularly, :he invention relates to a communication interface to aid transferring of lata acd infonii.atio:a between systems and/or databases,<br>
IT,       Description of the Related Art<br>
Wireless devices, such as cellular triephoaes, personal digital assistants ("PDAs")* p^-jers, laptops v/iih wireless eo^eetSvity, etc., communicate packets including *oice and data o\er a wrxe'less i.;,;i:»vork. These wireless devices have installed application programming bttafacg'-s ^"AJ?!^') onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the wireless device. The API sits between i[-iO wire-Jess dtvice system software and the software application, making the wireless device functionality available to the application without requiring the m software i-avelofer to h:.sw tha specific wireless device system source code,<br>
The&amp;2- v.aeless devices typically need to communicate with other systems and natab&amp;es within the other systems. Unfortunately&gt; the wireless, device may lose a ,'jgnal dnrir.,;!, communication ox be otherwise unavailable when transmitting uforaation to other systems. This may cause errors when attempting to access a database wh;ui :he signal is lost. The wireless device ma}' be required to reinitiate fee database access anci resubmit the database request when the signal is reacquired.<br>
Exti! nctod beyon d wireless devices, often wire-baaed systems need to communicsjx; with each other but do not share a similar '"language" for communication. 'For example:, is with wireless devices, one system may need to communicate with the database fa:, (mother system to receive or insert data. To communicate with the database, the system must be aware of the database language, record and field structures, and.<br><br>
tx-iniuts in order to access tmd store information in the database. While current •:(:chuolngie:s provide for the ability for the interface between the system and the difr.\&gt;asa to include the language, structure and format of the database, this becomes rj.o.r; complex v/hi-m multiple databases., possibly requiring multiple unique database 1 :n|: uages, etc., ruied to be accessed.<br>
Furthermore:, when data is to be sent to multiple systems, or conversely received Iron multiple ^/sterns, a common interface doss not exist to integrate across the ;xn tiple systems to simplify the date transmission. This is problematic for systems ;o. lmunicating; with several other systems.<br>
T'lerefan::,, what is needed in the art is an Interface that simplifies the communication between one or multiple databases and provides reliable and secure transfer cf information between multiple systems,<br>
Cmteui methods in the art do not address this need.   Database replication . si,; 'Vices- and cu-tom built database interfaces can become very complex and unwieldy if iti altiplc database:;; need to be accessed. In addition, all systems that access the custom database must have that interface.   Also, custom built databases are required to stay c: uine for trail? anions to occur.<br>
.'31ectroiic Data Interchange (EDI) only addresses- the need for pre-defined j.i .essago type;; and content specific to electronic commerce. The EDI message formats cz&gt; not address the data exchange needs as it relates to wireless services, system ;. ltegraiion considerations and billing specificity.<br>
SUMMARY OF TIDE INVENTION<br>
Systems and methods consistent with the present invention overcome the iliortcoirun&amp;s of existing systems by allowing an application access to a device's resources bas.;d on a set of permissions associated with the application.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of processing information -.n an interface comprising receiving data in a first format from a source system, storing the data in a persistent intermediate storage, initiating the transmission of the infenaation to the target system while retaining the. information, receiving an indication that the transmission of information to the target system was unsuccessful, and reinitiating the transmission of the information to the target system. The method 0iay further include storing data received from multiple; source systems, associated with<br><br>
iriul\: pie target systems, and initiating the transmission of the data from multiple source av&amp;fc'ms to the stscciated multiple target systems. Also, the method may include :n:-ceivii)g im source system acknowledgement indicating die acknowledgement was ri :ce-. ved and remcvi:;ig the data from the persistent intermediate storage.<br>

Fi.jure 3 is a block diagram depicting the architecture of a synchronizer tool in. scface in an Mempiary embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, the sv-whroflizer roal ,305 enables tables in one RDBMS system to be synchronized with a destination sy&amp;r.:;::ii via a standard XML interface. It will be recognised by those skilled it. the ar: that 'ike; .XML language is an implementation choice and other languages may b: used. Furthermore, it will also be recognized that the synchronizer tool may be used i IP based<br>
Data ;;;!:cdved from the RDBMS 320 in the source system 310 is stored in the i [ueue 325 of the synchronizer tool 305, This data is translated into a common file ■'ormat such w, XML- By having a storage mechanism, such as a queue, the synchronizes: tool can maintain the data for the RDBMS 315 even if the source system 310 is off Una, The synchronizer tool 305 may also be implemented to provide an aclmowledgemrat to the source system 310 when the data sent to the target system 315 is repHcatec. m the RDBMS 315 (the target system may provide an acknowledgement to the s^/ncto:»nia:er tool 305 indicating this replication has occurred, acknowledge the receipt of the data, or aclcnowledge other processing was performed).<br><br>
The sourca system 310 is connected to the synchronizer tool 305. This unuection may ■:■£ !jy any comnunication mechanism, including wireless and/or wire-i3
The target system receives the information from the synchronizer tool 305 and my respond wi:h an acknowledgement to the synchronizer tool 305. Alternatively, the iyi.chromzer tool may interact directly with a subsystem in the target system 300 (such :is. ii RDSMS 315) to perform a task such as data replication.<br>
Note tha definition of a target system 300 and source .system 310 is somewhat fc!&gt;;trar/ In one instance a system may be the source system sending data to a target $^.rtem&gt; while i.n another instance the same system is acting as the target system a; 3sivin;g datfc iirom Mother system.<br>
figure A h a flowchart depicting the process of the synchronizer tool interface in ar: exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The method begins by having the source system tnmslate data into a XML format (Step 400) or some other common f.i innat. This data may be in the form of scalar data for the target system, a request for i:iform.£.tion from the target system or other information to be transferred for processing 1:3' the target, svy^tenx- Next the data is transmitted to and received by the synchronizer ;lol(Sljep40;5).<br>
The da tiii. is stored in a persistent intermediate storage (Step 405), sach as a queue within a synchronizer tool. This allows some independence between the source and iirget systems. The source system may make the request, have it stored in Hie queue md can go offline while the request gets transmitted to and/or processed by the target .system. In addition, the iaynchronizer tool may send aa acknowledgement to the source system that it received the data.<br>
The data in XML format is then transmitted from the synchronizer tool to the target system (Step 415). Note that the "data" can be any piece of information desired :o be sent ;;: the target system. It may be data used for replication into an RDBMS of<br><br>
tli;: target sjstem. .AJteniatively, it rnay be any type of command or information sent to til:. t;i rget s ystem ::t;ir possible processing by the target system. Li addition, there may be rcilfiple target systems receiving this data. The synchronization tool may queue null; pie data, tni'isriissicm requests for multiple destinations, including multi-target sysfc: m destination inquests.<br>
Ths methc-d continues to initiate the translated command on a KDBMS (Step 415,'.. MKX translating the command into the appropriate language for the RDBMS, it i* tit i Ates this command by direct access to the target system's KDBMS or by sending the oar.'inand to a processor, such as one in fee target system, for execution.<br>
If the d2.i1, i;;; received at the target (Step 420), the "Yes" branch is followed and .ij.i adaiowledgaaiant is sent to the source system (Step 425). The source system ::b:; xi&amp;ts This acknowledgement into a format readable by the source system, such as in &gt;C* IL. If the so^jrce system is not online, the acknowledgement may be queued and further attempts, may be made to the? source system to inform it that the data was triKismiued to "ho target system. The synchronizer tool may determine if the data was i;et ;i»ved by receiving an acknowledgement from the target system.<br>
If data is .received at the target as determined in Step 420, such as may occur v,ren tin targtfl system orKDBMS is offline, then the "No** branch is followed and the cU:a remains to the cueue and will re'ery (Step 430) to initiate a transmission of the data t, the UiTget :ijst'ian as described in Step 415. There are many queuing algorithms and ti me parameters possible to determine when to initiaie another transmission to the target ■;/stem. The preferred -algorithm and time is based on the processing capacity, ■•■fficier.cy, avail able resources (such as, available queuing memory) as well as other implementation factors of the systems involved.<br>
The fon-going description of an implementation of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not exhaustive and does not jmit Ihe invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practicing of the invention.
