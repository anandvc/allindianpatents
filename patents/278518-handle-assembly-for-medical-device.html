HANDLE ASSEMBLY FOR MEDICAL DEVICE<br>
A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a handle assembly and more specifically to a handle assembly mounted on a portable medical device such as patient monitoring device like portable ECG device, blood pressure monitoring system etc.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A handle is a part of, or attachment to, an object that can be moved or used by hand. The design of each type of handle involves substantial ergonomic issues. The three nearly universal requirements for a handle are as follows. The handle should have sufficient strength to support the object, or to otherwise transmit the force involved in the task served by the handle. The handle should have sufficient length to permit the hand or hands gripping it to reliably exert that force. The handle should have a sufficiendy small circumference to permit the hand or hands to surround it far enough to grip it as solidly as needed to exert that force. The other requirements of a specific handle may be listed as follows. A sheath or coating is provided on the handle to provide friction against the hand thereby reducing the gripping force needed to provide a reliable grip function to the person carrying a device. The handle should have sufficient circumference to distribute the<br>
 <br>
force comfortably and safely over the hand, especially when the handle is made up of two pieces.<br>
[0003] A patient monitoring system is widely used in hospitals and in ambulances. While shifting the patients the user / staff nurses need to carry the patient monitors with the patients on the other side. So the handle of the patient monitor has a potential risk for failure, unless the handle is properly reinforced.<br>
[0004] None of the currently available handles provided with the patient monitoring systems are not robust enough to withstand sudden shock or impact applied on the handle. Hence there is a need to provide a handle with suitable reinforcement and ruggedness to withstand any sudden impact.<br>
[0005] The US patent no. 4147443 discloses a handle formed with a handle portion fabricated with stainless steel and provided with one annular channel arranged around the handle portion. An elastomeric material is moulded on the handle portion to completely cover the handle portion to provide a seal within the channel to prevent the entry of moisture.<br>
[0006] The US patent application no. 20050222568 discloses an adjustable handle for a medical device. The handle has a frame, a transmission, a slide, a fast rack, a sheath and a cable assembly. The transmission is mounted to the frame. The slide is movably attached to the frame and coupled with the transmission. A sheath is secured to the first rack that is movably attached to the frame and coupled with the transmission.<br>
 <br>
[0007] The US patent no. 5993470 discloses a universal handle for medical instruments. The handle has two members provided movably or fixedly with respect to the housing for detachably mounting two medical instruments respectively. A biasing mechanism moves a first member towards a retracted or extended position near one end of the housing. A locking mechanism engages the first member to prevent the bias member from moving the first member. A releasing mechanism permits the movement of the bias member.<br>
[0008] The US patent application no. 2004 0260274 discloses a handle for a medical device. The device has an inner handle member and two outer handle members. An elongate sheath is attached to the inner handle member and extends axially beyond a distal end of the inner handle. A stylet provided in a lumen of the sheath is attached to one of the two outer handle members. The outer handle member is moved relative to the inner handle member to control the positioning of the components in the handle.<br>
[0009] Thus none of the currendy available handle units attached to a medical instrument is hard and rugged enough to withstand any undesirable impact or shock to avoid failure of giving away during the transportation of the medical instruments.<br>
[0010] Hence there is a need to develop a handle unit with reinforcements and ruggedness to maintain the integrity of the medical instrument during transport.<br>
 <br>
C)	OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] Primary object of the present invention is to develop a rugged handle for medical instruments to maintain the integrity of the medical instrument during the transportation of the medical instrument and to avoid the failure of the handle during transport.<br>
[0012] Another object of the present invention is to develop a handle with locators for medical instruments to simplify the assembly process of the handle units.<br>
[0013] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a handle unit formed by welding the components of the handle using the ultrasonic bonding technology to avoid the slackness of the handle.<br>
[0014] Yet another object of the present invention is to assemble a handle unit without using the temporary fasteners.<br>
D)	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
