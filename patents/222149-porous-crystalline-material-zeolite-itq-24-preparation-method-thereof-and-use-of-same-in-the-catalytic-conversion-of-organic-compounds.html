Title<br>
Porous crystalline material (zeolite ITQ-24), preparation<br>
method thereof and use of same in the catalytic<br>
conversion of organic compounds<br>
5<br>
Field of the art<br>
The  invention comes  within crystalline  zeolitic<br>
materials and their use in the catalytic conversion of<br>
organic compounds.<br>
10<br>
Prior art<br>
Zeolites are porous crystalline materials which have<br>
found important applications as catalysts, adsorbents and<br>
ion exchangers. Many of these zeolitic materials have<br>
15well-defined structures which form channels and cavities<br>
in their interior, of uniform size and shape that permit<br>
the adsorption of certain molecules, whereas they prevent<br>
other molecules of a size too large for diffusing through<br>
the pores, from passing into the interior of the crystal.<br>
20This characteristic confers molecular sieve properties on<br>
these materials. These molecular sieves can include Si<br>
and other elements of groups IIIA and IVA of the periodic<br>
table in their lattice, and/or transition metals such as<br>
Ti, V, etc., all of them tetrahedrally coordinated, the<br>
25tetrahedrons being bound by their vertices via oxygens<br>
forming a three-dimensional lattice.  In the case of<br>
containing   elements   corresponding   to   IIIA   group<br>
tetrahedrally  coordinated  in  lattice  positions,  the<br>
negative charge that is generated is compensated by the<br>
30presence of cations, such as alkalis or alkaline earths<br>
for example, which are sited in the channels and/or<br>
cavities of these materials. One type of cation can be<br>
totally or partially exchanged for another type of cation<br>
by means of ion exchange techniques, thereby being able<br>
35to vary the properties of a given silicate by selecting<br><br>
3<br>
the desired cations. In the event of these cations being<br>
protons, the resulting materials have a high degree of<br>
acidity which confers interesting catalytic properties on<br>
them.<br>
5 The use of organic catalysts as structure directing<br>
agents has so far been a highly effective method for<br>
obtaining novel zeolitic structures. It has recently been<br>
proven that the incorporation of heteroatoms other than<br>
silicon . can play an important role as structure<br>
lOdirectors, since they promote the formation of certain<br>
secondary construction subunits. So, for example, the<br>
incorporation of Ge promotes the formation four-member<br>
double rings in the final zeolites, while the<br>
incorporation of Be or Zn promotes the appearance of<br>
15three-member rings in the final materials.<br>
As a consequence of the work done in the field of<br>
zeolite synthesis, more than 140 zeolitic structures have<br>
so far been described wherein the shape, size and<br>
connectivity of their channels and/or cavities vary,<br>
20conferring on them different adsorption/diffusion<br>
properties, and therefore displaying different catalytic<br>
properties. It is thus evident that obtaining novel<br>
zeolites is an important field of development, since the<br>
possibility of having a high number of zeolites means<br>
25that a selection can be made of the structure best suited<br>
to the processes sought to be catalysed.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic porous<br>
30crystalline material characterised in that it is formed<br>
by tetrahedrally coordinated atoms bound together by<br>
means of oxygens, which comprises a unit cell containing<br>
56 tetrahedrally coordinated atoms,  known as ITQ-24,<br>
whose chemical formula in the calcined anhydrous state is<br>
35given by<br><br>
4<br>
M1/PXO2: Y02<br>
wherein:<br>
5X is at least one trivalent element,<br>
Y is at least one tetravalent element,<br>
the value of n is between 0 and 0.2 and M is at least one<br>
charge compensation cation in oxidation state p.<br>
which  possesses  an  X-ray .diffractogram  in  the<br>
10calcined  anhydrous  state  whose  most  representative<br>
reflections appear at the spacings given in table 1:<br>

22.7350	3.9178	vw<br>
22.9300	3.8849	vw<br>
15wherein the interplanar spacings, d, were calculated in<br>
Angstroms and the relative intensity of the lines is<br>
calculated as the percentage with respect to the most<br>
intense peak, and are regarded as very strong (vs) = 80-<br>
100, strong (s) = 60-80, medium (m) = 40-60, weak (w) =<br>
2020-40 and very weak (vw) = 0-20.<br>
Examples of trivalent elements in the formula given<br>
above for ITQ-24 are Al, B, Fe, In, Ga, Cr and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Examples of tetravalent elements in the formula given<br>
25above for ITQ-24 are Si, Ti, Sn; Ge and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of compensation cations in the formula<br><br>
5<br>
given above for ITQ-24 are a proton, H+ precursors such<br>
as NH4+ for example, metallic ions such as alkaline or<br>
alkaline earth metals, rare earth cations, and metals of<br>
group VIII, and also of group IIA, IIIA, IVA, Va, IB,<br>
5IIB, IIIB, IVB, VB, VIIB of the periodic table of<br>
elements, or mixtures thereof.<br>
From the given values, it can be deduced that the<br>
crystalline material ITQ-24 can be synthesised in the<br>
absence of added trivalent elements and/or compensation<br>
locations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of ITQ-24, X is selected<br>
from among B, Al and combinations thereof, and Y is Si,<br>
Ge, Ti and combinations thereof.<br>
The synthetic porous crystalline material, ITQ-24,<br>
15as prepared prior to  calcining,  possesses  an X-ray<br>
diffractogram,  whose  most  representative  reflections<br>
appear at the spacings given in table 2:<br>

27.0100	3.3066	w<br><br><br>
wherein the relative intensity is as defined above.<br>
These diffractograms were obtained with a Philips<br>
X'Pert   diffractometer   equipped  with   a   graphite<br>
25monochromator and an automatic divergence slit using Kot<br>
radiation  from  copper.  The  diffraction  data  was<br>
registered by means of steps of 29 of 0.01° wherein 9 is<br>
- the Bragg angle and with a count time of 10 seconds per<br>
step.<br>
30     It has to be borne in mind that the diffraction data<br>
for this sample listed as single lines can consist of<br>
overlapping multiples or superpositions of reflections<br>
which, under certain conditions, such as differences in<br>
crystallographic changes,  can  appear as  resolved or<br>
35partially   resolved   lines.    In   general,    the<br>
crystallographic changes can include small variations in<br>
the parameters of the unit cells and/or changes in the<br>
symmetry of the crystal, without any change talcing place<br>
in the connectivity among the atoms of the structure.<br>
40These  modifications,  which  also  include  changes  in<br>
relative intensities, can also be due to differences in<br>
the type and quantity of compensation cations, lattice<br>
composition and shape thereof, preferred orientation or<br>
the type of thermal and hydrothermal treatment undergone.<br>
45    The porous crystalline material ITQ-24 to which this<br>
invention refers is a single crystalline phase possessing<br>
a three-directional system of channels which intersect<br>
with each other. In particular, zeolite ITQ-24 possesses<br>
a first system of channels defined by 12-member rings of<br>
50tetrahedrally coordinated atoms with a channel opening of<br>
7.7 x 5.6 A, a second system of sinusoidal channels also<br>
defined by channel openings formed by 12 tetrahedrally<br>
coordinated atoms with a channel opening of 7.2 x 6.2 A,<br>
and finally a third system of channels with a channel<br><br>
7<br>
opening of 10 tetrahedrally coordinated atoms with a<br>
channel opening of 5.75 x 4.8 A. These three systems are<br>
interconnected to each other.<br>
The structure of zeolite ITQ-24 can be defined by<br>
5its unit cell, which is the smallest structural unit<br>
displaying all the symmetry elements of the material.<br>
Table 3 shows the list of positions of all the tetra-<br>
coordinated atoms contained in the unit cell for a<br>
particular embodiment of . ITQ-24. Each tetra-coordinated<br>
lOatom is bonded to its four neighbours via oxygen bridges.<br>
Given that the position of the tetra-cooordinated atoms<br>
can vary slightly depending on the presence of organic<br>
matter or water in its pores, on the chemical composition<br>
of the material or any other modification, each position<br>
15coordinate given in table 3 can be modified by ± 0.5 A<br>
without any change taking place in the connectivity of<br>
the atoms forming the structure of the zeolite ITQ-24.<br>

A second object of the present invention is a<br>
process for synthesising a crystalline material ITQ-24,<br>
which comprises at least:<br>
25    a first stage wherein a synthesis mixture comrpising<br>
at least the following:<br>
-	H2O,<br>
-	a source of at least one tetravalent element, Y,<br>
-	a structure directing agent (R), and<br>
30    - a source of hydroxide ions M',<br>
is made to react,<br>
a second stage comprising keeping the synthesis<br>
mixture at a temperature of between 80 and 200°C until<br>
crystals of said crystalline material form; and<br>
35    a third stage comprising recovering said crystalline<br>
material.<br>
In certain cases, the source of hydroxide ions can<br>
be the structure directing agent itself.<br>
The synthesis process can furthermore comprise<br>
40    a fourth stage wherein organic matter occluded in<br>
the interior of the crystalline material is eliminated by<br>
means of a treatment selected from among extraction<br>
treatments,  thermal  treatments  at  temperatures  above<br>
250°C for a period of time between 2 minutes and 25<br>
45hours, and combinations thereof.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the process,<br><br>
10<br>
the synthesis mixture can furthermore comprise a source<br>
of the trivalent element X.<br>
According  to  a  preferred  embodiment  of  the<br>
5invention, the source of the tetravalent element Y is an<br>
oxide, the source of the trivalent element X is an oxide,<br>
and the synthesis mixture has a composition, in terms of<br>
molar ratios of oxides, of<br>
YO2/X2O3       &gt; 5<br>
10    H2O/YO2       = between 1 and 50<br>
R/YO2	= between 0.05 and 3.0<br>
OH/YO2        = between 0.05 and 6.0<br>
M'2/jO/X203     = between 0 and 1.0<br>
wherein j is the oxidation state of the cation M' and can<br>
15be one or two.<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the source of the tetravalent element Y is an<br>
oxide, the source of the trivalent element X is an oxide,<br>
20and the synthesis mixture has a composition, in terms of<br>
molar ratios of oxides, of<br>
YO2/X2O3        &gt; 7<br>
H2O/YO2       = between 2 and 20<br>
R/YO2	= between 0.05 and 1.0<br>
25    OH/YO2        = between 0.1 and 2.0<br>
M'2/jO/X2O3     = between 0 and 1.0<br>
wherein j is the oxidation state of the cation M' and can<br>
be one or two.<br>
30 According to the process of the present invention,<br>
the hydroxide source M' can be selected from among a<br>
source of at least a compensation cation M, the anion of<br>
the structure directing agent and a mixture of the two.<br>
A preferred example of structure directing agent is<br>
35a    salt    of    the    dication    hexamethylene-bis<br><br>
10	11<br>
(trimethylammonium).<br>
An additional preferred example of structure<br>
directing agent is a salt of the dihydroxide of<br>
hexamethylene-bis(trimethylammonium).<br>
5    A preferred source of the tetravalent element Y is<br>
an oxide.<br>
A preferred source of the trivalent element X is an<br>
oxide.<br>
A preferred source of the compensation cation M is a<br>
lOhydroxide or an oxide.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the process,<br>
fluoride ions are added to the synthesis mixture in a<br>
molar ratio F~/YO2 equal to or less than 0.02. For<br>
example, in a particular embodiment, ammonium fluoride<br>
15can be added in a molar ratio F-/ SiO2 less than 0.01, in<br>
the case in which Y is Si.<br>
The zeolite ITQ-24 can essentially be prepared as a<br>
pure phase or with very small amounts of impurities which<br>
can even be undetectable by X-ray diffraction.<br>
20     In the synthesis process of ITQ-24, hydroxide ions<br>
can be used as mobilising agents of the trivalent and<br>
tetravalent element oxides, which are introduced in the<br>
synthesis means as the hydroxide of an organic cation,<br>
inorganic cation or mixtures thereof, being able to be<br>
25occluded  in  the  interior  of  the  organic  species<br>
structure, which can be eliminated by conventional means.<br>
So,  the organic component can be eliminated by,  for<br>
example, extraction, or by thermal treatment by heating<br>
to a temperature of above 250 °C for a- period of time<br>
30between 2 minutes and 25 hours.<br>
The compensation cations in the material in its<br>
uncalcined form, or following thermal treatment, can, if<br>
present, be exchanged for other cations such as metallic<br>
ions, H+ and H+ precursors such as NH4+. Among the cations<br>
35that can be introduced by ion exchange, those which can<br><br>
12<br>
play a positive role in the activity of the material as a<br>
catalyst are preferred, and more specifically, cations<br>
such as H+, cations of rare earths and metals of group<br>
VIII, as well as of group IIA, IIIA, IVA, Va, IB, IIB,<br>
5IIIB, IVB, VB, VIIB of the periodic table of elements are<br>
preferred.<br>
The crystallisation of ITQ-24 can be carried out<br>
statically  or  with  stirring,  in  autoclaves  at  a<br>
temperature between 80 and 200 °C, at a sufficient length<br>
lOof time for achieving the crystallisation, for example<br>
between 12 hours and 60 days.<br>
It must be borne in mind that the components of the<br>
synthesis mixture can come from different sources, and<br>
depending on them the crystallisation times and<br>
15conditions can vary. With the aim of facilitating the<br>
synthesis, crystals of ITQ-24 can be added as seeds to<br>
the synthesis mixture, in amounts of up to 15% by weight<br>
with respect to the total components constituting the<br>
source of the elements X, Y and M. These can be added to<br>
20the synthesis mixture in advance, during the first stage<br>
of the process, or during the crystallisation of ITQ-24,<br>
in other words, during the second stage of the process.<br>
In order to facilitate the synthesis, fluoride ions<br>
can also be added, in the form of, for example, ammonium<br>
25fluoride, in F-/SiO2 ratios of less than 0.01.<br>
On completion of the crystallisation stage, the<br>
crystals of ITQ-24 are separated from the mother liquor<br>
and recovered.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the ITQ-24<br>
30material containing Al can also be prepared starting from<br>
the form containing boron using well-known post-synthesis<br>
methods  (Chen et al., Studies in Surface Science and<br>
Catalysis (2001), 135, 1710-1717), such as for example<br>
the exchange in the aqueous phase of the material with<br>
35boron  for  a  source  of  aluminium  ions  among  which<br><br>
13<br>
preference is given to nitrate, chloride or halide in<br>
general, sulphate, carbonate, citrate, oxide and<br>
hydroxide. Also, the zeolite B-Ti-ITQ-24 can be converted<br>
into the Ti-ITQ-24 analogue by means of post-synthesis<br>
5treatments permitting the selective elimination of atoms<br>
of B from the zeolite lattice using processs similar to<br>
those described previously in the literature (Tatsumi et<br>
al., J. , Phys. Chem., B., 105, 2897 (2001) , J. Catal,<br>
202, 245 (2000) and PCT WO2003/074422).<br>
10 A third object of the present invention refers to a<br>
method for converting a feed formed from at least one<br>
organic compound consisting of placing the feed in<br>
contact with a catalytically active quantity of the<br>
crystalline material known as ITQ-24.<br>
15 An additional object of the present invention is a<br>
method for converting a feed formed from at least one<br>
organic compound consisting of placing the feed in<br>
contact with a catalytically active quantity of the<br>
crystalline material obtained in accordance with the<br>
20process described above.<br>
With the aim of preparing catalysts, the crystalline<br>
material of the present invention can also be intimately<br>
combined with hydrogenating-deoxygenating components such<br>
as  platinum,  palladium,  nickel,   rhenium,   cobalt,<br>
25tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium, manganese, iron<br>
and mixtures thereof. The introduction of these elements<br>
can be carried out in the crystallisation stage, by<br>
exchange {if appropriate), and/or by impregnation or<br>
physical mixing. These elements can be introduced in<br>
30their cationic form and/or starting from salts or other<br>
compounds which, by decomposition, generate the metallic<br>
compound or oxide in its suitable catalytic form.<br>
The  zeolite  ITQ-24  produced by  means  of  this<br>
invention can, when it contains trivalent elements in its<br>
35composition, and once pelletised, be used as a component<br><br>
14<br>
of catalysts in acid catalytic cracking processes, such<br>
as for example processes of catalytic cracking of<br>
hydrocarbons, catalytic hydro-cracking of hydrocarbons,<br>
reforming of hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatics with<br>
5olefins and in processes of esterification, acylation,<br>
aniline reaction with formaldehyde in its acid form<br>
and/or exchanged with suitable cations.<br>
Likewise, when it contains tetravalent elements in<br>
its composition, such as Ti and/or Sn, zeolite ITQ-24 can<br>
lObe used as a heterogeneous catalyst in oxidation<br>
processes of olefins with organic or inorganic peroxides<br>
in reactions of the Bayer-Villiger type or Meerwein-<br>
Pondorf type, among others.<br>

In order to illustrate the nature of the invention<br>
30and the manner of preparing and using it, the following<br>
examples are presented:<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example    1.-    Preparation   of   hexamethylene-bis<br>
35(trimethylammonium) bromide<br><br>
15<br>
37.38 g of 1,6-dibromohexane (purity = 96%) and<br>
82.35 g of trimethylamine solution (31-35% by weight in<br>
ethanol) are added to a 500 ml flask, and the necessary<br>
ethanol is immediately added for obtaining a suitable<br>
5mixture of the different products that have been added<br>
while they are homogenised by magnetic stirring. The<br>
resulting mixture is kept at room temperature with<br>
constant stirring for 48 hours, and the solid that is<br>
formed is recovered by means of filtration and is<br>
lOthoroughly washed with ethyl acetate and diethyl ether.<br>
The white solid obtained is dried at room temperature for<br>
12 hours.<br>
Example    2.-    Preparation   of   hexamethylene-bis<br>
15(trimethylammonium) dihydroxide<br>
Hexamethonium dihydroxide is prepared by direct<br>
anion exchange, using a resin, Amberlite IRN-78<br>
(Supelco), as a source of hydroxide anions, having<br>
previously washed the resin with distilled water up to pH<br>
20= 7. The process consists of dissolving 9 g of<br>
hexamethonium dibromide obtained according to example 1<br>
in 250 g of Milli Q water (Millipore) . The resulting<br>
solution is made to pass through an Amberlite IRN-78<br>
washed  resin  column,  with  the  flow  velocity being<br>
25adjusted in order to achieve an exchange level greater<br>
than 95%. The resulting solution of hexamethylene-bis<br>
(trimethylammonium)  dihydroxide  is  collected  in  a<br>
precipitates jar. This solution is concentrated at 50 °C<br>
and  vacuum  until   reaching  a   concentration   of<br>
30hexamethylene-bis(trimethylammonium)    dihydroxide   of<br>
approximately 0.5 mol/kg.<br>
Example  3.-  Synthesis  of  the  material  ITQ-24  with<br>

16<br>
of hexamethylene-bis(trimethylammonium) dihydroxide with<br>
a concentration of 0.4 99 mols/kg. In the solution<br>
obtained, 14.54 g of tetraethylorthosilicate and 0.856 g<br>
of aluminium triisopropoxide are hydrolysed, and it is<br>
5kept stirring allowing all the ethanol and isopropoxide<br>
formed in the hydrolysis to evaporate until the reaction<br>
mixture reaches a final composition:<br>

10<br>
wherein R{OH2) is of hexamethylene-bis (trimethylammonium)<br>
dihydroxide.<br>
The gel is heated at 175°C with stirring for 15 days<br>
in steel autoclaves with an internal Teflon lining. The<br>
15solid obtained after filtering, washing with distilled<br>
water and drying at 100 °C is ITQ-24 and whose list of<br>
