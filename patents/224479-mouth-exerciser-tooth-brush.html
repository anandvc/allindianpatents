4.	Patent No-4185, 817 with title Teeth Exerciser.<br>
5.	Patent No-4280696 with title Jaws and facial muscle Exerciser.<br>
Patent NO.1 is heavy and odd Patent No.2 is a simple apparatus which does not show much quality of work as promised. No.3 is only useful for thumb sucking children.<br>
Patent No 5: is a 'IT shaped yieldable material which also does not prove to be as efficient.<br>
Patent No 5: is a complicated Mouth Exerciser operated by front teeth. The draw backs of the above instruments are, they are heavy to carry with an uncomfortable shape to hold and for using. The front teeth apparatus any how does not exercise the Jaws, as well as there is a Problem of the front teeth getting Protruded. Out of the mouth resulting in loosing the shape of the mouth. Operation of most of these apparatus will also need to be done in the guidance of a Physiotherapist. Like this invention of mouth exercising tooth brushes, Even though our invention is, any how related to all above said 'Prior Arts' at the same time it is specially designed for the exercising of the jaws by keeping in between the Jaws and Chewing it with the grinding teeth only It is simple to hold, carry and operate. One can definitely remember to use it when ever one brushes because, it is fixed at the back of the tooth brush.<br><br>
Object of the invention:- Human teeth roots skull, face muscles, mouth and jaws these parts generally need good exercise in order to keep them in full working condition and health. Human teethroot, skull, face muscles and jaws need exercise as nature intends just like human body needs exercise. In ancient time man used to eat raw food. In this process, cutting, grinding and tearing works used to be done. It used to give good exercise to teethroots mouth, inside skull, face muscles and jaw bones. Because of these exercise their teeth roots, muscles of their skull face and jaw bones used to be healthy and their face used to be free of excess fat and look thin, slim and glowing with natural beauty.<br>
One hypothisis in dental medicine says, people use cooked food which will be smooth and soft. They need not chew it very hard. Therefore the jaws size of now a days people decreasing gradually from ages. Hence the wisdom teeth are growing irregularly because of no space in the jaw. That's why they will have to be removed by surgery. Another problem is because of lack of exercise in the mouth the skull muscles become week and fact accumulation will take place in the face. You may prevent this with Mouth Exerciser and also the teeth roots will obviously become stronger.<br>
Generally one does exercise daily to keep himself fit and healthy. Several equipments are available in the market to carry out this exercises. But no perfect equipment is available to carry out this exercises of the mouth, skull, face muscles and teeth roots. So this mouth Exerciser is invented. It is a tuning fork like instrument which will not be completely even in shape like fork, but it will be of 1.2cm gap approxmatly at the back between the two bars and approxmatlly 2 cm gap slightly after the middle and gradually both the bar ends get attached to the brush handle. Between the two bars, a compressable and expandable rubber piece is fixed. When it is kept in side the mouth between the teeth and pressed 20 times it gives good exercise to our skull and face muscles, jaws and teeth roots in form of chewing.<br>
The existing technology of the 'prior arte' are difficult to hold and carry, heavy and odd looking, and most of them needing the guidence of a physiotherapist for the operation Some of the above said arts may even cause the damage of the teeth losing shape by protruding outside. It has already been proposed with this mouth Exerciser tooth brush,<br><br>
teeth roots, mouth, inside skull, face muscles and jaw bones get a good exercise, at the same time removing the excess of fat also from the face.<br>
"The principal object of this invention is" to make this instrument being used by<br>
every person, i.e. children, Adults, old, of all ages at home only, with out the guidance of a<br>
phesiotherapist or a trained instructor of the gymnasium "Another object of this invention<br>
is" it is a simple instrument made of plastic and rubber attached to the back of a tooth<br>
brush, which helps to conduct the exercise every day with out forgetting, "Further object of<br>
this invention is "to give exercise to entire mouth, skull and face muscles, jawbons and<br>
teeth roots. So they become strong and healthy and the excess fat form the face will be<br>
removed. Because of which the face will be thin , slim and glow with natural beauty. A<br>
"further object of the invention" may help prevent the irregular growth of the wisdom teeth<br>
and the dislocation of the jaws which occurs usually to some in the old age. It is very easy<br>
to carry, hold and safe, to use It is used only between the grinding teeth of the jaws. So<br>
protrution of front teeth will not happen.<br>
