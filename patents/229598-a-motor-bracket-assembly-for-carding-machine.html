A MOTOR BRACKET ASSEMBLY FOR CARDING MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a textile carding machine, more particularly to a drive motor bracket assembly adapted for an easy exchange of motor pulley and to drive an endless belt with a variable tensioning arrangement. Background Art<br>
in the textile preparatory process, the use of carding machine for opening and pre parallelizing of the fibre is well known. In such carding machines the fibre material is fed to the feeding arrangement of the carding machine in the form of flocks or laps. The fibre is opened and parallelized during its passage in the wire point clothed feed rollers, licker-in, cylinder and flat zone of the carding machine. The opened fibre is gathered from the cylinder by a doffer clothed with wire points and converted as a draftable sliver during subsequent passage through the take off and web gathering devices of the carding machine. The sliver thus produced is fed to a can coiler and deposited on to a revolving can kept underneath the revolving coiler plate. The cylinder of the carding machine is normally run by independent drive motor. During starting of the carding machine, the cylinder drive motor has to overcome the high inertia due to the weight of the cylinder, which is normally in the order of 100 Kg. In majority of the carding machines, couplings like centrifugal coupling, fluid coupling are mounted on the motor shaft; to overcome the inertia. Alternatively, the cylinder can be run by motor pulleys mounted on the motor with electrical control msans provided for overcoming the inertia.<br>
In the known carding machines the coupling or the motor pulley as the case may be has to be essentially mounted on the motor shaft and the motor has to be mounted on the machine frame. The couplings or the motor pulley remains inside the machine frame in line with the pulley mounted on the cylinder to facilitate the drive by belt drive means. Tensioning means are provided to keep the belt under required tension for proper transmission of drive.<br>
In order to run the carding cylinder at different speeds couplings or the motor pulleys with different diameter being adopted. In order to change the cylinder speeds, the couplings or the motor pulley has to be exchanged. For this purpose the motor has to be dismantled from the machine. Since the motors are of higher capacity the<br><br>
dismantling and re fixing of the motor for exchanging the coupling or the motor pulley is very difficult and time consuming.<br>
The tensioning arrangement available in the known carding machine has limitation because of which belts with different endless lengths are required for the running of the cylinder at different speeds. Objects of the invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a drive motor bracket assembly adapted for an easy exchange of motor pulley and to drive an endless belt with a variable tensioning arrangement.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a drive motor bracket assembly with adjustable tension means permitting the usage of a single endless length belt for providing drive to the cylinder of the carding machine at different speeds using pulleys of different diameter. Summary of the invention<br>
A drive motor bracket assembly for mounting a motor of a carding machine adapted to drive an endless beh and to provide a variable tensioning arrangement to said belt, said device comprising a stationary hinge bracket with a pair of extending arms disposed on one side of the main frame, a hinge pin member operably disposed between the arms of said stationary hinge bracket, a locking bracket with a pair of extending arms disposed on the opposite side of the main frame in plane parallel to the stationary hinge bracket, a swiveling motor bracket member one end of which is having suitable surface-end configuration to co-operate with the hinge pin member of said hinge bracket, said stationary hinge bracket along with a pin member acting as pivot to said swiveling motor bracket member and the other end with an elongated tab having an opening, said swiveling motor bracket member acting as a housing to the motor and disposed to arch along with the motor in vertical axis of the main frame, between the stationary hinge bracket and the locking bracket, a movable clamping scud member pivoted to said locking bracket to provide locking means by firmly binding the opening of the tab portion of said swiveling motor bracket member, an alignment element in the form of setting gauge for aligning the gap between the main frame and motor bracket member during the alignment process, and a tension adjusting means disposed on the motor bracket assembly to provide a variable tension<br><br>

opening (3b), said swiveling motor bracket member (3) acting as a swiveling housing to the motor (5) and disposed to arch along with the motor (5) in vertical axis of the main frame (2), between the stationary hinge bracket (1) and the locking bracket (9), The stationary hinge bracket (1) is disposed provide a swiveling support to the motor bracket member.<br>
A movable clamping stud member (8) pivoted to said locking bracket (9) to provide locking means by firmly binding the opening (3b) of the elongated tab (3a) of said swiveling motor bracket member (3). In the opened position of the said motor bracket member (3), a motor pulley (6) is mounted on the motor shaft and rigidly connected to the said motor shaft using tension element (7). Clamping stud (8) is hinged to the locking bracket (9) through the pivot pin (10). Once the motor pulley (6) is mounted, the said motor bracket (3) with the said main motor (5) is swung towards the main frame such that the opening (3b) of the elongated tab (3a) passes through the clamping stud (8). An alignment element in the form of setting gauge (11) for aligning the gap between the main frame (2) and motor bracket member is used during the alignment process. By using the setting gauge (11) a pre-set gap is maintained between the said motor bracket (3) and the main frame (2). In this position the said motor bracket (3) is locked by the lock nuts (1242a). The endless belt (22) drivingly connects cylinder pulley (23) mounted on the axis of the cylinder and the said motor pulley (6) through the tension rollers (13,13a) for the transmission of the drive to the said cylinder.<br>
Now by referring specifically to Figures 2, 3 4&amp; 6 a tension adjusting means of the present invention is described, which enables a user to adapt a single endless length belt (22) for providing drive to the cylinder of the carding machine, at different speeds, by incorporating pulleys of different diameter. In this arrangement of the present invention, tensioning means is mounted on the upper surface of the motor bracket (3).<br>

Tension plate (14) is pivoted with the help of pin (15), which is fixed on the tensioning lever (17) at it's one end in such a manner that the said tension plate (14) carrying the said tension rollers (13,13a) can be swiveled about the axis of the said pin (15). The other end of the said tensioning lever (17) is pivoted to the motor bracket (3) through the fulcrum pin (18). The tension plate (14) is further provided with another pin (16) having a hole perpendicular to its axis. Tensioning bolt (19) with a threaded end (19a) is permitted to pass through the hole provided in the pin (16) and an eye portion (19b) at the other end through which said tensioning bolt (19) pivoted to the said tensioning lever (17) through the connecting pin (20). The adjusting nut (21) provided to adjust the position of said tension rollers (13, 13a) with reference to the axis of the said pin (15) to incorporate the pre-determined tension to the said endless belt (22). A Stopper (24) element provided on the said motor bracket (3) to limit the swinging of said tensioning lever (17). The alignment of the said endless belt (22) is adjusted by adjusting the said lock nuts (12,12a) while running the endless belt (22). Working of the invention<br>
The working of the present invention is explained by specifically referring to Figures 2-6. Whenever, during the working of the carding machine, in the event of any necessity to change the motor pulley (6), the said endless belt (22) is relieved of the tension by shifting the position of the said tension rollers (13,13a) away from the belt by loosening of the said adjusting nut (21), and if necessary, by swiveling the said tensioning lever (17). During this process, lock nut (12) is unscrewed and the motor bracket (3) is swiveled in a direction away from the said main frame (2) to about 90^. in this position, the tension element (7) is loosened and said motor pulley (6) is exchanged with the required motor pulley according to the speed by which the cylinder has to be operated. The exchanged pulley is firmly fitted to the motor shaft using the tension element. Then the said motor bracket (3) with the said main motor (5) and said motor pulley (6) is swung towards the main frame (2) such that the said opening (3b) of the said motor bracket (3) passes through said clamping stud (8) and using the said setting gauge (11), a pre-set gap is maintained between the said motor bracket (3) and the said main frame (2). In this position the said motor bracket (3) is locked by the lock nut (12).  Subsequently, the endless beh (22) is laid over the said<br><br>
motor pulley (6), the said cylinder pulley and the said tension rollers (13,13a). The pre-determined tension is applied to said endless belt (22) by adjusting the said adjusting nut (21) which swings the said tension plate (14) carrying the said tension rollers (13,13a) towards the belt.<br>
Now by referring to Figure 6, wherein the layout arrangement of the belt is described. The layout arrangement of the belt used to transmit the power from the motor pulley (6) to the main motor to the cylinder pulley (23) is mounted on the axis of the cylinder of the carding machine.
