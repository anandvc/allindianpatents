As the secondary air supplying device for a small-sized motorcycle such as a conventional scooter or the like, there are provided a system in which an air cleaner (an air cleaner for an exhaust gas system) for purifying secondary air supplied to an exhaust gas system is fixed to a vehicle body frame and further having a<br>
check valve (a reed valve) fixed to the internal combustion engine (gazettes of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos hei supply indian equivalent  5-139364, 5-131969 and 5-332132) and<br>
ther system in which an air cleaner for the exhaust gas system and a check valve are fixed to a storing box below a seat (a gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 4-47114) or the like.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the aforesaid prior art secondary air supplying device, either a secondary air supplying pipe part connecting an air cleaner for an exhaust gas system fixed to the vehicle frame with a check valve fixed to the internal combustion engine or another secondary air supplying pipe for connecting the air cleaner for the exhaust gas system fixed to a storing box and the check valve with the exhaust gas system (a connecting part of the secondary air supplying pipe) had to be formed long with its certain looseness (a bent part) being applied in such a way that the expansion or retraction caused by oscillation of the internal combustion engine unit could be absorbed. In addition, when a maintenance work for the secondary air supplying device such as the air cleaner for the exhaust gas system or the check valve was carried out, fixing or removal of the body cover was<br>
required.<br>
Further, in the case that the air cleaner for the exhaust gas system was fixed to either the body frame or the storing box, it was frequently found that the air cleaner was installed in a vacant space among the vehicle body frame, the storing box and the body cover and in this case, setting of a shape and a volume of the air cleaner for the exhaust gas system was restricted.  Then, for example, if the air cleaner for the exhaust gas system was set to have a shape with many flat planes under such a restriction as above, the planes were vibrated to generate noise, resulting in that they were disadvantage.<br>

This is similar to Fig. 15 showing an example of modification of a preferred embodiment (a preferred embodiment 9) shown in Fig. 15<br>
[Preferred Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
At first, one preferred embodiment of the invention (a preferred embodiment 1) described in Claims 1 to 3 and Claims 15 to 18 shown in Figs.l to 4 will be described as follows.<br>
In these figures, 1 denotes a scooter type motorcycle in which a secondary air supplying device is applied to an exhaust system of a preferred embodiment 1 of the present invention illustrated in a left side elevational view, and 2 denotes a seat in which a steering head 4 is raised with a low floor section 3 being spaced apart at a front part of the seat.<br>
A handle turning shaft 6 turned by a handle 5 is pivotally supported at a head pipe 7 and a front wheel<br><br>
9 is suspended at the lower end of the shaft through a front fork 8. Then, a down-frame 10 is extended from the head pipe 7 to a downward direction, branched at its lower section into a right side and a left side to extend at the floor section 3 to a rearward direction and then the<br>
down-frame is connected to a ree.r frame 11. The rear frame 11 is extended in a slant upward and rearward direction and reaches the lower part of the rear end of the seat 2.<br>
The front section of a vehicle body of which frame-work is formed by these down-frame 10 and rear frame 11 is provided with a leg shield 12 covering the rear section of the down-frame 10 and extending along this rear section, wherein the leg shield 12 is extended in a rearward and downward direction and connected to a floor cover 13 covering a central floor section of the vehicle body. Then, the floor cover 13 is connected to the body cover 14 covering the rear extended section of the rear frame 11 where it is raised from its horizontal section to the slant rear section, the body cover 14 is connected to a center cover 15 at its front upper section and the center cover 15 covers, together with the front seat 2, the front section of a fuel tank 16 stored below the seat 2.<br>
17 denotes an internal combustion engine unit (a swing unit) for use in suspending a rear wheel, wherein its front section is attached to the front lower section of the rear frame 11 through a hanger link 18 in such<br>
a way that it may be oscillated in an upward or downward direction and its rear section is suspended at the rear section of the rear frame 11 through a cushion unit 19.<br>
At the front section of the internal combustion unit 17 is integrally arranged an internal combustion engine 20 and at its rear section is pivotally arranged a rear wheel 21. Then, a power transmitting device (a belt continuously variable transmission) 22 for use in transmitting a power of the internal combustion engine 20 to the rear wheel 21 and a muffler 28 which is one element constituting an exhaust gas system to be described later are integrally arranged at the internal combustion engine unit 17 with the rear wheel 21 being held between them.<br>
The internal combustion engine 20 is a 2-cycle internal combustion engine, wherein an intake system comprised of an air cleaner 23, a carburetor 24 and an intake pipe 25 is connected to an intake port (not shown) of the internal combustion engine 20.<br>
The exhaust pipe 27 is extended from an exhaust port 26 arranged at a cylinder section of the internal combustion engine 20 in a forward and downward direction, thereafter curved and directed in a rearward direction,<br>
a main body 30 of a muffler is cooperatively connected to its rear part and the muffler 28 is constituted by these members.<br>
The exhaust pipe 27 and the main body 30 of the muffler are removably connected at a connecting part 31 in such a way that flanges of each of them are removably connected by a coupling means comprised of a bolt and a nut.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, within the main body 30 of the muffler is stored a catalyst converter 32 composed of metallic catalyst, wherein exhaust gas fed by the exhaust pipe 27 performs an oxidization reaction in the catalyst converter 32 to become complete combustion gas and the gas is discharged into the surrounding atmosphere while being purified.<br>
To the aforesaid exhaust system is fed secondary air in addition and an effect of purifying exhaust gas with the aforesaid catalyst converter 32 is improved. This secondary air is supplied from a secondary air inlet port 34 formed relatively near a section connected to the exhaust port 26 of the internal combustion engine 20 through a secondary air supplying system to be described later.<br>
The aforesaid secondary air supplying system is comprised of an air cleaner 35 for an exhaust system/ a check valve composed of a reed valve 36, and a secondary air supplying pipe 37 connecting these members and further connecting them to the aforesaid secondary air feeding inlet 34.  The secondary air supplying pipe 37 is comprised of a flexible rubber hose 38 connecting the air cleaner 35 for the exhaust system to the reed valve 36, a flexible rubber hose 39 at the side of the reed valve 36 connecting the reed valve 36 to the secondary air feeding inlet 34, and a metallic pipe 40 at the secondary air feeding inlet 34.<br>
The rubber hose 38 can be separated at connecting sections 37a, 37b and further the hose is removably arranged in respect to the reed valve 36 at a connecting part 37d with the reed valve 36.  The rubber hose 39 is also removably arranged in respect to the reed valve 36 at the connecting part 37e with the reed valve 36.  In addition, the rubber hose 3y and the metallic pipe 40 are removably arranged at a connecting part 37c placed at a substantial intermediate point between the reed valve 36 and the secondary air feeding inlet port 34.<br>
The aforesaid air cleaner 35 for the exhaust system is fixed to the rear section of a cockscomb-like vertical fixing piece 41 (refer to Fig. 4) fixed vertically at a top end of the main body 30 of the muffler with its air suction inlet 35a being directed in a forward and downward direction by some fixing means 42 composed of bolts and nuts, wherein a side of a clean chamber 35b within the air purifying chamber is divided by a partition plate 35c into two chambers, both chambers are communicated by a communicating pipe 35d, air purified by a filter 35e passes through these two chambers, exits out of an outlet port 35f and is guided to a rubber hose 38 of the secondary air supplying pipe 37.<br>
The aforesaid reed valve 36 is fixed, by connecting means 44 composed of bolts and nuts, to the two front and rear arms 43a, 43b extended out in a horizontal direction of the fixing piece 43 fixed to a forward wide section of the vertical fixing piece 41.<br>
Then, these air cleaner 35 for exhaust system and the reed valve 36 are thermally shielded by the muffler cover 45 against the main body 30 of the muffler. The aforesaid muffler cover 45 is fixed to the main body 30 of the muffler in a predetermined clearance while a slit part 45a at its top section is being fitted to a welded<br>
leg 41a of the vertical fixing piece 41.<br>
Since the preferred embodiment 1 is constructed as described above, both the air cleaner 35 and the reed valve 36 for the exhaust system are arranged to be exposed out of the body cover 14, it does not become necessary to fix or remove the body cover 14.<br>
In addition, it becomes possible to make a free setting of both shape and volume of the air cleaner 35 for the exhaust system and exhaust sound of the internal combustion engine transmitted to the air cleaner 35 for the exhaust system or vibration sound of the reed valve 36 can be effectively muffled by making its shape into a cylindrical shape or increasing its volume or dividing the clean chamber 35b in the chamber into a plurality of chambers communicated in series.<br>
Additionally, both the air cleaner 35 and the reed valve 36 for the exhaust system are oscillated together with the oscillating main body 30 of the muffler of a part of the internal combustion engine unit 17, so that it does not become necessary to form each of sections 38, 39, 40 of the secondary air supplying pipe 37 connecting the air cleaner 35, reed valve 36 for the<br>
exhaust system and the secondary air feeding inlet port 34 in such a way that it may absorb expansion or retraction caused by the internal combustion engine unit 17 and so a length of each of the sections 38, 39 and 40 and an entire length of them can be made short.<br>
Further, since both the air cleaner 35 and the reed valve 36 for the exhaust system are arranged altogether at the main body 30 of the muffler, it is possible to arrange the entire secondary air supplying device in a compact manner.<br>
In addition, since the reed valve 36 is arranged in a spaced apart relation against the internal combustion engine 20, there is no possibility that it may be thermally damaged by the engine.<br>
Further, in the case that the main body 30 of the muffler, the secondary air supplying device (the air cleaner 35 for the exhaust system and the reed valve 36) arranged at the aforesaid main body 30 of the muffler and the rear wheel 21 or the like are repaired and maintained, the main body 30 of the muffler can be removed together with the secondary air supplying device, the rear wheel 21 can be removed so as to enable their works to be easily carried out due to the fact that the main<br>
body 30 of the muffler is formed such that it may be freely fixed or removed together with the exhaust pipe 27.<br>
