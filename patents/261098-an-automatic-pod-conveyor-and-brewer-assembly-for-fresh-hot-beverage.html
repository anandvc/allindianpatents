				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to an automatic pod conveyor and brewer assembly for<br>
fresh hot beverage wherein the pod conveyor sub-assembly in conjunction with<br>
an electronic processor, automatically conveys and precisely positions a single<br>
serving pod in the brewer sub-assembly and wherein the brewer sub-assembly<br>
in conjunction with a water heating system, automatically brews freshly the<br>
brewing material contained in thus conveyed single serving pod using hot<br>
pressurized water provided by the water heating system, through the interior of<br>
an injection nozzle detachably fixed to the brewer base. Each individual serving<br>
of fresh hot beverage thus prepared has consistency in taste and flavor, which<br>
is like the hot beverage manually brewed at that instant of time. The brewing,<br>
infusible or other material that may be contained in the single serving pod<br>
include, without implying any limitation thereto, materials such as tea, coffee,<br>
material of plant origin such as floral pieces like jasmine flowers, vegetable<br>
pieces like carrots, onions, materials of animal origin such as honey or any<br>
other suitable beverage powder or material that can be used in the pod. The<br>
brewing by the assembly is fast which makes the assembly specifically, but<br>
without implying any limitation thereto, useful for use in offices, ceremonial<br>
functions, public meetings, etc where a large number of cups of hot beverage<br>
are required in a short period of time.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Automatic or semi-automatic brewing and dispensing machines are known in<br>
the art for hot beverages such as tea, coffee, soup and hot chocolate drink, etc.<br>
In these machines, the beverage material used is either in loose form or is<br>
contained in a container. Some machines use flexible containers such as filter<br>
paper bags containing roast and ground coffee or leaf tea. Some machines use<br><br>
single serving cartridges, which may be rigid, semi-rigid or flexible. The main<br>
assembly in such machines is the brewing assembly wherein the single serving<br>
cartridges are pierced by suitable means provided therein. The hot pressurized<br>
water is made to flow into the single serving cartridge which commingles with<br>
the brewing material contained in the single serving cartridge and brews the<br>
brewing material therein. The brewers have outlet for flow out of thus brewed<br>
liquid into a dispensing cup.<br>
In order to enhance the capacity of the brewers for brewing single serving<br>
cartridges, magazine tubes are known to be used which stack plurality of single<br>
serving cartridges. In such configurations, suitable conveying mechanisms are<br>
provided for conveying one single serving cartridge at a time from a magazine<br>
tube to the brewer assembly. The plurality of magazine tubes, each magazine<br>
tube having plurality of single serving cartridges with same brewing material or<br>
each magazine tube stacking single serving cartridges of different brewing<br>
material, are known. These magazine tubes are provided on a magazine plate,<br>
which is rotatable so that a single serving cartridge having desired brewing<br>
material could be positioned or selected and conveyed by the conveying means<br>
so that the brewing material may be brewed in the brewer assembly.<br>
US patent No. 6,997,103 discloses a brewing apparatus, which uses a flexible<br>
container for brewing material. The brewing material is contained in a sachet,<br>
which is sealed with a flexible plastic film on one side, filter paper on other side<br>
and has an extension on one side as an outlet for the brewed liquid. There are<br>
two clamp members, which can be moved closer to each other to enclose the<br>
sachet. One of the clamp members has an elastomeric membrane supported on<br>
a hydraulic reservoir whereas the other clamp member has a rigid wall, which is<br>
provided with a metallic injector tube projecting outwards. The two rigid<br><br>
spacing elements are provided with means to define recess around the injection<br>
tube. Upon closure of the clamps, the hydraulic pressure causes the flexible<br>
sheet to bulge outwards against the injector tube resulting in piercing of the<br>
film. The water flows into the sachet through the injector tube and the brewed<br>
liquid flows out through the extension of the sachet.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that a flap formed by a portion of the flexible<br>
film of the sachet forms a valve over the tip of the injector tube which is<br>
presumed to be sufficiently flexible that upon injection of the liquid through the<br>
injector tube outlet hole, the flap gets displaced to allow the liquid to enter the<br>
sachet and when the supply of liquid to injector tube stops, the back pressure<br>
of the sachet presses the flap against the outlet hole of the injector tube<br>
thereby preventing any of the contents of the sachet from entering and<br>
clogging the injector tube. However, the backpressure may not always be<br>
sufficient to keep the flap fully and tightly pressed against the outlet hole of<br>
injector tube with the result that the clogging of the injector tube with the<br>
contents of the sachet may occur after entry of brewing water into the sachet.<br>
Another drawback of the above brewing arrangement is that it is applicable<br>
only to flexible containers like a sachet, wherein the plastic film covering the<br>
sachet is capable of bulging out on application of hydraulic pressure from one<br>
side and being pierced by the injector tube.<br>
Still another drawback of the above brewing arrangement is that it cannot be<br>
used for sachets or cartridges formed with rigid or semi-rigid materials.<br>
Further drawback of the above brewing arrangement is that it is not suitable for<br>
automatic operation of brewing with plurality of sachets. The arrangement does<br>
not include any conveying mechanism for automatically conveying/positioning<br><br>
the sachet from a magazine tube or other such storage means for plurality of<br>
sachets to the brewing position. The above mechanism is therefore not suitable<br>
for meeting the bulk demand in a short time in offices, ceremonial functions,<br>
etc.<br>
Yet further drawback of the above brewing arrangement is that the injector<br>
tube may penetrate completely into the sachet and therefore the flexible film<br>
may not form the desired valve flap covering the injector outlet hole as<br>
assumed in the arrangement, due to imprecise positioning of the sachet in the<br>
brewing mechanism, thereby resulting in clogging of the injector tube with<br>
sachet contents during the flow out of the brewed liquid.<br>
US patent no.4,846,052 discloses a device for brewing of brewing material<br>
contained in a rigid single cartridge. The device comprises an extraction device<br>
and a single cartridge holder. The extraction device has an injection element<br>
with plurality of holes for injecting hot water into the cartridge. A cartridge is<br>
placed in the said cartridge holder beneath the extraction device so that the<br>
injection element pierces the cartridge. The hot water flows through the<br>
plurality of holes of the injection element into the brewing material contained in<br>
the cartridge. The brewed liquid flows out through the filter paper sealing the<br>
cartridge and through an outlet of the cartridge holder.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that piercing and water injection is made<br>
from one side of the cartridge and the brewed liquid flows out from other side.<br>
There may not be uniform wetting of the brewing material contained in the<br>
cartridge due to the formation of channels within the brewing material and as<br>
such there may not be thorough brewing of the brewing material contained in<br>
the cartridge.<br><br>
Another drawback of the above machine is that it requires complex piercer<br>
structure with multiple holes. It also requires the injection element to have a<br>
precision angle of point of injection in the range of 20 to 40 degrees in order<br>
not to damage the upper dome of the cartridge.<br>
Still another drawback of the above machine is that it requires a very high<br>
pressure of 8 to 15 bars which could result in the bursting of the cartridge due<br>
to any localized imperfection or weakness during construction in its wall.<br>
Additionally the cartridge needs to have a specialized design with thicker<br>
material of the wall to withstand such high pressure which adds to the cost and<br>
complexity.<br>
Further drawback of the above machine is that it has complex mechanism for<br>
releasing the used cartridge.<br>
Still further drawback of the above machine is that the cartridges require a<br>
specialized annular edge which is firmly held within the device during extraction<br>
through cooperating means. Any misplacement of the cartridge within the<br>
device during brewing will result in deformation or bursting of the cartridge.<br>
This also necessitates a complex design of the cartridge holding means on the<br>
device.<br>
Yet further drawback of the above machine is that it depends upon the internal<br>
pressure of the brewed liquid during brewing, for the cover of the cartridge to<br>
split open along its weakening line allowing the brewed liquid to flow out. The<br>
pressure inside may get reduced due to the brewing material and filter paper or<br>
the pressure inside the pod may not always be adequate enough to split open<br>
the cover of the cartridge along the weakening line for the brewed liquid to<br>
flow out.<br><br>
Even further drawback of the above device is that it is not suitable for<br>
automatic operation as it does not have plurality of cartridges stacked in<br>
plurality of magazine tubes and does not have automatic means for positioning<br>
or conveying the cartridges within the brewing device. The device is therefore<br>
not suitable for meeting the bulk demand in a short time like in offices,<br>
ceremonial functions, etc.<br>
US Patent No. 5,325,765 discloses a beverage filter cartridge wherein the<br>
cartridge has three elements. The first element is a base with inverted<br>
truncated cone shape with bottom closed and top end open. The second<br>
element is a filter in the form of an inverted cone containing the brewing<br>
material, wherein the cone has higher tapering on sides and less height than<br>
the base so that when the filter is housed in the base with sealing engagement<br>
at their rims, it forms a chamber between the surface of filter and base so as to<br>
receive the outflow of brewed liquid out of the filter cone. Third element is a<br>
dome shaped lid of a piercable material. The three element cartridge as above<br>
is housed in a housing whose upper part has a penetrator needle to puncture<br>
the lid and allow the hot pressurized water to flow into the filter cone through a<br>
hole in the penetrator needle and the lower part of the housing has a second<br>
penetrator needle for flow out of the brewed liquid.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that it requires multiple piercing means, one<br>
to puncture the filter cone lid for allowing the brewing water to flow into the<br>
brewing material contained in the filter cone and other to pierce the bottom of<br>
the housing to allow the flow out of the brewed liquid into a dispensing cup.<br>
Another drawback of the above device is that it requires specialized cartridges<br>
of a complex design which would require specialized machinery to produce.<br><br>
Yet another drawback of the device is that the piercing means have to puncture<br>
the base of the beverage filter cartridge which is made up of material such as<br>
polystyrene, polyethylene, etc, which could blunt the tip of the piercing means<br>
over a period of time, reducing the efficacy of the mechanism. US patent No.<br>
6,606,938 discloses a single serve brewer, which has a housing containing a<br>
liquid storage tank. A shaft extending vertically upwards from the liquid tank<br>
has a conical shaped baffle at its lower end and a pivotal arm at its upper end,<br>
which extends to the brewing chamber designed to accept a single serve<br>
beverage filter cartridge. An air pump on a platform is connected to a bladder<br>
and also to a port on the conical baffle via a first flexible hose. A tube<br>
extending to tank through the baffle is connected via second flexible hose to a<br>
first tubular probe carried by the said arm. A helical spring and a second tubular<br>
probe are provided under the brewing chamber.<br>
When the bladder is inflated, it pushes down the pivotal arm and shaft resulting<br>
in compressing the spring under the cartridge leading to pressing down and<br>
piercing of the bottom of the cartridge by second tubular probe. When the<br>
pressure releases, the lid of the container is pierced by the first tubular probe.<br>
The compressed air is then fed into the liquid tank via first flexible hose causing<br>
a metered amount of hot water from the liquid tank to be expelled and fed into<br>
the cartridge via second flexible hose. The beverage thus prepared passes<br>
through a filter and through the second tubular probe into the dispensing cup.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that the supply of brewing water into the<br>
single serving cartridge is by a complex and cumbersome mechanism involving<br>
air pump, bladder, two flexible hoses, a shaft, a pivotal arm etc.<br><br>
Another drawback is that it requires two tubular probes as piercing means, one<br>
tubular probe for piercing the container lid and the other tubular probe for the<br>
bottom of the cartridge.<br>
Yet another drawback is that it requires a complex mechanism to first puncture<br>
the bottom of the cartridge and then puncture the lid of the cartridge in a<br>
sequence. This sequential puncturing of the cartridge at both ends results in<br>
slower cycle time and the consumer has to wait longer for the cup of beverage.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that it is not suitable for bulk servings as the<br>
cartridges need to be manually loaded into the brewing chamber for each cup<br>
desired to be made, thereby making it unsuitable for scenarios such as offices,<br>
ceremonial functions, etc, where high speed of dispensing is required.<br>
Further drawback of the above device is that the second tubular device is used<br>
for piercing the bottom of the cartridge as well as being an outlet for the<br>
brewed liquid. This tubular device may get clogged with the brewing material<br>
during the flow out of the brewed liquid.<br>
US patent No. 6079315 discloses a beverage filter cartridge holder, which is<br>
mounted on a slidable drawer. The system includes an axially moveable lid,<br>
which is manipulated by a linkage yoke driven by an electric motor. When the<br>
lid moves axially downwards, it causes a downwardly projecting apertured<br>
probe to pierce the top of the cartridge to provide an inlet for hot water for<br>
brewing. It also causes another hollow piercing member to pierce the bottom<br>
surface of the cartridge to provide an exit flow path for the brewed liquid.<br>
A drawback of the above system is that the brewer requires a very complex<br>
internal mechanism to receive the cartridges, position it in perfect alignment<br><br>
and effect the puncturing of the cartridge from top and bottom during the<br>
brewing process, and ejection of the used cartridge.<br>
Another drawback of the above system is that the cartridge has to be manually<br>
loaded within the beverage filter cartridge holder by opening the slidable<br>
drawer, which makes the system time consuming to brew a cup of beverage.<br>
Yet another drawback of the above system is not suitable for bulk servings as<br>
there is no mechanism for automatic conveying of single serving cartridge in<br>
the cartridge holder from a cartridge storage means for plurality of cartridges.<br>
Yet another drawback of the above system is that the lid of the brewing<br>
chamber is operated using a complex pinion driven rack, electric motor, vertical<br>
tracks, etc. Additionally, the pivotal mounting of the brewing chamber on<br>
slidable drawer is of a very complex design and may get misaligned due to<br>
repeated and frequent use, in turn causing misalignment of the beverage filter<br>
cartridge.<br>
Further drawback of the above system is that it requires multiple piercing<br>
means, one for piercing top for inflow of hot water for brewing and another for<br>
piercing the bottom surface of the cartridge for outflow of the brewed liquid.<br>
This adds to the complexity of the brewer design and manufacturing cost.<br>
US patent no. 7,328,651 discloses four embodiments of a cartridge and a<br>
beverage preparation machine. The cartridge comprises an outer member, an<br>
inner member and a laminate. The interior of the cartridge is filled with one or<br>
more beverage ingredients. In the first version of the cartridge, the outer<br>
member is a bowl shaped shell having a curved annular wall, a closed top and<br>
an open bottom, which together define a receptacle. At the center of the top,<br>
an inwardly directed cylindrical extension with stepped profile is provided. A<br><br>
manifold is formed between annular wall and a coaxial secondary wall, which<br>
run around the circumference of the annular wall. Around 20 to 40 slots are<br>
provided on the annular wall. At the periphery of the outer member, a<br>
cylindrical inlet chamber with closed upper surface is provided. This inlet<br>
chamber is in communication with the manifold at 1 to 4 slots. The inner<br>
member comprises an annular frame and a downwardly extending cylindrical<br>
funnel. A filter paper is placed on the annular frame. The annular frame has<br>
outer rim and inner hub, which are joined by equispaced radial spokes. The<br>
cylindrical funnel has an outer tube surrounding an inner discharge spout<br>
through which the prepared beverage is discharged into a cup. The four variant<br>
embodiments of cartridge disclosed in the patent differ in minor constructional<br>
changes in elements such as spout discharge, radial spokes, slots on the<br>
annular wall, provision of an air inlet, etc.<br>
The beverage preparation machine disclosed in the above patent is adapted to<br>
use the cartridges of the above type. It comprises a housing, a water tank, a<br>
water heater, a water pump, an air compressor, a control processor, a user<br>
interface and a cartridge head. The cartridge head comprises a cartridge<br>
holder, cartridge recognition means and inlet and outlet piercers. The water<br>
heater heats the water to 20 to 85 degrees Celsius. The inlet piercer is a hollow<br>
needle like tube for perforating the laminate and allows water inflow through a<br>
water conduit. The outlet piercer is an open-ended cylinder having dimensions<br>
larger than the discharge spout.<br>
A drawback of the cartridges used in the above machines is that these are quite<br>
complex to manufacture and relatively expensive.<br>
Another drawback of the above machine is that it requires four-stage discharge<br>
cycle. In the pre-wet stage, the cartridge is charged with water from the water<br><br>
storage tank by means of water pump. In the next stage of 'pause', the<br>
beverage ingredients are allowed to soak in water injected during the pre-wet<br>
stage. In the next stage of brewing/mixing, water is passed into the cartridge<br>
to produce beverage. In the last stage of 'air purge, the pressurized air is blown<br>
through the beverage preparation machine and the beverage cartridge to<br>
ensure that all the beverage is dispensed and that flow path is cleared so that<br>
is ready for dispensing another beverage. In view of above, the delivery time<br>
for beverage by the above machine is longer which is typically between 10 and<br>
120 seconds. As a result, the consumer has to wait a long time before he is<br>
able to consume his beverage.<br>
Still another drawback of the machine is that the consumer has to manually<br>
place the cartridge in the cartridge holder prior to operating the machine and<br>
then manually remove and dispose the used cartridge. This slows down the<br>
cycle time and also makes it less user-friendly. In certain scenarios an<br>
additional operator may have to be deployed to run the machine, requiring<br>
additional manpower expenses.<br>
Yet another drawback of the machine is that the operator has to precisely<br>
position the cartridge on the cartridge mount such that the handle of the<br>
cartridge is located in an irregularity on the cartridge mount. It is quite possible<br>
that the cartridge may be misaligned by an untrained operator or due to human<br>
error resulting in imperfect brewing or jamming or damage to the machine,<br>
when the cartridge holder is closed by operation of the clamping lever.<br>
Further drawback of the machine is that it has no means for stacking plurality<br>
of cartridges and automatically conveying the cartridges for brewing. Due to<br>
this, the machine is not suitable for bulk servings in short time that is necessary<br>
for meeting demand in offices, ceremonial functions, etc.<br><br>
US patent No.6,536,332 discloses a brewing assembly of an automatic coffee<br>
machine for brewing coffee powder pre-packed in a cartridge. The brewing<br>
chamber is formed by two brewing chamber portions- an upper portion and a<br>
lower portion. The bottom of the brewing chamber is provided with plurality of<br>
perforator members in the shape of inclined knife blades, which are adapted to<br>
perforate the backside of the cartridge. The upper brewing chamber portion is<br>
provided with an extension member whose shape corresponds to the outer<br>
shape of the cartridge. The upper brewing chamber portion is provided with an<br>
extension member with a central opening with such diameter that the<br>
perforating members would not injure the operating person. When the closure<br>
piston abuts against the upper portion, the perforator members penetrate the<br>
bottom of the cartridge creating longitudinal slots therein. The brewing water<br>
flows through the said central opening and through the slots thus created, into<br>
the interior of the cartridge, thereby brewing the coffee powder contained in<br>
the cartridge.<br>
A drawback of the above apparatus is that it requires bottom of the cartridge to<br>
be provided with slots of dimensions so as to accommodate knife-shaped<br>
inclined perforator members. This requires precise positioning of the cartridges<br>
so that the slots of the cartridges are in alignment with the position of the<br>
inclined arrangement of the knife-shaped perforator members.<br>
Another drawback of the above apparatus is that it is also not suitable for<br>
operation with cartridges stacked in plurality of magazine tubes, as there is no<br>
conveying mechanism for conveying a cartridge from a magazine tube to the<br>
brewer unit. The above device is also therefore not suitable for meeting the<br>
bulk demand in a short time like in offices, ceremonial functions, etc.<br><br>
US patent no. 7,013,797 discloses a capsule magazine unit comprising six<br>
cylindrical capsule magazine tubes fitted in a circular arrangement on a round<br>
base. Each capsule magazine tube has an opening for capsule removal through<br>
which the lowermost of the capsules stacked in the tube, can be pushed out.<br>
The patent mentions that use can be made of a mechanism in the espresso<br>
machine as known in the art to automatically remove the capsule from the<br>
capsule magazine tube, which is made to rotate into a removal position and<br>
convey this capsule to a brewing position. In order to avoid unintentional sliding<br>
of the lowermost capsule out of the capsule removal opening, a blocking ring is<br>
provided around the capsule magazine unit, which can be lifted up when<br>
required by lifting elements provided in the holding device, to allow the<br>
positioning of the cartridge in the brewer.<br>
The above patent admits that the conveying of the cartridge from the magazine<br>
tube to brewing position and the brewing of the brewing material contained in<br>
the cartridge is by mechanisms known in the art. Thus, the above invention<br>
relates exclusively to plurality of magazine tubes and only the known conveying<br>
means are used.<br>
US patent No. 6,820,535 reports a capsule conveying mechanism comprising a<br>
capsule-conveying driving motor with a drive mechanism equipped with a<br>
driving disc provided with a driving stud. The lowest capsule in the magazine<br>
tube is pushed out by a capsule gripper, then an actuating lever swivel<br>
mounted on a rotation bearing, conveys a single serving capsule into the<br>
brewing unit. Inside the brewing unit, a spindle mechanism causes a capsule<br>
piercer to pierce the upper surface of the single serving capsule and then the<br>
pressurized hot brewing water flows into the capsule. When pressure inside the<br>
cartridge builds up to a certain level, the membrane forming the base of the<br><br>
cartridge gets pressed against a pyramid profiled plate, thus getting pierced.<br>
The brewed liquid flows out through the pores thus created by the piercing and<br>
through the draining hole on the plate and then through an outlet of the<br>
brewing unit.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that it requires multiple piercing means, a<br>
capsule piercer for piercing one side of the capsule for entry of water at high<br>
temperature and pressure and a plate having multiple pyramid-profiled points<br>
for piercing of the membrane on the other side of the capsule for allowing the<br>
brewed liquid to flow out.<br>
Another drawback of the above device is that there is a complex mechanism for<br>
conveying of the capsule from the magazine tube to the brewing unit which<br>
involves an actuating lever, drive motor, driving disc, driving stud, capsule<br>
gripper, and the actuating lever being swivel mounted on a rotation bearing.<br>
Similarly, the brewing unit also involves complex mechanism involving spindle<br>
piston drive consisting of a drive motor, drive mechanism, drive pin engaging<br>
with an outer gear tooth system of a spindle piston, drive gear equipped with<br>
inner gear tooth system, and so on. The complexity of the machine and<br>
relatively more number of moving components may cause higher operating and<br>
maintenance costs, in addition to the machine being more expensive to<br>
manufacture.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above brewing assembly is that the outflow of<br>
the brewed liquid occurs through holes in the sealing membrane of the single<br>
serving capsule created by multiple pyramid profile plate. The miniscule<br>
particles of brewed material may flow out through these holes along with the<br>
brewed liquid thereby reducing the quality of the dispensed beverage or<br>
blocking the exit tubes that convey the brewed liquid out of the brewing unit.<br><br>
Further drawback of the above assembly is that the inflow of hot water into the<br>
capsule takes place from one side and out flow of brewed liquid occurs from<br>
other side of the capsule with the result that the brewing of the brewing<br>
material contained in the pod may not be thorough as some of the brewing<br>
material particles may not be wetted. Additionally, the arrangement of inflow of<br>
water from one side and outflow from the other side results in the design of the<br>
assembly being very complex and the brewer unit being bulky.<br>
PCT application PCT/US2005/031604 reports a pod conveying mechanism<br>
wherein a pod carousel having plurality of compartments containing pod<br>
cartridges, is rotated by a spindle motor whereby the appropriate pod cartridge<br>
is dropped into the turret aperture of a turret assembly, with the help of an<br>
escapement ratchet operating in conjunction with a solenoid. A turret motor<br>
rotates the turret plate towards an injector assembly where a drive motor<br>
lowers an injection head whereby the injection nozzle of the injector head<br>
penetrates the top seal of the cartridge. The hot pressurized from a heat<br>
exchanger flows through the injection nozzle and then through the plurality of<br>
apertures provided in the insert enclosing the top end of the pod cartridge. The<br>
pressure build up of the incoming water inside the pod cartridge causes a<br>
scored area of bottom seal of the pod to open allowing the brewed beverage to<br>
flow out through a collection funnel into the dispensing cup.<br>
A drawback of the above mechanism is that the conveying and brewing<br>
mechanism, when compared to the present invention, is relatively complex in<br>
construction. A spindle motor first rotates the carousel, an escapement ratchet<br>
then positions the pod into the aperture on a turret plate where it is pierced by<br>
the injection nozzle of the injector assembly.<br><br>
Another drawback of the above apparatus is that for piercing the foil on the top<br>
side of the capsule, there is an injector assembly, which is complex in<br>
construction, consisting of an injector head moveable in a vertical plane by a<br>
cam system driven by a motor. The cam cooperates with an idler wheel, which<br>
pushes a support plate downward whereby the injector head comes in contact<br>
with the pod cartridge. This type of design also necessitates detents and limit<br>
switches in both the pod carousel as well as turret wheel since their correct<br>
positions is critical during their rotation.<br>
Still another drawback of the above apparatus is that the pod cartridge used in<br>
the apparatus is relatively complex and therefore more complex to manufacture<br>
and relatively more expensive as compared to the pod of simple design used in<br>
the present invention. In the above apparatus, the pod cartridge has<br>
thermoplastic insert with a plurality of apertures provided at the top of the pod<br>
cartridge, the insert being further covered with a foil. The bottom of the pod<br>
cartridge is made of a filter paper or a foil with a scored area, which becomes<br>
detached when the hot pressurized water gets injected into the pod cartridge.<br>
The hot pressurized water enters into the pod cartridge through the apertures<br>
in the insert and flows out through the scored area. The complexity of the said<br>
pod cartridge and its higher cost result in the increase in the final cost per cup<br>
of beverage to the consumers.<br>
Further drawback in the above apparatus is that the water flows into the pod<br>
cartridge from the top and flows out through the bottom, which necessitates<br>
provision of filter paper with apertures on one side and means for allowing the<br>
flow of water from the other side.<br><br>
Another drawback of the above mechanism is that the design uses an eccentric<br>
cam to lower the support plate and the injector head. This cam activated<br>
mechanism is generally slow in operation and increases the cycle time per cup.<br>
Yet another drawback of the system is that there is a complex mechanism for<br>
lifting the pod cartridge from the turret aperture prior to it being pushed into<br>
the disposal bin by the sweeping arm.<br>

of time and at that location.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod-<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein the brewer sub-<br>
assembly is substantially airtight during brewing which prevents the escape of<br><br>
the volatile chemicals which contribute to the aroma, flavor and taste of the<br>

such as honey or any other suitable beverage powder or material that can be<br>
contained in the single serving pod of the present invention.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod conveyor<br>

pod can be used whose external contour conforms to the internal contour of<br>
the chute where the pods are stacked and also whose external contour<br>
conforms to the inward contour at the forward end of the pod conveyor, so that<br>
it may be securely conveyed by the pod conveyor and precisely positioned in<br>
the brewer sub-assembly. Thus, the assembly design has inherent means to<br>
limit the use to pods of specific design and dimensions, thereby preventing use<br>
of inferior/spurious single serving pods.<br><br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage, wherein a combination<br>
of special design of the pod, the optimized temperature and pressure, as well<br>
as the rate of flow of hot pressurized water into the pod, enable brewing with<br>
high speed, without compromising on the quality of the hot beverage. This<br>
makes the assembly specifically suitable for brewing large number of cups in a<br>
short period, which is particularly required in places like offices, commercial<br>
establishments, ceremonial functions, etc.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein a uniquely<br>
designed pod conveyor, by its clock-wise and anti-clockwise rotational<br>

forward end. The multiple functions include conveying the single serving pod<br>
from a chute to the brewer sub-assembly without the help of any guide<br>
channel, precisely positioning the pod on a filter disc in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly and then disposing off the used pod into a disposal bin. The pod-<br>
conveyor, therefore, simplifies mechanical design and operations.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein just one means<br>
namely injection nozzle performs the multiple functions of puncturing the<br>
porous membrane of the single serving pod as well as injecting of hot<br>
pressurized water for brewing into the pod. This simplifies the complexity of the<br>
brewer design.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein the injection<br><br>
nozzle penetrates up to the top end of the pod kept in inverted position causing<br>
the injected hot pressurized water to splash back from the top end of the pod,<br>
thereby resulting in the uniform spreading of hot pressurized water inside the<br>
pod and brewing every minute particle of the brewing material contained in the<br>
pod.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod-<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein the need for<br>
multiple piercing means, one for piercing top surface of the cartridge for entry<br>
of brewing water and other for piercing the bottom for flow out of brewed<br>
liquid, is obviated, as is known in the art.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage which uses low cost<br>
single serving pods of simple structure as compared to some of the costly pods<br>
of complex structure known in the art (which incorporate puncturing or<br>
injecting means) and therefore the single serving pods of the present invention<br>
are easy to manufacture and are cost-effective thereby making the cost per cup<br>
viable for the consumers in the developing markets.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage, which is hygienic, since<br>
the assembly does not require any human intervention during the entire<br>
brewing process and the assembly also incorporates an automatic disposal<br>
mechanism, which ensures spillage-free disposal of the used pods into the<br>
disposal bin, after the completion of brewing.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage which uses static chutes<br><br>
of simple design, containing stack of inverted single serving pods, thereby<br>

serving pod, both of which together prevent miniscule particles of brewing<br>
material from flowing along with the brewed liquid into the dispensing cup<br>
thereby ensuring superior quality of the dispensed hot beverage.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage, wherein a sensor placed<br>
below the first chute, detects and sends signal to an electronic processor when<br>
that chute is empty, which in turn triggers the pod conveyor to move backward<br>
behind second chute and convey pods from this chute, placed adjacent to the<br>
first chute, on the same chute supporting plate. Similarly a sensor placed<br>
beneath the second chute detects whether that chute is empty. If so, it sends a<br>
signal to the electronic processor which in turn causes pod-conveyor to move to<br>
rest/start position behind first chute; causes halting till refill of chutes with<br>
pods, of the brewing process in the brewer sub-assembly and simultaneously<br>
sends signal to electronic display panel (not shown) providing message to the<br>
operator to refill fresh stock of the pods in the chutes. This enables the<br>
operation of the assembly with higher number of single serving pods stacked in<br>
plurality of chutes, which is necessary for meeting bulk demands in short time.<br>
This also eliminates the need for separate motor and associated mechanism for<br><br>
rotation and alignment of the base plate on which pod chutes are fitted, as is<br>
known in the art.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic pod<br>
conveyor and brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage wherein a novel<br>
mechanism of pneumatic cylinder operated using compressed air from a<br>

into the brewer chamber during the brewing process, resulting in significant<br>
reduction in cycle time per brew as compared to conventional methods like a<br>
cam type plunging mechanism.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention would be apparent from<br>
the understanding of detailed description of the invention that follows.<br>

sub-assembly (100) till refill of empty chutes (280, 290) with fresh<br>
pods (160), and also sending signal to the electronic display panel<br>
(not shown) providing message to the operator to refill the empty<br>
chutes (280, 290) with fresh pods (160); and<br>
-	limit switches (340, 350, 360, 370, 380) which when activated<br>

(c) an electronic processor (300) connected to pusher motor (250), and<br>
air solenoid valve (165);<br>
(d)	a single serving pod (160) comprising a receptacle (510) containing<br>
brewing material (520) up to 20 grams covered and sealed with a food<br>
grade porous membrane (530); and<br>
(e)	an air compressor (175) pumping compressed air to compressed air<br>
storage tank (170) which is connected to air solenoid valve (165) by<br>
connecting tube (167) and the said air solenoid valve (165) is further<br>
connected to pneumatic cylinder (110) by connecting tube (166) and<br>
wherein the brewer plunger (130) fitted to the piston rod (120) of the<br><br>
pneumatic cylinder (110) is operable up and down in the brewer<br>
chamber (150) by means of compressed air.<br>
The brewer sub-assembly of the present invention has a novel construction<br>
involving the use of a pneumatic cylinder mounted on a supporting plate with a<br>
brewer plunger fitted to the piston rod of the pneumatic cylinder, from<br>
underneath the supporting plate through an aligned circular aperture. The<br>
pneumatic cylinder is operated by compressed air generated by an air<br>
compressor and stored in a compressed air storage tank. The compressed air<br>
operates the pneumatic cylinder, which causes upward and downward<br>
movement of the brewer plunger within a short cycle time. The downward<br>
movement of the brewer plunger results in the downward movement of the<br>
single serving pod placed directly below the brewer plunger and over the filter<br>
disc holding plate, thereby positioning the single serving pod within the brewer<br>
chamber for brewing. During the upward movement of the brewer plunger,<br>
after completion of brewing, the used single serving pod is left on the filter disc<br>
holding plate, and the used pod is pushed by the pod-conveyor into a disposal<br>
bin kept alongside the brewer sub-assembly. The brewer sub-assembly does<br>
not use any conventional methods such as a motor or cam-type plunging<br>
mechanism for its operation.<br>
There is also a simplified mechanism for flow of hot pressurized water into the<br>
single serving pod for the purposes of brewing. A single means of an injection<br>
nozzle with a conical tip is detachably fixed to the brewer base with the said<br>
conical tip protruding upwards, into the brewer chamber, from the brewer base.<br>
During the downward movement of the brewer plunger, the single serving pod<br>
kept over filter disc holding plate with its porous membrane facing downward,<br><br>
presses against the conical tip of the injection nozzle whereupon porous<br>
membrane of the pod gets pierced and then hot pressurized water flowing<br>
through the interior of the injection nozzle gets injected into the interior of the<br>
pod containing the brewing material for the purposes of brewing. Thus, the<br>
single means of injection nozzle performs the multiple functions of piercing the<br>
porous membrane of the single serving pod as well as injecting hot pressurized<br>
water into the interior of the pod, as against known art which employs multiple<br>
piercing means, with one piercing means for entry of hot pressurized water into<br>
the pod from one side of the pod and then other piercing means for allowing<br>
the brewed liquid to flow out from other side of the pod. The injection nozzle<br>
penetrates right up to the top end of the single serving pod and further, the<br>
entry and flow-out of water being only from one side of the single serving pod,<br>
enables the uniform spreading of hot pressurized water inside the single serving<br>
pod thereby brewing every minute particle of the brewing material contained<br>
within the single serving pod.<br>
The brewer sub-assembly used in the present invention is substantially airtight<br>
during brewing which prevents the escape of aroma and other volatile<br>
chemicals during brewing. Such chemicals thus remain dissolved in the brewed<br>
liquid and further add to the flavor, taste and aroma of the dispensed hot<br>
beverage.<br>
The assembly ensures hygiene by having fully automatic operations with no<br>
human intervention and automatic disposal of used pods into the disposal bin<br>
The pod conveyor used in the assembly is also novel in construction and is<br>
capable of performing the multiple functions including conveying of the single<br>
serving pod from the chute to the brewer sub-assembly without having any<br><br>
guide channel, precisely positioning the pod on the filter disc in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly and disposing off the used pod into the disposal bin, in conjunction<br>
with an electronic processor and the brewer sub-assembly. The pod conveyor,<br>
with the help of pusher motor with its motor gear engaged with the pusher<br>
gear fixed onto the integral shaft of the pod conveyor, is capable of rotation in<br>
anti-clockwise and clockwise direction. During anti-clockwise rotation, the<br>
inward contour at the forward end of the pod conveyor aligns with the external<br>
contour of the pod, firmly holds the pod within said inward contour, conveys<br>
and precisely positions the pod on the filter disc in the brewer sub-assembly<br>
and returns by clockwise rotation to a position between brewer sub-assembly<br>
and the first chute, till the brewing is completed. During the next anti-clockwise<br>
rotation, the pod conveyor disposes off the used pod into the disposal bin and<br>
then returns back to its rest/start position behind the first chute if it is not<br>
empty, or else behind the second chute.<br>
The assembly includes a sensor placed below the first chute closer to the<br>
brewer sub-assembly. The sensor detects the availability of single serving pods<br>
in this chute. When it detects that this chute is empty, it gives signal to the<br>
electronic processor, which causes the pod conveyor to move behind the<br>
second chute and convey pods from this chute to the brewer sub-assembly. A<br>
sensor placed beneath the second chute senses when this chute is empty. If so,<br>
it sends a signal to the electronic processor which in turn causes the pod<br>
conveyor to move to rest/start position behind first chute, causes halting of the<br>
brewing process in the brewer sub-assembly till refill of the empty chutes with<br>
fresh pods and simultaneously sending a signal to the operator on the<br>
electronic display panel (not shown) providing message to the operator to refill<br>
the empty chutes with fresh pods. The presence of these sensors thus<br>
enhances the capability of the assembly to operate with a higher stock of pods<br><br>
stacked in plurality of chutes. This also eliminates the need for separate motor<br>
and associated mechanism for rotation of the base plate on which pod chutes<br>
are fitted, as is known in the art.<br>
A non-corrosive and food grade filter disc with fine pores of up to 250 microns<br>
each, together with the porous membrane used to cover and seal the brewing<br>
material contained in the pods, prevent miniscule particles of the brewing<br>
material to flow out along with the brewed liquid during the brewing process,<br>
into the dispensing cup, thereby ensuring fine quality of brewed liquid.<br>
The assembly uses minimum mechanical components and simplifies design. It<br>
has therefore enhanced reliability, it is easy and economical to manufacture and<br>
has relatively lower operating and maintenance costs. Its capability to brew<br>
within a short time each individual serving of brewed beverage with consistency<br>
in quality and flavor, makes it specifically useful for meeting bulk demand in<br>
short time in offices, ceremonial functions, public meetings, etc. The single<br>
serving pods used in the assembly have simple structure with no mechanism<br>
whatsoever embodied in the interior of the pods as is known in the art, thereby<br>
making the single serving pods easy to manufacture at low cost, thus making<br>
the cost per dispensed cup also low. The assembly is capable of brewing a wide<br>
variety of brewing/infusible materials that can be placed in these pods. The<br>
brewing, infusible or other material that may be contained in the single serving<br>
pod include, without implying any limitation thereto, materials such as tea,<br>
coffee, material of plant origin such as floral pieces like jasmine flowers,<br>
vegetable pieces like carrots, onions, materials of animal origin such as honey<br>
or any other suitable beverage powder or material that can be used in the pod.<br><br>

Description of Invention w.r.t. Drawings<br>
According to this invention there is provided an automatic pod conveyor and<br>
brewer assembly for fresh hot beverage which, in conjunction with an electronic<br>
processor, automatically conveys a single serving pod from a chute to brewer<br>
sub-assembly where the brewing material contained in the pod is brewed, in a<br>
time-efficient manner, by incoming hot pressurized water from a water heating<br>
assembly (not shown). The pod conveyor sub-assembly of the present<br>
invention and the brewer sub-assembly of the present invention have novel and<br>
simplified design with relatively less number of mechanical and moving<br>
components as compared to the conveyors and brewer assemblies known in<br>
the art. The brewing operation in the brewer sub-assembly is performed by a<br>
mechanism involving a pneumatic cylinder, which in conjunction, with an<br>
electronic processor and an air compressor, operates a brewer plunger which<br>
presses down the pod into the brewer chamber within a very short time,<br>
reducing the cycle time required per brew, thus making the assembly<br>
specifically useful for meeting bulk demand within short time in places such as<br>
offices, commercial establishments, etc.<br>
Referring to Fig.1, the automatic pod conveyor and brewer assembly of the<br>
present invention comprises of a brewer sub-assembly (100), a pod conveyor<br>
sub-assembly (200) and an electronic processor (300).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the brewer sub-assembly (100) includes a pneumatic<br>
cylinder (110) with piston rod (120) mounted on a supporting plate (115) with<br>
the said piston rod (120) being fitted through a dimensionally aligned circular<br><br>
aperture (125) on the said supporting plate (115). A brewer plunger (130) is<br>
fitted to the piston rod (120) of the said pneumatic cylinder (110) from<br>
underneath the said supporting plate (115). A perforated non-corrosive food<br>
grade metallic filter disc (135) is placed over a filter disc holding plate (140),<br>
which rests on three springs (148) placed between the filter disc holding plate<br>
(140) and the brewer chamber (150). The said filter disc (135) has fine pores of<br>
up to 250 microns each, which together with the porous membrane (530) (Fig.<br>
5ab, 5b, 5c) covering the single serving pod (160), prevents the miniscule<br>
particles of brewing material (520) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c) from flowing along with the<br>
brewed beverage into the dispensing cup (not shown). The filter disc holding<br>
plate (140) is placed through a dimensionally aligned aperture (149) in the base<br>
plate (220).<br>
The brewer chamber (150) is fixed underneath the base plate (220) with its top<br>
open end aligned to the circular aperture (149) in the base plate (220) and also<br>
in alignment with the brewer plunger (130) and filter disc holding plate (140) so<br>
that during the upward and downward motion of the piston rod (120) imparted<br>
to it by the pneumatic cylinder (110), the brewer plunger (130) along with filter<br>
disc holding plate (140) with single serving pod (160) placed over it, is capable<br>
of moving to and fro into the body of the brewer chamber (150) in a smooth,<br>
tight-fitting and uninterrupted manner. A brewer base (195) is detachably fixed<br>
to the bottom of the brewer chamber (150) by appropriate fixing means. An<br>
injection nozzle (180) is detachably and conveniently mounted on the brewer<br>
base (195) by means of a flange. Due to this, at any point of time, the injection<br>
nozzle (180) can be easily detached for the purposes of cleaning or<br>
maintenance. A brewed liquor outlet port (190) is provided in the brewer base<br><br>
(195) for the brewed liquid to flow into a dispensing cup (not shown) via a<br>
dispensing tube (182), which is made of food grade material.<br>
The pneumatic cylinder (110) is connected to an air solenoid valve (165)<br>
through connecting tube (166). The air solenoid valve (165) is in turn<br>
connected to compressed air storage tank (170) through the connecting tube<br>
(167). An air compressor (175) compresses the air and the air thus compressed<br>
by it is stored in the said compressed air storage tank (170). The electronic<br>
processor (300) controls the opening and closing of air solenoid valve (165),<br>
which allows movement of compressed air from compressed air storage tank<br>
(170) to pneumatic cylinder (110) during the brewing process. This mechanism<br>
enables speedy operation of the pneumatic cylinder (110), which results in<br>
rapid downward movement of the brewer plunger (130) via piston rod (120)<br>
into the brewer chamber (150) during brewing process, and subsequent rapid<br>
upward movement of the brewer plunger (130) on completion of the brewing<br>
process. This design significantly reduces the brewing cycle time per brew.<br>
The said injection nozzle (180) is a hollow tube, preferably metallic and more<br>
preferably made of non-corrosive food grade material like stainless steel. The<br>
said injection nozzle (180) has a conical tip which punctures the porous<br>
membrane (530) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c) that covers and seals the contents of the<br>
pod (160), when the pod (160) is pressed against the conical tip of the injection<br>
nozzle (180) during the downward motion of brewer plunger (130) imparted to<br>
it by the piston rod (120). Once the porous membrane (530) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c) of<br>
the pod (160) is punctured, the conical tip of the injection nozzle (180) directs<br>
hot pressurized water flowing through its interior from a hot water sub-<br>
assembly (not shown) into the interior of the pod (160), thereby brewing the<br><br>
brewing material (520) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c) contained inside the pod (160). The<br>
conical tip of the injection nozzle (180) penetrates up to the top end of the pod<br>
(160) which is in the inverted position, which results in uniform spread of hot<br>
pressurized water within the interior of the pod (160), thereby resulting in<br>
brewing of every minute particle of the brewing material (520) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c)<br>
contained in the single serving pod (160). The injection nozzle (180) preferably<br>
has an outer diameter of around 4mm.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the pod conveyor sub-assembly (200) includes a pod<br>
conveyor (210), which is rotatable on an integral shaft (215) that is fixed<br>
underneath it and located around the middle portion of its front curvilinear<br>
contour. The pod conveyor (210) is rotatable on the said integral shaft (215) in<br>
clockwise and anti-clockwise direction within the space between a base plate<br>
(220) and chute supporting plate (270). The integral shaft (215) is fitted to the<br>
pusher gear (230) positioned underneath the base plate (220) through a bush<br>
(225) mounted on the base plate (220). The pusher gear (230) is engaged with<br>
the motor gear (240) of the pusher motor (250). Due to this, when the motor<br>
gear (240) is rotated by the pusher motor (250), it results in the rotation of the<br>
pusher gear (230) in the opposite direction. When this happens, it also results<br>
in rotation of the pod conveyor (210) in the same direction as the pusher gear<br>
(230).<br>
The single serving pods (160) containing the brewing material (520) (Fig. 5a,<br>
5b, 5c) are stacked in an inverted position in the plurality of vertical chutes like<br>
chute (280) and chute (290), which are vertical hollow tubes fitted over the<br>
upper surface of a chute supporting plate (270). The chutes (280, 290) extend<br>
vertically upwards from the dimensionally aligned apertures (275, 276) provided<br><br>
on the chute supporting plate (270). The apertures (275, 276) conform in<br>
dimension and shape to the internal dimension and shape of the chutes (280,<br>
290). Chutes (280, 290) have one or more vertical slots (310, 320) extending<br>
from top to the bottom, to facilitate loading and stacking of the pods (160)<br>
therein. These chutes (280, 290) are designed to hold up to 100 single serving<br>
pods (160) each, in an inverted position with porous membrane (530) (Fig.5a,<br>
5b, 5c) facing downwards. It is to be noted that the chutes (280, 290) may<br>
have different shapes conforming to the shape of pods (160), which may also<br>
vary in shape (like shown in Fig.5(a), Fig.5(b) and Fig.5(c)). For example, the<br>
chutes (280, 290) may have circular cross-section instead of square cross-<br>
section, when the pods (160) are circular in shape, instead of being square in<br>
shape. The pods (160) can smoothly move downwards through chutes (280,<br>
290) and through the aligned apertures (275, 276) from where these are<br>
conveyed and positioned by the pod conveyor (210) into the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (100).<br>
A sensor (295) is fixed on the base plate (220) and underneath the chute<br>
(280), which provides signal to the electronic processor (300) (Fig.l) when this<br>
chute (280) is empty, i.e. no pods (160) are remaining therein. When the<br>
sensor (295) senses that chute (280) is empty, the sensor (295) sends a signal<br>
to the electronic processor (300) (Fig.l), which in turn activates pusher motor<br>
(250) to cause pod conveyor (210) to rotate in a clockwise direction, which<br>
causes moving of the inward contour (330) of the pod conveyor (210) to a<br>
position behind chute (290) till it activates limit switch (340) which sends a<br>
signal to the electronic processor (300) (Fig.l) to stop further rotational<br>
movement of the pod conveyor (210), by de-activating the pusher motor (250).<br><br>
A sensor (296) is fixed below the base plate (220) and underneath the chute<br>
(290), which provides signal to the electronic processor (300) (Fig.l) when this<br>
chute (290) is empty, i.e. no pods (160) are remaining therein. When the<br>
sensor (296) senses that chute (290) is empty, the sensor (296) sends a signal<br>
to the electronic processor (300) (Fig.l), which in turn activates pusher motor<br>
(250) to cause pod-conveyor (210) to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction. This<br>
results in rotational movement of the inward contour (330) of the pod-conveyor<br>
(210) to a position behind chute (280) till it activates limit switch (380), which<br>
sends a signal to electronic processor (300) (Fig.l), which in turn stops further<br>
rotational movement of pod conveyor (210) by switching off the power supply<br>
to the pusher motor (250). Simultaneously, the electronic processor (300)<br>
(Fig.l) also halts (till refill of the empty chutes (280, 290) with fresh pods<br>
(160)) the brewing process in the brewer sub-assembly (100) by switching off<br>
power supply to the air solenoid valve (165) (Fig.l). It also sends a signal to<br>
electronic display panel (not shown) to provide message to the operator to refill<br>
the empty chutes (280, 290) with fresh pods (160). Thus sensor (296) prevents<br>
brewing within the assembly when chute (280) and chute (290) are both<br>
empty. The sensors (295, 296) increase the capability of the assembly to<br>
operate with larger number of pods (160) stacked in plurality of static chutes<br>
like (280, 290) to meet bulk demand in short time.<br>
It is to be noted that though drawings show an embodiment of the present<br>
invention having two chutes (280, 290) fitted to the chute supporting plate<br>
(270) over the dimensionally aligned apertures (275, 276), more such chutes<br>
(280, 290) conforming to the shape of pods (160), can be provided and fitted<br>
to the chute supporting plate (270) by suitably modifying the chute supporting<br>
plate (270), pod conveyer (210) and the associated components.<br><br>
A pusher motor (250) is mounted on a motor plate (260) by suitable fixing<br>
means and the motor plate (260) is fixed underneath to the base plate (220) by<br>
fixing means such as four bolts (251, 251, 251, 251). The pod conveyor (210)<br>
has a curvilinear contour, which is such that it is capable of uninterrupted<br>
rotation in a horizontal plane in clock-wise or anti-clockwise direction within the<br>
space between the base plate (220) and the chute supporting plate (270). The<br>
forward end of the pod conveyor (210) has an inward contour (330), which<br>
aligns with the external contour of the pod (160). Due to this, when this<br>
forward end of the pod conveyor (210) comes in contact with the pod (160)<br>
during anti-clock wise rotation, it aligns with the pod (160) firmly within its<br>
inward contour (330), conveys the pod (160) from the chute (280 or 290) to<br>
the brewer sub-assembly (100), without any guide channel. The pod conveyor<br>
(210) then precisely positions the pod (160) over the filter disc (135) placed on<br>
the filter disc holding plate (140) in the brewer sub-assembly (100). The precise<br>
positioning of the pod (160) in the brewer sub-assembly (100) is enabled by<br>
the limit switch (350) as hereinafter described.<br>
The pod conveyor sub-assembly (200) includes different limit switches (340,<br>
350, 360, 370, 380), which when activated, stop the clockwise or anti-clockwise<br>
rotational movement of the pod-conveyor (210) at specific positions by giving<br>
signal to electronic processor (300) (Fig.1) which in turn switches off the power<br>
supply to the pusher motor (250). The limit switch (350) enables to stop the<br>
further anti-clockwise rotation of the pod conveyor (210) after precise<br>
positioning of the pod (160) over the filter disc (135) in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (100), as shown in Fig. 4(b). The limit switch (360) enables to stop<br>
the clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (210) at a position between the<br>
chute (280) and the brewer sub-assembly (100) till the brewing of the brewing<br><br>
material (520) (Fig. 5a, 5b, 5c) contained in the pod (160), is completed as<br>
shown in Fig. 4 (c). The limit switch (370) enables to stop the second anti-<br>
clockwise rotation of the pod conveyor (210) after the used pod (160) has been<br>
disposed of by the pod conveyor (210) (as shown in Fig. 4(d)) to a disposal bin<br>
(196) placed by the side of the brewer sub-assembly (100). The limit switch<br>
(380) enables to stop the second clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (210)<br>
when the inward contour (330) of the pod-conveyor (210) reaches behind<br>
chute (280) (as shown in Fig. 4(a)). The limit switch (340) enables to stop the<br>
clockwise rotation of the pod conveyor (210) at a position behind chute (290)<br>
when chute (280) is sensed to be empty by the sensor (295). The limit switch<br>
(380) enables to stop the anti-clockwise rotation of the pod conveyor (210)<br>
after it reaches back to its rest/start position behind chute (280) (as shown in<br>
Fig. 4(a)), when chute (290) is also sensed to be empty by the sensor (296).<br>
Referring to Fig. 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), the pod (160) is a receptacle (510) made up<br>
of substantially rigid food grade material, containing the brewing material (520)<br>
and the open side of the receptacle (510) being covered and sealed with a food<br>
grade porous membrane (530) like filter paper. The sealing of the brewing<br>
material (520) contained in pod (160) by a food grade porous membrane (530)<br>
keeps the brewing material (520) inside the pod (160) in a hygienic manner.<br>
The brewing material (520) in the pod (160) is of predetermined quantity, up to<br>
20 grams, preferably in the range of 0.1 to 12 grams, depending upon the<br>
nature of the brewing material (520).<br>
It is to be noted that the pod (160) may have various embodiments as shown<br>
in Fig. 5(a), Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 5(c). The contents of the pod (160) may be<br>
sealed by any porous membrane (530) which could be punctured by the conical<br>
tip of the injection nozzle (180) (Fig. 2) when pod (160) is pressed against it<br><br>
during the downward motion of the brewer plunger (130) (Fig.2) imparted to it<br>
by piston rod (120) (Fig. 2). The chutes (280, 290) (Fig. 1) also need to be of<br>
the shape and dimensions conforming to the shape and dimensions of the pods<br>
(160) so that the pods (160) are stackable therein in the inverted position, with<br>
one pod (160) stacked over the other and the porous membrane (530) facing<br>
downwards<br>
Working of the Assembly<br>
To begin operation of the assembly, the operator loads pods (160) into the<br>
chutes (280, 290) with the porous membrane (530) of the pod (160) facing<br>
downward and one pod (160) stacked over the other. The vertical slot (310)<br>
provided in chute (280) and vertical slot (320) provided in chute (290) help the<br>
operator to load and stack the pods (160) in correct alignment within the<br>
chutes (280, 290). During this pod loading operation, the pod conveyor (210) is<br>
positioned at its rest or start position with its inward contour (330) behind<br>
chute (280) as shown in Fig. 4(a). During the loading of chute (280) with pods<br>
(160) the lowermost pod (160) contained therein rests on base plate (220)<br>
directly in front of and in alignment with the inward contour (330) of pod<br>
conveyor (210). During the loading of chute (290) with pods (160), the<br>
lowermost pod (160) contained therein rests over the upper surface of the pod-<br>
conveyor (210).<br>
In the operation of the assembly, the electronic processor (300) sends a signal<br>
to the sensor (295) to check for the stock of pods (160) in the chute (280). In<br>
case, chute (280) is not empty i.e. pods (160) are available in this chute (280)<br>
as per the loading process described previously, the sensor (295) sends a signal<br>
to the electronic processor (300), which in turn activates the pusher motor<br><br>
(250) which then causes the pod conveyor (210) to rotate in an anti-clockwise<br>
direction till the pod (160) is conveyed from the chute (280) and is precisely<br>
positioned over filter disc (135) as shown in Fig. 4(b). At this precise instant,<br>
limit switch (350) gets activated and sends a signal to the electronic processor<br>
(300) which in turn switches off the power supply to the pusher motor (250),<br>
thereby stopping further anti-clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (210).<br>
Then the electronic processor (300) gives signal to pusher motor (250) which<br>
activates clockwise rotation of the pod conveyor (210) so as to move the pod<br>
conveyor (210) away from brewer plunger (130) prior to when the brewer<br>
plunger (130) comes down into the brewer chamber (150) for brewing. The<br>
limit switch (360) is activated when the inward contour (330) of the pod-<br>
conveyor (210) reaches a position between chute (280) and the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (100) as shown in Fig.4(c), which then sends a signal to the<br>
electronic processor (300) which in turn switches off the power supply to the<br>
pusher motor (250), thereby stopping this clockwise rotation of the pod-<br>
conveyor (210).<br>
On the other hand, if the sensor (295) returns 'no stock' signal to the electronic<br>
processor (300), the electronic processor (300) sends a signal to activate the<br>
pusher motor (250), which in turn rotates the pod conveyor (210) in a clock-<br>
wise direction till the inward contour (330) of the pod conveyor (210) reaches a<br>
position behind chute (290). At this position of the pod conveyor (210), the<br>
limit switch (340) is activated which sends a signal to the electronic processor<br>
(300), which in turn stops the pusher motor (250), thereby stopping the pod-<br>
conveyor (210) at this position. When this happens, and if pod (160) is<br>
available within chute (290), the pod (160) contained within chute (290) which<br>
was hitherto held in position within chute (290) resting over the upper surface<br><br>
of the pod conveyor (210), drops onto the base plate (220) directly in front of<br>
and in alignment with the inward contour (330) of pod conveyor (210). At this<br>
position of pod conveyor (210), the electronic processor (300) sends a signal to<br>
sensor (296) to check for stock of pods (160) in chute (290). If sensor (296)<br>
senses presence of pods (160) in chute (290), with the lowermost pod (160) in<br>
the said chute (290) resting over the base plate (220) directly in front of and in<br>
alignment with the inward contour (330) of pod conveyor (210), sensor (296)<br>
sends a signal to the electronic processor (300) which activates the pusher<br>
motor (250), which in turn rotates the pod conveyor (210) in an anti-clockwise<br>
direction till pod (160) is conveyed from its position beneath the chute (290)<br>
and is precisely positioned over the filter disc (135) in the brewer sub-assembly<br>
(100), as shown in Fig. 4(b). At this position, limit switch (350) sends a signal<br>
to the electronic processor (300), which in turn stops further rotational<br>
movement of the pod-conveyor (210). Then the electronic processor (300)<br>
gives signal to pusher motor (250) which activates clockwise rotation of the pod<br>
conveyor (210) so as to move the pod conveyor (210) away from brewer<br>
plunger (130) prior to when the brewer plunger (130) comes down into the<br>
brewer chamber (150) for brewing. When the inward contour (330) of the pod<br>
conveyor (210) reaches a position between chute (280) and the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (100) as shown in Fig.4 (c), the limit switch (360) sends a signal to<br>
the electronic processor (300) which in turn switches off the power supply to<br>
the pusher motor (250) thereby stopping further clockwise rotation of the pod<br>
conveyor (210).<br>
If the sensor (296) senses that chute (290) is empty, the sensor (296) sends a<br>
signal to the electronic processor (300), which in turn activates the pusher<br>
motor (250) to cause pod-conveyor (210) to rotate in an anti-clockwise<br><br>
direction. This results in rotational movement of the inward contour (330) of<br>
the pod-conveyor (210) to a position behind chute (280), as shown in Fig. 4(a)<br>
till it activates limit switch (380), which sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (300) which in turn stops further rotational movement of pod<br>
conveyor (210). Simultaneously, the electronic processor (300) also halts the<br>
brewing process in the brewer sub-assembly (100) till refill of the empty chutes<br>
(280, 290) with fresh pods (160) by the operator, by switching off power supply<br>
to the air solenoid valve (165) and also sends a signal to the electronic display<br>
panel (not shown) providing message to the operator to refill chutes (280, 290)<br>
with pods (160). Thus sensor (296) prevents brewing within the assembly when<br>
chute (280) and chute (290) are both empty.<br>
On automatic conveying of the pod (160) from either of the chutes (280, 290)<br>
and after positioning of the pod (160) over the filter disc (135) within the<br>
brewer sub-assembly (100), the electronic processor (300) then signals to<br>
activate the air solenoid valve (165). This allows the compressed air from the<br>
compressed air storage tank (170) to pass through the connecting tube (167)<br>
and also through the connecting tube (166) into the pneumatic cylinder (110).<br>
The compressed air, which thus enters into the pneumatic cylinder (110),<br>
pushes the piston rod (120) downwards, which in turn moves the brewer<br>
plunger (130) down into the brewer chamber (150). The pod (160) which is<br>
directly below the brewer plunger (130) and over the filter disc holding plate<br>
(140) moves downward along with the brewer plunger (130) into the brewer<br>
chamber (150) thereby pressing the porous membrane (530) of the inverted<br>
pod (160) against the conical tip of the injection nozzle (180) resulting in the<br>
puncturing of the porous membrane (530) of the pod (160). After this the<br>
electronic processor (300) activates an outlet solenoid valve (not shown) of a<br>
water heating sub-assembly (not shown), which enables the hot pressurized<br><br>
water from the said water heating sub-assembly (not shown) to pass through a<br>
connecting tube (181) and enter the pod (160) in the brewer chamber (150)<br>
through the interior of the injection nozzle (180). The conical tip of the injection<br>
nozzle (180) penetrates right up to the top end of the inverted pod (160)<br>
thereby enabling splashing back from the top end of the pod and the uniform<br>
spreading of the hot pressurized water within the pod (160). The hot<br>
pressurized water thus injected into the pod (160) through the injection nozzle<br>
(180) brews the brewing material (520) contained in the pod (160) and the<br>
brewed liquid is filtered by the porous membrane (530) of the pod (160) and<br>
filter disc (135) and then flows into a dispensing cup (not shown) through the<br>
dispensing tube (182). After the specified time required for brewing is<br>
completed, the electronic processor (300) sends a signal to the outlet solenoid<br>
valve (not shown) to close, thereby shutting off the supply of hot pressurized<br>
water into the injection nozzle (180).<br>
After specified time required for brewing is completed, the electronic processor<br>
(300) then deactivates the air solenoid valve (165), which allows the<br>
compressed air inside the pneumatic cylinder (110) to be released, thereby<br>
moving the piston rod (120) along with the brewer plunger (130) upward.<br>
Concurrent to this upward movement of the brewer plunger (130), the filter<br>
disc holding plate (140) along with the filter disc (135) and the used pod (160)<br>
lying over the said filter disc (135), move upwards simultaneously until the filter<br>
disc holding plate (140) returns to its initial rest position, prior to the brewing<br>
process, leaving the used pod (160) on the filter disc (135). The electronic<br>
processor (300) then activates the pusher motor (250) so as to cause rotational<br>
movement of the pod conveyor (210) in an anti-clockwise direction pushing the<br>
used pod (160) from above the filter disc (135) towards the disposal bin (196)<br><br>
placed adjacent to the brewer sub-assembly (100). At the precise position of<br>
the inward contour (330) of the pod-conveyor (210) when the used pod (160)<br>
falls into the disposal bin (196) (as shown in Fig.4(d)), the limit switch (370) is<br>
activated and sends a signal to the electronic processor (300) which in turn<br>
stops further anti-clockwise rotation of pod-conveyor (210) by switching off<br>
power supply to pusher motor (250). After this, the electronic processor (300)<br>
activates the pusher motor (250) so as to cause rotational movement of the<br>
pod conveyor (210) in a clockwise direction. This clockwise rotational<br>
movement of the pod conveyor (210) is stopped by the limit switch (380) at the<br>
instant when the inward contour (330) of the pod conveyor (210), reaches its<br>
rest/start position behind the chute (280) as shown in Fig. 4(a).<br>
The automatic pod conveyor and brewing sub-assembly for fresh hot beverage<br>
of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and<br>
equivalent changes by those skilled in the art. It is to be understood that the<br>
principles, functional features of different components/sub-assemblies as taught<br>
by the present invention can be employed by those skilled in the art in<br>
numerous variant embodiments by making such adaptations, modifications and<br>
equivalent changes. Such variant embodiments are intended to be within the<br>
