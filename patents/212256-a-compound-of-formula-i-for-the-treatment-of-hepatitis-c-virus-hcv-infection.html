COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND OF FORMULA (I) FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) INFECTION""<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM   (CANADA)  LTD.,  of 2100  Cunard  Street, Laval, Quebec H7S 2G4, Canada,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
approved in the clinic lor patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life ol treated patients. Recently, interferon in combination with ribavirin has been 5      approved for patients non-responsive to I FN alone. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcomes the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
10     HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the<br>
15      case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (henceforth referred to as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both<br>
20     in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events,<br>
25 enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally<br>
encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus. In this vein,<br>
30     patent application WO 97/06804 describes the (-) enantiomer of the nucleoside<br>
analogue cytosine-1,3-oxathiolane (also known as 3TC) as active against HCV. This compound, although reported as safe in previous clinical trials against HIV and HBV, has yet to be clinically proven active against HCV and its mechanism of action aaamst the virus has yet to be reponed<br><br>
Intense efforts to discover compounds which inhibit the NS3 protease or RNA helicase of HCV have led to the following disclosures:<br>
US patent 5,633,388 describes heterocyclic-substituted carboxamides and analogues as being active against HCV. These compounds are directed against the 5     helicase activity of the NS3 protein of the virus but clinical tests have not yet been reported.<br>
A phenanthrenequinone has been reported by Chu el al (Tet. Lett., (1996), 7229-7232) to have activity against the HCV NS3 protease in vitro. No further development on this compound has been reported.<br>
10     A paper presented at the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research,<br>
Urabandai, Fukyshima, Japan (1996) (Antiviral Research, 30, 1, 1996; A23 (abstract 19)) reports thiazolidine derivatives to be inhibitory to the HCV protease.<br>
Several studies have reported compounds inhibitory to other serine proteases, such as human leukocyte elastase. One family of these compounds is reported in WO 15     95/33764 (Hoechst Marion Roussel, 1995). The peptides disclosed in that<br>
application are morpholinyJcarbonyl-benzoyl-peptide analogues that are structurally different from the peptides of the present invention.<br>
WO 98/17679 from Vertex pharmaceuticals Inc. discloses inhibitors of serine protease, particularly, Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease. These inhibitors are peptide 20     analogues based on the NS5A/5B natural substrate. AH of these peptides contain C-terminal activated carboriyf function as an essential feature. These peptides-were also reported to be active against other serine protease and are therefore not specific for HCV NS3 protease.<br>
Hoffman LaRoche has also reported hexapeptides that are proteinase inhibitors 25     useful as antiviral agents for the treatment of HCV infection. These peptides contain an aldehyde or a boronic acid at the C-terminus.<br>
Steinkuhler et al. and Ingallinella et al. have published on N terminal cleavage product inhibition (Biochemistry (1998), 37, 8899-8905 and 8906-8914). However, the peptides and peptide analogues presented do not include nor do they lead to the 30      design o1 the peptides ol the present invention.<br>
WO 98/46597 from Emory University discloses serine protease inhibitors, particularly Hepatitis C virus protease. All of the compounds disclosed are structurally different<br><br><br>
from the peptides of the present invention.<br>
WO 98/46630 from Peptide Therapeutics Ltd. discloses hepatitis C NS3 protease inhibitors. However, none of the peptides disclosed are related to the peptides of the invention.<br>
5     JP10298151 from Japan Energy Corp. discloses N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyI)-<br>
substituted serine derivatives as serine protease inhibitors, specifically as hepatitis C viral protease inhibitors. These compounds do not contain any structural similarity to the peptide analogs of the present invention.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that it provides peptides that are inhibitory ) 0     to the NS3 protease of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
A further advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that these peptides specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 300µM against other serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), or bovine 15     pancreatic chymotrypsin, or cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B).<br>

wherein C1 and C2 each represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. Notwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of formula I, the presence of these two asymmetnc centers means that the compound of formula I can exist as racemic mixtures of diastereoisomers. As illustrated in the examples hereinafter, the racemic mixtures can be prepared and thereafter separated into individual optical isomers, or these optical isomers can be prepared by chiral synthesis.<br>
Hence, the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers wherein R, at position 2 is orientated syn to the carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br><br><br>
and<br><br>
or the compound of formula I can exist as a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers 15     wherein R-, at position 2 is orientated anti to the carbonyl at position 1, represented by the radical:<br><br>
In !urn: the racemic matures can be separated into individual optical isomers<br><br><br>
A most interesting finding of this invention pertains to the spatial orientation of the P1 segment. The finding concerns the configuration of the asymmetric carbon at position 1. A preferred embodiment is one wherein asymmetric carbon at position 1 has the R configuration.<br><br>
More explicitly, when carbon 1 has the R configuration, HCV NS3 protease inhibition is further enhanced by the position of the substituent R, (e.g. alkyl or alkylene) at carbon 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. A most preferred compound is an optical isomer having the Ri substituent and the carbonyt in a syn orientation in the following ]0     absolute configuration."<br><br>
In the case where R1, is ethyl, for example, the asymmetric carbon atoms at positions 1 and 2 have the R,R configuration.<br>
15     By way of illustrating the role of the absolute configuration of the substituent on the level of potency of the compound, compound 112 (Table 1) having the absolute configuration as 1R,2R, has an IC50 of 1.6 u.M whereas the corresponding 1S.2S isomer (compound 113) has an IC50 of 27.5 u.M.

PROCESS<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention were synthesized according to the process as illustrated in scheme I (wherein CPG is a carboxyl protecting group and APG is an amino protecting group):<br><br><br><br>
Briefly, the P1, P2, P3, P4, and optionally P5 and P6 can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques. The P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 and P6 groups maybe 5     linked together in any order as long as the final compound corresponds to peptides of formula I. For example, P6 can be linked to P5 to give P5-P6 that is linked to P4-P3-P2-P1 ; or P6 linked to P5-P4-P3-P2 then linked to an appropriately Oterminal protected P1.<br>
Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the a-amino group of the N-10     terminal residue and coupling the unprotected carboxyl group of the next suitably N-protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described. This deprotection and coupling procedure is repeated until the desired sequence is obtained. This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in stepwise fashion, as depicted in Scheme I, or by condensation of fragments (two or 15     several amino acids), or combination of both processes, or by solid phase peptide synthesis according to the method originally described in Memfield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1963), 85, 2149-2154, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide<br><br><br>
fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido 5     ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method, carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding t-hydroxybenzotriazole. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.<br>
10     More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxyl of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the presence of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd rev ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993).<br>
)5     Examples of suitable coupling agents are N,/V-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of A/,A/"-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-ethyl-AT-[(3-dimethylamino)propyf]carbodiimide. A very practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available (benzotnazol-1-yloxy)tris-(dimethylaminp)phosRh6nium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole.<br>
20     Another very practical and useful coupling agent is commercially, available 2-(1H-ben20triazol-1-yl)-A/, N, N\ /V"-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate; Still another very practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-A/,A/,A/",A/"-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate.<br>
The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane« 25     acetonitrile or dimethyiformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e.g.<br>
diisopropylethylamine, AJ-methylmorpholine or A/-methylpyrrolidine, is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8  The reaction temperature usually ranges between 0°C and 50°C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 min and 24 h.<br>
30     When a solid phase synthetic approach is employed, the C-terminal carboxylic acid is attached to an insoluble carrier (usually polystyrene). These insoluble carriers contain a group that will react with the carboxylic group to form a bond that is stable to the elongation conditions but readily cleaved later. Examples of which are: chloro-<br>
0" bromomethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, and ammomethyl resin. Many of these<br><br><br>
resins are commercially available with the desired C-terminal amino acid already incorporated. Alternatively, the amino acid can be incorporated on the solid support by known methods Wang, S.-S., J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1973), 95, 1328; Atherton, E.; Shepard, R.C. "Solid-phase peptide synthesis; a practical approach" IRL Press: 5     Oxford, (1989); 131-148. In addition to the foregoing, other methods of peptide synthesis are described in Stewart and Young, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", 2n0 ed.. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL (1984); Gross, Meienhofer, Udenfnend, Eds., The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, Academic Press, New-York, (1980-1987); Bodansky et al., "The Practice of Peptide Synthesis" 10     Springer-Verlag, New-York (1984), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. The protecting groups that can be used are listed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic 15     Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The ct-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester (CPG) that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be 20     used include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl and J-butyl, 2) aralkyi esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichlorbethyl and phenacyl esters.<br>
The a-amino group of each amino acid to be coupled to the growing peptide chain 25     must be protected (APG). Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as tormyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tert-30     butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyt, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and<br>
allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such as pheny!thiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl.  The preferred a-amino protecting group is<br><br><br>
either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.<br>
The a-amino protecting group of the newly added amino acid residue is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. When the Boc group is used, the methods of 5     choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichioromethane, or HCI in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichioromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in 10     dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature (RT), usually 20-22°C.<br>
Any of the amino acids having side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-described groups. Those skilled in 15     the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. The selection of such protecting groups is important in that the group must not be removed during the deprotection and coupling of the a-amino group.<br>
20     For example, when Boc is used as the a-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting group are suitable, p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or f-butylsulfonyl moieties can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy<br>
25     containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the a-amine protection, usually /ert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, terl-30     butyl ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline. and fert-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
When W is an amide (w). P1 is coupled to an appropriate amine prior to the coupling<br><br><br>
to P2. Such amination will be readily recognized by persons skilled in the art.<br>
Once the elongation of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed. When a liquid phase synthesis is used, the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These 5     procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When a solid phase synthesis is used, the peptide is cleaved from the resin simultaneously with the removal of the protecting groups. When the Boc protection method is used in the synthesis, treatment with anhydrous HF containing additives such as dimethyl sulfide, anisole, thioanisoie, or p-cresol at 0°C is the preferred<br>
10     method for cleaving the peptide from the resin. The cleavage of the peptide can also be accomplished by other acid reagents such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid/ trifluoroacetic acid mixtures. If the Fmoc protection method is used, the N-terminal Fmoc group is cleaved with reagents described earlier. The other protecting groups and the peptide are cleaved from the resin using solution of trifluoroacetic acid and<br>
15     various additives such as anisole, etc.<br>
Synthesis of capping group B and P6, P5, P4, and P3 moieties<br>
Different capping groups B are introduced to protected P4, P5 or P6 or to any peptide segment with an appropriate acyl chloride or sulfonyl chloride that is either commercially available or for which the synthesis is well known in the art.<br>
20     Different P6 to P3 moieties are available commercially or the synthesis is well known in the art.<br>

5 a) Briefly, di-protected malonate Via and 1,2-dihaloalkane Vlb or cyclic sulfate Vic (synthesized according to K. Burgess and Chun-Yen KE (Synthesis, (1996), 1463-1467) are reacted under basic conditions to give the diester Vld.<br>
b) A regioselective hydrolysis of the less hindered ester is performed to give the acid Vie.<br>
10     c) This acid Vie is subjected to a Curtius rearrangement to give a racemic mixture of 1-aminocyclopropylcarboxyiic acid derivatives Vlf with R1 being syn to the carboxyl group. A specific embodiment for this synthesis is presented in Example 5.<br>
d, e) Alternatively, selective ester formation from the acid Vie with an appropriate<br><br>
halide (PXf) or alcohol (P*OH) forms diester Vlg in which the P* ester is compatible with the selective hydrolysis of the P ester. Hydrolysis of P ester provides acid Vlh.<br>
f) A Curtius rearrangement on Vlh gives a racemic mixture of 1-aminocyc/opropylcarboxyfic acid derivatives Vii with R1 group being antito the carboxyl group. A specific embodiment for this synthesis is presented in Example 10<br>
An alternative synthesis for the preparation of derivatives Vlf (when R1 is vinyl, syn to the carboxyl group) is described below.<br>

Compound 18b, i.e. corresponding to compound 5f of Example 5, was coupled to the preformed tripeptide 18a described previously in Example 15. More specifically, compound 18b (ca.0.521 mmol) was combined with compound 18a (323.6 mg,<br><br>
0.547 mmol) in DCM (3 mL) and NMM (172 ^L, 1.562 mmol), followed by the addition of HATU (237.6 mg, 0.625 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 18 h, after which it was worked up as described for compound 15d to give the crude tetrapeptide as a racemic mixture at P1. Both isomers were partially 5     separated by flash chromatography (eluent- toluene : EtOAc ; 40:60). Combination of the first eluting fractions gave a 9:1 mixture in which analogous fert-butyl ester of 17f was the major component (58 mg). The middle fractions contain different ratios of the corresponding tert-butyl esters of 17f and compound 105 f-butyl ester (163 mg). The latter eluting fractions provided the corresponding tert-butyl ester of compound 10     105 as the major isomer (75.8 mg).<br>
The latter ester (74 mg, 0.0975 mmol) was dissolved in 4N HCI/dioxane (2 mL), stirred at RT for 5.5 h then evaporated to dryness to give an oil. Purification by flash chromatography (eluent- 1st EtOAc, then 2nd 1.92% HOAc, 3.85% MeOH, in DCM) yielded, after lyophilization, compound 105 as a white-amorphous solid (38.7 mg,<br>

EXAMPLE 30<br>
Cloning, expression and purification of the recombinant HCV NS3 protease 20     type 1b.<br>
Serum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained through an external collaboration (Bernard Willems MD, Hopital St-Luc, Montreal, Canada and Dr. Donald Murphy, Laboratoire de Sante Publique du Quebec, Ste-Anne de Bellevue, Canada). An engineered full-length cDNA template of the HCV genome was constructed from 25     DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA and using specific primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype 1b strains. From the determination of the entire genomic sequence, a genotype 1b was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol., (1993), 31, p.1493-1503). The amino acid sequence of the non-30     structural region, NS2-NS4B, was shown to be greater than 93% identical to HCV genotype 1b (BK, JK and 483 isolates) and 88% identical to HCV genotype 1a (HCV-1 isolate). A DNA fragment encoding the polyprotein precursor (NS3/NS4A/NS4B/NS5A/NS5B) was generated by PCR and introduced into<br><br><br>
eukaryotic expression vectors. After transient transfection, the polyprotein processing mediated by the HCV NS3 protease was demonstrated by the presence of the mature NS3 protein using Western blot analysis. The mature NS3 protein was not observed with expression of a polyprotein precursor containing the mutation 5     S1165A, which inactivates the NS3 protease, confirming the functionality of the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
The DNA fragment encoding the recombinant HCV NS3 protease (amino acid 1027 to 1206) was cloned in the pET11d bacterial expression vector. The NS3 protease expression in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was induced by incubation with 1 mM 1PTG<br>
) 0     for 3 h at 22°C. A typical fermentation (18 L) yielded approximately 100 g of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (3.0 mL/g) consisting of 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol (WV), 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40 and stored at -80°C. Cells were thawed and homogenized following the addition of 5 mM DTT. Magnesium chloride and DNase were then added to the homogenate at final<br>
15     concentrations of 20 mM and 20 u.g/ml_ respectively. After a 25 min incubation at 4°C, the homogenate was sonicated and centrifuged at 15000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The pH of the supernatant was then adjusted to 6.5 using a 1M sodium phosphate solution.<br>
An additional gelftitration chromatography step was added to the 2 step punficafjbh 20     procedure described in WO 95/22985 (incorporated herein by reference); Briefly, the supernatant from the bacterial extract was loaded on a SP HIT rap columrY (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated at a flow rate of 2 mUmin in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5,10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% NR-40), The column was then washed with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCI and the protease 25     eluted by applying 10 column volumes of a linear 0.15 to 0.3 M NaCI gradient. NS3 protease-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to a final NaCI concentration of 0.1 M. The enzyme was further purified on a HiTrap Heparin column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The column was 30     then washed with buffer B containing 0.15 M NaCI at a flow rate of 1.5 mUmin. Two step washes were performed in the presence of buffer B containing 0.3 or 1M NaCI. The protease was recovered in the 0.3M NaCI wash, diluted 3-fold with buffer B, reapplied on the HiTrap Heparin column and eluted with buffer B containing 0.4 M NaCI.  Finally, the NS3 protease-containing fractions were applied on a Superdex 75<br><br><br>
HiLoad 16/60 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.3 M NaCI. The purity of the HCV NS3 protease obtained from the pooled fractions was judged to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry analysis.<br>
The enzyme was stored at -80°C and was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>

Recombinant HCV NS3 protease/NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay.<br>
The enzyme was cloned, expressed and prepared according to the protocol described in Example 30. The enzyme was stored at -80°C, thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use in the assay buffer containing the NS4A cofactor peptide.<br>
10 The substrate used for the NS3 protease/ NS4A cofactor peptide radiometric assay, DDIVPCSMSYTW, is cleaved between the cysteine and the serine residues by the enzyme. The sequence DDIVPC-SMSYTW corresponds to the NS5A/NS5B natural cleavage site in which the cysteine residue in P2 has been substituted for a proline. The peptide substrate DDIVPC-SMSYTW and the tracer biotin-DDIVPC-SMS[,25l-<br>
15     YJTW are incubated with trie recombinant NS3 protease and the NS4A peptide<br>
cofactor KKGSWIVGRIILSGRK (molar ratio enzyme: cofactor 1:100) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. The separation of substrate from products is performed by adding avidirw:oated agarose J&gt;eads to the assay mixture followed by filtration. The amount of SMS[125I-YJTW product found in the filtrate allows for the calculation of the<br>
20     percentage of substrate conversion and of the percentage of inhibition.<br>

Blank (no inhibitor and no enzyme) and control (no inhibitor) were also prepared on the same assay plate.<br>
The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme/NS4A peptide solution and the assay mixture was incubated for 40 min at 23°C under gentle 15     agitation. Ten (10) yL of 0.5N NaOH were added and 10 jiL 1 M MES, pH 5.8 were added to quench the enzymatic reaction.<br>
Twenty (20) pL of avidin-coated agarose beads (purchased from Pierce) were added in a Millipore MADP N65 filtration plate. The quenched assay mixture was transferred to the filtration plate, and incubated for 60 min at 23°C under gentle 20     agitation.<br>
The plates were filtered using a Millipore Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold Filtration apparatus, and 40 ul. of the filtrate was transferred in an opaque 96-well plate containing 60 pL of scintillation fluid per well.<br>
The filtrates were counted on a Packard TopCount instrument using a 125l-liquid 25     protocol tor 1 minute.<br>
The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br>
100 - [(countSnh-countSbtanOAcountScB-countSwaniOx 100]<br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (ICso) was calculated by the use of SAS<br>

EXAMPLE 32<br>
Full-length NS3-NS4A heterodimer protein assay<br>
The NS2-NS5B-3" non coding region was cloned by RT-PCR into the pCR®3 vector (Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV genotype 1 b infected 5      individual (provided by Dr. Bernard Willems, Hopital St-Luc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The NS3-NS4A DNA region was then subcloned by PCR into the pFastBac7" HTa baculovirus expression vector (Gibco/BRL). The vector sequence includes a region encoding a 28-residue N-terminal sequence which contains a hexahistidme tag. The Bac-to-Bac™ baculovirus expression system (Gibco/BRL)<br>
10     was used to produce the recombinant baculovirus. The full length mature NS3 and NS4A heterodimer protein (His-NS3-NS4AFL) was expressed by infecting 106 Sf21 cells/mL with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1-0.2 at 27°C. The infected culture was harvested 48 to 64 h later by centrifugation at 4°C. The cell pellet was homogenized in 50mM NaP04l pH 7.5, 40% glycerol (wA/), 2mM<br>
15     B-mercaptoethanol, in presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. His-NS3-NS4AFL was then extracted from the cell lysate with 1.5% NP-40,0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5M NaCI, and a DNase treatment. After ultracentrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 4-fold and bound on a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni-chelating column. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was eluted in a &gt;90% pure form (as judged by SDS-PAGE), using a<br>
20     50 to 400 mM imidazole gradient. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was stored at -80°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 M NaCI, 0.25 M imidazole, 0.1% NP-40. It was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use.<br>
The protease activity of His-NS3-NS4AFL was assayed in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sodium citrate, 0.01% (\NN) n-dodecyl-p-D-maltoside, 1 mM TCEP. Five (5)<br>
25      pM of the internally quenched substrate anthranilyl-DDlVPAbu[C(0)-0]-AMY(3-N02)TW-OH in presence of various concentrations of inhibitor were incubated with 1.5 nM of His-NS3-NS4AFL for 45 min at 23°C. The final DMSO concentration did not exceed 5.25%. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1M MES, pH 5.8. Fluorescence of the N-terminal product was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer LS-<br>
30      50B fluorometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (excitation wavelength: 325 nm; emission wavelength: 423 nm). A non-linear curve fit using the Hill model was then applied to the % inhibition-concentration data and 50% effective concentration (ICM) was calculated through the use of SAS (Statistical Software System.

EXAMPLE 33<br>
NS3 Protease Cell-based assay<br>
This assay was done with Huh-7 cells, a human cell line derived from a hepatoma, 5     co-transfected with 2 DNA constructs:<br>
• one expressing a potyprotein comprising Yn&amp; HCM noTi-slrutttneA proteins toseo to tTA in the following order: NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-ITA (called NS3);<br>
- the other expressing the reporter protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase, under the control of tTA (called SEAP).<br>
10     The polyprotein must be cleaved by the NS3 protease for the mature proteins to be released. Upon release of the mature proteins, it is believed that the viral proteins will form a complex at the merribrane of the endoplasmic reticulum while tTA will migrate to the nucleus and transactivate the SEAP gene. Therefore, reduction of NS3 proteolytic activity should lead to reduction of mature tTA levels and<br>
15     concomitant decrease in SEAP activity.<br>
To control for other effects of the compounds, a parallel transfectjon was done where a construct expressing tTA alone (called tTA) was co-trahsfected with the SEAP construct such that SEAP activity is independent of NS3 proteolytic activity.<br>
Protocol of the assay: Huh-7 cells, grown in CHO-SFMII + 10% FCS (fetal caff 20     serum), were co-transfected with either NS3 and SEAP or tTA and SEAP; using the FuGene protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). After 5 h at 37°, the cells were washed, trypsinized and plated (at 80 000 cells/well) in 96-well plates containirig?a^rahge of concentrations of the compounds to be tested. After a 24-h incubation period, an aliquot of the medium was drawn and the SEAP activity in this aliquot was measured 25     with the Phospha-Light kit (Tropix).<br>
Analysis of the percent inhibition of SEAP activity with respect to compound concentration was performed with the SAS software to obtain the ECSJ.<br>
The toxicity of the compound (TC50) was then assessed using the MTT assay as tattoos.<br>
30     20jiL of a MTT solution (5mg/ml medium) was added per well and incubated at 37°<br>
for 4 hrs;<br><br>
the medium was removed and 50 l of 0.01 N HCI + 10% Triton X-100 was added;<br>
after shaking at RT for at least 1 hr, the OD of each well was read at 595 nm wavelength.<br>
The TC50 was calculated in the same way as the EC50.<br>

Specificity assays<br>
The specificity of the compounds was determined against a variety of serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase and bovine pancreatic a-chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In<br>
10     all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using a colorimetric p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrate specific for each enzyme was used. Each assay included a 1 h enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubation at 30°C followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to =30% conversion as measured on a UV Thermomax® microplate reader. Substrate concentrations were kept as low as possible compared to KM to reduce substrate<br>
15     competition. Compound concentrations varied from 300 to 0.06 jiM depending on their potency. The final conditions for each assay were as follows:<br>
