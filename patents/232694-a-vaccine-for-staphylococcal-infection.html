This invention relates to a vaccine for staphylococcal infections<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to polypeptide formulation for use as a vaccine for the prevention and control of Staphylococcal infections in mammals.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The gram-positive bacteria Staphylococci normally inhabiting skin and mucous membranes in humans, gains access to internal tissues during injury / surgery and causes infection. The bacterium has a characteristic propensity of invading skin and adjacent tissues at sites of prosthetic medical devices, including intravascular catheters, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, hemodialysis shunts, vascular grafts and extended-wear contact lenses (Lowy 1998, Foster 2004). The important pathogens are coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. They cause a variety of diseases ranging from skin diseases, wound sepsis, mastitis to life threatening endocarditis, osteomyelitis, chronic lung infections in human and animals. They are responsible for 1-9% cases of bacterial meningitis and 10-15% cases of brain abscesses (Foster 2004). Mortality due to Staphylococci bacteremia is approximately 20-50 % due to emergence of drug resistance including resistance to Methicillin and Vancomycin (Enright 2002, Mongodin 2003). Staphylococci are the leading cause of community acquired and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections associated with prolonged hospitalization (Franklin 2003).<br>
Staphylococcus virulence is multifactorial, mediated by a number of virulence factors such as alpha, beta, gamma and delta-toxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), enterotoxins, leucocidin, proteases, Staphylokinase, coagulase and clumping factor (Jin 2004, Martin 2003). To initiate invasive infection, Staphylococcus adheres to extracellular matrix substrates and eukaryotic cells by virtue of different surface proteins ("adhesins") (Peacock 2002). These surface proteins produced by Staphylococcus are designated as MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules). These bind specifically to biological substrates such as serum proteins, IgG,<br><br>
fibronectin (Fn), fibrinogen (Fg)5 vitronectin, thrombospondin, thereby masking the bacterium from host's immune system (Hartford 1999, Harris 2002). These surface proteins can also bind to collagen, laminin, glycosaminoglycans and elastin from extra cellular matrix (Snodgrass, 1999) of a wounded tissue or an injured vessel wall, bone sialoprotein, binds to platelets (Siboo 2001) and to non-biological substrates like medical devices (catheters, shunts, pacemakers). All these interactions contribute to colonization of host tissues, but the importance of each of these binding functions in different infections is still unclear (Theresa 1999).<br>
Continued emergence of resistance to antibiotics has incited the need for alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of Staphylococcal diseases. Vaccination has proved relatively unsuccessful against the common mammalian commensal bacteria Staphylococci, despite almost a century of experimentation (Michie 2002). Several researchers have attempted to produce killed, attenuated, fixed or lysed S. aureus vaccines and/or to isolate capsular polysaccharides or cell wall components, which will induce immunity to S. aureus. Nevertheless none of these attempts have been successful. Toxoids induced high antibody titers in several studies, but proved to be unsuccessful vaccine candidates as they induced adverse reactions. The development of polysaccharide antigenic components of the Staphylococcal capsule is complicated by the myriad of strains prevalent in the community. Ali Fattom et al (1996) (Nabi Pharmaceuticals) developed a vaccine (StaphVAX) by linking the polysaccharides type 5 and type 8 purified from S. aureus to a carrier protein (a nontoxic form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin) and demonstrated 56% protection against S. aureus in patients receiving hemodialysis (Shinefield H. 2002). Like previous vaccines, this vaccine also could not provide prolonged protection against invasive Staphylococci even though it had greater efficacy and fewer side effects. Ing-Marie Nilsson et al (1998) demonstrated that vaccination with a recombinant version of the collagen adhesin, protected mice against heterologous challenge of S. aureus. Dr Gerald Pier et al (1999) demonstrated vaccination with purified surface polysaccharide PNSG (poly-N-succinyl Beta-1-6 glucosamine) on S. aureus protected mice against a challenge of S. aureus.<br>
But as of present, there is no vaccine in the market providing full protection against Staphylococcal infections (Michie 2002). Vaccine strategies targeting microbial surface<br><br>
components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) are viable approaches to impede bacterial adherence, prevent colonization, and minimize hematogenous dissemination, thereby halting the inception and progression of infection. Therefore, in search of a novel vaccine candidate, the surface proteins of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were analyzed in-silico. As adherence is the critical step in pathogenesis, the available completed genome sequences in public database of S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains were analyzed in-silico for previously unknown / uncharacterized Staphylococcal adhesins. Here we report immunization of mice with recombinant protein from S. aureus having role in adhesion and autolytic property, giving protection against heterologous challenge of S. aureus and S. epidermidis.<br>
The Following Patients Could Benefit from Vaccine against S.aureus and S. epidermidis: Surgical patients undergoing lengthy cardiac and orthopedic procedures, trauma and burn patients, Patients receiving an implanted medical device or prosthetic, newborns whose immune systems are not yet developed, individuals in long-term care, kidney dialysis patients.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to development of a recombinant protein vaccine from S. aureus, useful for inducing immunity for the prevention and treatment of Staphylococcal infections. The invention further relates to isolation of the protein and purification of the said protein for immunization against the infections associated with S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The invention reveals that protein is also useful for producing antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The instant invention is based on the finding that the protein identified and expressed in S. aureus strain having role in adhesion and is highly immunogenic. The invention further provides method of using purified protein as suitable vaccine candidate. The protein that is expressed and purified under the present invention is identifiable as Accession no GI22217975/EMB CAC80837 (Refer SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3) corresponding to the DNA sequence Accession no GI22217974/EMB AJ250906 (Refer SEQ ID NO: 1) from S. aureus in NCBI database. The above gene and protein sequences have been engineered to reduce or abolish potential protein-protein interactions with cellular and extracellular proteins such as the sequences described in SEQ ID NO: 4 and in SEQ ID NO: 5. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions of protein that can be used as vaccine. The present invention also describes a method of eliciting antigen specific immune response by immunization<br>
The present invention is based on cloning and expression of gene Aaa (SEQ ID NO: 1) encoding a adhesin/autolysin. The gene encodes a protein of 334 amino acids, with 3 repeats of LysM domains that exhibit peptidoglycan binding property, one CHAP domain exhibiting peptidoglycan cleaving property and a typical Gram-positive signal peptide suggesting that the protein is a cell wall protein. Because bacterial adherence is the first critical step in the development of most infections, it is an attractive target for the development of novel vaccines. To determine if adhesion based vaccine could prevent S. aureus infection, mice were actively immunized with recombinant protein and challenged intravenously and intraperitoneally with S. aureus. And the immunized mice showed reduced or no colony forming units when kidneys were processed.<br><br>
An ELISA method has been developed for the assay of the protein and could be used as diagnostic method for the detection of the antigen or the antibodies to this protein in infected samples.<br>
The following figures and examples are included for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Example 1<br>
in-silico Analysis: The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of both Aaa (Autolysin /<br>
adhesin of S. aureus - SEQ ID NO:2) and Aae (Autolysin / adhesin of S. epidermidis)<br>
were aligned and compared by CLUSTALW and TEXSHADE at Biology Workbench<br>
3.2 (http://workbench.sdsc.edu/) and showed they are very similar as shown in fig 1 . The<br>
Aaa amino acid sequence was submitted to Pfam version 17.0<br>
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) for domain analysis. Pfam domain analysis<br>
showed Aaa protein contains 3 repeats of LysM domains and 1 CHAP domain as shown<br>
in fig 2. The LysM (lysin motif) domain is about 40 residues long and present between<br>
the residues 4-47, 68 - 111 and 135 - 178. It is found in a variety of enzymes involved in<br>
bacterial cell wall degradation and has a general peptidoglycan binding function. The<br>
CHAP domain (cysteine, histidine-dependent amido hydrolases/peptidases) is about 120<br>
residues long and present between residues 191 - 310. CHAP domain is involved in<br>
amidase function and many of the proteins having CHAP domain are involved in cell<br>
wall metabolism of bacteria. The servers Signal P 3.0<br>
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/),	Target	P	1.1	server<br>
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/)	and	PSORT	version	6.4<br>
(http://www.psort.org/) predicted protein Aaa has signal peptide of 25 residues and is located on cell wall. Example 2<br>
Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions and Vectors: E. coli strain DH5a was used for DNA manipulations and E. coli vector pETllb used for cloning and expression of the autolysin adhesin gene. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 RIL. Staphylococci strains used in animal experiments were S. aureus (MSSA) ATCC 25923, S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591, clinical isolate of S. aureus (Methicillin resistant - MRSA) from the femur of a hospitalized patient and S. epidermidis ATCC<br><br>
12228. These S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains were cultured on blood agar for 24 h, then grown in tryptic soy broth containing 5% filtered serum till late log phase, harvested, washed, diluted in PBS to an appropriate concentration and viable counts were determined by pour-plate method for inoculation in mice. The E. coli strains containing the pET15b or pETllb vectors were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB)-broth / agar containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin. S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains were grown in Vogel Johnson agar containing 0.1% potassium tellurite. Example 3<br>
Cloning and Sequencing of the Gene Encoding Protein antigen: All DNA<br>
manipulations were performed using standard methods. Genomic DNA was isolated from<br>
S. aureus (ATCC 25293) according to Lindberg et al (1972). Oligonucleotides were<br>
designed to amplify the gene fragment corresponding to mature protein of S. aureus<br>
autolysin adhesin (Aaa) gene (Accession no AJ250906.1 gi|22217974; contained within<br>
SEQ ID NO:l; the mature protein sequence is SEQ ID NO:3). The sequence of the<br>
forward	primer	used	for	amplification	by	PCR	is:<br>
5'CGAGCTCCATATGGCTACAACTCACACAGTAAAAC3' and reverse primer sequence:<br>
5fCGCTCGAGGGATCCTTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAATATATCTAT AATTATTTAC 3'. Nucleotide sequence corresponding to 6 Histidine tag was included in reverse primer. The amplified gene product was purified from agarose gel, digested with the restriction enzymes Ndel and BamHl and ligated by T4 DNA ligase into pETllb vector cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. The ligated vector was transformed into E. coli DH5a strain by CaCb method. Clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing by dideoxy chain termination method using the ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencing machine. The PC-gene program (Intelligenetics) was used for the handling of the sequences. Plasmid containing Aaa gene was isolated and transformed into E. coli BL21 (XDE3) RIL strain for expression of the target protein.<br>
The gene encoding the protein sequences described in SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5 were designed after deletion of the potential protein-protein interaction sites of the Aaa gene encoding the protein of SEQ ID NO: 3. The gene encoding protein sequences as in SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5 were synthesized at GenScript Corporation, USA. The ORF encoding the engineered proteins have been cloned into EcoRl and BamHl site of<br><br>
pGSlOO vector under the control of heat inducible promoter and have been transformed inEco//BL21(ADE3)RIL. Example 4<br>
Protein Expression and Purification: Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 DE3 RIL cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pETllb were diluted 1:50 in 1 liter of Luria Broth containing 50^g/ml ampicillin. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking to get an A600 of 0.6, whereupon the expression of the target protein by T7 polymerase was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were harvested after 4 hr by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Phosphate Buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0, 4 M Urea, 1% Triton X 100, ImM PMSF). The cells were lysed by sonication at 15 microns amplitude for duration of 60 sec with an interval of 60 sec on ice for 30 cycles and the bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min to remove bacterial debris. As the target protein formed inclusion bodies, the cell lysate pellet were washed twice with the same buffer excluding PMSF and washed twice with the same buffer excluding Urea and Triton X 100 to remove them.<br>
The pellet containing target protein was solubilised by suspending it in 10 volumes of 50 mM Phosphate Buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, 6 M Urea, pH 8.0, and kept on stirrer. After 4 hrs of solubilisation, centrifugation was carried out at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing soluble proteins was filtered through a 0.4 |im membrane and retained for further purification. The recombinant proteins were purified by immobilizing on Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography. A column containing Ni-NTA matrix, connected to a FPLC system, was equilibrated with buffer A containing 50mM Phosphate Buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, 6 M Urea, pH 8.0. After equilibration, the supernatant was applied to the column and the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer. Subsequently, the column was eluted with buffer B containing, 50mM Phosphate Buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, 6M Urea, pH 8, 20-200 mM imidazole. The elutions were monitored for protein by checking absorbance at 280 nm and peak fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig 3). Example 5<br>
Occurrence of autolysin adhesin in S. aureus and S. epidermidisz The presence of the autolysin adhesin gene in various clinical strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was<br><br>
determined by PCR. The clinical strains were isolated form the patients suffering from sepsis, device associated infections, skin infections, renal dialysis infections, etc. The protein autolysin (Aaa) adhesin was found to be present in all the six strains of S. aureus completed genome sequences and in two strains of S. epidermidis completed genome sequences. Presence of the autolysin adhesin gene in the clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was confirmed by PCR as shown in fig 4. This shows that the autolysin adhesion (Aaa) protein is expressed in majority of the 5. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Example 6<br>
Assay of Peptidoglycan Hydrolytic Activities - zymographic assay: The staphylolytic activity of the Aaa protein was determined by performing a zymogram on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel as per the method described earlier with slight modifications. Briefly, 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared containing 0.2 % (w/v) heat killed S. aureus cells as substrate. The recombinant purified protein was loaded and electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA constant current using a vertical slab gel electrophoresis assembly (Hoefer miniVE) at 4°C. Following the electrophoresis, the gel was washed thoroughly with cold distilled water containing 0.1 % TritonX 100 and the gel was incubated overnight at 37°C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. Similar assay was carried out with S. epidermidis as a substrate. Lytic bands in the translucent gel were visualized as clear bands against a blue background in an indirect light as shown in fig 5. Example 7<br>
IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF Staphylococcal INFECTIONS:<br>
ELISA: Sera from mice and humans were tested for antibodies against Aaa autolysin adhesin recombinant protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microtiter wells were coated with purified protein (1 mg/ml) in lOOjal coating buffer (100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.2) per well and incubated overnight at 4°C. Additional protein binding sites were blocked with 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 200 jil/well of in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.13 M NaCl) at room temperature for 1 hr and washed five times with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). 100 jal of Mice and Human sera specimens diluted in PBST<br><br>
were added to different wells and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Unbound antibody was removed by washing the wells five times with PBST. For detection of bound antibody, 100(^1 of Horse Radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted to 1:8,000 in PBST and lOOjil of Horse Radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody diluted to 1:8,000 in PBST were added in respective wells and incubated for lhr at 37°C. After washing the wells, Antigen-Antibody complexes were quantified by measuring the conversion of the substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) and H202, to colored product by the conjugated enzyme, at OD 492 nm on a micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad). Both groups of infected mice and human showed positive results in ELISA. This indicates antibodies against the protein autolysin/adhesin of S.aureus would be produced in-vivo, and is immunogenic.

Western Blot: Recombinant protein was run on a 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 200mA using transfer buffer, CAPS buffer, pH 8.3. The membrane was then treated with a solution containing 5% (wt/vol) dried skim milk in PBS for 1 hr, followed by three washing with PBS and then incubation with high titer sera raised against the protein in mouse diluted 200 fold in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (positive control), and pooled sera from S. aureus infected mice, pooled sera from S. aureus infected human and control mouse and human sera for 1 hr at 37°C. Membranes were then washed three times in PBST and subsequently incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in 2,000-fold-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in PBST, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG in PBST respectively. After washing, the membrane was treated with chromogenic substrate Diamino Benzedene (DAB) and H2O2. Control mouse and control human sera did not show any bands where as positive control and S. aureus infected mice and human showed positive bands corresponding to the target protein as shown in fig 6,. This indicates that antibodies are produced in mice and humans, against the protein when infected with S. aureus. Example 9<br>
Opsonophagocytic assay: To determine whether antibodies produced against protein Aaa are effective in mediating the killing of S. aureus, an in vitro opsonization assay was<br><br>
done. Assay was done by a modified protocol of McKenney D 2000. Purified protein Aaa was injected into rabbit to get hyperimmune sera, a rich source of antibodies against the protein. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils were prepared from fresh blood collected from healthy adult rabbit. A total of 25 ml rabbit blood was mixed with an equal volume of dextran-heparin-sulfate buffer (20 g of Dextran 500/liter, 65.6 g of heparin sulfate/liter, 9 g of sodium chloride/liter) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The upper layer containing leukocytes was collected, and hypotonic lysis of the remaining erythrocytes was accomplished by resuspension in 1% NH4CI. Subsequent wash steps were performed with RPMI with 15% fetal bovine serum. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil count was adjusted to 4 x 106 neutrophils per ml. The complement source (guinea pig complement) was adsorbed with S. aureus to remove antibodies that could react with the target strain. After overnight growth in tryptic soy broth, S. aureus cells were centrifuged, the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The opsonophagocytic assay was performed with 100 \xl of leukocytes, 100 |al of bacteria (adjusted to 2x 10 /ml PBS), 100 |il of the high titer serum dilution and 100 (il of the complement source. The reaction mixture was incubated on a rotor rack at 37°C for 90 min; samples were taken at time zero and after 90 min. Each tube was sonicated for 5 sec at 4 W and then diluted in tryptic soy broth containing 0.5% Tween and plated onto Vogel Johnson agar plates. Tubes lacking any serum and tubes with normal rabbit serum were used as controls. The assay was done by test serum showed reduced number of colonies compare to control assay. These showed antibodies against protein Aaa are effective in mediating the killing of S. aureus by phagocytes.<br>
Example 10<br>
DEVELOPMENT    OF    VACCINE    FORMULATION    AND    EFFICACACY<br>
STUDIES:<br>
The recombinant purified protein along with above mentioned PBS, adjuvant is mixed with at least one of the following stabilizers used in the concentration range of 0.05% to 5% , such as polyols (Mannitol, Sorbiltol, Glycerol), sugars (Lactose, Trehalose, Sucrose), human serum albumin, amino acids (Glutamate, arginine, histidine). Immunization and challenging of Mice: Purified, filter sterilized recombinant autolysin adhesin protein (final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) and BSA of same concentration was suspended in sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline -  lOmM Phosphate Buffer<br><br>
containing 0.13M Sodium Chloride, pH-7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml Aluminum hydroxide (an adjuvant). Vaccine formulation comprising 500 JLLI of the emulsion containing the purified protein (l-1000micrograms) as antigen was injected into mice (4 groups of mice containing 18 in each groups A, B, C, D) intraperitonealy (i.p.) on day 0 and 500 \il of BSA suspension injected in to 4 groups of mice containing 15 in each groups:- Control A, Control B, Control C, Control D. On day 14 a booster dose of the protein was injected to Groups A, B, C and D and BSA were injected in control groups. Challenging was done with four different strains of Staphylococci at sub lethal dose to quantify the bacterial vegetation. 10 mice in groups A and A control were challenged by injecting 3.4 X 108 cells of ATCC MSSA per mouse via i.v. 10 mice in groups B and B control were challenged by injecting 3.8 X 108 cells of ATCC MRSA per mouse via i.v. 10 mice in groups C and C control were challenged by injecting 3.2 X 106 cells of Clinical MRSA per mouse via i.v. 10 mice in groups D and D control were challenged by injecting 4xl08 cells of ATCC S. epidermidis per mouse i.v. 5 mice in all groups were removed and kept in separate cages at the time of challenging and sera was collected form these mice after 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks after last immunization to assay specific IgG antibodies against autolysin adhesin. These experiments were also repeated with intraperitoneal inoculation of S.aureus. Example 11<br>
Bacterial Investigation: After 72 hrs of challenging, all mice were sacrificed, dissected and kidneys were removed aseptically for bacterial investigations. Kidneys were washed with ethyl alcohol and sterile PBS to remove surface attached bacteria and homogenized separately in a sterile pestle mortar. To quantify the bacteria 10 fold serial dilution was carried out till a dilution of 10*5 in sterile PBS. 1ml of 10"3 to 10"5 dilutions were plated by pour plate method using Vogel Johnson agar (VJ agar) containing 1% Potassium Tellurite and incubated at 37°C. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted after 36 hr and 48hrs of incubation. For identification of peritoneal vegetation, 2 ml of sterile PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each mouse, the abdomen of each mouse was massaged for 2 min, and a sample of the lavage fluid was drawn by a syringe and cultured in cooked meat media. Blood culture also was done for identifying any systemic infection. Bacteria were also tested for catalase and coagulase activity.<br><br>
All the animals used in this study survived S. aureus and S. epidermidis challenge. The number of bacteria in the kidneys from mice vaccinated and non vaccinated controls were as follows: positive controls demonstrated 1.0 up to 8.1 X 106 cfu per pair of kidney per mouse; mice challenged with 3.4 X 108 cells of MSSA ATCC 25923 (Group A) demonstrated 0 up to 7X10 cfu per pair of kidney with only 2 out of 10 mice showed mild infection; mice challenged with 3.8 X 108 cells of MRSA ATCC 33591 (Group B) demonstrated 0 up to 5.1 X 104 cfu per pair of kidney with only 3 out of 10 mice showing mild infection; mice challenged with 3.2 X 106 cells of Clinical MRSA (A multi drug resistant strain isolated from femur bone of a hospitalized patient) (Group C) demonstrated 0 up to 9 X 103 cfu per pair of kidney with only 3 out of 10 mice showing mild infection and mice challenged with 4 X 108 cells of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (Group D) demonstrated 0 up to 1 X 104 cfu per pair of kidney with only 2 out of 10 mice showing mild infection. The number of bacteria (cfu)/ pair of kidneys in each animal analyzed is shown in table 1. Sera samples were tested for antibody titer after 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks after last immunization and demonstrated very high titer even 9 weeks after immunization as shown in fig 8.<br><br><br>
Fisher test was applied to determine the significance of the differences between vaccinated and control groups. The reduction of the bacterial count in kidneys from immunized mice was significant. Kidneys from 80 % of the immunized mice in group A, 70 % in groups B and C did not show the presence of bacteria after S. aureus challenge and 80 % of the immunized mice in group D did not show the presence of bacteria after S. epidermidis challenge as shown in table 2. Each group log mean CFU is significantly different from the mean CFU of control group as shown in table 3. From the means, we can see that the infection is much higher among mice in control group than that of the vaccinated groups as shown in fig 7. The difference between the controls groups (Control A-D) and the vaccinated groups (Group A-D) were statistically significant as shown in table 4.<br>
Table 2. Frequencies and Percentages of mice based on infection status<br><br><br><br><br>
Both the groups were observed for the mortality for 48 hours. The test group (n=8) survived the S. aureus challenge. However 100% mortality was observed in control group (n=8) of animals.<br>
