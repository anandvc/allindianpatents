				<td>DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR VALVE ACTUATION MECHANISM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to variable valve actuation<br>
systems, and more particularly to diagnostic systems for variable valve actuation<br>
systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Vehicles include an internal combustion engine that generates<br>
drive torque. More specifically, an intake valve is selectively opened to draw air<br>
into the cylinders of the engine. The air is mixed with fuel to form a combustion<br>
mixture. The combustion mixture is compressed within the cylinders and is<br>
combusted to drive pistons within the cylinders. An exhaust valve selectively<br>
opens to allow the exhaust gas to exit from the cylinders after combustion.<br>
[0004] A rotating cam shaft regulates the opening and closing of the<br>
intake and exhaust valves. The camshaft includes a plurality of cam lobes that<br>
rotate with the camshaft. The profile of the cam lobe determines the valve lift<br>
schedule. More specifically, the valve lift schedule includes the amount of time<br>
the valve is open (duration) and the magnitude or degree to which the valve<br>
opens (lift).<br>
[0005] Variable valve actuation (WA) technology improves fuel<br>
economy, engine efficiency, and/or performance by modifying a valve lift event,<br><br><br>
timing, and duration as a function of engine operating conditions. Two-step VVA<br>
systems include variable valve assemblies such as hydraulically controlled<br>
switchable roller finger followers (SRFFs). SRFFs enable two discrete valve<br>
states (e.g. a low lift state or a high lift state) on the intake and/or exhaust valves.<br>
[0006] Referring to FIG. 1, a hydraulic lift mechanism (i.e. a SRFF<br>
mechanism) 10 is shown in more detail. Those skilled in the art can appreciate<br>
that the SRFF mechanism 10 is merely exemplary in nature. The SRFF<br>
mechanism 10 is pivotally mounted on a hydraulic lash adjuster 12 and contacts<br>
the valve stem 14 of an inlet valve 16 that selectively opens and closes an inlet<br>
passage 18 to a cylinder 20. The engine inlet valve 16 is selectively lifted and<br>
lowered in response to rotation of an inlet camshaft 22 on which multiple cam<br>
lobes (e.g. low lift cam lobe 24 and high lift cam lobe 26) are mounted. The inlet<br>
camshaft 22 rotates about an inlet camshaft axis 28. Although the exemplary<br>
embodiment describes the SRFF mechanism 10 operating on the engine inlet<br>
valve 16, those skilled in the art can appreciate that a SRFF mechanism may<br>
operate similarly on an exhaust valve 30.<br>
[0007] A control module transitions a SRFF mechanism from a low lift<br>
state to a high lift state and vice versa based on demanded engine speed and<br>
load. For example, an internal combustion engine operating at an elevated<br>
engine speed such as 4,000 revolutions per minute (RPMs) typically requires the<br>
SRFF mechanism to operate in a high lift state to avoid potential hardware<br>
damage to the internal combustion engine.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] A diagnostic system for an engine includes a pressure<br>
monitoring module that determines a plurality of first average pressure values<br>
and a plurality of second average pressure values of a fluid supply provided to a<br>
camshaft phaser. A diagnostic module identifies one of a plurality of cylinders<br>
associated with a failed variable valve lift mechanism based on the first and said<br>
second average pressure values. Each of the first and the second average<br>
pressure values respectively correspond to each of the plurality of cylinders.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, activated<br>
refers to operation using all of the engine cylinders. Deactivated refers to<br>
operation using less than all of the cylinders of the engine (one or more cylinders<br>
not active). As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or<br>
group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a<br>
combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide the<br>
described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 2, an engine system 40 includes an<br>
engine 42 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 44 through a throttle 46. The throttle 46 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 44. Air within the intake manifold 44 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 48. Although six cylinders 48 are illustrated, it is<br>
appreciated that the diagnostic system of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders including, but not limited<br>
to, 2, 3,4, 5, 8, 10, and 12 cylinders.<br><br>
[0017] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that is combined with the<br>
air as it is drawn into the cylinder 48 through an intake port. The fuel injector<br>
may be an injector associated with an electronic or mechanical fuel injection<br>
system, a jet or port of a carburetor or another system for mixing fuel with intake<br>
air. The fuel injector is controlled to provide a desired air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio within<br>
each cylinder 48.<br>
[0018] An intake valve 52 selectively opens and closes to enable the<br>
air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 48. The intake valve position is regulated by<br>
an intake camshaft 54. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture<br>
within the cylinder 48. A spark plug 56 initiates combustion of the air/fuel<br>
mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 48. The piston drives a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 48 is<br>
forced out an exhaust port when an exhaust valve 58 is in an open position. The<br>
exhaust valve position is regulated by an exhaust camshaft 60. The exhaust is<br>
treated in an exhaust system. Although single intake and exhaust valves 52 and<br>
58 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 42 can include multiple<br>
intake and exhaust valves 52 and 58 per cylinder 48.<br>
[0019] The engine system 40 may include an intake cam phaser 62<br>
and an exhaust cam phaser 64 that respectively regulate the rotational timing of<br>
the intake and exhaust camshafts 54 and 60. More specifically, the timing or<br>
phase angle of the respective intake and exhaust camshafts 54 and 60 can be<br>
retarded or advanced with respect to each other or with respect to a location of<br>
the piston within the cylinder 48 or with respect to crankshaft position.<br><br>
[0020] In this manner, the position of the intake and exhaust valves 52<br>
and 58 can be regulated with respect to each other or with respect to a location<br>
of the piston within the cylinder 48. By regulating the position of the intake valve<br>
52 and the exhaust valve 58, the quantity of air/fuel mixture ingested into the<br>
cylinder 48, and therefore the engine torque, is regulated.<br>
[0021] The cam phaser 62 can include a phaser actuator 65 that is<br>
either electrically or hydraulically actuated. Hydraulically actuated phaser<br>
actuators 65, for example, include an electrically-controlled fluid control valve<br>
(OCV) 66 that controls a fluid supply flowing into or out of the phaser actuator 65.<br>
[0022] Additionally, low lift cam lobes (not shown) and high lift cam<br>
lobes (not shown) are mounted to each of the intake and exhaust camshafts 54,<br>
60. The low lift cam lobes and high lift cam lobes rotate with the intake and<br>
exhaust camshafts 54 and 60 and are in operative contact with a hydraulic lift<br>
mechanism such as a switching roller finger follower (SRFF) mechanism as<br>
depicted in FIG. 1. Typically, distinct SRFF mechanisms operate on each of the<br>
intake and exhaust valves 52 and 58 of each cylinder 48. In the present<br>
implementation, each cylinder 48 includes two SRFF mechanisms.<br>
[0023] Each SRFF mechanism provides two levels of valve lift for one<br>
of the intake and exhaust valves 52 and 58. The two levels of valve lift include a<br>
low lift and high lift and are based on the low lift cam lobes and high lift cam<br>
lobes, respectively. During "normal" operation (i.e. low lift operation or a low lift<br>
state), a low lift cam lobe causes the SRFF mechanism to pivot to a second<br>
position in accordance with the prescribed geometry of the low lift cam lobe and<br><br>
thereby open one of the intake and exhaust valves 52 and 58 a first<br>
predetermined amount. During high lift operation (i.e. a high lift state), a high lift<br>
cam lobe causes the SRFF mechanism to pivot to a third position in accordance<br>
with the prescribed geometry of the high lift cam lobe and thereby opening one of<br>
the intake and exhaust valves 52 and 58 to open a second predetermined<br>
amount greater than the first predetermined amount.<br>
[0024] A position sensor 68 senses a position of the cam phaser 62<br>
and generates a cam phaser position signal indicative of the position of the cam<br>
phaser 62. A pressure sensor 70 generates a pressure signal indicating a<br>
pressure of the fluid supply supplied to the phaser actuator 65 of the cam phaser<br>
62. It is anticipated that one or more pressure sensors 70 can be implemented.<br>
An engine speed sensor 72 is responsive to a rotational speed of the engine 42<br>
and generates an engine speed signal in revolutions per minute (RPM).<br>
[0025] A control module 74 includes a processor and memory such as<br>
random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and/or other suitable<br>
electronic storage. The control module 74 communicates with the position<br>
sensor 68, the pressure sensor 70, and the engine speed sensor 72. The control<br>
module 74 may receive input from other sensors 76 of the exemplary vehicle 40<br>
including, but not limited to, oxygen sensors, engine coolant temperature<br>
sensors, and/or mass airflow sensors.<br>
[0026] The control module 74 executes a diagnostic system of the<br>
present invention. The diagnostic system detects a failure state of one of the<br>
SRFF mechanisms of the engine 42 based at least on the engine speed and<br><br>
pressure signals transmitted from the speed sensor 72 and the pressure sensor<br>
70, respectively. More specifically, the diagnostic system identifies one of the<br>
cylinders 48 associated with the failed SRFF mechanism, thereby enabling the<br>
control module 74 to command remedial actions (e.g. limiting engine speed) in<br>
order to prevent damage to the engine 42.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 3, the control module 74 is shown in more<br>
detail. The control module 74 includes an exemplary diagnostic system 100 of<br>
the present invention. The diagnostic system 100 includes a pressure monitoring<br>
module 102 and a diagnostic module 104.<br>
[0028] In the present implementation, a diagnostic system enablement<br>
module 106 communicates with the engine speed sensor 72, the position sensor<br>
60, and other sensors 76. The diagnostic system enablement module 106<br>
determines whether to enable to the diagnostic system 100 by verifying that<br>
various enablement conditions are met. The enablement conditions can include<br>
ensuring that the engine speed of the engine 42 falls below an engine speed<br>
threshold (e.g. 2000 RPM) and that the cam phaser 62 remains in a steady-state<br>
operating position. In other words, the diagnostic system enablement module<br>
106 verifies that the engine 42 is operating in a "normal" or low lift state. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that various other enablement conditions are<br>
contemplated. If the enablement conditions are met, the diagnostic system<br>
enablement module 106 enables the diagnostic system 100.<br>
[0029] The pressure monitoring module 102 communicates with the<br>
pressure sensor 70, the diagnostic system enablement module 106, and the<br><br>
diagnostic module 104. The pressure monitoring module 102 monitors pressure<br>
variations generated by the fluid supply at the cam phaser 62 that occur while<br>
opening each of the intake valves 52 (i.e. operation the SRFF mechanisms) of<br>
the cylinders 48. Please note that although the present implementation<br>
describes the diagnostic system with respect to the intake valves 52, those<br>
skilled in the art can appreciate that the pressure monitoring principles of the<br>
present disclosure are also applicable to the exhaust valves 58.<br>
[0030] More specifically, the pressure monitoring module 102<br>
determines an average low lift pressure value corresponding to each of the<br>
cylinders 48 based on input received from the pressure sensor 70. The pressure<br>
signal is based on the energy required to open each of the intake valves 52.<br>
Therefore, the pressure monitoring module 102 correlates pressure data (e.g.<br>
average low lift pressure values and average high lift pressure values) to one of<br>
the cylinders 48. In the present implementation, each average low lift pressure<br>
value is determined over a calibrated number (e.g. 8) revolutions of the engine<br>
42.<br>
[0031] Upon determining an average low lift pressure value<br>
corresponding to each of the cylinders 48, the diagnostic module 104 commands<br>
the engine 42 to transition to high lift operation. In other words, the diagnostic<br>
module 104 commands each of the SRFF mechanisms to pivot to the third<br>
position in accordance with the prescribed geometry of the high lift cam lobe.<br>
Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the present invention anticipates<br><br>
executing the diagnostic system 100 while operating the engine 42 in the high lift<br>
state and subsequently transitioning the engine 42 to the low lift state.<br>
[0032] The pressure monitoring module 102 determines an average<br>
high lift pressure value of the fluid supply corresponding to each of the cylinders<br>
48 after the engine 42 is transitioned to operate in the high lift state. The<br>
pressure monitoring module 102 determines each average high lift pressure<br>
value over the calibrated number of revolutions of the engine 42. In the present<br>
implementation, the pressure monitoring module 102 observes a calibrated wait<br>
period (e.g. 4 revolutions of the engine 42) to ensure the engine 42 has properly<br>
transitioned to the high lift state. The pressure monitoring module 102 then<br>
calculates a pressure difference between the average low lift pressure value and<br>
the high lift pressure value corresponding to each of the cylinders 48.<br>
[0033] The diagnostic module 104 communicates with the pressure<br>
monitoring module 102. The diagnostic module 104 determines whether a SRFF<br>
mechanism associated with one of the cylinders 48 has failed based on the<br>
pressure differences. The diagnostic module 104 individually compares each of<br>
the pressure differences corresponding to the cylinders 48 to a pressure<br>
threshold. In the present implementation, the pressure threshold is<br>
approximately 2.5 pounds per square inch (PSI). Other pressure thresholds are<br>
anticipated. If the diagnostic module 104 determines that one of the pressure<br>
differences is below the pressure threshold, the diagnostic module 104 generates<br>
and transmits a failure control signal identifying the cylinder 48 corresponding to<br>
the pressure difference (i.e. the pressure difference falling below the pressure<br><br>
threshold). In other words, the diagnostic module 104 identifies a cylinder 48<br>
associated with a SRFF mechanism that has failed to transition from the low lift<br>
state to the high lift state. The control module 74 may command remedial action<br>
to prevent damage to the engine 42 based on the failure control signal.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 4 an exemplary method 400 for<br>
controlling the diagnostic system will be described in more detail. Control begins<br>
the method 400 in step 402. In step 404, control determines whether the<br>
enablement conditions have been satisfied. If the enablement conditions have<br>
not been satisfied, the method 400 proceeds to step 418. If the enablement<br>
conditions have been satisfied, control proceeds step 406.<br>
[0035] In step 406, control determines first average pressure values<br>
(e.g. average low lift pressure values) corresponding to each of the cylinders 48.<br>
In step 408, control commands the engine 42 to transition from a first lift state<br>
(e.g. the low lift state) to a second lift state (e.g. the high lift state). In step 410,<br>
control determines second average pressure values (e.g. average high lift<br>
pressure values) corresponding to each of the cylinders 48. In step 412, control<br>
determines pressure differences corresponding to each of the cylinders 48.<br>
[0036] In step 414, control determines whether at least one of the<br>
pressure differences determined in step 412 falls below the pressure threshold.<br>
If the pressure differences exceed the pressure threshold, control determines<br>
that no SRFF mechanism failure exists and returns to step 404. If at least one<br>
pressure difference exceeds the pressure threshold, control proceeds to step<br><br>
416. In step 416, control transmits a failure control signal identifying at least one<br>
cylinder 48 associated with the SRFF mechanism failure.<br>
[0037] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
