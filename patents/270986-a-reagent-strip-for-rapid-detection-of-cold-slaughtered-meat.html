				<td>This invention relates to A Reagent Strip for Rapid Detection of Cold Slaughtered Meat, A Process for Preparing the Same and A Method of Detection.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates particularly to reagent strip for detection of cold slaughtered meat that is easy to handle and suitable for field conditions. More particularly, the invention relates to a strip involving malachite green as the principal ingredient. Further, the invention relates particularly to a reagent strip that is stable under ambient conditions. The invention also relates to a process for preparing the reagent strip. Specifically, the process is simple, does not require any stringent processing conditions, sophisticated infra structure, and skilled personnel. The ingredients required are easily available. Additionally, the invention relates to a method of detection that is rapid, economic, user friendly, operable at field conditions and precise. The entire test period taken to detect the cold slaughtered meat is about 2 to 5 minutes. No trained or skilled personnel are required to conduct the test. The test requires a very small sample of meat containing around 0.025% hemoglobin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Cold slaughtered mutton is derived from dead animals where the death could be natural or due to stress strain or disease. Cold slaughtered meat could be detected by the careful detailed post-mortem examination of the various organs of the carcasses by veterinary doctors, supplemented with adequate bacteriological test. This is not applicable to the dressed carcasses (without the organs) supplied by the contractors. In accordance with Thornton (Text Book of meat inspection Bailliere, Tindall and Cassde, London, 1968), slaughter of the animal at the point of death or the slaughter of dead animal results in imperfect bleeding. It can be detected by careful post-mortem examination of the various organs. Unbled or badly bled carcasses undergo rapid decomposition and must therefore be condemned. The carcasses of dead animals are unwholesome, liable to rapid decomposition and are thus unfit for consumption. According to Melrose and Gracey, the<br>
human health risk has increased probably due to using contaminated meat that might have spread its infecting organisms to clean meat when processed into sausages and pies (A reference may be made to a Book by Melrose and Gracey, 1975, titled "The implication of disease in the meat industry"). The reason being, the subsequent cooking does not kill these organisms and food poisoning can result.<br>
Meat hygiene is important to providing wholesome meat for human consumption and preventing danger to public health. Inspection of meat may be conducted by examination of live animals on entry to the slaughterhouse (ante-mortem inspection), and examination of the carcass and any food products made from the meat after slaughter (post-mortem inspection). Of the two, the most important is the ante-mortem inspection without which no adequate inspection of the meat or carcass is possible. In case of emergency slaughter or slaughter of sick animals, it is difficult for meat inspector to form his judgement without ante-mortem inspection. Further, the inspection ought to be carried out solely by the experienced veterinarians. In order to protect the public against the danger of consuming meat of the diseased animal or unsound meat, the correct procedure would be to conduct a post-mortem inspection supplemented by the requisite microbiological test, before approving the meat for consumption. It is impossible to perform necessary tests unless facilities for laboratory examination are available. MoreOver these tests are very expensive, laborious, and time consuming. Routine tests take minimum 24 hours to get the results. In the absence of such information, it is inevitable that a very wide margin of safety must be extended to at least what are described as "border line" cases of septicaemia, inasmuch as practical experience has repeatedly shown that the carcass of an animal slaughtered while ill may not reveal all the classical lesions of septicaemia on post-mortem examination and in some cases may exhibit little but imperfect bleeding and a moderate degree of icterus.<br>
Generalized systemic affections, however, are in many cases associated with imperfect bleeding of the carcass and an alkalinity of the flesh, and these deleterious factors, even if salmonellae or other microbes are shown to be absent, may so lower the durability of the carcass as to warrant its total condemnation. The extent to which diseased animals constitute a danger as a source of food poisoning therefore depends largely on the efficiency with which meat inspection is carried out and the success achieved in<br>
preventing the flesh of such animals from reaching the market. As can be seen from the disclosure herein above, the cold slaughtered meat requires rigorous testing to ensure safe product to the consumer as compared to live slaughtered meat. This is more inevitable incase of the animals wherein death is due to disease more particularly infectious disease. This needs to differentiate first cold slaughtered meat from the live slaughtered meat so as to alarm for extensive testing towards safety in order to safe guard consumers health and prevent economic losses to industries engaged in institutional catering such as Army. Further it is imperative to develop a method that is simple can be performed easily, rapidly, even at remote places, without requiring skilled personnel or sophisticated infrastructure like laboratories with ultramodern equipments.<br>
It is well known that there is almost no bleeding in cold slaughtered meat. Thus its haemoglobin content is bound to be much higher than the live slaughtered meat. Haemoglobin content in typical adult mammalian muscle after rigor mortis is 0.04% (Lawrie R.A. Meat science, Pergamon Press Oxford, 1968). The present invention tries to utilize this information for developing a reagent strip to detect cold slaughtered meat. Moreover, detection of any component by means of test strips is ever increasing importance. This is because such methods are simple, economic, user friendly as do not require large space and critical process parameters, and help in rapid detection. The test strips are widely used for detection of blood or urine components for qualitative or semi quantitative detection for monitoring/diagnosing general status of the health. The test strips are also widely used for investigating quality of water, wastewater drinks and other liquids. However, no strips are available for investigating quality of solid material such as food, meat, vegetables, and fruits. Further, to the best of the knowledge of the inventor, no reagent strips are available for the detection of cold slaughtered meat. The present invention aims at developing reagent strip for detecting cold slaughtered meat so as to give signals for conducting further investigations to ensure safety prior to approve the consumption or using the meat for products/snacks preparation. The present invention relates to using non-fluorophore chromophore, malachite green. Malachite green forms a green coloured complex with oxidized haemoglobin present in ample in the cold slaughtered meat as no bleeding takes place in cold slaughtered meat. Further, it may be worthwhile to mention that the homogeneity of the reagent was maintained to the desired<br>
extent on the carrier to take care of complex nature of the reactants i.e. oxidized haemoglobin and reagent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>

STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a reagent strip for rapid detection of cold slaughtered meat comprising a chemically inert good quality absorbent carrier having homogeneously incorporated therein a reagent capable of reacting with the oxidized haemoglobin present in the sample to be tested.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention, a chemically inert good quality absorbent carrier may be such as absorbent paper with medium ash Whatman filter paper.<br>
The other embodiment of this invention, homogeneously incorporated reagent capable of reacting with the oxidized haemoglobin may be non-fluorophore chromophore malachite green. The malachite green incorporated when in acidic condition such as having pH between 3 to 7. Further, the reagent is inactive under storage.<br>
In accordance with the other aspect of this invention there is provided a process for preparing reagent strip for detection of cold slaughtered meat comprising of the following steps:<br>
(i)      preparing aqueous solution of a reagent capable of reacting with the    oxidized<br>
haemoglobin present in the sample,<br>
(ii) incorporating predetermined quantity of the said reagent in chemically inert good quality absorbent carrier by any known methods to form a reagent containing carrier, and<br>
(iii) drying the carrier as obtained in step (ii) to form a reagent carrier/strip capable of reacting with the predetermined chemical compound in a test material when the predetermined chemical compound in the test material establishes contact<br>
with the reagent contained in the dried reagent carrier/strip, followed by storing in total barrier packing material containers.<br>
A reagent capable of reacting with the oxidized haemoglobin may be such as non-fluorophore chromophore analytical grade malachite green procured from the reputed manufacturers used for aqueous solution, the solution thus prepared may be ranging from 0.1 to 2.0% by wt. and pH adjusted to 3 to 7.<br>
A chemically inert good quality absorbent carrier may be such as absorbent paper with medium ash such as Whatman filter paper optionally cut to desired size. The size is just for ease of handling and not critical for detection purposes. However, strips of 0.5 to 1.5 square cms are found convenient. The reagent may be incorporated in the carrier either prior to cutting to desired size or after cutting to desired size.<br>
Incorporation may be effected by any methods exemplified but not limiting to soaking dipping.<br>
Drying may be carried out at a temperature preferably below 70°C to ensure complete removal of moisture. Preferably the drying may be effected at a temperature between 40° to 70°C for 2 to 4 hours in hot air oven or under current of hot air. Any container or pouches that can ensure avoiding contact of atmospheric moisture may be used for storing the strips.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of this invention, there is provided a method for detection of cold slaughtered meat comprising of<br>
(a)	contacting the reagent strips as claimed herein-above with a small portion of test<br>
material in moist conditions,<br>
(b)	observing the colour change from blue to green.<br>
The amount of test sample may be in the range of 1 to 2 grams and the contacting may be effected for about 2 minutes.<br>
Details of operation for the detection of cold slaughtered meat are illustrated below. However this should construe the scope of the protection sought in this invention.<br>
1.	Reagent strips were transferred to vial preferably screw cap bottle to ensure<br>
oxygen free atmosphere.<br>
2.	Add about 10 ml of potable water.<br>
3.	Add piece of meat approximately weighing 1 to 2 gram, shake well.<br>
4.	Observe colour change.<br>
