"A MYCOPLASMA HYOPNEUMONIAE VACCINE COMPOSITION"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
26-10-2007 <br>
23 OCT 2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to a mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine, composition.<br>
Field of the Invention The present'invention'relates to methods for treating or preventing a disease or    5      disorder in an animal caused by infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo) by administering to the animal at approximately three (3) to ten (10)_days of age, a single dose of ah effective amount of a M. hyo vaccine.  The M. hyo vaccjpe can be-a-whole or partial cell inactivated or modified live preparation, a subunit vaccine, or a nucleic acid or DNA vaccine. The   M.   hyo  vaccine  administered   in   accordance with the present invenfion can be 10      synthetically or recombinant produced.<br>
Background of the Invention	~<br>
M. hyo is a bacterial pathogen that causes enzootic pneumonia in swine.    Enzootic pneumonia is a chronic disease that results in poor feed conversion, stunted growth 'and 15      predisposition to secondary pulmonary infections.    M. hyo is easily transmitted through<br>
respiratory tract secretionsand bu sow to piglet transmission and is highly prevent on pig<br>
farms.  Approximately 99% of US swine herds are infected, costing the swine industry about<br>
$300 million annually.		.<br>
The majority of known vaccines against M. hyo have been based on adjuvahfed<br>
20      inactivated whole cell preparations of M. hyo.  In addition, vaccines based upon immunogenic<br>
polypeptides or proteins may be synthesized or prepared by cloning  and recombinant<br>
expression of M. hyo genes.   M. hyo genes capable of expressing such polypeptides or<br>
proteins in vivo may also be used as vaccines.<br>
Examples of whole cell inactivated M.  hyo. vaccines include  RESPISURE and 25      STELLAMUNE, commercially available from Pfizer Inc., USA.<br>
In addition, several recombinant produced immunogenic polypeptides and proteins of M. hyo that may be useful as subunit vaccines have been described.International Patent Publication WO 96/28472 describes six protein antigen species of M. hyo at molecular weights of 46-48, 52-54, 60-64, 72-75, 90-94 and 110-114 kilodaltons, and discloses partial 30 protein sequences of the 52-54, 60-64 and 72-75 kilodalton antigens and the full length nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the 46-48 kilodalton antigen.<br>
The cloning of the gene encoding the M. hyo protein P46, i.e. p46, was also described by Futo et al. (1995; J. Bacteriol 177:1915-1917): The same group showed that the in vitro expressed gene product was useful in diagnosing antibody responses to M. hyo 35 infections without cross reactivity to other Mycoplasma species (Futo et al., 1995, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:680-683). The sequences and diagnostic uses of the p46 gene described by Futo et al. are further disclosed in European Patent Publication No. 0 475 185 A1.<br><br>
WO 03/003941<br><br>
PCT/IB02/02121<br><br>
Wise and Kim (1987, J. Bacteriol., 169:5546-5555) report that there are.four integral membrane protein species in M. hyo, named p70, p65 (P65, supra), p50 and p44, and that the latter three are modified by covalent lipid attachments and induce' a strong humoral immune response. The protective effects of the immune response were not investigated. 5 The gene encoding the P65 protein has been cloned, and its sequences and uses in vaccines and diagnostics are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,788,962.<br>
International Patent Publication WO 91/15593 describes five proteins of M. hyo of apparent molecular weights of 105, 90, 85, 70 and 43 kilodaltons.  A full length sequence of the gene encoding 85 kilodalton protein (protein C) was provided, as were partial nucleotide 10      sequences encoding the other four proteins.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,252,328 to Faulds discloses amino terminal; sequences of immunoreactive M. hyo proteins, the molecular weights of which are 36, 41, 44, 48, 64, 68, 74.5, 79, 88.5, 96 and 121 kilodaltons. Other proteins identified based on the electrophoretic mobilities but for which no protein sequences were disclosed had apparent molecular weights 15 of 22.5, 34 and 52 kilodaltons. While U.S. Patent No. 5,252,328 proposed the use of these proteins in vaccine formulations, no results of vaccine trials were reported.<br>
International Patent Publication WO 95/09870 discloses biochemical methods for the purification of M. hyo adhesins, the mycoplasmal integral membrane proteins responsible for adhesion to the cilia of the host's upper respiratory epithelium.  WO 95/09870 also proposes 20      assays and uses for these proteins, for example in vaccines and diagnostics.<br>
A research paper by King el al. (1997; Vaccine 15:25-35) disclosed Mhp1, a 124 kilodalton adhesin that is a strain variant of P97.<br>
A 94 kilodalton variant of P97 was identified by Wilton et al. (1998, Microbiology 144:1931-1943). Additionally, the p97 gene was shown to be part of an operon that also 25 encodes a second protein, termed P102, of a predicted molecular weight of approximately 102 kilodaltons (Hsu ei al., 1998, Gene 214:13-23). Minion and Hsu suggest the use of P102 in vaccines in the international patent publication WO 99/26664 but do not report vaccine trials.<br>
None of the known M. hyo vaccines have been described as effective in a single dose 30 treatment of swine at approximately 3 to 10 days of age. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need for multiple dosing and thereby significantly decrease the costs and labor associated . with the worldwide massive vaccination of swine herds. Thus, there is a need for an effective M. hyo vaccine that can be administered to swine in a single dose vaccination at from about 3 to about 10 days of age for protecting and preventing diseases or disorders caused by M. 35      hyo.<br><br>

Such protein purification can be accomplished by a variety of methods well known in the art. See, for example, the techniques described in "Methods In Enzymology", 1990, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, "Protein Purification: Principles and practice", 1982, 30      Springer-Verlag, New York.<br>
Purified M. hyo polypeptides and proteins and immunogenic fragments thereof can also be prepared using known synthetic methods.<br>
Vaccine Formulations<br>
35	Suitable   preparations   of   the   vaccines   used   in   the   present invention   include<br>
injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection, may also be prepared.  The preparation may also be<br><br>
WO 03/003941	PCT/IB02/02121<br><br>
emulsified.   The active immunogenic ingredients are often mixed with adjuvants which are pharmaceutical acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient.<br>
The polypeptides may be formulated into the vaccine as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with free amino 5 groups of the peptide) and which are formed with inorganic acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or organic acids such as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, maleic, and the like. Salts formed with free carboxyl groups may also be derived from inorganic bases, such as, for example, sodium potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, hisiidine, procaine 10      and the like.<br>
The vaccine formulations  used  in  the  present  invention comprise  an effective<br>
immunizing amount of the M. hyo immunogen and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Vaccine preparations comprise an effective immunizing amount of one or more antigens and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known<br>
15      in the art and include but are not limited to saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol,<br>
sterile  isotonic aqueous buffer,  and  combinations  thereof.     One  example  of such  an<br>
acceptable carrier is a physiologically balanced culture medium containing one or more<br>
stabilizing  agents  such as stabilized,  hydrolyzed  proteins,  lactose, etc.    The carrier is<br>
preferably sterile. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.<br>
20	Use of purified antigens as vaccine preparations can be carried out by standard<br>
methods.     For example, the purified  protein(s) should  be  adjusted  to  an  appropriate<br>
concentration, formulated with any suitable vaccine adjuvant and packaged for use..    .<br>
Suitable adjuvants may include, but are not limited to: mineral gels, e.g., aluminum hydroxide;<br>
surface  active substances such  as  lysolecithin;  glycosides,  e.g.,  saponin and saponin<br>
25      derivatives   such  as  Quil A  or  GPI-0100;  cationic  surfactants,   e.g.   DDA  (quaternary<br>
hydrocarbon  ammonium halogenides,  pluronic polyols;  polyanions  and  polyatomic  ions;<br>
polyacrylic acids, non-ionic block polymers, e.g., Pluronic F-127 (B.A.S.F., USA); Avridine and<br>
Rantidine; peptides; recombinant mutant labile toxins, e.g., leukotoxin (rmLT) or cholera toxin<br>
(CT); chemically bound or close proximity molecular transporters; mineral oils, e.g. Montanide<br>
30       ISA-50 (Seppic, Paris, France), carbopol, Amphigen (Hydronics, USA), Omaha, NE. USA,<br>
Alhydrogel, (Superfos Biosector, Frederikssund, Denmark) oil emulsions, e.g. an emulsion of<br>
mineral oil such as BayolF/Arlacel A and water, or an emulsion of vegetable oil, water and an<br>
emulsifier such as lecithin; alum,  MDP,   N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine  (thr-<br>
MDP),	N-acetyJ-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine,	N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-<br>
35      isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1'-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine; cholesterol cytokines and combinations of adjuvants. Polyatomic ions can also function as dispersing, thickening and anticaking agents which allow the vaccine to be resuspended as a<br><br>
WO 03/003941	PCT/IB02/02121<br>
mondisperse suspension after a prolonger period of settling. The adjuvant combinations may be presented in aqueous, encapsulated (controlled or delayed release) or microencapsulated forms<br>
The immunogen may also be incorporated into liposomes, or conjugated to 5 polysaccharides and/or other polymers for use in a vaccine formulation In instances where the recombinant antigen is a hapten, i.e., a molecule that is antigenic in that it can react selectively with cognate antibodies, but not immunogenic in that it cannot elicit an immune response, the hapten may be covalently bound to a carrier or immunogenic molecule; for, instance, a large protein such as serum albumin will confer immunogenicity to the hapten 10      coupled to it. The hapfen-carrier may be formulated for use as a vaccine.<br>
Gene and Nucleic Acid Vaccines The method of the present invention can be practiced using M. hyo genes or nucleic acids encoding for immunogenic proteins, polypeptides and immunogenic fragments of such 15      proteins and polypeptides.

Dosing and Modes of Administration		<br>
According to the present invention, a single dose of an effective amount of a M. hyo<br>
vaccine administered to swine of approximately 3 to 10 days of age provides effective<br>
25      immunity against a later challenge of M. hyo.    Preferably, the M. hyo vaccine is administered<br>
at about six to about eight days of age.   Most preferably, the M. hyo vaccine is administered<br>
at about seven days of age.<br>
The amount of a M. hyo bacterin vaccine effective in one dose administration contains about 1x106to about 5x1010 color changing units (CCU) per dose.  Preferably, a M. 30      hyo bacterin vaccine that provides effective immunity in a single dose contains about 1x108 to 5x101DCCU/dose and more preferably, about 5x108 to 5x1010CCU/dose.<br>
According to the present invention, when the preferred bacterin product RESPISURE<br>
- 1 is administered, the amount of RESPISURE - 1 for one dose administration is about 0.5 to<br>
about 3.0 ml, preferably about 1.5 ml to about 2.5 ml, and more preferably, about 2 ml.<br>

The  present vaccination  methods  provide  protective  immunity for  both  piglets 15      seropositive and piglets seronegative for M. hyo.   Seropositive piglets refer to those piglets which have in the serum, antibodies against M. hyo.    Seronegative piglets refer to those piglets which do not have in the serum, detectable levels of antibodies against M. hyo.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated, but not limited by the following examples.<br>
20	Example 1<br>
Preparation of a M. hyo bacterin<br>
BinaryEthylenelmine (BEI) is used for inactivation of M. hyo strain NL1042.<br>
At the end of the growth period, the pH of the culture was raised to 7.8 ± 0.2, and the<br>
pH was maintained within this range for at least one hour.   At this time, a filter sterilized<br>
25      aqueous   solution   of   2-BromoEthylAminehydrobromide   (BEA)   was   added   to   a   final<br>
concentration of approximately 4.0 mM.    In the presence of the elevated pH, the BEA is<br>
chemically changed to BEI. The culture was incubated at 37 ± 2°C with constant agitation for<br>
at least 24 hours.	<br>
After the 24 hours incubation, a filter sterilized aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate 30      was added to a final concentration of approximately 4 mM to neutralize excess BEI.   The culture was incubated at 37 ± 2°C with constant agitation for an additional 24 hours.<br>
Following   inactivation,   but   prior   to   neutralization   with   sodium   thiosulfate,   a<br>
representative sample was taken and tested for completion of inactivation.   Fresh medium<br>
containing 0.0026% phenol red was inoculated with a 5-20% inoculum and incubated at 37 ±<br>
35      2°C for at least one week prior to examination for a color change, which is indicative of failure<br>
to inactivate.   Bulk samples were tested for sterility in thioglycollate broth at 37 ± 2°C, and<br><br>

15<br><br>
trypticase soy broth at room temperature.   The inactivated culture may be transferred into sterile storage vessels and stored at 2-8°C until assembled.<br>
Potency was determined by an in vitro serological assay to quantitiate antigen in the final container. The potency of the vaccines used in the efficacy study determines the minimum potency that must be preseht in the vaccine at the date of expiration.<br>
; Bulk or final container samples of completed product of each serial or first subserial was tested for M. hyo as follows.<br>
The bacterin was stored at -50C in 100 ml vials. The vials were thawed and sub-aliquots of 15 mL are stored at 5 +/- 2C until used.<br>
To test the potency of an assembled serial, a sample of the serial was compared to a reference, and RP units are determined for the serial. A serial or subserial should p'referably contain at least 6.33 RP at the initiation of dating, and at least 5.06 RP throughout dating.<br>
RP refers to relative potency. The RP's can be determined by a relative antigen quantitation as compared to a reference vaccine. In this case the reference has an RP by definition = 1.0. The single dose product of the present invention preferably has a RP of 6.33, that is 6.33 times the reference.<br>
Merthiolate is added as a preservative in a final concentration not to exceed 0.0f (w/v). •<br>
10% Ethylene-Diamine Tetra Acetic acid (EDTA, Disodium or tetrasodium salt) solution is added as preservative in a final concentration of approximately 0.07% (w/v).<br><br>

Example 2 Animals<br>
Pigs approximately one week of age were selected for vaccination. Serological status to M. hyo were assessed in an ELISA assay. Pigs with an ELISA value.
M. hyo bacterin RESPISURE -1 (.Efizer-lnc), was used to vaccinate pigs. The potency of the vaccine was determined prior to use by relative antigen quantitation as 10      compared to a reference M. hyo bacterin. The reference vaccine (RP = 1.0) contained about 8000 units of antigen (about 1 to 2 x 108 CCU of viable cells harvested prior to inactivation) per dose, determined by a solid phase immunoassay which measured the'quantity of M. hyo antigen in the vaccine.<br>
The same liquid adjuvant (AMPHIGEN) used in formulating RESPISURE -1 was 15      used as the placebo (i.e., without bacterial cells). Challenge Inoculum<br>
The challenge inoculum, was provided as 10 ml aliquots of lung homogenate, frozen at -70°C, and was identified as a derivative of M. hyo strain 11 (L1 36). The inoculum was thawed and then diluted in Friis Mycoplasma Broth to achieve a 1:25 dilution, and kept 20 on ice until administered. Each pig received a 5 ml intranasal dose (2.5ml per nostril) of the 1:25 suspension on days specified in each of the following examples. On each day of challenge, an aliquot of the lung inoculum was cultured to confirm the absence of bacterial contamination. A second aliquot was back titrated on each of the 3 days, the results indicated that the inoculum contained approximately 106-107 color changing units (CCU)/ml of M. hyo. 25      Experimental Procedure<br>
Pigs were identified with ear tags while they were still on the sow [Day (-1)]. The pigs were allotted to pens and treatment groups according to a generalized random block design. Pigs were blocked based on litter and post-weaning pen.<br>
On Day 0, pigs were vaccinated with either a 2 ml intramuscular dose of M. hyo 30      bacterin RESPISURE - 1 (Pfizer Inc.), or with a 2 ml intramuscular dose of placebo. Each pig received a 5 ml intranasal dose of the 1:25 suspension of the challenge inoculum on days specified in each of the following examples. All pigs were monitored and checked for signs of clinical disease daily.<br>
At a specified time after the first day of challenge, all pigs were euthanized and 35      necropsied. The lungs were removed and evaluated. The post-mortem examination included an estimate of the extent of pathology associated with mycoplasmal respiratory disease.<br><br>
WO 03/(103941<br><br>
PCT/IB02/02121<br><br>
Each lung lobe was examined, and lesions were sketched to estimate the percent involvement of each lobe. The degree of gross lesions present was recorded. Data Analysis<br>
Efficacy was evaluated based on percent of lung lesions typical of a M. hyo 5      infection. Pigs in a treatment group'(vaccinates) were determined to have a percentage of . • total lung with lesions that was significantly (P
"' Percent gross involvement per each lung lobe was weighted using the following<br>
ratios of individual lung lobes to total lung mass: left cranial 10%, left middle 10%, left caudal<br>
10      25%. right cranial; 10%, right middle 10%, right caudal 25%, and accessory 10%.    The<br>
weighted lung lobe values were then summed across lobes to yield the Percentage of Total<br>
Lung with Lesions (Pointon et al., 1992).<br>
Example 3 Protection   against  challenge  with  virulent   M.   hyo  was  evaluated   in .pigs 15      serologically positive for M. hyo using a single dose of M. hyo.baclerin RESPISURE - 1 (Pfizer Inc), administered to pigs at 3 to 8 days of age.<br>
Five replicate potency assays for RESPISURE - 1 were conducted at or around<br>
the time of vaccination.    The relative potency (RP) was determined by relative antigen<br>
quantitation as compared to a reference vaccine. The reference vaccine, having a RP = 1.0,<br>
20      contained about 8000 units of M. hyo antigen.   The RPs from these five assays were 5.42,<br>
3.96, 4.71, 5.49 and 4.36, respectively.<br>
On Day 0, pigs in Treatment Group T02 (see Table 1 below) were vaccinated<br>
with a 2 ml intramuscular dose of M. hyo bacterin RESPISURE - 1 (Pfizer Inc.). Pigs in<br>
Group T01 were vaccinated intramuscularly with 2 ml of a placebo. Each pig received a 5 ml<br>
25 intranasal dose of the 1:25 suspension of the challenge inoculum on Days 178,179 and 180.<br>
On each of the 3 days, an aliquot of the challenge material was cultured at time of inoculation<br>
to confirm the absence of bacterial contamination. A second aliquot was back-titrated to<br>
confirm the challenge stock contained approximately 107 CCU/mL of M. hyo. All pigs were<br>
monitored and checked for signs of clinical disease daily.<br>
30	Thirty days after the first day of challenge, all pigs were euthanized and<br>
necropsied. The lungs were removed and evaluated. The post-mortem examination included an estimate of the extent of pathology associated with mycoplasmal respiratory disease. Each lung lobe was examined, and lesions were sketched to estimate the percent involvement of each lobe. The degree of gross lesions present was recorded<br><br>
