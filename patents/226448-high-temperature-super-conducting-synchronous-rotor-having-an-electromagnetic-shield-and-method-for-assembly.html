				<td>HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPER-CONDUCTING SYNCHRONOUS ROTOR<br>
HAVING AN ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELD AND METHOD FOR ASSEMBLY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a super-conductive coil in a synchronous<br>
rotating machine. More particularly, the present invention relates to an<br>
electromagnetic shield for a rotor having super-conducting field windings.<br>
Synchronous electrical machines having field coil windings include, but are not<br>
limited to, rotary generators, rotary motors, and linear motors. These machines<br>
generally comprise a stator and rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor<br>
may include a multi-pole rotor core and one or more coil windings mounted on the<br>
rotor core. The rotor cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material, such<br>
as an iron-core rotor.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings (although<br>
low by conventional measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial heating of the<br>
rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine. Recently, super-<br>
conducting (SC) coil windings have been developed for rotors. SC windings have<br>
effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
Known super-conductive rotors employ air-core designs, with no iron in the rotor, to<br>
achieve air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher. These high air-gap magnetic<br>
fields yield increased power densities of the electrical machine, and result in<br>
significant reduction in weight and size of the machine. Air-core super-conductive<br>
rotors require large amounts of super-conducting wire. The large amounts of SC wire<br>
add to the number of coils required, the complexity of the coil supports, and the cost<br>
of the SC coil windings and rotor.<br><br>
High temperature SC coil field windings are formed of super-conducting materials<br>
that are brittle, and must be cooled to a temperature at or below a critical temperature,<br>
e.g., 27°K, to achieve and maintain super-conductivity. The SC windings may be<br>
formed of a high temperature super-conducting material, such as a BSCCO<br>
(BixSrxCaxCuxOx) based conductor.<br>
Super-conducting coils have been cooled by liquid helium. After passing through the<br>
windings of the rotor, the hot, used helium is returned as room-temperature gaseous<br>
helium. Using liquid helium for cryogenic cooling requires continuous reliquefaction<br>
of the returned, room-temperature gaseous helium, and such reliquefaction poses<br>
significant reliability problems and requires significant auxiliary power.<br>
Prior SC coil cooling techniques include cooling an epoxy-impregnated SC coil<br>
through a solid conduction path from a cryocooler. Alternatively, cooling tubes in the<br>
rotor may convey a liquid and/or gaseous cryogen to a porous SC coil winding that is<br>
immersed in the flow of the liquid and/or gaseous cryogen. However, immersion<br>
cooling requires the entire field winding and rotor structure to be at cryogenic<br>
temperature, as a result no iron can be used in the rotor magnetic circuit because of<br>
the brittle nature of iron at cryogenic temperatures.<br>
What is needed is a super-conducting field winding assemblage for an electrical<br>
machine that does not have the disadvantages of the air-core and liquid-cooled super-<br>
conducting field winding assemblages of, for example, known super-conductive<br>
rotors.<br>
In addition, high temperature super-conducting (HTS) coils are sensitive to<br>
degradation from high bending and tensile strains. These coils must undergo<br>
substantial centrifugal forces that stress and strain the coil windings. Normal<br>
operation of electrical machines involves thousands of start up and shut down cycles<br>
over the course of several years that result in low cycle fatigue loading of the rotor.<br>
Furthermore, the HTS rotor winding should be capable of withstanding 25% over-<br>
speed operation during rotor balancing procedures at ambient temperature and<br>
notwithstanding occasional over-speed conditions at cryogenic temperatures during<br><br>
power generation operation. These over-speed conditions substantially increase the<br>
centrifugal force loading on the windings over normal operating conditions.<br>
SC coils used as the HTS rotor field winding of an electrical machine are subjected to<br>
stresses and strains during cool-down and normal operation. They are subjected to<br>
centrifugal loading, torque transmission, and transient fault conditions. To withstand<br>
the forces, stresses, strains and cyclical loading, the SC coils should be properly<br>
supported in the rotor by a coil support system. These support systems hold the SC<br>
coil(s) in the HTS rotor and secure the coils against the tremendous centrifugal forces<br>
due to the rotation of the rotor. Moreover, the coil support system protects the SC<br>
coils, and ensures that the coils do not prematurely crack, fatigue or otherwise break.<br>
Developing support systems for HTS coil has been a difficult challenge in adapting<br>
SC coils to HTS rotors. Examples of coil support systems for HTS rotors that have<br>
previously been proposed are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 5.548.168: 5.532.663:<br>
5.672.921: 5.777.420; 6,169.353, and 6,066,906. However, these coil support<br>
systems suffer various problems, such as being expensive, complex and requiring an<br>
excessive number of components. There is a long-felt need for a HTS rotor having a<br>
coil support system for a SC coil. The need also exists for a coil support system made<br>
with low cost and easy to fabricate components.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Structural supports for the HTS field coil windings has been one of the primary<br>
challenges to incorporating SC coils into rotors. The structure must support the SC<br>
coil winding without conducting substantial heat into the winding. The structure of<br>
the coil support has been minimized so as to reduce the mass that conducts heat from<br>
the rotor core into the cooled SC windings. However, minimizing the coil supports<br>
also limits the level of forces that can be withstood by the supports. If the forces that<br>
act on the rotor exceed the force carrying ability of the coil supports, then there is a<br>
substantial risk that the coil support will fail or that the coil windings will be<br>
damaged.<br><br>
A potential source of forces that act on the rotor is torque due to grid faults. A High<br>
Temperature Super-Conducting (HTS) generator has a field winding SC coil is<br>
susceptible to electrical grid faults. A grid fault is a current spike in the power system<br>
grid to which is coupled the stator of the machine. Under grid fault conditions<br>
excessive current flows in the stator. This current causes an electrical disturbance in<br>
the stator winding that induces a strong transient magnetic flux into the rotor field<br>
winding coils.<br>
The potential penetration of a transient magnetic field into the rotor field winding coil<br>
creates significant torque forces on the rotor coil winding and induces hysteresis and<br>
eddy current heating (alternating current loses) in the super-conducting field winding<br>
that my result in loss of super-conductivity. In addition, reducing these extraneous<br>
magnetic field penetrations will reduce alternating current (AC) loses in the super-<br>
conductor and preserve the super-conducting state of the rotor field winding.<br>
Minimizing the forces that act on a rotor allows for reduction in the structure of the<br>
coil support system. Reducing the rotor torque due to grid faults and other<br>
extraordinary variations in the electromagnetic field surrounding the rotor allows the<br>
coil support structures to be minimized.<br>
Shielding the rotor prevents magnetic flux from the stator from interfering with the<br>
rotor. If a rotor field winding coil is not well shielded, the coil support must be<br>
reinforced to support the fault torque. An electromagnetic (EM) shield prevents stator<br>
magnetic flux from penetrating the rotor, which is more important for a super-<br>
conducting machine than a conventional machine.<br>
The EM shield may cover nearly the entire surface of the rotor core. A cylindrical<br>
shield shape is useful for providing EM protection to the rotor. The EM shield may<br>
also served as the vacuum boundary for the SC coils. This boundary establishes a<br>
vacuum around the SC coil winding. The EM shield may be made of highly electrical<br>
conducted material, such as copper or aluminum.<br>
The HTS rotor may be for a synchronous machine originally designed to include SC<br>
coils. Alternatively, the HTS rotor may replace a copper coil rotor in an existing<br><br>
electrical machine, such as in a conventional generator. The rotor and its SC coils are<br>
described here in the context of a generator, but the HTS coil rotor is also suitable for<br>
use in other synchronous machines.<br>
The coil support system is useful in integrating the coil support system with the coil<br>
and rotor. In addition, the coil support system facilitates easy pre-assembly of the coil<br>
support system, coil and rotor core prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-assembly<br>
reduces coil and rotor assembly time, improves coil support quality, and reduces coil<br>
assembly variations.<br>
In a first embodiment, the invention is a rotor in a synchronous machine comprising: a<br>
rotor core; a super-conducting coil winding extending around at least a portion of the<br>
rotor core, said coil winding having a pair of side sections on opposite sides of said<br>
rotor core; and a conductive shield around the rotor core and covering said coil<br>
winding.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a method for shielding a super-conducting<br>
coil winding on a rotor core of a synchronous machine comprising the steps of:<br>
assembling the coil winding and rotor core; attaching ends of the core to collars of<br>
end shafts coaxially aligned with the core, and installing a conductive shield around<br>
the rotor core, wherein the shield overlaps each of the collars.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a rotor for a synchronous machine<br>
comprising: a rotor core having a conduit orthogonal to a longitudinal axis of the<br>
rotor; a race-track super-conducting (SC) coil winding in a planar race-track shape<br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rotor; a tension rod inside the conduit of the<br>
core; a housing coupling the coil winding to the tension rod, and a electromagnetic<br>
shield around the rotor core.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 10 having a stator 12<br>
and a rotor 14. The rotor includes field winding coils that fit inside the cylindrical<br>
rotor vacuum cavity 16 of the stator. The rotor fits inside the rotor vacuum cavity of<br>
the stator. As the rotor turns within the stator, a magnetic field 18 (illustrated by<br>
dotted lines) generated by the rotor and rotor coils moves/rotates through the stator<br>
and creates an electrical current in the windings of the stator coils 19. This current is<br>
output by the generator as electrical power.<br>
The rotor 14 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 20 and a generally solid<br>
rotor core 22. The solid core 22 has high magnetic permeability, and is usually made<br>
of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron. In a low power density super-conducting<br>
machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the magnetomotive force (MMF),<br>
and, thus, minimize the amount of super-conducting (SC) coil wire needed for the coil<br>
winding. For example, the solid iron- rotor core may be magnetically saturated at an<br>
air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
The rotor 14 supports at least one longitudinally-extending, racetrack-shaped, high-<br>
temperature super-conducting (HTS) coil winding 34 (See Fig. 2). The HTS coil<br>
winding may be alternatively a saddle-shape or have some other shape that is suitable<br>
for a particular HTS rotor design. A coil support system is disclosed here for a race-<br><br>
track SC coil winding. The coil support system may be adapted for coil<br>
configurations other than a race-track coil mounted on a solid rotor core.<br>
The rotor includes a pair of end shafts 24, 30 that bracket the core 22 and are<br>
supported by bearings 25. The collector end shaft 24 may include collector rings 78<br>
for electrically connecting to the rotating SC coil winding. The collector end shaft<br>
also has a cryogen transfer coupling 26 to a source of cryogenic cooling fluid used to<br>
cool the SC coil windings in the rotor The cryogen transfer coupling 26 includes a<br>
stationary segment coupled to a source of cryogen cooling fluid and a rotating<br>
segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS coil. The drive end shaft 30 may be<br>
driven by a power turbine via drive coupling 32.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary HTS race-track field coil winding 34. The SC field<br>
winding coils 34 of the rotor includes a high temperature super-conducting (SC) coil<br>
36. Each SC coil includes a high temperature super-conducting conductor, such as a<br>
BSCCO (BixSrxCaxCuxOx) conductor wires laminated in a solid epoxy impregnated<br>
winding composite. For example, a series of BSCCO 2223 wires may be laminated,<br>
bonded together and wound into a solid epoxy impregnated coil.<br>
SC wire is brittle and easy to be damaged. The SC coil is typically layer wound SC<br>
tape that is epoxy impregnated. The SC tape is wrapped in a precision coil form to<br>
attain close dimensional tolerances. The tape is wound around in a helix to form the<br>
race-track SC coil 36.<br>
The dimensions of the race-track coil are dependent on the dimensions of the rotor<br>
core. Generally, each race-track SC coil encircles the magnetic poles of the rotor<br>
core, and is parallel to the rotor axis. The coil windings are continuous around the<br>
racetrack. The SC coils form a resistance free electrical current path around the rotor<br>
core and between the magnetic poles of the core. The coil has electrical contacts 79<br>
that electrically connect the coil to the collector 78.<br>
Fluid passages 38 for cryogenic cooling fluid are included in the coil winding 34.<br>
These passages may extend around an outside edge of the SC coil 36. The<br>
passageways provide cryogenic cooling fluid to the coil and remove heat from the<br><br>
coil. The cooling fluid maintains the low temperatures, e.g., 27° K, in the SC coil<br>
winding needed to promote super-conducting conditions, including the absence of<br>
electrical resistance in the coil. The cooling passages have input and output fluid<br>
ports 39, 41 at one end of the rotor core. These fluid (gas) ports 39, 41 connect the<br>
cooling passages 38 on the SC coil to the cryogen transfer coupling 26.<br>
Each HIS race-track coil winding 34 has a pair of generally straight side portions 40<br>
parallel to a rotor axis 20, and a pair of end portions 54 that are perpendicular to the<br>
rotor axis. The side portions of the coil are subjected to the greatest centrifugal<br>
stresses. Accordingly, the side portions are supported by a coil support system that<br>
counteract the centrifugal forces that act on the coil.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an exploded view of a rotor core 22 and coil support system for a<br>
high temperature super-conducting coil. The support system includes tension rods 42<br>
connected to U-shaped channel housings. The housings hold and support the side<br>
portions 40 of the coil winding 34 in the rotor. While one tension rod and channel<br>
housing is shown in FIGURE 3, the coil support system will generally include a series<br>
of tension rods that each have coil support housings 44 at both ends of the rod. The<br>
tension rods and channel housings prevent damage to the coil winding during rotor<br>
operation, support the coil winding with respect to centrifugal and other forces, and<br>
provide a protective shield for the coil winding.<br>
The principal loading of the HTS coil winding 34 in an iron core rotor is from<br>
centrifugal acceleration during rotor rotation. An effective coil structural support is<br>
needed to counteract the centrifugal forces. The coil support is needed especially<br>
along the side sections 40 of the coil that experience the most centrifugal acceleration.<br>
To support the side sections of the coil, the tension rods 42 span between the sections<br>
of the coil and attach to the housings 44 that grasp opposite side sections of the coil.<br>
The tension rods extend through conduits 46, e.g., apertures, in the rotor core so that<br>
the rods may span between side sections of the same coil or between adjacent coils.<br>
The conduits 46 are generally cylindrical passages in the rotor core having a straight<br>
axis. The diameter of the conduits is substantially constant, except at their ends near<br><br>
the recessed surfaces of the rotor. At their ends, the conduits may expand to a larger<br>
diameter to accommodate a non-conducting cylindrical tube 52 that provides slidable<br>
bearing surface and thermal isolation between the rotor core and the tension rod.<br>
The axes of the conduits 46 are generally in a plane defined by the race-track coil. In<br>
addition, the axes of the conduits are perpendicular to the side sections of the coil to<br>
which are connected the tension rods that extends through the conduits. Moreover,<br>
the conduits are orthogonal to and intersect the rotor axis, in the embodiment shown<br>
here. The number of conduits and the location of the conduits will depend on the<br>
location of the HTS coils and the number of coil housings (see Figures 3 and 4)<br>
needed to support the side sections of the coils.<br>
The tension rods support the coil especially well with respect to centrifugal forces as<br>
the rods extend substantially radially between the sides of the coil winding. Each<br>
tension rod is a shaft with continuity along the longitudinal direction of the rod and in<br>
the plane of the race-track coil. The. longitudinal continuity of the tension rods<br>
provides lateral stiffness to the coils which provides rotor dynamics benefits.<br>
Moreover, the lateral stiffness permits integrating the coil support with the coils so<br>
that the coil can be assembled with the coil support prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-<br>
assembly of the coil and coil support reduces production cycle, improves coil support<br>
quality, and reduces coil assembly variations. The race-track coil is supported by an<br>
array of tension members that span the long sides of the coil. The tension rod coil<br>
support members are pre-assembled to coil.<br>
The HTS coil winding and structural support components are at cryogenic<br>
temperature. In contrast, the rotor core is at ambient "hot" temperature. The coil<br>
supports are potential sources of thermal conduction that would allow heat to reach<br>
the HTS coils from the rotor core. The rotor becomes hot during operation. As the<br>
coils are to be held in super-cooled conditions, heat conduction into the coils is to be<br>
avoided. The rods extend through apertures, e.g., conduits, in the rotor but are not in<br>
contact with the rotor. This lack of contact avoids the conduction of heat from the<br>
rotor to the tension rods and coils.<br><br>
To reduce the heat leaking away from the coil, the coil support is minimized to reduce<br>
the thermal conduction through support from heat sources such as the rotor core.<br>
There are generally two categories of support for super-conducting winding: (i)<br>
"warm" supports and (ii) "cold" supports. In a warm support, the supporting<br>
structures are thermally isolated from the cooled SC windings. With warm supports,<br>
most of the mechanical load of a super-conducting (SC) coil is supported by structural<br>
members spanning from cold to warm members.<br>
In a cold support system, the support system is at or near the cold cryogenic<br>
temperature of the SC coils. In cold supports, most of the mechanical toad of a SC<br>
coil is supported by structural members which are at or near a cryogenic temperature.<br>
The exemplary coil support system disclosed here is a cold support in that the tension<br>
rods and associated housings that couple the tension rods to the SC coil windings are<br>
maintained at or near a cryogenic temperature. Because the supporting members are<br>
cold, these members are thermally isolated, e.g., by the non-contact conduits through<br>
the rotor core, from other "hot" components of the rotor.<br>
An individual support member consists of a tension rod 42 (which may be a bar and a<br>
pair of bolts at either end of the bar), a coil housing 44, and a dowel pin 80 that<br>
connects the housing to the end of the tension rod. Each housing 44 is a U-shaped<br>
bracket having legs that connect to a tension rod and a channel to receive the coil<br>
winding 34. The U-shaped channel housing allows for the precise and convenient<br>
assembly of the support system for the coil. A series of coil housings may be<br>
positioned end-to-end along the side of the coil winding. The coil housings<br>
collectively distribute the forces that act on the coil, e.g., centrifugal forces, over<br>
substantially the entire side sections 40 of each coil.<br>
The coil housings 44 prevent the side sections 40 of the coils from excessive flexing<br>
and bending due to centrifugal forces. The coil supports do not restrict the coils from<br>
longitudinal thermal expansion and contraction that occur during normal start/stop<br>
operation of the gas turbine. In particular, thermal expansion is primarily directed<br>
along the length of the side sections. Thus, the side sections of the coil slide slightly<br>
longitudinally with respect to the channel housing and tension rods.<br><br>
The transfer of the centrifugal load from the coil structure to a support rod is through<br>
the coil housing that fits around the coil outside surface and side straight sections, and<br>
is doweled by pins 80 to a wide diameter end of the tension rod 42. The U-shaped<br>
housings 44 are formed of a light, high strength material mat is ductile at cryogenic<br>
temperatures. Typical materials for channel housing are aluminum, Inconel, or<br>
titanium alloys, which are non-magnetic. The shape of the U-shaped housing may be<br>
optimized for low weight and strength.<br>
The dowel pin 80 extends through apertures in the channel housing and tension rod.<br>
The dowel may be hollow for low weight. Locking nuts (not shown) are threaded or<br>
attached at the ends of the dowel pin to secure the U-shaped housing and prevent the<br>
sides of the housing from spreading apart under load The dowel pin can be made of<br>
high strength Inconel or titanium alloys. The tension rods are made with larger<br>
diameter ends (not shown) that are machined with two flats (not shown) at their ends<br>
to fit the U-shaped housing and coil width. The flat ends of the tension rods abut the<br>
inside surface of the HTS coils, when the rod, coil and housing are assembled<br>
together This assembly reduces the stress concentration at the hole in the tension rod<br>
that receives the dowel.<br>
The coil support system of tension rods 42, coil housings 44 and split-clamp 58 may<br>
be assembled with the HTS coil windings 34 as both are mounted on the rotor core<br>
22. The tension rods, housings and clamp provide a fairly rigid structure for<br>
supporting the coil windings and holding the coil windings in place with respect to the<br>
rotor core.<br>
Each tension rod 42 extends through the rotor core, and may extend orthogonally<br>
through the axis 20 of the rotor. Conduits 46 through the rotor core provide a passage<br>
through which extend the tension rods. The diameter of the conduits is sufficiently<br>
large to avoid having the hot rotor walls of the conduits be in contact with the cold<br>
tension rods. The avoidance of contact improves the thermal isolation between the<br>
tension rods and the rotor core.<br><br>
The rotor core 22 is typically made of magnetic material such as iron, while the rotor<br>
end shafts are typically made of non-magnetic material such as stainless steel. The<br>
rotor core and end shafts are typically discrete components that are assembled and<br>
securely joined together by either bolting or welding.<br>
The iron rotor core 22 has a generally cylindrical shape 50 suitable for rotation within<br>
the rotor cavity 16 of the stator 12. To receive the coil winding, the rotor core has<br>
recessed surfaces 48, such as flat or triangular regions or slots. These surfaces 48 are<br>
formed in the curved surface of the cylindrical core and extending longitudinally<br>
across the rotor core. The coil winding 34 is mounted on the rotor adjacent the<br>
recessed areas 48. The coils generally extend longitudinally along an outer surface of<br>
the recessed area and around the ends of the rotor core. The recessed surfaces 48 of<br>
the rotor core receive the coil winding. The shape of the recessed area conforms to<br>
the coil winding. For example, if the coil winding has a saddle-shape or some other<br>
shape, the recess(es) in the rotor core would be configured to receive the shape of the<br>
winding.<br>
The recessed surfaces 48 receive the coil winding such that the outer-surface of the<br>
coil winding extend to substantially an envelope defined by the rotation of the rotor.<br>
The outer curved surfaces 50 of the rotor core when rotated define a cylindrical<br>
envelope. This rotation envelope of the rotor has substantially the same diameter as<br>
the rotor cavity 16 (see Fig. 1) in the stator.<br>
The gap between the rotor envelope and stator cavity 16 is a relatively-small<br>
clearance, as required for forced flow ventilation cooling of the stator only, since the<br>
rotor requires no ventilation cooling. It is desirable to minimize the clearance<br>
between the rotor and stator so as to increase the electromagnetic coupling between<br>
the rotor coil windings and the stator windings. Moreover, the rotor coil winding is<br>
preferably positioned such that it extends to the envelope formed by the rotor and,<br>
thus, is separated from the stator by only the clearance gap between the rotor and<br>
stator.<br><br>
The end sections 54 of the coil winding 34 are adjacent opposite ends 56 of the rotor<br>
core. A split-clamp 58 holds each of the end sections of the coil windings in the rotor.<br>
The split clamp at each coil end 54 includes a pair of opposite plates 60 between<br>
which is sandwiched the coil winding 34. The surface of the clamp plates includes<br>
channels (not shown) to receive the coil winding and electrical connections 79 to the<br>
winding.<br>
The split clamp 58 may be formed of a non-magnetic material, such as aluminum or<br>
Inconel alloys. The same or similar non-magnetic materials may be used to form the<br>
tension rods, coil housings and other portions of the coil support system. The coil<br>
support system is preferably non-magnetic so as to preserve ductility at cryogenic<br>
temperatures, since ferromagnetic materials become brittle at temperatures below the<br>
Curie transition temperature and cannot be used as load carrying structures.<br>
The split clamp 58 is surrounded by, but is not in contact with collar 62. There is a<br>
collar 62 at each end of the rotor core 22, although only one collar is shown in Figure<br>
3. The collar is a thick disk of non-magnetic material, such as stainless steel, the<br>
same as or similar to the material, that forms the rotor shafts. Indeed, the collar is part<br>
of the rotor shaft. The collar has a slot 64 orthogonal to the rotor axis and sufficiently<br>
wide to receive and clear the split clamp 58. The hot side-walls 66 of the slot collar<br>
are spaced apart from the cold split clamp so they do not come in contact with each<br>
other.<br>
The collar 62 may include a recessed disk area 68 (which is bisected by the slot 64) to<br>
receive a raised disk region 70 of the rotor core (see opposite side of rotor core for<br>
raised disk region to be inserted in opposite collar). The insertion of the raised disk<br>
region 70 on the end of the rotor core into the recessed disk 68 provides support to the<br>
rotor core in the collar, and assists in aligning the rotor core and collars. In addition,<br>
the collar may have a circular array of bolt holes 72 extending longitudinally through<br>
the collar and around the rim of the collar. These bolt holes correspond to matching<br>
threaded bolt holes 74 that extend partially through the rotor core. Threaded bolts 75<br>
(see Fig. 5) extend through these longitudinal bolt holes 72, 74 and secure the collars<br>
to the rotor core.<br><br>
The electrical and cooling fluid conduits are shielded by a thin walled tube 76 that<br>
extends along the rotor axis from one of the coil end sections 54 and through a collar<br>
62. The cooling conduits in the tube 76 connect to the input and output ports 39, 41<br>
of the cooling passage 38 on the coil winding to the cryogenic transfer coupling 26.<br>
An electrical coupling 79 to the coil is provided at same end section of the coil as the<br>
cooling coupling 26.<br>
The rotor core may be encased in a metallic cylindrical shield 90 that protects the<br>
super-conducting coil winding 34 from eddy currents and other electrical currents that<br>
surround the rotor and provides the vacuum envelope as required to maintain hard<br>
vacuum around the cryogenic components of the rotor. The cylindrical shield 90 may<br>
be formed of a highly conductive material, such as a copper alloy or aluminum.<br>
The SC coil winding 34 is maintained in a vacuum. The vacuum may be formed by<br>
the shield 90 which may include a stainless steel cylindrical layer that forms a vacuum<br>
vessel around the coil and rotor core.<br>
A support bracket 124 is provided to assist the shield 90 withstand the large radial<br>
forces that can result when a grid fault condition occurs. The radial support may be a<br>
rectangular box that fits around the sides 40 of the coil winding and extends over the<br>
split-clamp 58. The support bracket include a pair of side walls that are dovetailed<br>
into a slot in the recessed surface. The side-walls extend from the rotor core surface<br>
48 to the shell 90 and provides structural strength to the shell.<br>
FIGURES 7 to 10 are cross-sectional views of different embodiments of<br>
electromagnetic shields for a rotor. In a first embodiment of an electromagnetic (EM)<br>
shield the shield is a cylindrical copper alloy that surrounds the rotor core 22. The<br>
ends of the shield are brazed to rings of stainless steel. The brazed joint between the<br>
copper shield and stainless steel rings may be furnace brazed. Alternatively, the braze<br>
may be a butt-braze or a scarf-joint braze. The stainless steel rings are attached, e.g.,<br>
welded, to the collars of the rotor.<br>
In a second embodiment shown in FIGURE 9, a cylindrical copper shield % covers<br>
the rotor body and at least a portion of the pair of collars. The cooper shield 96 is<br><br>
attached to the collar, such as using bolts 98 to connect the shield to the collars. In<br>
addition, a stainless steel cylinder 100 is fitted inside the copper shield The stainless<br>
steel cylinder forms a vacuum vessel around the rotor core and SC coil windings. The<br>
stainless steel vacuum vessel may be brazed to the cooper shield.<br>
In a further EM shield embodiment shown in FIGURE 10 the EM shield is a<br>
conductive cylinder 102 formed of a cooper alloy or aluminum. The cylinder<br>
provides an electromagnetic shield and serves as a vacuum vessel for the SC rotor coil<br>
winding. An inside surface of the shield may have annular rims 104 adjacent the<br>
edges of the collars. An elastic O-ring 106 between the collar and rims provides an<br>
air-tight seal to maintain the vacuum around the rim. The shield may be bolted to the<br>
collar.<br>
An external vacuum shield with an internal EM shield is shown in FIGURE 11. A<br>
cylindrical copper alloy EM shield 108 surrounds the rotor 22 and collars 62. The<br>
EM shield may be fastened to the collars 62 with bolts 98. A cylindrical stainless<br>
steel vacuum vessel 109 surrounds the EM shield 108 and may be laminated to the<br>
outer surface of the EM shield.<br>
The bolts 75 that attach the rotor core to the collars are a potential path for air leakage<br>
into the HTS rotor vacuum. To prevent such air leakage from entering the rotor via<br>
the bolts, a stainless steel vacuum shield 110 is welded over the bolt holes on the<br>
outside of the collars. These vacuum shields 110 are welded such that they can<br>
readily removed so as to extract the bolts and disassemble rotor. The vacuum shield<br>
for the rotor bolts may be a ring that covers the bolt holes in the collars.<br>
