SURGICAL PATCH THAT RELEASES PACLITAXEL OR AN ANALOGUE OR DERIVATIVE THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to surgical patches coated with biologically active<br>
agents to prevent adverse tissue reaction to the patch.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Primary closure and patch angioplasty are two techniques of arteriotomy<br>
closure used by surgeons after vascular procedures. In primary closure, the lips of the<br>
arterial wound are directly sutured to each other whereas an extra piece of material is<br>
sutured between the two lips during patch angioplasty. Patch angioplasty is preferred<br>
after procedures with a high rate of postoperative narrowing of the repaired vessel<br>
(endarterectomy of small carotid arteries for example). The added piece of material<br>
maintains the original diameter of the blood vessel and induces favorable local<br>
hemodynamics that otherwise may lead to recurrent stenosis.<br>
Patch angioplasty can be performed with autologous tissue (typically the<br>
patient's saphenous vein) or synthetic material (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or<br>
Dacron). Vein patches have drawbacks such as aneurismal degeneration and rupture.<br>
They require an additional incision to harvest the vein with associated morbidity. The<br>
patient veins may not be suitable for patching. Most importantly, the vein used for the<br>
patch will not be available for coronary artery bypass grafting should the patient require<br>
arterial reconstruction at a later time. For these reasons, the use of synthetic patches has<br>
become increasingly popular.<br>
However, synthetic materials implanted in the vasculature induce<br>
thrombogenic, inflammatory and hyperproliferative responses. Immediately after<br>
implantation, platelets bind to the luminal surface of the prosthesis, triggering the<br>
coagulation cascade and inducing thrombus formation. Thrombus may grow large<br>
enough to cause distal ischemia (stroke in the case of carotid artery patches).<br>
In the days following the procedure, inflammatory cells such as<br>
macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils adhere to the prosthetic lumen and also<br>
migrate into the peri-prosthetic space. These cells release cytokines that promote<br>
smooth muscle cell migration from the adjacent vessel on the luminal surface of the<br>
patch. The cells further proliferate on the patch and secrete extracellular matrix.<br>
Depending on the porosity of the patch material, cells may also migrate through the<br>
pores of the patch from the surrounding tissue into the lumen. In both cases,<br>
hyperplasia causes plaque formation on the luminal surface of the patch and the<br>
adjacent vessels within a few weeks. This reduces luminal area in the treated blood<br>
vessel thus impeding blood flow to the distal tissues.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for a means and a method to prevent<br>
inflammatory reaction, thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia on the luminal<br>
surface of synthetic patches. The present invention meets this need, and further,<br>
provides other, related advantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly stated, the present invention involves methods of making and<br>
using surgical patches which release agents that prevent inflammatory reactions,<br>
thrombus formations and/or intimal hyperplasia. Representative examples of such<br>
agents include cell-cycle inhibitors such as taxanes, camptothecins, doxorubicin,<br>
immunosuppressive drugs (rapamycin, cyclosporins), bromocryptine, tubercidine,<br>
beta-lapachone, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cell cycle<br>
inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, calcium chelating agents, inhibitors of matrix<br>
metalloproteinases, methotrexate, thrombolytic agents, anti-platelet agents and<br>
anticoagulation agents. The presence of these agents, alone or in combination, on the<br>
patch will effectively prevent or inhibit local inflammatory reaction, prevent thrombus<br>
material from building up on the patch and stop cells from proliferating onto the patch.<br>
Thus, within one aspect of the present invention surgical patches (e.g.,<br>
vascular patches) are provided which release an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-<br>
platelet agent, an anticoagulant agent, fibrinolytic agents, a cell-cycle inhibitor agent,<br>
and/or an anti-proliferative agent. Within certain embodiments, the vascular patch is a<br>
synthetic patch (e.g., made of Dacron). Within various embodiments, the anti-<br>
infl;unmatory agent is aspirin, ibuprofen, or a glucocorticoid drug, the anti-coagulant<br>
agent is heparin or hirudin, and the fibrinolytic agent is tissue plasminogen activator,<br>
streptokinase, or urokinase. Within other embodiments, the cell-cycle inhibitor agent is<br>
a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel or docetaxel), a vinca alkaloid (e.g., vinblastine or vincristine),<br>
a podophyllotoxin (e.g., etoposide), an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or<br>
mitoxantrone), or a platinum compound (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin).<br>
Also provided are methods for making surgical patches (e.g., vascular<br>
batches) which release an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-platelet agent, an<br>
anticoagulant, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, a cell-cycle inhibitor, and/or an anti-<br>
proliferative agent, comprising the step of coating at least a part (all or a portion such as<br>
the ends, or one side) of the patch (e.g., by spraying or dipping) with one of the factors<br>
or agents mentioned above. Alternative methods for generating patches (e.g.,<br>
interweaving a patch with a coated thread, or absorbing a desired agent onto the patch)<br>
are described in more detail below. Within further embodiments, the factor or agent<br>
may be mixed or formulated with another compound or carrier (e.g., polymeric or non-<br>
polymeric). In one embodiment of the present invention, only one side of the patch is<br>
coated leaving the other side and most of the thickness of the patch untreated. In<br>
another embodiment, only parts (the edge for example) of the patch are coated.<br>
Within other aspects of the invention, methods are provided for closing<br>
an opening in the biological tissue (e.g., the vasculature), comprising applying to the<br>
opening in a surgical patch as described herein. Within certain embodiments, the<br>
compound or composition may be applied by itself or in a carrier, which may be either<br>
polymeric, or non-polymeric. Within certain embodiments, the surgical patch is a<br>
vascular patch, which is sutured in place.<br>
These and other aspects of the present invention will become evident<br>
upon reference to the following detailed description and attached drawings. In addition,<br>
various references are set forth herein which describe in more detail certain procedures<br>
or compositions (e.g., compounds, proteins, vectors, and their generation, etc.), and are<br>
therefore incorporated by reference in their entirety. When PCT applications are<br>
referred to it is also understood that the corresponding or cited U.S. applications or U.S.<br>
Patents are also incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration showing sites of action within a<br>
biological pathway where Cell Cycle Inhibitors may act to inhibit the cell cycle.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to setting forth the invention, it may be helpful to an understanding<br>
thereof to set forth definitions of certain terms that will be used hereinafter.<br>
"Cell Cycle Inhibitor" as used herein refers to any protein, peptide,<br>
chemical or other molecule which delays or impairs a dividing cell's ability to progress<br>
through the cell cycle and replicate. Cell cycle inhibitors, which prolong or arrest<br>
mitosis (M-phase) or DNA synthesis (S-phase), are particularly effective for the<br>
purposes of this invention as they increase the dividing cell's sensitivity to the effects of<br>
radiation. A wide variety of methods may be utilized to determine the ability of a<br>
compound to inhibit the cell cycle including univariate analysis of cellular DNA content<br>
and multiparameter analysis (see the Examples).<br>
I. PATCHES<br>
Patches are small pieces of material used to mend a tear or a break to<br>
cover a hole or to strengthen a weak place. In medicine, surgical patches are pieces of<br>
synthetic material or biological tissue used to bridge together the defect between the edge<br>
of an incision or a gap in a biological structure (e.g., a vessel wall). Patches are also used<br>
after lung surgery to strengthen the repaired lung.<br>
Synthetic vascular patches are available from medical device companies<br>
such as 1MPRA, WL Gore, Sulzer Vascutek, Shelhigh, Bio Nova International,<br>
Intervascular and Aesculap for example. Tissue-baied vascular patches are available<br>
from Biovascular and St Jude Medical. Representative examples of surgical patches are<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,100,422; 5,104,400; 5,437,900; 5,456,711; 5,641,566;<br>
5,645,915; 6,296,657; and 6,322,593.<br>
Vascular patches as described herein can be, among other uses, during<br>
vascular surgery to repair blood vessels.<br>
II. AGENTS<br>
Anti-inflammatory agents<br>
Inflammation occurs when cells of the immune system are activated in<br>
response to foreign agents or antigens. Leucocytes release lysosomal enzymes.<br>
Arachidonic acid is synthesized and eicosanoids, kinins, complement components and<br>
histamine are released. Cytokines have a powerful chemotactic effect on eosinophils,<br>
neutrophils and macrophages. They also promote local hyperemia and vascular<br>
permeability Superoxide anion is formed by the reduction of molecular oxygen, which<br>
stimulates the production of other reactive molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and<br>
hydroxyl radicals. The interaction of these substances with arachidonic acid results in<br>
the generation of more chemotatic substances, thus perpetuating the inflammatory<br>
process. Anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit one or several of the processes described<br>
above thus interfering with the inflammatory reaction.<br>
Examples of anti-inflammatory drugs include but are not limited to<br>
nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, fenoprofen,<br>
indomethacin, sulindac, meclofenamate, mefenamic acid, tolmetin, phenylbutazone,<br>
piroxicam, diflunisal apazone carprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen; slow-<br>
acting anti-inflammatory drugs such as chloroquinine, hydroxychloroquinine, gold,<br>
penicillamine, levamisole; glucocorticoid drugs such as hydrocortisone, cortisone,<br>
dexamethasone, prednisone, fluocortolone, triamcinolone, fludrocortisone; statins such<br>
as pravastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin; thromboxane inhibitors such as<br>
triazolopyrimidine; immunosuppressive agents such as rapamycin, sirolimus,<br>
tacrolimus, everolimus, cyclosporin A; anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-<br>
10<br>
The anti-inflammatory potential of agents can be assessed by studying<br>
their inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (Everts et al., 2000. Clin.<br>
Rheumatol. 19: 331-343), their inhibition of phospholipase activity and prostaglandine<br>
release (Sampey et al., Mediators Inflamm. 9:125-132, 2000), their inhibition of tumor<br>
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) synthesis and secretion (Joyce et al., Injlamm Res.<br>
46:447-451, 1997), their inhibition of vasodilation and permeability of the<br>
microcirculation (Perratti and Ahluwalia, 2000 Microcirculation 7: 147-161), their<br>
inhibition of toluene di-isocyanate-induced mast cell proliferation and degranulation, of<br>
anti-CD3-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation, of TNF-a-induced cell adhesion<br>
molecule expression, of oedema formation, of interleukin-5 (IL-5)-induced blood<br>
eosinophilia, of IL-5- or platelet activating factor- stimulated pulmonary eosinophilia,<br>
(Johnson, 1995 Allergy 50: 11-14), with neutrophil activation assays (Jackson et al.,<br>
1997 Immunology 90: 502-510), with cytokine gene expression assays (White et al.,<br>
1998 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 46:104-112).<br>
Anti-platelet agents<br>
Hemostasis is the spontaneous arrest of bleeding from a damaged blood<br>
vessel. The normal vascular endothelium is not thrombogenic and circulating blood<br>
platelets and clotting factors do not adhere to it. However, within seconds of damage to<br>
a blood vessel, platelets adhere to the site of injury. As platelets become activated, they<br>
secrete agents such as ADP and prostaglandins that enhance recruitment and adherence<br>
of other platelets. The resulting growing thrombus of aggregated platelets reduces<br>
blood flow and triggers fibrin formation. The fibrin network reinforces the initial<br>
platelet plug thus ensuring long-term hemostasis. At a later stage, platelets release<br>
growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor that promote healing of the<br>
damage blood vessel.<br>
Anti-platelet agents are compounds that interfere with platelet activation,<br>
adhesion or secretion and thus inhibit thrombus formation. Examples of anti-platelet<br>
agents include but are not limited to, aspirin (Awtry, 2000, Circulation, 101: 1206-<br>
1218), ADP receptor antagonists such as clopidogrel, ticlopidine and their active<br>
metabolites (Coukell and Markham, 1997 Drugs 54: 745-750; Muller et al., 2000<br>
Circulation 101: 590-593; Bertrand et al., 2000 Circulation 102: 624-629; Quinn and<br>
F tzgerald, 1999 Circulation 100: 1667-1672), serotonin receptor antagonists (Herbert et<br>
al., 1993 Thromb. Haemostas. 69: 262-2670), platelet glycoprotein receptor antagonists<br>
such as abciximab, tirofiban, eptifibatide, lamifiban, orbofiban, roxifiban, sibrafiban,<br>
lefradafiban, xemilofiban and their active metabolites (Dobesh and Latham, 1998<br>
Pharmacotherapy 18: 663-685; Madan et al., 1998 Circulation 98: 2629-2635), statins<br>
such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin (Igarashi et al., 1997 British<br>
Journal of Pharmacology 120: 1172-1178), cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as<br>
cilostazol (Kimura et al., 1985 Drug Res. 35: 1144-1149); nitric oxyde donors such as<br>
molsidomine, linsidomine, L-arginine 0, alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as<br>
dihydrogeneted ergopeptines, phentolamine, and yohimbin.<br>
The antiplatelet activity of agents can be assayed by monitoring in vitro<br>
platelet aggregation after activation by agonists using turbidimetry or radiolabeled<br>
platelets. In vivo quantification of platelet aggregation can be performed with<br>
radiolabeled platelets in models of arterio-venous shunts, stent placement and graft<br>
implantation. In vivo antiplatelet activity can also be assessed by monitoring arterial<br>
temperature distal to thrombus formation and by determining bleeding time. (Hebert et<br>
al., 1998 Thromb. Haemost. 80: 512-518; Hebert et al., 1993 Arteriosclerosis and<br>
Thrombosis 13: 1171-1179; Harker et al., 1998 Circulation 98: 2461-2469; Yao et al.,<br>
1993 Trans. Associa. AU Physicians 106:110-119).<br>
Anticoagulants<br>
Blood coagulates by the transformation of soluble fibrinogen into<br>
insoluble fibrin. More than a dozen circulating proteins interact in a cascading series of<br>
proteolytic reactions. At each step, an inactive clotting factor undergoes proteolytic<br>
cleavage and become an active protease. This protease activates the next clotting factor.<br>
The end product of the coagulation cascade is the formation of a solid fibrin clot.<br>
Anticoagulants are agents that interfere with the coagulation cascade and<br>
inhibit the formation of fibrin. Examples of anticoagulants include, but are not limited<br>
to, warfarin and coumarin anticoagulants, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, active-site<br>
inactivated factor Vila ( DEGR-VIIa), tick anticoagulant peptide, antithrombin agents<br>
such as heparin, low-molecular-weight-heparin, hirudin, bivalirudin (Jang et al., 1995<br>
Circulation 92: 3041-3050), retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid.<br>
The anticoagulation activity of agents can be assayed by measuring the<br>
activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time (Freund et al., 1993<br>
Thrombosis and Hemostasis 69: 515-521; Jang et al., 1995 Circulation 92: 3041-3050).<br>
Fibrinolytic agents<br>
Fibrinolysis is a naturally occurring process that removes unneeded clots<br>
ones healing has occurred. The critical step in this system is the transformation of<br>
plasminogen into plasmin, a protein-digesting enzyme. Plasmin dissolves thrombus by<br>
lysing fibrin.<br>
Fibrinolytic drugs promote the formation of plasmin. Examples of<br>
fibrinolytic agents include, but are not limited to, tissue plasminogen activator,<br>
uroknase, streptokinase, staphylokinase, anistreplase, reteplase, lanoteplase (Valji,<br>
2000 JVIR 11: 411-420) retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid.<br>
Fibrinolysis activity of agents can be assayed by monitoring the<br>
dissolution of thrombus labeled with radioactive fibrin (Herbert et al., 1993 Thrombosis<br>
and Haemostasis 69: 268-271).<br>
Cell Cycle Inhibitors.<br>
Briefly, a wide variety of cell cycle inhibitory agents can be utilized,<br>
either with or without a carrier (e.g., a polymer or ointment or vector), in order to treat<br>
or prevent a hyperproliferative disease. Representative examples of such agents include<br>
taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel (discussed in more detail below) and docetaxel) (Schiffe et al.,<br>

Within one preferred embodiment of the invention, the cell cycle<br>
inhibitor is taxane such as paclitaxel. Briefly, taxanes are compounds which disrupts<br>
mitosis (M-phase) by binding to tubulin to form abnormal mitotic spindles or an<br>
analogue or derivative thereof. Paclitaxel, the most recognized member of the taxane<br>
family is a highly derivatized diterpenoid (Warn et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:2325,<br>
1971) which has been obtained from the harvested and dried bark of Taxus brevifolia<br>
(Pacific Yew) and Taxomyces Andreanae and Endophytic Fungus of the Pacific Yew<br>
(Stierle et al, Science 60:214-216, 1993). "Paclitaxel" (which should be understood<br>
herein to include formulations, prodrugs, analogues and derivatives such as, for<br>
example, TAXOL®, TAXOTERE®, docetaxel, 10-desacetyl analogues of paclitaxel and<br>
3'N-desbenzoyl-3'N-t-butoxy carbonyl analogues of paclitaxel) may be readily prepared<br>

Antiproliferative agents.<br>
lntimal hyperplasia is due to the migration and proliferation of cells into<br>
the intima followed by extracellular matrix secretion. The main cell types responsible<br>
for the hyperplastic response in the intima are smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.<br>
Arterioles and capillaries sprout into the intimal plaque to provide nutrients and oxygen,<br>
thus allowing the plaque to grow. Intimal plaque growth eventually leads to occlusion<br>
of the lumen of the disease blood vessels with accompanying ischemia to the distal<br>
tissues. Hence, within one aspect of the invention, antiproliferative agents may be<br>
coated on or otherwise released from a patch.<br>
The antiproliferative activity of the agents can be assayed by quantifying<br>
cell migration and proliferation in vitro. Antiproliferative activity can also be<br>
determined in vivo by morphometric analysis after vascular injury in various animal<br>
models (Signore et at, 2001 J. Vase. Interv. Radiol. 12: 79-88; Axel et al., 1997<br>

all incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Patches may be coated with compositions of the present invention in a<br>
variety of manners, including for example: (a) by directly affixing to the patch a<br>
formulation (e.g., by either spraying the stent with a polymer/drug film, or by dipping<br>
the stent into a polymer/drug solution), (b) by coating the patch with a substance such<br>
as a hydrogel which will in turn absorb the composition, (c) by interweaving<br>
formulation-coated thread (or the polymer itself formed into a thread) into the patch<br>
structure, (d) by inserting the patch into a sleeve or mesh which is comprised of, or<br>
coated with, a formulation, or (e) constructing the patch itself with a composition.<br>
Within preferred embodiments of the invention, the composition should<br>
firmly adhere to the patch during storage and at the time of implantation, and should not<br>
be dislodged from the patch when it is sutured to the blood vessel. The composition<br>
should also preferably not degrade during storage, prior to implantation, or when<br>
wanned to body temperature after implantation inside the body. In addition, it should<br>
preferably coat the patch smoothly and evenly, with a uniform distribution of agents while<br>
not changing the patch shape. Within certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the<br>
formulation should be applied to only parts of the patch, leaving the rest of the patch<br>
uncoated, for example: (a) only the luminal side of the patch is coated, (b) only the edge<br>
of the patch is coated, (c) only one end of the patch is coated, (d) a stripe is left uncoated<br>
around the patch (e) part of the patch is coated with one agent and the rest of the patch is<br>
coated with another agent.<br>
Within one preferred embodiments of the invention, the composition<br>
should provide a predictable, prolonged release of the factor into the surrounding tissue<br>
for 1 to 12 months after implantation. Within another embodiments of the invention,<br>
the composition should provide a predictable, slow release of the factor into the<br>
surrounding tissue for 1 to 10 years after implantation. Within another embodiments of<br>
the invention, the composition should provide a predictable, prolonged release of the<br>
factor into the surrounding tissue for 1 to 4 weeks after implantation. Within another<br>
embodiments of the invention, the composition should provide a predictable, fast<br>
release of the factor into the surrounding tissue for 1 to 7 days after implantation.<br>
Within another embodiments of the invention, the composition should provide a<br>
predictable, fast release of the factor into the surrounding tissue for 1 to 24 hours after<br>
implantation. Within another embodiments of the invention, the composition is not<br>
released into the surrounding tissue. Its presence on the patch forms a chemical barrier<br>
preventing cellular adhesion to the patch, cell migration onto the patch or cell<br>
proliferation on the patch. Within certain embodiments of the invention, compositions<br>
may be combined in order to achieve a desired effect (e.g., several preparations may be<br>
combined in order to achieve both a quick and a slow or prolonged release of a given<br>
factor).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated to contain<br>
more than one agent, to contain a variety of additional compounds, to have certain<br>
physical properties (e.g., elasticity, a particular melting point, or a specified release<br>
rate).<br>
In addition to the above properties, the composition should not cause<br>
significant turbulence in blood flow (not more than the patch itself would be expected<br>
to cause if it was uncoated).<br>
The compositions and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may<br>
be placed within containers, along with packaging material which provides instructions<br>
regarding the use of such materials. Generally, such instructions will include a tangible<br>
expression describing the reagent concentration, as well as within certain embodiments,<br>
relative amounts of excipient ingredients.<br>
IV. APPLICATION<br>
Primary closure and patch angioplasty are two techniques of arteriotomy<br>
closure used by surgeons after vascular procedures. In primary closure, the lips of the<br>
arterial wound are directly sutured to each other whereas an extra piece of material is<br>
sutured between the two lips during patch angioplasty. Patch angioplasty is preferred<br>
after procedures with a high rate of postoperative narrowing of the repaired vessel<br>
(endarterectomy of small carotid arteries or redo operations for example). The added<br>
piece of material maintains the original diameter of the blood vessel and induces<br>
favorable local hemodynamics that otherwise may lead to recurrent stenosis (Clagett et,<br>
1986 J Vase Surg. 3:10-23; Deriu et al., 1984 Stroke, 15: 972-979; Archie 2001 J Vase<br>
Surg. 33: 495-503; Ouriel 1987 J Vase Surg. 5:702-706; AbuRahma et al., 1998 J Vase<br>
Surg 27: 222-234; Riles et al., 1990 Surgery 107: 10-12;).<br>
Patch angioplasty is mainly performed in two vascular procedures at the<br>
present time, carotid endarterectomy and profundaplasty. However, vascular patches<br>
are also used in other vascular procedures, for example to repair iatrogenic or traumatic<br>
arterial injuries or to repair the arterial wall after resection of a saccular aneurysm. The<br>
present invention could be applied to any vascular patching procedure.<br>
Patch angioplasty can be performed with autologous tissue (typically a<br>
segment of the patient's veins) or synthetic material (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
or Dacron). Vein patches have drawbacks such as aneurysmal degeneration and rupture<br>
(Archie et al., Surgery 1990, 107: 389-396). They require an additional incision to<br>
harvest the vein with associated morbidity. Vein harvest also increases operative time.<br>
The patient's veins may not be suitable for patching. Most importantly, the vein used<br>
for the patch will not be available for coronary artery bypass grafting should the patient<br>
require arterial reconstruction at a later time. For these reasons, the use of synthetic<br>
patches has become increasingly popular.<br>
Patch angioplasty improves clinical outcome in many cases but it does<br>
not afford absolute protection against recurrent carotid stenosis (Awad et al., 1989<br>
Stroke 20: 417-422; Eikelboom et al., 1988 J Vase Surg 7: 240-247; AbuRahma et al.,<br>
1998 J Vase Surg 27: 222-234; AbuRahma et al., 1998 J Vase Surg 27: 222-234; Clagett<br>
et al., 1986 J Vase Surg 3: 10-23). Synthetic patches implanted in the vasculature<br>
induce thrombogenic, inflammatory and hyperproliferative responses. Immediately<br>
after implantation, platelets bind to the luminal surface of the prosthesis, triggering the<br>
coagulation cascade and inducing thrombus formation. Thrombus may grow large<br>
enough to cause distal ischemia. Parts of the thrombus may also become dislodged and<br>
cause embolization of distal arterioles and capillaries. In the case of carotid artery<br>
patches, thrombus occlusion and embolization lead to stroke.<br>
In the days following the procedure, inflammatory cells such as<br>
macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils adhere to the prosthetic lumen and also<br>
migrate into the peri-prosthetic space. These cells release cytokines that promote smooth<br>
muscle cell migration from the adjacent vessel on the luminal surface of the patch. The<br>
cells further proliferate on the patch and secrete extracellular matrix. Depending on the<br>
porosity of the patch material, cells may also migrate through the pores of the patch from<br>
the surrounding tissue into the lumen. In both cases, hyperplasia causes plaque formation<br>
on the luminal surface of the patch and the adjacent vessels within a few weeks. This<br>
reduces luminal area in the treated blood vessel, thus impeding blood flow to the distal<br>
tissue. The present invention involves coating synthetic patches with agents preventing<br>
inflammatory reaction, thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia in order to inhibit<br>
restenosis of the treated vessel.<br>
A. Carotid endarterectomv<br>
A 10-cm long skin incision is made along the anterior border of the<br>
sternocleidomastoid muscle. After retraction of the muscle, the distal common carotid<br>
artery, the carotid bifurcation and the proximal segments of the internal and external<br>
carotid arteries are dissected. The three vessels are clamped. An arteriotomy is made in<br>
the common carotid artery extending antero-laterally through the plaque into the<br>
internal carotid artery beyond the distal extension of the plaque. The intimo-medial<br>
layer of the plaque is transected in the common carotid and the plaque is excised to the<br>
adventitia. A coated patch is trimmed and tapered to appropriate size (typically 7 cm<br>
iong with a 4 mm apex and a 7 mm bulb). The coated patch is placed along the edges<br>
of the arteriotomy to reconstruct the original shape of the vessel and to replace a<br>
significant portion of the endarterectomized wall of the artery. The coated patch is<br>
sutured to the edges of the arteriotomy with a continuous 7-0 polypropylene suture.<br>
Blood flow is restored by releasing all clamps and the skin wound is closed.<br>
B. Profundaplasty<br>
The common femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery (PFA) are<br>
isolated through a vertical groin incision. Once the branches distal to the end of the<br>
occlusive disease are controlled, the common femoral, superficial femoral and the PFA<br>
branches are clamped. An arteriotomy is performed, starting on the common femoral and<br>
extending down the PFA until the plaque ends. Endarterectomy of the involved common<br>
ft moral and PFA is performed as needed. A coated patch is trimmed to size to achieve a<br>
smooth taper in the PFA to re-establish optimal flow characteristics in the repaired vessel.<br>
The coated patch is sutured to the edges of the arteriotomy with a continuous 7-0<br>
polypropylene suture. Blood flow is restored by releasing all clamps and the skin wound<br>
is closed.<br>
It should be obvious to one of skill in the art that the above-described<br>
compositions can be utilized to create variation in the Examples provided below,<br>
without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Manufacture of Coated Patches<br>
A. Procedure for Sprayed Patches<br>
The following describes a typical method using an oval 2 cm x 0.5 cm<br>
synthetic patch. For larger patches, larger volumes of polymer/drug solution are used.<br>
Briefly, a sufficient quantity of polymer is weighed directly into a 20 mL<br>
glass scintillation vial, and sufficient DCM added in order to achieve a 2% w/v solution.<br>
The vial is then capped and mixed by hand in order to dissolve the polymer. The patch<br>
is then held in a vertical orientation with micro clamps connected to a holding apparatus<br>
6 to 12 inches above the fume hood floor to enable horizontal spraying. Using an<br>
automatic pipette, a suitable volume (minimum 5ml) of the 2% polymer solution is<br>
transferred to a separate 20ml glass scintillation vial. An appropriate amount of<br>
paclitaxel is then added to the solution and dissolved by hand shaking.<br>
To prepare for spraying, remove the cap of this vial and dip the barrel of<br>
a TLC atomizer into the polymer solution. Note that the reservoir of the atomizer need<br>
not be used in this procedure: the 20ml glass vial acts as a reservoir. Connect the<br>
nitrogen tank to the gas inlet of the atomizer. Gradually increase the pressure until<br>
atomization and spraying begins. Note the pressure and use this pressure throughout<br>
the procedure. To spray the patch use 5 second oscillating sprays with a 15 second dry<br>
time between sprays. After 5 sprays, rotate the patch 180° and spray the other side of<br>
the patch. During the dry time, finger crimp the gas line to avoid wastage of the spray.<br>
Spraying is continued until a suitable amount of polymer is deposited on the patch. The<br>
amount may be based on the specific patching application in vivo. To determine the<br>
amount,weigh the patch after spraying has been completed and the patch has dried.<br>
Subtract the original weight of the patch from the finished weight. This produces the<br>
amount of polymer (plus paclitaxel) applied to the patch. Store the coated patch in a<br>
sealed container.<br>
B. Procedure for Dipped Patches<br>
The following describes a typical method using a 2 cm x 0.5 cm oval<br>
synthetic patch. For larger patches, larger volumes of polymer/drug solution are used.<br>
Weigh 2 g of polymer into a 20 mL glass scintillation vial and add 20<br>
mL of DCM. Cap the vial and leave it for 2 hours to dissolve (hand shake the vial<br>
frequently to assist the dissolving process). Weigh a known amount of paclitaxel<br>
directly into an 8 mL glass vial and add 4 mL of the polymeric solution. Using a glass<br>
Pasteur pipette, dissolve paclitaxel by gently pumping the polymer solution. Once<br>
paclitaxel is dissolved, hold the glass vial in a near horizontal position (the sticky<br>
polymer solution will not flow out). Using tweezers, insert the patch into the vial all the<br>
v/ay to the bottom. Allow the polymer solution to flow almost to the mouth of the vial<br>
by angling the mouth below horizontal and then restoring the vial to an angle slightly<br>
above the horizontal. Slowly remove the patch (approximately 30 seconds). Hold the<br>
patch in a vertical position to dry.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In Vitro Drug Release Rate<br>
Small pieces (0.5x0.5cm) of paclitaxel-coated patches (n=4) are placed<br>
in 14 mL glass tubes followed by 10 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH=7.4)<br>
containing 0.4 g/L albumin. The tubes are incubated at 37 °C with gentle rotational<br>
mixing at 8 rprn. At regular time intervals, 10 mL' of supernatant are withdrawn for<br>
paclitaxel analysis and replaced with fresh PBS/albumin buffer. One mL of<br>
dichloromethane is added to the withdrawn supernatant and the tube is capped and<br>
shaken by hand for 1 minute to allow all the released paclitaxel to partition into the<br>
separate dichloromethane phase. The tubes are then centrifuged at 500xg for 1 minute,<br>
the 10 mL of top aqueous phase are withdrawn and discarded and the dichloromethane<br>
phase is evaporated under nitrogen at 50 °C for 20 minutes. One mL of a 60%<br>
aeetomtrite in water (v/v) solution is added to each tube to solubilize the dried contents.<br>
These solutions are then analyzed for paclitaxel by HPLC using a Waters C18 Novapak<br>
column with a mobile phase composed of 58% acetonitrite / 5% methanol / 37% water<br>
at a flow rate of 1 mL / minute with detection at 232 nm. The HPLC method for<br>
quantitation of the released drug is chosen over other methods, such as radiolabelled<br>
assays, because the chromatographic method ensures that only paclitaxel molecules in<br>
the intact (non-degraded) form are measured. A standard curve of paclitaxel dissolved<br>
in 60% acetonitrile: 40% water is obtained in the 0-50 µg/mL range and used to directly<br>
quantitate the amount of paclitaxel released.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In Vivo Patch Efficacy<br>
General anesthesia is induced into domestic swine. The neck region is<br>
shaved and the skin sterilized with cleansing solution. A vertical incision is made under<br>
sterile condition on one side of the neck and the common carotid artery is exposed.<br>
Two vascular clamps are placed on the artery to temporarily stop blood flow and an<br>
arteriotomy is performed between the clamps. The arteriotomy is closed with a<br>
synthetic patch. The animals are randomized into 4 groups of 5 pigs receiving a<br>
synthetic patch coated with (1) carrier polymer alone, (2) carrier polymer loaded with<br>
1% paclitaxel, (3) carrier polymer loaded with 5% paclitaxel or (4) carrier polymer<br>
loaded with 10% paclitaxel. The clamps are released and the skin is closed.<br>
The contralateral carotid artery is prepared in the same manner and a<br>
control uncoated patch is used to repair the arteriotomy. The animal is recovered.<br>
The animals are sacrificed at 1 month and perfused with saline followed<br>
by 10% phosphate buffered formaldehyde for 30 minutes under 100mmHg pressure.<br>
The carotid arteries are removed and kept in the same fixative solution overnight. The<br>
specimens are then prepared for histology. Cross sections are cut and stained with H&amp;E<br>
and Movat's stains. Histopathology of the tissue surrounding the patch is recorded.<br>
Morphometric analysis is performed to measure hyperplasia on the luminal surface of<br>
the patch and in adjacent vessels.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific<br>
embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration,<br>
various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.<br>
