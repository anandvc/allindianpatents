FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates loan improved wet scrubber for simultaneous scrubbing of particiulate and gaseous matters in a gas-liquid/gas-Hquid-solid, contacting unit.<br>
This invention further relates to an improved wet scrubber for simultaneous scrubbing of particulate and gaseous matters in a gas-liquid/gas-liquid-solid, contacting unit, which achieves intense inter-phase mixing without any mechanical device with moving parts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Good inter-phase mixing is essential for successful gas-liquid/gas-liquid-solid contacting operations in a gas disposal system (bubble column). In commonly available bubble columns, bubbles are sparged into a liquid column at the bottom and as the bubbles rise through the liquid, they coalesce and reduce the effective area for gas-liquid contact.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the bubble columns known in the art.<br>
One of the main disadvantages is that the continuous generation and splitting of bubbles to regenerate new surface area demands developing highly efficient gas-llquid/gas-llquid-solld contacting systems. Such requirements are seldom achieved in industrial practice, as these are associated with mechanical complications and high energy dissipation.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Another disadvantage associated with the known wet scrubbers of the art is that because of the physical and chemical properties of gas and liquids, commercially available bubble columns mostly give single-stage contacting which are not more than 60 to 70% efficient with regard to transfer or mass or chemical species. However, present pollution control legislation demands almost 100% removal of pollutants from an exhaust effluent stream.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to the propose an Improved wet scrubber for simultaneous scrubbing of particular and gaseous matters which reduces processing costs and overcomes aft the drawbacks mentioned above with relation to the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved wet scrubber for a gas-llquid solid contacting system, which is highly compact and at the same time operates in multi-stage series mode to yield very high overall efficiency without adding on to the capital cost of additional equipment or specialised maintenance procedure.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved wet scrubber in which the number of stages can be easify varied to achieve very high efficiency even when (he individual stage efficiencies are limited by physical parameters of the system.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved wet scrubber which versatile, have no moving parts and easy to fabricate, install and maintain.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose an improved wel scrubber in which solids can be handled without serious erosion or plugging problems.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose an improved wet scrubber with little floor space requirements and low capital investment.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to propose an improved wet<br>
scrubber which achieves bubble breakup and regeneration through the hydrodynamic instabilities in two-phase flow, sudden flow contractions followed by controlled flow expansion and contraction lead to instabilities which lead to continuous regeneration, breakup and regeneration of bubble<br><br>
-- 5 --<br>
Surface area.   The scrubber operates in a number of stages and improved gas dispersion and mixing enhances both individual stage efficiencied and overall column efficiency. The number of stages is proposed to be varied to achieve very high efficiency even when the individual stage efficiencies are limited by physical parameters of the system.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an improved wet scrubber for simultaneous scrubbing of particulate and gaseous matters in a gas-liquid/gas-liquid-solid contacting unit, comprising, a vertical column, a multi-orifice antenna type sparger provided at between the first stage and the second stage of the three-stage bubble column, a sedimentation chamber connected to the column through a vaive and the water from the said sedimentation chamber is recirculated through a valve and pump to the top of the second stage column at inlet and gasous pollutants are pumped through the bottom of the first stage of the column characterized in that within the second stage vertical column, a combination of small apertured horizontal contraction disks and with an aperture and large apertured horizontal expansion screen with 4/5 mesh alternately placed to impose sequentially, sudden and slow disturbances which leads to a very high inter-phase transfer.<br><br>

The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying   drawings.<br>
Fig     1     shows     a    schematic    diagram       of    the    improved 'scrubber;   and<br>
Fig      2      shows      in     tabular      form      the     comparison     of     power consumption     and     hydrodynamic     characteristic     for     various     gas-liquid   contacting    equipments   with   the   present   invention. SUMMARY  OF   THE   PRESENT     INVENTION     .<br>
The device of the present invention is highly versatile, compact and efficient gas dispersed system commonly known as bubble column, which can be used as a wet scrubber to control air pollution, for adding oxygen to waste water for removing BOD,     as    simple    gas    absorbers     for    absorbing    a    soluble    gas    and<br>
as     two/three     phase     chemical     reactors     or     as     bio-reactors     and<br>
fermenter,    etc.      In   between   the  first    stage   (15)   and   the   second<br>
stage (1) of an experimental three-stage column bubbles are generated in the size range of 3-6mmf using a unique multi-orifice   antenna   type  sparger   (5).   The   sparger   (5)   design<br><br>
7.<br>
has been tailored to give identical velocities through individual<br>
orifices,  to insure  uniform  generation  of  relatively  large<br>
bubbles. The antenna type sparger (5) covers more than 95%<br>
of total column area and distributes the bubbles uniformly over the  entire  cross  section  of  the  column.  Because  of  the construction of the sparger (5) with 144 holes each of 1.6 mm and due to the high gas velocity maintained at the sparger (5) orifices,  the bubbles rise almost vertically in this section wihotit bubble pairing or bubble coalescence- At the end of this stage, the bubbles are allowed to deform and collapse in response to the sudden flow disturbance imposed on them. This is achieved by constricting the flow cross-sectional area to about 25^ of the original column diameter by using a relatively small aperture . construction disk (3) at least one and upto 3 such construction disk (3)  is placed alternatively and equally spaced with at least one end upto 3 expansion screens (2) with 4/5 mesh (6). On reaching the lower surface of the disk (3) bubbles slide radially toward the central axtal opening (6,7) of the disks (2,3). Migration of the bubbles towards this opening (6.7) leads to bubble crowding, direct  impaction, infringement and bubble coalescence.<br><br>
8.<br>
As the constricted passage gets choked with bubbles trying to move upwards, all the bubbles collapse into a single large bubble or slug. Vigorous bubble collapse create very turbulent churning action at the disk opening (6,7). However, on passing through this disk opening (6,7),  the superficial gas velocity increases to sixteen times the original empty column superficial velocity  a velocity which leads to the breakup of the larger bubbles at the upper part of the disk (2,3). In this section (section -II or State  II,  (1)  a relatively large apertured expansion  screen  (2)  is  positioned above  the small apertured disk (3) to prevent bubble migration to the wall of the column (1)  and  to  insure  axial  movement  of  the  bubble  swarms. Furthermore,  this  increase  in  flow area   reduces the forward velocity of the bubbles due to reduction in the pressure of the liquid surrounding the bubbles leads to stretching of the bubble surface.<br>
The bubbles deform and split under the influence of intrinsic instabilities as well as in homogeneities in the pressure field. Above and equidistant from the expansion screen, a second smaller contraction disk (3) has been provided again to create bubble crowdng, coalescence and bubble regeneration as described above. Break up  of the bubbles  in  the  liquid continuum entraps the solid particls (e.g.  flyash in the exhaust of a Thermal Power<br><br>
9.<br>
Plant) in water which are continuously washed out by the stream of  the  flowing  liquid  (L).  The second stage column (l) is provided with flanges (4) at the top and bottom for connection of the first stage (15) at the bottom and to the third stage (16)  at  the  top-  Inlet  
column, The liquid is sprayed at two or three points.along the<br><br>
verticie height of the second sta&amp;e of the column (r)with course water sprays (17).<br>
The third stage (16) of the babble column is L-shaped and the outlet (12) for the clean gas has a diameter equal to the opening (?) of the small diameter horizontal contraction disk(3). The resulting slurry containing flyash can be continuously sedimented out and withdrawn from the column through a sedimentation chamber (8). The resulting relatively clean water being recirculated to the top of the column*<br><br>
10.<br>
Acid formed in the water by the absorption of acidic gaseous emissions needs to be only partial1y neutralised for flyash which are alkaline. Or is neutralised by a system which adds alkaline solution  to  the  water as necessary  to  maintain  the  Hat a nominal  value  .  Water containing  the  formed  sediment at  the bottom of the sedimentation chamber may be pumped to one or more sedimentation tanks and clarifiers where a sludge is fprmed and the remaining water is either disposed of or recycled for further use. Within the vertical, a dynamic system is established which  is  held stable both  mechanically and chemically during continuous operation.<br>
Simultaneously gaseous pollutants (13) are also absorbed by the highly turbulent liquid films created in the system due to continuous and very vigorous bubble formation, bubble bursting<br>
and bubble re-formation.<br>
The  device is  very  versatile  and  the  intensity  of<br>
gas-liquid-solid mixing can be easily regulated by controlling the aperture diameters _(6,7) and relative position of the aperture disks (2,3)<br><br>
11..<br>
The device  maintains  high  liquid  (slurry)  phase contact<br>
for the reaction to take place and excellent heat transfer properties  for easy temperature control.  The  system has high<br>
interface mass transfer rates at low energy input and a very high percentage upto 99.9% efficiency of removal of flyash laden<br>
so2.<br><br>
The device is  extremely versatile and can be adusted to<br>
generate bubbles of different sizes by adjusting the apertured disks (2,3) (aperture diameter (7) and mesh (6) ) and relative distance between them in the vertical column (l). It would be possible to induce shear-free mixing for shear sensitive material.<br>
The power consumption is low and is 200 to 4 50W/M3 of the vessel. The column (l) and the contraction/expansion disks (2,3) may  be made of any  suitable  material,  like  concrete,  steel,<br>
plastic or glass.<br>
The device has high turn-down ratio and can operate with<br>
high efficiency over a wide range of flow rates.  The overall efficiency can be calculated by the formulae:<br><br>
12..<br>
The different values of n1,n2,n3  are n1 =0.60-0.70, n2 =0.85-0.90,n3=0.85-0.90 nT =0.99-0.995 and in many cases 100% where n1,n2,n3 are individual stage efficiencies and nT <br>
is the overall efficiency of the system.<br>
The  above  formulae  indicates  that  even  difficult devices <br>
can be treated to achieve very high efficiency, even when the individual stage efficiencies are not very high. In this case, large number of stages should be used.<br>
