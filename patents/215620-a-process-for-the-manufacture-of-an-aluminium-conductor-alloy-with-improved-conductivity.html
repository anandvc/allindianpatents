				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of an aluminium conductor alloy with improved conductivity.<br>
Aluminium has been in use for many years in such applications as electrical conductors due to its desirable combination of relatively high conductivity and low weight. The most popular form of aluminium for this purpose has been that formerly known as EC aluminium and now known by its Aluminium Association Registration No. 1350. Various other aluminium alloys have been formulated as replacement material for alloy 1350, such as 6201, 8001, stabiloy, triple, etc. Many high temperature resistance aluminium alloys have been developed making use of the elevation of recrystallisation temperature imparted by Zr compounds. A few of the alloys developed using rare earth or calcium are listed below :<br>

Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd has developed an aluminium alloy through the Japanese patent JAJ 8447365A of 1983.

None of these particular references teaches the alloy system contemplated by the present invention. The object of the present invention is top provide a method to enhance the electrical conductivity of the presently used electrical grade aluminium and the commercial grade aluminium.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of an aluminium conductor alloy with enhanced conductivity and comprising of<br>
said process comprises preparing aluminium melt by heating aluminium and degassing successively by hexachloro ethane and dry nitrogen, adding 0.01 to 1 wt% rare earth metal selected from cerium, yttrium or misch metal and 0.005 to 0.2 wt% calcium, either in the elemental form or as master alloy, homogenizing , cooling and casting to obtain the desired alloy.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aluminium used is commercial grade of 99% purity.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the aluminium melt is maintained at a temperature in the range of 740 to 800 ° C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the degassing of the melt is effected using hexachloroethane and nitrogen.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the rare earth and calcium used are commercial grade of 99 % purity.<br>
The unique properties of the alloy of the present invention are achieved by adding Ce, Y or misch metal and Ca to the aluminium base alloy to enhance the conductivity. The addition of these alloying elements acts as a "scavenging agent" in the aluminium base to improve the conductivity.<br>
The unique properties of the alloy of the present invention are achieved by the process of addition of cerium, yttrium or misch metal from 0.01 to 1% by weight together<br>
with calcium from 0.005 to 0.2% by weight. The process could be modified to add yttrium or<br><br>
misch metal instead of cerium to the same level. The base aluminium may contain 0.1 to 1% by weight iron, 0.05 to 0.5% by weight silicon, 0.001 to 0.1% by weight titanium, vanadium, copper and manganese upto 0.1% other impurities and the balance aluminium.<br>
Alloys within these ranges to which cerium addition is particularly useful are those alloys containing 0.01 to 0.6% by weight iron and 0.01 to 0.5% by weight silicon. Aluminium generally contains small amounts of impurities originating either from the ore or from the process of extraction. Iron and silicon are the major impurities. Titanium, vanadium, zirconium and chromium, which go into solid solution with aluminium, may be present to small levels and seriously impair the electrical conductivity. They are generally precipitated out by the addition of boron to the levels of half of the above impurities. The present process utilises the addition of either cerium, yttrium or misch metal together with calcium to scavenge the major impurities like iron and silicon. The alloy may be cast in metal moulds or may be cast in conventional manner such as continuous cast. The cast billet or bars may be optionally homogenised at a temperature range of 300-500°C for 30 minutes to 2 hrs. The billet or bars homogenised or not, is deformed at elevated temperature in the range of 300 to 500°C. These deformed rods are annealed at between 300 to 450°C for 30 minutes to 6 hrs prior to cold drawing to the final wire form. The drawn wires may be further annealed to increase the electrical conductivity further but at the expense of strength.<br>
The process and the alloy developed is illustrated by the following five examples and should not be constructed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
