TECHANICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a process of laying cast in place concrete pipes (CIPCP or CIPP) by using CIPCP machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unlike precast pipe here the complete manufacturing-installation process takes place simultaneously in a trench which has required to size and shape bottom and vertical or near vertical sides walls excavated to the outside dimension of the pipe. Pipe of required size and shape is cast into the bottom of the trench by self-propelled machine.<br>
OLD PROCESS<br>
Till date in India, Concrete Pipes are Pre-Cast. Here the process of pipe laying is as follows:<br>
A)	Manufacturing of Concrete Pipe,<br>
B)	Procurement of Concrete Pipe,<br>
C)	Excavation<br>
D)	Bedding Soling, PCC, etc.<br>
E)	Laying of pipes<br>
F)	Filling Joints<br>
G)	Encasing if required<br>
H) Back-filling<br><br>
DRAWBACK OF OLD PROCESS<br>
1.	Time consuming.<br>
2.	Costlier.<br>
3.	Have joints at regular short intervals.<br>
4.	Laborious<br>
5.	Less stable under external forces.<br>
6.	Consists reinforcement, which may corrode latter on.<br>
7.	Inconvenience to the traffic and others.<br>
8.	Hazardous, Etc.<br>
INVENTION<br>
1.	The Cast-in-place concrete pipe process begins with a " Size to fit" trench, excavated manually or mechanically so as to create vertical or near vertical line on the trench wall &amp; required shape bottom. Refer fig 1.<br>
2.	The Cast-in-place machine" The Boat" is positioned in the trench. Size and shape of boat depends on the size and shape of pipe. Refer fig 2<br>
3.	The metallic interior forms covering more than half the top circumference say about top 3/4th of the circumference or about top 270Â° degrees are inserted into the machine and hooked together to provide continuous support during a day's pour. Refer fig 3.<br>
4.	Inside the Cast-in-place concrete pipe machine, the forms are<br>
held in place by struts or some other means. Refer fig 3.<br>
5.	The concrete pour starts and the machine moves long the<br>
trench.<br><br><br>
6.	As the pour progresses, the pipe is laid &amp; the machine moves forward. As machine moves forward the outside as well as inside of the pipe is hand or mechanically finished. Newly cast pipes are than cured.<br>
7.	After concrete has set, the forms are released and removed and is kept ready for next work. Back filling is done after concrete had initial set and attains required strength.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	Saves Money: - Cast-in-place concrete pipe<br>
a). Eliminates transportation.<br>
b). Eliminates cost of lowering pipe c). No over excavation or expensive bedding materials, d). No Reinforcement. These bring savings as compared with pre-cast pipes.<br>
2.	Saves Times: - Faster than traditional method.<br>
3.	Less Labour - CIPP or CIPCP are manufactured and installed<br>
simultaneously by in the trench.<br>
4.	Joint less construction of CIPP reduces failure and maintenance problem.<br>
5.	Stability- Minimum trench width, perfect bedding and backfill increase the stability of CIPP.<br>
6.	Better Quality: Due to design innovation of side shoulders CIPP as compared to pre-cast pipes are:<br><br>
-	of superior flexural strength and<br>
-	have increased resistance to external loading<br>
7.	since CIPP provides perfect bending from bottom, it have<br>
increased resistance to external loading.<br>
8.	No reinforcement: - CIPP is a non-reinforcement concrete pipe. Hence, chances of rusting of reinforcement are not there, thus more durable.<br>
9.	Multi-burial pipes may be used giving added advantage. Refer fig. 7<br><br>
10.	Less inconvenience to the traffic: - Since no pipes are required to stored at site and also since the entire process of laying pipe is faster, CIPP technology provides very less inconvenience to the traffic.<br>
11.	Earlier break event points: these results in added benefits to the client.<br>
12.	Less hazardous and safer: Since loading, unloading and laying of heavy pre-cast pipes is not required CIPP technology is much safer and much less hazardous.<br>
13 Since CIPP technology provides on line checking there is no buried  mistakes.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process of laying cast in place concrete pipes ,by using CIPP machine as herein described comprising:<br>

b)	lowering of the CIPP machine into the trench;<br>
c)	laying of required interior form the said machine;<br>
d)	Pouring concrete mix as per design into the hopper of the CIPP machine to fill around the form to required thickness, shape and size;<br>
e)	Moving the CIPP machine with the help of winch, which anchors, to an anchor, leaving the form clang with the concrete mix behind in the trench;<br>
f)	Fixing of bracings inside the metal form to hold the form in place while the machine moves forwards; and<br>
g)	Curing the laid concrete pipe.<br>

APPLICATION<br>
CIP concrete pipe is not intended for every application nor as a substitute for all other types of pipe. However, over the years it has proven to be every bit as efficient and dependable for storm drains, culverts, and irrigation lines- as pre-cast reinforced concrete pipe, and other types. As a matter of fact, the hydraulics characteristics of CIPP have proven to be comparable or superior to other types of pipe installations.<br>
CAST IN PLACE PIPE IS IDEAL FOR:<br>
-	Storm Drain<br>
-	Sanitary Sewer<br>
-	Irrigation<br>
-	Culvert<br>
-	In place of Open Canal.<br>
-	Other Gravity Flows<br>
-	Under ground support system<br><br>
THE CIPP MACHINE AND ITS OPERATION<br>
The CIPP machine is designed as a steel sled, which closely fits the sides and bottom of the trench. A variable speed winch mounted on the front end of the machine, takes up on a steel cable anchored to an anchoring device, which anchors to the sides of the trench. As pipe is cast, the machine pulls itself forward at a variable rate, depending on the diameter of pipe. The winch may be electrically operated or engine operated. The engine also operates an electric generator, which powers the machine's vibrators, tampers and lights, with outlets for additional concrete vibrators. Alternatively, one may use external electric generator or other types of vibrators, tampers and lights.<br>
The description refers to fig 1 to 7 of the accompanying drawings<br>
At the rear of the machine is a mandrel assembly,which consists of<br>
(1)	a hopper to receive the fresh concretes,<br>
(2)	an upper trowel plate which forms the crown of he pipe, and<br>
(3)	a lower trowel plate which forms the invert portion of the pipe barrel. Trowel plates are pre-set to extrude pipe to the required diameter, shape and minimum required wall thickness.<br>
(Refer fig. 5 &amp; 6)<br>
To reduce friction as the machine moves forward over the forms, the<br>
top portion of the mandrel assembly consists of a circular cage of<br>
rollers. Alternatively, one may use other methods to reduce reiction.<br>
The assembly is attached to the machine by a pin, ball, and socket,<br>
which allow it to swivel during the installation on curves and "S"<br>
turns.<br>
As concrete is fed into the hopper, the powered spading mechanism<br>
moves the concrete down into the reservoir areas where the variable<br>
speed vibrators aid the flow of concrete. The duration of vibration<br>
needed is determined by the slump of concrete, and controlled by<br><br>
the operator.<br>
The entire toweling assembly is designed to extrude concrete under pressure. This results in an extremely dense consolidation of concrete, which is necessary to meet the strength criteria of the pipe as designed. Fig. 3 illustrates the relative positions of the forms.<br>
As the machine moves forward, the upper and lower trowel plates leave a screeded finish on the outside of the crown and on the invert of the pipe. The entire process results in a well-consolidated concrete conduit whose total cross-section has been poured in one continuous process.<br>
INTERIOR FORMS<br>
Prior to the start of pouring, semi-circular metallic forms are hand-fed in to the machine, locked into position and braced with arch spreaders. The forms support approximately upper 270 deg. of the fresh poured concrete to ensure uniform internal diameter of the pipe. Length of form varies depending on the availability of material and method of handling.<br>
Standard CIPCP machines are normally available for all sizes from 600 mm to 3000 mm, in 150 mm increments. Other size and shape machine may be manufactured as per requirement. Where additional capacity is required, or minimal headroom exists, multiple barrels of the same size or different sizes can be poured wall to wall. Refer Fig. 4. Pipe wall thickness has been designed to correspond to the, various diameters of pipe to provide the normal load carrying capabilities. Standard minimum wall thickness and total pipe widths are given in Table I<br><br>
PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS<br><br>
Note: Wall Thickness may vary as per design for same size of diameter.<br>
