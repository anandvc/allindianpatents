The invention relates to a process for the preparation<br>
of 5H,9bH-2a,4a,7,9a-Octahydro-tetraazacycloocta[cd]-pentalene (CAS RN 67705-42-4) of formula (I), described below, is an intermediate for the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane derivatives wherein three nitrogen atoms are substituted with the same functional group, for example a carboxymethyl group, whereas the fourth nitrogen atom is substituted with a group different from the previous one.<br>
It is particularly important, for example, the synthesis of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid (more commonly known as D03A), of formula (II), which was described in various works, first in EP 292,689 and in EP 23,2751 and subsequently in a paper (Dischino et al., Inorg. Chem., 1991, 30, 1265), wherein the synthesis according to scheme 1 is described in detail.<br><br><br>
The step from the commercially available starting product 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (III), to compound of formula (I) is effected according to the conventional method described in US 4,085,106, followed by formation of 1-formyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane of formula (IV) in water-alcohol medium.<br>
This intermediate is subsequently tricarboxymethy-lated with tert-butyl bromoacetate (TBBA) in dimethylformamide, then treated with a toluene-sodium hydroxide diphasic mixture to give the compound of formula (V), 10-formyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid, tris(1,1-dimethylethyl) ester, which is then hydrolysed to compound of formula (II) in acidic solution.<br>
Macrocyclic derivatives of this type are intermediates for the preparation of gadolinium complexes which can be used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance (MRI), such as Gadoteridol of formula (VI), gadolinium complex of 10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid, or Gadobutrol of formula (VII), gadolinium complex of [10-[2,3-dihydroxy-l-(hydroxymethy1)propyl]-1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid.<br><br><br>
The preparation of compound (I) at high purity-level in easily reproducible conditions is an essential requirement for the preparation of these important diagnostic agents on industrial scale.<br>
Compound (I) and its preparation were described first in US 4,130,715 or in US 4,085,106, such a process being used also in the other references wherein this type of intermediate is necessary.<br>
The described procedures are based on the use of dialkylformamides-dialkylacetals: for example, J. Atkins (cited patents) discloses the synthesis of compound (I) in an aromatic solvent (benzene), by reacting 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane and JV,JV-dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (usually in equimolar amounts) without catalyst.<br>
Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, dialkyl ethers and alkylnitriles can be used as alternative solvents to the aromatic ones.<br>
Atkins himself (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 6364-<br><br>
6365)  makes  also  reference  to  the  possibility  of operating in the absence of solvents.<br>
Although these conditions provide compound (I) in good yields, their application on industrial scale is difficult due to the extreme reactivity of dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal towards such nucleophiles as water and the compound (I) itself.<br>
In order to avoid an excessive formation of by¬products, which involves a decrease in the yield and a worsening in the quality of compound (I), it is necessary: a) to operate in anhydrous conditions and b) to add dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal in amounts which are equimolar to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane or, anyway, such as to cause a complete conversion of the latter.<br>
The presence of water in the reaction can involve, on one hand, the destruction of dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal and, on the other hand, the hydrolysis of compound (I) to l-formyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane, which can in turn react with dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal and produce further by-products.<br>
Commercial 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane usually contains water in minimum percentages, whichi is however sufficient to hydrolyse an unnegligible part of the reactive or of the compound (I) itself: it is therefore necessary for the reaction environment to be dry before the addition of dimethylformamide-dialkylacetal. If the used solvent is an aromatic solvent, the reaction solution is particularly troublesome to dry: for example, the distillation of the water-toluene azeotrope involves high consumptions of the organic solvent and it<br><br>
requires rather long times, thus affecting productivity.<br>
On the other hand, the addition of dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal is critical, in that an excess thereof causes anyway the rapid formation of by¬products, whereas a lack thereof means that some residual 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane is still present, to the detriment of the progress of the synthesis for the preparation of the above cited macrocyclic derivatives. The control of the reaction stoichiometry is quite critical and difficult, considering also that dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal assay tends to decrease with time. On an industrial scale, therefore, successful results can be obtained only when the progress of the reaction is checked through a number of process controls: for example, 1,4,7,10-tetrazazaciclododecane actually disappears generally only after gradual additions of dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal, determined by gas-chromatographic controls.<br>
A further complication deriving from the use of a dialkylformamide-dialkylacetal on an industrial scale is that the plant must be equipped with a suitable gas scrubber, if the above cited reactive is commercially available, such as W, ./V-dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal or N,.W-dimethylformamide-diethylacetal. The reaction carried out with these reactives causes, in fact, the formation of gaseous dimethylamine, which has to be suitably removed, for example by means of a sulfuric acid absorber.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction is usually carried out in the presence of rather high amounts of an aromatic<br><br>
.-in¬solvent, thereby affecting productivity and costs in<br>
terms of purchase, recovery and disposal of the used<br>
solvent:  as  a  matter  of  fact,  the  mass  reaction<br>
described by Atkins is of little applicability on an<br>
industrial scale as the first reagent is highly reactive<br>
and highly toxic and the second one is a solid, thus<br>
causing problems  in terms of operation and thermal<br>
control.<br>
Finally, the high cost of dimethylformamide dimethylacetal makes the process less attractive.<br>
The main alternative to dialkylformamides-dialkylacetals consists in the use of trialkyl orthoformates, which have, according to literature (Weisman, Tetrahedron Letters, 21, 3635-3638, 1980), a lower reactivity than the above mentioned dialkylformamides-dialkylacetals, so that the reaction cannot be completed, in spite of the addition of an acid catalyst.<br>
The low yields reported by Weisman in the case of reactions carried out in aromatic solvents do not support the applicability of the procedure on an industrial scale.<br>
On the other hand, the examples of acid-catalyzed mass reactions between polyamines and triethyl orthoformate (Stetter, Chem. Ber. 106, 2523-2529, 1973) are characterized as well by yields too low for any industrial applications in the synthesis of the compound (I), which would be extremely uneconomic.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, and this is the object of the present invention, that, in suitable conditions,   1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane   can   be<br><br>
r<br>
transformed into compound (I) in high yields, using precisely triethyl orthoformate, in the absence of solvent and in the presence of an acid catalyst at high temperature.<br>
Conditions excluding oxygen and light from the reaction environment are further preferred, oxygen being excluded, for example, making use of the usual nitrogen blanket techniques.<br>
Triethyl orthoformate can be added in amounts ranging from 105% to 200% on the stoichiometric value.<br>
The reaction temperature can range from 110 to 150"C and the reaction time from 4 to 24 hours.<br>
The catalyst is a carboxylic acid having at least 3 carbon atoms, C^-C^Q, preferably selected from the group consisting of propionic, butyric and pivalic acids, and it is added in amounts ranging between 4 and 42 g/kg substrate.<br>
Triethyl orthoformate is a cheaper product than J^iV-dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal, produces no harmful, not-condensable gaseous by-products, but only ethanol, which can be advantageously recovered for the preparation of triethyl orthoformate or for other synthetic purposes.<br>
Moreover, triethyl orthoformate is less reactive than tf/./V-dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal, which makes it possible to carry out the additions of the reactives and the reaction itself in utterly safe conditions even on a large scale; it allows to better monitor the progress of the reaction on the basis of such operative parameters as time and temperature, without checking the progress by gas chromatography, and makes the addition<br><br>
of the reactive less critical, in that it can be added from the very beginning without causing the formation of undesired by-products: all that rendering the process suitable for the production of compound (I) in easily reproducible conditions.<br>
As in the case of. /V,./V-dimethylformamide-dimethyl-acetal, water contained in commercial 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane has to be removed: water removal can easily be performed either by melting 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane in nitrogen flux, or by addition of a suitable solvent and subsequent distillation of the solvent to a residue of dry melt 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane at a temperature higher than 110'C.<br>
Ethyl orthoformate and the acid catalyst can directly be added to this residue without any thermal control or safety problems, in that orthoformate is poorly reactive and the reaction is not exothermic.<br>
The drying solvent can be selected from straight or branched (C^-Cg) alcohols, preferably from the group consisting of: 1-butanol, 2-butanol, amyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol.<br>
The reaction involves evolution of ethanol: a first amount of the evolved ethanol remains in the reaction mixture, until it reaches such a concentration that the vapor pressure of the reaction mixture reaches the atmospheric value: from this point on, the evolved ethanol distils from the reaction mixture together with a small amount of orthoformate. To avoid losses of orthoformate, the evolved vapor can easily be rectified with a small rectification column: the distillate from<br><br>
the head of the column is substantially pure ethanol, whereas the liquid from the bottom, which is enriched in orthoformate, is recycled to the reactor.<br>
In pre-set operative conditions, the measurement of the weight or of the volume of the evolved ethanol is a convenient, precise index of the progress of the reaction.<br>
When the reaction is completed, depending on the synthetic purposes, compound (I) can be used as such or it can be purified by fractional distillation. In both cases, the yield in compound (I) is extremely high (typically 95 - 98% for crude compound (I) and higher than 90% for purified compound (I)).<br>
It is a further object of the present invention the process for the preparation of compound (II), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid, comprising the following steps:<br>
a) preparation of 5H,9bH-2a,4a,7,9a-octahydro-tetra-azacycloocta[cd]pentalene starting from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane according to the method of the invention, which compound, without being isolated, is carboxymethylated and subsequently hydrolysed according to known methods to give the desired product.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 5H,9bH-2a,4a,7,9a octahydrotetraazacycloocta [cd] pentalene of the formula (I)<br><br>
CI) comprising reacting 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane of the formula III<br>
* <br>
(III)<br>
with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of a known acid catalyst with the exclusion of oxygen by means of a nitrogen blanket in the absence of a solvent and recovering said compound of formula I by known means.<br>

to pH 1.7 with cone. HC1, and pH is controlled at this value for 2 h. After that, the solution is heated at 50°C, pH is adjusted to 7 with sodium hydroxide, and the solution is maintained at these conditions for 1 h.<br>
E)	Prepurification of the Gadoteridol crude solution<br>
The Gadoteridol crude solution from the previous<br>
step is cooled and transferred through an in line filter and a column packed with 150 L of R&amp;H Amberlite XAD 1600 resin to a nanofiltration unit fitted with Desal DK4040F elements. When the reactor is empty, the reactor, the in line filter and the column are washed three times with 300 L of deionized water. The resulting washing solution is combined with the product solution in the nanofiltration unit, where the product is concentrated and partially desalted at 32 bar and 25*C.<br>
250 L of crude Gadoteridol solution with a conductivity of 2.9 mS/cm are obtained finally.<br>
F)	Final desalting<br>
The Gadoteridol solution is then fed at 200 L/h to a series of 4 ion exchanger beds, the first (CI) consisting of 120 L of strongly basic anion exchanger Relite 3ASfb in the hydrogen carbonate form, the second (C2) consisting of 100 L of weakly acidic cation exchanger Relite CC in the H+ form, the third (C3) consisting of 20 L of Relite 3ASfb in the OH- form and the fourth (C4) consisting of 20 L of Relite CC resin in the H+ form. All the columns are vented to the atmosphere and the liquid from the second column is passed through a gas separation tank, connected with a vacuum pump, to remove the evolved CC^ from the solution. The outlet from the fourth column is fitted<br><br>
with a density transmitter to detect the product in the eluate. The first 180 L of eluate are discarded; the eluate is then collected in a product-rich fraction. When all the crude Gadoteridol solution has been loaded onto the ion exchange unit, the product is eluted with 600 L of deionized water, the eluate is then combined with the product-rich fraction, which is colourless and substantially free from ionic impurities (conductivity 2.2 uS/cm).<br>
The yield of the final desalting, determined by HPLC, is 98%. G)  Recovery of the product (Gadoteridol)<br>
The product-rich fraction is then thermally concentrated to a viscous residue, which is added with 350 kg of isopropanol at 79'C.<br>
The resulting suspension is refluxed for 1 h, then cooled, centrifuged and dried at reduced pressure, to obtain  68.2  kg  of  Gadoteridol  containing  10%  of hydration water (0.111 kmol), HPLC assay 98.5% (s.a.). Overall yield: 80.7%<br>
The ^H-NMR, IR and MS spectra are consistent with the indicated structure.<br><br>
