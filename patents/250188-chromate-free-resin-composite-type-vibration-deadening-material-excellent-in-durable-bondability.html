				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CHROMATE-FREE RESIN-COMPOSITE TYPE VIBRATION DEADENING MATERIAL EXCELLENT IN DURABLE BONDABILITY<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a composite type vibration deadening material, more particularly, relates to a composite type vibration deadening material exhibiting a high vibration deadening performance and excellent bonding strength and excellent also in workability and heat resistance, used as structural members of industrial machines, transportation machines, home appliances, acoustic equipment, electronic equipment, information equipment, buildings, and other various structures or part thereof. [Background Art]<br>
In recent years, particularly in many industrial fields such as manufacturing and transportation, improvement of the work environment on the production floors has been demanded. As part of this, the standard of noise and vibration are becoming more severe. Further, in general homes as well, noise in the living environment is troublesome for the neighbors, therefore a higher silence is also being demand for home electric appliances and machinery products.<br>
Particularly, in equipment constituted by metal materials, vibration is easily transmitted. Metal panels have become a source of noise in many cases. Therefore, countermeasures for preventing vibration and preventing noise are strongly demanded.<br>
Conventionally, as one of the vibration deadening materials used for preventing noise and vibration, a composite type vibration deadening material having a multilayer structure comprised of metal layers sandwiching an intermediate layer made of a viscoelastic resin composition has been proposed.<br>
Such a composite type vibration deadening material has the function of converting vibration energy to heat energy by slip deformation of the intermediate viscoelastic resin layer generated along with bending vibration of the composite type vibration deadening material, attenuating the vibration rate and vibration amplitude, and reducing sound propagation. Such a composite type vibration deadening material exhibits its best vibration deadening performance by direct contact with a vibration source or use as a cover or other part of a vibration source body.<br>
Due to this, such a composite type vibration deadening material is actually used for purposes of automobile oil pans, engine head covers, engine room shield plates, dash panels, floor panels, gear covers, chain covers, muffler covers, mufflers, floor housings, and other parts of automobiles, motorcycles, farm machinery, etc,, motor covers, compressor covers, evaporator covers, and other parts of freezing temperature adjustment equipment, computer cases, hard disk drive cases, speaker frames, and other parts of acoustic electronic equipment, chain saw covers, generator covers, lawn mower covers, and other parts of outdoor equipment, steps, doors, flooring, roofing, and other construction materials, and other applications.<br>
Further, use of such composite type vibration deadening materials is also being studied for many other products for which a vibration deadening property is demanded.<br>
On the other hand in metal materials used in the fields of home electric products and automobiles, chromate treatment, which is cheap and has excellent corrosion performance, is widely used as a temporary rust prevention and paint undercoat, but in recent years, from the viewpoint of protection of the global environment, use of environmental load substances (lead, hexavalent chromium, cadmium, mercury, etc.) is being strictly<br>
regulated.<br>
For the purpose of raising the bondability between the metal sheet and the intermediate viscoelastic resin layer in a composite type vibration deadening material, chromate treatment is carried out as the undercoat treatment of the metal sheet bonding surface. Therefore, development of a composite type vibration deadening material without using chromate has been demanded.<br>
Conventionally, in the field of surface-treated steel sheet, various studies have been made for techniques to replace chromate. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 04-48081 discloses a method of treatment by a transition metal (VIA group)-based aqueous ammonium molybdate solution for which the same passivation function as that by chromic acid is expected.<br>
Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication {Kokai) No. 2003-55777 discloses a chromate-free treated hot dip zinc-aluminum alloy plated steel sheet having a coat containing a zirconium compound and a vanadic compound. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-89868 discloses an example of a non-chromate chemical treatment containing a tannic acid, a silane coupling agent, and silica particles.<br>
As the viscoelastic resin or the viscoelastic resin composition used in the intermediate layer of the composite type vibration deadening material, many viscoelastic resins or viscoelastic resin compositions are known.<br>
For example, a polyester resin (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 50-143880) or a resin composition comprised of a polyester resin plus a plasticizer (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 52-93770), resin compositions obtained by combining a plurality of polyester resins (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 62-295949 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication<br>
 (Kokai) No. 63-202446), a polyurethane resin foam (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 51-91981), a polyamide resin (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent. Publication (Kokai) No. 56-159160), an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 51-34949], an isocyanate prepolymer and vinyl monomer copolymer (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 55-27975), a polyvinyl acetal resin (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-88149), etc. are known.<br>
Further, for the purpose of maintaining the high vibration deadening performance and bonding strength, the present inventors developed a viscoelastic resin composition using a cross-linking agent and made of a mixture of a plurality of viscoelastic resins.<br>
If giving concrete examples, for example, as the technique of using a cross-linking agent, there are a viscoelastic resin composition containing a specific amorphous block copolymerizable polyester resin made of a high glass transition temperature segment and a low glass transition temperature segment such as a lactone component (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 01-198622), a viscoelastic resin composition containing a polyester resin synthesized using a glycol having a dimer acid or a hydrogenated dimer acid and a side chain as a starting material (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 06-329770), a viscoelastic resin composition containing a copolymerizable polyester resin having an aromatic ring in the side chain (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 06-329771), a viscoelastic resin composition containing a copolymerizable polyester resin having a side chain having five or more carbon atoms (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 07-179735), and so on.<br>
By using these inventions as the intermediate viscoelastic resin composition of the composite type<br>
vibration deadening material, the vibration deadening property, the bonding strength, and a high heat resistance can be realized. [Summary of The Invention]<br>
Summarizing the problems to be solved by the invention, as described above, in the field of surface treated steel sheets, chromate-free treatment is spreading, but unfortunately a chromate-free bonding undercoat treatment giving a bondability equivalent to that by chromate treatment, particularly durable bondability, has not yet actually been found for a composite type vibration deadening material.<br>
Particularly, the viscoelastic resin compositions disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 01-198622, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication {Kokai) No. 06-329770, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 06-329771, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 07-179735 developed by the present inventors are based on thermosetting polyester-based resins and create hydrogen bonds with the chromic acid hydrate of the chromate treatment applied to the surface of the metal sheet to manifest a high bonding strength.<br>
The conventional chromate-free treatment, however; could not obtain a bonding strength as good as that of chromate treatment.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a chromate-free type composite type vibration deadening material having an excellent bonding strength, particularly durable bondability, equivalent to that by a conventional chromate treated composite type vibration deadening material.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present inventors intensively studied the optimum combination of the vibration deadening resin and the chromate-free undercoat agent and consequently found the fact that a particularly conspicuous durable bondability was obtained<br>
by a combination of a specific vibration deadening resin and chromate-free undercoat agent.<br>
Namely, the present invention provides: (1)  A chromate-free resin-composite type vibration deadening material excellent in durable bondability having a multilayer structure comprised of a viscoelastic resin composition sandwiched between metal sheets as an intermediate layer, characterized by that:<br>
(1)	the viscoelastic resin composition is a<br>
thermosetting resin comprised of an amorphous<br>
copolymerizable polyester resin and a curing agent end<br>
(ii) the surfaces of the metal sheets on the sides contacting the viscoelastic resin layer are provided with chromate-free bonding undercoats comprising 5 mass% to 50 mass% of silica, 5 mass% to 50 mass% of a polyester resin, 1 mass% to 50 mass% of tannic acid, and 0 mass% to 30 mass% of a silane coupling agent.<br>
(2)	A chromate-free resin-composite type vibration<br>
deadening material excellent in durable bondability as<br>
set forth in (1), wherein the curing agent is comprised<br>
of at least one type of curing agent selected from the<br>
group consisting of a polyepoxy compound, polyisocyanate<br>
compound, and acid anhydride.<br>
(3)	A chromate-free resin-composite type vibration<br>
deadening material excellent in durable bondability as<br>
set forth in (1) or (2), wherein the amount of deposition<br>
of the chromate-free bonding undercoat on the metal sheet<br>
surface is 3 to 900 mg/m2.<br>
(4)	A chromate-free resin-composite type vibration<br>
deadening material excellent in durable bondability as<br>
set forth in any one of (1) to (3), wherein the metal<br>
sheet is a steel sheet, plated steel sheet, stainless<br>
steel sheet, aluminum sheet, or titanium sheet.<br>
The resin-composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention does not contain hexavalent chromium in the undercoat treatment layers of the surfaces of the metal sheets on the sides contacting<br>
the viscoelastic resin layer, therefore is more excellent than the resin-composite type vibration deadening material using the conventional chromate-based undercoat treatment in view of the environmental load.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, by combining a specific chromate-free bonding undercoat (comprising components of 5 mass% to 50 mass% of silica, 5 mass% to 50 mass% of polyester resin, 1 mass% to 50 mass% of tannic acid, and 0 mass% to 30 mass% of a silane coupling agent) and a specific viscoelastic resin composition (thermosetting ciscoelastic resin composition made of an amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin and a curing agent), an initial bonding strength equivalent to that by a conventional resin-composite type vibration deadening material using a chromate-based bonding irndercoat agent is obtained, therefore the shaping property is excellent.<br>
Thus, present composition is a synergistic composition. Further,  the  result  is  equivalent  to  a  conventional resin-composite type  vibration deadening material yusing a chromate-based  bonding  undercoat  agent  in  the  durable bondability as well, so is extremely useful as a vibration and noise reduction amterial having a small environmental load.

Due  to  the  amorphous  polyester  resin,  the vibtation<br>

Further, when the content of the polycarboxylic acid bonding units exceeds 60 mol%, the bonding strength sometimes becomes insufficient.<br>
Further, as the monomer forming the polycarboxylic acid bonding units used in the present invention, use may be made of a trifunctional or higher polycarboxylic acid such as trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid according to need within a range of a small amount not degrading the characteristics of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention.<br>

Further, the upper limit of the content of the glycol bonding units is not particularly determined and may be 100 mol% as well. When the content of the glycol bonding units having four or more carbon atoms having the alkyl group in the side chain is less than 30 mol%, the vibration deadening performance sometimes becomes insufficient.<br>

These glycols each having four or more carbon atoms having the alkyl group in the side chain may be used<br>
solely or used in combinations of two or more types together.<br>
Further, as the monomer forming the polyol bonding units other than the glycol bonding units having four or more carbon atoms having the alkyl group in the side chain used in the present invention (also referred to as "the other polyol used in the present invention"), there can be mentioned aliphatic glycols such as ethyleneglyccl, propyleneglycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,9-nonanediol, 1,10-decanediol, eicosanediol, diethyleneglycol, triethyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, and polytetramethyleneglycol polycarbonate diol; an alicyclic glycol such as 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and tricyclodecanedimethanol; an aromatic diol such as an ethylene oxide additive such as bisphenol A or bisphenol S or propylene oxide additive.<br>

Further, as the monomer forming the polyol bonding unit used in the present invention, use may be made of a trifunctional or higher polyol such as trimethylolpropane, glycerin, and pentaerythritol according to need within a range of a small amount not degrading the characteristics of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention.<br>
Here, among the monomers forming the polyol bonding units used in the present invention, the content of the trifunctional or higher polyol is preferably 0.5 mol% or more, further preferably 1 mol% or more.<br>
Note that the content of the trifunctional or higher polycarboxylic acid explained above is not limited so long as it is 0.5 mol% or more. Further, the content of these trifunctional or higher polyols is preferably 10 mol% or less, more further preferably 0.5 mol% or less.<br>
When the content of these trifunctional or higher polyols is less than 0.5 mol%, the curability and the<br>

There are many combinations of compositions of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin obtained from such polycarboxylic acid bonding units and polyol bonding units. These are appropriately selected according to the intended coagulation force of the resin, bonding strength, vibration deadening performance, etc.<br>
For example, from the viewpoint of for example the vibration deadening performance, the preferred combination is one where 40 mol% or more of the polycarboxylic acid bonding units are aromatic dicarboxylic acid units, 30 mol% or more of the polyol bonding units are glycol bonding units having four or more carbon atoms having an alkyl group in the side, chain, and the content of the trifunctional or higher polycarboxylic acid is 0.5 mol% or more.<br>
And the most preferred combination is one where 50 mol% or more of the polycarboxylic acid bonding units are aromatic dicarboxylic acid units, 50 mol% or more of the polyol bonding units are glycol bonding units having four or more carbon atoms having the alkyl group in the side chain, and the content of the trifunctional or higher polycarboxylic acid is 1 mol% or more.<br>
Further, as mentioned above, from the viewpoint of the adjustment of the glass transition temperature of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin obtained from the polycarboxylic acid bonding units and the polyol bonding units and the improvement of the bondability or the reactivity with the curing agent, it is possible to use a known method to add a ring-shaped ester group by open ring addition to the terminal end of the molecular chain for polymerization and add polyhydroxycarboxylic acid block bonding units.<br>
The polyhydroxycarboxylic acid block bonding units of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin used in the present invention are not particularly limited in type and amount so far as the copolymerizable polyester resin is amorphous, but the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid must be block copolymerizable.<br>
As the ring-shaped esters imparting the<br>
polyhydroxycarboxylic acid block bonding units, there can be mentioned p-propiolactone, 0-2,2-dimethylpropiolactone,<br>
6-valerolactone, 6-3-methylvalerolactone, ε-caprolactone, and enantolactone.<br><method of production amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin><br>
The method of production of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin used in the present invention is not particularly limited. Use can be made of a known method of production.<br>
For example, there can be mentioned a method of production of charging the polycarboxyliic acid and ol component in a vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere, performing an esterification and/or transesterification reaction under a constant temperature condition over a constant time, and then performing a polycondensation reaction under high vacuum under a constant temperature condition over a constant time.<br>
Here, in the above method of production, the temperature condition of the esterification and/or<br>
transesterification reaction is preferably 140°C or more, more particularly preferably 160°C or more. Further, this temperature condition is preferably 260°C or less, particularly preferably 240°C or less.<br>
When this temperature condition is less than 140°C, the reaction late tends to be lowered, while when this temperature condition exceeds 260°C, decomposition of the product tends to become conspicuous.<br>
Further, in the above method of production, the<br>
reaction time of the esterification and/or transesterification reaction is preferably 0.5 hour or more, particularly preferably 1 hour or more. Further, this reaction time is preferably 24 hours or less, particularly preferably 12 hours or less.<br>
When this reaction time is less than 0.5 hour, the esterification and/or transesterification reaction tends not to proceed sufficiently, while a reaction time exceeding 24 hours is not preferred from the viewpoint of the economy.<br>
Then, in the above method of production, the temperature condition of the polycondensation reaction is preferably 180°C or more, more preferably 200°C or more. Further, this temperature condition is preferably 300CC or less, particularly preferably 280°C or less.<br>
When this temperature condition is less than 180°C, the polycondensation tends not to proceed at a sufficient speed, while when this temperature condition exceeds 300°C, the molecular weight of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin tends to be insufficient due to the decomposition of the product.<br>
Further, in the above method of production, the reaction time of the polycondensation reaction is preferably 0.5 hour or more, particularly preferably 1 hour or more. Further, this reaction time is preferably 5 hours or less, particularly preferably 3 hours or less.<br>
When this reaction time is less than 0.5 hour, the polycondensation of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin tends not to proceed until a sufficient amount of molecuJ.es are obtained, while when this reaction time exceeds 5 hours, the decomposition of the product tends to become conspicuous.<br>
Further, in the above method of production, the pressure in vessel at the time of the polycondensation reaction is preferably 660 Pa or less, particularly preferably 130 Pa or less. When the pressure in the<br>
vessel exceeds 660 Pa, the polycondensation of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin tends not to proceed until a sufficient amount of molecules are obtained.<br>
Further, in the above method of production, the polycondensation reaction can proceed even without a catalyst, but in general, preferably the polycondensation reaction is carried out by adding a catalyst.<br>
The type of this catalyst is not particularly limited. Preferably use can be made of a known polymerization use catalyst for a amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin. As concrete examples, there can be mentioned calcium acetate, zinc acetate, dibutyl tin oxide, dibutyl lead dilaurate, germanium oxide, antimony trioxide, tetrabutyl titanate, etc. These catalysts may be used solely or used in combinations of two or more types.<br>
Further, in the above method of production, the content of the catalyst in the polycondensation reaction solution is preferably 1 ppm or more, particularly preferably 30 ppm or more. Further, the content of this catalyst is preferably 5000 ppm or less, particularly preferably 2000 ppm or less.<br>
When the content of this catalyst is less than 1 ppm, the reaction rate tends to be lowered, while when the content of this catalyst exceeds 5000 ppm, the decomposition and coloring of the product tend to become conspicuous.<br><weight average molecular weight of amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin><br>
The weight average molecular weight of the copolymerizable polyester resin used in the present invention measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) must be 5000 or more, preferably 8000 or more.<br>
Further, this weight average molecular weight is not, particularly limited in upper limit, but preferably is 50000 or less, particularly preferably 40000 or less,<br>
from the viewpoint cf workability in the production process of the viscoelastic resin composition.<br>
When this weight average molecular weight is less than 5000, there is the problem that both of the vibration deadening performance and bonding strength of the viscoelastic resin composition are lowered. Further, from the viewpoints of the vibration deadening performance and bonding strength of the viscoelastic resin composition, this weight average molecular weight is preferably as high as possible and is preferably determined to the optimum value in practical use. However, when this weight average molecular weight exceeds 50000, the workability in the production process of the viscoelastic resin composition tends to be lowered, so this is not preferred.<br><glass transition temperature of amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin><br>
The temperature at which the vibration deadening performance becomes the maximum is mainly determined according to the glass transition point temperature of the amorphous copolymeri2able polyester resin, but in the selection of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin, a resin having the optimum glass transition point temperature may be appropriately selected so that the desired temperature peak of the vibration deadening property is obtained.<br>
For example, when the composite type vibration deadening material using a viscoelastic resin composition comprising the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin of the present invention as a component is used near ordinary temperature, the glass transition point temperature of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin is preferably -60°C or more, more preferably -40°C or more. Further, this glass transition temperature is preferably 0°C or less, more preferably -10°C or less.<br>
When this glass transition temperature is less than<br>
-60°C and exceeds 0°C, according to the type and amount of the curing agent, the vibration deadening performance is sometimes not exhibited near ordinary temperature.<br>
Here, the glass transition temperature of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin can be measured by a known method by using a differential scan calorimeter (DSC) or the like.<br><curing agent><br>
The viscoelastic resin composition used in the present invention includes a curing agent able to form cross-links by reaction with the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin as an indispensable component.<br>
Here, the curing agent used in the present invention is not particularly limited.

Namely, as the curing agent used in the present invention, a polyepoxy compound, polyisocyanate compound, or acid anhydride may be used alone or may be used in a mixture in a combination of a polyisocyanate compound and polyepoxy compound, a polyepoxy compound and an acid anhydride, or a polyepoxy compound, an acid anhydride, and a polyisocyanate compound.<br>
By thermosetting after incorporating the curing agent used in the present invention into the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin used in the present invention to form cross-links, the bondability of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention is improved, therefore the moldability and workability of the composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention are improved and the heat resistance after shaping and processing is improved.<br>
In the same way, the hydrolysis resistance of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention is improved, so it can be considered that also the durability of the composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention is enhanced.<br><polyepoxy compounds><br>
Here, the polyepoxy compound used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but preferably use can be made of polyepoxy compounds such as epibis type epoxy resins, aliphatic epoxy resins, alicyclic epoxy resins, glycidyl ether-based resins, glycidyl ester-based resins, glycidyl amine-based resins, novolac type epoxy resins, and heterocyclic epoxy resins.<br>
Further, among these polyepoxy compounds, from the viewpoint of the curability, particularly preferably u$e is made of a polyepoxy compound having two or more glycidyl groups in one molecule.<br>
Further, as concrete examples of the polyepoxy compounds used in the present invention, there can be mentioned bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, bisphenol A di-ß-methylglycidyl ether, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether, bisphenol S diglycidyl ether, tetrahydroxyphenylmethane tetraglycidyl ether, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, brominated bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, novolac glycidyl ether, sorbitol glycidyl ether, polyalkyleneglycol diglycidyl ether, hydrogenated bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A alkyleneoxidei additive, epoxyurethane resin, glycerol triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether, phthalic acid diglycidyl ester, tetrahydrophthalic acid diglycidyl ester, hexahydrophthalic acid diglycidyl ester, acrylic acid diglycidyl ester, dimer acid diglycidyl ester, diglycidyl-p-oxybenzoate ester, diglycidylpropylene urea, tetraglycidyldiaminodiphenylmethane, triglycidyl isocyanate, epoxy polybutadiene, epoxy soybean oil, etc.<br>
These polyepoxy compounds may be used alone or used<br>
in combinations of two or more types as well.<br>
Then, among these polyepoxy compounds, from the viewpoint of the balance of the vibration deadening performance and bonding strength, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, bisphenol F diglycidyl ether, and the novolac glycidyl ether compounds are particularly preferred.<br><polyisocyanate compounds><br>
Here, the polyisocyanate compound used in the present invention is not particularly limited. For example, aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic bifunctional or higher polyisocyanate compounds can be preferably used.<br>
Further, among these polyisocyanate compounds, from the viewpoints of volatility, bondability, and durability, trifunctional or higher polyisocyanate compounds are particularly preferred.<br>
Further, as concrete examples of the polyisocyanate compounds used in the present invention, there can be mentioned diisocyanate compounds such as 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate (TDI), 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HD1), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), phenylene diisocyanate, naphthalene diisocyanate, xylene diisocyanate, hydrogenated diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and hydrogenared xylene diisocyanate; and terminal end isocyanate group-containing compounds obtained by reacting a trimer of these isocyanate compounds and an excessive amount of these isocyanate compounds with a low molecular active hydrogen compound such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylolpropane, glycerol, sorbitol, ethylene diamine, monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, triethanol amine, or a high molecular active hydrogen compound such as various types of polyester polyols, polyether polyols, and polyamides.<br>
These polyisocyanate compounds can be used alone or may be used in combinations of two or more types.<br>
Here, the polyisocyanate compound used in the<br>
present invention may be a blocked isocyanate compound as well. Among these polyisocyanate compounds, from the viewpoint of the vibration deadening performance, a trimer of TDI or HDI or a reaction product of TDI or HDI with trimethylol propane is particularly preferred.<br><acid anhydrides><br>
Into the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention, an acid anhydride is incorporated together with the polyepoxy compound.<br>
In this case, the polyepoxy compound reacts with the acid terminal of the polyester or the acid anhydride or the OH terminal of the polyester reacts with the acid anhydride to become an acid terminal. This acidic terminal reacts with the epoxy compound, whereby the cross-linking reaction is advanced. Therefore, it can be said that the acid anhydride has the effect of promoting the cross-linking reaction of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention.<br>
Here, the acid anhydride used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but for example, among aliphatic acid anhydrides, alicyclic acid anhydrides, and aromatic acid anhydrides, ones having one or more acid anhydz-ide groups in the molecule can be mentioned.<br>
Further, among these acid anhydrides, from the viewpoint of the curability, ones having two or more acid anhydride groups in the molecule are particularly preferred.<br>

When the epoxy compound and the acid anhydride are incorporated as the curing agent used in the present invention into the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin used in the present invention and then thermoset to form the cross-linking, the terminal function group of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin has a higher reactivity with a carboxyl group than a hydroxyl group, therefore the bondability of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention is further improved, and as a result, it is considered that the durability of the composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention is further enhanced.<br><blended amount of curing agents><br>
The blended amount of the curing agent in the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention differs according to the type and blended amount of the amorphous copclymerizable polyester resin to be incorporated and the characteristic required for the composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention, but preferably is 3 parts by mass or more, particularly preferably 5 parts by mass or more, with respect to 100 parts by weight of the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin.<br>
Further, the blended amount of this curing agent is preferably 50 parts by mass or less, particularly preferably 35 parts by mass or less.<br>
When the blended amount of this curing agent is less than 3 parts by mass, the curability of the viscoelastic resin composition is lowered, therefore also the bonding strength tends to be lowered, while when the blended amount of this curing agent exceeds 50 parts by mass, generally the solubility of the two is lowered, and both of the bonding strength and vibration deadening performance tend to be lowered.<br><br>
In the visccelastic resin composition of the present invention, other than the above-described components, for<br>
the purpose of raising the vibration deadening property of the viscoelastic resin composition, a viscosity imparting agent such as a phenolic compound, denatured rosin, gum rosin, coumarone-indene resin, and xylene resin (also referred to as a tackifier) can be appropriately selected and incorporated according to need within a range net degrading the characteristics of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention,<br>
Further, the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention may incorporate various types of fillers, plasticizers, antioxidants, UV-ray absorbers, anti-static agents, or fire retardants according to need within a range not degrading the characteristics of the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention.<br>
As concrete examples, for the purpose of raising the resin strength, various types of fibers such as glass fiber, polyester fiber, polyethylene fiber, and carbon fiber and various types of inorganic particles such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, mica, talc, and kaolin may be incorporated as well.<br>
For the purpose of further raising the vibration deadening performance at a low temperature, various types of plasticizers such as diester phthalate, diester sebacate, triester trimellate, triphenyl phosphate, and paraffin chromate may be incorporated as well.<br>
For the purpose of raising the heat resistance, antioxidants such as a phenol system and hindered amine system can be incorporated. For the purpose of raising the bondability of the other mixed inorganic substance and the resin, various types of coupling agents may be incorporated as well.<br>
Furthermore, for the purpose of raising the coating property, various types of leveling agents may be incorporated as well. And for the purpose of imparting point contact electroresistance weldability, various types of metals such as iron, stainless steel, nickel, aluminum, and copper processed into a powder shape, flake<br>
shape, and filament shape, and a conductive filler such as carbon black, graphite, and carbon fiber may be incorporated as well.<br>
These components are preferably appropriately selected and incorporated in accordance with the purpose.<br><bondability gel fraction and heat resistance><br>
The viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention preferably has a T peel (peeling) strength after curing of not less than 70 N/25 mm when it is sandwiched between substrates made of metal as an intermediate layer. The gel fraction thereof preferably may become 50% or more.<br>
When the T peel strength is less than 70 N/25 mm, the layer becomes easy to peel due to bending and bend back processing, therefore workability cannot be obtained when it is used in a composite type vibration deadening material.<br>
Further, when the gel fraction is 50% or more, three-dimensional meshes having a high molecular chain necessary for preventing fluidity at a high temperature are formed, and the bonding strength and heat resistance are obtained, but when the gel fraction is less than 50%, there are many uncross-linked high molecular chains and the fluidity at a high temperature cannot be completely suppressed, therefore the bonding strength and the heat resistance become insufficient.<br>
Further, when the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention is used sandwiched as an intermediate layer between substrates made of metal, the retention rate cf the T peel strength before and after heating in hot water at 85°C for 72 hours is preferably 80% or more, further preferably 85% or more.<br>
When the retention rate is less than 80%, the possibility of a drop of the bondability when used for a long period in moist environment becomes high, so this not preferred.<br>
In the same way, when the viscoelastic resin<br>
composition of the present invention is used sandwiched as an intermediate layer between substrates made of metal, preferably the shear bonding strength after curing is 500 N/cm2 or more.<br>
When the shear bonding strength after curing is less than 500 N/cm2, peeling becomes easy due to bending and bend back processing, therefore workability cannot be obtained when used as a composite type vibration deadening material.<br>
Further, when the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention is used sandwiched as an intermediate layer between substrates made of metal, the retention rate of the T peel strength before and after heating at 240°C for 1 hour is preferably 80% or more, further preferably 85% or more.<br>
When the retention rate is less than 80%, the possibility of peeling becomes high when undergoing a heat treatment process such as baked coating and vulcanization after sealing becomes high, so is not preferred.<br><chromate-free bonding undercoat><br>
The chromate-free bonding undercoat used in the present invention is comprised of 5 mass% to 50 mass% of silica, 5 mass% to 50 mass! of polyester resin, 1 mass% to 50 mass% of tannic acid, and 0 mass% to 5 mass% of a silane coupling agent.<br><silica><br>
The silica component of the chromate-free bonding undercoat used in the present invention is effective in improvement of the bondability of the bonding undercoat with the metal sheet and improvement of the corrosion resistance.<br>
The silica used in the present invention may be either of colloidal silica or fumed silica. The mean grain size is preferably 1 u.m or less.<br>
The content of the silica in the chromate-free bonding undercoat is preferably 5 mass% to 50 mass% When<br>
it is less than 5 mass%, a sufficient durable bondability cannot be obtained, while when it exceeds 50 mass%, the coat becomes brittle, and the bondability when the resin-composite type vibration deadening material is processed becomes poor, so this not preferred.<br>
As examples of colloidal silica, there can be mentioned Snowtex 20 and Snowtex N made by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. As examples of fumed silica, there can be mentioned Aerosil 130, Aerosil TT600, Aerosil MOX80, etc. made by Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.<br><polyester resins><br>
The polyester resin component of the ch.romate-free bonding undercoat used in the present invention functions to improve the bondability between the binder of the silica component of the chromate bonding undercoat and the amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin of the viscoelastic resin composition.<br>
As the polyester resin, use may be made of a conventionally known water-soluble paint use polyester resin etc. A resin other than a polyester resin can also be used as the binder of the silica, but sometimes the bondability with the viscoelastic resin composition (amorphous copolymerizable polyester resin) of the present invention becomes low, therefore a polyester resin is preferred as the resin added to the chromate-free bonding undercoat agent used in the present invention .<br>
The content of the polyester resin in the chromate-free bonding undercoat is preferably 5 mass% to 50 mass%. When it is less than 5 mass%, the function as the binder of the silica is not exhibited and a sufficient bondability is not obtained, while when it exceeds 50 mass%, the durable bondability is rather lowered, so this is not preferred.<br>
As the acid component of the polyester resin, as an aromatic dicarbonate, there can be mentioned terephthalic acid, phthalic acid anhydride, naphthalene dicarbonate,<br>
etc. As an acidic component other than an aromatic dicarbonate, there can be mentioned aliphatic dicarbonate and alicyclic dicarbonate. These may be used alone or used in combinations of two or more types.<br>

As the diol component of the polyester resin, there can be mentioned ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, an ethylene oxide or a propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, etc.<br>
Further, preferably the polyester resin component of the chromate-free bonding undercoat used in the invention has a number average molecular mass of 7000 or more and a glass transition temperature of 0°C or more, whereby the strength of the chromate-free bonding undercoat becomes high.<br>
As a method of dispersing the polyester resin in water, use may be made of an emulsifier or other surfactant. Further, it is also possible to introduce a carboxyl group into the polyester resin and neutralize it by ammonia, amine, or the like to thereby impart the: water dispersion.<br>
Further, for the purpose of improving the film-forming property, a water-soluble organic solvent such as acetone, methylethylketone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dioxane, and isopropyl alcohol may be added to the water-dispersed polyester resin within a range of about 10 mass% or less.<br><tannic acid><br>
Tannic acid makes it possible for the bonding undercoat agent to achieve a higher bondability and durability when used together with silica.<br>
The content of the tannic acid in the chromate-free bonding undercoat used in the present invention is<br>
preferably 1 mass% to 50 mass%.<br>
When it is less than 1 mass%, the effect of the improvement of the bondability and the improvement of the corrosion resin is small, while when it exceeds 50 mass%, the curing of the viscoelastic resin composition used in the present invention is inhibited, although the exact reason is not clear, and the bondability is rather lowered, so this not preferred.<br>
The type of the tannic acid may be hydrolytic tannic acid or condensation type tannic acid or may be one obtained by partially decomposing them.<br>
The tannic acid is not particularly limited to hamamelitannic acid, gull nut tannic acid, gallic tannic acid, and catechin. Commercially available products can be used.<br><silane coupling agents><br>
The silane coupling agent may be added in an amount of 30 mass% or less as the component of the chromate-free bonding undercoat used in the present invention for the purpose of improving the bondability between the viscoelastic resin composition and the metal sheets.<br>
When the silane coupling agent is added exceeding 30 mass% of the total chromate-free bonding undercoat components, the chromate-free bonding undercoat becomes brittle, the bonding strength is sometimes lowered, and the silane coupling agent becomes easy to coagulate and solidify when preparing the chromate-free bonding undercoat agent, so this not preferred.<br>
As the silane coupling agent, preferably use is made of one having a functional group having reactivity with the resin. As such a silane coupling agent, there can be mentioned for example vinyl trichlorosilane,<br>
vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltris (ß methoxylethoxy) silane, (3- (3, 4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyItrimethoxysilane, y-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, y-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane, y-methacrylxypropyl-<br>

The pH of the chromate-free bonding undercoat agent used in the present invention is preferably within a range of 2 to 10. When the pH is less than 2, the substrate metal sheet is etched and the corrosion resistance is liable to drop, so this not preferred.<br>
On the other hand, when the pH exceeds 10, the possibility of a drop in the waterproof bondability of the viscoelastic resin composition due to an alkali component remaining in the coat is high, so this not preferred.<br>
The method of adjustment of the pH of the chrornate-<br>
free bonding undercoat agent used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but when adjusting it to the acid side, preferably use is made of for example an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, butylic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, L-ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, DL-malic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, and phthalic acid; a phosphoric acid such as metaphosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, triphosphoric acid, and tetraphosphoric acid; or a fluoride such as zirconium hydrofluoric acid, titanium hydrofluoric acid, silicofluoride, and hydrofluoric acid.<br>

method and then dried, then a viscoelastic resin composition is formed by a known method.<br>
As the method of coating the chromate-free bonding undercoat agent, for example, use can be made of the roll coater method, dipping method, electrostatic spraying method, and spray coating method.<br>
As the drying method after coating the chromate-free bonding undercoat agent, preferably the assembly is dried in a hot air drying oven, an infrared drying oven, an induction heating oven, or the like under the condition that the peak maximum temperature becomes about 80 to 150°C.<br><method of forming viscoelastic resin composition layer><br>

When press fixing it at a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature, a sufficient bondability is not obtained, so this not preferred.<br>
The resin-composite type vibration deadening material after the press fixing may be heat treated at a temperature of the glass transition temperature or more according to need. By adding the heat treatment after<br>
press fixing, the cross-linking of the viscoelastic resin layer is promoted, and the bonding strength is more stabilized, so this is preferred.<br>
Further, the composite type vibration deadening material of the present invention may have a multilayer structure of the other resin composition and the viscoelastic resin composition of the present invention according to need within the range not degrading the characteristics thereof.

(1)	Evaluation of gel fraction of viscoelastic resin<br>
composition<br>
A vibration deadening metal sheet having a coated sheet thickness of 0.5 mm and a resin layer thickness pf 50 µm was prepared, the vibration deadening sheet was peeled apart, then a part with film remaining on one side was cut into a 25 x 50 mm piece which was dipped in a solution of methylethylketone (MEK) for 3 minutes, them dried. The weight ratio of the resin was found by measuring the weight of the sample before and after dipping in MEK.<br>
(2)	Evaluation of bonding strength (initial T peejl<br>
strength) of viscoelastic resin composition<br>
A sample having a width of 25 mm and a length of 150 mm was cut from a vibration deadening metal sheet having a coated sheet thickness of 0.5 mm and a resin layer thickness of 50 µm. The T peel (peeling) strength when pulling the front and back steel sheets of the end parts of the sample a 180° direction was measured by using a tensile tester (tension compression tester STA-1150 made by Orientec) at a tensile rate of 50 mm/min and at a<br>
measurement temperature of 23°C.<br>
(3)	Evaluation of bonding strength (initial shear<br>
bonding strength) of viscoelastic resin composition<br>
A sample having a width of 25 mm and a length of 2,00 mm was cut from a vibration deadening metal sheet havirig a coated sheet thickness of 0.5 mm and a resin layer thickness of 50 µm. At the center of the sample, a superimposed portion of the front and back coated metal sheet layers having a length of 12.5 mm and a width of 25 mm for measuring the shear bonding strength was formed by using a microcutter or the like to cut a groove in the width direction of the front coated metal sheet layer of the vibration deadening metal sheet and to similarly cut a groove in the back coated metal sheet layer at a position 12.5 mm away from the groove of the front coating so'as to thereby prepare a shear bonding strength measurement sample.<br>
A length between grooves cut in the front and bacjc coated metal sheet layers of the prepared shear bonding strength measurement use sample and the width of the sample were measured by calipers, and an area of the superimposed portion of the front and back coated metal sheet layers is found.<br>
The two end portions of the sample for measuring the shear bonding strength is fixed to a sample holder of the tensile tester (Autograph AG-10KNE made by Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd.), then the tension load is measured at a tensile rate of 50 mm/min and at a measurement temperature of 23°C. The measured tension maximum load was divided by the area of the superimposed portion of the front and back coated metal sheet layers to find the bonding strength per unit area. This was used as the shear bonding strength.<br>
(4)	Evaluation of durable bondability (T peel<br>
strength after hot water treatment) of composite type<br>
vibration deadening material<br>
A sample having a width of 25 mm and a length of 1.50 mm was cut from a vibration deadening metal sheet having a coated sheet thickness of 0.5 mm and a resin layer thickness of 50 µm. The sample for measuring bondability was dipped in hot water of 85°C for 72 hours, then the bonding strength was measured by the same method as that for the initial T peel (peeling) strength.<br>
(5) Evaluation of durable bondability<br>
The initial T peel strength and the T peel strength after the hot water treatment were compared. The durable bondability was evaluated from the T peel strength retention rate.<br>
