COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION-10)<br>
AN IMPROVED TAMPER PROOF FUSION SEAL<br>
BALI RAVI KAMAL<br>
506-508.DIMPLE ARCADE,<br>
ASHA NAGAR, KANDIVALI (E),<br>
MUMBAI-400 101,<br>
MAHARASHTRA,<br>
INDIA.<br>
An Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner  in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
This invention relates generally to a tamper proof seal, particularly to an improved tamper proof seal for the drums with locking clamp and other similar closure systems where the big seals available in the market cannot be fitted due to narrow clamping arrangements and more particularly to an improved tamper proof fusion seal for the drums with locking clamp and other similar closure systems.<br>
Seals are required to shut or seal of outlet of the receptacles such as bottles, boxes, drums, container, wagons and the likes. The seals ensure that the receptacles are not tampered with in an unauthorized manner.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Seals and sealing devices are already known in the prior art.<br>
For instant Indian patent no. 150584 provides a sealing device comprising (i) a hollow receptacle having on its inner surface/s one or more ridges /teeth, with their edges facing down ward;(ii) an insert integrally connected to the hollow receptacle by a cord like portion having a hole in the middle and having ridges/teeth, with their edges pointing upward, such that when the said insert is pressed in to the aforesaid hollow receptacle the ridges/teeth of the insert interlock with the ridges/teeth of the hollow receptacle.<br>
Again, Indian patent no. 166770 provides an improved seal comprising:(l) a flat rectangular receptacle with a closed bottom but an open mouth having a pair of downwardly inclined teeth in the mid section of the said receptacle one each on it's two narrow sides, and at the bottom of the said receptacle there is provided at its centre a short vertical wedge whose incline planes face the aforesaid two narrow sides of the receptacle;(ii) a flat insert, integrally connected to the aforesaid receptacle by a cord, the said insert having at its top end a capping and an arrow shaped lower end, vertically slit up the centre forming two barbs which have a lateral springing movement.<br>
Similarly, Indian patent no. 166978 provides an improved positively dead lockable tamper proof seal comprising a casing having a catch means, said casing, being linked to a slidably fixable insert, by an extension cord or the like characterised in that said insert having positively dead lockable springy latch means and comprising a grip having an extension tongue with traverse slot at its front end for twisting a sealing wire or the like wound around a meter casing for sealing when said insert being slid within the said casing wherein the said springy latches yield during entry of said insert in to said casing and spring back to get positively dead<br><br>
locked to said catch means by snap action under thumb /pliers pressure applied there to.<br>
Further, Indian patent no. 172902 provides an improved sealing device comprising a hollow flat rectangular receptacle, closed at one end and open at the other, the inner surface of the walls of the receptacle defining a peripheral seat spaced apart from the closed end of the receptacle such that the inner space defined by the walls of receptacle is wider at the closed end and narrower at the mouth, a flat plunger type element defining a lid for covering the open end of the receptacle and a plunger body; and a resilient member for securing the plunger type element to the receptacle; characterized in that the said plunger body which is insertable in to the hollow receptacle, defines deformable diverging barbs on its side .which cooperates with the said seat defined in the walls of the receptacle such that in its operative configuration the plunger type element is easily insertable in to the receptacle by compressing the divergent barbs which barbs expand to their original form to engage the said seat when the plunger body reaches the closed end of the receptacle; and further characterized that a guide formation is provided on the plunger body to prevent play of the plunger type element in its operative configuration when it is inserted in the receptacle.<br>
There are some drawbacks in the existing seals, which are as follows:<br>
In almost all of the above seals the sealing wires are used, the sealing wire is passed through the locking clamp of the drum and inserted in to the locking mechanism of the seal. These seals are not pilfer proofed as the wire can be cut and the drum can be opened and subsequently, after the pilferage of the material, wire can be soldered in such a manner that no one make out that the drum was opened.<br>
There are some seals which are made of plastic and since the plastic is soluble in certain chemicals, the seals are being removed by applying same chemicals in which plastic is soluble and seals can be removed and after pilferage, adulteration again plastic seals can be resealed with the help of adhesive available in the market.<br>
Also these plastic seals can be cut with the sharp blade sidewise and seal can come out and again after pilferage and adulteration the same seal can be joined with the help of adhesive available in the market.<br>
There are some seals made with a metal named TECH-LOCK which is claimed to be the ultimate in sealing the drum but have some limitations due to improper quality of clamps of the ring, non matching of the grooves in the locking clamp, improper size of grooves with the various drum manufacturers.<br><br>
There are another metal seal called TM-LOCK made with two metal pieces which are locked through this seal is an ultimate but expensive.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks in the prior art and to provide an improved tamper proof seal for locking the drums with locking clamp and other similar closure systems<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a tamper proof seal, which is relatively cheaper than the metal seals i.e. TECH-LOCK &amp; TM-LOCK for drums.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved tamper proof seal, which once locked in proper position can not be removed except by cutting or breaking, thereby leaving clear evidence to naked eye, and thus making the seal 100% tamper-proof.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide an improved tamper proof seal, which once locked in proper position does not provide any chances of manoeuvrability from the lower end of the clamp.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide an improved tamper proof seal, where a springy metal frame is put on a groove provided in one member so as to reduce the chances of cutting the seal sidewise and also defects during manufacturing.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide an improved tamper proof seal, which cannot be opened by heating, any soluable solvent, by any sharp tool or by cutting apart sidewise.<br>
Further objects and advantages of my invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
Referring to the drawings, 1,2 and 3 a locking clamp ring 40 for drum or other similar closures is shown. In figure 2 the locking clamp is closed and in fig 3 a prior art seal is shown inserted in the groove of the clamp.<br>
Referring to figures 4 to 11, the tamper proof fusion seal comprises of the hollow flat rectangular receptacle 10, which consists of two members 11 and 12   attached with each other at 13 The members 11 an 12 when folded at 13 and snap fitted with each other forms the hollow flat rectangular receptacle 10.The receptacle is closed at bottom end and having an opening 14 at the top. The inner surface of the walls of the receptacle defines a space 15 where a metal frame 16 is encased. The metal spring defines a peripheral seat 17 spaced apart from the closed end of the receptacle. There is a lug 18 and a gap 19 provided on each of the said members such that when two members are folded the lug 18 a of one member remains above the lug 18 b of the other members and fit in to the gaps of each other such as 18 a fits in to 19 b and 18 b fits into 19 a.   Thus a channel 20 co-axial to the top opening of the receptacle is formed. One member 11 is provided with projections 21a and 21 b and the other member provided with complementary grooves 22 a and 22 b for snap fitting of the both members.<br>
It can be appreciated that the projections on one member and the complementary grooves on other members can be on the side walls or on the lug and the wall of the gap respectively.<br>
There is a flat insert 23. The insert has at its top end a capping 24.lt has a shaft 25 at its bottom end in the middle and a pair of compressible<br><br>
flukes 26 on its both sides of the shaft. There is a hole 27 in the middle of the shaft.<br>
There are another pair of flukes 27,one on each narrow side of the insert 23 and a pair of upwardly inclined steps 28, one on each broad side of the insert provided at a desired distant below the capping 24 such that when the flat insert is made to pass through the groove of locking clamp after closing the drum ring of a drum, the flukes 26 and 27 of the insert get compressed and slip through and the flukes 27 lock with the inner top of the locking clamp in X-X direction and the inclined steps 28 lock with the inner top of the locking clamp in Y-Y direction and when the receptacle is moved upward the flukes 26 of the insert is compressed and slipped through the channel 20 defined inside the receptacle and the narrow passage made by the metal spring below it, the said flukes then cooperates with the said seat 17 defined by the metal frame.<br>
In one of the preferred embodiment the receptacle further includes a groove 29 parallel to the inner side walls of one member and below the gap 19 defining a space where the metal spring 16 is put and a wall 30 besides the said groove providing further support for the metal spring. It can be appreciated that by providing the groove the metal spring will cover substantial part of the thickness of the seal. So it will be extremely difficult for some one to cut the seal through with a sharp tool without damaging substantially the seal. If ever it is cut through it can't be fixed as original with glue or adhesive. Another advantage can be appreciated during manufacturing where there will be virtual no chance of misplacement during induction welding.<br>
In this invention the insert and the receptacles are made of plastic so cheaper.<br><br>
In this invention the receptacle is welded by induction welding to make a strong bonding between the metal frame and the receptacle.<br>
In this invention the insert can be of various types.<br>
In one embodiment of the insert upper pair of flukes 27 (fig 17,17 a and 17 b) are diverging more from the main shaft to provide more springy action to the flukes.<br>
In another embodiment (fig 16,16 a and 16 b) the upper pair of flukes is diverging away from each other in Y-Y direction so when locked and pulled away from top they abut with the metal clamp in Y-Y direction too. It can be appreciated that in this case the pair of upwardly inclined steps, one on each broad side of the insert may be absent.<br>
The insert can be made of transparent material.<br>
The receptacle can be made of transparent material.<br>
The receptacle can be of different colours or combination of colours.<br>
In one typical case the receptacle and the insert is of same colour or forms a particular combination of colour.<br>
The outer surface of the receptacle can be embossed with an identifying number and/or mark or logo of the user.<br>
The top surface of the capping of the insert is embossed with an identifying number and/or mark of the user.<br>
The bottom surface of the capping has a channel 31 to allow a passage of thread so that when sealed the bottom surface of the seal completely abuts with the top surface of the metal clamp (does not remain raised so as to allow sharp knife).<br>
In a most preferred embodiment the length of the shaft of insert is such that the top of the receptacle closes the bottom of the groove of the clamp ring.<br>
When I have described and illustrated particular embodiment of my present invention I do not wish to limit myself to the exact form shown which is indeed to illustrate my invention rather than to limit to it.<br><br>
It is to be expressly understood that the invention is susceptible to such improvements and modifications, which may be made by any person skilled in the art to suit individual job requirement and any such improvements and modifications so made in the seal here in before described and illustrated shall be considered to be falling within the ambit and scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br>
Advantages:<br>
1 .It is absolutely and totally tamper proof and it cannot be opened, without breaking or deforming the seal.<br>
2As the hollow receptacle has thick vertical walls, it cannot be compressed to unlock.<br>
