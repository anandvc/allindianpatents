				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invented fuel gas was prepared in closed container under pressure by burning pine waste and heating the fuel with the help of compressed air which produced gas inside the container. This gas was passed under high pressure at 5 kg through chemical chambers where it reacted with chemical materials and finally the invented fuel gas was produced. This process requires 400° to 500° C temperature.<br>
This invented apparatus is mainly made of three parts:--<br>
First part consists of big drum, second part consists of small drum and third part contains chemical material which lies in the above mentioned big drum and small drum and all the chemical reactions take place in it. There are two blower operated Kiln under the big drum and small drum for heating third part and ignite the fire after filling the pine waste material like leaf, fruit, root, bark and stem in the big drum and heat upto four-six hours. We maintain the temperature upto 400°-500° C with the help of blower. After then we close the opening of the container of big drum and then we start supplying air by compressor which produces the gas after burning of the pine waste and the produced gas in the container is passed through chemical material. The gas comes out from the plant as the fuel gas which caught fire by showing flame or electric ignition and this fuel gas can be used in engine and gas turbines.<br><br>
The present invention relates to fuel gas from pine forest waste used preferably as a fuel gas in Petrol engine, diesel engine and gas turbine etc.<br>
Aim of the invention is to protect forest by properly using the pine forest waste material and at the same time to make fuel gas. This fuel can be used for industrial purposes with the help of petrol and diesel engines. At the same time for the production of electricity by using gas turbine. This can be used to clean the environment by saving the forest from fire. This invention is employment generated for making fuel gas from pine forest waste material.<br>
Prior Art<br>
There are two methods available for the production of gases which can be used as fuel from poorest quality materials. One is Producer gas and another is Gasifire. Aromatic hydrocarbon and tar are found in less quantity in the fuels used in above two methods. Therefore the gases produced from the method of Producer and Gasifire does not deposit tar and carbon but an aromatic hydrocarbon and tar are found in higher percentage in pine forest waste. Tar and carbon are deposited in pine forest waste during burning. Therefore pine forest waste can not be used in Producer and Gasifire. The gases which are produced from Producer and Gasifire are mixture of carbon monoxide and<br><br>
hydrogen but the invented gases are the mixture of cycloxane, methane, ethane, hydrogen etc. Producer and Gasifire does not require catalytic material but in our invented process require catalytic chamber.<br>
The coal prepared from leaves and other material of pine forest waste is of low quality in comparison to wood coal and natural mine coal.<br>
The Resin(Lisa), turpentine oil ( C10H16 ) and tar are produced from Pine forest. The fractionation of resin produced benzene ( C6H6), phenol( C6H5OH ). At high temperature, phenols react with Zn to produce benzene The hydrogenation of benzene in presence of nickel powder produced cyclohexane ( C6H12).<br>
The fuel in producer and gasifire produce mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen but in the invented process, pine waste material produce cyclohexane which is better fuel than carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In the invented process resin and tar are completely converted in gaseous form. Therefore this invented gas can be used in petrol and diesel engine and also in gas turbine.<br>
Other objects and advantages of this invention will be better understood from the following description and accompanying drawing wherein:--<br><br>
Figure 1. shows side view of apparatus .<br>
Figure 2.    shows side view and sectional view of chemical container.<br>
Figure 3.  shows side view and sectional view of air compressor and air capacitor.<br>
Figure 4. shows the longitudinal sectional view of complete apparatus.<br>
Description of Figures:--<br>
Figure number 1 has one vertical hollow big drum and horizontal hollow small drum number 22 connected to each other. Number 20 is Kiln for heating inner parts of big drum number 1 and similarly, number 21 is Kiln for heating inner part of small drum number 22. We load pine bark and Coal as fuel to Kiln number 22 through the opening number 9 and similarly we do the same with Kiln number 21 from the gate number 15 and we supply air with the help of blower number 6 through pipe number 11. But the air in Kiln number 21 is controlled by valve number 16. Chimney number 10(1) and 10(2) are for to exhaust the gases and smoke from big drum number 1 and small drum number 22. Now big drum number 1 has two pine waste charging gates number 7(1) for pine leaf (Pirul) and 7(2) for pine bark, root etc.<br><br>
The big drum has two elbow gates number 8(1) and 8(2) for atmospheric air and these elbow gates are also connected with compressor number 4 through pipe number 12. In the situation when elbow gate number 8(1) and 8(2) are closed then we give the compressed air through compressor number 4.<br>
Figure number 2 shows side view and longitudinal sectional view of chemical container.<br>
In this side view number 2 and 3 indicate vertical container and horizontal container respectively which are connected to each other through pipe and pipe number 26 is for gases from big drum number 1. The vertical container number 2 is divided into two parts number 24 and 25. The pipe number 27 having hemisphere cap on the top starts from middle of the part number 2 to the middle of the part number 25. Part number 25 contains nickel (Ni) powder. The Part number 24 contains zinc (Zn) powder and coke. Part number 25 and part number 3 are connected by pipe. Part number 3 contains Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni) powder.<br>
Figure number 3 shows side view and side sectional of hand operated compressor.<br>
Here number 4 shows the hand operated compressor and air starts filling inside, by pushing up and down the compressor by<br><br>
hand. Number 5 shows air capacitor in which we supply air from compressor number 4 and we supply air as per weight number 19 on the capacitor.<br>
Water as shown in number 4 is filled in side view sectional of compressor number 4. The compressor number 4 and capacitor number 5 are connected by pipe whose ends are above the filed water in compressor and capacitor having an non-return valve number 13(2). The non-return valve number 13(1) allowed the atmospheric air inside compressor number 4 and similarly nonreturn valve number 13(3) allowed air from capacitor to big drum number 1 through pipe number 12 leveled above water filed in capacitor number 5.<br>
Figure number 4 shows side view section of the complete plant showing blower, compressor, chemical container, big drum, small drum etc.<br>
Figure number 17 is a long pipe used for pushing pine waste leaf (pirul) through opening number 7(1) so that it could reach upto lattice number 23(1). The lattice number 23(1) and 23(2) are fitted on the two end of the elbow number 8(1) and 8(2) inside the big drum number 1. There is also an gate for removing the ash.<br><br>
Working of the invention.<br>
First of ail we open elbow number 8(1) and 8(2) of the drum number 1 for air and also we open the gate number 9 filing with coal and pine bark inside the Kiln number 20 and also at the same time fill Kiln number 21 through opening number 15 with bark and coal, and also we fill the drum number 1 with leaf through opening number 7(1) and also filled with bark, bruit, roots etc. through opening number 7(2). And at last we give fire to Kiln number 20, Kiln number 21, drum number 1 and drum number 22. Now we slowly heat the apparatus for four-six hours. Now we closed the opening number 8(1), 8(2), 7(1) and 7(2) after warming up the apparatus and supply air through the blower and compressor. We maintain temperature upto 400°-500°C in both Kiln number 20 and 21. And at last Invented fuel gas comes out from opening number 18 which caught fire after showing flame or ignition. Time to time we fill drum number 1 with pirul through opening number 7(1).<br>
Chemicals Reactions:—<br>
Different type of gases are produced after heating and burning the pine waste:-<br>
By heating the pine forest waste in big drum number 1 by Kiln number 20 and maintaining the temperature 400°-500° C. Turpine oil and tar will change in vapour form in limited supply of oxygen/air in drum number 1 and at the same time in this condition carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (C02), methane (<br><br>
CH4) and hydrogen (H2) will be formed in large quantity. Water is found in large quantity in tar.<br>
Resin will be converted into turpine oil and tar after heating the pine waste in drum number 1 Turpine oil will be converted into benzene, ethane, ethylene and tar will be converted into phenol (C6H5OH) by the fractionation. All the gases as mentioned in above like methane, benzene, ethane, ethylene, phenol, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and steam will pass in container number 24 and out of these compounds phenol, carbon dioxide, stem will react with zinc and coke and will be converted into benzene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen respectively. Which further increased the percentage of benzene and carbon monoxide. All the gases like methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, benzene, ethane, ethylene will pass through pipe number 27 and will react with hydrogen in presence of nickel powder in container no. 25. Benzene, ethylene, carbon monoxide will react with hydrogen to produce cyclohexane, ethane and methane respectively. Now the available gases cyclohexne, ethane, methane, steam in container no. 25 will pass in container number 3 and steam will react with zinc and copper in container number 3. Now the available gases cyclohexane, ethane, methane and hydrogen in container number 3 will be refined in process of addition reaction in presence of nickel powder which lies in container number 3. And finally our invented fuel gas is of the composition of gases cyclohexane ( C6H12 ), ethane (C2H6),<br><br>
methane ( CH4) and hydrogen (H2). And this invented gas caught fire by showing the flame or electric ignition<br>
Invented Fuel Gas :-    Invented fuel gas is    Mixture of Cyclohexane  Ethane, Methane and Hydrogen gases<br>
Properties of this invented fuel gas:—<br>
1.	Gas caught fire in presence of flame.<br>
2.	Gas caught fire by electric ignition.<br>
3.	Gas soluble in organic compound like, acetone, petrol,<br>
alcohol etc.<br>
4.	After burning the gas it is free from carbon deposit.<br>
5.	This gas will be used only in hot condition.<br>
Although this invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment thereof, certain modifications variations may take place without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as those skilled in art will readily understand.<br>
The above mentioned modification and variations shall be considered as falling with in the scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br><br>
