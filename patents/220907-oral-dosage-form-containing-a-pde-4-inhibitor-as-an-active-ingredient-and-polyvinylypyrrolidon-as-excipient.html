GRANTED<br><br>
15-04-2008<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical technology and describes a dosage form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor as active ingredient jn tablet or pellet form for treating diseases such as asthma or airway obstructions. The invention additionally relates to processes for producing the dosage form.<br>
Prior art<br>
Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (specifically of type 4) are currently of special interest as a new generation of active ingredients for treating inflammatory disorders, especially inflammations of the airways such as asthma or airway obstructions (such as, for example, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A number of PDE 4 inhibitors is currently undergoing advanced clinical testing.<br>
In WO00/50011 and WO01/32165, which relate to dosage forms with controlled or sustained delivery of a PDE 4 inhibitor, It is pointed out that unwanted CNS side effects may become manifest on delivery of certain PDE 4 inhibitors such as Ariflo® (INN: cilomilast) in higher dosages. WOOO/50011 and WO01/32165 see this as being a particular risk with immediate release dosage forms of the active ingredient and therefore propose administering the PDE 4 inhibitor Ariflo® (INN: cilomilast) In dosage forms with controlled or sustained release.<br>
US 5,286,494 proposes a dosage form with controlled or sustained release for the PDE 4 inhibitor Rolipram whose solubility is slight. However, production of dosage forms with controlled or sustained release of slightly soluble active ingredients may be technically complicated, reference being made thereto for example in US 5,286,494.<br>
The solubility of active ingredients of the PDE 4 inhibitor class in water and aqueous systems may, depending on the chemical structure, be low. Thus, the solubility fh water found for the PDE 4 inhibitor N"(3,5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)-3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-dlfluoromethoxybenzamide (INN: roflumilast), which Is described in WO95/01338, is only 0.53 mg/l at 21 °C. The bioavailability of a medicinal substance depends essentially on the release of the medicinal substance from the pharmaceutical form. Faster release and dissolution of the medicinal substance from the formulation means faster absorption thereof. With medicinal substances which are slightly soluble in water, therefore, the bioavailability is frequently limited by the solubility or rate of dissolution. This makes it very difficult to produce suitable dosage forms.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a dosage form for oral administration of P#E 4 inhibitors whose solubility is slight, which form can be produced without great technical complexity, which takes account of the low solubility of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, and which results in rapid, acceptable bioavailability of the POE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, so as to attain serum levels which are required in order to obtain the desired pharmacological effect quickly without side effects becoming manifest.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that this object can be achieved by a dosage form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, employing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as binder for the dosage form. Compared with dosage forms in which no PVP is employed as binder, the dosage form of the invention shows distinctly improved pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, in particular in relation to the bioavailability of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, a faster absorption and thus faster onset of the pharmacological effect is observed with the dosage forms of the invention compared with dosage forms without PVP. The^ oral, dosage form of the Invention is preferably a solid dosage form in tablet or pellet form. It is preferably a solid oral dosage form with immediate release of the active ingredient (immediate release solid oral dosage form).<br>
The invention therefore relates to a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, comprising the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight together with polyvinylpyrrolidone as binder, and one or more other suitable pharmaceutical excipients.<br>

PVP of higher molecular weight such as, for example, Kollidon 25, Kollidon 30 and Kollidon 90 F may be mentioned as preferred.<br>
it is possible if desired to employ in addition to PVP other binders such as polyvinyl acetate (e.g. Kollidon® VA 64), gelatin, corn starch mucilage, preswollen starches (Starch 1500), hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) or hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC).<br>
Fillers suitable according to the invention are fillers such as calcium carbonate (e.g. MagGran® CC or Destab® 95) and sodium carbonate, sugar alcohols such as mannitol (e.g. Perlitol® or Parteck® M), sorbitol (e.g. Karion®), xylitol or maltltol, starches such as corn starch, potato starch and wheat starch, microcrystailine cellulose, saccharides such as glucose, lactose (e.g. lactose monohydrate), tevutase, sucrose and dextrose. It is also possible if desired to use mixtures thereof. Corn starch, microcrystailine cellulose and lactose may be mentioned as preferred.<br>
Examples of suitable lubricants and release agents which may be mentioned are sodium stearyl fumarate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, talc and colloidal anhydrous silica (Aerosil).<br>
Disintegrants suitable according to the invention are, in particular, insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (insoluble PVP, crospovidone), carboxymethylstarch sodium [= sodium starch glycolatej, sodium carboxymethyfcellulose, alglnlc acid, and starches able to carry out the function of a disintegrant (e.g. Starch 1500).<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of PDE 4 inhibitor in the dosage form of the invention is usually, depending on the nature of the PDE 4 inhibitor, from 0.01 to 50% by weight. The proportion of PDE 4 inhibitor is preferably up to 20% by weight.<br>
" The proportion (In percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of binder (PVP and, where appropriate, other binders) may preferably be according to the Invention from 0.5 to 20% by weight. The<br><br>
proportion of PVP is preferably from 1 to 5% by weight, particularly preferably 2 to 3% by weight.<br>
The proportion (In percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of filler in the tablet of the invention is advantageously from 40 to 99% by weight. The proportion of filler is preferably from 60 to 97% by weight.<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of disintegrant in the rapidly<br>
disintegrating tablet can usually be up to 35% by weight. The proportion of disintegrant is preferably<br>
from 2 to 20% by weight. The proportion of disintegrant is particularly preferably from 5 to 10% by<br>
weight.	~~~-"~"<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of lubricant or release agent in the rapidly disintegrating tablet Is usually from 0.1 to 5% by weight. The proportion of lubricant or release agent Is preferably from 0.3 to 3% by weight. The proportion of lubricant or release agent is particularly preferably from 0.5 to 2% by weight.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dosage form Is a tablet. It is preferred for the tablet,    \ besides the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight and PVP, to comprise as further pharmaceutical   \ excipients at least one filler and at least one lubricant or release agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation of the invention can be produced by processes known to the skilled worker for producing tablets and pellets.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical form of the invention is produced by producing a solid solution of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight in the binder PVP as carrierjhis can take place for example by the solvent method in which PVP, the PDE 4 inhibitor and, where appropriate, other pharmaceutical excipients are dissolved in a suitable solvent, and the solvent is subsequently removed again by spray drying, normal drying, vacuum drying or freeze-drying. It has been found, surprisingly, that production of the solid solution is also possible by the mixing method in which a PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight and, where appropriate, other pharmaceutical excipients are vigorously mixed together with PVP.<br>
The invention also relates further to a solid solution of a PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility Is slight in the binder PVP as carrier. A solid solution of the PDE 4 inhibitor in the binder PVP as carrier means according to the invention a solid solution with amorphous structure in which the PDE 4 inhibitor is in the form of a molecular dispersion in the carrier material.<br>
In the event of further processing of a solid solution to tablets or pellets, the solid solution may be processed as active ingredient component together with the filler, binder, disintegrant and lubricant<br><br>
components by production processes familiar to the skilled worker to give the oral dosage forms of the invention.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a process for producing a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor, comprising the steps: (a) production of an active ingredient preparation in the form of a solid solution in PVP of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight,<br>
(b)	production of a mixture of an active ingredient preparation and pharmaceutical excfpients and<br>
(c)	granulation of the mixture obtained in (b) with an aqueous solution of PVP.<br>
In the case of dosage forms of the invention in the form of tablets, the granules obtained in (c) can, after drying and mixing with lubricants or release agents, be compressed in a tablet press. In the case of dosage forms of the invention in the form of pellets, the wet granules obtained in (c) can be processed by the extruder/spheroidizer process to suitable pellets. Alternatively, dispersions/suspensions of an active ingredient preparation can be applied in the form of a solid solution in PVP of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight in a suitable solvent to pellet-like carriers (e.g. nonpareils or HPMC-containing pellets).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the dosage form of the invention is produced by granulating a mixture of active ingredient and pharmaceutical excipients with an aqueous PVP solution, drying the granules and, if desired, admixing other pharmaceutical excipients. Wet preparations obtained after granulation can then be further processed to pellets and can subsequently be packed into capsules. Dried granules can - if desired after admixture of other pharmaceutical excipients - after mixing with a release agent be compressed in a tablet press. The granulation preferably takes place in a fluidized bed granulator under suitable conditions. It is moreover possible if desired for the active ingredient to be admixed to the other pharmaceutical excipients in the form of a trituration with a pharmaceutical excipient (especially a filler). This is particularly preferred when the active ingredient content in the dosage form is less than 5% by weight. Such a trituration can normally be obtained by "grinding the active Ingredient with a pharmaceutical excipient (especially a filler).<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a process for producing a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor comprising the steps:<br>
(a)	production of a mixture of active ingredient and pharmaceutical excipients and<br>
(b)	granulation of the mixture obtained in (a) with an aqueous solution of PVP.<br>
The dosage form of the invention Is particularly preferably produced by granulation of a mixture of<br>
(a)   PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, or a trituration of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight with com starch,<br><br>
(b)	corn starch and<br>
(c)	lactose monohydrate<br>
with an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press. The PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight is in this case particularly preferably roflumilast, the salts thereof, the N-oxide of the pyridine and salts thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the dosage form of the invention is particularly preferably produced by granulation of a mixture of<br>
. (a)   PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, or a trituration of the PDE 4 Inhibitor whose solubility is slight with corn starch,<br>
(b)	corn starch,<br>
(c)	microcrystalline cellulose and<br>
(d)	sodium carboxymethylstarch<br>
with an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press. The PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight is in this case particularly preferably roflumilast, the salts thereof, the N-oxide of the pyridine and salts thereof.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the dosage form of the invention is produced by granulation of a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients with a suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules and, if desired, admixture of further pharmaceutical excipients. The preparations obtained in this way can then, after mixing with a release agent, be compressed in a tablet press. The granulation preferably takes place in a fluidized bed granulator under suitable conditions.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a process for producing a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor comprising the steps:<br>
(a)	production of a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients and<br>
(b)	granulation of the mixture obtained in (a) with a suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous solution of PVP,<br>
The dosage form of the invention is particularly preferably produced by granulation of a mixture of corn starch and lactose monohydrate with a suspension of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight in an aqueous solution of PVP, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press.<br><br>
it has surprisingly been found that dosage forms of the invention produced employing physical mixtures or triturations of the PDE 4 Inhibitor whose solubility is slight with a filler (e.g. by grinding, vigorous mixing or extrusion) and subsequent granulation with aqueous PVP solutions, or produced employing granulation suspensions of PDE 4 inhibitors in aqueous PVP solutions, have similar advantageous properties in relation to the bioavailability of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight as do dosage forms produced by first producing solid solutions of PVP and PDE 4 inhibitor. This suggests that in the production of the dosage forms of the Invention based on physical mixtures or triturations of the PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight with a filler, which are subsequently granulated with aqueous PVP solutions, or in whose preparation granulation suspensions of PDE 4 inhibitors in aqueous PVP solutions are employed, there are, surprisingly, interactions between PVP and PDE 4 inhibitor whose solubility is slight, like those occurring in the solid solution of PVP and PDE 4 inhibitor. In the production of the dosage forms of the invention it is therefore also possible to dispense with the more technically elaborate variant of production of a solid solution by the solvent method.<br>

Industrial applicability<br>
The dosage forms of the invention can be employed for the treatment and prevention of all diseases regarded as treatable or preventable through the use of PDE 4 Inhibitors. Selective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (specifically of type 4) are suitable on the one hand as bronchial therapeutic agents (for the treatment of airway obstructions owing to their dilating effect but also owing to their effect increasing the respiratory rate and respiratory drive) and for eliminating erectile dysfunction owing to the vasodilating effect, but on the other hand especially for the treatment of disorders, especially of an inflammatory nature, e.g. of the airways (asthma prophylaxis), of the skin, of the central nervous system, of the intestine, of the eyes and of the joints, which are promoted by mediators such as histamine, PAF (platelet-activating factor), arachfdonte acid derivatives such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, cytokines, interleukins, chemokines, alpha-, beta- and gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or oxygen free radicals and proteases. The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can therefore be used in human and veterinary medicine for example for the treatment and prophylaxis of the following diseases: acute and chronic (especially inflammatory and allergen-induced) airway disorders of various etiologies (bronchitis, allergic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, COPD); dermatoses (especially of a proliferative, inflammatory and allergic nature) such as, for example, psoriasis (vulgaris), toxic and allergic contact eczema, atopic eczema, seborrhoic eczema, lichen simplex, sunburn, pruritus in the genitoanal region, alopecia areata, hypertrophic scars, discoid lupus erythematosus, follicular and extensive pyodermas, endogenous and exogenous acne, acne rosacea and other proliferative, inflammatory and allergic skin disorders; disorders based on excessive release of TNF an leukotrienes, e.g. disorders of the arthritic type (rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic states), disorders of the immune system (AIDS, multiple sclerosis), types of shock [septic shock, endotoxin shock, gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome)] and generalized inflammations in the gastrointestinal region (Crohn"s disease and ulcerative colitis); disorders based on allergic and/or chronic abnormal immunological reactions in the region of the upper airways (pharyngeal space, nose) and adjacent regions (paranasal sinuses, eyes), such as, for example, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, chronic rhinitis/sinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis and nasal polyps; but also cardiac disorders which can be treated by PDE inhibitors, such as, for example, heart failure, or disorders which can be treated owing to the tissue-relaxant effect of PDE inhibitors, such as, for example, erectile dysfunction or colic of the kidneys and ureters connected with kidney stones; or else disorders of the CNS such as, for example, depressions or arteriosclerotic dementia.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the treatment of mammals, including humans, suffering from one of the abovementioned diseases. The method is characterized by administration of a therapeutically effective and pharmacologically suitable amount of a PDE 4 inhibitor to the mammalian patient, the PDE 4 inhibitor being present in a dosage form of the invention. The disease is preferably asthma or airway obstructions, especially COPD (= chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).<br><br>
The dosage forms of the invention comprise the PDE 4 inhibitor in the dose customary for the treatment of the particular disease. The dosage of the active ingredient is of the order of magnitude customary for PDE inhibitors, it being possible to administer the daily dose in one or more dosage units. The normal dose on systemic therapy (oral) is between 0.001 mg and 3 mg per kilogram and day. Dosage forms preferred according to the invention contain from 0.01 mg to 5 mg of roflumilast, preferably from 0.05 mg to 2.5 mg, particularly preferably 0.1 mg to 0.5 mg of roflumilast per dosage unit Examples of pharmaceutical preparations of the invention contain 0.1 mg, 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg of roflumilast per dosage unit. Normally, one or more than one dosage unit of the invention Is administered once a day. If desired, it is also possible for one or more dosage units of the invention to be administered more than once a day.<br><br>
