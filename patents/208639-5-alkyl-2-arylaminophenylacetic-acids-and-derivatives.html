CERTAIN 5-ALKYL-2-ARYLAMiNOPHENYLACETIC ACIDS AND DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to 5-all<yl-2-arylaminophenylacetlc acids and derivatives thereof as defined herein which are particularly potent selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors methods for preparation phamiaceutical compositions comprising said compounds of selectively inhibiting cox-2 activity treating conditions in mammals responsive to inhibition using or the invention.></yl-2-arylaminophenylacetlc>
Various substituted 2-arylaminophenylacetic acids and derivatives thereof have been disclosed e.g. in J. Med. Chem. 33, 2358 (1990), U.S. patents 3,558,690, 3,652,762, 4,173,577 and 4,548.952, DE 3445011. And in PCT applications WO 97/09977 and WO 96/00716 as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. As to 5-alkyl-2-arylaminophenylacetic acids, the only example known to be described In the literature is 5-methyl-2-(2,6-dimethylanilino)-phenylacetic acid and Its sodium salt (U.S. patent 3,558,690) for which no biological data has been reported.<br>
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenase is now known to comprise a constitutive isoform (cyclooxygenase-1, COX-1) and an inducible isoform (cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2), COX-1 appears responsible for protective beneficial features of prostaglandins, e.g. for the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc., while the inducible isoform COX-2 appears responsible for pathological conditions associated with prostaglandins, such as inflammatory conditions. A limitation to the use of classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs including diclofenac sodium which is the sodium salt of 2,6-dichloroanilinophenylacetic acid) is gastrointestinal toxicity now attributed to the inhibition of the COX-1 isoform of cyclooxygenase. Selective inhibition of inducible COX-2 in vivo has been reported to be antiinflammatory and non-acrogenic (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 1994; 91:3228-3232).<br>
The present invention provides novel 5-alkyl substituted 2-arylaminophenylacetic acids and derivatives which surprisingly inhibit COX-2 without significantly inhibiting COX-1. The invention thus provides novel nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents which are surprisingly free<br><br>
of undesirable side effects usually associated with the classical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, such as gastrointestinal and renal side effects.<br>

The general definitions used herein have the following meaning within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters are ester derivatives which are convertible by<br>
solvolysis or under physiological conditions to the free carboxylic acids of formula I. Such<br>
esters are e.g. lower alkyl esters (such as the methyl or ethyl ester), carboxy-lower alkyl esters<br>
such as the carboxymethyl ester, nitrify-lower alkyl esters (such as the 4-nitrooxybutyl ester),<br>

A lower alkyl group contains up to 7 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms and represents for example methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, and may be straight chain or branched.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are particularly useful or may be metabolically converted to compounds which are particularly useful as COX-2 selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors. They are thus particularly useful for the treatment of cyclooxygenase dependent<br><br>
disorders in mammals, including inflammation, pyresis, pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine headache, neurodegenerative diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, asthma, lupus and psoriasis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are further useful for the treatment of neoplasia particularly neoplasia that produce prostaglandins or express cyclooxygenase, including both benign and cancerous tumors, growths and polyps. Compounds of the present invention may be employed for the treatment of any neoplasia as for example recited in Imitational Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/16227, published 23 April 1998, in particular epithelium cell-derived neoplasia. Compounds of the present invention are in particular useful for the treatment of liver, bladder, pancreas, ovarian, prostate, cervical, lung and breast cancer and, especially gastrointestinal cancer, for example cancer of the colon, and skin cancer, for example squeamish cell or basal cell cancers and melanoma.<br>
The tenure "treatment as used herein is to be understood as including both therapeutic and prophylactic modes of therapy, e.g. in relation to the treatment of neoplasia, therapy to prevent the onset of clinically or prolifically evident neoplasia, or for the prevention of initiation of malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant to malignant cells, as well as the prevention or inhibition of neoplasia growth or metastasis. In this context, the present invention is, in particular, to be understood as embracing the use of compounds of the present invention to inhibit or prevent development of skin cancer, e.g. squanders or basal cell carcinoma consequential to UV light exposure, e.g. resultant from chronic exposure to the sun.<br>
The compounds of the invention have activity in the above indications while substantially avoiding undesirable gastrointestinal ulceration associated with conventional cyclooxygenase<br>
inhibitors.<br>

The compounds of the invention may also be used in ocular applications which include the treatment of ocular disorders, in particular of ocular inflammatory disorders, of ocular pain<br><br>
including pain associated with ocular surgery such as PRK or cataract surgery, of ocular allergy, of photophobia of various etiology, of elevated interlobular pressure (in glaucoma) by inhibiting the production of orbicular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response (TIGR) protein, and of dry eye disease.<br>
The above-cited properties are demonstrable in vitro and in vivo tests using advantageously mammals, e.g. rats, mice, dogs, monkeys and isolated cells or enzyme preparations thereof. Said compounds can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g. aqueous solutions, and in vivo advantageously orally, topically or parenterally, e.g. intravenously. The dosage in vitro may range from about 10"Â® to 10'Â® molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 1 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
Cyclooxygenase inhibition is determined in vitro using cellular assays for inhibition of both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
The cellular assays for testing cyclooxygenase inhibitors are based on the fact that the cyclooxygenase enzyme (prostaglandin H synthase) catalyzes the rate limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Two enzymes mediate the reaction: COX-1 is a constitutive forms of the enzyme whereas COX-2 is induced in response to various growth factors and cytokines. Cell lines have been established which express one form of the enzyme: a human skin fibroblast line which can be induced with IL-1 to synthesize COX-2, and the kidney epithelial cell line 293 which has been stably transfected to constitutively express COX-1. Both isoforms metabolize arachidonic into the stable metabolite prostaglandin E2. Arachidonic acid can be added exogenously to increase output to easily measurable levels. The levels of prostaglandin E2 in the extracellular medium are assayed by radioimmunoassay as a measure of enzyme activity. The relative activities of each isonomy are compared to assess compound selectivity.<br>
In vitro cvclooxvoenase-l (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition is determined in the cell-based assays in order to assess the in vitro activity and selectivity for COX-2 inhibition, using a prostaglandin E2 radioimmunoassay. The cells utilized are primary human fibroblasts induced with interleukin-1 to produce COX-2, and the human kidney epithelial cell line 293 stably transfected to produce COX-1 constitutively. Cells are plated out into well plates in which the assay is performed. Fibroblasts are stimulated to synthesize COX-2 by treatment<br><br>
vomited with IL-1; the 293 cells require no induction. Both cell lines are pre-treated with compound dilutions for 15 minutes at 37X, then 40 ^M arachidonic acid is added as<br>
exogenous substrate for the production of PGE2, which is measured in supematant by radioimmunoassay. For isO determinations, compounds are tested at 5 concentrations in quadruplicate (highest concentration 30 |mX); the mean inhibition of PGE2 (compared to cells not treated with compound) for each concentration is calculated, a plot made of mean % inhibition vs. log compound concentration for all experiments, and the overall IC50 value calculated using a 4-parameter logistic fit.<br>
Typically IC50 values for compounds of formula I in the COX-2 inhibition assay are as low as about 0.005 ppm whereas ICso values in the COX-1 inhibition assay are greater than 30  <br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compounds of examples 6, 9 and 18 have an IC50 of about 0.13, 0.25, 0.007 ^iM, respectively, for COX-2 inhibition with no significant COX-1 inhibition at 30 HM.<br>
The inhibition of prostaglandin-E2 production produced by COX-2 can be determined in vivo in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged subcutaneous air pouch model in the rat (see "Advances in Inflammation Research", Raven Press, 1986 and J. Med. Chem. 39,1846 (1996)).<br>
Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and then dorsal air pouches are prepared by subcutaneous injection of 10 ml of air through a sterile 0.45 micron syringe-adapted filter. Twenty-four hours after preparation, the air pouches are injected with LPS (8 jig/pouch)<br>
suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline. Compounds for evaluation are suspended in fortified cornstarch and administered by gavages one hour prior to LPS challenge. The pouch contents are harvested three hours after LPS challenge and PGE2 levels present in the pouch fluids are measured by enzyme immunoassay. ED50 values for inhibition of PGE2 formation are calculated by least squares linear regression. Illustrative of the invention the compounds of examples 6, 9,18 and 24 have an ED50 in the range of about 0.2 mg/kg p.o. to about 0.6 mg/kg p.o..<br>
The in vivo inhibition of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) produced by COX-1 can be measured ex vivo in the seem of rats after oral administration of compound.<br><br>
Briefly, rats are fasted ovemight, administered compound in fortified cornstarch vehicle by garage, and sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation 30 minutes to eight hours later. Blood is collected by cardiac puncture into tubes without anti-coagulant, allowed to clot and serum is separated by centrifugation. Serum is stored frozen for later analysis of thromboxane B2 by radioimmunoassay. Each experiment contains the following groups (5-6 rats per group): vehicle control and test compounds, either at different doses or different time points. Thromboxane B2 data is expressed as a percentage of the levels measured in the vehicle control group. Illustrative of the invention the compounds 1(d), 1(g), 3(a), and 6(a) cause less than a 50% inhibition of sang thromboxane B2 production at an oral dose which is 50-150 times the ED50 value for in vivo COX-2 inhibition.<br>
Antiinflammatory activity is determined using the carrageenan induced rat paw edema assay.<br>
Sprague Dawley rats (200-225g) are fasted ovemight, then orally dosed with the compound suspended in a fortified comstarch solution. After one hour, a 0.1 ml volume of 1% carrageenan in saline is injected into the subplantar region of the left hind paw which causes an inflammatory response. At 3 hours post carrageenan, the rats are euthanatized and both hind paws are cut off at the paw hair line and weighed on an electronic balance. The amount of edema in the inflamed paw is determined by subtracting the weight of the non-inflamed paw (right) from the weight of the inflamed paw (left). The percent inhibition by the compound is determined for each animal as the percent paw weight gained as compared to the control average. ED30 values are determined for each dose-response using the curve fitting formula,<br>
100/ 1+(Drug Concentration/Edo <br>
â¢Mean ED30 values are calculated as the average of ED30 values determined from independent dose response assays.<br>
The gastric tolerability assay is used to assess gross ulceration in the rat, measured four hours after oral administration of the test compound. The test is carried out as follows:<br>
Rats are fasted ovemight, administered compound in fortified cornstarch vehicle by gavages, and sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation four hours later. The stomachs are removed and gross gastric lesions counted and measured to give the total lesion length per rat. Each<br><br>
experiment contains the following groups (5-6 rats per group): vehicle control, test compounds, and diclofenac as a reference compound.<br>
Data are calculated as the mean number of ulcers in a group, the mean length of ulcers (mm) in the group and as the ulcer index (Ul).<br>
Ul = mean length of ulcers in a group x ulcer incidence<br>
where ulcer incidence is the fraction of animals in the group with lesions (100% incidence is 1).<br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compounds of examples 6, 9,18 and 24 are essentially free of any gastric allergenic effect at 100 mg/kg p.o.<br>
Intestinal tolerability can be determined by measuring the effect on intestinal penneability. Lack of increase in permeability is indicative of intestinal tolerability.<br>
The method used is a modification of a procedure by Davies, et al. Pharm. Res. 1994; 11:1652-1656 and is based on the fact that excretion of orally administered Â®^Cr-EDTA, a marker of small intestinal permeability, is increased by NSAIDs. Groups of rats (&gt; 12/group) and administered a single, oral dose of test compound or vehicle by gastric intubations. Immediately following compound dose, each rat is administered  EDTA (5  <br>
gastric intubations. The rats are placed in individual metabolic cages and given food and water ad labium. Urine is collected over a 24 hour period. Twenty-four hours after administration of ^^Cr-EDTA the rats are sacrificed. To quantify compound effect on Intestinal permeability, the excreted ^^Cr-EDTA measured in the urine of compound treated rats is compared to the excreted ^^Cr-EDTA measured in the urine of vehicle treated rats. Relative permeability is determined by calculating the activity present in each urine sample as a percent of the administered dose after correcting for background radiation.<br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compounds of examples 6, 9,18 and 24 demonstrate no effect or only a minimal effect on intestinal pemieability at a dose of 30 mg/kg p.o.<br>
The analgesic activity of the compounds of the invention is detemnined using the well-known Randall-Semite assay.<br><br>
The Randall-Selitto paw pressure assay measures antinociception (analgesic activity) in inflamed tissue by comparing the pressure threshold in the inflamed paw of the rat after oral administration of test drug with that in the inflamed paw of rats administered com starch vehicle orally.<br>
Groups of 10 male Wistar rats weighing 40-50 gems are fasted overnight prior to testing. Hyperalgesia is induced by the injection of 0.1 ml of a 20% suspension of Brewer's yeast with a 26 gauge needle into the subplantar region of the right hindpaw. The left paw is not injected and is used as the control paw for determination of hyperalgesia. Vehicle (Fortified com starch suspension 3%) at lOml/kg, reference compound (diclofenac is run in every experiment at the same dose as test compounds) and test compounds at different doses suspended in vehicle at lOml/kg are administered orally 2 hours after the yeast injection. The threshold for paw withdrawal is quantified with a Basil Analgesic-meter 1 hour after oral administration of test compounds. The nociceptive threshold is defined as the force in grams at which the rat withdraws its foot or vocalizes. Either vocalization or foot withdrawal is recorded as a response.<br>
The data are analyzed by comparing the mean pain threshold of the corn starch vehicle-treated group for the inflamed and non-inflamed paws to that of individual drug-treated rats. Individual rats in the drug-treated groups and positive control (diclofenac) group are called reactors if the individual pain threshold in each paw exceeds the control group mean threshold by two standard deviations of that mean. The mean pain thresholds of the inflamed paw in the control group are compared to the individual pain thresholds of the inflamed paw in the test drug group. The non-inflamed control mean pressure threshold is compared to the non-inflamed individual pressure thresholds in the test groups. Results are expressed as number of reactors in each test group (n = 10) for inflamed and non-inflamed paws. Percentages are calculated by dividing number of reactors by total number of rats used for a compound.<br>
Illustrative of the invention the compounds of examples 6, 9,18 and 24 all increase the pain threshold in the inflamed paw at 10 mg/kg administered orally. These compounds selectively elevate the pain threshold in the inflamed paw with no threshold elevation in the non-inflamed paw indicating a peripheral mechanism.<br><br>
The antiarthrJtic effect of the compounds of the invention can be detemnined in the well-known<br>
chronic adjuvant arthritis test in the rat. Ophthalmic effects may be demonstrated using<br>
â¢t methods well known in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be prepared e.g.<br>
(a) by coupling a compound of formula II or lAA<br><br>
wherein R has meaning as defined above; Ra is lower alkyl, preferably isopropyl; and Re and R7 represent lower alkyl; or Re and R7 together with the nitrogen atom represent piperidine, pyrrolidine or morpholino;<br>
with a compound of funnels III<br><br>
wherein Ri, R2, R3, R4 and R5 have meaning as defined above in the presence of copper and cuprous iodide to obtain a compound of formula IV or Ivan<br><br><br>
and hydrolyzing the resulting compound of formula IV or IVa to a compound of funnels I; or<br>
(b) for compounds In which R represents ethyl, by condensing a compound of formula V<br><br>
wherein R1-R7 have meaning as defined herein, with a reactive functional derivative of acetic acid, such as acetyl chloride, in a Frieda-Crafts acylation to reaction to obtain a compound of the formula VI<br><br><br>
wherein Ri-Repave meaning as defined herein which is In turn hydrogenolyzed and then hydrolyzed to obtain a compound of formula I wherein R represents ethyl; or<br>
(c) by hydrolyzing a lactam of fondue VII<br><br>
wherein R and R1-R5 have meaning as defined herein, with a strong base; and<br>
in the above processes, if desired, temporarily protecting any interfering reactive groups and then isolating the resulting compound of the invention; and, if desired, converting any resulting compound into another compound of the invention; and/or if desired converting a free carboxylic acid of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivative thereof; and/or if desired, converting a resulting free acid into a salt or a resulting salt into the free acid or into another salt.<br><br>
In starting compounds and intermediates, which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present such as amino, hydroxy and carboxyl groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected hydroxy, amino and carboxyl groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino, hydroxy and carboxyl groups without other undesirable side reactions taking place. For example, hydroxy protecting groups are preferably benzyl or substituted benzyl groups.<br>
the preparation of compounds of formula IV according to process (a) is carried out under conditions of a modified Pullman condensation for the preparation of diarylamines, e.g. in the presence of copper powder and copper (I) iodide and potassium carbonate, in an inert high boiling solvent such as nitrobenzene, toluene, xylene or N-methylpyrrolidone, at elevated temperature, e.g. in the range of 100Â°-200 , preferably at reflux temperature, according to general methodology described by F. Nowhere, Chem. Aster. 94&gt; 15402x (1951) and Moser et al., J. Med. Chem. 33, 2358 (1990).<br>
Intennediates of Formula IV wherein Ri or R5 is methyl or ethyl can be prepared from intermediates of formula IV, wherein Ri or R5 is bromo by reaction with tetramethyltin or tetraethyl tin under conditions of a Heck reaction, that is in the presence of a palladium salt (such as Pd(0Ac)2 or PdCl2). a triarylphosphine (such as tri (o-tolyl)phosphine) and a base (such as triethylamine, sodium acetate) in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>
Hydrolysis of the resulting ortho-anilinophenylacetamides of formula IV is carried out in aqueous alkali hydroxide, e.g. in 6N NaOH in the presence of an alcohol (e.g. ethanol, propanol, butanol) at elevated temperature, such as reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
The hydrolysis of esters of formula IVa is carried out according to methods known in the art, e.g. under basic conditions as described above for the compounds of formula IV or alternatively under acidic conditions, e.g. using methanesulfonic acid.<br>
The starting materials of formula II or Ha are generally known or can be prepared using methodology known in the art, e.g. as described by F. Nowhere in Japanese patent application Mo. 78/96,434 (1978).<br><br>
For example, 5-methyl or 5-ethylanthranilic acid is converted to the ortho-diazonium derivatives followed by treatment with an alkali metal iodide in acid (e.g. sulfonic acid) to obtain 5-alkyl-2-iodobenzoic acid. Reduction to the corresponding benzyl alcohol (e.g. with diborane), conversion of the alcohol first to the bromide and then to the nitrile, hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acetic acid and conversion to the N,N dialkylamide according to methodology known in the art yields a starting material of formula II.<br>
Alternatively, the starting materials of formula II wherein R is ethyl can be prepared by Friedel-Crafts acetylation of oxindole with e.g. acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride, reduction of the resulting ketone by e.g. catalytic hydrogenolysis, followed by hydrolytic cleavage of the resulting 5-ethyloxindole to 5-ethyl-2-aminophenylacetic acid. Diazotization in the presence of e.g. potassium iodide yields 5-ethyl-2-iodo-phenylacetic acid which is converted to an amide of formula II.

The diarylamines of formula VIII can be prepared by an Ullmann condensation as described hereinabove and other methods known in the art, e.g. a Buchwald coupling reaction.<br>
For example, the diarylamines of formula VIII wherein Ri, Ra, R4 and R5 are fluoro and R3 is hydrogen can be prepared by reacting the corresponding aniline (4-ethyl- or 4-methyl-aniline)<br><br>
with pentafluorobenzene in the presence of a strong base such as lithium amide or n* butyllithium, as generally described in J. of Fluorine Chemistry 5, 323 (1975).<br>

Sodium 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenyl acetate (0.5 g, 1.43 mmol) and benzyl 2-bromoacetate (272  1,1.72 mmol) are stirred at 50' in dimethylformamide (50 ml) for 14 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture is cooled to room temperature and partitioned between EtOAc (200 ml) and water (200 ml). The organic layer is washed again with water (2 X 200 ml), brine (100 ml), dried (MgS04) and concentrated on a rotovap. The crude benzyl ester is flash chromatographed on silica (10-15% EtOAc/hexane) to provide the benzyloxycarbonylmethyl ester of 5-ethyl-2-(2',3 5\6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetic acid as a colorless oil. The oil is dissolved in HOAc (20 ml) and dehydrogenated (55 psi) with a 10% Pd/C (0.1 g) catalyst for 1 hour. The catalyst is removed by filtration through Celite and the filtrate poured into water (200 ml) and EtOAc (200 ml). The organic layer is washed with water (250 ml) and brine (100 ml). Evaporation on a rotovap and trituration with Et20/hexanes gives the ester, carboxymethyl 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenyl acetate, m.p. 151-153Â°, of the formula (la), wherein R is ethyl, Ri = R2 = R4 = R5 = Fluoride and R3 = H.<br><br><br><br>
Example 34<br>

The mixture is concentrated on a rotovap and the residue is then treated and evaporated to dryness first with THF (2 X100 ml) and then with benzene (2 x 100 ml). The remaining off-white sodium salt of 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6'-tetrafluoroanirmo)phenylacetic acid is dried under high vacuum overnight.<br>
The sodium 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetate (2.0 g, 6.2 mmol) is dissolved in DMF (70 ml) and treated with 1-bromo-4-chlorobutane (1.2 g, 6.9 mmol) at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is concentrated under high vacuum (35-50 mbar) on a rotovap. The resulting oil Is partitioned between water (200 ml) and EtaO (200 ml). The organic layer is washed with brine (100 ml), dried (MgS04) and concentrated on a rotovap to give the chlorobutyl ester as a light-brown oil. The chlorobutyl ester is dissolved in CH3CN (100 ml) and treated with silver nitrate (8,7 g, 50 mmol) at reflux temperature for 18 hours. The reaction is cooled to room temperature and the solvent removed on a rotovap. The residue is partitioned between CH2CI2 (200 ml) and water (200 ml). The organic layer is dried (MgS04). concentrated and flash-chromatographed (5% EtOAc/hexane) to give nitroxybutyloxy 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6Metrafluoroanilino)phenylacetate as a clear oil.<br>
Example 35<br>
Sodium 5-ethyl-2-(2',3'.5',6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetate (7.3 g. 20.9 mmol) is dissolved in DMF (100 ml) and treated with benzyl 2-methyl-2-bromopropionate (6.2 g, 24.2 mmol) at 50Â°<br>
for 96 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and concentrated under high vacuum (35-50 mbar) on a rotovap. The resulting oil is partitioned between water (200 ml) and EtaO (200 ml). The organic layer is washed with brine (100 ml), dried (MgS04) and concentrated on a rotovap to give a light-brown oil. Flash chromatography (0-10% EtOAc/hexane) on silica-gel gives the ester as a light-red oil. The ester (1.5 g, 3.0 mmol) is dissolved in EtOAc (150 ml) and hydrogenated (55 psi) with a 10% Pd/C (0.3 g) catalyst for 1 hour. The catalyst is removed by filtration through Celite (500 ml). Evaporation on a rotovap followed by trituration with hexanes gives 1-cariDoxy-1-methylethyl 5-ethyl-2-(2',3',5',6'-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetate as a crystalline white solid, m.p. 104-108Â°.<br><br>
Example 36<br>
Isopropyl 5-methyl-2-(2'-fluoro-6'-trifluoromethylanilino)phenylacetate (2.9 g, 8.4 mmol) is dissolved in methanesulfonic acid (25 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 8 hours. The reaction mixture is slowly added to 200 ml of ice in a beaker. After the ice has melted, the solution is stirred to produce a white solid which is isolated by filtration. The solid is flash chromatographed on silica-gel using 35% EtOAc as an eluant to give 5-methyl-2-(2'-fluoro-6'-trifluoromethylanilino)phenylacetic acid as a white solid, m.p. 155-156Â°.<br>
The starting material is prepared as follows:<br>
2-lodo-5-methylphenylacetic acid (20.0 g, 72 mmol) and a catalytic amount of 98% sulfuric acid (0.2 ml) are dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (200 ml) and heated to reflux temperature for 48 hours. The solvent is removed on a rotovap and the residual oil partitioned between EtOAc (500 ml) and saturated NaHCOa solution (500 ml). The organic layer is separated, dried (MgS04) and concentrated on a rotovap. The residual oil is distilled using a kugelrohr apparatus to give a clear, colorless oil which solidifies on standing at room temperature to give isopropyl 2-iodo-5-methylphenylacetate, m.p. 48-50Â°.<br>
Isopropyl 2-iodo-5-methylphenylacetate (10.0 g, 31 mmol), 2-amino-3-fluorobenzotrifluoride (20.0 g, 111 mmol), copper powder (1.1 g, 16 mmol), copper (I) iodide (3.1 g, 16 mmol) and K2C03(4,3 g, 31 mmol) are stirred together in xylenes (200 ml). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux temperature for 48 hours. While still slightly warm (40Â°) the brown suspension is filtered through a<br>
pad of Celite, which in turn is rinsed with toluene (100 ml). The filtrate is evaporated on a rotovap and then flash chromatographed on silica-gel using 3-4% EtOAc in hexanes as the eluant. The product, isopropyl 5-methyl-2-(2'-fluoro-6'-trifluoromethylanilino)phenyl acetate, is isolated as a pale yellow oil.<br>
Example 37<br>
Similarly 5-methyl-2-(2',4'-dichloro-6'-trifluoromethylanilino)phenylacetic acid, m.p. 157-158Â° is prepared by a process as described in Example 36.<br><br>
Example 38<br>
N-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)-5-ethyloxindole (72.67 g; 0.235 mol, is slurried in water containing a little methanol (10% v/v; 253 ml), and sodium hydroxide solution (50 wt%; 16.1 ml) is added. The mixture is stirred at 80-85Â° for 2-4 hours, then cooled to ambient temperature. The<br>
reaction solution is partially concentrated under reduced pressure (25-30 mm). After removal of 50 mi of the solvent, the mixture is diluted with water (150 ml) and t-butyl methyl ether (250 ml). The cooled mixture is acidified to pH 6.5-7.0 with aqueous HCI (12.1 A/J 19.5 ml), keeping Xho temperature at 0-5"". The aqueous layer is discarded and the organic layer is washed with water (250 ml). The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure (20-100 mm) while exchanging the solvent to toluene. After the more volatile components have been removed, the batch volume is adjusted to 400-450 ml. This mixture is warmed to 70**, clarified, concentrated to one-half volume, and cooled to 0Â°. After stirring at this temperature for 2 hours, the product is collected and is washed with toluene/heptanes (10:90; 100 ml). The resulting solid is dried under reduced pressure at 50-60Â° for 4-8 hours to give 5-ethyl-2-(2', 3', 5', 6*-tetrafluoroanilino)phenylacetic acid of Example 18.<br>
The starting material is prepared as follows:<br>

A solution of n-Bali (2.5 M in hexanes, 800 ml; 2.00 mol) is added under N2 with cooling maintaining the reaction temperature below 15Â°. After stirring for 1 hour at 10Â°, neat pentafluorobenzene (168.06 g; 1.00 mol) is added with cooling to the mixture, keeping the temperature at 10-20Â°. The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature for 1.5 hours, then aqueous HCI (6 A^ 500 ml) is added slowly with vigorous stirring and cooling, keeping the reaction temperature below 35Â°.<br>
The quenched reaction is stirred at ambient temperature for 0.5-18 hours. The lower aqueous layer is separated, and the top organic phase is concentrated under reduced pressure (30-150 mm) to one-fourth volume. The concentrate is diluted with heptane (300 ml) and extracted with water (300 ml). The separated top organic layer is stirred over 230-400 mesh silica gel (50 g) and filtered. The filter cake is washed with heptanes (4 X 50 ml). The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure (20-30 mm) to give solid crude product. This material is recrystallized from hot heptane (200 ml) and collected at 0Â°. This<br><br>
solid is washed with cold heptane (100 ml) and dried under reduced pressure at 40' to give pure-(2\3'.5'.6Metrafluorophenyl)-4-ethylaniline.<br>
The diphenylamine derivative (230.0 g; 0.854 mol; 1.0 eq) is treated with chloroacetyl chloride (192.96 g; 1.709 mol; 2.0 eq) at 100-115Â° for 2 hours (vigorous HCI evolution is controlled by rate of heating). The mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, then concentrated under reduced pressure (10-12 mm) to 80-90% of the original volume, 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (80 ml) 4s added and the diluted mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (10-12 mm) until no more chloroacetyl chloride is found by GC analysis (30-40 ml distilled) to give crude N-(2',3',5',6*-pentafluorophenyl)-N-chloroacetyl-4-ethylaniHne in solution.<br>
Anhydrous AICI3 (170.84 g; 1.281 mol; 1.5 eq) was slumped with 1,2-dichlorobenzene (480 ml) under Ng and cooled to 0**. The crude product solution from the previous step (theoretically containing 295.34 g; 0.854 mol; 1.0 eq) is added slowly with vigorous stoning, keeping the temperature below 60 A solution of Ethic (1.8 M in toluene; 733 ml; 1.319 mol; 1.7 eq) is added, and the vigorously stirred reaction mixture is heated to â160 distilling toluene (135-160"*) at ambient pressure. Upon cessation of the distillation (-690 ml)Â» the reaction temperature is held at 155-165Â° for 3.5-5 hours. The mixture is cooled to ambient<br>
temperature, then poured onto crushed ice (2.5 kg) with vigorous stirring under Ng. The reaction vessel is rinsed with 1.2-dichloroben2ene (50 ml). The cold quenched product slurry is filtered and the filter cake is washed sequentially with 10% 1,2-dichlorobenzene/heptane (100 ml) and heptane (100 ml). The material is dried under reduced pressure at 80-90^ for 12-16 hours to give N-(2',3',5\6'-tetrafluorophenyl)-5-ethyloxindole.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
