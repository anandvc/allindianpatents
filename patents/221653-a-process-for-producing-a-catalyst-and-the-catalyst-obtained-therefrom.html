The present invention relates to a process for producing a catalyst comprising at least one platinum metal on a nonporous nonmetallic support and the catalyst and to a process for preparing hydrogen peroxide and a process for catalytic reduction using these catalysts.<br>
Catalysts comprising platinum metals as catalytically active substances are used in many forms and have great industrial importance, e.g. in the reduction or hydrogenation of organic compounds and in the catalytic purification of waste gases from industry and motor vehicles.<br>
For industrial applications, use is made where possible of supported platinum metal catalysts which have only small amounts of the expensive noble metals on usually catalytically inactive support materials having a large surface area, e.g. carbon, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, ceramic or other mineral supports. The application of the catalytically active metals to such porous supports is usually carried out by impregnation of the supports with solutions of salts or organometallic compounds of the catalytically active metal and subsequent immobilization by precipitation, hydrolysis, heat treatment, calcination and/or activation.<br>
EP-A-0 875 235 describes a process for producing supported noble metal catalysts on porous oxidic supports by electroless deposition of noble metals from aqueous solutions using reducing agents and in the presence of complexing agents.<br>
DE-A-44 12 463 describes the use of a colloidal palladium solution comprising at least one reducing agent and at least one protective colloid and also at least one noble metal or noble metal compound for the pretreatment of electrically nonconductive substrate surfaces before they are metallized by means of a metallizing solution. The deposition of at least one platinum metal on a nonporous nonmetallic support is not described. Furthermore, this document provides no teachings regarding the production of catalysts.<br><br>
US 5,082,647 describes a process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide which uses a catalyst comprising at least one metal of transition group VIII on a hydrophobic support. Hydrophobic support materials used are, inter alia, styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene and propylene, hydrophobicized silicon dioxide, polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorinated carbon and carbon which has been hydrophobicized by treatment with a silane or with fluorene. The hydrophobic support has a surface area of at least 50 m2/g.<br>
WO-A-99/32398 describes a process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, in which catalysts on supports having low BET surface areas of preferably less than 1 m2 per ml of reactor volume are said to be used. Support materials proposed are nonporous nonmetals such as glass, quartz and organic polymers. As regards the production of the catalysts, reference is simply made to the disclosure of EP-A-0 878 235, US 5,338,531 and J.R. Kosak "A new novel fixed bed catalyst for the direct combination of H2 and 02 to H202", Chem. Ind. (Dekker), 1995, Volume 62, Catalysis of Organic Reactions. However, none of the references cited describes the production of catalysts on nonmetallic pore-free supports. According to the working example of WO-A-99/32398, a catalyst is produced by impregnating unpretreated glass wool with palladium chloride and hexachloroplatinic acid and subsequently reducing the metals by means of hydrogen at 300°C. In the subsequent preparation of hydrogen peroxide using this catalyst in the gas phase, only extremely low space-time yields of about 5 g/1 x h are achieved.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing improved nonmetal-supported platinum metal catalysts. Essentially complete deposition of the expensive platinum metal and/or good adhesion of the noble metal to the nonmetallic support should preferably be ensured in this process. Furthermore, the catalysts should have a high catalytic activity and selectivity in hydrogenations, particularly in the direct synthesis of H202 from hydrogen and oxygen. The catalysts should preferably have improved operating lives.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for producing catalysts comprising at least one platinum metal on a nonporous nonmetallic support, which comprises firstly activating the support and then electrolessly depositing at least one platinum metal on the support which has been pretreated in this way. For the electroless deposition, an aqueous medium comprising at least one compound or one complex of a platinum metal and at least one reducing agent is brought into contact with the<br><br>
support. In contrast to the catalysts known from the prior art, the catalysts produced according to the present invention have excellent catalyst properties. In addition, essentially quantitative deposition of the platinum metal from the solution can be achieved. Surprisingly, good adhesion of the platinum metals to the nonporous nonmetallic supports used is also achieved. Thus, the catalytic coatings produced according to the present invention have a high abrasion resistance even under severe mechanical stress, as occurs, for example, in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. In general, no mechanical detachment is observed even after prolonged operation.<br>
The present invention provides a process £Q£ prQduc.iag_-Q-x^talyst comprising at least one platinum metal on a nonporous nonmetallic support, which comprises<br>
a)	if desired, roughening the surface of the support,<br>
b)	activating the support, which may have been roughened on the surface, by treating it, preferably with a reducing agent and a salt of a platinum metal,<br>
c)	electrolessly depositing at least one platinum metal on the support which has been treated as described in step b), by bringing an aqueous medium comprising at least one compound or one complex of a platinum metal and at least one reducing agent into contact with the support, and<br>
d)	if desired, activating the catalyst obtained in step c).<br>
According to the present invention, a nonporous support is used for producing the catalyst. For the purposes of the present invention, a nonporous support is a support having a mercury (Hg) porosymmetry pore volume of not more than 1.0 ml/g, preferably not more than 0.1 ml/g and more preerably not more than 0.05 ml/g. The ratio of pore volume to total volume of the support workpiece is preferably not more than 2%, more preferably not more than 0.5%.<br>

The support is preferably used in the form of a particulate, linear, sheet-like or three-dimensional structure. The term "particulate structures" encompasses the range from fine pigments through to macroscopic particles. It includes, in particular, particulate materials having a particle size of from 0.25 nm to 10 mm. Linear structures are, in particular, fibers, filaments and the like. The nonmetallic supports are preferably used in the form of glass or polymer fibers. Sheet-like structures are, in particular, woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, felts, nonwovens, meshes, mats, etc. Three-dimensional structures are shaped bodies in general of various dimensions.<br>
The nonmetallic supports are preferably used in the form of shaped bodies. The shaped bodies can have the shape of spheres, pellets, short extrudates, Raschig rings, Pall® rings, saddles, cylindrical mesh packing elements, hackettes, spirals or helices.<br>
The nonmetallic supports are also preferably used in the form of woven fabrics. The fabric can in turn be used in the form of monoliths, i.e. ordered packings.<br><br>
Particularly suitable monoliths are made up of a plurality of layers of corrugated, creased and/or smooth woven fabrics which are preferably arranged so that adjacent layers form more or less closed channels. The hydraulic diameter of the channels is preferably in the range from 1 to 10 mm, in particular from 1.5 to 3 mm (in accordance with the definition in VDI-Warmeatlas, Section LE 1). The channels can be straight or curved. Preference is given to using multilayer woven fabrics forming smooth and corrugated or creased channels. While shaped bodies are generally placed in the reactor as a loose bed, monoliths are preferably installed in the reactor, particularly in such a way that the channels are inclined to the flow direction of the reaction medium. The woven fabric layers themselves are preferably installed parallel to the flow direction in the reactor. If a plurality of these units are installed in series, they are preferably installed so that the flow channels are inclined alternately in different directions relative to the flow direction. The units are preferably installed so that the woven fabric layers of two successive units form an angle of preferably about 90° to one another. Rolled modules of corrugated or creased and, if desired, also flat layers of woven fabric are likewise suitable.<br>
Step a)<br>
In general, the nonporous nonmetallic supports used according to the present invention can be used for producing the catalyst in the form in which they are obtained in their respective production process. However, if desired, the surface of the support can also be roughened piror to the subsequent process steps.<br>
To roughen the support surface, it is possible to use mechanical and/or chemical methods. Roughening of supports made of mineral materials, e.g. vitreous or ceramic supports, is preferably carried out by known mechanical methods, e.g. by grinding using a material whicTTTTas a hardness greater than that of the support. Suitable abrasives are, for example, quartz, corundum, garnet, emery and diamond. A suitable method of roughening glass or ceramic spheres is treatment with a finely pulverulent abrasive in a rotating drum. The abrasive can subsequently be separated from the support material by customary methods such as screening or rinsing with water. Vitreous surfaces can also be roughened by sand blasting.<br><br>
A further suitable method of increasing the roughness of the support material is treatment with suitable chemicals. Mineral materials can advantageously be roughened on the surface by etching, e.g. with hydrofluoric acid, aqueous alkali or an aqueous mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid. Supports made of plastic can advantageously be roughened by treatment with chemicals which attack the surface, preferably oxidizing agents. Suitable chemicals for roughening surfaces of plastics are, for example, nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, etc. Preference is given to using about 10% strength nitric acid, about 50% strength hydrogen peroxide or a mixture of about 10% strength ammonia and about 10% strength hydrogen peroxide, if appropriate for a number of hours and at elevated temperatures.<br>
Step b)<br>
By "activation" of the support is meant an operation in which nuclei for electroless deposition are formed on the surface. The nuclei for electroless deposition are generally metal, preferably a platinum metal and more preferably palladium. The support is preferably activated by treating it with a reducing agent and a salt of a platinum metal.<br>
Treatment of the support with the reducing agent and with the platinum metal salt can be carried out simultaneously or in succession. In both cases, the treatment can be carried out in one or more steps. If desired, the support can be subjected to cleaning before the treatment. Likewise, a cleaning step can follow the treatment or, in the case of treatment in a plurality of steps, each treatment step.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment, the treatment of the support in step b) is carried out using an aqueous medium comprising at least one reducing agent and at least one salt of a platinum metal. The treatment can be carried out in one or more steps.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the treatment of the support in step b) is carried out separately using at least one reducing agent and at least one platinum metal salt. A preferred method of treating the support in step b) comprises the following substeps:<br>
bl) if appropriate, cleaning the support,<br>
b2) treating the support with an aqueous medium comprising at least one reducing agent,<br><br>
b3) treating the support with an aqueous medium comprising at least one salt of a platinum metal,<br>
where the steps b2) and b3) can be carried out one or more times. The treatment can be commenced and concluded either with step b2) or with step b3). The steps b2) and b3) are preferably carried out from one to ten times.<br>
If desired, the treatment steps b2) and/or b3) can be followed by a cleaning step, e.g. by bringing the support into contact with a rinsing solution.<br>
The cleaning of the support prior to the treatment steps can be carried out by customary methods known to those skilled in the art. These include, for example, treatment with aqueous surfactant solutions, and/or treatment with organic solvents and solvent mixtures, e.g. ethanol, ethanol/water mixtures, ethyl acetate, acetone, etc. If desired, cleaning can be carried out under the action of ultrasound. Suitable rinsing solutions for cleaning the support after a treatment step are, for example, the pure aqueous media used for the treatment steps and, in particular, water.<br>
Suitable aqueous media for the treatment steps are mentioned below for step c), which is incorporated by reference at this point. Step b) is preferably carried out using an aqueous medium which is essentially free of organic solvents. This medium preferably further comprises at least one inorganic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid. The aqueous media used in step b) preferably have an acidic pH. Particular preference is given to a pH of 
For treatment of the support with the reducing agent (and if desired simultaneously with the platinum metal salt), use is made of an aqueous medium comprising at least one reducing agent in fully or partly dissolved form. Suitable reducing agents are mentioned below for step c), which is incorporated by reference at this point. Reducing agents which are preferred for use in step b) are tin(II) chloride and titanium(IH) chloride.<br>
Platinum metal salts which are suitable for treatment of the support in step b) are mentioned under step c) below, which is incorporated by reference at this point. Preference is given to using at least one palladium salt as platinum metal salt. The aqueous medium used for treatment of the support in step b) can further comprise, in addition to at least one platinum metal salt, at least one further salt of a metal of the iron group<br><br>
and/or transition group 1. Preference is given to nickel salts and silver salts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treatment of the support in step b) is carried out by bringing it into contact with an aqueous medium having a tin(II) chloride content in the range from about 1 to 20 g/1 and a content of concentrated hydrochloric acid of from about 1 to 50 ml/1. The treatment is preferably carried out at from about 10 to 40 °C, in particular at ambient temperature. The duration of the treatment with the reducing agent is preferably in a range from about 0.1 to 30 minutes, in particular from 0.5 to 10 minutes. The support is preferably rinsed with water after treatment with the reducing agent. It is subsequently brought into contact with an aqeous medium having a palladium chloride content in the range from about 0.02 to 2 g/1 and a content of concentrated hydrochloric acid in the range from about 0.1 to 10 ml/1. This aqueous medium can further comprise other metal salts, as described above. The treatment with the platinum metal is likewise preferably carried out at from about 10 to 40°C, in particular at ambient temperature. The treatment time is preferably in a range from about 0.1 to 30 minutes, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 10 minutes. The treated support is then preferably rinsed again with water.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, an aqueous medium comprising at least one platinum metal salt and, if desired, at least one further salt of a metal of the iron group or of transition group 1 is firstly provided for the treatment of the support in step b) and the support is subsequently brought into contact therewith. The support is preferably treated with the solution provided for a period of about 24 hours. The treated support is then preferably rinsed with water.<br>
The amount of platinum metal deposited on the support in step b) is small compared to the total amount deposited on the support. The amount of platinum metal deposited in step b) is preferably not more than 10% by weight, particularly preferably not more than 1% by weight, of the total amount deposited on the support.<br>
The pretreatment of the support in step b) of the process of the present invention assists in producing catalysts in which the platinum metal adheres well to the nonporous support material. The catalytic coatings produced in this way display a high abrasion resistance even in the case of severe mechanical stress.<br><br>
If desired, the support which has been pretreated in this way can subsequently be dried by customary methods known to those skilled in the art. However, it can also be used moist for the subsequent treatment in step c).<br>
Step c)<br>

Preference is given to ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum, particularly preferably palladium and platinum. The catalysts of the present invention can comprise a plurality of platinum metals. All combinations of the abovementioned platinum metals are suitable; preference is given to combinations of palladium and platinum, of palladium and rhodium, of palladium and iridium, of palladium, platinum and rhodium and of palladium, platinum and iridium. A particularly preferred combination is palladium and platinum. In the combinations which include palladium, palladium is preferably the main platinum metal component. The proportion of palladium is then preferably above 40% by weight, preferably above 60% by weight and particularly preferably above 80% by weight, based on the total platinum metal content. The further platinum metals which may be present as secondary constituents can each make up upto 30% by weight, preferably upto 20% by weight and particularly preferably upto 15% by weight, of the total platinum metal content. The platinum metals preferably comprise from 80 to 100% by weight of palladium and from 0 to 20% by weight of platinum or iridium. In most cases, from 1 to 3 of the abovementioned platinum metals make up more than 95% by weight of the total amount of platinum metals used, if further platinum metals are present in addition to a main platinum metal, these are generally present in amounts of greater than 0.001% by weight, preferably greater than 0.01% by weight, e.g. in amounts of about 0.1% by weight, about 1% by weight or about 5% by weight.<br>
The catalytically active component of the catalysts of the present invention may further comprise, apart from platinum metals, other elements as additive components or possibly in the form of impurities. Preferred additive components which, for example, can influence the activity and/or selectivity of the catalysts are selected from among metals, nonmetals and their compounds. These preferably include metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, gold, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, aluminum, tin, lead, arsenic, antimony and<br><br>

The addition of the additive components to the reaction solution can also be carried out toward the end or after the end of the deposition of platinum metal, as a result of which the additive components are incorporated preferentially at the surface of the active components. The additive components can also be applied to the catalysts of the present invention in a separate second step, e.g. by deposition from the vapor phase or by electroless deposition from aqueous or nonaqueous media. The application of additive components to the catalysts of the present invention in a separate second step is particularly advantageous when application of the additive components specifically to the surface of the active component is desired.

i added in concentrations of from 1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 5 to 700 ppm and particularly preferably from 50 to 600 ppm. However, it is also possible to use other stabilizers such as<br><br>
formaldehyde.<br>
The reaction gas, which may comprise not only hydrogen and oxygen but also inert gases such as nitrogen or noble gases, generally has an 02:H2 ratio in the range from 2:1 to 1000:1. Preference is given to using a molar ratio in the range from 5:1 to 100:1, in particular from 20:1 to 100:1.

The partial pressures of the reaction gases in the reaction gas mixture both in the reactor and in the circulating gas are preferably selected so that the hydrogen concentration is below the lower explosion limit under the reaction conditions.<br>
The process described makes it possible to prepare hydrogen peroxide solutions having hydrogen peroxide contents above 2% by weight, preferably in the range from 3 to 25% by weight. The concentration can be preselected by setting the streams in the desired manner. The selectivity of hydrogen peroxide formation is, for example, above 65%, preferably &gt; 70%. Long-term tests have shown that no decrease, or only a slight decrease, in the catalyst activity and selectivity can be observed even after an operating time of more than 40 days.<br>

The spheres are poured onto a suction filter with perforated plate and the abrasive is washed out with water- The roughened glass spheres are subsequently placed on a G3 frit. The glass spheres thus treated had a pore volume below the determination limit of Hg porosymmetry and a BET surface area of 0.024 m2/g. A solution of 10 g of tin(II) chloride and 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 2 1 of water is made up and is allowed to seep through the glass spheres over a period of 2 minutes. The spheres on the frit are then washed with 2 1 of water. A solution of 0.4 g of palladium chloride and 2 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 2 1 of water is subsequently allowed to seep through the layer of glass spheres, again over a period of 2 minutes, and the spheres are again washed with water. The entire procedure is repeated another five times. The activated spheres are then dried overnight at 75°C and 100 mbar.<br>

A solution of 13-6 g of sodium hypophosphite in 14-6 g of water is subsequently added and the contents are heated further to 46°C. After 5 minutes, the solution is drained off and the spheres are washed with water. Subsequent analysis shows that 88% of the palladium and 39% of the platinum have been deposited. The procedure is repeated in the same way using the other one third portions of the activated support, and the three parts are subsequently combined to give Catalyst 3. Analysis indicated a palladium content of 180 mg/kg.<br>

A solution of 200 mg of sodium borohydride in 10 ml of water is added in two portions. After 20 minutes, the contents of the tube are heated to 40°C and the reaction solution is circulated for a further 15 minutes at this temperature. After draining off the liquid, the catalyst is washed with water and dried at 75°C and 100 mbar.<br>

reactor, a solution of 18.6 g of sodium hypophosphite, 41.9 g of ammonium chloride and 62 ml of 25% strength ammonia in 620 ml of water is added and the contents of the reactor are heated to 42°C. A solution of 346 mg of sodium tetrachloropalladate and 1.43 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid in 10 ml of water is subsequently added while maintaining pumped circulation. After 10 minutes, the solution is drained off and the extrudates are washed with water. The second half of the activated support is treated with the same chemicals as described above in a stirred flask, with the mixture being stirred at 1000 rpm at 45°C. The catalyst is filtered off and washed with water. The two parts are mixed and dried at 50°C and 100 mbar. Analysis shows that the noble metals have been deposited quantitatively. Analysis indicates a palladium content of 285 mg/kg.<br>
Catalyst 12:<br>
840 ml of 3 mm pellets of a polyamide 6 (Ultramid® B3 from BASF AG) (having a pore volume below the detection limit of Hg porosymmetry and a BET surface area of 0.027 m2/g) are activated with tin and palladium as described for Catalyst 1. 240 ml of the pellets are placed in the coating tube, a solution of 9.6 g of sodium hypophosphite, 21.6 g of ammonium chloride and 32 ml of 25% strength ammonia in 160 ml of water is added and the contents of the tube are heated to 45°C. Subsequently, while maintaining pumped circulation, a solution of 137 mg of sodium tetrachloropalladate and 0.52 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid in 10 ml of water is added followed by 67.7 mg of disodium tungstate in 5 ml of water- After 25 minutes, the solution is drained off and the pellets are washed with water. The coating procedure is repeated using the remaining activated support (in 2 portions). Finally, all three portions are mixed to give Catalyst 12.<br>
Catalyst 13:<br>
750 ml of 3 mm glass Raschig rings (having an Hg porosymmetry pore volume of 0.036 ml/g and a BET surface area of 0.034 m2/g) are activated with tin and palladium as described for Catalyst 1. One third of the activated Raschig rings are placed in a double-walled glass tube having a length of 1 m and a diameter of 2 cm. The glass tube is connected to a peristaltic pump for circulating liquid and a thermostatted bath for heating via the double wall. A solution of 15.6 g of sodium hypophosphite, 35.1 g of ammonium chloride and 52 ml of 25% strength ammonia in 430 ml of water is introduced into the tube, the circulating pump is switched on and the tube is heated to an internal temperature of 46°C by means of the thermostatted bath. A solution of 250 mg of<br><br>
sodium tetrachloropalladate and 1.1 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid in 10 ml of water is subsequently added. Vigorous evolution of gas occurs and the glass rings immediately become black. After 5 minutes, the liquid is drained off, the rings are washed with water and dried overnight at 75°C and 100 mbar. The coating procedure is repeated using a further third of the activated support each time. Finally, all three portions are mixed to give Catalyst 13. Analysis indicates a palladium content of 155 mg/kg.<br>
Catalyst 14:<br>
5 mm of soda-lime glass spheres are roughened and activated as described for Catalyst 1. 115 ml of the activated glass spheres are placed in the coating tube. A solution of 6.8 g of sodium hypophosphite, 15.3 g of ammonium chloride and 23 ml of 25% strength ammonia in 228 ml of water is added and the contents of the tube are maintained at 25°C while maintaining pumped circulation. A solution of 38.8 mg of sodium tetrachloropalladate in 3.8 ml of water is subsequently added and pumped circulation is continued. After 12 minutes, the liquid is drained off and the supported catalyst is washed with water. The catalyst is subsequently dried overnight at 75°C and 100 mbar. The coating procedure is repeated using another 115 ml of the activated glass spheres, and the two portions are mixed to give Catalyst 14. The palladium content of the catalyst is 71 mg/kg.<br>
Catalyst 15:<br>
100 ml of steatite spheres having a diameter of 1.5-2.5 mm are treated twice with palladium chloride and tin chloride as described for Catalyst 1. The activated spheres are placed in the coating reactor. After addition of a solution of 40 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid (as 1% strength solution in water), 21.6 g of ammonium chloride and 32 ml of 25% strength ammonia in 220 ml of water, the contents of the reactor are maintained at 24°C while maintaining pumped circulation. A solution of 200 mg of sodium borohydride in 7 ml of water is subsequently added in two portions and the mixture is circulated further. After 40 minutes, the liquid is drained off, the catalyst is washed with water until free of salts and dried at 75°C under reduced pressure. Analysis shows that 60% of the platinum have been deposited on the support.<br>
II. Use properties<br>
The propeties of the catalysts were tested in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen (Examples<br><br>
El to E19) and in the hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone and hydrodehydrolinalool (Examples E20 and E21).<br>
Examples E1-E9 and E11-E19, Comparative Example CE10:<br>
Example 1<br>
A double-walled reactor having an internal diameter of 2.1 cm and ■a.length of 2 m is charged with Catalyst 1. At 40°C and a pressure i of 50 bar, a solution of 5 g/1 of phosphoric acid and 120 mg/l of hydrogen bromide in water is allowed to trickle through the catalyst bed at a rate of 250 ml per hour. At the same time, a mixture of 3% of hydrogen and 97% of oxygen is circulated by means of a gas compressor through the catalyst bed from the top downward at a rate of 10400 Standard 1/h. The gas mixture is generated by means of two mass flow meters for hydrogen and oxygen. Its composition is determined and adjusted with the aid of a thermal conductivity detector over which a small substream is passed as off-gas stream.<br>
The amount of hydrogen consumed by the reaction to hydrogen peroxide and water is calculated from the mass inflows of the gases and from the off-gas stream.<br>
The product mixture leaving the reaction tube is separated from the gases in a separator while still under pressure and is discharged from the plant in liquid form. The mass flow is balanced against the feed stream. The hydrogen peroxide content in the liquid product is determined by titration.<br>
The selectivity based on hydrogen is calculated from the mass of the output stream, the hydrogen peroxide content and the amount of hydrogen consumed. The space-time yield is given by the amount of hydrogen peroxide formed per unit time divided by the volume of 690 ml of catalyst bed in the tube reactor.<br>
Examples 1 to 9 and 11 to 19 and Comparative Example 10 were carried out using a method analogous to Example 1. The reaction conditions and results of the reaction are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>
As Comparative Example 10 using the catalyst 8 which is not according to the present invention demonstrates, catalysts on a porous support as described in the prior art have a significantly lower activity than the catalysts of the present invention.<br>
Example 20: Hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone<br>
A double-walled reactor having an internal diameter of 2.1 cm and a length of 2 m is charged with Catalyst 4. At 40°C and a hydrogen pressure of 10 bar, a solution of 13% by weight of 2-ethylanthraquinone in a mixture of 70% by weight of a hydrocarbon mixture (Shellsol®) and 30% by weight of tetrabutylurea is allowed to trickle continuously through the catalyst bed at a rate of 2700 ml/h.<br>
The hydrogenated solution leaving the reaction tube is separated from the gas in a separator and discharged from the plant in<br><br>
liquid form.<br>
Analysis of the output solution by gas chromatography indicated a conversion of 73% and a selectivity of 99.9% in respect of 2-ethylanthrahydroquinone.<br>
Example 21: Hydrogenation of hydrodehydrolinalool<br>
Catalyst 14 (152 ml) together with hydrodehydrolinalool is placed in a double-walled tube having a diameter of 2 cm. By means of appropriate pumps, the liquid and hydrogen are circulated at 1.1 bar and 80°C at cross-sectional throughputs of 200 m3/m2 in each case. The acetylenic alcohol is hydrogenated to hydrolinalool at a conversion rate of 15%/h and a selectiv<br><br><br>
ity of &gt; 98%.<br><br><br><br>
