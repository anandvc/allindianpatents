				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the communication of data and, more specifically, to a technique<br>
for controlling streaming data packet transmissions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Increasing amounts of data are being transmitted from servers to clients via<br>
communication infrastructures such as packet-based Internet Protocol (IP) networks. One<br>
particular application that is increasing in popularity is multimedia streaming. However,<br>
improvements must be made in providing reliable data streams before widespread<br>
adoption of such services. For example, as data transmission link rates between the IP<br>
network and a client device of a user tend to fluctuate, any disturbances in data delivery to<br>
the user may result in severe degradation of the playout to the end user, i.e. a degradation<br>
in the quality of the media observed by the user. In particular, it is important that there be a<br>
sufficient supply of packets of data at the client device to be fetched by a multimedia<br>
application as playout (i.e., the display of the multimedia file by the multimedia<br>
application or player) progresses.<br>
In many cases, the packet transmission rate cannot be changed, as this rate depends upon<br>
the bandwidth of communication link (or it is at least impractical to change the packet<br>
transmission rate). However, the rate at which data is fed to the output device of the user<br>
often must be changed. Typically, for streaming applications, such adjustments are<br>
achieved using "stream switching". With stream switching, the same media content, e.g. a<br>
particular video sequence, is pre-encoded at different bit rates and stored at the server.<br>
Hence, different versions of the same stream are available. During transmission, the server<br>
selects the particular version that has a data bit rate most appropriate based upon the<br>
current available bandwidth in the network and based upon the status of the client buffer.<br>
Switching logic employed by the server decides if and when to switch to another version<br>
of the stream. In the case of a so-called "down-switch", the stream is switched to a version<br>
with a lower encoded bit rate. In the case of an "up-switch", the switch is made to a<br>
version with a higher encoded bit rate. In many implementations, the criteria for switching<br>
employs predefined thresholds defined with respect to client buffer status. In one example,<br>
thresholds are based upon a buffer fill level, which represents the amount of data within<br>
the client buffer in bytes. In another example, the thresholds are based upon a playout<br>
2<br><br>
length (PT) of stored media in the client buffer, which represents the amount of time in<br>
seconds it will take for the data already within the client buffer to be played out to the user.<br>
Herein, examples involving playout length are described, though buffer fill level or other<br>
appropriate parameters can instead be used.<br>
Some conventional techniques for determining the status of the client buffer utilize<br>
information within Real Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) receiver reports (RRs).<br>
Information pertaining to the next sequence number (NSN) or oldest buffered sequence<br>
number (OBSN) within the client buffer and the highest received sequence number<br>
(HRSN) within the client buffer is contained with the RR and is used to determine the<br>
consumed buffer space as the size of each packet within the range from the HRSN to the<br>
NSN/OBSN is known. If the free space within the client buffer is below a preferred client<br>
buffer fill level, then a different version of the stream is selected. For example, if buffer<br>
playout length (PT) falls below a predetermined minimum threshold (PTDOWN), then a risk<br>
of buffer draining occurs, i.e. the client buffer becomes empty such that there is no data to<br>
stream to the user. This results in a playout freeze, wherein the last image displayed to the<br>
user is typically frozen until a sufficient amount of additional data can be added to the<br>
client buffer to restart the stream to the output device employed by the user, i.e. a<br>
"rebuffering" of the client buffer is required. Rebuffering can be extremely annoying from<br>
the standpoint of the user.<br>
To avoid possible rebuffering due to client buffer draining, the server detects when the<br>
playout length (PT) within the client buffer drops below threshold PTDOWN, then adjusts<br>
the bit rate (i.e. selects a version of the stream having a different bit rate) in an attempt to<br>
prevent the client buffer from becoming completely drained. More specifically, the server<br>
performs a down-switch, i.e. a switch to a lower bit rate stream. The reason that a down-<br>
switch is performed, rather than up-switch, is that the most likely reason that the client<br>
buffer is being drained is that the link rate between the server and the client buffer is less<br>
than anticipated, i.e. the effective bandwidth is less than needed for the bit rate currently<br>
being used. As a result, data is not being received by the client buffer at the same rate at<br>
which the client buffer is feeding data to the output device of the user. Hence, the client<br>
buffer, which should remain fairly well populated with data, becomes drained. By<br>
switching to the lower bit rate, the client buffer feeds data to the display unit at a lower<br>
rate, thereby allowing more time for data to be received from the server, and thereby<br>
preventing the client buffer from becoming completely drained. From the standpoint of the<br>
user, the quality of the media stream is downgraded because of the down-switch, e.g. the<br>
size of the displayed image of the video stream becomes smaller, the resolution of the<br>
3<br><br>
image becomes less, or higher distortions are observed in the image. Yet, this is preferable<br>
to the aforementioned playout freeze that occurs during rebuffering.<br>
On the other hand, if buffer playout (PT) length exceeds a predetermined maximum<br>
threshold (PTup), then a risk of buffer overflow occurs, i.e. the client buffer becomes full<br>
such there is no room for additional packets. Any packets received by the client buffer but<br>
not stored therein are typically not re-sent by the server and hence the data of those packets<br>
are simply not forwarded to the output device of user. Once the client buffer is again<br>
capable of storing packets, the data stream resumes with the new packets. Thus, from the<br>
standpoint of the user, there is a sudden loss of content as the stream simply jumps ahead.<br>
In the case of a film or movie, dialogue can be lost, thus interfering with the ability of the<br>
user to follow story. In the case of music, the song simply jumps ahead. As will be<br>
appreciated, this can be quite annoying from standpoint of the user as well.<br>
To avoid a disruption of the stream due to client buffer overflow, the server detects when<br>
the playout length (PT) within the client buffer exceeds threshold PTUP and then performs<br>
an up-switch, i.e. a switch to a higher bit rate stream. The reason that an up-switch is<br>
performed, rather than down-switch, is that the most likely reason that the client buffer is<br>
becoming to full is that the link rate between the server and the client buffer is greater than<br>
anticipated, i.e. the effective bandwidth is greater than needed for the bit rate currently<br>
being used. As a result, data being received by the client buffer at a rate higher than the<br>
rate at which the client buffer feeds the data to the output device of the user. Hence, the<br>
client buffer overflows. By switching to the higher bit rate, the client buffer feeds data to<br>
the output device at the higher rate, thereby preventing the client buffer from overflowing.<br>
From the standpoint of the user, the quality of the media stream is improved due to the up-<br>
switch, e.g. the size of the displayed image of the video stream becomes larger or the<br>
resolution of the image becomes greater. Hence, the up-switch helps prevent interruption<br>
of the stream and improves media quality, which both benefit the user.<br>
Simple logic for performing up-switches and down-switches may be represented as<br>
follows:<br>
IfPT&gt; PTUP then<br>
Perform up-switch<br>
else if PT<ptdown></ptdown>
Perform down-switch<br>
end if.<br>
4<br><br>
Appropriate selection of these thresholds is critical to the overall media impression of the<br>
user. In the case of down-switch that is performed too late, a rebuffering event will<br>
happen. In the case of an up-switch that is performed too late, the user receives a lower<br>
quality media then is otherwise necessary and, as noted, a break in the data stream may<br>
occur as the result of a buffer overflow. Likewise, if a down-switch is performed earlier<br>
than necessary, the user receives a lower quality media than is otherwise necessary. If an<br>
up-switch is performed earlier than necessary, a down-switch may then soon be required,<br>
resulting in annoying fluctuations in the quality of the media. To avoid these problems,<br>
multiple down-switch thresholds and multiple up-switch thresholds can potentially be<br>
used. As playout length decreases towards buffer drainage, a series of the down-switch<br>
thresholds are crossed, each triggering a down-switch. Conversely, as playout length<br>
increases towards buffer overflow, a series of up-switch thresholds are crossed, each<br>
triggering an up-switch.<br>
However, after a switch has occurred and a stream with the new bit rate has been<br>
transmitted, it takes some time before the switch has any effect on the playout length of the<br>
client buffer. First, there is a transmission delay until a first packet containing data<br>
encoded at the new rate reaches the client buffer. During this time period, the playout<br>
length of the stored media in the client buffer is unaffected by the new rate. Hence, if the<br>
playout length was increasing toward a possible buffer overflow, it will likely continue to<br>
increase. Conversely, if the playout length was a decreasing toward possible buffer<br>
drainage, it will likely continue to decrease. Also, even after the arrival of the first packet<br>
at the new bit rate, the playout length may change only slowly at first. For example, there<br>
may still be some packets sent with data at the previous bit rate that had not yet been<br>
received by the client buffer. Therefore, the switching conditions are often still valid and<br>
several switches then follow a first switch, which are often unnecessary. In the case of a<br>
first down-switch, several further down-switches may be performed, resulting in a stream<br>
bit rate that is much lower than necessary. Often, the down-switches do not stop until the<br>
lowest stream bit rate has been selected. This behavior results in an unnecessarily low<br>
media stream quality for the user. In the case of an up-switch, several further up-switches<br>
can happen, resulting in a stream bit rate that is too high, often to the highest rate possible.<br>
This results in a stream bit rate that is much too high compared with the current available<br>
network bandwidth, triggering a series of down-switches.<br>
As a result, frequent and annoying variations in stream quality are observed by the user.<br>
Moreover, if a bit rate that is much too high has been selected, subsequent down-switches<br>
often cannot be executed fast enough, resulting in annoying rebuffering events and playout<br>
freeze. Likewise, if a bit rate that is much too low has been selected, subsequent up-<br>
5<br><br>
switches often cannot be executed fast enough, resulting in annoying buffer overflows and<br>
associated loss of data. Even with only a single up-switch threshold and a single down-<br>
switch threshold, these sorts of problems can arise, particularly if the thresholds are set too<br>
close together.<br>
Even more problems can arise when transmitting media content that has a variable bit rate.<br>
Conventionally, each pre-encoded version of the multimedia stream has a single bit rate,<br>
and hence the bit rate of a stream only changes if the server switches to a different stream<br>
having a faster or slower rate, as already described. However, in some cases, it is<br>
appropriate to provide streams with a varying bit rate, particularly to accommodate storage<br>
and transmission of large media files. In other words, each version of a stream may have<br>
portions at one bit rate and other portions at another. Preferably, the bit rate for individual<br>
sections of a particular version of a stream is chosen based on the content of the individual<br>
section. For example, one portion of a stream may be fairly static, permitting a low bit rate<br>
to adequately capture the content. Thereafter, a higher bit rate may be needed to adequately<br>
capture more dynamic content. By setting the bit rate of each portion of a multimedia<br>
stream based on the dynamic content of that portion of the stream, overall file size can be<br>
reduced while still adequately conveying the content.<br>
When applying conventional stream switching techniques to variable bit rate streams,<br>
various problems can arise. In particular, the changing bit rates of the stream can<br>
compound the aforementioned problems, resulting in even more frequent and unnecessary<br>
switches, causing further annoyance to the user and, often, wasting bandwidth.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an improved technique for controlling stream switching of<br>
variable bit rate data so as to provide more stable and reliable content to user, and it is to<br>
this end that the invention is principally directed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention may be embodied in a method for controlling packet transmissions of<br>
variable bit rate data from a server to a client having a client buffer wherein the server<br>
switches among different versions of a stream of variable bit rate data being transmitted<br>
based on a status of the client buffer. In accordance with the method, an initial version of a<br>
stream of variable bit rate data is selected for transmission and a value (PT) representative<br>
of an amount of data within the client buffer is tracked. A bit rate (BR) of a portion of<br>
variable bit rate data yet to be transmitted within the selected version of the stream is<br>
determined. Then, switches to different versions of the stream, having different mean bit<br>
6<br><br>
rates, are controlled by the server based on the value (PT) representative of the amount of<br>
data within the client buffer in combination with the bit rate (BR) of the portion of variable<br>
bit rate data yet to be transmitted.<br>
In one example, the bit rate (BRNEXT) of the next sequential portion of data to be<br>
transmitted is determined. If a BRNEXT exceeds an average bit rate (BRAVE), then the step<br>
of controlling switching is performed to delay any switch to a version of the stream having<br>
a generally higher bit rate, i.e. up-switches are delayed.<br>
In another example, if BRNEXT exceeds the average bit rate (BRAVE), the step of controlling<br>
switching is performed to expedite any switch to a version of the stream having a generally<br>
lower bit rate, i.e. down-switches are expedited.<br>
In yet another example, if BRNEXT is below the average bit rate (BRAVE), the step of<br>
controlling switching is performed to expedite any switch to a version of the stream having<br>
a generally higher bit rate, i.e. up-switches are expedited.<br>
In a preferred implementation, the server controls switches to different versions of the<br>
stream based on a current status of the client buffer by applying one or more thresholds to<br>
data already in the client buffer. The step of controlling switching is performed by<br>
dynamically adjusting the one or more thresholds based on the bit rates (BR) of the portion<br>
of variable bit rate data to be transmitted and then determining whether to switch to a<br>
different version of the stream by applying the one or more adjustable thresholds to the<br>
value (PT) representative of the amount of data within the client buffer.<br>
In an example of the preferred implementation, the one or more thresholds include an up-<br>
switch threshold (PTUP) and a down-switch threshold (PTDOWN). The step of dynamically<br>
adjusting the one or more thresholds is performed by determining an average bit rate<br>
(BRAVE) of the variable bit rate data and then selectively adjusting the up-switch and<br>
down-switch thresholds (PTUP and PTDOWN) based on a comparison of the bit rate<br>
(BRNEXT) of a next portion of variable bit rate data to be transmitted with the average bit<br>
rate (BRAVE) of the variable bit rate data. The step of selectively adjusting the up-s witch<br>
and down-switch thresholds includes the step of increasing the up-switch and down-switch<br>
thresholds (PTUP and PTDOWN) if the bit rate (BRNEXT) of the next portion of variable bit<br>
rate data exceeds the average bit rate (BRAVE). The step of selectively adjusting the up-<br>
switch and down-switch thresholds also includes the step of decreasing the up-switch<br>
threshold (PTUP) if the bit rate (BRNEXT) of the next portion of the variable bit rate data is<br>
below the average bit rate (BRAVE) and if the up-switch threshold (PTUP) exceeds the<br>
7<br><br>
down-switch threshold (PTDOWN)- In other words, PTUP is not adjusted downwardly if it<br>
would then fall below PTDOWN.<br>
In the preferred implementation, the step of increasing the up-switch and down-switch<br>
thresholds (PTUP and PTDOWN) if the bit rate (BR) of the next portion of variable bit rate<br>
data exceeds the average bit rate (BRAVE) is performed by determining the bit rate<br>
(BRNEXT) of the next portion of variable bit rate data then calculating a ratio (F) of the bit<br>
rate (BRNEXT) of the next portion of variable bit rate data to the average bit rate (BRAVE).<br>
The up-switch and down-switch thresholds (PTUP and PTDOWN) are then multiplied by the<br>
ratio (F) to thereby increase the thresholds. The step of decreasing the up-switch threshold<br>
(PTUP) is also performed by determining the bit rate (BRNEXT) of the next portion of<br>
variable bit rate data and then calculating a ratio (F) of the bit rate (BRNEXT) of the next<br>
portion of variable bit rate data to the average bit rate (BRAVE). The up-switch threshold<br>
(PTUP) is then multiplied by the ratio (F) to thereby decrease the threshold. Then, the larger<br>
of the decreased up-switch threshold (PTUP*F) and the down-switch threshold (PTDOWN) is<br>
selected for use as a new up-switch threshold.<br>
In various implementations, the values representative amounts of data within the client<br>
buffer are representative of playout lengths (PT) of the data or buffer fill levels. The<br>
average bit rate (BRAVE) may be representative of an average bit rate over the entire<br>
version of the stream being transmitted or may instead be representative of an average bit<br>
rate of data that has already been transmitted within the version of the stream being<br>
transmitted.<br>
Depending on the implementation, the client may be a mobile communications terminal<br>
such as a mobile telephone, and in addition, or in the alternative, the server may be<br>
integrated into a mobile communications terminal so that the link between the server and<br>
the network may be wireless. In addition, the method according to the present invention<br>
may be performed by one or more intermediary network nodes (such as proxies) arranged<br>
between the server and the client. The method may also be utilized in architectures having<br>
plurality of data streams being buffered by the client buffer (or multiple client buffers<br>
depending on the configuration of the client).<br>
The invention may also be embodied in a computer program product, which may be stored<br>
on a computer readable recording medium, comprising program code portions for<br>
performing any of the steps of the above methods when the computer program product is<br>
run on a computer system.<br>
8<br><br>
The invention may further comprise an apparatus comprising a computer processor and a<br>
memory coupled to the processor, where the memory is encoded with one or more<br>
programs that may perform any of the steps of the above methods.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus for controlling packet<br>
transmissions of variable bit rate data from a server to a client having a client buffer<br>
wherein the server switches among different versions of a stream of variable bit rate data<br>
being transmitted based on a status of the client buffer. The apparatus comprises: an<br>
anticipatory variable bit rate stream transmission controller for selecting an initial version<br>
of a stream of variable bit rate data for transmission; a client buffer monitor for tracking a<br>
value representative of an amount of data within the client buffer; a variable bit rate<br>
determination unit a bit rate (BR) of a portion of variable bit rate data yet to be transmitted<br>
within the selected version of the stream; and wherein the anticipatory variable bit rate<br>
stream transmission controller then controls switches to different versions of the stream,<br>
having different mean bit rates, based on the value (PT) representative of the amount of<br>
data within the client buffer in combination with the bit rate (BR) of the portion of variable<br>
bit rate data yet to be transmitted<br>
The apparatus may be configured as a fixed or mobile network component, such as a<br>
network server and/or a wireless terminal. In addition, the apparatus may be constituted by<br>
an intermediary network node, such as a proxy.<br>

Fig. 1 illustrates a sample architecture 100 that may be used in connection with the<br>
invention including a server 105 that may be coupled to a client 115 via a communications<br>

UDP or other data transport protocol for managing the real-time transmission of<br>
multimedia data (with a transport layer protocol such as UDP - User Datagram Protocol).<br>
The packets are transmitted to a public network 130 (e.g., the Internet, however, an<br>

The operator network 135 includes a core network 140 that provides communication links<br>
between the server 105 and the client 115. The core network 140, which may optionally<br>
have a buffer, provides the packets received from the RTP/UDP module 125 for buffering<br>
in a buffer within a radio access network (RAN) 145 (such as a buffer in the SGSN or in<br>
the RNC) prior to their transmission by a wireless transmitter 150. The buffers of the core<br>
network 140 (if buffering is utilized) and the RAN 145 are arranged in series and<br>
constitute a network buffer.<br>
The client 115 receives the packets transmitted by the wireless transmitter 150 in a client<br>
buffer 155. The packets are transferred from the client buffer 155 to a RTP/UDP module<br>
160 for delivery to and use by the media application module 165 (or multimedia player).<br>
For purposes of this application, the phrase "packet transmission rate" will refer to the rate<br>
of transmission of packets from the server 105 to the IP network 110, the phrase "link<br>
rate" will refer to the rate of transmission of packets from the IP network 110 to the client<br>
115, and the phrase "content rate" shall refer to the rate that data is transferred from the<br>
client buffer 115 to the media application module 165 for playout by the media application<br>
module 165.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, a method embodiment 200 of the invention is illustrated which<br>
may be performed, for example, by the system of Fig. 1. The method is preferably<br>
implemented by the server, such as a server 105 of Fig. 1, but may be implemented by any<br>
other appropriate network component. In the following descriptions, it will be assumed<br>
that a server implements the steps of the method. Beginning at step 202, the server selects<br>
an initial version of a stream of variable bit rate data for transmission. The initial version<br>
of the stream is selected, in accordance with otherwise conventional techniques, from<br>
among a group of different versions of the stream having generally different pre-encoded<br>
transmission rates. For example, a first stream may begin with a bit rate of 1 megabit<br>
(Mbit)/second, whereas a second stream may begin with a bit rate of 2 Mbits/second. Since<br>
the stream itself has a variable bit rate, each version of the stream likewise has a variable<br>
bit rate. Hence, whichever version of the stream is selected, the bit rate of data encoded<br>
within the stream will change. For example, the first version of the stream may switch to a<br>
bit rate of 2 Mbits/second after ten seconds, whereas the second version of the stream may<br>
switch to a bit rate of 3 megabits Mbits/second after ten seconds, i.e. both versions of the<br>
stream have pre-encoded bit rates that increase by 1 Mbit/sec after ten seconds.<br>
Three exemplary versions of a single bit stream are shown in Fig. 3. Each version of the<br>
stream has a bit rate that varies with time. The versions are all synchronized with one<br>
11<br><br>
another, i.e. the bit rates all increase at the same time or all decrease by the same time.<br>
However, the mean bit rates of the various versions of the stream differ from one another.<br>
The server performs up-switches and down-switches by switching between the different<br>
versions of the stream. In the example if Fig. 3, only three versions of the stream are<br>
shown. Typically, more versions are pre-stored. Also, in the example, the lowest bit rate of<br>
the highest bit rate version 205 of the stream is at a higher rate than the highest bit rate of<br>
the next version 207 of the stream. Likewise, the lowest bit rate of version 205 of the<br>
stream is at a higher rate than the highest bit rate of version 209. This, however, need not<br>
be the case. Often there is at least some overlap in bit rates. Also, in the example, the rate<br>
changes are shown as being smooth, i.e. the rate increases smoothly to a peak then<br>
decreases smoothly. This need not be the case either. In many examples, the bit rates<br>
change discontinuously, i.e. the rate jumps from one level (such as 1 Mbit/sec) to a<br>
different level (such as 2 Mbit/sec).<br>
Returning to Fig. 2, the selected version of the stream is transmitted at step 202 from the<br>
server to the client by taking pre-encoded data from the version of the stream and placing<br>
that pre-encoded data into data packets, which are transmitted at a predetermined packet<br>
transmission rate to the client. Note that any change in the bit rate of the variable bit rate<br>
data within a stream being transmitted does not typically require a change in the packet<br>
transmission rate, which is determined base upon bandwidth considerations. Likewise, the<br>
choice of one version of the stream over another version typically does not entail any<br>
changes in packet transmission rate.<br>
At step 204, the server tracks a value representative of the amount of data currently within<br>
the client buffer. This too may be performed in accordance with otherwise conventional<br>
techniques. In one example, if the client buffer is implemented in accordance with RTCP<br>
protocols, the server receives feedback from the client buffer, which includes the<br>
NSN/OBSN and HRSN data fields from which the amount of data in the client buffer is<br>
determined. As noted, the amount of data in the client buffer may be represented, for<br>
example, in terms of a playout length (PT), a client buffer fill level, or other appropriate<br>
value. In the following descriptions, examples will be described using playout length (PT).<br>
At step 206, the server determines the bit rate (BR) of a portion of the variable bit rate data<br>
yet to be transmitted. Preferably, it is the next sequential portion of data to be transmitted<br>
that the server examines, i.e. the server determines a value (BRNEXT) representative of the<br>
bit rate of the next portion of data to be transmitted. The next portion of data may be<br>
defined, for example, in terms of a predetermined number of seconds worth of data to be<br>
transmitted or may be defined as that portion of data from the data currently being<br>
12<br><br>
transmitted until a next preset change in the data. For example, if the pre-encoded stream<br>
of variable bit rate data is to maintain its current bit rate for the next 12 seconds before<br>
switching to another bit rate, then the next portion of data comprises the next 12 seconds<br>
worth of data.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary version 208 of a stream of variable bit rate data being<br>
transmitted. The stream includes portions of differing bit rates, denoted BR#1, BR#2, BR#3,<br>
BR#4 etc. BR#1 and BR#3 may both be, for example, 1 Mbit/second, whereas BR#2 and<br>
BR#4 may both be, for example, 2 Mbits/second. As can be seen, portions may be of<br>
different lengths, i.e. durations. In the example, arrow 210 denotes the point within the<br>
stream corresponding to data currently being transmitted. The next portion of data,<br>
therefore, is data commencing at point 210. The rate of that data is BR#2. If the next<br>
portion of data is defined in terms of that portion of data from the data currently being<br>
transmitted until a next preset change in the data, then BRNEXT is simply BR#2. If, instead,<br>
the next portion of data is defined in terms of a predetermined number of seconds' worth<br>
of data to be transmitted, then the next portion of data may encompass two or more<br>
different bit rates. In that case, the server may be configured to simply select the first of<br>
those bit rates for use as BRNEXT or may instead be configured to calculate the average bit<br>
rate BRAVE over that predetermined period of time for use as BRNEXT. In any case, a value<br>
representative of the bit rate of some portion of data yet to be transmitted is determined at<br>
step 206 of Fig. 2.<br>
At step 212 of Fig. 2, the server then controls switches to different versions of the steam,<br>
having the different mean bit rates, based on the value (PT) representative of the amount of<br>
data currently within the client buffer and based on the bit rate (BR) of the portion of<br>
variable bit rate data yet to be transmitted, e.g. the server controls up-switches and down-<br>
switches based upon both PT and BRNEXT. By taking into account the bit rate of data yet to<br>
be transmitted, in addition to PT, the server is capable of avoiding many of the<br>
unnecessary rate switches that occur in conventional systems employing only fixed rate<br>
switched thresholds.<br>
Preferably, if BRNEXT exceeds BRAVE, any up-switch due to a change in the status of client<br>
buffer is delayed. In other words, if any increase in playout length within the client buffer<br>
would otherwise have triggered a switch to a different version of the stream having a<br>
generally higher transmission rate, that switch is delayed. If an up-switch were instead<br>
performed by the server prior to a point in the stream where the variable bit rate was due to<br>
increase anyway, the up-switch would likely be counterproductive and might necessitate a<br>
compensatory down-switch. In this regard, by performing an up-switch prior to a point in<br>
13<br><br>
the stream where the bit rate of the variable bit rate stream increases, two bit rate increases<br>
thereby occur, one after the other. As a result, the bit rate is then probably higher than<br>
necessary, likely triggering a compensatory down-switch to prevent possible buffer<br>
drainage. By instead delaying an up-switch in circumstances where the bit rate of variable<br>
bit rate data is due to increase anyway, the server likely avoids both an unnecessary up-<br>
switch and a subsequent compensatory down-switch, thereby providing a more consistent<br>
level of media quality to the end-user.<br>
Also preferably, if BRNEXT exceeds BRAVE, down-switch due to a change in the status of<br>
client buffer is expedited. In other words, if a decrease in playout length within the client<br>
buffer would otherwise have triggered a switch to a different version of the stream having<br>
a generally lower transmission rate, that switch is expedited if the variable bit rate is due to<br>
increase. By expediting the down-switch in circumstances where the bit rate of the data<br>
being transmitted is due to increase, the server thereby helps prevent a possible rebuffering<br>
event. If, on the other hand, the server did not anticipate the increase in bit rate within the<br>
variable bit rate data, a down-switch triggered by the playout length falling below the<br>
conventional fixed down-switch threshold (PTDOWN) might be too late to prevent<br>
rebuffering given that the increasing bit rate of the stream itself will accelerate buffer<br>
drainage.<br>
Preferably, if BRNEXT is instead below BRAVE, any up-switch due to a change in the status<br>
of client buffer is expedited. In other words, if an increase in playout length within the<br>
client buffer would otherwise have triggered a switch to a different version of the stream<br>
having a generally higher transmission rate, that switch is expedited if the variable bit rate<br>
is due to decrease. By expediting the up-switch in circumstances where the bit rate of the<br>
data being transmitted is due to decrease, the server thereby helps prevent a possible<br>
overflow event. If, on the other hand, the server did not anticipate the decrease in bit rate<br>
within the variable bit rate data, an up-switch triggered by the playout length exceeding the<br>
conventional fixed up-switch threshold (PTUP) might be too late to prevent buffer overflow<br>
given that the decreasing bit rate of the stream itself will accelerate buffer overflow.<br>
Moreover, the expedited up-switch provides improved media quality to the user more<br>
promptly.<br>
Note however, that when BRNEXT is below BRAVE, any down-switch due to a change in the<br>
status of client buffer is preferably not delayed (nor expedited). Rather, in that case, down-<br>
switches are preferably triggered based on the conventional fixed down-switch threshold<br>
(PTDOWN). Although a down-switch could potentially be delayed in view of the fact that<br>
the bit rate of the variable bit rate data is due to decrease soon anyway, such is not<br>
14<br><br>
performed in the preferred implementation of invention so as to avoid risk of buffer<br>
drainage.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5, a preferred implementation of variable bit rate logic for use at step<br>
two 212 of Fig. 2 will now be described. Beginning at step 300, the server determines<br>
values for PTUP and PTDOWN. PTUP and PTDOWN may be predetermined, fixed up-switch<br>
and down-switch thresholds and may be set in accordance with otherwise conventional<br>
techniques. At step 302, the server determines values for BRNEXT and BRAVE. BRNEXT may<br>
be determined by examining the encoded bit rates associated with data to be transmitted,<br>
which is stored within the server or otherwise accessible by the server. In one example,<br>
BRAVE is calculated by examining a record of the encoded bit rates of data already<br>
transmitted (along the durations of time during which packets containing the data encoded<br>
at the various bit rates were transmitted.) Otherwise routine arithmetic may be used to<br>
calculate the actual average. In a second example, a BRAVE value for the entire stream may<br>
be calculated and stored beforehand (as the individual streams are encoded before the<br>
streaming session starts, individual BRAVE values may be determined for the individual<br>
streams before play out.) In other words, in that second example, BRAVE is not the average<br>
bit rate of only that portion of data that has already been transmitted but instead represents<br>
the average over the entire stream, i.e. BRAVE is the mean bit rate illustrated, e.g., in Fig. 3.<br>
At step 304, the server calculates a value F, which is representative of a ratio of BRNEXT to<br>
BRAVE, i-e. F = BRNEXT/BRAVE- Hence, if BRNEXT exceeds BRAVE, F is then greater than<br>
1.0. If BRNEXT exceeds BRAVE, F is then less than 1.0. In cases where BRNEXT is equal to<br>
BRAVE, F is then equal to 1.0. If no data has yet been transmitted (such that there is no<br>
current value of BRAVE), then F is simply set to 1.0. If no data remains to be transmitted<br>
within a current stream of data, such that there is no current value for BRNEXT, then F is<br>
also preferably re-set to 1.0 for use in connection with a next stream of data to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
At step 306, the server sets an adjustable up-switch threshold (PTUP-ADJ) equal to PTUP<br>
multiplied by F, i.e. PTUP*F, and also sets an adjustable down-switch threshold (PTDOWN.<br>
ADJ) equal to PTDOWN multiplied by F, i.e. PTDOWN*F. Hence, if BRNEXT exceeds BRAVE,<br>
then PTUP-ADJ is greater than PTUP and PTDOWN-ADJ is also greater than PTDOWN-<br>
Conversely, if BRNEXT is below BRAVE, then PTUP-ADJ is less than PTUP and PTDOWN-ADJ is<br>
also less than PTDOWN.<br>
The thresholds are illustrated in Fig. 6, which provides a block diagram representation of<br>
client buffer 115 of Fig. 1. In the example of Fig. 6, the adjustable thresholds are greater<br>
15<br><br>
than the corresponding fixed thresholds. Note that circumstances can potentially arise<br>
where PTUP-ADJ may be calculated to be greater than the maximum value of client buffer<br>
(MAX). This may occur if BRNEXT is quite a bit larger than BRAVE, yielding a high value<br>
for F. If that is the case, than PTUP-ADJ is simply set equal to MAX or to some other lesser,<br>
default value. In the extremely unlikely case that PTDOWN-ADJ is also calculated to be<br>
greater than MAX due to an extremely high value for F, then PTDOWN-ADJ is preferably also<br>
set to some default value, which is less than the default value to which PTUP-ADJ is set, thus<br>
assuring that PTDOWN-ADJ remains less than PTUP-ADJ-<br>
Returning to Fig. 5, at step 308, the server begins determining values for PT, i.e. the<br>
current playout length of data already contained within the client buffer, tracked at step<br>
204 of Fig. 2. If, at decision step 310, PT is greater than PTDOWN and PT is also greater<br>
than PTUP-ADJ, then an up-switch is triggered at step 312. If not, then decision step 314 is<br>
performed wherein, if PT is less than PTDOWN or PT is less than PTDOWN-ADJ, then a down-<br>
switch is triggered at step 316.<br>
The logic of decision steps 310 and 316 may be represented as follows:<br>
If PT &gt; PTDOWN AND PT &gt; PTUP.ADJ then<br>
Perform up-switch<br>
else<br>
if PT 
Perform down-switch<br>
end if<br>
where, as noted,<br>
PTUP-ADJ = PTUP*F and<br>
PTDOWN-ADJ = PTDOWN*F-<br>
Hence, an up-switch is triggered if the current playout length (PT) of the client buffer<br>
exceeds the adjustable up-switch threshold (PTUP-ADJ), assuming that PT also exceeds<br>
PTDOWN- This latter condition prevents inappropriate up-switches in circumstances where a<br>
down-switch may be more appropriate. By triggering up-switches based upon the<br>
16<br><br>
adjustable up-switch threshold, rather than on the fixed up-switch threshold, the server<br>
thereby takes into account the current status of the client buffer (as represented by PT)<br>
while also anticipating changes in bit rate within the variable bit rate data stream (via the<br>
adjustment of the up-switch threshold). This helps prevent other inappropriate up-<br>
switches.<br>
Consider an example wherein the adjustable up-switch threshold is initially exactly equal<br>
to the fixed up-switch threshold. Hence, if the playout length of client buffer exceeds that<br>
threshold level, an up-switch is performed. If the bit rate of the variable bit rate data is then<br>
due to increase, the adjustable up-switch threshold will be increased so as to the greater<br>
than the fixed threshold. In that case, a further up-switch will only be performed if the<br>
playout length exceeds the new, higher threshold value. In other words, it becomes more<br>
difficult for an up-switch to be triggered since a higher threshold value must be exceeded<br>
thus delaying further up-switches in circumstances where such a delay is warranted, as<br>
discussed above in connection with Fig. 1. Now consider an example wherein the<br>
adjustable up-switch threshold is again initially set equal to the fixed up-switch threshold<br>
but wherein the bit rate of the variable bit rate data is instead due to decrease. In the case,<br>
the adjustable up-switch threshold will then be lower than the fixed threshold. In that case,<br>
it becomes easier for an up-switch to be triggered thus expediting further up-switches in<br>
circumstances where one is warranted, as also discussed above.<br>
Turning now to down-switches, a down-switch is triggered if the current playout length<br>
(PT) of the client buffer falls below either the fixed threshold PTDOWN or the adjustable<br>
down-switch threshold (PTDOWN-ADJ)- In other words, a down-switch is triggered if PT falls<br>
below the larger of the two down-switch thresholds. The fixed threshold is still used to<br>
trigger a down-switch so as to prevent a down-switch from being delayed so as to help<br>
prevent rebuffering events. However, a down-switch can be expedited, which occurs if PT<br>
falls below the adjustable down-switch threshold. As noted above, the adjustable down-<br>
switch threshold may turn out to be either above or below the fixed down-switch<br>
threshold. If it is below the fixed threshold, it is superfluous, as the fixed threshold is used<br>
to immediately trigger a down-switch anyway. However, if the adjustable down-switch<br>
threshold exceeds the fixed down-switch threshold, the adjustable down-switch threshold<br>
can then trigger an expedited down-switch, i.e. it becomes easier for a down-switch to be<br>
triggered thus expediting further down-switches in circumstances where warranted, as also<br>
discussed above.<br>
If neither of the conditions of decision steps 310 and 314 are true, then processing returns<br>
to step 302, wherein the values of BRNEXT and BRAVE are updated to reflect any changes<br>
17<br><br>
therein, the adjustable thresholds are adjusted and the latest value for PT is input for<br>
applying to the various threshold values.<br>
Thus, an exemplary method implementation has been described of a technique for<br>
adjusting the overall transmission rate of data in a packet-based system by switching<br>
among different versions of a pre-encoded stream. The packet transmission rate typically is<br>
not changed, as it depends upon the bandwidth of the communication link. However, in<br>
other implementations, the packet transmission rate may be changed as well using, for<br>
example, adaptive techniques.<br>
Although the invention has been primarily described with reference to method<br>
implementations, apparatus implementations are also part of the invention. Figure 7<br>
illustrates, at a high-level, an exemplary apparatus implementation. Briefly, network<br>
component 400, which may be a part of server 105 of Fig. 1, includes an anticipatory<br>
variable bit rate stream transmission controller (402) for selecting (202) an initial version<br>
of a stream of variable bit rate data for transmission. A client buffer monitor (404) tracks a<br>
value representative of an amount of data within the client buffer. A variable bit rate<br>
determination unit (406) determines a bit rate (BR) of a portion of variable bit rate data yet<br>
to be transmitted within the selected version of the stream. The anticipatory variable bit<br>
rate stream transmission controller (402) then controls switches to different versions of the<br>
stream, having different mean bit rates, based on the value (PT) representative of the<br>
amount of data within the client buffer in combination with the bit rate (BR) of the portion<br>
of variable bit rate data yet to be transmitted, i.e. controller 402 anticipates changes in bit<br>
rate of the variable bit rate stream and controls up-switches and down-switches<br>
accordingly.<br>
As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the current invention and the<br>
techniques associated therewith provide an enhanced end user perceived experience for<br>
applications such as multimedia streaming by avoiding client buffer overflows.<br>
Furthermore, the skilled artisan will also appreciate that there are many different<br>
techniques that may be used to determine client buffer fill levels, including estimations<br>
based on data within RRs and Sender Reports, and that the current invention may be<br>
implemented in parallel with a plurality of data packet streams simultaneously being<br>
buffered for transmission to one or more clients.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that the invention may be<br>
implemented in and by various types of network components, such as network terminals,<br>
18<br><br>
network nodes, and the like. In particular, the invention may be practiced by mobile<br>
terminals, proxies (that could divide the transmission path), and fixed terminals.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to particular embodiments, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the specific<br>
embodiments described and illustrated herein. Therefore, while the invention has been<br>
described in relation to its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that this<br>
disclosure is only illustrative. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only<br>
by the scope of the claims appended hereto.<br>

18.	An apparatus (400) for controlling packet transmissions of variable bit rate data<br>
from a server (105) to a client (115) having a client buffer (155), wherein the server<br>
switches among different versions of a stream of variable bit rate data being transmitted<br>
based on a status of the client buffer, the apparatus comprising:<br>
an anticipatory variable bit rate stream transmission controller (402) for selecting<br>
(202) an initial version of a stream of variable bit rate data for transmission;<br>
22<br><br>
a client buffer monitor (404) for tracking a value representative of an amount of<br>
data within the client buffer;<br>
a variable bit rate determination unit (406) a bit rate (BR) of a portion of variable<br>
bit rate data yet to be transmitted within the selected version of the stream; and<br>
23<br>
wherein the anticipatory variable bit rate stream transmission controller (402) then<br>
controls switches to different versions of the stream, having different mean bit rates, based<br>
on the value (PT) representative of the amount of data within the client buffer in<br>
combination with the bit rate (BR) of the portion of variable bit rate data yet to be<br>
transmitted.<br><br>
A technique is disclosed for controlling data packet transmissions of variable bit rate data<br>
from a server to a client having a client buffer wherein the server switches among different<br>
versions of a stream of variable bit rate data being transmitted based on a status of the<br>
client buffer. The technique operates to select an initial version of a stream of variable bit<br>
rate data for transmission and to track a value representative of an amount of data within<br>
the client buffer. A bit rate of a next portion of variable bit rate data to be transmitted is<br>
determined. Then, the server controls switches to different versions of the stream, having<br>
different mean bit rates, based on the value representative of the amount of data within the<br>
client buffer in combination with the bit rate of the portion of variable bit rate data yet to<br>
be transmitted.<br></td>
