				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a tabletop sheeting and cutting device useful for Indian traditional sweets.<br>
The device of the present invention is particularly useful for sheeting and cutting of chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets in to different geometrical shapes. Geometrical shapes so obtained by using the device of the present invention are of uniform dimension and are obtained in intermittent manner. The chikki produced may have the ingredients, such as jaggery, peanuts, cardamom, sugar, liquid glucose etc. The device / machine of the present invention is therefore useful as a device / machine for sheeting and cutting of chikki and other Indian traditional sweets. Based on rotary cutter and a tray moving on an endless conveyor belt concept, a device / machine for sheeting and cutting of chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets untouched by hand is proposed for the first time according to this invention As an important traditional sweet in India, different varieties of chikki are produced in our country. They are more popular in India and they are considered as a delicacy and gaining popularity. There is liking for chikki along with other traditional sweets. One of the main problems in producing them in large scale is the tedious and skilled operations involved in their preparation.<br>
Attempt to produce machines for sheeting and cutting of chikki, is the first of its kind. The manufacturers are deprived of a suitable machine for large-scale preparation of chikki and depend on the skill of the chef/ laborers. In case a device / machine is made available for various operations involved in chikki preparations such as: jaggery syrup preparation, roasted peanut grating, jaggery syrup boiling, mixing of boiled syrup and the gratings, sheeting of hot mass and shaping the mass to different geometry, would result in reduction in labor and drudgery on the part of chefs / laborers and help in hygienic operations, and enhance uniformity in quality and quantities. Traditionally sheeting and cutting of chikki and other Indian traditional sweets are<br>
done manually by highly skilled chefs / laborers. Most of the production centers are cottage and tiny industries. Since the processing is done manually there is a scope for non-uniformity in colour, texture, size, geometry and unhygienic handling of the product. The sheeting and cutting of chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets are to be done in hot condition within specified time. Normally processing is done in a batch of 2 - 4 Kgs depending on the volume of sheeting and cutting tray. Traditionally sheeting and cutting of chikki and other Indian traditional sweets are done manually by chefs / skilled laborers. In order to overcome these difficulties, if a machine for sheeting and cutting of chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets is made available, it would mechanize large-scale production of chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets.<br>
Hitherto the process of preparation of chikki is based on manual cooking, sheeting and cutting. The filtered jaggery is heated in a pan to a temperature of 130 -140°C till the right consistency is obtained and roasted and grated peanut is added to the boiling syrup and mixed uniformly. The hot mass is transferred on to a tray and sheeted / rolled by using a pan. The sheeted / rolled chikki is cut to shape by using a blade and a straight edge. The sheeted / rolled and cut chikki allowed to cool. The cooled material is trimmed and packed for storage. The drawbacks of manual sheeting and cutting of chikkies are:<br>
&gt;	There is a variation in the quantity of the chikki.<br>
&gt;	Manual sheeting will lead to non-uniform product thickness.<br>
&gt;	The hot mass is difficult to handle.<br>
&gt;	The process is labor intensive and human drudgery is very high.<br>
&gt;	The final geometry of the product would depend on the skill of the chef/ labor.<br>
The main object of present invention is to provide a device for sheeting and cutting of<br>
chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets.<br>
Another object is to provide hygienic conditions through mechanized operation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device capable of working with a wide range of<br>
conventionally prepared Chikkies and other Indian traditional sweets.<br>
The device of the present invention overcomes most of the drawbacks of the existing<br>
method of manual sheeting and cutting of chikkies and other Indian traditional sweets.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for sheeting and cutting of chikii and other similar Indian traditional sweets comprising a roller with a geared motor (1) housed in the main frame (6) provided with necessary slots for accommodating the drive roller as well as the driven roller (9) and the conveyor belt (2) being characterized in that it being mounted on the said drive roller and the driven roller for conveying the wooden tray (4) for sheeting the chikki mass under the sheeting cum guiding roller (5) and to cut the sheeted chikki into uniform size and thickness by passing the wooden tray (4) against the rotary cutter assembly (3) and the said wooden tray (4) being guided by a set of guides (7) being placed below the said circular cutter at a predetermined speed of the drive roller and the speed of the drive being varied by using a speed variator (8)<br>
.In an embodiment of the present invention the material of the tray use is of any material and preferably of wood so as to reduce the wear of the circular cutter.<br>
In yet another embodiment the wooden tray used is preferably in square shape and is made of wood.<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having a roller with geared motor (1) for driving the driven roller (9) and the conveyor belt (2).<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having a rotary circular cutter assembly (3) housed inside a set of bush bearings for slicing / cutting the sheeted chikki and similar products.<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having a adjustable bolts to vary the depth (2mm to 12mm) of incision on the sheeted chikki and similar products.<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having a set of guides for guiding the wooden tray below the circular cutter (3).<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having a roller (5) to roll the hot mass (60 °C to 80° C) of the prepared chikki.<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a device having variable bolts for varying the thickness of the sheets.<br>
In still another embodiment the present invention provides a device having an electronic speed variator for varying the speed of the conveyor belt.<br>
We propose a tabletop sheeting and cutting device useful for Indian traditional sweets is proposed for the first time according to this invention. The invention is based on our finding that chikki and other similar Indian traditional sweets can be produced of known quantity under hygienic conditions using a specially designed machine. In the drawing accompanying this specification, fig 1 represents an embodiment of the device useful for making chikki and other Indian traditional sweets.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. The working of the sheeting and cutting machine is explained below with particular reference to peanut, jaggery-based chikki.<br>
Example<br>
Previously prepared and filtered jaggery syrup is heated and mixed in a pan till a temperature of 140° C is attained. The roasted and grated groundnut is added to the hot syrup in the ratio of 1:1 and mixed thoroughly. The mixed hot mass is transferred by using a ladle on to the tray made-up of wood. The wooden tray along with the hot mass of chikki is rested on the rotating conveyor belt. The rotating conveyor belt carries the hot mass along with the tray beneath the stationery roller. The roller flattens the hot mass on the wooden tray and carries the tray further against the rotating cutters. The wooden tray is moved out of the conveyor belt and rotated by 90°C and fed again on to the conveyor. The tray along with the chikki mass is further rolled on the conveyor<br>
and cut again by the rotating cutter perpendicular to the earlier direction of the cut. The sheeted and cut chikki is allowed to cool for 10 - 15 min. The cooled chikki is then removed from the wooden tray and packed.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
&gt;	The chikki and other similar Indian traditional foods can be automatically sheeted and cut to<br>
the required thickness.<br>
&gt;	Uniform quantity can be controlled easily.<br>
&gt;	The thickness can be maintained and varied easily.<br>
&gt;	The device is versatile and can efficiently handle different varieties of chikki and other<br>
Indian traditional sweets.Operation and maintenance is easy and cost effective too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
