MULTI-SPEED DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/873,646, filed on December 8, 2006. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to transmissions, and more particularly<br>
to a multiple speed transmission having a dual clutch assembly and dual countershafts.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] A typical' multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination of<br>
two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-on" or<br>
dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other, with the<br>
synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to actually making the<br>
dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow from the engine need not be<br>
interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept typically uses countershaft gears with<br>
a different, dedicated gear pair or set to achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly,<br>
the total number of gears required in this typical design is two times the number of<br>
forward speeds, plus three for reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear<br>
pairs, especially in transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed<br>
ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
[0004] The addition of clutches, brakes, and gear sets to achieve these gear<br>
ratios and torque ranges may result in inefficient or undesirable transmission weights and<br>
sizes. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a transmission having improved<br>
packaging while providing desirable gear ratios and torque ranges.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0028] FIG. 1 is a diagram of an embodiment of a multiple speed transmission<br>
according to the principles of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029] Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, in FIG. 1 a multi-speed transmission 10 is depicted. The transmission 10<br>
includes an input member 12 and output member 14. In the present embodiment, the<br>
input member 12 and the output member 14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the input and output members 12, 14 may be<br>
components other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is continuously connected with a torque<br>
converter 16 or other starting device. An engine (not shown) is connected to and<br>
provides a driving torque to the torque converter 16. The output shaft 14 is continuously<br>
connected with a final drive unit 18. The transmission 10 includes a countershaft gearing<br>
arrangement 20 that includes interconnecting shafts, countershafts, co-planar<br>
intermeshing gear sets and selectively engageable synchronizers as will be described<br>
herein. For example, the countershaft gearing arrangement 20 includes a first<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 22 and a second interconnecting shaft or member 24,<br>
which is preferably a sleeve shaft concentric with the first interconnecting shaft 22. The<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement 20 further includes a first countershaft 26 and a second<br>
countershaft 28. The countershafts 26 and 28 are both spaced apart from and parallel<br>
with the input shaft 12, the output shaft 14 and the interconnecting shafts 22, 24. The<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
output shaft 14, the interconnecting shafts 22, 24 and the countershafts 26, 28 are<br>
supported by a plurality of support members including a first housing member 27, a<br>
second housing member 29, and a third housing member 31. The housing members 27,<br>
29, 31 are fitted with bearings 33 for rotatably supporting the output shaft 14, the first and<br>
second interconnecting shafts 22, 24, and the countershafts 26, 28. In the embodiment<br>
provided, housing member 27 is disposed closest to the torque converter 16 and the final<br>
drive unit 18. Housing member 29 is disposed between housing member 27 and housing<br>

connected for common rotation with input shaft 12. Further, dual clutch 30 has first and<br>
second clutch elements or hubs 34 and 36. Clutch elements 34 and 36 together with<br>
housing 32 are configured to form a friction clutch, as well known in the art as a dual<br>
clutch. More specifically, clutch elements 34, 36 and clutch housing 32 have friction<br>
plates 35 mounted thereon that interact to form a friction clutch. Further, clutch element<br>
34 is connected for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and clutch<br>
element 36 is connected for common rotation with second interconnecting shaft 24.<br>
Thus, selective engagement of clutch element 34 with clutch housing 32 connects the<br>
input shaft 12 for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and selective<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 with clutch housing 32 connects the input shaft 12 for<br>
common rotation with second interconnecting shaft 24.<br>

[0036] Co-planar gear set 80 includes intermeshing gear 82 and gear 84. Gear<br>
82 is connected for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and intermeshes<br>
with gear 84. Gear 84 is selectively connectable for common rotation with second<br>
countershaft 28.<br>
[0037] Gear set 90 includes co-planar, intermeshing gear 92 and gear 94.<br>
Gear 92 is connected for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and<br>
intermeshes with gear 94. Gear 94 is selectively connectable for common rotation with<br>
the first countershaft 26.<br>
[0038] Gear set 100 includes co-planar, intermeshing gear 102, gear 104 and<br>

shaft 14. Gear 104 intermeshes with gear 106. Gear 106 is connected for common<br>
rotation with first countershaft 26.<br>
[0039] The transmission 10 further includes a plurality of selectively<br>
engageable synchronizers 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132 and 134. Synchronizers<br>
120/122, 124/126, 128/130, 132/134 are a left and right side of synchronizer assemblies,<br>
sharing a common synchronizer hub and sleeve. Synchronizer 120 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 44 with first countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith.<br>
Synchronizer 122 is selectively engageable to connect gear 66 with first countershaft 26<br>
for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 124 is selectively engageable to connect<br>
gear 52 with second countershaft 28 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 126 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect gear 64 with second countershaft 28 for common<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 128 is selectively engageable to connect gear 76 with<br>
first countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 130 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 94 with first countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith.<br>

common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 134 is selectively engageable to connect gear<br>
84 with second countershaft 28 for common rotation therewith.<br>
[0040] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one reverse<br>
torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is attained by<br>
engagement of dual clutch 30 and one of the clutch elements 34, 36 and one or more of<br>
the synchronizers 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132 and 134. Those skilled in the art will<br>
readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque ratio.<br>
[0041] To establish the reverse torque ratio, clutch element 36 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 124 are engaged. By this engagement, clutch element 36 of<br>
the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to<br>
the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred from the second<br>
interconnecting shaft 24 through gear 42 to idler gear 46. Idler gear 46 is connected for<br>
common rotation to idler gear 54. Idler gear 54 transfers the torque to gear 52. Upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 124, gear 52 transfers torque to second countershaft 28.<br>
Countershaft 28 transfers the torque to gear 102. Gear 102 transfers torque to gear 104,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
[0042] A first forward torque ratio (1st gear) is achieved by engaging clutch<br>
element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 130. By this engagement, clutch<br>
element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from the<br>
first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 92. Gear 92 transfers the torque to gear 94. Upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 130, gear 94 transfers torque to first countershaft 26. First<br>
countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 106. Gear 106 transfers torque to gear 104,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0043] A subsequent forward torque ratio (2nd gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 120. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 42. Gear 42 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 44. Upon engagement of synchronizer 120, gear 44 transfers torque to first<br>
countershaft 26. First countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 106. Gear 106<br>
transfers torque to gear 104, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output<br>
shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0044] A subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear) is established by engagement of<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 128. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 72. Gear 72 transfers the torque to gear 76.<br>
Upon engagement of synchronizer 128, gear 76 transfers torque to first countershaft 26.<br>
First countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 106. Gear 106 transfers torque to gear<br>
104, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the<br>
torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0045] A next subsequent forward torque ratio (4th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 122. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Torque is then<br>
transferred from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 62. Gear 62 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 66. Further, upon engagement of synchronizer 122, gear 66 transfers<br>
torque to first countershaft 26. First countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 106.<br>
Gear 106 transfers torque to gear 104, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft<br>
14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0046] A subsequent torque ratio (5th gear) is established by engagement of<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 132. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Torque is then transferred from<br>
shaft 22 to the gear 72. Gear 72 transfers the torque to gear 74. Further, upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 132 the torque is transferred from the gear 74 to countershaft<br>
28. Second countershaft 28 transfers the torque to gear 102. Gear 102 transfers torque to<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
gear 104, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers<br>
the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0047] A subsequent torque ratio (6th gear) is established by engagement of<br>
clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 126. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred<br>
from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 62. Gear 62 transfers the torque to gear<br>
64. Further, upon engagement of synchronizer 126 the torque is transferred from the gear<br>
64 to the second countershaft 28. Second countershaft 28 transfers the torque to gear<br>
102. Gear 102 transfers torque to gear 104, which in turn transfers the torque to output<br>
shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0048] A subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement of<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 134. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 82. Gear 82 transfers the torque to gear 84.<br>
Further, upon engagement of synchronizer 134 the torque is transferred from the gear 84<br>
to the second countershaft 28. Gear 84 transfers torque to second countershaft 28.<br>
Second countershaft 28 transfers the torque to gear 102. Gear 102 transfers torque to<br>
gear 104, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers<br>
the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000365-PTT-DLT<br>
[0049] The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios (i.e.,<br>
the ratio of torque of the output member 14 to the input member 12) are achievable<br>
through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10. Moreover, the<br>
present invention advantageously provides the transfer gears 102, 104 and 106 in a single<br>
plane. This arrangement provides the opportunity to achieve reduced transmission length<br>
in comparison with double plane transfer gears. Further, flexibility is provided in the<br>
selection of gear ratios with respect to 1 st, 2nd and 7th gear, which utilize single mesh<br>
pinions (i.e. separate pinions for each gear). The double idler for the reverse gears<br>
provides very good opportunity/flexibility to achieve the desired reverse gear ratios.<br>
[0050] In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a parking gear<br>
150 is provided. Parking gear 150, as shown in FIG. 1, is connected for common rotation<br>
with output shaft 14. Upon activation of a parking actuator (not shown) parking gear 150<br>
is rotationally fixed and, thus, prevents output shaft 14 from rotating. The present<br>
invention contemplates that parking gear 150 may be located at other locations along<br>
output shaft 14.<br>
[0051] While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention<br>
within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
