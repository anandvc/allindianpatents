COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SUBSTITUTED 4-PYRAZOLYLPYRAZOLINES"<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AG, a German company of Alfred-Nobel-Str. 50, 40789 Monheim, Germany,<br><br><br><br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries Nk/Nk/NT<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted 4-pyrazolylpyrazolines, to a process for their preparation and to their use as pesticides.<br>
It is known that certain substituted 4-pyrazolylpyrazolines have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf., for example, DE-A44 16 112, EP-A 0 679 644 or EP-A 0 438 690). However, the activity of these compounds is, in particular at low active compound concentrations and application rates, not always entirely satisfactory.<br>
This invention provides novel substituted 4-pyrazolylpyrazolines of the formula (I)<br>
  (I)<br>
in which<br>
R1       represents optionally substituted hetaryl,<br>
R2       represents halogen, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, alkylsulphonyl, haloalkylsulphinyl, haloalkylsulphonyl or cyano,<br>
R3       represents halogen, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, haloalkylsulphinyl, haloalkylsulphonyl or cyano and<br>
R4       represents hydrogen, cyanomethyl or alkoxycarbonyl.<br>
Depending on the nature and number of substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can, if appropriate, be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers, regioisomers<br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
and/or configurational isomers or isomer mixtures thereof of varying compositions. What is claimed by the invention are both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the substituted pyrazolines of the formula (I) are obtained when<br>
a)        pyrazolines of the formula (II)<br><br><br>
(II)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are as defined above<br>
are reacted with isocyanates of the formula (III)<br>
  (III)<br>
in which<br>
R3       is as defined above,<br>
if appropriate in the presence of a diluent and if appropriate in the presence of a catalyst;<br>
and<br>
b)        the resulting pyrazoline derivatives of the formula (la) according to the invention<br><br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
  (la)<br>
in which<br>
R1,R2 and R3 are as defined above<br>
are, if appropriate, reacted with halides of the formula (IV)<br>
Hal1—R4	(IV)<br>
in which<br>
R4       is as defined above and<br>
Hal1    represents halogen,<br>
if appropriate in the presence of a diluent and if appropriate in the presence of a base; or<br>
c)        anilines of the formula (V)<br>
  (V)<br>
in which<br>
R3 and R4 are as defined above<br>
are initially reacted with phosgene in the presence of a diluent and, if appropriate, in the presence of a base, and the resulting carbamoyl chlorides of the formula (VI)<br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br><br><br>
(VI)<br><br>
in which<br><br>
R and R are as defined above<br>
are, directly or after intermediate isolation, reacted with pyrazolines of the formula (II)<br>
(II)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are as defined above,<br>
in the presence of a diluent and, if appropriate, in the presence of a base.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the novel substituted 4-pyrazolylpyrazolines of the formula (I) have strongly pronounced biological properties and are suitable especially for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes, encounted in agriculture, in forests, in the protection of stored products and materials and in the hygiene sector.<br>

Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders" rights. Plant parts are to be understood to mean all above-ground and underground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br><br><br>

Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and<br><br><br><br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators is also possible.<br><br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present when used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. This can be varieties, bio- and genotypes.<br><br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageously useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also<br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still-to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br><br><br>

At 70°C, 0.6 g (3 mmol) of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl isocyanate is added to a mixture of 1.1 g (3 mmol) of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazole, 0.1ml of triethylamine and 50 ml of methyl-tert-amyl ether. The mixture is stirred at 70°C for 15 minutes and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The solvent is then distilled off under reduced pressure and the residue is purified by silica gel chromatography (methylene chloride/diethyl ether 5:1).<br>
This gives 1.1 g (64% of theory) of N-(4-trifluoromethoxy)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-t4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4,5-dihydro-l-pyrazolecarboxanilide of logP (pH 2) = 4.63.<br><br>

At room temperature, 1.5 g (0.015 mol) of bis-dimethylaminomethane are added to a solution of 4.9 g (0.014 mol) of 2-[4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4"-chloroacetophenone in 50 ml of methylene chloride, and the mixture is boiled under reflux for 18 hours. The solvent is then distilled off under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol. 0.8 g (0.016 mol) of hydrazine hydrate is added, and the reaction mixture is then stirred at 30°C for 3 hours. About 200 ml of water are then added, and the precipitated product is filtered off with suction.<br>

Preparation of the precursor<br><br><br><br><br>
A    mixture    of    4.3 g    (0.015 mol)    of    2-[4-(tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4"-chloroacetophenone, 6.8 g of tert-butanol, 0.8 g of cone, sulphuric acid and 60 ml of<br><br>
Le A 35 964-Foreign Countries<br>
trifluoroacetic acid is stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent is then distilled off under reduced pressure, about 100 ml of water are added to the residue and the mixture is neutralized using sodium bicarbonate. The precipitated product is filtered off with suction and washed with water.<br>
This gives 4.9 g (95% of theory) of 2-[4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4"-chloroacetophenone in the form of colourless crystals of logP (pH 2) = 2.96.<br><br><br><br><br>
A mixture of 14.75 g (0.06 mol) of 2-(4-cyanopyrazol-l-yl)-4"-chloroacetophenone, 17.4 g (0.126 mol) of triethylamine hydrochloride, 8.4 g (0.126 mol) of sodium azide and 100 ml of toluene is boiled under reflux for 16 hours. The solvent is then distilled off under reduced pressure, the residue is dissolved in 200 ml of about 5% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and insoluble particles are filtered off. The filtrate is adjusted to about pH2 using dilute hydrochloric acid and the precipitated product is then filtered off and washed with water.<br>
This gives 15.3 g (88% of theory) of 2-[4-(tetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4"-chloroacetophenone of logP (pH 2) = 1.60.<br><br><br>

Example 2<br><br><br><br>
(Process c)<br>
At 0°C, 1 g (3.6 mmol) of N-cyanomethyl-N-(4-trifluoromethoxy)phenylcarbamoyl chloride is added dropwise to a solution of 1.1 g (3 mmol) of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazole [Ex. H-l] and 0.5 ml (3.6 mmol) of triethylamine in 30 ml of methylene chloride, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 hours. The mixture is washed twice with in each case 100 ml of water and the organic phase is dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by silica gel chromatography (methylene chloride/diethyl ether = 10:1).<br>
This gives 1.1 g (61% of theory) of N-cyanomethyl-N(4-trifluoromethoxy)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-[4-(2-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)pyrazol-l-yl]-4,5-dihydro-l-pyrazolecarboxanilide of logP (pH 2) = 4.40.<br>
