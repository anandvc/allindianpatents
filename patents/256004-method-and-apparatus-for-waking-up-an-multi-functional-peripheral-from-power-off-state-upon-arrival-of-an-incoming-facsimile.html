				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to Multi Function Peripherals. Particularly the present invention relates to a method of saving power in the facsimile machine. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of waking up MFP to receive the incoming fax.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Fax machine has become an essential requirement in today's commercial life style. Since the fax data transmission is a random process and the arrival of data is unpredictable, they are having some practical constraints. Firstly unless the fax machine is in its power- on state the information will not be received and the data will be lost. Secondly the life of the electronic components in the machine reduces since the machine is always made live. Thirdly the machine always consumes a specified amount of power, because of its unpredictable nature of the arrival of the fax job. US patent number US7007182B1, titled,"Communication terminal and facsimile apparatus connected to an analog communication network and provided with a power management feature", describes a facsimile communication system that can be kept in a power-off mode when not in use and can be put into a power-on mode when an incoming fax call is detected. The facsimile communication system comprises a data access arrangement (DAA) that detects an incoming call and transfers the call to the modem. If the incoming call refers to a fax related call, the modem sends a signal to the power-saving control device that brings the facsimile into the power-<br><br>
on mode. As mentioned in the publication, the facsimile can be in the power-off mode or a power-save mode when not in use. However, the publication does not explicitly mention the use of a high Q-band pass filter or a FV converter to implement the above functionality.<br>
Another US patent numbered US5894508A , titled, "Automatic power control apparatus of a PC mounted fax/modem", describes a system for automatically turning on a PC from a power-off condition, when a fax/modem data is received. The system includes a ring detection section and a ring counter section. Flip-flops are used to send signal to a power switch section which in turn is used to supply power from the AC supply to a PC power source section. However, the publication does not explicitly mention the use of a high Q-band pass filter or a FV converter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a method of waking up of MFP to receive the fax, which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to inform the MFP about the incoming of a fax call even if the facsimile machine is switched off.<br>
It is another object of the invention to save great amount of power which is wasted while MFP is in the wait state.<br><br>
It is yet another object of the invention to increase the life of the electronic components in the MFP by making it off in unused state.<br>
The further objects of the invention will  be apparent from the following descriptions.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the method for reducing the power consumption by the facsimile machine by keeping it in power-off stage, when not in use. The method uses an electronic circuitry where in the modem is always made live and whenever it senses a call related to the fax, it immediately sends an acknowledgement signal to the proposed electronic circuitry to perform its job. Basically the proposed electronic circuitry generates the desired voltage signal which is useful to power-on the MFP. The time in the call making and capability transfer is managed in such a manner that it is sufficient to make the MFP ready from the power-off state.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for waking up MFP to receive the fax comprising the steps of:<br>
detecting an incoming ring signal and informing the said signal to a<br>
modem by a ring detector;<br>
finding if the incoming ring signal is a fax call by the said modem;<br>
checking if the MFP is in the power-off state;<br>
sending the ACK signal to an oscillator if the said MFP is in the power-off<br>
state by the modem;<br>
generating a signal of specific frequency on receiving the ACK signal by<br><br>
the oscillator;<br>
sending the signal of specific frequency to a Frequency to voltage converter for generating corresponding voltage; and sending the generated voltage to the SMPS to switch on the MFP, where the MFP starts receiving the fax when switched on.<br>
As soon as the modem senses the Fax related frequency, the said modem sends an acknowledgement to the oscillator and starts capability exchange session The MFP warms up and becomes ready for data exchange before the session goes time-out.<br>
Accordingly this invention also explains a system for waking up MFP to receive the fax comprising:<br>
a ring detector for detecting an incoming ring signal;<br>
a modem to which the said signal is informed;<br>
means for finding if the incoming ring signal is a fax call by the said<br>
modem;<br>
means for checking if the MFP is in the power-off state;<br>
an oscillator which receives an ACK signal from the modem if the said<br>
MFP is in the power-off state;<br>
means for generating a signal of specific frequency on receiving the ACK<br>
signal by the oscillator;<br>
a Frequency to voltage converter for generating corresponding voltage<br>
from the signal of specific frequency; and<br>
SMPS which receives the  said generated voltage and which  switches<br><br>
ON the MFP, where the MFP starts receiving the fax when switched on.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the basic structure of the operation with the control flow diagram.<br>
Figure 2 is the flow chart showing the signal flow in the proposed invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The invention relates to MFP and particularly to the method for reducing the power consumption in facsimile machine by keeping it in power-off state, when not in use. According to the proposed method, signals are generated to inform the MFP about the arrival of the fax data, even if it is in its power-off state.<br><br>
The basic structure of this invention is shown in the control flow diagram as in Figure 1. The system elements of the invention mainly include a ring detector, a modem, an oscillator, a frequency-to-voltage converter, an SMPS and an MFP with fax technology. When the ring detector detects an incoming call, it sends the call signal to the modem. The modem determines if the incoming call is a fax call. If the call is a fax call, then the modem sends an acknowledgement to the electronic circuitry. The electronic circuitry switches on the power of the facsimile which was otherwise kept in a power-off state. The facsimile apparatus then warms up and becomes ready for data exchange before the session goes timeout. The electronic circuitry comprises an oscillator and a frequency-to-voltage (f/v) generator. When the modem detects a fax message, it sends an acknowledgement signal to the oscillator Upon receiving the acknowledgement signal from the modem, the oscillator generates a specific frequency which is used by the f/v generator to produce a voltage pulse. The voltage pulse is used by the SMPS (Switching Mode Power Supply) in order to bring the facsimile into a power-on state. The high Q band pass filter is use to filter the selected band of frequency (near by 1100Hz). The main use of it in the circuit it to protect the system from the accidental trigger. It sends (Pass) signal to the oscillator only, if it receives the frequency similar(same) to the connection making signal for FAX. DMU (Device Management Unit) comes between the SMPS and MFP. The main work of this unit to manage the sequence of Power-on-signal given to the different part of MFP in order to make it able to receive the FAX.<br>
Referring to figure 2 it shows the signal flow of the operation of the present invention. The ring detector unit detects the incoming ring signal and informs the<br><br>
modem about it. Once the modem finds that the incoming call is a fax call, it checks whether the MFP is in the power-off state or not. If it is in the power-off state, the modem sends the ACK signal to the oscillator or else it starts receiving the fax and finishes the job. The oscillator on receiving the ACK signal generates a signal of specific frequency, which is then send to the Frequency to voltage converter. The generated voltage is then sent to the SMPS to switch on the MFP and start receiving the fax.<br>
According to the ITU standards there are five phases involved in the complete fax process. T30 is targeted for fax application as fax handshaking protocol. It will establish and manage communications between two fax modems. There are five phases of operation covered: call set up, pre message procedure (selecting the communication mode), message transmission (including phasing and synchronization), post message procedure and call release.<br>
The control circuit starts operating after the starting of the phase A which is the connection making phase. According to the ITU standards the time out of the phase A is 60 + 5. For the successful reception of the Fax the MFP should be brought in the ready condition from the off condition and generally MFP takes 30 to 35 seconds time to come in ready condition from the off condition. So, for the successful fax reception the Warm-up time of the MFP should be handled properly with the Phase A time out.<br>
The Modem, as soon as sensing the Fax related frequency, it sends an acknowledgement to the oscillator and start capability exchange after 40 - 45<br><br>
seconds from the reception of the Fax related frequency. During this time MFP will be capable of receiving the fax.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
