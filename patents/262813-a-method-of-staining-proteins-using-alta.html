				<td>A METHOD OF STAINING PROTEINS USING ALTA<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of staining proteins using alta and a kit for staining the proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is one of the widely used methods for analysis and characterization of proteins in life science research. Realizing its importance and various applications, due efforts are continuously being made to improve on this method. Among various parameters, detection of protein bands following electrophoretic separation has drawn a great deal of attention. Generally, visualization of protein bands involves staining of the proteins by protein-specific stains followed by destaining of the gels to obtain a clear background. For example, the standard Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-staining procedure involves immersing the gel in a solution of methanol/acetic acid/water containing 0.1% CBB R-250 followed by destaining with the same solution without the stain . Although various methods of staining and destaining of proteins on gels have been described, a continuous update on the use of new stains and procedures are appreciated by researchers in this field.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses the use of a pre-existing scarlet red stain of cosmetic use, called Alta, for staining SDS polyacrylamide gels and nitrocellulose membranes. This stain is easy to use, inexpensive (requires only 10% solution of Alta) and the destaining procedure requires only low concentration of acetic acid as compared to the conventional de-stainer containing methanol/acetic acid/water. Further, for Western blot analysis, addition of 5% Alta in the top tank buffer is enough to monitor the protein profile on the gel, as well as on the nitrocellulose membrane after electrotransfer, simply by viewing fluorescence on a UV-transilluminator. This method thus eliminates<br>
the need to run separate gels for protein staining on gel and for Western blot analysis, thereby reducing the time and expense for Western blot analysis.<br>

each set 20, 30 and 40 Ag proteins were loaded.<br>
The invention is further extrapolated with the help of following examples. However, this<br>
should not be considered to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Example 1- Analysis of composition of Alta by HPLC:<br>
HPLC analysis of Alta was carried out using MERCK-HITACHI HPLC system in combination with photodiode array detector (MERCK-HITACHI L-7455) with a wavelength range from 180 to 800 run. The samples were analysed using C-18 (Nucleosil) column (12.5 cm) at 25 8C. The solvent used for eluting the samples was 1 mM ammonium acetate in methanol and water (1:1, v/v). The flow rate was set at 0.6 ml/min<br>
in isocratic condition. The detection wavelength was set from 250 to 650 nm and absorbances of the samples were monitored at 285 nm. All the systems were interfaced to a computer and the raw data were analysed by using the software Multi-HSM-D7000.<br>
Example 2- Protein extraction and estimation of protein concentrations:<br>
Protein samples used in these experiments were from four sources, namely, in vitro cultured mouse melanoma cells (B16F10), human K562 cells, 19-day-old chick embryo liver and chickpea. Proteins were extracted in the lysis buffer containing the following: 20 raM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min and the soluble supernatants were used for analysis. Protein concentrations in the samples were estimated by the micro method of Bradford BSA was used as the standard protein. Example 3- SDS-PAGE and protein staining<br>
Samples containing 20, 30 and 50 Ag proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) according to Laemmli. The following proteins were used as the molecular weight marker proteins: myosin (205 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa) and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). Electrophoresis of proteins in two identical gels was carried out at a constant current of 20 mA for 1 h. Staining and destaining of one gel was carried out by the standard CBB staining procedure [staining in 0.1% CBB R-250 dissolved in methanol/acetic acid/water (5:1:4) for 2 h followed by destaining in the same solution without the stain for 10-12 h]. While the other gel was stained in Alta solution mixed with methanol and acetic acid (4:5:1) for 2 h, and destained in 7% acetic acid for 20 h. In separate experiments, gels were also stained with a mixture of 0.8% Crocein scarlet (brilliant crocein) and 0.2% Rhodamine B, prepared in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. These concentrations are chosen as per their concentrations in Alta solution, determined by HPLC analysis.<br>
Example 4- Western blot analysis<br>
Protein samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Alta stain was added in the top tank buffer to a final concentration of 5% v/v (0.4% Crocein scarlet and 0.1%<br>
Rhodamine B) before electrophoresis. Following the electrophoresis, the gel was viewed 100 on a UV-transilluminator and the protein profile was recorded on a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA). Thereafter, the gel was transferred in a wet electrotransfer system (70 mA, 16 h), according to Towbin et al. Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was viewed on a UV-transilluminator, profile recorded and processed further for immunoreaction as follows. The membrane was saturated with 3% BSA for 4 h, reacted with anti-HSP70 mouse monoclonal antibody, followed by anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase as the secondary antibody. The blot was developed using BCIP and NBT as the substrates and the results photographed.<br>
Example 5- Chemical composition of Alta determined by HPLC analysis:<br>
The HPLC chromatogram of 1:15 diluted Alta solution showed three distinct peaks with retention times 1.39, 1.79 and 6.6 min (Fig. 1A). These peaks correspond to the retention time of 1.79 min of Rhodamine B (0.24 mg/ml) and with retention time of 1.39 and 6.6 min of Crocein scarlet (0.56 mg/ml) as seen in Fig. IB and C, respectively.<br>
The results indicated that the spectra of the peaks of Alta were identical to those of Rhodamine B (1.79 min) and those of Crocein scarlet (1.39 and 6.6 min) suggesting that<br>
Crocein scarlet and Rhodamine B are the constituents of Alta. Similar chemical<br>
composition of Alta has been reported earlier Spiking was carried out using the standards, Rhodamine B and Crocein scarlet, to further confirm the composition of Alta. The HPLC chromatogram of spiked Alta with each of the standards showed an increase in intensity of the respective peaks proportion-ally with the concentration of the standards added, thereby confirming that Alta consists of two dyes, Crocein scarlet and Rhodamine B. Further, the concentrations of Crocein scarlet and Rhodamine B in Alta are 8 and 2 mg/ml, respectively, as calculated from the areas of the peaks.<br>
Example 6- Protein profile stained by Alta and its comparison with that stained by CBB-250:<br>
The resolution of the protein samples in the gel stained by Alta appeared similar<br>
to that stained by CBB (Fig. 2A,B). The resolution remained unaffected irrespective of<br>
the type of protein samples used, including the standard molecular weight marker<br>
proteins. Further, the binding of the stain Alta to protein bands appeared to increase as a function of protein concentration, as was observed in case of the CBB stain. However, destaining of the Alta-stained gel by the standard destaining procedure used for CBB-stained gel led to a significant loss of staining of the protein bands. Interestingly, destaining with 7% acetic acid alone was much more effective. Similar results were obtained for the total tissue/cell extracts (Fig. 2; data on scanning )When the cost of these two staining procedures was estimated, Alta-staining was found to be about three-times cheaper as compared to the CBB-staining procedure. It was observed that this procedure is equally efficient for non- denaturing polyacrylamide gels. After having identified the components of Alta, the staining gels was done with a mixture of 0.8% (w/v) Crocein scarlet and 0.2% (w/v) Rhodamine B prepared in methanol/ acetic acid/water (50:10:40). Upon comparison, it was observed that the protein profile obtained with this solution was identical to that obtained by Alta (Fig. 4).<br>
These results together further confirm the composition of Alta, and also indicate that these components in a proportion of 80:20 may be universally used as an alternative procedure for protein staining.<br>
Use of Alta for monitoring protein profile on gel and on nitrocellulose membrane during Western blot analysis:<br>
Alta can also be used at a much lower concentration (5% v/v; half the concentration required for direct Alta staining on gel) for Western blot analysis. Since one of the components of Alta (Rhodamine B) is a chromofluor, the protein profile can be continuously monitored simply by viewing under a UV-transilluminator, at each step during the process, namely, after electrophoresis (Fig. 5A) and after electrotransfer on nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 5B). The protein bands (red coloured due to Crocein scarlet) can be better observed against a fluorescent background (Rhodamine B). Further, this nitro- cellulose membrane can be processed further for immunoreaction leading to development of signal without any interference by the background stain (Fig. 5C); the background stain fades during the process of Western blot.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
(1)	Since no organic solvent is used, no interference of antigen-antibody interactions, thereby any compromise in the intensity of signal in the Western blot was observed.<br>
(2)	Since the stain is retained on the nitrocellulose membrane after transfer, monitoring of protein transfer by Ponceau Red S staining becomes redundant.<br>
(3)	Due to non-requirement of a few steps, the entire procedure is simple and short, and<br>
time-saving.<br>
(4)	The cost of individual experiments is reduced substantially as it eliminates the need to<br>
run two separate gels, one for staining and the other for Western blot, as done in the<br>
conventional approach. Our results thus suggest that this newly described staining<br>
procedure could be used as an alternative to the existing staining procedures including<br>
CBB-staining. This stain is highly inexpensive, available in the form of a ready-to-use<br>
stain, and thus may find its application in the area of protein electrophoresis and Western<br>
blot analysis.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
