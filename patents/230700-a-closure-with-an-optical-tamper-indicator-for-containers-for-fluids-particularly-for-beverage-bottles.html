CLOSURE WITH AN OPTICAL TAMPER INDICATOR, FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES<br>
Title: "A closure with an optical tamper indicator, for alcoholic beverage bottles"<br>
The present invention relates to a closure with an optical tamper indicator for containers for fluids, particularly for alcoholic beverage bottles provided with an opening delimited by the free end of a neck which extends axially from the body of the bottle along a longitudinal axis and which has an outer surface, the closure comprising:<br>
- a cap having a top wall arranged transverse the longitudinal axis,<br>
- a tubular skixt connected to the edge of the top wall and extending axially along the outer surface of the neck towards the body of the bottle, the tubular skirt being provided with an internal thread which engages an external thread provided on the outer surface of the neck,<br>
- means for opening and closing the interior of the bottle as a result of the screwing and unscrewing of the<br><br>
cap, the means being provided on the top wall of the cap.<br>
As is known, the problem of providing evidence of tampering with a bottle closure, particularly in bottles for good-quality alcoholic averages, is experienced to a large extent especially in the large-scale distribution sales sector in which the bottles are displayed on shelves disposed in poorly guarded premises in which the possibility of a potential customer opening the bottle and then, instead purchasing it, replacing it on the shelf and going_away, cannot be excluded.<br>
Clearly, a subsequent customer who is not suitably made aware runs the risk of purchasing a bottle the closure of which has already been opened and then fraudulently re -closed and which has been left on the shelf.<br>
Various technical solutions have been devised and used to avoid these risks and to guarantee to customers that purchased products are always intact; these solutions are mainly based on the use of seals which are placed on the closures or caps and which, once the first opening of the bottle closure has been performed are not intact, proving to the purchaser that the closure has already been opened for the first time.<br><br>
Technical solutions have also been proposed in which the previously opened condition is indicated by means which modify their optical condition when they are subjected to mechanical actions which occur upon the first opening of the closure.<br>
An example of such means is described in WO 02/090204 Al.<br>
According to the technical solution described in the above-mentioned" document, the closure has a housing in which a capsule containing a first chemical reagent and a substrate containing a second reagent are disposed. The first reagent contained in the capsule has a first coloration and is visible through the top wall of the cap, which is -rendered suitably transparent. Upon the first opening of the closure, the axial movement of a portion of the cap causes movement of a structural element of the closure which brings about compression and then breakage of the capsule and the consequent release of the first reagent. The first reagent reacts with the second reagent contained in the substrate, causing an irreversible colour change which is adopted as a signal that the first opening has taken place and which is visible from the exterior of the closure so as to warn<br><br>
the purchaser.<br>
The technical solution disclosed in the above-mentioned document has the disadvantage that it makes the previously opened condition of the closure visible through the upper wall of the cap which cannot easily be seen by a purchaser, particularly if the bottles are placed on high shelves of a display unit.<br>
Moreover, since the reagent from the capsule reaches that of the substrate purely by gravity, any opening operation performed with the bottle held upside down may be detrimental to the achievement of the desired effect.<br>
Finally, the closure structures described in WO 01/090204 do not ensure that, if the closure is removed from the neck of the bottle axially, the relative movement between the elements which bring about the breakage of the capsule and the release of the first reagent will nevertheless take place, with the result that the closure could be reused.<br>
Other similar technical solutions are also described in WO 99/24329, in US-A-5,265,744, and in US-A-4,480,760. In particular, the closure described in US-A-5,265,744<br><br>
has the purpose of making the previously opened condition of the closure also visible from the side but the technical solution envisaged involves the arrangement of a plurality of small openings in the side wall of the closure and the use of a light beam emitted by a portable lamp in order to investigate, through the above-mentioned small holes, the optical conditions of the breakable capsule disposed inside the closure.<br>
Whereas a technical solution of this type can be used by sales personnel to check which bottles on the shelves have been opened, it is clearly not suitable for normal potential purchasers.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a closure having an optical indicator for indicating that the first opening has taken place, in which the sign that is indicative of opening is visible laterally through the side wall of the cap, at one or more points of the cap, and becomes visible even if the closure is removed from the neck of the bottle axially or is opened with the bottle held upside down, by attempted forcing.<br>
This object  is  achieved by a closure of the  type<br><br>
indicated  in  the  introduction and characterised  in accordance with the appended claims.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to some preferred embodiments thereof which are illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the appended drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 16 shows the closure of Figure 14 in the condition<br><br>
adopted after the first opening,<br>
Figure 17 is a section taken on the line XVII-XVII of Figure 16, and _<br>
Figure 18 shows the closure of Figure 14 opened and completely removed from the neck of the bottle.<br>
With reference to the above-mentioned drawings., the neck of a bottle is indicated 1 and the body of the bottle is indicated 2. The neck 1 extends longitudinally from the body 2 along a longitudinal axis X-X and has an outer surface 3. The free end 4 of the neck 1 defines an opening 5 and has an annular step 6 on the outer side.<br>
The outer surface 3 of the neck 1 has a thread 7 in an intermediate position between the free end 4 and the body 2 • The thread 7 may be formed directly on the surface itself or, as in the embodiment shown in the drawings, may be carried by a tubular sleeve 8 fitted on the neck 1 and fixed firmly thereto by conventional means, generally indicated 9, which prevent axial and angular movements.<br>
The closure comprises a cap, which is generally indicated 10 and is constituted by a top wall 11 having a<br><br>
peripheral edge 12 and arranged transverse the longitudinal axis X-X, and by a tubular skirt 13. The skirt 13 extends axially along the outer surface 3 of the neck 1 from the peripheral edge 12 of the wall 11 substantially as far as the region in which the neck 1 extends from the body 2 of the bottle.<br>
The tubular skirt 13 of the cap 10 comprises two portions, indicated 13a and 13b, the first of which is near to the top wall 11 and the second 13b of which is near to the body 2 of the bottle.<br>
The portions 13a and 13b may represent two distinct parts of the tubular skirt 13 which are fixed to one another axially, for example, by means of conventional chemical or ultrasound welding on the j oining line 13 c, or two regions of a tubular skirt manufactured as a single part.<br>
The portion 13a of the skirt 13 is normally made of plastics material which can confer on the wall the characteristic of being completely or at least partially transparent, in the ways which will become clear from the following description.<br>
The portion 13b, on the other hand, is intended to be<br><br>
A second element 22 is arranged in a position concentric with the annular element 21 and, in the first embodiment of the invention, is in the form of a plurality of circular sectors distributed around the circumference of the closure and fitted in the respective openings 19 that are present between the collars 16 and 17. The elements 22 are connected to the element 21 by respective radial bridges. 23 positioned in the region of the ends 22a and 21a that face towards the top wall 11 of the cap 10 and each element 22 is connected to the step 6 of the rim of the neck 1 by means of a lip 22c positioned at the opposite end 22b.<br>
It is clear from the foregoing that any axial movement of each element 22 towards the top wall 11 of the cap, against which the radial connecting bridges 23 are also positioned when the closure is intact and has not yet been opened, is prevented. Portions 17c of the end 17a of the collar 17 that are adjacent the openings 19 are preferably sharpened for reasons which will become clear from the following part of the description. Moreover, the second collar 17 has an annular rim 17d for cooperating with an opposed lip 21b of the annular element 21.<br><br>
made of plastics material which is preferably not transparent. This portion 13b has, in its inner surface facing the neck 1, a thread 14 which engages the thread 7 associated with the neck 1.<br>
The top wall 11 of the cap 10 has a conventional stopper, generally indicated 15, facing towards the opening 5 of the neck, for closing the opening 5 and hence the bottle in a 1 eaktight manner when the cap is in the c1osure position with the portion 13b of the skirt screwed onto the neck 1. The closure may also include conventional valve means which permit the outlet but not the inlet of liquid, although this is not illustrated.<br>
According to the invention, the closure comprises a first collar 16 provided on the top wall 11 of the cap 10 and extending axially towards the opening 5 of the neck 1 and a second collar 17 fixed radially to the inner surface of the tubular skirt 13 at an axial level substantially facing the free end 4 of the neck 1 and extending towards the top wall 11 of the cap 10.<br>
The second collar 17 is substantially parallel to the inner surface of the tubular skirt 13 and to the first collar 16 and terminates in an end 17a opposite the end<br><br>
16a of the first collar.  Both of the ends are positioned at substantially the same axial level along the axis X~X.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 13, the first collar 16 is spaced radially from the second collar 17 by a radial space 18 and the respective ends 16a and 17a are connected to one another radially, forming openings 19 which extend along arcs of a circle and are distributed aroiind the circular periphery of the closure. The second collar 17 is spaced radially from the inner surface of the tubular skirt 13 of the cap, forming an annular space 20. A first element 21 which, in the embodiment shown, is- of annular shape, is housed in the annular space 20. The first element 21 may alternatively be in the form of at least one circular sector partially occupying the annular space 20. The element 21 has an axial extent less than the axial extent of the annular space 20 which, as can. be seen from the drawings, extends from the top wall 11 of the cap 10 as far as a connection 17b by which the collar 17 is joined to the tubular skirt 13. The function of the annular space 20 and of its axial extent relative to that of the element 21 will become clearer from the following part of the description.<br><br>
Upon the first opening of the closure, which might represent an attempt to tamper with and fraudulently open the bottle, the angular movement imparted to the cap 10 brings about unscrewing of the tubular skirt 13 from the underlying thread 7 associated with the neck of the bottle and consequent axial movement of the skirt. The collars 16 and 17 also move axially, together with the skirt 13, whilst the elements 21 and 22, which are connected to one another by means of the radial bridges 23, remain unharmed by this axial movement. The element 21 becomes housed in the space 2 0 and the openings 19 alternating with the connecting bridges 23 slide on the elements 22 whi-eh are fixed to the neck 1 of the bottle •<br>
When the edges 17c which, in particular but not necessarily are sharpened, come into contact with the radial bridges 23, continuation of the axial movement of the tubular skirt 13 leads to breakage of these bridges and consequent separation of the elements 21 and 22. The element 21 in particular remains housed in the dropping region 20a of the space 20 which it cannot leave because of the axial engagement that has taken place between the lip 21b and the annular rim 17d. As a result, if the cap 10 is subsequently screwed on, the element 21 nevertheless  remains  stationary  in  the position  it<br><br>
adopted immediately after the first opening, engaged on the rim 17d, without returning to its initial position close to the top wall 11.<br>
If, for example, the inscription "OPEN" is associated with the collar 16 on its wall facing radially towards the outside of the closure, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, this inscription is thus made visible as soon as opening has taken place, when the element 21 remains anchored in the region 20a. Naturally, the portion 13a of the tubular skirt 13 must be made of transparent material, at least in the regions radially facing the inscriptions "OPEN".<br>
As shown in Figures 8 and 9, the inscription "CLOSED" may also be added or used as an alternative to the preceding solution on the radial outer wall of the collar 17. This inscription, which is visible when the closure is intact, is obscured by _the element 21 when the closure is opened and the element 21 remains anchored in the region 20a, thus giving an indication that the closure has been opened.<br>
Symbols or particular colours may be used as an alternative to the inscriptions or in combination therewith.<br><br>
Moreover, as shown schematically in Figures 10 and 11, the element 21 may be provided with the inscription "OPEN" reproduced on its radially outward-facing wall. The region of the portion 13a of the tubular skirt of the cap that faces the element 21 when the closure is intact is made of non-transparent material or is obscured, whereas the lower portion is formed so as to be transparent.<br>
After the first opening, the movement of the cap 10 causes the element 21 to be positioned in front of the transparent region of the skirt 13a and thus causes the inscription "OPEN" to appear.<br>
As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the inscription "OPEN" may be formed in the element 21 by perforation and may be made visible by_ a contrasting colouration provided on the underlying wall of the collar 17 when the element 21 is positioned in the space 20 as a result of the first opening of the closure.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing description and illustrations that the elements 21 and 22, together with the openings 19 and the radial bridges 23, form essential<br><br>
parts of the means for causing the appearance of a visible sign meaning "open" on at least a portion of the tubular skirt 13 of the cap according to the embodiment of the invention shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.<br>
In particular, it can be seen that, even in the event of attempted forcing by removing the skirt 13 axially, the closure structure according to the invention nevertheless causes breakage of the bridges 23, owing to their engagement with the sharpened edges 17c of the second collar 17, and movement of the element 21 in the region 20a so that the sign indicating the previously opened condition of the closure is made visible.<br>
With reference to Figures 14 to 18, it will be appreciated that the invention may also be implemented by a different embodiment in which common structural parts are indicated by the same reference numerals as were used with reference to the first embodiment of Figures 1 to 13.<br>
According to this second embodiment, the closure comprises a first collar 24 projecting from the top wall 11 of the cap 10 and facing towards the body of the bottle.   This collar is provided with recesses 25<br><br>
distributed around the circumference and extending along arcs of a circle.<br>
Corresponding elements 26 shaped as arcs of a circle are fitted in the recesses 25 and extend axially, terminating in respective bent lips 26a which engage the annular step 6 of the neck 1 axially.<br>
At the axial end remote from the end having the lip 26a, each element 26 has a cam surface 26b facing radially towards the outside of the cap.<br>
A respective counter-element 27, also in the form of an arc of a circle and having a cam surface 27a complementary with the surface 26b, faces each arc-shaped element 26. Each arc-shaped element 27 preferably but not necessarily-has axial ribs 27b formed on the surface facing radially towards the corresponding element 26. Each element 27 is also connected flexibly at an end 27c, by conventional hinge means 28, to a bracket 29 projecting radially from the inner surface of the skirt 13.<br>
Each arc-shaped element 27 is also provided, on the surface facing radially towards the portion 13a of the<br><br>
skirt 13, with a step 27d, preferably but not necessarily extending over the entire arcuate width of the element 27.<br>
A tubular element 31 made, for example, of a material which changes its colour when subjected to compression is housed in the annular space 3 0 formed between the portion 13a of the tubular skirt 13 and each arc-shaped element 27.<br>
Alternatively, the tubular element 31 may also be constituted merely by arc-shaped portions arranged radially in front of the elements 27.<br>
According to the structure described above, upon the first opening of the cap 10, the axial movement of the tubular skirt 13 also brings about axial movement of the arc-shaped elements 27 and of the tubular element 31 which is pushed by the step 27d until radial movement of the elements 27 towards the portion 13a of the skirt 13 is brought about by the engagement between the opposed cam surfaces 26a and 27a.<br>
This latter radial movement compresses the element 31 and consequently changes its initial coloration.<br><br>
Upon the assumption that the portion 13a of the tubular skirt 13 is transparent and that the initial coloration of the element 31 indicates an intact closure, the colour resulting from the change is adopted as the sign indicating the "OPEN" condition.<br>
Alternatively, the tubular element 31 may be formed in a manner such that, as a result of the compression, the colour change takes place solely in relation to predetermined regions so that the inscription "OPEN" or an equivalent alphabetical sign can appear in relation to these regions.<br>
Still with reference to the second embodiment of the invention, it is pointed out that any attempt to remove the tubular skirt 13 axially in any case brings about radial squashing of the elements 27 and 31, causing the sign indicative of the "OPEN" condition to appear.<br>
Upon the premise that any dimensions and materials may be used, provided -that they are suitable for achieving the purposes indicated, the invention as described above is defined by the appended claims.<br><br>

to  Claim  5,  characterized  in  that  the  means  for<br>
restraining the' at least one first element (21) in the<br><br>
position in which the sign becomes visible comprise a tab (2lb)  projecting radially from the element  (21)  and facing towards the second collar (17) and towards the top wall (11) of the cap, as well as an annular rim (17d) formed on the second collar (17) and facing towards the element  (21),  the tab  (2 lb)  engaging the rim  (17d) axial lay.<br>
7. A closure with an optical tamper indicator according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the visible sign meaning "open" is associated with the peripheral surface of the first collar (16) which can be viewed radially from outside the first portion of the tubular skirt (13) of the cap (10) through a corresponding radially and axially aligned region which is made of transparent material.<br>
8. A closure with optical tamper indicator according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the visible sign meaning "open" -is associated with the peripheral surface of the at least one first element (21) and is made visible, when the element (21) is in its second position, through a corresponding transparent region of the tubular skirt (13) of the cap (10) radially and axially aligned with the said element.<br><br>
9. A closure with an optical tamper indicator according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the means. for bringing about the appearance of a visible sign meaning "open", indicating that the first opening of the closure has taken place, comprise a substance which can change its optical properties and which is included in the at least one first element (31) , a cam surface (26b) formed on the at least one second element (26), the cam surface (26b) facing a complementary cam surface (27a) formed on the free end of the second collar (27) which is rendered radially flexible and is expanded radially towards the inner surface of the tubular skirt (13) of the cap (10) as a result of the relative axial movement of the cam surfaces (26b, 27a) brought about by the unscrewing of the cap (10) upon the first opening of the closure, with the result that the at least one first element (31) is forced to change its optical characteristics which are seen through an aligned transparent region of the tubular skirt (13) of the cap.<br>
10. A closure with an optical tamper indicator according to Claim 9, characterized in that the at least one first element (31) includes a substance which changes its colour when subjected to compression,  the resulting<br><br>
