METHOD FOR MAKING A NANO-PARTICULATE MEDIUM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for malting a nano-particulate medium and to a<br>
method for making a recordable magnetic medium involving the use of such a<br>
method.<br>
State of the Art<br>
The relentless demand for increased capacity on all data storage systems is driving<br>
continual increases in the areal density at which data must be stored on the<br>
recording surface, m magnetic recording the thickness of the storage medium is<br>
limited by the available write field so that any increase in areal density at a given<br>
media thickness must be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the physical<br>
volume available to store 'one bit' of information. At current magnetic recording<br>
densities, a single data bit is encoded as the presence or absence of a transition<br>
from one magnetic domain to the next on a scale where each domain contains very<br>
many particles or grains.<br>
These groups of grains, which form a domain, switch their magnetisation<br>
collectively, creating uncertainty in the final location of the transition. The useful<br>
information is stored in the central part of the bit. At the boundaries of each bit the<br>
poles of the magnetic bits directly oppose one another and these opposing magnets<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
2<br>
tend to destabilise each other and produce ill-defined transition regions. This adds<br>
to the noise. In order to enhance the signal-to-noise level it is desirable to ensure<br>
that the number of grains per bit is much higher than the number of bits at the<br>
boundaries. This requires that each bit occupy an area of currently many hundreds<br>
or thousands of grains. This is shown hi simplified form in Figure 1, hi which the<br>
central region 10 can be seen to consist of a relatively large number of grains<br>
having the same magnetic orientation, this then constituting a single bit.<br>
If the recording density is to be increased, the domain size must become smaller<br>
and therefore the scale of the individual magnetic particles (grains) that comprise<br>
the domain must accordingly be reduced to maintain the number of particles per<br>
domain constant in order not to suffer a degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
Unfortunately recording densities are now such that further decreases in particle<br>
size will soon be blocked by the 'superparamagnetic limit'.  This is the point at<br>
which the thermal energy of the medium's environment becomes comparable with<br>
the anisotropy energy of the magnetic particle. When the volume (V) of a particle<br>
is reduced to the superparamagnetic limit the medium becomes essentially non-<br>
ferromagnetic and loses all ability as a recording medium. Moreover long before<br>
the superparamagnetic limit is actually reached, the probability of spontaneous<br>
magnetisation reversal in very fine grained material becomes significant and the<br>
integrity of recorded data is extremely reduced at typical hard-drive operating<br>
temperatures.   The acceptable minimum lifetime (standard) for recorded data is<br>
currently ten years.   To maintain the long-term integrity of recorded data when<br>
developing media capable of supporting areal densities of around 1 x 1012bits per<br>
square inch (1 Tera bits per square inch - the industry's goal by 2010), it is<br>
necessary to devise procedures for extending the superparamagnetic limit.<br>
Under the constraint imposed by the superparamagnetic limit, a desirable recording<br>
medium is conceived as one consisting of an array of identically sized (mono-<br>
disperse), single-domain particles of a material possessing high intrinsic magnetic<br>
anisotropy and sufficiently dispersed so that any mutual magnetic interaction is<br>
minimised.<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2 004/002118<br>
3<br>
The difficulties of finding commercially viable techniques for the physical<br>
realisation of such a medium are manifold and challenging. The routes in this<br>
direction currently being explored by the recording industry are:<br>
(i)   patterned media produced using lithographic and or etching processes, and<br>
(ii) self-assembling particulate arrays produced via complex chemical or<br>
biological routes.<br>
Both of these are incompatible with current magnetic hard-disk production<br>
techniques. Route (i) is limited in that it cannot within the foreseeable future<br>
produce media structured at the 2.5nm to 12nm required, nor can it produce large<br>
areas of media cost-effectively. Route (ii), although proven to produce, mono-<br>
disperse particles of the size required, struggles to achieve uniformity over any<br>
significantly useful recording area,<br>
A second factor to be taken into account in the development of a magnetic<br>
recording medium is the desirability of producing a so-called "perpendicular"<br>
recording medium. There are two main recording techniques commonly employed<br>
and these are illustrated in Figures 2(a) and 2(b).<br>
In Figure 2(a) a so-called "longitudinal" recording arrangement is shown<br>
comprising a recording medium 20 composed of a number of magnetic domains 22<br>
and a read/write head 24. The domains can be seen to lie horizontally on the<br>
diagram, or "longitudinally" along the major axis of the recording medium and in<br>
addition the inductive write head is a double-pole magnet 26. By contrast, one<br>
form of a known perpendicular recording system comprises for a recording<br>
medium a series of domains which lie vertically (see Figure 2(b)) and face into or<br>
out of a soft magnetic underlayer 28. This perpendicular arrangement also employs<br>
a single-pole write head 30. It is generally accepted that the limit of capacity of a<br>
longitudinal recording system is around 100-200 Gb/in2, whereas the limit with the<br>
perpendicular system is held to be an order of magnitude greater.<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
4<br>
It can therefore be seen that it would be desirable to provide a magnetic recording<br>
medium which contained mono-disperse, single-domain particles having a high<br>
perpendicular anisotropy.<br>

Detailed Description of an Embodiment of the Invention<br>
A method according to the invention for producing a magnetic recording medium<br>
involves the use of apparatus such as that illustrated in Figures 3(a) and 3(b).<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
5<br>
In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), which are front and plan views, respectively, a sputtering<br>
chamber 40 contains at one end, in conventional fashion, a negative electrode 42 in<br>
contact with three targets 44, 46 and 48 composed of platinum, cobalt and silicon<br>
nitride, respectively. At the other end of the chamber, again in known fashion, a<br>
positive electrode 50 is provided, on which a number of substrates 52 are placed.<br>
The substrates are preferably made of a high-temperature glass. The targets and<br>
substrates having been placed inside the chamber, the chamber is evacuated<br>
through a port 54 and an inert gas, which preferably consists of an argon/nitrogen<br>
mixture, is introduced into the chamber through a second port 56. A high voltage is<br>
then fed to the electrodes 42, 50, which sets up a plasma (glow discharge) 60 in the<br>
intervening space. The plasma consists of positive ions of the inert gas. The ions<br>
are accelerated towards the cathode and knock atoms off of the targets, these atoms<br>
then impacting the anode and adhering to the substrates. This is a sputter 'up1<br>
process in that the substrates are above the targets. Such a process is advantageous<br>
when preparing recording media as particles cannot fall off the targets and<br>
contaminate the media being formed.<br>
Both DC and RF voltages are used in the spluttering process. The platinum and<br>
cobalt are DC spluttered but the silicon nitride is RF sputtered as it is an insulator.<br>
Cobalt nitride is produced by 'reactive' sputtering i.e. cobalt nitride is formed<br>
when the cobalt reacts with the nitrogen in the sputtering.<br>
During the sputtering process a heater 58 may assist the deposition process by<br>
heating the substrates and the electrode 50 is made to rotate by some suitable<br>
means. This rotation ensures that all of the substrates are coated equally by the<br>
target atoms.<br>
As each substrate moves round, it picks up atoms from each of the targets in turn,<br>
which will therefore normally form in discrete layers on the substrate. The<br>
thickness of the layers will depend largely on the speed of rotation of the substrate<br>
electrode and the magnitude of the power supplied to the targets, and indeed, if the<br>
rotational speed is high enough (and/or the target power is suitably low), the layers<br>
will be so thin as to amount to one homogenous layer, once sputtering is<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
6<br>
completed. A situation in which discrete layers are formed is shown in Figure 4.<br>
Here the glass substrate 52 can be seen to be coated with a series of tri-layer<br>
coatings 53 composed of platinum (Pt), cobalt nitride (C02N) and silicon nitride<br>
(S13N4). (The order of these constituent parts is arbitrary.) The number of such<br>
composite layers is determined by the number of passes of the substrate past each<br>
of the targets. In the preferred realisation of the present method the total thickness<br>
of each composite layer is between approximately 3nm and 5nm. Although the<br>
three constituent layers form ing each composite layers are shown to be of identical<br>
thickness, in practice they may well be of different thicknesses. This is discussed in<br>
more detail later.<br>
Once the desired number of coatings has been sputtered on and to the desired<br>
depth, both the platinum and the cobalt targets are switched off (i.e. the negative<br>
high-voltage feed to them is interrupted), leaving only the silicon nitride target still<br>
energised. This then continues to apply a sputtered layer of silicon nitride to the<br>
topmost layer of the substrates, this new layer constituting an outermost rugged<br>
protective layer 62, which is particularly useful where the structure thus created is<br>
to be employed as a recording medium in conjunction with a read/write head.<br>
A preferred thickness of the protective layer 62 is between approximately 5nm and<br>
10nm.<br>
The sputtering process completed, the substrates are removed from the chamber 40<br>
and inserted into a heating chamber (not shown), where they are subjected to a<br>
 rapid thermal processing (RTP) phase, in which they are very rapidly heated in a<br>
vacuum by an optical heating process to a temperature of between 500 and 650°C<br>
which is maintained for an interval of between 30 and 60 seconds, after which the<br>
optical heat source is removed and the sample allowed to cool naturally in vacuum,<br>
 The cobalt nitride is unstable and the actual target temperature is chosen such that<br>
the cobalt nitride disassociates, releasing nitrogen that escapes by diffusion and is<br>
pumped away. The freed cobalt is left in a dispersed, very active quasi-vapour state<br>
and readily alloys with the similarly dispersed platinum which, like the silicon<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
7<br>
nitride, is unaffected at the elevated temperatures employed. This process occurs<br>
whether sputtering has produced discrete layers originally or one large<br>
homogeneous layer, as mentioned as a possibility above.<br>
The composition of this material - i.e. the relative thicknesses of the three<br>
constituent layers - is chosen so that, on cooling, the density of the PtCo alloy<br>
forming throughout the resulting silicon nitride matrix is insufficient for its<br>
formation as a single layer, but is "condensed" into a dispersion of substantially<br>
identically sized particles having volumes almost optimally spaced between the<br>
single-domain and superparamagnetic limits. More precisely, the particles should<br>
at their largest extreme be small enough to be in the single-domain state, where<br>
their only magnetisation-reversal process is by coherent rotation against the<br>
anisotropy field. If they are larger than this, reversal becomes easier as domain<br>
growth processes become possible. At the lower extreme of particle size, the<br>
volume of each particle should be such that its total magnetic energy is<br>
considerably larger than the thermal energy of its surroundings, otherwise it will<br>
become superparamagnetic instead of ferromagnetic and incapable of storing<br>
information.<br>
It should be noted that, because of the presence of the SiN/SisN-t, the particles do<br>
not form a single layer (a "mono-layer") on the substrate, but are separated into a<br>
plurality of layers, so that a magnetic bit is still formed by a number of particles, as<br>
is currently the case in the prior art. This has the advantage of giving a larger<br>
readout signal and hence, as with the known methods, a larger S/N ratio.<br>
The relative thicknesses of the Pt, C0N/C02N and SiN/Si^ layers can, then, be<br>
readily established by experiment and are produced by applying different DC<br>
voltages to the three targets 44, 46, 48 in the chamber 40 (see Figures 3(a) and<br>
3(b)).<br>
In a preferred realisation of the invention, the temperature attained during the RTP<br>
phase is such as not only to ensure disassociation of the C0N/C02N, but to ensure<br>
that the PtCo alloy formed is in its crystalline form. This is desirable, since the<br><br>
1<br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
8<br>
anisotropy of the alloy produced in this particular crystalline form is higher than<br>
with other crystalline forms. The temperature at which crystallisation in this form<br>
takes place is higher than that at which the C0N/C02N disassociates, hence the<br>
actual temperature to which the substrate is taken during the RTP phase is the<br>
higher of the two temperatures.<br>
The RTP temperatures cited above are those at which the necessary disassociation<br>
of the nitride of the magnetic element and, preferably also, the desirable crystalline<br>
form of the resulting alloy take place. These temperatures in any evaluation of the<br>
inventive process may or may not relate to the actual temperature of the substrate<br>
in question. In testing the present method, for instance, the inventors measured not<br>
the temperature being reached by the substrate in question, but that of a similar, but<br>
unprocessed, substrate placed alongside the substrate in question. Thus it is<br>
possible that the actual substrate temperature(s) at which the desired effect(s) are<br>
observed are different from the temperatures being measured. This, however, is<br>
immaterial, as long as the measured temperatures are accurately correlated with the<br>
occurrence of these desired effects. A similar consideration applies'in respect of<br>
the use of different compositions. Samples which are made with deliberately<br>
different compositions (e.g. in which the ratio of the amount of C0N/C02N to the<br>
amount of Pt is different) will have different optical absorptions. They will<br>
therefore take up energy during the optically driven thermal-processing phase with<br>
different efficiencies. Consequently, two different samples processed at the same<br>
measured temperatures will reach different true temperatures and care must be<br>
taken to ensure that each sample, whatever its composition, is raised to a<br>
temperature sufficient for the required disassociation, and preferably also the<br>
required crystallisation, to occur.<br>
A very considerable degree of control over the properties of the recording medium<br>
and the resultant recording characteristics is afforded by the precise manipulation<br>
 of the deposition parameters (including target voltage, substrate rotation rate, etc)<br>
during sputtering and the time-temperature profiles employed during the RTP<br>
phase.<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
9<br>
The RTP temperature determines not only whether disassociation and correct<br>
crystallisation takes.place but also whether the final product has a higher or lower<br>
coercivity. The initial pt, C02N and SisN ratios determine the final characteristics<br>
of the resulting medium.<br>
Although in the process described above the sputtering and RTP phases have been<br>
assumed to take place in two distinct locations, they may be carried out in a single<br>
piece of apparatus. This may take the form of a conventional sputtering chamber<br>
which has been modified by the inclusion of an appropriate heating means for<br>
heating the substrates up to the required temperature range.<br>
In addition, whereas the described process has created particles made of PtCo, the<br>
present invention also envisages the use of iron nitride (FeN) in place of cobalt<br>
nitride, which would then result in the creation of PtFe particles instead of PtCo,<br>
though it would be necessary to take into account a possible difference in target<br>
temperature at which the FeN would disassociate compared with the C0N/C02N.<br>
Another substitution that could be made is that of diamond-like carbon for the<br>
silicon nitride of the final protective layer. Diamond-like carbon is the industry's<br>
favourite interfacial layer for recording heads due to its extreme durability and<br>
ruggedness and may therefore have advantages over the use of SiN/Si3N4 for this<br>
function. It may well, however, have to be applied to the treated substrate in a<br>
separate chamber (this is in contrast to the SiN/Si3N4 protective layer, which is<br>
applied in the same chamber as the C0N/C02N4 and Pt), and this would<br>
considerably complicate the production cycle.<br>
Typical changes needed in order to create a medium with much better<br>
characteristics include the substrate and protective overlayer being optimised to<br>
low flying recording heads and the thickness of medium optimised to maximise<br>
read out signal and a soft appropriate underlayer added to the production process.<br>
The production routine described above uses plant and processes already in<br>
common use in the hard-disk recording industry and delivers a near mono-disperse<br>
medium uniformly across large areas.   The medium has a high perpendicular<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
10<br>
anisotropy and lias been produced during tests with high remanence and<br>
coercivities in the range 2.5kOe to &gt;16kOe. In initial recording experiments,<br>
media having coercivities at the lower end of this range have already been<br>
demonstrated to support perpendicular recording at densities approaching that<br>
achieved by the most advanced current conventional media.<br>
This is demonstrated by comparing Figure 5(a) with Figure 5(b). These recording<br>
experiments were conducted using the stray field of longitudinal recording heads<br>
not optimised perpendicular heads.    Figures 5 illustrate the performance of a<br>
recording medium made in accordance with the present invention, but employing<br>
the relatively low RTP target temperature of 500°C and having as a consequence a<br>
relatively low coercivity allowing the ready writing of data to the medium, even<br>
without the use of a soft magnetic underlayer often employed with perpendicular<br>
recording systems (cf. Figure 2(b)). It is worth noting that the substrate used in this<br>
test was not specially prepared in any way, e.g. by special cleaning and smoothing.<br>
It is also worth noting that the substrate used in this test was prepared with no<br>
Si3N4 separator layers only an overcoat.    The different traces correspond to<br>
different data rates ranging from 3.2kfci (3200 flux changes per inch) to 128kfci.<br>
The latter corresponds' to a data density of approximately 300 Mb/sq. inch. Figures<br>
5, on the other hand, shows the performance of a known continuous thin-film<br>
multi-layer medium made using known techniques and with readings taken using a<br>
perpendicular recording system with soft magnetic underlayer to aid writability.<br>
The substrate used here had been specially cleaned and smoothed, which has the<br>
effect of enhancing the performance.<br>
As can be seen, the performances of the two systems are very comparable. The<br>
main difference, however, is that, although the known system is working at the<br>
upper limit of its capacity, the purely experimental system illustrated is at the lower<br>
end of its capability. Greater performance can be enjoyed by raising the sputtered<br>
substrate to a higher temperature during the RTP phase, so as to give rise to smaller<br>
particles of higher coercivity and anisotropy, which will enable much greater<br>
quantities of data to be written to the medium - up to 1 Tb per square inch and<br><br>
WO 2004/105007	PCT/GB2004/002118<br>
11<br>
beyond. la that case, however, it will be necessary to employ local optical heating<br>
of the medium in order to be able to perform the writing operation.<br>
Referring now to Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b), the material compared in the writing<br>
experiments with the IBM material consists only of Cobalt nitride and Platinum<br>
with a 10 nm over-layer of silicon nitride. There is no silicon nitride filling or<br>
separator. The sample before RTP consisted of 72 'layers' of cobalt nitride and<br>
Platinum each layer being 0.09Inm thick respectively. Note these are not layers in<br>
accepted sense since they are sub-atomic thickness. Figure 6 (a) shows the RTP<br>
heating profile of temperature as a function of time. It is seen that the sample is<br>
kept at the plateau 'temperature' for 60 seconds. Figure 6(b) shows the saturated<br>
magnetic hysteresis loop of this material in the perpendicular direction as obtained<br>
using Polar Kerr effect.<br>
As a second example of how we can vary characteristics consider a film deposited<br>
in the same 4 minute time period as the above but now with silicon nitride<br>
sputtered at the same time. The sample is composed of 108 'layers' of Cobalt<br>
nitride, Platinum and Silicon nitride. The layer thickness are 0.091nm, 0.078nm<br>
and 0.014nm respectively. Again the sample is over-coated by lOnm silicon<br>
nitride. This sample is processed at a plateau temperature using the RTP profile of<br>
Figure 7(a).<br>
This produces the magnetic hysteresis loop in the perpendicular direction shown in<br>
Figure 7(b) now obtained using the Faraday effect in an attempt to increase the<br>
field available in the instrumentation. It is seen that this is a minor loop that is not<br>
saturated in the field available. We are still endeavouring to produce a saturated<br>
loop of this material which we expect to be square with a coercivity of around<br>
20kOe. This material should support a very high recording density with good<br>
stability.<br>
Figure 8 is an example of a Faraday loop of the same material as in previous graph<br>
but subjected to RTP at 500°C instead of 650°C. As can be seen the loop is much<br><br>

squarer saturates at approximately 20kOe and has a coercivity of approximately<br>
10kOe.<br>
While the present manufacturing process is mainly directed to the production of a<br>
recording medium, it may also he put to use in other applications. One such is a<br>
catalytic process involving alloys such as PtCo. The advantage of the present<br>
method of manufacturing the mono-disperse, uniform distribution of PtCo particles<br>
in a matrix is that, since the particles themselves are so small and substantially<br>
spherical, the area-to-volume ratio of the particles is high, which can result in a<br>
superior catalysis performance, since there is then relatively more surface area of<br>
the PtCo particles available to perform the catalytic process. When used in a<br>
catalytic application, the nano-particulate medium made in accordance with the<br>
present invention will normally not require the protective layer described earlier.<br>
In summary, when Pt is added CoPt alloy particles are formed and may be<br>
developed to exhibit the full anisotropy of that alloy expressed perpendicularly.<br>
The techniques described herein relate to HARM (Heat Assisted Recordable<br>
Magnetic) media and can result in forming perpendicular HARM media with the<br>
potential to store in excess of lTb/sq. in.<br>
Whilst the magnetic element is preferably cobalt, in principle sputter from a cobalt<br>
nitride target could also be used.<br><br>
