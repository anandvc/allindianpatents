"A METHOD OF SYNTHESIZING OF CHLORINATED PYRIMIDINES"<br>
SYNGENTA   LIMITED,   of  Fernhurst,   Haslemere,   Surrey   GU27   3JE, England,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of synthesizing of chlorinated pyrimidines.<br>
This invention relates to the field" of organic compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to the synthesis of certain chlorinated pyrimidines such as 4,6-mchloropyriimdie. In general, synthesis of cmorihatedpyrhniduies according to the present invention is accomplished by reacting imidoyl chlorides with phosgene.<br>
Description of Related Art.<br>
Chlorinated pyrimidines prepared by the process of the present invention and, in particular 4,6-dichloropyrimidine, are known as useful compounds in the synthesis of many biologically active compounds.  Use of such chlorinated pyrimidines in production of such varied compositions as pesticides and pharmaceuticals makes them economically important compounds as well. For example, 4,6-dichloropvrimidine can. be us&amp;d in the: manufacture of azoxystrobin, a methoxyacrylate-type fimgicide. Because of their wideiuse and economic importance, many methods of synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines, especially 4,6-dicMoropyiimidine, have been developed.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,018,045 to Whitton et al. discloses a process for preparing 4,6-chloropyrimidine that comprises treating 4,6-hydioxyprimidine with phosphorous oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride) in the presence of a saturated hindered amine, the hydrochloride salt of a saturated hindered amine, or an unsaturated 5-metribered nitrogen containing ring, or a mixture thereof. As a farther step, the 4,6-dichloro-pyrimidine formed from these reactions is first directly extracted by, for example, a counter-current liquid-liquid separation technique. The process may also include mixing the residue that remains after the direct extraction with an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide in order to liberate the saturated hindered amine or unsaturated 5-member nitrogen-containing ring (or mixture thereof), that was used in the process.<br>
Other disclosures generally relating to preparation of 4,6-dicMoropyiimidine by reacting 4,6-d^ydxoxypiimidiue with phosphorous oxychloride in the presence of a<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/02614<br><br>
suitable base include Kenner et al. (J. CHEM. SOC, Nov. 1943, pp. 574-574), Hull (J. CHEM. SOC., Aug. 1951, p. 2214), British Patent GB2287466, and U.S. Patent No. 5,583,226 to Stucky et al In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,677,453 to Cramm et al. discloses synthesis of 4,6-dichloropyrinridines by reacting 4,6-ydroxypyrimidines with excess phosphoryl chloride. In this type of synthesis, no base is added; however, an excess of phosphorus and chloride is used (with respect to the 4,6-dmydroxypyrimidines). This excess is maintained by adding phosphorus trichloride and chlorine to the reaction mixture in amounts such that the phosphorus trichloride is maintained in excess over the chlorine. The process is carried out at temperatures of 60-110°C. Distillation is advantageously used to purify the 4,6-dicWoropyrimidineg,<br>
Further, U.S. Patent No. 5&gt;3Q694 to Jones et al. and WO 95/29166 (Zeneca Limited) disclose that 4,6-dichloropyrimidine can be prepared by reacting 4,6-dmydroxypyrimidine with phosgene (carbonyl chloride; carbon oxychloride; COCI2) in the presence of a suitable base. The base is preferably a tertiary amine and the base-to-. phosgene rati© is preferably in the range of 10:1 to 1:10: Preferably, the process is carried , out in a solvent or a mixture of solvents, with chlorinated solvents, ethers, and polar aprotic solvents being'most preferred.<br>
Yanagida et al (J. ORG. CHEM. 34(10):2972-2975,1969) disclose preparation of specific 2,5-disubstitated-4,6-dichloropyrimidines by reacting an aliphatic nitrile compound of the general formula RCH2CN with itself in the presence of HC1 and COCl2. According to the synthesis of Yanagida et al., R can be H, CH3, CH3CH2, CH3(CH2)2, CH2(CH2)3, (CH3)2CH, CI, C1(CH2)2, or CH3CH20(CH2)2. The authors propose a reaction scheme in which 2,5-disubstitated-4,6-dicMoropyrimidine synthesis proceeds through a 6-cMoro-2,5-disubstitated-4(3H)pyriinidone intermediate. Further reaction of these intermediates with phosgene gives the corresponding 2,5-disubstituted-4,6-dichloropyrimidines. The authors also propose a second reaction scheme for formation of 2,5-disubstimted-4,6-dichloropyrimidines from aliphatic nitriles. In the second scheme an aliphatic nitrile condenses with itself in the presence of HC1 to form an amidine, which is then converted in the presence of phosgene to ultimately give a 2,5-disubstituted-4,6-dichloropyrimidine. Further, Yanagida et al (J. BULL. CHEM. SOC. JAPAN 46:299-302,<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT7GB01/02614<br><br>
1973) discloses reaction of N-(a-chloroalkenyl)alkylamidine hydrochlorides with phosgene to create 4,6-dichloro-2,5-disubstituted pyrimidines.<br>
However, none of these references disclose the preparation of chlorinated pyrimidines that are not substituted in the 2 position, including 4,6-dicchloropyrimidine itself. Synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines that are not substituted in the 2-position requires cross-condensation of two distinct imidoyl chloride compounds, with one of the imidoyl chloride components being derived from either hydrogen cyanide or formamide.<br>
Because of the economic importance of 4,6-dichloropyrimidine in the production of agricultural and medical compounds, as well as its importance in production of tools for scientific research, new, straightforward, rapid, and cost-effective methods for synthesis of this chlorinated pyrimidine are continually being developed.<br>
Summary of the.Ihvention.<br>
The present invention provides a method of synthesizing 4,6-dichloropyrimidine, 4-chloro-6-hydr6xypyrimidine, 5-substiml^^chloro-6-hydoxypyrimidines, and 5-substitxited^,'6-dichloropyrimidines: The method is less expensive and simpler than those methods currently available. In general; the method of preparing these compounds according to the present invention comprises cross-condensation of formamidoyl chloride with a distinct imidoyl chloride compound in die presence of phosgene (COCI2) and HCI and, optionally, in the presence of solvent. For present purposes, "distinct imidoyl chloride compound" refers to compounds with different hydrocarbyl groups, preferably different alkyl groups, than formamidoyl chloride, for example, acetamidoyl chloride. The present invention also includes use of compounds which can be easily converted into imidoyl chlorides under reaction conditions, for example, nitriles like acetonitrile which react with HC1 to give the imidoyl chloride. In the case of formamidoyl chloride, the starting materials can optionally be HCN and HC1; or formamide and COCI2.<br>
In one embodiment, the synthesis method of the present invention includes cross-condensation of imidoyl chloride compounds derived from a nitrile and hydrogen cyanide. For example, the method of the invention can include reacting acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide with hydrogen chloride and phosgene to form 4,6-dichloropyrimidine.<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/026U<br><br>
Ln other embodiments of the invention, the method includes cross-condensation of imidoyl chloride compounds derived from an alkylamide and hydrogen cyanide. For example, the method of the invention can include reacting acetamide and hydrogen cyanide with hydrogen chloride and phosgene to form 4,6-dichloropyrimidine.<br>
In further embodiments of the invention, the method includes cross-condensation of imidoyl chloride compounds derived from a nitrile and formamide. For example, the method of the invention can include reacting acetonitrile and formamide with hydrogen chloride and phosgene to form 4,6-dichloropyrirnidine.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the method includes cross-condensation of imidoyl chloride compounds derived from an alkylamide and formamide. For example, the method of the invention can include reacting acetamide and formamide with hydrogen chloride and phosgene to form 4,6-dichlor pyrimidine.<br>
The solvent can optionally be an inert organic solvent, for example chlorobenzene, or an excess of one of the raw materials, for example acetonitrile.<br>
Reaction temperatures can be th the range of 0°C to 160°C, preferably 60°C to 120°C, and most preferably 100?C to 110°C.<br>
The reaction is typically carried out itf a sealed-vessel under autogenous pressure of 0 to 800 psig, preferably 100 to 300 psig, and inost'preferably 150 to 250 psig.<br>
The process of the invention results in preferential formation of the desired chlorinated pyrimidine (i.e., the cross condensation product) relative to formation of the chlorinated pyrimidine substituted at the 2 position (i.e., the self condensation product). Li particular, it is surprising to observe that reaction of formamidoyl chloride or its equivalents with acetamidoyl chloride or its equivalents favors the production of 4,6-dichloropyrirnidine, the cross-coupling product, over the production of 2-methyl-4,6-mchloropyrimidine, the self condensation product from acetonitrile. For example, an equimolar mixture of the two (formamidoyl chloride or equivalent with acetamidoyl chloride or equivalent) is expected to give the statistical 1:1 distribution of 4,6-dichloropyrirnidine and 2-methyl-4,6-dichloropyrimidine. In contrast a distribution of approximately 10:1 is typically observed favoring 4,6^ichloropyrimidine itself. Similarly, when a large excess of acetonitrile relative to formamidoyl chloride is used, the product ratio indicates that the cross-condensation product is preferentially formed. For example,<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT7GB01/02614<br><br>
when a 37:1 molar ratio of acetonitrile to formamidoyl chloride is used, the ratio of 4,6-dichloropyrimidine to 2-memy-4-6-dichloropyrimidine is approximately 1:1.4. In a statistical distribution of products, a ratio of 1:37 would be expected.<br>
All of the embodiments described above can also be used for the preparation of 4-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidine by limiting the amount of phosgene or by conducting the reaction at low temperatures.<br>
All of the embodiments described above can also be used for the preparation of certain 5-substimted-4,6-dichloropyrimidines by using appropriately substituted amides or nitriles. For example, the method of the invention can include reacting butyronitrile and formamide with hydrogen chloride and phosgene to form 5-ethyl-4-,6-d!ichloropyiimidine. All of the embodiments described above can also be used for the preparation of 5-substitated-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidine by using appropriately substituted amides or nitriles and by limiting the amount of phosgene or by conducting the reaction at low temperatures.<br>
The chlorinated pyrimidines produced by the method of the invention can be used to synthesize .commercially or medically important compounds. For example, the chlorinated pyrimidines, especially 4,6-dichlorppyrimidine, dan.be used to make pesticides, and/or pharmaceuticals, such as nucleoside analogs and compounds that are active on the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, and humans.<br>
Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. While the following detailed description relates to preferred embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited in scope to the specific details provided below, but encompasses the entire scope disclosed and claimed herein, including all obvious variations that can be made by those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention relates to methods of synthesizing 4,6-dichloropyrimidine, 4-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidine, 5-substitated-4,6-dichlorpyrirnidines, and 5-substituted-4-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidines from imidoyl chloride compounds. The present invention contemplates use of starting materials that can be converted to imidoyl chlorides in situ under reaction conditions. Such starting materials include mixtures of nitriles and HC1, as well as mixtures of amides and phosgene. Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of 4,6-!' dichloropyrimidine, 4-chioro-6-hydroxypyrimidine, 5-substituted-4-6-diehlorpyrimidines,: and 5-substimted-4-chloro^-hydroxypyrimidines. The methods of synthesizing these compounds comprise reacting phosgene (COCI2) with imidoyl chloride compounds of the formula:<br><br>
in which R1 can be, independently, hydrogen or a C1 - C12 hydrocarbyl group, and at least one of the imidoyl chlorides must have two alpha hydrogens. In the case where a 5-substimted-4-,6-dicMorpyrimidine or a 5-substimted-4-chloro-6-hydVoxypyrimidine is formed, the 5 substituent is the same moiety as the R1 moiety of the above imidoyl chloride. The term C1 - C12 " hydrocarbyl group" refers to hydrocarbyl groups such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, aryl, and the like wherein said hydrocarbyl group is optionally substituted with 1-5 (preferably 1 or 2) substituents. The substituents of the aliphatic moieties can be halo, aryl, alkoxy or the tike, and the substituents of the<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/02614<br><br>
aromatic moieties can be halo, alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkynyl, or the like. Preferred are C1 - C6 hydrocarbyl groups such as phenyl and lower alkyl, and more preferred are C1 -C3 hydrocarbyl groups, particularly alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl. The imidoyl chlorides can be prepared in situ by the reaction of a nitrile with HC1, or by the reaction of an amide with phosgene.<br>
In the method of synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines according to the present invention, two distinct imidoyl chloride compounds are reacted with phosgene to synthesize the desired chlorinated pyrimidine. One or both of the imidoyl chloride compounds can be supplied pre-formed to the method of synthesizing chlorinated pyrimidines according to the invention. Alternatively, both of the imidoyl chloride compounds can be synthesized as part of the method of synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines according to the invention. For example, one or both of the imidoyl chloride compounds can be synthesized from organic amides or from organic nitriles. In one embodiment of the present invention, one imidoyl chloride compound is synthesized from an organic amide while the other imidoyl chloride is synthesized from an organic nitrile. A general reaction scheme that includes the optional formationof imidoyl chloride intermediates from both organic amides (e.g./ formamide and acetamide) and organic nitriles (e.g., hydrogen cyanide and aeetonitrile) is presented in Figure 2: As depicted in Figure 2, cross-condensation of two different imidoyl chloride compounds can produce an intermediate that can react with phosgene to produce a cWorohydroxypyrimidine. The cMorohydroxypyrimidine so produced can then react with phosgene to produce 4,6-mcMoropyrimidines. If R1 (see Figure 2) is a hydrogen atom, the method of the invention produces 4,6-dichloropyrimidine itself. If R1 is other than hydrogen, the method of the invention produces 5-substituted-4,6-dichloropyrimidines. For example, if R is CH2CH3, the method of the invention produces 5-emyl-4,6-dicWoropyrimidine.  The formation of chlorinated pyrimidines by cross-condensation of two different imidoyl chloride compounds according to the methods disclosed herein were unknown at the time of the present invention.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, the method of synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines includes synthesis of two distinct imidoyl chloride compounds by reacting two distinct organic amides with COCI2, followed by cross-condensation of the two<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/02614<br><br>
imidoyl chloride compounds in the presence of phosgene to form the desired chlorinated pyrimidine. Organic amides are generally represented by the formula R-CONH2. R can be hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group, but is preferably hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl group, and one of the imidbyl chlorides has at least two alpha hydrogens. The general reaction for this embodiment of the invention is depicted schematically in Figure 2 in which R1 is chosen from among the R1 groups disclosed above. In a preferred embodiment, the organic amides are unsubstituted alkylamides.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, a first organic amide is first reacted with phosgene. In certain embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the reaction is allowed to proceed only briefly before additional reactants are added to the reaction mixture. In these certain embodiments, little or no detectable product is produced before additional reactants are added. In other embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the reaction is allowed to proceed until a substantial detectable amount of intermediate product is formed before additional reactants are added.<br>
Once the first organic amide has-reacted with phosgene to the extent desired, a second organic amide, which is a different organic amide than the first organic amide, is added to the reaction mixture. The reactants are permitted to react for a sufficient time to produce 4-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidines and 4,6-dichloropyrimidines if sufficient phosgene is present. In certain embodiments, the reaction is allowed to proceed until a substantial detectable amount of -4-,6-dichloropyrimidine is formed before the reaction is terminated.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a first organic amide is reacted with phosgene to completion (Le., to the point where all, or essentially all, of one or more of the reactants is used up) in a first reaction vessel. Similarly, a second organic amide, which may be different than the first organic amide, is reacted with phosgene to completion in a second reaction vessel. Upon completion of the respective reactions, the two reaction mixtures are combined to form a third reaction mixture. The reacting compounds in the third reaction mixture are permitted to react for a sufficient time to produce 4-chloro-6-hydroxypyrimidines and 4,6-dichloropyrimidines if sufficient phosgene is used. In certain embodiments, the reaction is allowed to proceed until a<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/02614<br><br>
substantial detectable amount of -4,-6-cnloropyrimidine is formed before the reaction is terminated.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a first and a second organic amide are combined to form a first mixture containing reactants. Phosgene is added to the first mixture to form a second mixture, and the mixture is reacted until 4-chloro-6-hydVoxypyrimidine or 4,6-dichloropyrimidine (if enough phosgene is used) is synthesized.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the two organic amides are formamide and acetamide. Formamide and acetamide are reacted, separately or together, with phosgene to form imidoyl chloride compounds, which are then converted to 4,6-dichloropyrimidine by reaction with phosgene. A general reaction scheme that accounts for the formation of 4,6-Uchloropyrirnidine from formamide and acetamide (R1 = H) is presented in Figure 2. In this reaction mechanism, formamide and acetamide are reacted, either partially or wholly, with phosgene to produce imidoyl chloride intermediates. These imidoyl chloride intermediates condense to form an intermediate that can react with phosgene to form chlorohydroxypyrimidine. Chlorohydroxy-pyrimidine then reacts.with phosgene to produce 4,6-d4chloropyrimidine, carbon dioxide (C02)/and hydrogen chloride (HC1).<br>
In asecond aspect of the invention, the method of- synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines includes reacting two distinct organic nitrile compounds of formula R-CN with hydrogen chloride to form two distinct imidoyl chloride compounds, which are then converted to the desired chlorinated pyrimidines by cross-condensation in the presence of phosgene. R can be a hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group, but is preferably hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl group, preferably with less than 8 carbons, provided that one of the nitrile compounds must have 2 alpha hydrogens, for example, butyronitrile. The general reaction for this embodiment of the invention is depicted schematically in Figure 2 in which R1 is chosen from among the R1 groups disclosed above. In preferred embodiments, the organic nitriles are unsubstituted alkyl nitriles.<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, the method of synthesis of chlorinated pyrirnidines includes reacting a distinct organic nitrile compound of formula R-CN with hydrogen chloride to form a distinct imidoyl chloride compound, which is cross-<br><br>
WO 02/04428<br><br>
PCT/GB01/02614<br><br>
condensed with formamidoyl chloride (produced by the reaction of formamide and phosgene) in the presence of phosgene to produce the desired chlorinated pyrimidines. R can be a hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group, but is preferably hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl group, preferably with less than 8 carbons, provided that the nitrile compound has 2 alpha hydrogens, for example, butyronitrile. Li preferred embodiments, the organic nitrile is an unsubstituted alkyl nitrile.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, the method of synthesis of chlorinated pyrimidines includes reacting a distinct organic amide compound of formula R-CONHfe with phosgene to form a distinct imidoyl chloride compound, which is cross-condensed with formamidoyl chloride (produced by the reaction of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide) in the presence of phosgene to produce the desired chlorinated pyrimidines. R can be a hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group, but is preferably hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl group, preferably with less than 8 carbons, provided that the amide compound has 2 alpha hydrogens, for example, butyramide. In ^preferred embodiments, the organic amide is an unsubstituted alkyl amide.<br>
The following examples are to illustrate the invention,, but should not be • interpreted; as a limitation thereon. EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: General procedure for synthesis of 4,6-dichloropyrimidine from amides and nitriles<br>
A Hastelloy C accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) sphere is charged with reactants and attached to the ARC. The mixture is heated under autogenous pressure. A pressure transducer is used to monitor the pressure in the ARC sphere during the course of synthesis. After the desired reaction time, the ARC sphere is allowed to cool to room temperature (approximately 20°C - 25 °C). The residual pressure on the sphere is then vented through a caustic scrubber.
