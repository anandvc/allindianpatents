				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process for hydrotreating a diesel fuel feedstock, to a<br>
hydrotreating unit for the implementation of the said process, and to a corresponding<br>
hydrorefining unit.<br>
Due to the increasing strictness of pollution control standards for diesel engines,<br>
the specifications for diesel engine fuels have changed during the last two decades and<br>
new constraints have appeared which have resulted in a modification of the formulations<br>
of diesel engine fuel mixtures.<br>
Since January 2005, the specifications for diesel engine fuels have been as follows:<br>
(European Standard EN590):<br>
Density (at 15°C): 820-845 kg/m3<br>
T95% (Distillation temperature for 95% of the diesel fuel): 360°C (maximum)<br>
Sulphur content: 50 mg/kg (maximum)<br>
Engine cetane number: 51 (minimum)<br>
Calculated cetane index (ASTM D4737): 46 (minimum)<br>
Cloud point: 

The desired bases are thus light sulphur-free bases with a high cetane index which<br>
distil completely before 360°C.<br>
The objectives are to further reduce the sulphur content to a value of less than<br>
10 mg/kg by 2009 and to increase the minimum value of the engine cetane number.<br>
One solution for improving the cetane index consists in adding a cetane number<br>
improver. These are generally alkyl nitrates, which intervene in the basic oxidation stages<br>
before the self-ignition of the mixture. They thus reduce the ignition delay and make it<br>
possible to increase the cetane index by 3 to 5 points, depending on the amount added.<br>
However, they decrease in effectiveness as the starting cetane index decreases.<br>
Another solution consists in adding a substitute fuel to the mixture, such as a<br>
biofuel, as esters of vegetable oils generally exhibit a good cetane index.<br>
For this reason, European Directive 2003/30/EC is targeted in particular at<br>
promoting the use of biofuels. In transportation, the European Community has adopted an<br><br>
objective of a portion of biofuels of 5.75% of the NCV (Net Calorific Value) of fuels in<br>
2010, that is to say that the amount of biofuel present in the mixture should provide 5.75%<br>
of the NCV of the mixture.<br>
Currently, the French Government has introduced a tax: the TGAP (Taxe Generate<br>
des Activites Polluantes) [General Tax on Polluting Activities], which relates to fuels<br>
consumed on French territory. The fuels subject to this tax are "SP95". "SP98" and "Diesel<br>
Engine Fuel". The objective of this tax is to encourage the incorporation of biofuel by<br>
gradually increasing the percentage of the NCV (Net Calorific Value) contributed by the<br>
proportion of biofuel from 1.75% in 2006 to 7.00% in 2010.<br>
This addition is carried out on the basis of the energy and the "bio" origin of the<br>
products incorporated. Thus, the level of ETBE (ethyl tert-butyl ether) is reduced since it<br>
comprises only 47% of ethanol (of agricultural origin) and a lower NCV than petrol.<br>
For diesel engine fuels, the most commonly used biofuels are vegetable oil esters,<br>
such as rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME).<br>
These diesel engine fuels are generally obtained by mixing the biofuel with the<br>
diesel engine fuel after treatment of the latter. These mixtures are thus often produced by<br>
the distributors, immediately before distributing the fuel.<br>
The mixtures obtained from vegetable oil methyl esters exhibit the advantage of a<br>
cetane number in accordance with the standard but their density (greater than 880 kg/mJ) is<br>
much greater than the specification of the standard, which causes formulation difficulties<br>
at high levels of incorporation. Vegetable oil ether esters also result in excessively heavy<br>
mixtures, without forgetting the problem of stability over time.<br>
Processes for refining the biomass which have been developed for producing these<br>
biofuels are already known. Thus, the documents US 4 992 605, US 5 705 722,<br>
EP 1 396 531 and SE 520 633 describe processes for hydrotreating triglycerides present in<br>
vegetable oils. However, the reactions employed are highly exothermic. In order to limit<br>
the problems related to this high exothermicity, it is necessary to recirculate up to 80% of<br>
the feedstock at the outlet of the hydrotreating reactor to the inlet of the latter, hence the<br>
need to produce a new plant dedicated to this hydrotreating process and to hydraulically<br>
oversize this unit with respect to the amount of the feedstock actually treated.<br>
Furthermore, Patent Application EP 1 693 432 describes a process for<br>
hydrotreating a mixture of a feedstock of petroleum origin and of a feedstock of biological<br><br>
origin. Nevertheless, as the reactions for the hydrodeoxygenating of the triglycerides are<br>
faster than those for the hydrorefining of the petroleum fractions, the treatment of such a<br>
mixture of feedstocks of petroleum and biological origin at the top of the reactor results in<br>
a fall in the hydrogen partial pressure and thus a fall in the catalytic activity in<br>
hydrotreating the petroleum feedstock. Furthermore, parallel reactions during the<br>
hydrorefining of the triglycerides result in the production of gases, such as carbon dioxide<br>
CO2, methane CH4 and carbon monoxide CO. which is regarded as a reversible inhibitor<br>
of the desulphurizing activity of the catalyst. In point of fact, in a conventional<br>
hydrotreating unit, these gases, which comprise hydrogen H2 (recycle gas), are generally<br>
separated from the effluent exiting from the reactor and then reinjected into the reactor<br>
after passing through a treatment system. The presence of CO in the recycle gas thus<br>
proves to be damaging to the reactions for the hydrorefining of the petroleum fraction.<br>
The Applicant Company has proposed, in its French Patent Application 06.06892,<br>
a process for the hydrotreating of a mixture of a feedstock of petroleum origin of diesel<br>
fuel type and of a feedstock of biological origin of the vegetable oils and/or animal fats<br>
type, without a device for recycling liquid effluent at the top of the reactor. This mixture is<br>
introduced at the top of the reactor, in the manner of a conventional feedstock. The process<br>
described in this patent application, in one of its alternative forms, comprises a unit for the<br>
separation and treatment of the carbon monoxide present in the recycle gases.<br>
Nevertheless, there exists still a need in the industry to improve the performance of<br>
the process for hydrotreating a mixture of a feedstock of petroleum origin and of a<br>
feedstock of biological origin, while limiting the formation of gases of the CH4 type, and<br>
also H2O.<br>
In particular, when triglycerides are added in a diesel fuel feedstock, it is necessary<br>
to increase the amount of hydrogen H2 supplied in order to cover an increased<br>
consumption of H2 and to increase the temperature of the reaction, or the volume of<br>
catalyst, if it is desired to maintain the same hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity, that is<br>
to say if it is desired to achieve the same level of sulphur at the outlet in comparison with a<br>
conventional HDS.<br>
However, a higher reaction temperature results in a reduction in the duration of a<br>
cycle, so that it is preferable to be able to reduce this temperature in order to increase this<br>
duration. It is also preferable to limit the consumption of H2 for economic reasons.<br><br>
To this end, the invention provides a process for the catalytic hydrotreating of a<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin of diesel fuel type and of a feedstock of biological origin<br>
based on vegetable oils and/or animal fats in a stationary bed hydrotreating unit, the said<br>
process being characterized in that the feedstock of petroleum origin is introduced into the<br>
said unit upstream of the feedstock of biological origin.<br>
To this end, another subject-matter of the invention is a hydrotreating unit for the<br>
implementation of the said process, and a corresponding hydrorefining unit.<br>
Within the meaning of the present invention, the term "feedstock of biological<br>
origin" is understood to mean any renewable feedstock commonly defined by the term<br>
"biomass".<br>
Due to its introduction upstream of the feedstock of biological origin, the treatment<br>
of the feedstock of petroleum origin is not disturbed by the treatment of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin. It is then possible to carry out the reactions for hydrorefining the<br>
petroleum fraction under more favourable conditions in comparison with a joint<br>
introduction of the two types of feedstocks.<br>
This is because the hydrodesulphurization of the feedstock of petroleum origin is<br>
not disturbed by the introduction of the feedstock of biological origin which takes place<br>
downstream. Thus, the hydrodeoxygenation of the feedstock of biological origin takes<br>
place downstream of the hydrodesulphurization of the petroleum fraction, so that the<br>
hydrodesulphurization can be carried out without the inhibiting effect of the CO and of the<br>
other gases formed during the reaction for the hydrodeoxygenating of the triglycerides of<br>
the feedstock of biological origin and so that the hydrogen partial pressure will not be<br>
lowered by the reaction for the hydrorefining of the feedstock of biological origin, which<br>
makes it possible to maintain a high hydrodesulphurization catalytic activity.<br>
The downstream introduction of the feedstock of biological origin also makes it<br>
possible to carry out the hydrodeoxygenating of the latter under more favourable<br>
conditions (lower hydrogen partial pressure, lower temperature and the like) which limit<br>
the formation of CH4 and H2O, which reduces the H2 consumption and the exthermocity of<br>
the reaction.<br>
This is because the cracking reactions which occur during the deoxygenation of the<br>
feedstock of biological origin (by decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation) result in the<br>
detachment of a carbon at the chain end, which will bring about a thermodynamic<br><br>
equilibrium between CO/CO2/CH4 by the CO shift reaction (CO+H2OCO2+H2) and the<br>
reactions for the methanation of CO (CO+3H2CH4+H2O) and of CO2 (C02+4H2
&gt;CH4+2H2O).<br>
Moreover, the CO/CO2 ratio is always under the control of the equilibrium constant<br>
of the CO shift reaction.<br>
Thus, a reduction in the concentration of CO, the inhibiting effect of which is a<br>
problem, in favour of the concentration of CO2, which can be more easily removed, for<br>
example by washing with amines, is obtained by:<br>
-	the decrease in the H2 partial pressure, obtained according to the invention in that<br>
a large proportion of the hydrogen is consumed by the hydrotreating of the diesel fuel<br>
feedstock upstream of the section for the hydrodeoxygenating of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin,<br>
-	a shorter residence time of the feedstock of biological origin, obtained according<br>
to the invention in that it is possible to reduce the volume of catalyst downstream of the<br>
region for injection of the biological feedstock,<br>
-	a treatment of the feedstock of biological origin at the lowest possible<br>
temperature, which can be obtained in an alternative form of the invention described later,<br>
-	the addition of water, which can be obtained in another alternative form of the<br>
invention described later.<br>
-	the removal of the carbon monoxide from the recycle gas of the unit, as described<br>
later.<br>
Another advantage of the process according to the invention is the dilution of the<br>
feedstock of biological origin by the partially hydrotreated feedstock of petroleum origin<br>
resulting from the introduction of the feedstock of biological origin downstream of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin in the hydrotreating unit.<br>
This is because the hydrotreating of the feedstocks of biological origin based on<br>
vegetable and/or animal oils is highly exothermic and requires a means of control of the<br>
reaction temperature, such as the use of a large dilution volume. For this reason, to date,<br>
these vegetable and/or animal oils were treated in dedicated units with high recycling of<br>
liquid effluent.<br><br>
It is thus possible to limit, indeed even to eliminate, the recycling of liquid effluent<br>
by using the process according to the invention in comparison with the known processes<br>
for refining a feedstock of biological origin alone.<br>
The process according to the invention also makes it possible:<br>
-	to minimize the formation of methane (CH4)<br>
-	to improve the properties of the diesel fuel produced: cetane number, density,<br>
distillation, and the like.<br>
-	to increase the volume of diesel fuel produced with the same feedstock of petroleum<br>
origin, which perfectly meets current requirements in Europe, where there is a lack of<br>
diesel fuel.<br>
The process according to the invention furthermore makes it possible to use<br>
different catalysts in each of the catalytic regions where the feedstocks of petroleum and<br>
biological origin are injected: for example C0M0 for the region for hydrorefining the<br>
petroleum fraction and preferably NiMo for the second region where the triglycerides are<br>
treated.<br>
In a first alternative form of the process according to the invention, the<br>
hydrotreating unit is formed of a single reactor into which the feedstocks of petroleum and<br>
biological origin are injected.<br>
This alternative form exhibits the advantage of making possible the use of an<br>
existing hydrotreating unit to which will have been added an inlet for the feedstock of<br>
biological origin.<br>
In a second alternative form, the hydrotreating unit is formed of two separate<br>
reactors, the feedstock of petroleum origin being injected into the first reactor and the<br>
feedstock of biological origin being injected into the second reactor as a mixture with the<br>
liquid effluent exiting from the first reactor.<br>
This alternative form exhibits the advantage of making possible the treatment of<br>
the feedstock of biological origin at a lower temperature than the temperature for treatment<br>
of the feedstock of petroleum origin. This is because the hydrotreating of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin can take place at a lower temperature so that it is not necessary to heat the<br>
feedstock a great detail in order to treat it. Moreover, most of the hydrotreating of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin has already taken place in the first reactor; the second<br>
reactor then makes possible the hydrofinishing of the treatment of the feedstock of<br><br>
petroleum origin and does not require temperatures which are so high. This hydrofinishing<br>
makes it possible to obtain a much lower sulphur content in comparison with the contents<br>
usually obtained in hydrorefining.<br>
Moreover, generally, reactions for the recombination of olefins with H2S, which are<br>
favoured at high temperature, are the cause of the formation of mercaptans and make it<br>
difficult to obtain diesel fuels with a very low sulphur content. In point of fact, treatment<br>
conditions at a lower reaction temperature in the second reactor are favourable to the<br>
minimizing of these recombination reactions, which makes it possible to obtain a product<br>
with a very low sulphur content (
the first reactor for a given target for sulphur produced.<br>
This lower temperature in the second reactor also makes it possible to improve the<br>
thermal stability of the feedstock of biological origin, in particular when the liquid effluent<br>
exiting from the first reactor is cooled prior to being mixed with the feedstock of<br>
biological origin. It is possible in particular to recover the heat from this effluent and to<br>
thus lower the temperature of the latter in order to heat the feedstock of petroleum origin,<br>
and if appropriate the feedstock of biological origin, before they enter their respective<br>
reactors.<br>
The exothermicity of the reaction for hydrotreating the feedstock of biological<br>
origin additionally requires a large dilution volume which is provided by the partially<br>
hydrotreated feedstock of petroleum origin exiting from the first reactor.<br>
The lowering of the temperature of the second reactor also favours a reduction in<br>
the production of CO (see above).<br>
Finally, to carry out the hydrodesulphurization reactions and the<br>
hydrodeoxygenating reactions in two separate reactors makes possible independent<br>
management of the catalysts in each of the reactors and makes possible the production of<br>
biomass-free diesel fuels. It is possible, for this, either to isolate the second reactor, in<br>
order to use only the first reactor, or to stop the feeding with vegetable oils and/or animal<br>
fats and use the two reactors for the hydrotreating of the diesel fuel feedstock.<br>
In a third alternative form of the process according to the invention, the<br>
hydrotreating unit is formed of two separate reactors. The feedstock of petroleum origin is<br><br>
injected into the first reactor and the feedstock of biological origin is injected partly into<br>
the first reactor and partly into the second reactor, and the liquid effluent exiting from the<br>
first reactor is injected into the second reactor.<br>
Advantageously, the space velocity (HSV) of the feedstock of petroleum origin is<br>
less than the space velocity of the feedstock of biological origin, as a mixture with the<br>
effluent resulting from the treatment of the feedstock of petroleum origin.<br>
Under the conditions of the process (P, T°), the formation of CH4 and H2O is thus<br>
slowed down because the reactions are limited kinetically (see the CO shift and<br>
methanation reactions described above). This results in a lower consumption of H2 and in<br>
the production of a recycle gas which is more concentrated in hydrogen.<br>
Advantageously, the feedstock of petroleum origin of diesel fuel type is chosen<br>
from the diesel fuel fractions originating from the distillation of a crude oil and/or of a<br>
synthetic crude resulting from the treatment of oil shales or of heavy and extraheavy crude<br>
oils or of the effluent from the Fischer-Tropsch process, the diesel fuel fractions resulting<br>
from various conversion processes, in particular those resulting from catalytic and/or<br>
thermal cracking (FCC, coking, visbreaking, and the like).<br>
In particular, the feedstock of biological origin based on vegetable oils and/or<br>
animal fats is introduced up to a level of 30% by weight.<br>
More particularly, the level of feedstock of biological origin based on vegetable<br>
oils and/or animal fats is preferably less than or equal to 15% by weight. This is because<br>
the introduction of such a level of feedstock of biological origin only very slightly affects<br>
the low-temperature properties of the final product. In particular, the cloud point of the<br>
final effluent generally exhibits only a difference of 1°C with respect to the effluent<br>
obtained without injection of biomass. This result, which differs from that which the laws<br>
of mixtures would have predicted, is highly advantageous as it demonstrates the synergy,<br>
during the process according to the invention, between the two types of feedstocks.<br>
The introduction of high levels of feedstock of biological origin is made possible<br>
by virtue of the use of the hydrotreated feedstock of petroleum origin as diluent, without<br>
the need for recirculation of liquid effluent upstream of the introduction of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin.<br>
The vegetable or animal oils present in the feedstock of biological origin used<br>
according to the invention are composed predominantly of fatty acid triglycerides (&gt; 90%<br><br>
by weight), the chain lengths of which depend on the nature of the oil used. They can also<br>
comprise fatty acids. Within the meaning of the invention, the vegetable oils and animal<br>
fats can also comprise fatty acid esters.<br>
In the context of the invention , the vegetable oils and animal fats can be used<br>
crude. However, they are preferably refined in order to prevent fouling of the hydrotreating<br>
unit. In this case, the term "degummed oils" is used, that is to say after withdrawal of a<br>
large portion of the phospholipids.<br>
Advantageously, the catalytic region for injection of the feedstock of biological<br>
origin comprises a first metal trap catalytic bed known per se. These metal traps are<br>
generally composed of macroporous alumina. The purpose of using such a commercially<br>
known metal trap is to free the vegetable oils and/or animal fats from the impurities which<br>
they might contain (Na, K, CI and the like).<br>
The vegetable oils can in particular be palm oil, soybean oil. rapeseed oil.<br>
sunflower oil, linseed oil, rice bran oil, maize oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, pine oil,<br>
peanut oil, palm kernel oil. coconut oil, babasu oil or a mixture of two or more of these<br>
oils. These oils will essentially produce C12 to C18 paraffins.<br>
Palm oil is particularly preferred as this is one of the oils comprising the shortest<br>
carbon chains, with close to 50% of C16 chains. As palm oil is one of the most saturated<br>
oils, its hydrotreating requires a lower amount of hydrogen in comparison with the other<br>
oils. Furthermore, the thermal stability of palm oil limits the fouling of the heat exchangers<br>
situated upstream of the reactor in a conventional hydrorefining unit.<br>
Palm oil additionally gives the advantage of having its profile centred on that of the<br>
diesel fuel feedstock, which limits the disruption to the latter, while being economic and of<br>
not being used to any great extent in the human diet.<br>
Use may be made, as animal fats, for example, offish fat. of animal oil (known as<br>
tall oil).<br>
A particularly advantageous way of using the invention is thus to preferably use<br>
palm oil or any other vegetable oil or oil of animal origin capable of producing, by<br>
hydrotreating, a maximum of C15 to C18 paraffins, so as to bring about a large increase in<br>
the cetane index of the feedstocks produced while reducing as much as possible the density<br>
and to better enhance in value the bases with a low cetane index and a high density, such<br>
as LCO (Light Cycle Oil), which is characterized by a high density and a very low cetane<br><br>
index, and the diesel fuels resulting from sour crudes, which exhibit excellent low-<br>
temperature properties but have the characteristics of exhibiting a high density and a low<br>
cetane index.<br>
According to a specific characteristic of the invention, use is made of an amount of<br>
hydrogen introduced into the first catalytic region of from 50 to 1000 Normal litres of H2<br>
per litre of feedstock of petroleum origin, preferably from 100 to 500 Normal litres of H2<br>
per litre of petroleum feedstock and more preferably still from 120 to 450 Normal litres of<br>
H2 per litre of feedstock of petroleum origin.<br>
The hydrogen coverage in the second catalytic region, according to a specific<br>
characteristic of the invention, is from 50 to 2000 Normal litres of H2 per litre of total<br>
feedstock (feedstock of biological origin, as a mixture with the effluent resulting from the<br>
treatment of the feedstock of petroleum origin), preferably from 150 to 1500 Normal litres<br>
of H2 per litre of total feedstock and more preferably still from 200 to 1000 Normal litres<br>
of H2 per litre of total feedstock.<br>
According to a specific characteristic of the invention, the temperature of the first<br>
catalytic region for treatment of the feedstock of petroleum origin is from 320 to 420°C,<br>
preferably from 340 to 400°C. According to another preferred characteristic of the<br>
invention, the temperature of the second catalytic region for treatment of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin, as a mixture with the effluent resulting from the treatment of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin, is from 250 to 420°C, preferably from 280 to 350°C.<br>
According to a specific characteristic of the invention, the various feedstocks are<br>
treated at a pressure of 25 to 150 bar, preferably of 30 to 70 bar.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the HSV of the feedstock of<br>
petroleum origin in the first catalytic region is from 0.3 to 5, preferably from 0.6 to 3.<br>
The HSV in the second catalytic region of the total feedstock (feedstock of<br>
biological origin, as a mixture with the effluent resulting from the treatment of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin) is from 0.5 to 10, preferably from I to 5.<br>
Advantageously, according to the invention, the feedstock of petroleum origin is<br>
injected into a first catalytic region of the hydrotreating unit and the feedstock of biological<br>
origin is injected into a second catalytic region of the hydrotreating unit situated<br>
downstream of the first catalytic region.<br><br>
It is thus possible to use specific catalysts in each catalytic region and to thus<br>
promote the hydrodesulphurization or hydrodeoxygenating reactions.<br>
According to a specific characteristic of the invention, the feedstock of biological<br>
origin is treated over at least one catalytic bed in the hydrotreating unit, the catalytic bed<br>
comprising at least one catalyst based on metal oxides chosen from oxides of metals from<br>
Group VI-B (Mo, W. and the like) and VIII-B (Co, Ni. Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and the like)<br>
supported on a support chosen from alumina, silica/alumina, zeolite, ferrierite, phosphated<br>
alumina, phosphated silica/alumina, and the like. Preferably, the catalyst used will be<br>
NiMo, CoMo, NiW, PtPd or a mixture of two or more of these. The catalyst used can also<br>
be based on metals in the bulk state, such as the commercially known catalyst of Nebula<br>
type.<br>
According to another specific characteristic of the invention, the feedstock of<br>
biological origin introduced into the hydrotreating unit is treated over at least one catalytic<br>
bed at least partially comprising a catalyst with an isomerizing role based on nickel oxides<br>
on an acidic support, such as amorphous silica/alumina, zeolite, ferrierite, phosphated<br>
alumina, phosphated silica/alumina, and the like.<br>
Catalytic beds comprising NiW oxides exhibit the advantage of promoting<br>
isomerization reactions, which can make it possible to improve, that is to say to reduce, the<br>
cloud point of the finished product. In particular, in the case of a diesel fuel feedstock<br>
comprising a high cloud point, a catalytic bed comprising NiW, and preferably NiW<br>
oxides on amorphous silica/alumina, zeolite, ferrierite, phosphated alumina or phosphated<br>
silica/alumina, by promoting isomerization reactions, will make it possible to very<br>
markedly reduce the cloud point of the finished product.<br>
Catalytic beds comprising catalysts of NiMo oxide type have a high hydrogenating<br>
and hydrodeoxygenating power for triglycerides.<br>
Advantageously, the first catalytic region intended for the treatment of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin comprises one or more catalyst beds comprising catalysts<br>
which exhibit a good performance in hydrodesulphurization, while the second catalytic<br>
region intended for the treatment of the feedstock of biological origin comprises one or<br>
more catalyst beds comprising catalysts exhibiting a good performance for the<br>
deoxygenation of the triglycerides of the feedstock (for example based on NiMo) and/or<br>
catalysts promoting isomerization reactions. Preferably, in the final bed of the second<br><br>
catalytic region, use will be made of a catalyst with an isomerizing role which makes it<br>
possible to improve the low-temperature properties of the product. This catalyst can be<br>
composed of nickel oxides on an acidic support, such as amorphous silica/alumina, zeolite,<br>
ferrierite. phosphated alumina, phosphated silica/alumina, and the like. Preferably, NiW<br>
will be used.<br>
Advantageously, water is injected into the hydrotreating unit in the region for<br>
treatment of the feedstock of biological origin. This injection of water makes it possible to<br>
shift the equilibrium of the CO shift reaction towards the conversion of CO to CO2, which<br>
can be much more easily removed. The conversion to CO2 and H2 of the CO produced by<br>
the hydrodeoxygenation reaction is thus promoted, while limiting the methanation reaction<br>
which produces methane CH4, which results in a decrease in the exothermicity and in the<br>
H2 consumption.<br>
In a particularly advantageous alternative form of the process comprising a<br>
treatment of recycle gas resulting from the hydrotreating of the total feedstock before it is<br>
reinjected into the hydrotreating unit, an additional treatment is carried out on the carbon<br>
monoxide present in the said recycle gas.<br>
It is thus possible not to reinject carbon monoxide into the reactor in order not to<br>
risk inhibiting the catalyst.<br>
In particular, such a treatment of the CO can be carried out when the CO content of<br>
the recycle gases reaches a predetermined value.<br>
The separation and the treatment of the carbon monoxide can be carried out by the<br>
introduction, into the system for treating the recycle gases, of a device for the separation<br>
and treatment of carbon monoxide. In particular, it is possible to use CO conversion<br>
systems (referred to as CO shift systems by experts in this field), such as those generally<br>
supplied by hydrogen unit manufacturers. Thus, preferably, the carbon monoxide is treated<br>
by means of a CO conversion unit using the CO shift reaction. The CO is thus converted to<br>
CO2, which can be more easily removed.<br>
It is also possible to use a PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) treatment unit. This<br>
technology is known per se. The adsorbents are selected according to the nature of the<br>
impurities to be removed from the hydrogen-carrying streams, which are. in our case,<br>
carbon monoxide CO and optionally methane CH4. ethane C2H6, propane C3H8, and the<br>
like.<br><br>
Preferably, the gases thus separated are used in a steam reformer, such as a steam<br>
methane reformer (SMR). The CO and the other products from the deoxygenation of the<br>
feedstock of biological origin are thus enhanced in value as synthesis gas for the<br>
production of a hydrogen-comprising gas of biological origin. By using this configuration,<br>
the CO is thus enhanced in value and it is thus not necessary, in order to avoid its<br>
inhibiting effect, to reduce its concentration in favour of the concentration of CO2 which<br>
can be more easily removed.<br>
Advantageously, a treatment is additionally carried out during which the carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2) and the hydrogen sulphide (H2S) present in the said recycle gas are<br>
separated and treated before the reinjection of the recycle gas into the hydrotreating unit.<br>
This treatment is carried out. for example, by passing the recycle gas into an amine<br>
absorber. This additional treatment thus makes it possible to remove, from the circuit, the<br>
gases to be treated, that is to say CO2 and H2S.<br>
Another particularly advantageous way of using the invention, here also as soon as<br>
the level of vegetable oils and/or animal fats is high, is to compensate for the<br>
exothermicity which necessarily results from the addition of these oils.<br>
Thus, advantageously, the exothermicity of the hydrotreating of the feedstock is<br>
controlled by means of temperature control systems. In a conventional hydrotreating unit,<br>
these are. for example, the improvement in the liquid/gas distribution, gas and/or liquid<br>
quenches (that is to say, the supply of cold gases or liquids to the reactor), distribution of<br>
the catalyst volume over several catalytic beds, preheating control of the feedstock at the<br>
inlet of the reactor, in particular by action on the furnace and/or heat exchangers situated<br>
upstream of the reactor, on bypass lines, and the like, to lower the temperature at the inlet<br>
of the reactor.<br>
According to a first alternative form of the invention, preference will be given to<br>
the addition of a liquid (liquid quench) to control the exothermicity.<br>
This liquid can, for example, be composed of a portion of the hydrorefined<br>
feedstock exiting from the hydrorefining unit. It is introduced in the region for treating the<br>
feedstock of biological origin, in particular when the hydrotreating unit comprises a single<br>
reactor.<br><br>
When the hydrotreating unit comprises two reactors, this liquid can be composed of<br>
a portion of the effluent from the first reactor. It is likewise introduced in the region for<br>
treatment of the feedstock of biological origin.<br>
According to a second alternative form of the invention in which two separate<br>
reactors are used, a temperature control system consists in recovering the heat from the<br>
effluent exiting from the first reactor in order to lower its temperature before it is injected<br>
into the second reactor. This makes it possible to achieve a significant energy saving.<br>
Advantageously, according to the invention, the hydrotreating unit operates as a<br>
single-pass unit, without recycling of liquid effluent at the top of the reactor.<br>
The invention also relates to a hydrorefining unit comprising at least one catalytic<br>
hydrotreating unit as described hereafter, for the implementation of the said process.<br>
Advantageously, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises at least one reactor<br>
provided with a first inlet for the introduction of a feedstock of petroleum origin of diesel<br>
fuel type and a second inlet for the introduction of a feedstock of biological origin based<br>
on vegetable and/or animal oils, the second inlet being situated downstream of the first<br>
inlet.<br>
Advantageously, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises a first catalytic region<br>
intended for the treatment of the feedstock of petroleum origin and a second catalytic<br>
region situated downstream of the first catalytic region and intended for the treatment of<br>
the feedstock of biological origin diluted by the feedstock of petroleum origin exiting from<br>
the first catalytic region.<br>
In a first embodiment, this catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises a single reactor.<br>
In a second embodiment, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises two separate<br>
reactors, a first reactor provided with the said first inlet for the introduction of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin and a second reactor provided with the said second inlet for<br>
the introduction of the feedstock of biological origin, the said first reactor additionally<br>
comprising an outlet for the treated feedstock of petroleum origin, the said outlet joining<br>
the said second inlet of the second reactor.<br>
In a third embodiment, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises two separate<br>
reactors, a first reactor provided with the said first inlet for the introduction of the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin and with the said second inlet for the introduction of a<br>
portion of the feedstock of biological origin based on vegetable and/or animal oils, the<br><br>
second inlet being situated downstream of the first inlet, the said first reactor additionally<br>
comprising an outlet for the treated mixture of the two feedstocks, the said outlet joining<br>
the inlet of the second reactor, and the second reactor comprises a third inlet for the<br>
introduction of a portion of the feedstock of biological origin.<br>
Preferably, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises at least one catalytic bed<br>
comprising at least one catalyst based on metal oxides chosen from oxides of metals from<br>
Group VI-B (Mo, W, and the like) and VIII-B (Co, Ni, Pt, Pd. Ru, Rh. and the like)<br>
supported on a support chosen from alumina, silica/alumina, zeolite, ferrierite. phosphated<br>
alumina, phosphated silica/alumina, and the like, preferably NiMo, CoMo, NiW, PtPd or a<br>
mixture of two or more of these.<br>
Preferably, the catalytic hydrotreating unit comprises at least one catalytic bed at<br>
least partially comprising a catalyst with an isomerizing role preferably based on nickel<br>
oxides on an acidic support, such as amorphous silica/alumina, zeolite, ferrierite.<br>
phosphated alumina, phosphated silica/alumina, and the like.<br>
Preferably, the hydrorefining unit further comprises a separator which separates the<br>
liquid and vapour phases of the effluent exiting from the said hydrotreating unit and<br>
comprises, downstream of the separator, a unit for separation and treatment of the carbon<br>
monoxide (CO) present in the vapour phase of the effluent for the implementation of the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the hydrorefining comprises, downstream of the separator, a unit for<br>
separation and treatment of the carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) present<br>
in the vapour phase of the effluent for the implementation of the process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention is now described with reference to the appended nonlimiting<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a simplified diagram of a unit 1 for the conventional hydrorefining<br>
of a feedstock of diesel fuel type;<br>
-	Figure 2 is a simplified diagram of a separation section of a conventional<br>
hydrorefining unit;<br>
-	Figure 3 is a simplified diagram of a hydrotreating unit according to a first<br>
embodiment of the invention comprising a single reactor;<br><br>
Figure 4 is a simplified diagram of a hydrorefining unit comprising a<br>
hydrotreating unit according to a second embodiment of the invention<br>
comprising two reactors.<br>
Figure 1 represents a simplified diagram of a unit 1 for the conventional<br>
hydrorefining of a feedstock of diesel fuel type. This unit 1 comprises a reactor 2 into<br>
which the feedstock to be treated is introduced by means of a line 3. This reactor<br>
comprises one or more hydrorefining catalyst beds.<br>
A line 4 recovers the effluent at the outlet of the reactor 2 and conveys it to a<br>
separation section 5.<br>
A heat exchanger 6 is placed downstream of the reactor on the line 4 in order to<br>
heat the feedstock moving in the line 3 upstream of the reactor.<br>
Upstream of this heat exchanger 6, a line 7, connected to the line 3, contributes an<br>
H2-rich gas to the feedstock to be treated.<br>
Downstream of the heat exchanger 6 and upstream of the reactor 2. the feedstock<br>
mixed with the H2-rich gas moving in the line 3 is heated by a furnace 8.<br>
Thus, the feedstock is mixed with the hydrogen-rich gas and then brought to the<br>
reaction temperature by the heat exchanger 6 and the furnace 8 before it enters the reactor<br>
2. It subsequently passes into the reactor 2, in the vapour state if it is a light fraction and as<br>
a liquid/vapour mixture if it is a heavy fraction.<br>
At the outlet of the reactor, the mixture obtained is cooled and then separated in the<br>
separation section 5, which makes it possible to obtain:<br>
-	an H2S-rich sour gas G, a portion of which is reinjected into the H2-rich gas<br>
mixed with the feedstock by means of a line 9,<br>
-	light products L which result from the decomposition of the impurities. This is<br>
because the removal of sulphur, nitrogen, and the like, results in the destruction of<br>
numerous molecules and in the production of lighter fractions,<br>
-	a hydrorefined product H with a volatility similar to that of the feedstock but with<br>
improved characteristics.<br>
Conventionally, the effluent exiting from the reactor 2 is cooled and partially<br>
condensed and then enters the separation section 5.<br>
Such a separation section 5 generally comprises (Figure 2):<br><br>
-	a first high-pressure knockout vessel 10 which makes it possible to separate a<br>
hydrogen-rich gas G(H2) from the effluent, it being possible for this gas to be<br>
recycled,<br>
a second low-pressure (10 bar) knockout vessel 11 which separates the liquid<br>
and vapour phases obtained by reducing in pressure the liquid originating from<br>
the high-pressure knockout vessel 10. The gas G(H2,L H2S) obtained<br>
comprises mainly hydrogen, light hydrocarbons and a large part of the hydrogen<br>
sulphide formed in the reactor,<br>
-	a stripper 12, the role of which is to remove the residual H2S and light<br>
hydrocarbons L from the treated feedstock. The hydrorefined product H is<br>
withdrawn at the base of this stripper.<br>
a dryer 13, which makes it possible to remove the water dissolved by the hot<br>
hydrorefined product in the stripper.<br>
According to a first embodiment, a catalytic hydrotreating unit according to the<br>
invention is formed of a single reactor 20, as represented in Figure 3. This reactor 20 is<br>
provided with a first inlet 21 for the introduction of a feedstock of petroleum origin (Cp)<br>
of diesel fuel type and a second inlet 22 for the introduction of a feedstock of biological<br>
origin (Cb) based on vegetable and/or animal oils, the second inlet 22 being situated<br>
downstream of the first inlet 21.<br>
Preferably, the inlet 21 for the feedstock of petroleum origin is conventionally<br>
situated at the top of the reactor.<br>
The reactor 20 comprises several catalytic beds which are divided into two catalytic<br>
regions: a first region situated upstream of the second inlet 22, intended for the treatment<br>
of the feedstock of petroleum origin, and a second region B situated downstream of this<br>
second inlet 22, intended for the treatment of the feedstock of biological origin.<br>
The first catalytic region A will preferably comprise a catalyst which promotes the<br>
hydrodesulphurization of the feedstock of petroleum origin.<br>
The second catalytic region B will preferably comprise a catalyst which promotes<br>
the deoxygenation of the feedstock of biological origin. Advantageously, this region B<br>
comprises at least one first bed comprising an NiMo-based catalyst and a final bed<br>
comprising a catalyst with an isomerizing role which makes it possible to improve the<br>
low-temperature properties of the product.<br><br>
Furthermore, the reactor 20 comprises an inlet 23 for the introduction of hydrogen<br>
H2 in the first catalytic region A and preferably a second inlet 24 for introduction of<br>
hydrogen H2 in the second catalytic region B. these injections of H2 acting as gaseous<br>
quench.<br>
Finally, it is possible to allow an inlet 25 for the introduction of water in the<br>
catalytic region B, this injection B making it possible to promote the conversion to CO2 of<br>
the CO which may have been formed.<br>
The reactor forming the catalytic hydrotreating unit 20 according to the invention<br>
can be used in a conventional hydrorefining unit such as that described with reference to<br>
Figure 1, as replacement for the reactor 2 of this unit.<br>
According to a second embodiment, a catalytic hydrotreating unit according to the<br>
invention is formed of two reactors 30, 31. Figure 4 represents a hydrorefining unit<br>
equipped with such a catalytic hydrotreating unit.<br>
The diagram of this hydrorefining unit is very similar to that of the unit represented<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
The first reactor 30 of the catalytic hydrotreating unit according to the invention is<br>
preferably identical to the reactor 2 of Figure 1. The feedstock of petroleum origin Cp is<br>
conveyed to the top of this reactor by means of a line 32 but the liquid effluent exiting<br>
from this first reactor, instead of being directed to a separation section, is sent to the top of<br>
the second reactor 31 by means of a line 33.<br>
A line 34 conveying the feedstock of biological origin Cb joins the line 33 before it<br>
enters the top of the second reactor 31.<br>
A line 35 recovers the liquid effluent at the outlet of the second reactor 31 and<br>
conveys it to a separation section.<br>
Just as for a conventional unit, a heat exchanger 36 is placed downstream of the<br>
first reactor 30 on the line 33 in order to heat the feedstock Cp moving in the line 32<br>
upstream of the first reactor 30.<br>
Preferably, the hydrorefining unit according to the invention additionally comprises<br>
a second heat exchanger 37 placed downstream of the second reactor 31 on the line 35<br>
which also heats the feedstock Cp moving upstream of the first reactor 30. this second<br>
exchanger 37 being, for example, placed upstream of the first exchanger 36.<br><br>
Upstream of these heat exchangers 36 and 37, a line 38 connected to the line 32<br>
supplies an H2-rich gas to the feedstock Cp to be treated.<br>
Downstream of the heat exchangers 36, 37 and upstream of the first reactor 30, the<br>
feedstock of petroleum origin mixed with the H2-rich gas moving in the line 32 is heated<br>
by a furnace 39.<br>
The liquid effluent is cooled at the outlet of the second reactor 31 and then<br>
separated in a separation section which comprises a first high-pressure "hot" knockout<br>
vessel 40 which makes it possible to separate, from the effluent, a hydrogen-rich gas GlHl)<br>
also comprising CO and CO2. This gas G(H2) is conveyed to another low-pressure "cold"<br>
knockout vessel 41, then conveyed to a unit 42 for the treatment and separation of CO2, for<br>
example an amine absorber, and then to a unit 43 for the separation and treatment of CO of<br>
the PSA type. The CO separated in this unit 43, as well as the other gases separated, such<br>
as CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and the like, can advantageously be sent to an SMR unit for the<br>
production of hydrogen H2. This hydrogen can then optionally be returned in the line 44<br>
bringing back the recycle gas to the first reactor 30 as gaseous quench and in the line 38<br>
for the treatment of the feedstock Cp.<br>
The liquid effluent exiting from the first knockout vessel 40 is. for its part, directed<br>
to another low-pressure (10 bar) knockout vessel 45 which separates the liquid and vapour<br>
phases obtained by reducing in pressure the liquid originating from the high-pressure<br>
knockout vessel 40. The gas G(H2, L, H2S) obtained comprises mainly hydrogen, light<br>
hydrocarbons and a large part of the hydrogen sulphide formed in the reactor. The liquid<br>
effluent resulting from this knockout vessel 45 is conveyed to a steam stripper 46, the role<br>
of which is to remove the residual H2S and light hydrocarbons from the treated feedstock.<br>
The gaseous effluent exiting from the knockout vessel 45 can be sent to another knockout<br>
vessel 47 fed with the liquid effluent exiting from the knockout vessel 41, the liquid<br>
effluent of which is also conveyed to the stripper 46. The gas exiting from this knockout<br>
vessel 47 can be made use of.<br>
The hydrorefined product H is withdrawn at the base of this stripper 46.<br>
The separation unit described above and composed of the knockout vessels 40, 41,<br>
45 and 47, of the stripper 46 and of the treatment units 42, 43 can, of course, be used at the<br><br>
outlet of the single reactor described in Figure 3. Depending on the conditions, it is also<br>
possible to allow only two successive knockout vessels 40 and 41, the liquid effluents of<br>
which are directed directly to the stripper 46.<br>
A portion of the hydrorefined product H can be introduced into the second reactor<br>
via a line 48 in order to act as liquid quench. Heat exchangers 49. 50, respectively placed<br>
on the lines 34 and 32, can be used for the preheating of the feedstock of biological origin<br>
and of the feedstock of petroleum origin respectively.<br>
Just as in the preceding embodiment with one reactor, it is possible to allow for<br>
injection of water 51 into the second reactor 31.<br>
This unit thus makes it possible to carry out the hydrorefining of petroleum<br>
fractions in the first reactor 30 and to finish the hydrorefining of the petroleum fractions in<br>
the second reactor 31, and also to deoxygenate the triglycerides of the feedstock of<br>
biological origin.<br>
In addition, it is clearly apparent that the second reactor can be easily isolated from<br>
the circuit by means of valves, a bypass line directly conveying the liquid effluent exiting<br>
from the first reactor to the separation and treatment devices. Thus, this hydrorefining unit<br>
can be used for the hydrotreating of a feedstock of petroleum origin, with or without<br>
addition of a feedstock of biological origin.<br>
The following examples illustrate the advantages produced by the process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Feedstock studied<br>
The feedstock based on diesel fuel studied is composed of 30% of LCO (Light<br>
Cycle Oil) and of 70% of fractions of diesel fuel type originating from the straight-run<br>
(SR) distillation of a crude oil. The characteristics of this diesel fuel feedstock and those of<br>
the palm oil incorporated at approximately 15% by weight are listed in Tables 1 and 2<br>
respectively.<br><br><br><br><br>
Plant and operational conditions<br>
In Example 1, which acts as reference, the treatment is carried out on a unit<br>
comprising a single hydrotreating reactor in which the catalyst volume is 54.6 m3.<br><br>
Simultaneous feeding of palm oil and of the feedstock based on diesel fuel is carried out at<br>
the top of the reactor. The hydrogen partial pressure is 63 bar and the mean treatment<br>
temperature is 362°C. This temperature makes it possible to ensure a sulphur content of<br>
10 ppm starting from the feedstock treated here.<br>
tn Example 2 according to the invention, the treatment is carried out on a unit<br>
comprising two hydrotreating reactors. The feedstock based on diesel fuel is incorporated<br>
at the top of the first reactor and the feedstock based on palm oil is incorporated in the<br>
effluent from the first reactor, before entering the second reactor. The overall catalytic<br>
volume in the unit is 54.6 m3 (identical to that of Example I). The mean reaction<br>
temperature of the second reactor is 321°C and that of the first reactor is such that the unit<br>
(combination of the two reactors in series) makes it possible to ensure a sulphur content of<br>
10 ppm starting from the feedstock treated here.<br>
In Example 3 according to the invention, the treatment is also carried out on a unit<br>
comprising two hydrotreating reactors. The feedstock based on diesel fuel is incorporated<br>
at the top of the first reactor and the feedstock based on palm oil is incorporated in the<br>
effluent from the first reactor, before entering the second reactor. The overall catalytic<br>
volume is 47.4 m3. The mean reaction temperature in the first reactor is 362°C (identical to<br>
that of Example 1) and that of the second reactor is 321°C, which makes it possible for the<br>
unit (combination of the two reactors in series) to ensure a sulphur content of 10 ppm<br>
starting from the feedstock treated here.<br>
The reactors comprise a commercial hydrodesulphurization catalyst known to a<br>
person skilled in the art composed of porous alumina on which nickel and molybdenum<br>
oxides are deposited. This catalyst is provided in the form of extrudates with a diameter of<br>
1 to 2 mm and a trilobe shape. The loading density is 950 kg/m3 of catalyst charged to the<br>
unit.<br>
The hydrogen partial pressure at the inlet of the first reactor is 63 bar. The<br>
hydrogen coverage used in the first reactor for the examples shown is 350 Nl/1 (that is to<br>
say, the amount of Normal litres of hydrogen per litre of feedstock).<br>
A section for stripping the liquid effluent is present at the outlet of the reactor in<br>
order to remove the gasses, such as H2S. NH3. CO or CO2, when these compounds are<br>
present in the effluent.<br><br><br>
The comparison of Examples 1 and 2 shows that, using the same catalyst volume<br>
(54.6 m ), the use of the invention makes it possible to operate the first reactor at a<br>
temperature of 357°C instead of 362°C in the case of Example 1. This difference of 5°C<br>
has the consequence of producing a considerable energy saving, all the more so as a<br>
portion of the heat is recovered from the effluent from the first reactor. Moreover, as the<br>
conditions are less severe, the cycle time is found to be extended thereby. In this case, it is<br>
possible to expect to have a cycle time extended by at least 5 months. Furthermore, the<br>
second reactor in Example 2 will be characterized by a very long cycle time due to the<br>
relatively low operating temperature, which is nevertheless sufficient to produce a 10 ppm<br>
diesel fuel at the outlet.<br><br>
The comparison of Examples 1 and 3 shows that, at a same mean reaction<br>
temperature for the first reactor, the volume of catalyst necessary in order to obtain a<br>
10 ppm diesel fuel at the outlet is lower when the invention is employed. This is because<br>
the saving with regard to the first catalytic region is 7.2 m3 of catalyst volume, which<br>
implies a fall of 13% in the total catalyst volume for the unit. Furthermore, the second<br>
reactor in Example 2 will be characterized by a very long cycle time due to the relatively<br>
low operating temperature, which is nevertheless sufficient to produce a 10 ppm diesel fuel<br>
at the outlet.<br>
Production of CO. CO2, CH4 and H2O<br>
The production, at the outlet of the unit, of the gases CO, CO2. CH4 and H2O, with<br>
respect to the palm oil feedstock studied, is illustrated in Table 4.<br><br>
Table 4 demonstrates that the use of the invention exhibits the advantage of a<br>
reduction in the hydrogen H2 consumption. This is because the formation of methane<br>
(CH4) and of water (H2O) is reduced.<br>
Quality of the products<br>
The results of a detailed analysis of the effluent obtained for Examples 2 and 3 are<br>
combined in Table 5. The incorporation of palm oil as feedstock of a<br>
hydrodesulphurization unit, both by simultaneous incorporation at the top of the reactor<br><br>
and by use of the invention, has the consequence of adding normal paraffins to the final<br>
product, and the characteristics of the products obtained are found to be favourably<br>
affected thereby. In particular, it is found that the cloud point of the effluents is -3°C,<br>
whereas, with the incorporation of 15% of palm oil in the diesel fuel feedstock, a greater<br>
impact on the cloud point might have been expected.<br><br><br>
