				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an interlayer for<br>
laminated glass having an excellent heat ray shielding<br>
property and an excellent transparent property and<br>
laminated glass using this interlayer for laminated glass.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since in laminated glass, an object is hard to<br>
penetrate when the laminated glass is subjected to an<br>
external impact and even though it is broken by the object,<br>
fragments of broken glass seldom shatter and therefore it<br>
is safe, laminated glass is widely employed in the<br>
windowpanes of vehicles such as automobiles, aircrafts,<br>
buildings and the like. As laminated glass of this kind,<br>
there is widely used laminated glass obtained by bonding an<br>
interlayer for laminated glass, which comprises an adhesive<br>
resin, for example, a plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
such as a polyvinyl butyral resin plasticized with a<br>
plasticizer, between transparent glass plates.<br>
[0003]<br>
The laminated glass using the above conventional<br>
interlayer for laminated glass has high safety, however, it<br>
has low heat ray shielding property. Among light rays,<br>
infrared rays, having a wavelength of about 780 nm or more<br>
which is longer than that of visible light, have a smaller<br>
energy quantity than ultraviolet rays by about 10%, however,<br>
they have a large thermal effect, and when they are<br>
absorbed in a substance once, they are released in the form<br>
of heat and result in a temperature rise, and therefore<br><br>
they are generally referred to as heat rays.<br>
[0004]<br>
Thus, if it becomes possible to shield infrared rays<br>
(heat rays), having a large thermal effect, of light rays<br>
entering from windshields and side glass of automobiles,<br>
the heat ray shielding property is enhanced and a<br>
temperature rise of the interior of automobile can be<br>
inhibited. As a recent trend, an opening area of<br>
windowpanes in automobiles, buildings and the like<br>
increases and the necessity of enhancing the heat ray<br>
shielding property of the laminated glass and of imparting<br>
the heat ray shielding function to opening areas of these<br>
windowpanes increases.<br>
[0005]<br>
By the way, in Patent Document No. 1, there is<br>
disclosed an interlayer for laminated glass obtainable by<br>
dispersing heat ray shielding fine particles such as indium<br>
tin oxide fine particles and antimony-doped tin oxide fine<br>
particles having a heat ray shielding property, in an<br>
adhesive resin such as plasticized polyvinyl acetal resins,<br>
and laminated glass using this interlayer for laminated<br>
glass. Such an interlayer for laminated glass and<br>
laminated glass have a high heat ray shielding property and<br>
also an excellent transparency and are very useful for<br>
windowpanes of automobiles, buildings and the like.<br>
[0006]<br>
But, in such an interlayer for laminated glass and<br>
laminated glass having a heat ray shielding property, since<br>
the heat ray shielding fine particles dispersed in the<br>
interlayer shield visible light in a red color region due<br>
to its property and scatter visible light in a blue color<br>
region depending on their particle diameter, the resulting<br>
transmitted light shows yellow-greenish color tone, and the<br>
interlayer for laminated glass and the laminated glass to<br>
be obtained take on slightly yellow-greenish color.<br><br>
Therefore, when the concentration of the heat ray shielding<br>
fine particles is increased in order to attain a highly<br>
heat ray shielding property, a degree of yellow-green color<br>
tone is increased. Thus, since in applications requiring a<br>
transparent property which looks a natural color, it is<br>
impossible to enhance the concentration of the heat ray<br>
shielding fine particles, this method is not yet adequately<br>
satisfactory for the purpose of attaining a highly heat ray<br>
shielding property in a transparent condition and has the<br>
problem to be improved in this point.<br>
Patent Document No. 1: WO 01/25162<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS WHICH THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention resolves the above problems,<br>
and it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
interlayer for laminated glass and laminated glass which<br>
have an excellent heat ray shielding property and an<br>
excellent transparent property which looks a natural color.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE OBJECT<br>
[0008]<br>
The above object can be attained in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to an<br>
interlayer for laminated glass, which is formed by<br>
laminating a plurality of layers comprising an adhesive<br>
resin, a heat ray shielding resin layer containing a heat<br>
ray shielding fine particle and a color tone compensation<br>
resin layer toned to have a color complementary to the<br>
color tone of the heat ray shielding fine particle being<br>
laminated. Here, the above adhesive resin is preferably a<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin.<br><br>
And, it is preferred that an ultraviolet absorbing<br>
resin layer is further laminated.<br>
[0010]<br>
Laminated glass, wherein the interlayer for laminated<br>
glass of the present invention is bonded between<br>
transparent glass plates, also constitutes the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0011]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in detail.<br>
As the resin constituting the heat ray shielding<br>
resin layer, the color tone compensation resin layer and<br>
the ultraviolet absorbing resin layer, there are given<br>
adhesive resins used for conventional interlayers for<br>
laminated glass, for example, a plasticized polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin, an ethylene-vinyl acetate type copolymer<br>
resin, an ethylene-(meth)acrylic ester type copolymer resin,<br>
a polyurethane elastomer type resin. As the ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate type copolymer resin, a resin containing a<br>
component of vinyl acetate in an amount of 18 to 35% by<br>
weight as its constituent component is preferable.<br>
The laminated glass using an interlayer comprising<br>
these adhesive resins has such basic performance required<br>
for laminated glass that transparency is excellent, weather<br>
resistance is high, adhesive property is good, penetration<br>
resistance is high, and fragments of broken glass seldom<br>
shatter. Among others, plasticized polyvinyl acetal resins<br>
are superior in a performance balance and preferred.<br>
[0012]<br>
The polyvinyl acetal resin used in the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited and a resin used<br>
conventionally as a resin for an interlayer for laminated<br>
glass can be used, and for example, resins having an<br>
acetalization degree of 60 to 75 mole% and an average<br>
polymerization degree of 800 to 3000 are suitably used.<br><br>
When the average polymerization degree is less than 800,<br>
the strength of a resin film become too low and therefore<br>
the penetration resistance of the laminated glass to be<br>
obtained may be deteriorated, and on the contrary when the<br>
average polymerization degree is more than 3000, the<br>
moldability of the resin film becomes low or the strength<br>
of the resin film become too high and therefore the impact<br>
absorbing property of the laminated glass to be obtained<br>
may be deteriorated. When the acetalization degree is less<br>
than 60 mole%, the compatibility with a plasticizer is<br>
reduced and therefore it may become difficult to contain a<br>
plasticizer in an amount required for securing the<br>
penetration resistance and the hygroscopic property of a<br>
resin film increases, and on the contrary when the<br>
acetalization degree is more than 75 mole%, the strength of<br>
a resin film become too low and therefore the penetration<br>
resistance of the laminated glass to be obtained may be<br>
deteriorated. Among others, a polyvinyl butyral resin is<br>
preferred from the viewpoint of having proper adhesive<br>
property to glass, excellent transparency and excellent<br>
weather resistance.<br>
[0013]<br>
Incidentally, an average polymerization degree and an<br>
acetalization degree of polyvinyl acetal resins such as<br>
polyvinyl butyral resin can be measured, for example,<br>
according to JIS K 6728 "Testing methods for polyvinyl<br>
butyral" or by a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method.<br>
[0014]<br>
In order to obtain the above polyvinyl acetal resin,<br>
a publicly known method is employed.  For example,<br>
predetermined polyvinyl alcohol is used and dissolved in<br>
warm water, and to the obtained aqueous solution,<br>
predetermined acid catalyst and aldehyde were added while<br>
keeping the aqueous solution at a predetermined temperature,<br>
for example, 0 to 95°C, to allow an acetalization reaction<br><br>
to proceed while stirring. Next, a reaction temperature is<br>
raised to age the reactant and to complete the reaction,<br>
and then the reactant is neutralized, washed with water and<br>
dried, and whereby the powder of polyvinyl acetal resin can<br>
be obtained.<br>
[0015]<br>
Here, the above polyvinyl alcohol is normally<br>
obtained by saponifying polyvinyl acetate, and polyvinyl<br>
alcohol having a saponification degree of 80 to 99.8 mole%<br>
is generally used. This polyvinyl alcohol preferably has<br>
an average polymerization degree of 200 to 3000. When the<br>
average polymerization degree is less than 200, the<br>
penetration resistance of the laminated glass to be<br>
obtained may be deteriorated, and on the contrary when the<br>
average polymerization degree is more than 3000, the<br>
moldability of the resin film may be deteriorated, and<br>
rigidity of the resin film become too high and therefore<br>
the processability may be deteriorated. More preferable<br>
average polymerization degree is 500 to 2000.<br>
Incidentally, an average polymerization degree and a<br>
saponification degree of polyvinyl alcohol resins can be<br>
measured according to, for example, JIS K 6726 "Testing<br>
methods for polyvinyl alcohol".<br>
[0016]<br>
The above aldehyde is not particularly limited,<br>
aldehydes having 1 to 10 carbon atoms are generally<br>
employed and for example, n-butyl aldehyde, iso-butyl<br>
aldehyde, n-valeraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyl aldehyde, n-hexyl<br>
aldehyde, n-octyl aldehyde, n-nonyl aldehyde, n-decyl<br>
aldehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are<br>
given. Among others, n-butyl aldehyde, n-hexyl aldehyde<br>
and n-valeraldehyde are suitably used. Butyl aldehyde<br>
having 4 carbon atoms is particularly preferably used.<br>
[0017]<br>
The above plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin can be<br><br>
obtained by making the above polyvinyl acetal resin contain<br>
a plasticizer. The above plasticizer is not particularly<br>
limited and publicly known plasticizers which are generally<br>
used as a plasticizer for this kind of interlayers can be<br>
used, and there are given organic type plasticizers such as<br>
monobasic organic acid type ester and polybasic organic<br>
acid type ester; and phosphoric acid type plasticizers such<br>
 as organic phosphoric acid and organic phosphorous acid.<br>
These plasticizers may be used alone or may be used in<br>
combination of two or more species and are selectively used<br>
depending on the species of the polyvinyl acetal resin in<br>
consideration of the compatibility with resins.<br>
[0018]<br>
The above monobasic organic acid ester type<br>
plasticizer is not particularly limited and includes, for<br>
example, glycol type esters obtained by a reaction between<br>
glycol such as triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and<br>
tripropylene glycol and monobasic organic acid such as<br>
butyric acid, isobutyric acid, capric acid, 2-ethylbutyric<br>
acid, heptylic acid, n-octylic acid, 2-ethylhexylic acid,<br>
pelargonic acid (n-nonylic acid) and decylic acid. Among<br>
others, there are suitably used monobasic organic acid<br>
esters of triethylene glycol such as triethylene glycol-<br>
dicapric acid ester, triethylene glycol-di-2-ethylbutyric<br>
acid ester, triethylene glycol-di-n-octyl acid ester,<br>
triethylene glycol-di-2-ethylhexylic acid ester.<br>
[0019]<br>
The above polybasic organic acid ester type<br>
plasticizer is not particularly limited and includes, for<br>
example, esters of polybasic organic acid such as adipic<br>
acid, sebacic acid and azelaic acid, and straight-chain or<br>
branched alcohols having 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Among others,<br>
dibutyl sebacate, dioctyl azelate, and dibutyl carbitol<br>
adipate are suitably used.<br><br>
The above organic phosphate type plasticizer is not<br>
particularly limited and includes, for example,<br>
tributoxyethyl phosphate, isodecylphenyl phosphate and<br>
triisopropyl phosphite.<br>
[0021]<br>
Particularly in these plasticizers, triethylene<br>
glycol-di-2-ethylbutyrate (3GH), triethylene glycol-di-2-<br>
ethylhexanoate (3GO), tetraethylene glycol-di-2-<br>
ethylhexanoate (4GO) and tetraethylene glycol di-2-butyl<br>
sebacate are preferably used.<br>
[0022]<br>
An amount of these plasticizers to be blended is<br>
preferably 20 to 60 parts by weight with respect to 100<br>
parts by weight of polyvinyl acetal resin. When the amount<br>
to be blended is less than 20 parts by weight, an impact<br>
absorbing property of the interlayer and the laminated<br>
glass to be obtained may become insufficient, and on the<br>
contrary when it is more than 60 parts by weight, the<br>
plasticizer bleeds out and an optical strain of the<br>
interlayer and the laminated glass to be obtained may<br>
become large or transparency and adhesive property between<br>
the glass plate and the interlayer may be impaired. More<br>
preferable amount of the plasticizers to be blended is 30<br>
to 50 parts by'weight.<br>
[0023]<br>
The heat ray shielding fine particles used in the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, but for<br>
example, at least one species selected from the group<br>
consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO) fine particles,<br>
antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) fine particles, aluminum-<br>
doped zinc oxide (AZO) fine particles, indium-doped zinc<br>
oxide (IZO) fine particles, tin-doped zinc oxide fine<br>
particles, silicon-doped zinc oxide fine particles, zinc<br>
antimonates, lanthanum hexaboride fine particles and cerium<br>
hexaboride fine particles is suitably used.<br><br>
In a resin layer in which these heat ray shielding<br>
fine particles are dispersed, all transmitted colors takes<br>
on light yellow-green color and the resin layer has an<br>
excellent function of shielding infrared rays (heat rays).<br>
[0024]<br>
The above heat ray shielding fine particles<br>
preferably have an average particle diameter of 80 nm or<br>
smaller. When the average particle diameter is larger than<br>
80 nm, scattering of visible light due to the heat ray<br>
shielding fine particles becomes remarkable and therefore<br>
the transparency of the interlayer for laminated glass to<br>
be obtained may be impaired. Consequently, when the<br>
laminated glass is formed, haze is deteriorated and it<br>
becomes impossible to satisfy, for example, a high level of<br>
transparency required in windshields of automobiles. A<br>
more preferable average particle diameter is 10 to 80 nm.<br>
Incidentally, particle diameters and an average particle<br>
diameter of the heat ray shielding fine particles can be<br>
measured by a dynamic light scattering method by using Ar<br>
laser as a light source using a light scattering measuring<br>
apparatus (for example, "DLS-6000AL" manufactured by Otsuka<br>
Electronics Co., Ltd.)<br>
[0025]<br>
Preferably, such heat ray shielding fine particles<br>
are uniformly dispersed in the above heat ray shielding<br>
resin layer. By uniformly dispersing them, the heat ray<br>
shielding property becomes high throughout the whole layer,<br>
and adhesive force between the glass plate and the<br>
interlayer becomes controllable and penetration resistance<br>
of the interlayer for laminated glass and the laminated<br>
glass becomes excellent.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the above heat ray shielding resin layer, the<br>
above heat ray shielding fine particles are preferably<br>
dispersed so as to be 1/µm2 or less in the density of<br><br>
particles having a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger.<br>
That is, when a photograph of the interlayer for laminated<br>
glass of the present invention is taken and observed with a<br>
transmission electron microscope, the above heat ray<br>
shielding fine particles are preferably dispersed so as to<br>
be in a state that the above heat ray shielding fine<br>
particles having a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger<br>
are not observed or if such fine particles are observed,<br>
when this heat ray shielding fine particle having a<br>
particle diameter of 100 nm or larger is positioned at the<br>
center of a frame of 1 µm2, another heat ray shielding fine<br>
particle having a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger is<br>
not observed in this frame of 1 µm2. Thereby, when the<br>
laminated glass is formed, a low haze value and excellent<br>
transparency and high heat shielding property are obtained<br>
throughout the whole area.  Incidentally, observation with<br>
a transmission electron microscope can be carried out by<br>
taking a photograph at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV<br>
using a transmission electron microscope (for example, a<br>
transmission electron microscope H-7100 FA type<br>
manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.).<br>
[0027]<br>
An amount of these heat ray shielding fine particles<br>
to be blended is preferably 0.1 to 3 parts, by weight with<br>
respect to 100 parts by weight of all adhesive resins (for<br>
example, polyvinyl acetal resin). When the amount to be<br>
blended is less than 0.1 parts by weight, an adequate<br>
effect of shielding infrared rays (heat rays) may not be<br>
exerted and the heat ray shielding property of the<br>
interlayer for laminated glass and the laminated glass to<br>
be obtained may not be adequately improved, and on the<br>
contrary when it is more than 3 parts by weight, the<br>
transparency of visible light of the interlayer for<br>
laminated glass and the laminated glass to be obtained may<br>
be deteriorated or a haze value may become larger.<br><br>
On the other hand, the above color tone compensation<br>
resin layer toned to have a color complementary to the<br>
color tone of the heat ray shielding fine particle is<br>
obtainable by dispersing coloring agents of blue color tone<br>
and red color tone, or a coloring agent of violet color<br>
tone, which has a color complementary to the color tone of<br>
yellow-green color which a resin layer formed by dispersing<br>
the above heat ray shielding fine particles in the adhesive<br>
resin has. The coloring agent for this is not particularly<br>
limited and includes, for example, phthalocyanine type blue<br>
coloring agent, indanthren type blue coloring agent and<br>
anthraquinone type blue coloring agent as a blue coloring<br>
agent, perylene type red coloring agent and anthraquinone<br>
type red coloring agent as a red coloring agent, and<br>
oxazine type violet coloring agent, anthraquinone type<br>
violet coloring agent and dichloroquinacridone type violet<br>
coloring agent as a violet coloring agent.<br>
[0029]<br>
An amount of these coloring agents, which has a color<br>
complementary to the color tone of the heat ray shielding<br>
fine particle, to be blended is preferably 0.0005 to 0.05<br>
parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of all<br>
adhesive resins. When the amount to be blended is less<br>
than 0.0005 parts by weight, an adequate effect of<br>
complementary color may not be exerted and the transparent<br>
property of the interlayer for laminated glass and the<br>
laminated glass to be obtained may not be adequately<br>
improved, and on the contrary when it is more than 0.05<br>
parts by weight, the transparency of visible light of the<br>
interlayer for laminated glass and the laminated glass to<br>
be obtained may be deteriorated or a haze value may become<br>
larger.<br>
[0030]<br>
Here, it was found that if it is pretended to add the<br><br>
coloring agent, which has a color complementary to the<br>
color tone of the heat ray shielding fine particle, to the<br>
above heat ray shielding resin layer, an oxidation-<br>
reduction reaction occurs between the coloring agent added<br>
and the heat ray shielding fine particles, and therefore<br>
the heat ray shielding resin layer is colored in yellow<br>
tone and the transparency of the laminated glass is<br>
impaired. Therefore, the heat ray shielding fine particles<br>
and the coloring agent which has a color complementary to<br>
the color tone of this heat ray shielding fine particle<br>
cannot be used together in the same layer.<br>
[0031]<br>
And so, a heat ray shielding resin layer containing<br>
the heat ray shielding fine particles and a color tone<br>
compensation resin layer toned to have a color<br>
complementary to the color tone of this heat ray shielding<br>
fine particle were separately formed and laminated, and<br>
consequently it was found that unexpectedly, thereby, it is<br>
possible to make the color tone of the interlayer for<br>
laminated glass to be obtained transparent so as to look a<br>
natural color. In this case, it is preferred that the heat<br>
ray shielding resin layer and the color tone compensation<br>
resin layer are adjacent to each other in that the<br>
realization of transparent property can be effectively<br>
achieved.<br>
[0032]<br>
The above ultraviolet absorbing resin layer can be<br>
obtained by making an adhesive resin contain an ultraviolet<br>
absorber. The ultraviolet absorber is not particularly<br>
limited and includes ultraviolet absorbers such as, malonic<br>
ester type compounds, anilide oxalate type compounds,<br>
benzotriazole type compounds, benzophenone type compounds,<br>
triazine type compounds, benzoate type compounds and<br>
hindered amine type compounds. Among others, benzotriazole<br>
type compounds such as 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-<br><br>
methylphenyDbenzotriazole (trade name "TINUVIN P" produced<br>
by CIBA-GEIGY Corporation), 2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-t-<br>
methylphenyl)benzotriazole (trade name "TINUVIN 320"<br>
produced by CIBA-GEIGY Corporation), 2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-t-<br>
butyl-5'-methylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole (trade name<br>
'TINUVIN 32 6" produced by CIBA-GEIGY Corporation) and 2-<br>
(2' -hydroxy-3' ,5' -di-amylphenyl) benzotriazole (trade name<br>
"TINUVIN 328" produced by CIBA-GEIGY Corporation) are<br>
preferred. Also, hindered amine type compounds such as<br>
trade name "ADK STAB LA-57" produced by Adeka Argus<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd. are preferred. <br>
[0033]<br>
An amount of these ultraviolet absorbers to be<br>
blended is preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by weight with respect<br>
to 100 parts by weight of all adhesive resins. When the<br>
amount to be blended is less than 0.1 parts by weight, an<br>
adequate shielding effect of absorbing ultraviolet rays may<br>
not be exerted and weather resistance and light resistance<br>
of the interlayer for laminated glass to be obtained may<br>
not be adequately improved, and on the contrary when it is<br>
more than 5 parts by weight, the transparency of visible <br>
light of the interlayer for laminated glass and the<br>
laminated glass to be obtained may be deteriorated or a<br>
haze value may become larger. <br>
[0034]<br>
Further, when the adhesive resin is a plasticized<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin, to the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer, the color tone compensation resin layer and the<br>
ultraviolet absorbing resin layer, adhesive force<br>
controlling agents such as alkali metal salts or alkaline<br>
earth metal salts of an organic acid or an inorganic acid<br>
and modified silicone oil; and antioxidants such as t-<br>
butylhydroxytoluene (trade name "Sumilizer BHT" produced by<br>
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) and tetrakis-[methylene-3-<br>
(3',5'-di-t-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane<br><br>
(trade name "Irganox 1010" produced by CIBA-GEIGY<br>
Corporation) may be added and further publicly known<br>
additives such as a light stabilizer, a surfactant, a flame<br>
retardant, an antistatic agent, a heat reflector and a heat<br>
absorbing agent may be added. <br>
[0035]<br>
Particularly, it is preferred that the antioxidant is<br>
contained at least in the heat ray shielding,resin layer,<br>
and it is more preferred that the antioxidant is contained<br>
in any resin layer of the heat ray shielding resin layer,<br>
the color tone compensation resin layer and the ultraviolet<br>
absorbing resin layer. By making the above resin layer<br>
contain the antioxidant, an oxidation reaction accompanied<br>
by coloring can be inhibited. By making any resin layer<br>
contain the antioxidant, it is easy to maintain an effect<br>
of inhibiting the oxidation reaction since even though an<br>
antioxidant in some layer is consumed, the concentration of<br>
the antioxidant is maintained by the migration of<br>
antioxidant between resin layers. <br>
[0036]<br>
Since the heat ray shielding fine particles causes<br>
the oxidation reaction accompanied by coloring due to<br>
ultraviolet rays, it is preferred to separately provide the<br>
above ultraviolet absorbing layer in order to inhibit the<br>
penetration of ultraviolet to the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer.<br>
[0037]<br>
The above ultraviolet absorbing resin layer may<br>
contain the antioxidant, but when it contains a large<br>
amount of the antioxidant together with the ultraviolet<br>
absorber, the transparency may be deteriorated with time,<br>
and therefore the ultraviolet absorber and the antioxidant<br>
are preferably contained in each layer in a small amount,<br>
respectively. Specifically, as for the proportions of the<br>
antioxidant contained in the heat ray shielding resin layer,<br><br>
the color tone compensation resin layer and the ultraviolet<br>
absorbing resin layer, respectively, the proportion of the<br>
antioxidant in the heat ray shielding resin layer is<br>
preferably 0.7 to 1 and the proportion of the antioxidant<br>
in the color tone compensation resin layer is preferably<br>
0.3 to 1 when the proportion of the antioxidant in the<br>
ultraviolet absorbing resin layer is assumed to be 1.<br>
Further, when a benzotriazole type compound and a hindered<br>
amine type compound are used in combination as an<br>
ultraviolet absorber, it is preferred to increase the<br>
amount of the antioxidant to be added because inhibiting of<br>
the oxidation reaction is especially required. By making<br>
any resin layer contain the antioxidant, it is easy to<br>
maintain an effect of inhibiting the oxidation reaction<br>
since even though an antioxidant in some layer is consumed,<br>
the concentration of the antioxidant is maintained by the<br>
migration of antioxidant between resin layers.<br>
[0038]<br>
Preferably, the overall film thickness of the<br>
interlayer for laminated glass of the present invention is<br>
generally within a range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm in practice as<br>
with the usual transparent interlayer for laminated glass<br>
in consideration of minimum requirements as laminated glass<br>
of penetration resistance and weather resistance.<br>
Preferably, the film thickness is particularly within a<br>
range of 0.7 to 1.6 mm.<br>
[0039]<br>
Particularly, when this interlayer for laminated<br>
glass is composed of the heat ray shielding resin layer,<br>
the color tone compensation resin layer and the ultraviolet<br>
absorbing resin layer, it is preferred to construct it in<br>
such a way that a thickness of the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer is 15 to 25%, a thickness of the color tone<br>
compensation resin layer is 5 to 25% and a thickness of the<br>
ultraviolet absorbing resin layer is 50 to 80% with respect<br><br>
to the overall film thickness of the interlayer. When this<br>
interlayer for laminated glass is composed of the heat ray<br>
shielding resin layer and the color tone compensation resin<br>
layer, it is preferred to construct it in such a way that a<br>
thickness of the heat ray shielding resin layer is 50 to<br>
80% and a thickness of the color tone compensation resin<br>
layer is 20 to 50% with respect to the overall film<br>
thickness of the interlayer.<br>
[0040]<br>
That is, when the color tone compensation resin layer<br>
becomes too thick, the transparency decreases. Therefore,<br>
the upper limit of the range of the thickness of the heat<br>
ray shielding resin layer which can secure the transparent<br>
property is restricted. When the color tone compensation<br>
resin layer becomes too thin, it becomes difficult to<br>
adequately compensate the color tone.  Further, when the<br>
heat ray shielding resin layer becomes too thin, a degree<br>
of yellow-green color tone is reduced to become small, but<br>
it becomes difficult to adequately secure the heat ray<br>
shielding property.<br>
[0041]<br>
Further, on the above interlayer for laminated glass<br>
formed by laminating the heat ray shielding resin layer,<br>
the color tone compensation resin layer and the ultraviolet<br>
absorbing resin layer and the above interlayer for<br>
laminated glass formed by laminating the heat ray shielding<br>
resin layer and the color tone compensation resin layer, a<br>
transparent resin layer, which has a composition similar to<br>
a usual transparent interlayer for laminated glass not<br>
containing the heat ray shielding fine particles and the<br>
coloring agent which has a color complementary to the color<br>
tone of this heat ray shielding fine particle, may be<br>
further laminated to form an interlayer.<br>
[0042]<br>
The above heat ray shielding resin layer can be<br><br>
obtained by a method in which the above adhesive resin such<br>
as polyvinyl acetal resin, the heat ray shielding fine<br>
particles, the plasticizer and various additives to be<br>
added as required are kneaded using an extruder, a<br>
plastograph, a kneader, a Banbury mixer, calendaring rolls<br>
and the like and the kneaded mixture is shaped into a film<br>
in sheet form by usual methods of forming a film such as<br>
extrusion, calendaring, pressing. The heat ray shielding<br>
resin layer can be obtained by dispersing the heat ray<br>
shielding fine particles in the plasticizer with a<br>
microbead mill and the like and then kneading a polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin with the heat ray shielding fine particle-<br>
dispersed plasticizer with a mixing roller and the like and<br>
shaping the kneaded mixture into a film in sheet form.<br>
[0043]<br>
The above color tone compensation resin layer can be<br>
obtained by a method in which the above adhesive resin such<br>
as polyvinyl acetal resin, the above coloring agent which<br>
has a color complementary to the color tone of the heat ray<br>
shielding fine particle, the plasticizer and various<br>
additives to be added as required are kneaded using an<br>
extruder, a plastograph, a kneader, a Banbury mixer,<br>
calendaring rolls and the like and the kneaded mixture is<br>
shaped into a film in sheet form by usual methods of<br>
forming a film such as extrusion, calendaring, pressing.<br>
[0044]<br>
Further, the above ultraviolet absorbing resin layer<br>
can be obtained by a method in which the above adhesive<br>
resin such as polyvinyl acetal resin, an ultraviolet<br>
absorber, the plasticizer and various additives to be added<br>
as required are kneaded using an extruder, a plastograph, a<br>
kneader, a Banbury mixer, calendaring rolls and the like<br>
and the kneaded mixture is shaped into a film in sheet form<br>
by usual methods of forming a film such as extrusion, .<br>
calendaring, pressing.<br><br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the present<br>
invention can be produced by a method of overlaying the<br>
heat ray shielding resin layer and the color tone<br>
compensation resin layer, and further the ultraviolet<br>
absorbing resin layer as required, which are separately<br>
shaped into a film as described above, and heating and<br>
pressurizing this laminate to unify these resin layers.<br>
Also, the interlayer for laminated glass of the present<br>
invention can be produced by a method of forming a unified<br>
film by a multi-layer extrusion method using compounds for<br>
forming a film of the heat ray shielding resin layer and<br>
compounds for forming a film of the color tone compensation<br>
resin layer, and further compounds for forming a film of<br>
the ultraviolet absorbing resin layer as required. As an<br>
alternative method, it can be produced by a method of<br>
forming a film concurrently with the production of<br>
laminated glass by overlaying the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer and the color tone compensation resin layer, and<br>
further the ultraviolet absorbing resin layer as required<br>
between two glass plates and heating and pressurizing this<br>
laminate to unify these resin layers.<br>
[0046]<br>
In this case, the usual transparent resin layer<br>
containing no heat ray shielding fine particles or no<br>
coloring agent which has a color complementary to the color<br>
tone of this heat ray shielding fine particle may be used<br>
in combination. When this usual transparent resin layer or<br>
the above ultraviolet absorbing resin layer is used in<br>
combination, it is preferred to laminate the heat ray<br>
shielding resin layer and the color tone compensation resin<br>
layer so as to be adjacent to each other in order to<br>
effectively attain transparent color tone of the interlayer<br>
for laminated glass to be obtained.<br><br>
The laminated glass of the present invention can be<br>
produced in the same production method as that of usual<br>
laminated glass.  For example, it can be produced by<br>
sandwiching the above-mentioned interlayer for laminated<br>
glass between at least two transparent glass plates, and<br>
then by pressing it through a press roll or by putting it<br>
in a rubber bag, bonding preliminarily at a temperature of<br>
about 70 to 110°C while deaerating air remaining between<br>
the glass plate and the interlayer by vacuum aspiration to<br>
form a laminate and then bonding this deaerated laminate<br>
formally at a temperature of about 120 to 150°C and at a<br>
pressure of about 0.98 to 1.47 MPa in an autoclave or<br>
through a press.<br>
[0048]<br>
Further, a transparent glass plate is not<br>
particularly limited and a transparent glass plate commonly<br>
used can be used. As such a glass plate, there are given,<br>
for example, various inorganic glass plates such as float<br>
plate glass, heat absorbing plate glass, polished plate<br>
glass, molded plate glass, meshed plate glass and wired<br>
plate glass; and organic glass plates such as polycarbonate<br>
plate and polymethyl methaclylate plate. These glass<br>
plates may be used alone or in combination of two or more<br>
species. Among others, heat absorbing plate glass is<br>
preferably used.  In addition, thicknesses of these glass<br>
plates may be appropriately selected depending on<br>
applications and are not particularly limited.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0049]<br>
In accordance with the present invention, infrared<br>
rays (heat rays), having a large thermal effect, of light<br>
rays entering from the laminated glass are shielded by<br>
being absorbed or reflected by the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer containing the heat ray shielding fine particles, and<br><br>
therefore a temperature rise of the interior of an<br>
automobile or of a building is inhibited and thermal<br>
malfunctions of a human body and a substance can be<br>
prevented.  In addition, though the heat ray shielding<br>
resin layer takes on the yellow-greenish color tone due to<br>
the presence of the heat ray shielding fine particles, the<br>
color tone compensation resin layer toned to have a color<br>
complementary to the color tone of the above heat ray<br>
shielding fine particles causes the yellow-greenish tone,<br>
resulting from the heat ray shielding fine particles, of<br>
the heat ray shielding resin layer to become achromatic<br>
color, and since the heat ray shielding fine particles and<br>
the coloring agent for compensating the color tone are<br>
contained in separate layers, the heat ray shielding fine<br>
particles does not contact with the coloring agent for<br>
compensating the color tone in a layer, and coloring due to<br>
a reaction of both does not occur. As a result, a state<br>
that the interlayer and the laminated glass look<br>
transparent and in natural color is continued.  Further,<br>
the interlayer having an ultraviolet absorbing resin layer<br>
prevents the discoloration of the heat ray shielding resin<br>
layer due to ultraviolet and an ultraviolet shielding<br>
property is imparted, and the fading and the discoloration<br>
of interior or fixture can be protected.<br>
[0050]<br>
Accordingly, the applications of the interlayer for<br>
laminated glass and the laminated glass of the present<br>
invention are not particularly limited, but they are<br>
suitably used for the applications, in which the heat ray<br>
shielding property and the transparent property are<br>
especially required, for example, of windshields, side<br>
glass, rear windshields and roof glass of automobiles;<br>
glass sections of vehicles such as aircrafts and electric<br>
trains, and windowpanes of buildings.<br><br>

was further added as an adhesive force controlling agent in<br>
such a way that a magnesium content is 60 ppm throughout<br>
the whole system, and the mixture was adequately melted and<br><br>
