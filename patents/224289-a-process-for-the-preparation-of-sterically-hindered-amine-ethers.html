Preparation of Stericaily Hindered Amine Ethers<br>
The invention relates to a new process for the preparation of stericaily hindered amine ethers, new compounds of this class, their use as stabilizers for organic material against degradation by light, oxygen and/or heat and corresponding compositions.<br>
A number of publications describe the stabilization of organic material using specific stericaily hindered amine (HALS) compounds as stabilizers. A valuable class of stericaily hindered amines are compounds wherein the nitrogen atom is part of a heterocyclic ring and the nitrogen atom carries an additional organic substituent linked over an oxygen atom (NOR-HALS; Kurumada et al., J.Polym.Sci, Poly.Chem. Ed. 22, 277-81 (1984); US-A-5204473); the oxygen-linked substituent is introduced in these compounds by etherification of the free oxyl-or hydroxylamine with suitable agents.<br>
Some N-allyl nitroxides rearrange under certain conditions into amine ethers (Meisenheimer rearrangement; Chem. Ber. 52,1667 (1919); Chem. Ber. 55, 513 (1922)). Cleavage of the nitroxide with formation of alkene and hydroxylamine (Cope elimination) is a competing reaction, the rate of which increases with increasing steric hindrance (J.March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, IV Ed., Wiley, 1992).<br>
Now it has been found that, surprisingly, oxidation of a 1-allyl-substituted stericaily hindered amine effectively leads to the corresponding 1-allyloxy-substituted product. The invention therefore pertains to a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
R,, Rj, R3 and R4, independently of each other, are C1-C8alkyl or C1-C5hydroxyalkyl, or RT<br>
and R2 together with the carbon atom they are attached to are C5-C12cycloalkyl, or R3 and R4<br>
together with the carbon atom they are attached to are C5-Ci2cycloalkyl;<br>
Rs, Re. R7. Ha and R9, independently of each other, are H, CrCaafkyl, C3-Caalkenyl, C5-<br>
C,2aryl, C1-C^haloalkyl, an electron withdrawing group, or Ce-C^aryl which is substituted by a<br><br>
residue selected from C1-C4alkyl, C1-C4alkoxy, halogen; and R7 and R8 together may also form a chemical bond; and<br>
R is an organic linking group containing 2-500 carbon atoms and forming, together with the carbon atoms it is directly connected to and the nitrogen atom, a substituted, 5-, 6 or 7-membered cyclic ring structure; R preferably being a C2-C50ohydrocarbon optionally containing 1 -200 hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, silicon and halogen, and,<br><br>
wherein all residues R and R^Rg are as defined for formula I, is oxidized.<br>
R7 and RB together as a chemical bond form an allenic double bond in formula I, and a triple bond in formula II.<br>
In the compounds of formula I and II and further products, Ri, Ra, R3 and R4 independently<br>
preferably are methyl or ethyl, especially methyl.<br>
Rs, Re. RT, Re and R9 as an electron withdrawing group include -CN, nitro, halogen or -<br>
COOR10 where R10 is C1-C12alkyl, C5-C12cycloalkyl, C7-C9phenylalkyl or phenyl. Preferred as<br>
electron withdrawing group are -CN or -COOR10 where R10 is Ct-C^alkyl, C5-C12cycloalkyl or<br>
phenyl, especially wherein R10 is Ct-C^alkyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
Preferably, Rs, R6, R7, Re and R9 independently are H or methyl, especially H. Also preferred<br>
are compounds wherein R5 and R6 independently are H or methyl, especially H, and R7, RB<br>
and R9 independently are haloalkyl, phenyl, vinyl, nitro, CN, COOR,0, or R7 and Re together<br>
form a chemical bond.<br>
Further preferences for the linking group R are mainly as described below for products of formulae III, IV and V.<br><br>
Of special importance is a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I by<br>
oxidation of a compound of the formula II,<br>
wherein<br>
Ri, R2l R3 and R4, independently of each other, are CrCaalkyl or C1-C5hydroxyalkyl, or Rt<br>
and R2 together with the carbon atom they are attached to are CE-C12cycloalky!, or R3 and R4<br>
together with the carbon atom they are attached to are C5-Ci2cycloalkyl;<br>
Rs, Re, R7, Re and R9, independently of each other, are H, CrCaalkyl, C3-C8alkenyl, Cs-<br>
C12aryi, an electron withdrawing group, C6-C,2aryl which is substituted by C,-C4alkyl, d-<br>
C4alkoxy, halogen; and<br>
R is a C3-C5oohydrocarbon optionally containing 1-200 hetero atoms selected from nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur and halogen, and forming, together with the two carbon and the<br>
nitrogen atom, a substituted, 6-membered cyclic ring structure.<br>
Aryl stands for a group obeying the Debye-Hueckel rule; preferred as Ce-Ci2aryl are phenyl and naphthyl.<br>

Alkanoyl is alkyl connected over a carbonyl linkage; thus, C2-C20alkanoyl includes acetyl, propionyl, butyry), hexanoyt, steaoryl.<br>
Haloalkyl is alkyl substituted by halogen, e.g. 1 or 2 halogen atoms. Halogen atoms are preferably chloro or bromo, especially bromo.<br>
Cycloalkyl is a saturated monovalent monocyclic hydrocarbon residue, e.g. cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclododecyl; preferred is cyclohexyl.<br>
Organic residues or hydrocarbons containing heteroatoms, such as alkyl or alkylene interrupted by hetero groups like oxygen or NH, usually contain these heteroatoms as typical<br><br>
functional groups like oxo, oxa, hydroxy, carboxy, ester, amino, amido, nitro, nitrilo, isocyanato, fluoro, chloro, bromo, phosphate, phosphonate, phosphite, silyl, thio, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfo, heterocyclyl including pyrrolyl, indyl, carbazolyl, furyl, benzofuryl, thiophenyl, benzothiophenyl, pyridyl, chinolyl, isochinolyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, triazolyl, benzotriazolyl, triazinyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, and corresponding saturated and/or substituted groups like, for example, piperidyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl etc., They may be interrupted by one or more of these groups; usually there are no linkages of the type O-O, 0-N (except nitro, cyanato, isocyanato, nitroso), N-N (except in heterocyclic ring structures), N-P or P-P present, regardless of the order.<br>
Preferably, in organic residues or hydrocarbons containing heteroatoms such as R there is not more than one heteroatom attached by a single bond to the same carbon atom. A spacer consisting of one or more heteroatoms usually is embedded in a carbon chain or ring or inserted into a carbon-hydrogen bond.<br>
Compounds of the formula I can be monomeric or polymeric. They contain 1 or more groups of the formula I'<br><br>
In case that the compounds of the formula I' are polymeric, they contain a group of the formula I' in the repeating structural unit.<br>
Starting compounds of the formula II are known in the art or can be obtained in analogy to known compounds. Present process can start from isolated compounds of the formula II or can use the solution of these starting compounds as obtained directly after synthesis.<br>
In the process of present invention, the oxidation reaction can be carried out using known oxidants, e.g. oxygen, peroxides or other oxidizing agents such as nitrates, permanganates, chlorates; preferred are peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide based systems, especially peracids such as perbenzoic acid or peracetic acid. The oxidant is conveniently used in<br><br>
stoiciometric amount or in excess, e.g. using 1-2 moles active oxyen atoms for each group of the formula I' in the desired product.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, for example an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, alcohol, ester, amide, ether, or halogenated hydrocarbon; examples are benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanoi, dimethylformamide, dimethylsLiffoxide, methylene chloride; preferred is a CVCaalcohol, benzene, toluene, xylene, or chlorinated C1-C6hydrocarbon.<br>
Temperature and pressure are not critical and depend mainly on the oxidant system used; preferably, temperature is kept during the reaction in the range between -20°C and +40°C. Conveniently, the pressure is kept close to atmospheric pressure, e.g. between 0-5 and 1.5 bar; when oxidation is achieved with gaseous oxygen, the pressure of oxygen or oxygen/inertgas may exceed atmospheric pressure.<br>
The process of present invention can be followed by further process steps known in the art, e.g. hydrogenation of an ethylenic double bond, halogenation, e.g. bromination, of an ethylenic double bond and/or polymerization, with or without previous isolation of the product of formula I.<br>
Hydrogenation of the ethylenic double bond (carbon-carbon double bond) in the compound of the formula I can be achieved by methods known in the art, e.g. reaction with gaseous hydrogen under catalytic conditions or reaction with hydrogenating agents. Preferred is catalytic hydrogenation; known catalysts can be employed such as Pt, Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh, on support such as carbon or without support, Raney-Ni etc.<br>
Hydrogenation of an allenic double bond in a compound of formula I wherein R7 and R8 together are a chemical bond, proceeds in 2 steps. The first step leads to a partly hydrogenated product, which may be isolated or subjected to further derivatization, and<br>
which corresponds to formula IV<br><br><br>
where R, RrR6 and Rg are as defined above for formula I and R7 and R8 are H, C1-CBalkyl, C3-C8alkenyl, C5-Ci2aryl, C,-C4haloalkyl, an electron withdrawing group, or Ce-C^aryl which is substituted by a residue selected from C1-C4alkyl, CrC^alkoxy, halogen.<br>
Haiogenation is another follow-up reaction which may be carried out subsequent to the process of present invention, mainly according to methods known in the art and using the appropriate reactant, e.g. as summarized in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reaction mechanisms and Structure, 4th Edn., Wiley, 1992, p. 812. Halogen thereby is added to the carbon-carbon double bond of a compound of formula I or IV, resulting in an a, p-dihalogenated product. The halogen reagent Xz, where X is F, CI, Br, I or preferably CI or Br, especially Br, can be applied in gaseous, liquid or solid form, pure or as a solution. Halogen can also be released during the reaction in appropriate amounts using a suitable carrier substance or source.<br>
Reactions can be carried out according to methods known in the art using hydrogen pressures in the common range, preferably between 0.5 and about 200 bar, especially between 1 and 100 bar (1 bar = 105 Pa). Reactions can be carried out using suitable solbents, e.g. water, hydrocarbons like hexane, petrol fractions, toluene, xylene, esters, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons or alcohols like methanol or ethanol. Reactions can also be carried out without solvent. Temperatures are uncritical and are mainly in the range<br><br>
between -10°C and about 150°C, e.g. between OX and the boiling point of the solvent like the range 0-100°C or 20-80°C.<br>
Present invention therefore also pertains to a process for the preparation of a cornpound of the formula V<br><br>
wherein R, RT, R2, R3 and R4, R5, R6, and R9 are as defined for formula I,<br>
R7 and R8 are H, C,-CBalkyl, C3-C8alkenyl, Cs-Ci2aryl, C,-C4haloalkyl, halogen, an electron<br>
withdrawing group, or C6-Ci2aryl which is substituted by a residue selected from C1-C4alkyl,<br>

both of Rzo and fl2i are either hydrogen or halogen; characterized in that a compound of the<br>
formula II is oxidized and the resulting intermediate of formula I is subjected to hydrogenation<br>
and/or halogenation.<br>
The above process can also be carried out in a way wherein the intermediate oi formula i is derivatized to become another structure of formula I before subjecting it to hydrogenation and/or halogenation, e.g. by esterification, dimerization, trimerization or polymerization; or wherein the intermediate of formula I is first subjected to hydrogenation, and then further derivatized, e.g. by esterification, dimerization, trimerization or polymerization.<br>
Preferred is a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula V wherein<br>
R is an organic linking group containing 2-500 carbon atoms and forming, together with the<br>
carbon atoms it is directly connected to and the nitrogen atom, a substituted, 5-, 6 or 7-<br>
membered cyclic ring structure;<br>

C4haloalkyl, an electron withdrawing group, or C6-C12aryl which is substituted by a residue<br>
selected from C1-C4alkyl, d-C^alkoxy, halogen;<br><br>
R7 and R8 are H, C,-CBalkyl, C3-C8alkenyl, C5-C12aryl, CrC4haloalkyl, halogen, an electron withdrawing group, or C6-Ci2aryl which is substituted by a residue selected from C,-C4alkyl, C,-c4alkoxy, halogen; and both of R20 and Ra! are either hydrogen or halogen.<br>
Most preferred products of the process of present invention are of formulae lllc, IVa and Va<br>
described further below.<br>
In general, all products of present process can be used as stabilizers for organic material<br>
against detrimental effects of light, oxygen and heat. Of special value are the compounds of<br>
formulae I, la, 111, IV and V. Best results are achieved with compounds of formula III wherein<br>
R, Ri, R2, R3 and R4, are as defined for formula I and<br>
R5. R6, R7, RB and R9, independently of each other, are H, d-Cealkyl, C2-Caalkeny|, CE-C,2aryl, CN, COOR10, where R,0 is as defined for formula I, or are Ce-Ci2aryl which is substituted by a residue selected from C1-C4alkyl, CrCalkoxy. Organic material most effectively stabilized by present compounds is organic polymeric material described below, e.g. coatings and thermoplastic bulk polymers, films or fibers. Where the polymers come in contact with a pesticide, e.g. a pesticide containing sulfur and/or halogen atoms, the products of present process achieve both a stabilization against light and detrimental effects of the pesticide. This is especially important for polymers, e.g. films, tapes or fibers, used in agricultural applications, mainly polyolefines such as PE or PP or polyoiefin copolymers. Preferred compounds in this application are those of formula ttl, especially lllc below.<br>
An important utility for all products of present process is the stabilization of paper and pulp, especially paper or pulp still containing Itgnin, against yellowing. Application of present products can be done as described, for example, in the international patent application No. WQ 98/04381 and the corresponding US patent application Ser. No. 09/119567, and publications cited therein. Most preferred for this application is the use of a monomeric compound of the formula III, e.g. one wherein R is C3-Ci2 alkylene, or C4-C12alkylene interrupted by O, NH, OCO or NHCO, R1-R4 are methyl or ethyl, especially methyl, and R5-R9 are each H or CrC4alkyl, especially H; examples are 1-propytoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, 1-propyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-4-one, or the product of present example 4a (see below).<br>
Further, the products of present process can be used with advantage as flame retardants for organic polymers. Thus, by using the products of present invention, an organic polymer is stabilized against detrimental effects of light, oxygen and heat, while the same time the inflammability of the polymer is effectively reduced. Application of present products can be done as described, for example, in the international patent application No. WO 98/13469 and the corresponding US patent application Ser. No. 09/104718, and publications cited therein,<br><br>

Most preferred for this utility is the use of a compound of the formula III or V, especially those of formula lllc below or of formula V wherein at least one of Rs, Re, R?, Rs- Rg, R20 or R21 is halogen, especially bromo. Present compounds can be used as flame retardants alone or in combination with known flame retardants like a flame retardant compound selected from the halogenated, phosphorus, boron, silicon and antimony compounds, metal hydroxides, metal hydrates and metal oxides or mixtures thereof.<br>

Compounds of the formulae I, III and V, especially Ifla and lllb can be employed with advantage for stabilizing organic material against the damaging effect of light, oxygen and/or heat, especially for stabilizing synthetic organic polymers or compositions containing them. They are notable for high thermal stability, substrate compatibility and good persistence in the substrate. Examples of polymers which can be stabilized in this way are the following:<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybui-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high mole¬cular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight poly¬ethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br><br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either JI- or a-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, Ha and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br><br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.	Copolymers of monoolefins and diolefins with each other or with other vinyl monomers, for example ethylene/propylene copolymers, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and mixtures thereof with low density polyethylene (LDPE), propylene/but-1-ene copolymers, propylene/isobutylene copolymers, ethylene/but-1-ene copolymers, ethylene/hexene copo¬lymers, ethylene/methylpentene copolymers, ethylene/heptene copolymers, ethylene/octene copolymers, propylene/butadiene copolymers, isobutylene/isoprene copolymers, ethy-lene/alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/alkyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl ace¬tate copolymers and their copolymers with carbon monoxide or ethylene/acrylic acid copo¬lymers and their salts (ionomers) as well as terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene; and mixtures of such copolymers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropylene/ethylene-propylene   copolymers,   LDPE/ethylene-vinyl   acetate   copolymers<br><br>
(EVA), LDPE/ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alter¬nating or random polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with other polymers, for example polyamides.<br>
4.	Hydrocarbon resins (for example C5-C9) including hydrogenated modifications thereof<br>
(e.g. tackifiers) and mixtures of polyalkylenes and starch.<br>
5.	Polystyrene, poiy(p-mefhylstyrene), pory(a-methylstyrene).<br>
6.

Of particular interest is the use of compounds of the formula Ilia as stabilizers in synthetic organic polymers, for example a coating or a bulk polymer or article formed therefrom, especially in thermoplastic polymers and corresponding compositions as well as in coating compositions. Thermoplastic polymers of most importance in present compositions are polyoiefines and their copolymers, such as listed above under items 1 -3, thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), thermoplastic polyurethan (TPU), thermoplastic rubber (TPR), polycarbonate, such as in item 19 above, and blends, such as in item 28 above. Of utmost importance are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC) and polycarbonate blends such as PC/ABS blends, as well as in acid or metal catalyzed coating compositions.<br>
In general the compounds of present invention are added to the material to be stabilized in amounts of from 0.1 to 10 %, preferably from 0.01 to 5 %, in particular from 0.01 to 2 % (based on the material to be stabilized). Particular preference is given to the use of the novel compounds in amounts of from 0.05 to 1.5 %, especially from 0.1 to 0.5 %. Where compounds of present invention are used as flame retardants, dosages are usually higher, e.g. 0.1 to 25 % by weight, mainly 0.1 to 10 % by weight of the organic material to be stabilized and protected against inflammation.<br><br>
Incorporation into the materials can be effected, for example, by mixing in or applying the compounds of the formula I, Ilia, IV, V and, if desired, further additives by the methods which are customary in the art. Where polymers are involved, especially synthetic polymers, incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as latices. A further possibility for incorporating the compounds of the formula Ilia into polymers is to add them before, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers or prior to crosslinking. In this context the compound of the formula Ilia can be added as it is or else in encapsulated form (for example in waxes, oils or polymers). In the case of addition prior to or during the polymerization, the compounds of the formula Ilia can also act as a regulator of the chain length of the polymers (chain terminator).<br>
The compounds of the formula Ilia can also be added in the form of a masterbatch containing said compound in a concentration, for example, of from 2.5 to 25 % by weight to the polymers that are to be stabilized.<br>
The compounds of the formula Ilia can judiciously be incorporated by the following methods:<br>
as emulsion or dispersion (e.g. to latices or emulsion polymers),<br>
as a dry mixture during the mixing in of additional components<br>
or polymer mixtures,<br>
by direct introduction into the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, internal<br>
mixers, etc),<br>
as solution or melt.<br>
Novel polymer compositions can be employed in various forms and/or processed to give various products, for example as (to give) films, fibres, tapes, moulding compositions, profiles, or as binders for coating materials, adhesives or putties.<br><br>
In addition to the compounds of the formula Ilia the novel compositions may as additional component C comprise one or more conventional additives such as, for example, those indicated below.<br>

The conventional additives are judiciously employed in amounts of 0.1-10 % by weight, for example 0.2-5 % by weight, based on the material to be stabilized.<br>
Costabilizers optionally to be added to the stabilizer mixture of the invention are preferably further light stabilizers, for instance those of the 2-hydroxyphenyl-benztriazole, 2-hydroxyphenyl-triazine, benzophenone or oxalanilide classes, e.g. as described in EP-A-453396, EP-A-434608, US-A-5298067, WO 94/18278, GB-A-2297091 and WO 96/28431, and/or further hindered amines derived from 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine containing at least one group of the formula<br><br><br>
in which G is hydrogen or methyl, especially hydrogen; examples of tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives which can be used as costabilizers with mixtures of the invention are given in EP-A-356 677, pages 3-17, sections a) to f). These sections of this EP-A are regarded as part of the present description.<br>
Likewise of particular interest is the use of the novel mixtures comprising compounds of the formula Ilia as stabilizers for coatings, for example for paints. The invention therefore also relates to those compositions whose component (A) is a film-forming binder for coatings.<br>
The novel coating composition preferably comprises 0.01 -10 parts by weight of (B), in particular 0.05 -10 parts by weight of (B), especially 0.1 -5 parts by weight of (B), per 100 parts by weight of solid binder (A).<br>
Multilayer systems are possible here as well, where the concentration of the novel stabilizer (component (B)) in the outer layer can be relatively high, for example from 1 to 15 parts by weight of (B), in particular 3-10 parts by weight of (B), per 100 parts by weight of solid binder (A).<br>
The use of the novel stabilizer in coatings is accompanied by the additional advantage that it prevents delamination, i.e. the flaking-off of the coating from the substrate. This advantage is particularly important in the case of metallic substrates, including multilayer systems on metallic substrates.<br>
The binder (component (A)) can in principle be any binder which is customary in industry, for example those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991. In general, it is a film-forming binder based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Component (A) can be a cold-curable or hot-curable binder; the addition of a curing catalyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts which accelerate curing of the binder are described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, p.469, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1991.<br>
Preference is given to coating compositions in which component (A) is a binder comprising a functional acrylate resin and a crosslinking agent.<br>
Examples of coating compositions containing specific binders are:<br>
1.	paints based on cold- or hot-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, if desired with addition of a curing catalyst;<br>
2.	two-component polyurethane paints based on hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
3.	one-component polyurethane paints based on blocked isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates which are deblocked during baking, if desired with addition of a melamine resin;<br>
4.	one-component polyurethane paints based on a Trisalkoxycarbonyltriazine crosslinker and a hydroxyl group containing resin such as acrylate, polyester or polyether resins;<br>
5.	one-component polyurethane paints based on aliphatic or aromatic urethaneacrylates or polyurethaneacrylates having free amino groups within the urethane strukture and melamine resins or polyether resins, if necessary with curing catalyst;<br>
6.	two-component paints based on (poly)ketimines and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

8.	two-component paints based on carboxyl- or amino-containing polyacrylates and polyepoxides;<br>
9.	two-component paints based on acrylate resins containing anhydride groups and on a polyhydroxy or polyamino component;<br>
10.	two-component paints based on acrylate-containing anhydrides and polyepoxides;<br><br>
11.	two-component paints based on (poly)oxazolines and acrylate resins containing anhydride groups, or unsaturated acrylate resins, or aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
12.	two-component paints based on unsaturated polyacrylates and polymalonates;<br>
13.	thermoplastic polyacrylate paints based on thermoplastic acrylate resins or externally crosslinking acrylate resins in combination with etherified melamine resins;<br>
14.	paint systems based on siloxane-modified or fluorine-modified acrylate resins.<br>
In addition to components (A) and (B), the coating composition according to the invention preferably comprises as component (C) a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type, the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and/or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotria£ole type, for example as mentioned in the above list in sections 2.1, 2.6 and 2.8. Further examples for light stabilizers of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine type advantageously to be added can be found e.g. in the publications US-A-4619956, EP-A-434608, US-A-5198498, US-A-5322868, US-A-5369140, US-A-5298067, WO-94/18278, EP-A-704437, GB-A-2297091, WO-96/28431. Of special technical interest is the addition of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazines and/or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazoles, especially the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazines.<br>
Component (C) is preferably used in an amount of 0.05 - 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the solid binder.<br>
Apart from components (A), (B) and, if used, (C), the coating composition can also comprise further components, examples being solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, stabilizers, thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or levelling agents. Examples of possible components are those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471, VCH, Weinheim 1991.<br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, organo metal lie compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic compounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metals Al, Ti or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as<br>
organotin compounds, for example.<br><br>
Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates, resinates or tallates.<br>
Examples of metal chelates are the aluminium, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetylacetone, ethyl acetylacetate, salicyialdehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenone or ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate, and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin<br>
dioctoate.<br>
Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example tri methyl benzyl ammonium chloride.<br>
Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the binder essentially comprises monomeric or oligomeric compounds containing ethylenically unsaturated bonds, which after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e. converted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains a photo initiator as well. Corresponding systems are described in the abovementioned publication Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coating compositions, the novel stabilizers can also be employed without the addition of sterically hindered amines.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any desired substrates, tor example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. They are preferably used as topcoat in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br><br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary methods, for example by brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings or coil coatings even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a coating, in particular a paint, which has been stabilized against the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by a content of the compound of the formula F according to the invention. The paint is preferably a topcoat for automobiles. The invention furthermore relates to a process for stabilizing a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a mixture comprising a compound of the formula F, and to the use of mixtures comprising a compound of the formula F in coating compositions as stabilizers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat.<br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution or dispersion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and water. The coating composition may be a high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating material). Powder coatings are, for example, those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., A18, pages 438-444. The additive of present invention can be used therein e.g. as described e.g. in EP-A-856563, especially page 22, tine 21, until page 26, line 29, and literature cited in this reference.The powder coating material may also have the form of a powder-slurry {dispersion of the powder preferably in water).<br>

1.	Carboxy- or hydroxy-functionalised polyester resins, based on monomers such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, neopentyl glycol, 2-methyl-1,3-propandiol, trjs-1,1,1-(hydroxymethyl) propane etc.<br>

and ethers of glycidol (such as Araldit® PT910 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals).<br>
2)	p-hydroxyalkylamides, such as Primid® types XL552 and QM1260 from Ems Chemie.<br>
3)	derivatives of melamine, benzoguanimine and glycoluril, such as Powderlink® 1174 from<br>
American Cyanamid.<br>
Crosslinking agents for resins of hydroxy functionality include anhydrides and especially blocked diisocyanates and uretdiones, etc.<br>
Powder coatings based on resins with epoxy functionality are typically used together with crosslinking agents such as diacids (such as 1,12-dodecanedioic acid), carboxy-fu notional polyesters, carboxy-functional copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, anhydrides (such as the anhydride prepared from 1,12-dodecanedioic acid).<br>
Other additives that can be used together with the compounds of the invention in powder coatings include: degassing agents, flow promoters, tribocharging additives cure catalysts, sensitisers, cationic and free-radical photoinitiators, as well as typical liquid paint additives.<br>
A particular advantage of the compounds of the invention is their low basicity, as basic compounds often catalyse the crosslinking reactions of powder coatings to cause poor flow and degassing, and reduced storage stability. This is particularly useful in formulations of<br><br>
high reactivity, such as the glycidylmethacrylate-functionalised acrylics. Here, the combination of the compounds of the invention together with uv-absorbers, especially of the hydroxyphenyltriazine class, can be used to improve the weatherability without causing catalysis. In other binder systems and with other classes of uv-absorbers, such as those previously mentioned to be of particular use in automotive paints, synergistic effects on the weatherability are also found.<br>
In powder coatings the compounds of the invention can also be used to improve the oxidative stability and reduce yellowing on curing and overbaking. Here not only is the low basicity advantageous, but also the ability of the hindered morpholinones to withstand and prevent yellowing caused by oxides of nitrogen in gas-fired ovens. Use together particularly with phosphite and phosphonite costabilisers, as disclosed in EP-A-816442, and dialkylesters of dithiopropionic acid is particularly beneficial. The compounds of the invention can, where appropriate also be used to stabilise polyester during manufacture as well as at all stages of its subsequent use.<br>
The pigments can be inorganic, organic or metallic pigments. The novel coating compositions preferably contain no pigments and are used as a clearcoat.<br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
