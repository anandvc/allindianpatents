				<td>ELASTOMER NANOCOMPOSITES COMPRISING<br>
ISOBUTYLENE AND MULTIFUNCTIONAL OLIGOMERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to low-permeability nanocomposites useful for<br>
air barriers, processes to produce the same, and their use in articles of<br>
manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles<br>
with at least one dimension in the nanometer range. Some examples of these are<br>
disclosed in US 6,060,549, 6,103,817, 6,034,164, 5,973,053, 5,936,023,<br>
5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372. Common types of<br>
inorganic particles used in nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic<br>
substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays." Ideally,<br>
intercalation should take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts<br>
into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces. Ultimately, it is desirable to<br>
have exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed with the individual<br>
nanometer-size clay platelets. Due to the general enhancement in air barrier<br>
qualities of various polymer blends when clays are present, there is a desire for a<br>
nanocomposite with low air permeability; especially a dynamically vulcanized<br>
elastomer nanocomposite such as used in the manufacture of tires.<br>
[0003] The preparation of nanocomposites uses a number of methods to<br>
generate exfoliated clays. One of the most common methods relies upon the use<br>
of organically modified montmorillonite clays. Organoclays are typically<br>
produced through solution based ion-exchange reactions that replace sodium ions<br>
that exist on the surface of sodium montmorillonite with organic molecules such<br>
as alkyl or aryl ammonium compounds and typically known in the industry as<br>
swelling or exfoliating agents. See, e.g., US 5,807,629, WO 02/100935, and WO<br>
02/100936. Other background references include US 5,576,373, 5,665,183,<br>
5,807,629, 5,936,023, 6,121,361, WO 94/22680, WO 01/85831, and WO<br>
04/058874.<br>
 [0004] One method to improve the organoclay performance is to use<br>
functionalized polymers to treat the clay. This approach uses materials that are<br>
soluble in water or materials that can be incorporated into the polymerization<br>
reaction. This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using for<br>
example, oligomeric and monomeric caprolactam as the modifier. Polyolefin<br>
nanocomposites, such as polypropylene nanocomposites, have utilized maleic<br>
anhydride grafted polypropylenes to achieve some success in the formation of<br>
nanocomposites.<br>
[0005] For example, it is known to utilize exfoliated-clay filled nylon as a<br>
high impact plastic matrix, such as disclosed in US 6,060,549 to Li et al. In<br>
particular, Li et al. disclose a blend of a thermoplastic resin such as nylon; a<br>
copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin, a para-methylstyrene and a para-<br>
(halomethylstyrene); and exfoliated clays that are used as a high impact material.<br>
Further, Japanese Unexamined Application P2000-160024 to Yuichi et al.<br>
discloses a thermoplastic elastomer composition which can be used as an air<br>
barrier, including a blend similar to that disclosed in Li et al.<br>
[0006] Elastomeric nanocomposite innerliners and innertubes have also been<br>
formed using a complexing agent and a rubber, where the agent is a reactive<br>
rubber having positively charged groups and a layered silicate uniformly dispersed<br>
therein. See, for example, Kresge et al. US 5,665,183 and 5,576,373. This<br>
approach uses pre-formed positively charged reactive rubber components.<br>
[0007] Nanocomposites have also been formed using non-ionic, brominated<br>
copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene, and blends of these<br>
copolymers with other polymers. See, for example, Elspass et al., US 5,807,629,<br>
and US 6,034,164.<br>
[0008]	As described above, these nanocomposites are made by mixing of<br>
elastomers and organoclays either at melt state or in solution; and, due to the<br>
hydrophobic nature of the polymer, the organoclays are typically modified to<br>
provide better interaction between the clays and the polymers. The modification<br>
process typically involves exchange of Na+ cations in the inorganic clay with<br>
organic modifiers such as tetra alkyl ammonium salts. The process is expensive<br>
and most modified clays are not exfoliated in polymers or in organic solvent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present invention provides a less costly, more efficient method to<br>
manufacture polymer-clay nanocomposites. The invention also provides a<br>
polymer-clay nanocomposite that can include an elastomer; a polymer or oligomer<br>
functionalized with a polar group; and a clay. By blending the functionalized<br>
polymer/oligomer with the elastomer and/or clay, the dispersion of the clay in the<br>
elastomer can be enhanced without specific functionalization of the elastomer for<br>
clay dispersion, and barrier properties of the resulting blend are similar to<br>
blending the clay with polar functionalized elastomer.<br>
[00101 The elastomer can be a halogenated elastomer, such as a halogenated<br>
polyisobutylene for example, or a halogenated copolymer of isobutylene and para-<br>
methylstyrene as another example. The elastomer can be halogenated with<br>
bromine or chlorine. The halogenated elastomer can have functional groups, such<br>
as halides, ethers, amines, amides, esters, acids, and hydroxyls. In one<br>
embodiment, the elastomer is essentially free of polar functionalization, or in<br>
another embodiment, the halogenated elastomer is essentially free of polar<br>
functionalization other than the halogenation. In another embodiment, the<br>
elastomer or halogenated elastomer is less functionalized than the functionalized<br>
polymer or oligomer.<br>
[0011] The elastomer can include a polymer chain E comprising an<br>
ammonium-functionalized group. The ammonium functionalized group can be<br>
described by the following group pendant to the polymer chain E:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br>
wherein R and R1 are the same or different and are one of a hydrogen, C1<br>
to C7 alkyls, and primary or secondary alkyl halides; and wherein R2, R3 and R4<br>
are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes<br><br>
or aryls, substituted C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, C1 to C20 aliphatic alcohols<br>
or ethers, C1 to C20 carboxylic acids, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters<br>
and ammonium ions.<br>
[0012] The polymer or oligomer can be functionalized with between 0.01 and<br>
10 weight percent of a polar group in one embodiment; 0.01 weight percent to 10<br>
weight percent of the polymer in one embodiment, and from 0.1 weight percent to<br>
8 weight percent in another embodiment, from 0.2 to 7 weight percent in yet<br>
another embodiment, from 0.2 - 5.0 weight percent in another embodiment, from<br>
0.3 - 3.0 weight percent in another embodiment, and from 0.5 to 2.0 weight<br>
percent in another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may be any<br>
combination of any upper weight percent limit with any lower weight percent<br>
limit. The polymer or oligomer functionalized with a polar group can be a<br>
polymer or oligomer of a C4 - C8 isoolefin. The isoolefin can be isobutylene. The<br>
polymer or oligomer can be an interpolymer of a C4 - C7 isoolefin and an<br>
alkylstyrene. The polymer or oligomer can be halogenated with bromine or<br>
chlorine.<br>
[0013] The polar group can be selected from alcohols, ethers, acids,<br>
anhydrides, nitriles, amines including ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters,<br>
ammonium ions, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0014] The polar group can be derived from an acid anhydride, such as a<br>
cyclic anhydride, a symmetric anhydride, a mixed anhydride, or combinations<br>
thereof. The acid anhydride can be a carboxylic anhydride, a thioanhydride, a<br>
phosphoric anhydride, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0015] In one embodiment, the acid anhydride is a carboxylic acid anhydride.<br>
In certain embodiments, the carboxylic acid anhydride is maleic anhydride,<br>
succinic anhydride, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0016]	In one embodiment, the polar group is derived from an acid. The acid<br>
can be a carboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, a tricarboxylic acid, an oxo<br>
carboxylic acid, a peroxy acid, a thiocarboxylic acid, a sulfonic acid, a sulfinic<br>
acid, a xanthic acid, sulfenic acid, sulfamic acid, a phosphonic acid, an amic acid,<br>
an azinic acid, an azonic acid, a hydroxamic acid, an imidic acid, an imino acid, a<br>
nitrosolic acid, a nitrolic acid, a hydrazonic acid, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[0017] In certain embodiments, the elastomer can have a number average<br>
molecular weight between 25000 and 500000; between 50000 and 250000 in<br>
other embodiments; greater than 50000 in yet other embodiments. In certain<br>
embodiments, the polar polymer or oligomer can have a number average<br>
molecular weight between 500 and 100000; less than 25000 in other<br>
embodiments; greater than 50000 in other embodiments. In certain embodiments,<br>
the elastomer has a number average molecular weight of at least 100000 and the<br>
polar polymer has a molecular weight less than 100000; in other embodiments, the<br>
elastomer and polar polymer can have any combination of number average<br>
molecular weights, the same or different.<br>
[0018] In certain embodiments, the elastomer can be halogenated and the<br>
polar group can be derived from an acid or an acid anhydride. In other<br>
embodiments, the elastomer can be halogenated and partially functionalized with<br>
an amine and the polar group can be derived from alcohols, ethers, acids,<br>
anhydrides, nitriles, acrylates, esters, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0019] In certain embodiments of the nanocomposite, the weight ratio of polar<br>
functionalized polymer/oligomer to elastomer can be between 0.01:1 and 1:1. In<br>
other embodiments, the weight ratio of polar functionalized polymer/oligomer to<br>
elastomer can be between 0.05:1 and 0.5:1; between 0.1:1 and 0.25:1; or between<br>
any combination of ratios in other embodiments.<br>
[0020] The nanocomposite includes clay, which can be an inorganic clay, an<br>
organoclay, or mixtures thereof. The clay can be a silicate. The clay can be a<br>
smectite clay, such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, bentonite,<br>
volkonskoite, laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite,<br>
stevensite, vermiculite, halloysite, hydrotalcite, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0021] The nanocomposite can include fillers such as calcium carbonate,<br>
mica, silica, silicates (for purposes of use as a filler, not clay), talc, titanium<br>
dioxide, carbon black, or mixtures thereof. The nanocomposite can incorporate<br>
additives including dye, pigment, antioxidant, heat and light stabilizer, plasticizer,<br>
oil, or mixtures thereof. The nanocomposite can also incorporate curatives<br>
including organic peroxide, zinc oxide, zinc stearate, stearic acid, an accelerator, a<br>
vulcanizing agent, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[0022]        The present invention also provides a method to form a nanocomposite<br>
comprising combining a halogenated elastomer, a clay, and a polymer or oligomer<br>
functionalized with a polar group, each as described above.<br>
[0023]        The present invention also provides for the improvement of a process<br>
to   manufacture   a  nanocomposite   comprising   elastomer   and   a   clay,   the<br>
improvement comprising introducing a polymer or oligomer functionalized with a<br>
polar group to the elastomer-clay mixture.<br>

Definitions<br>
[0025]        As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table<br>
Groups is used as set forth in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27<br>
(1985).<br>
[0026]        As used herein, "polymer" may be used to refer to homopolymers,<br>
copolymers, interpolymers, terpolymers, etc. Likewise, a copolymer may refer to<br>
a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0027]        As used herein, when a polymer is referred to as comprising a<br>
monomer, the monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the<br>
monomer or in the derivative form the monomer.    Likewise, when catalyst<br>
components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it<br>
is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the ionic form of the component is<br>
the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0028]        As used herein, "elastomer" or "elastomeric composition" refers to any<br>
polymer or composition of polymers (such as blends of polymers) consistent with<br>
the ASTM D1566 definition. Elastomer includes mixed blends of polymers such<br>
as melt mixing and/or reactor blends of polymers.    The terms may be used<br>
interchangeably with the term "rubber."<br><br>
[0029]        As used herein, "phr" is 'parts per hundred rubber' and is a measure<br>
common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to<br>
a major elastomer component, based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer(s)<br>
or rubber(s).<br>
[0030]        As used herein, "isobutylene based elastomer" or "isobutylene based<br>
polymer" refers to elastomers or polymers comprising at least 70 mole percent<br>
repeat units from isobutylene.<br>
[0031]        As used herein, "isoolefin" refers to any olefin monomer having at<br>
least one carbon having two substitutions on that carbon.<br>
[0032]        As used herein, "multiolefin" refers to any monomer having two or<br>
more double bonds, for example, a multiolefin may be any monomer comprising<br>
two conjugated double bonds such as a conjugated diene such as isoprene.<br>
[0033]        As used herein, "nanocomposite" or "nanocomposite composition"<br>
refers to polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one<br>
dimension in the nanometer range within a polymer matrix.<br>
[0034]        As used herein, "intercalation" refers to the state of a composition in<br>
which a polymer is present between each layer of a platelet filler.    As is<br>
recognized in the industry and by academia, some indicia of intercalation can be<br>
the shifting and/or weakening of detection of X-ray lines as compared to that of<br>
original platelet fillers, indicating a larger spacing between vermiculite layers than<br>
in the original mineral.<br>
[0035]        As used herein, "exfoliation" refers to the separation of individual<br>
layers of the original inorganic particle, so that polymer can surround or surrounds<br>
each particle.   In an embodiment, sufficient polymer is present between each<br>
platelet such that the platelets are randomly spaced. For example, some indication<br>
of exfoliation or intercalation may be a plot showing no X-ray lines or larger d-<br>
spacing because of the random spacing or increased separation of layered<br>
platelets. However, as recognized in the industry and by academia, other indicia<br>
may be useful to indicate the results of exfoliation such as permeability testing,<br>
electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, etc.<br>
[0036]        As used herein, "solvent" refers to any substance capable of dissolving<br>
another substance.   When the term solvent is used it may refer to at least one<br><br>
solvent or two or more solvents unless specified. In certain embodiments, the<br>
solvent is polar; in other embodiments, the solvent is non-polar.<br>
(0037] As used herein, "solution" refers to a uniformly dispersed mixture at<br>
the molecular level or ionic level, of one or more substances (solute) in one or<br>
more substances (solvent). For example, solution process refers to a mixing<br>
process that both the elastomer and the modified layered filler remain in the same<br>
organic solvent or solvent mixtures.<br>
[0038]        As used herein, "suspension" refers to a system consisting of a solid<br>
dispersed in a solid, liquid, or gas usually in particles of larger than colloidal size.<br>
[0039]        As used herein, "emulsion" refers to a system consisting of a liquid or<br>
liquid suspension dispersed with or without an emulsifier in an immiscible liquid<br>
usually in droplets of larger than colloidal size.<br>
[0040] As used herein, "hydrocarbon" refers to molecules or segments of<br>
molecules containing primarily hydrogen and carbon atoms. In some<br>
embodiments, hydrocarbon also includes halogenated versions of hydrocarbons<br>
and versions containing heteroatoms as discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0041] As used herein, "polar group" refers to a group of atoms with<br>
asymmetrically arranged polar bonds in which the difference in electronegativity<br>
of bonding atoms, using the Linus Pauling scale of electronegativities, is greater<br>
than 0.3 and less than 1.7. In contrast to ionic groups in which there is charge<br>
separation to facilitate cation exchange with the cations between clay layers, there<br>
is generally no charge separation in polar groups. Polar groups can interact with<br>
clay surfaces, but serve as dispersion aids and not generally as intercalates.<br>
Elastomer<br>
[0042] The nanocomposite of the present invention includes at least one<br>
elastomer comprising C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units. The elastomer can be<br>
halogenated. The isoolefin may be a C4 to C7 compound, in one embodiment<br>
selected from isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3 -methyl- 1-butene, 2-<br>
methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The elastomer may also include other<br>
monomer derived units. In one embodiment, the elastomer includes at least one<br>
styrenic monomer, which may be any substituted styrene monomer unit, and<br>
desirably is selected from styrene, a-methylstyrene or an alkylstyrene (ortho,<br><br>
meta, or para), the alkyl selected from any C1 to C5 alkyl or branched chain alkyl.<br>
In a desirable embodiment, the styrenic monomer is p-methylstyrene. In another<br>
embodiment, the elastomer includes at least one multiolefin, which may be a C4 to<br>
C14 diene, conjugated or not, in one embodiment selected from isoprene,<br>
butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene,<br>
cyclopentadiene, methylcyclopentadiene, piperylene and combinations thereof.<br>
[0043] In one embodiment, the elastomer includes an isoolefin derived unit, a<br>
multiolefin derived unit, and a styrenic derived unit. In another embodiment, the<br>
elastomer includes an isoolefin derived unit and a styrenic derived unit, and in yet<br>
another embodiment the elastomer includes an isoolefin derived unit and a<br>
multiolefin derived unit.<br>
[0044] The elastomers in one embodiment of the invention are random<br>
elastomeric copolymers of a C4 to C7 isoolefin, such as isobutylene and a para-<br>
alkylstyrene comonomer, preferably para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%,<br>
more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and also include<br>
functionalized interpolymers wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents<br>
groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some<br>
other functional group. In another embodiment of the invention, the interpolymer<br>
is a random elastomeric copolymer of ethylene or a C3 to C6 α-olefin and a para-<br>
alkylstyrene comonomer, preferably para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%,<br>
more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and also include<br>
functionalized interpolymers wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents<br>

other functional group. Preferred materials may be characterized as interpolymers<br>
containing the following monomer units randomly spaced along the polymer<br>
chain:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br><br>
wherein R10 and R11 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, preferably C1 to C7<br>
alkyl and primary or secondary alkyl halides and X is a functional group such as<br>
halogen. Preferably R10 and R11 are hydrogen. Up to 60 mole percent of the para-<br>
substituted styrene present in the interpolymer structure may be the functionalized<br>
structure above in one embodiment, and in another embodiment from 0.1 to 5<br>
mole percent. In yet another embodiment, the amount of functionalized structure<br>
is from 0.4 to 1 mole percent.<br>
[0045] The functional group X may be halogen or a combination of a halogen<br>
and some other functional group such which may be incorporated by nucleophilic<br>
substitution of benzylic halogen with other groups such as carboxylic acids;<br>
carboxy salts; carboxy esters, amides and imides; hydroxy; alkoxide; phenoxide;<br>
thiolate; thioether; xanthate; cyanide; nitrile; amino and mixtures thereof. These<br>
functionalized isoolefin copolymers, their method of preparation, methods of<br>
functionalization, and cure are more particularly disclosed in US 5,162,445, and in<br>
particular, the functionalized amines as described below.<br>
[0046] Most useful of such functionalized materials are elastomeric random<br>
interpolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene containing from 0.5 to 20<br>
mole percent para-methylstyrene, wherein up to 60 mole percent of the methyl<br>
substituent groups present on the benzyl ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom,<br>
preferably a bromine atom (para(bromomethylstyrene)), as well as a combination<br>
of para(bromomethylstyrene) and other functional groups such as ester and ether.<br>
These halogenated elastomers are commercially available as EXXPRO™<br>
Elastomers (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston TX), and abbreviated as<br>
"BIMS".<br>
[0047] In a preferred embodiment, the functionality is selected such that it can<br>
react or form polar bonds with functional groups present in the matrix polymer,<br>
for example, acid, amino or hydroxyl functional groups, when the polymer<br>
components are mixed at high temperatures.<br>
[0048] These functionalized interpolymers have a substantially homogeneous<br>
compositional distribution such that at least 95% by weight of the polymer has a<br>
para-alkylstyrene content within 10% of the average para-alkylstyrene content of<br>
the polymer. Desirable interpolymers are also characterized by a narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 5, more preferably less than<br>
2.5, a preferred viscosity average molecular weight in the range of from 200,000<br>
up to 2,000,000 and a preferred number average molecular weight in the range of<br>
from 25,000 to 750,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
[0049] The BIMS polymers may be prepared by a slurry polymerization of the<br>
monomer mixture using a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by halogenation,<br>
preferably bromination, in solution in the presence of halogen and a radical<br>
initiator such as heat and/or light and/or a chemical initiator and, optionally,<br>
followed by electrophilic substitution of bromine with a different functional<br>
moiety.<br>
[0050] Preferred BIMS polymers are brominated polymers that generally<br>
contain from 0.1 to 5 mole percent of bromomethylstyrene groups relative to the<br>
total amount of monomer derived units in the polymer. In another embodiment,<br>
the amount of bromomethyl groups is from 0.2 to 3.0 mole percent, and from 0.3<br>
to 2.8 mole percent in yet another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.5 mole percent<br>
in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 2.0 in yet another embodiment,<br>
wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper limit with any<br>
lower limit. Expressed another way, preferred copolymers contain from 0.2 to 10<br>
weight percent of bromine, based on the weight of the polymer, from 0.4 to 6<br>
weight percent bromine in another embodiment, and from 0.6 to 5.6 weight<br>
percent in another embodiment, are substantially free of ring halogen or halogen<br><br>
in the polymer backbone chain. In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
interpolymer is a copolymer of C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units (or<br>
isomonoolefm), para-methylstyrene derived units and para-(halomethylstyrene)<br>
derived units, wherein the para-(halomethylstyrene) units are present in the<br>
interpolymer from 0.4 to 3.0 mole percent based on the total number of para-<br>
methylstyrene, and wherein the para-methylstyrene derived units are present from<br>
3 weight percent to 15 weight percent based on the total weight of the polymer in<br>
one embodiment, and from 4 weight percent to 10 weight percent in another<br>
embodiment. In another embodiment, the para-(halomethylstyrene) is para-<br>
(bromomethylstyrene).<br>
[0051] The halogenated elastomer useful in the present invention may also<br>
include a halogenated butyl rubber component. As used herein, "halogenated butyl<br>
rubber" refers to both butyl rubber and so-called "star-branched" butyl rubber,<br>
described below. In one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated rubber<br>
component is a halogenated copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin and a multiolefin.<br>
In another embodiment, the halogenated rubber component is a blend of a<br>
polydiene or block copolymer, and a copolymer of a C4 to C7 isoolefin and a<br>
conjugated, or a "star-branched" butyl polymer. The halogenated butyl polymer<br>
useful in the present invention can thus be described as a halogenated elastomer<br>
comprising C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units, multiolefin derived units, and<br>
halogenated multiolefin derived units, and includes both "halogenated butyl<br>
rubber" and so called "halogenated star-branched" butyl rubber.<br>
[0052] In one embodiment, the halogenated butyl rubber is brominated butyl<br>
rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties<br>
and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in THE VANDERBILT<br>
RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc.<br>
1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp;<br>
Hall 1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl<br>
rubbers are described by Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8 KIRK-OTHMER<br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.<br>
4th ed. 1993).<br><br>
[0053] The halogenated rubber component of the present invention includes,<br>
but is not limited to, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-<br>
branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl<br>
(polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; isobutylene-bromomethylstyrene<br>
copolymers such as isobutylene/meta-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/para-<br>
bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/chloromethylstyrene, halogenated isobutylene<br>
cyclopentadiene, and isobutylene/para-chloromethylstyrene, and the like<br>
halomethylated aromatic interpolymers as in US 4,074,035 and US 4,395,506;<br>
isoprene and halogenated isobutylene copolymers, polychloroprene, and the like,<br>
and mixtures of any of the above. Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber<br>
component are also described in US 4,703,091 and US 4,632,963.<br>
[0054] More particularly, in one embodiment of the brominated rubber<br>
component of the invention, a halogenated butyl rubber is used. The halogenated<br>
butyl rubber is produced from the halogenation of butyl rubber. Preferably, the<br>
olefin polymerization feeds employed in producing the halogenated butyl rubber<br>
of the invention are those olefinic compounds conventionally used in the<br>
preparation of butyl-type rubber polymers. The butyl polymers are prepared by<br>
reacting a comonomer mixture, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C7 isoolefin<br>
monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, or conjugated<br>
diene, monomer component. The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 weight<br>
percent by weight of the total comonomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to<br>
99.5 weight percent in another embodiment. The conjugated diene component in<br>
one embodiment is present in the comonomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 weight<br>
percent in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 weight percent in another<br>
embodiment. In yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 weight percent of the<br>
comonomer mixture is conjugated diene.<br>
[0055] The isoolefin is a C4 to C7 compound such as isobutylene, isobutene 2-<br>
methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene.<br>
The multiolefin is a C4 to C14 conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-<br>
dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, cyclopentadiene,<br>
hexadiene and piperylene. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the<br>
invention is obtained by reacting 92 to 99.5 weight percent of isobutylene with 0.5<br><br>
to 8 weight percent isoprene, or reacting 95 to 99.5 weight percent isobutylene<br>
with from 0.5 to 5.0 weight percent isoprene in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0056] Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl<br>
rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means,<br>
and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process. Methods of<br>
halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in US 2,631,984,<br>
3,099,644, 4,554,326, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901.<br>
In one embodiment, the halogen is in the so called II and III structures as<br>
discussed in, for example, RUBBER TECHNOLOGY at 298-299 (1995). In one<br>
embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 40 to 60°C<br>
using bromine (Br2) or chlorine (C12) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated<br>
butyl rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) in one<br>
embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment. The halogen content is<br>
from 0.1 to 10 weight percent based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl<br>
rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 5 weight percent in another<br>
embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the halogen weight percent of the<br>
halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.2 weight percent.<br>
[0057] In another embodiment, the halogenated butyl or star-branched butyl<br>
rubber may be halogenated such that the halogenation is primarily allylic in<br>
nature. This is typically achieved by such means as free radical bromination or<br>
free radical chlorination, or by such methods as secondary treatment of<br>
electrophilically halogenated rubbers, such as by heating the rubber, to form the<br>
allylic halogenated butyl and star-branched butyl rubber. Common methods of<br>
forming the allylic halogenated polymer are disclosed by Gardner et al. in US<br>
4,632,963; US 4,649,178; US 4,703,091. Thus, in one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the halogenated butyl rubber is such that the halogenated multiolefin<br>
units are primary allylic halogenated units, and wherein the primary allylic<br>
configuration is present to at least 20 mole percent (relative to the total amount of<br>
halogenated multiolefin) in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole percent in<br>
another embodiment. This arrangement can be described by the structure:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br><br>
wherein X is a halogen, desirably chlorine or bromine, and q is at least 20 mole<br>
percent based on the total moles of halogen in one embodiment, and at least 30<br>
mole percent in another embodiment, and from 25 mole percent to 90 mole<br>
percent in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0058] A commercial embodiment of the halogenated butyl rubber of the present<br>
invention is Bromobutyl 2222 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company). Its Mooney<br>
Viscosity is from 27 to 37 (ML 1+8 at 125°C, ASTM 1646, modified), and the<br>
bromine content is from 1.8 to 2.2 weight percent. Another commercial<br>
embodiment of the halogenated butyl rubber is Bromobutyl 2255 (ExxonMobil<br>
Chemical Company). Its Mooney Viscosity is from 41 to 51 (ML 1+8 at 125°C,<br>
ASTM 1646, modified), and the bromine content is from 1.8 to 2.2 weight<br>
percent. The invention is not limited to the commercial source of any of the<br>
halogenated rubber components.<br>
[0059] In another embodiment of the brominated rubber component of the<br>
invention, a branched or "star-branched" halogenated butyl rubber is used. In one<br>
embodiment, the star-branched halogenated butyl rubber ("SBHR") is a<br>
composition of a butyl rubber, either halogenated or not, and a polydiene or block<br>
copolymer, either halogenated or not. The halogenation process is described in<br>
detail in US 4,074,035, 5,071,913, 5,286,804, 5,182,333 and 6,228,978. The<br>
invention is not limited by the method of forming the SBHR. The<br>
polydienes/block copolymer, or branching agents (hereinafter "polydienes"), are<br>
typically cationically reactive and are present during the polymerization of the<br>
butyl or halogenated butyl rubber, or can be blended with the butyl or halogenated<br>
butyl rubber to form the SBHR. The branching agent or polydiene can be any<br>
suitable branching agent, and the invention is not limited to the type of polydiene<br>
used to make the SBHR.<br><br>
[0060] In one embodiment, the SBHR is typically a composition of the butyl or<br>
halogenated butyl rubber as described above and a copolymer of a polydiene and a<br>
partially hydrogenated polydiene selected from the group including styrene,<br>
polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polypiperylene, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene<br>
rubber, ethylene-propylene diene rubber, styrene-butadiene-styrene and styrene-<br>
isoprene-styrene block copolymers. These polydienes are present, based on the<br>
monomer weight percent, greater than 0.3 weight percent in one embodiment, and<br>
from 0.3 to 3 weight percent in another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.7 weight<br>
percent in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0061] A commercial embodiment of the SBHR of the present invention is<br>
Bromobutyl 6222 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company), having a Mooney Viscosity<br>
(ML 1+8 at 125°C, ASTM 1646, modified) of from 27 to 37, and a bromine<br>
content of from 2.2 to 2.6 weight percent.<br>
[0062] The halogenated rubber component is present in the blend of the<br>
invention from 10 to 90 phr in one embodiment, from 20 to 80 phr in another<br>
embodiment, and from 30 to 70 phr in yet another embodiment, wherein a<br>
desirable range may be any combination of any upper phr limit with any lower phr<br>
limit.<br>
Functionalized Halogenated Elastomers<br>
[0063] The halogen in the above described halogenated polymer can react or<br>
form polar bonds with functional groups present in the matrix polymer, for<br>
example, acid, amino or hydroxyl functional groups, when the components are<br>
mixed at high temperatures. One embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
nanocomposite comprising a clay and a halogenated elastomer comprising C4 to<br>
C7 isoolefin derived units; wherein a portion of the halogen in the elastomer is<br>
electrophilically substituted with an amine-functionalized group such that the<br>
halogenated elastomer also comprises an amine-functionalized monomer unit<br>
described by the following group pendant to the elastomer E:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br><br>
wherein R and R1 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, C1 to<br>
C7 alkyls, and primary or secondary alkyl halides; and wherein R2, R3 and R4 are<br>
the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or<br>
aryls, substituted C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, C1 to C20 aliphatic alcohols or<br>
ethers, C1 to C20 carboxylic acids, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters<br>
and ammonium ions. In a desirable embodiment, at least one ofR2,R3andR4 are<br>
selected from C1 to C20 alkenes, C1 to C20 aliphatic alcohols, C1 to C20 ahphatic<br>
ethers, C1 to C20 carboxylic acids, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters<br>
and ammonium ions.<br>
10064] In one embodiment, the halogenated elastomer E comprises C4 to C7<br>
isoolefin derived units, para-methylstyrene derived units and para-<br>
(halomethylstyrene) derived units.<br>
[0065] In another embodiment, the halogenated elastomer E comprises C4 to<br>
C7 isoolefin derived units, multiolefin derived units, and halogenated multiolefin<br>
derived units.<br>
[0066] The functional group pendant to the elastomer E can be further<br>
described as functionalized amine, wherein at least one of R2, R3 and R4 is<br>
selected from C1 to C20 aliphatic alcohols or ethers, C1 to C20 carboxylic acids,<br>
nitriles, esters, ammonium ions, or acrylate groups; wherein the acrylate is<br>
described by the following formula:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br><br>
wherein R , R and R are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen<br>
and C1 to C7 alkyl or alkenyl.<br><br>
[0067]        In another embodiment, the amine-functionalized group is selected<br>
from ethoxylated amines having the following structure:<br>
(Formula-Removed)<br><br>
wherein R8 is a C1 to C20 alkyl; and wherein x + y is 2, 5, 10, 15, or 50.<br>
[0068]        In another embodiment, the amine-functionalized group is selected<br>
from dimethylaminoethylacrylate, dimethylaminomethylacrylate, N-methylamino-<br>
bis-2-propanol,  N-ethylamino-bis-2-propanol,   dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate,<br>
diethylaminopropanol,	diethylethanolamine,	dimethylamino-1-propanol,<br>
tripropanolamine, triethanolamine, aminolauric acid, betaine, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0069] The amine-functionalized derived unit may be present on the<br>
halogenated elastomer from 0.01 weight percent to 10 weight percent of the<br>
elastomer in one embodiment, and from 0.1 weight percent to 8 weight percent in<br>
another embodiment, and from 0.2 to 6 weight percent in yet another embodiment,<br>
wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper weight percent<br>
limit with any lower weight percent limit.<br>
Polar Modified Polymer or Oligomer<br>
[0070] A polar oligomer or polymer can be present in compositions and end<br>
use articles of the present invention. The polar polymer can increase the<br>
interaction between the polymer matrix and the clay, facilitating separation,<br>
dispersion or exfoliation of clay aggregates during nanocomposite processing, and<br>
thus can provide a composite with improved barrier properties. The polar<br>
component can also minimize clay re-aggregation during compounding when<br>
forming end-use products. In certain embodiments, the polar polymer can have a<br>
chemical (chain backbone) composition similar to the halogenated or<br>
functionalized halogenated elastomers described above to promote polymer<br>
compatibility. The polar group can be selected from alcohols, ethers, acids,<br>
anhydrides, nitriles, amines including ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters,<br>
ammonium ions, and combinations thereof.<br><br>
(0071] In one embodiment, the polar polymer can be a reaction product<br>
formed by reaction of a polymer with an acid or an acid anhydride. In other<br>
embodiments, the polar polymer can be formed by reaction of a polymer with an<br>
acid anhydride and an initiator. Although acids and acid anhydrides are referred<br>
to generally, one skilled in the art recognizes that incorporation of the acid or acid<br>
anhydride into the polymer can include derivatives and salts of the acid or acid<br>
anhydride.<br>
[0072] In one embodiment, the polar polymer can comprise C4 to C8 isoolefin<br>
derived units. The isoolefin may be a C4 to C8 compound, in one embodiment<br>
selected from isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-<br>
methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The polar polymer may also include<br>
other monomer derived units. In one embodiment, the polar polymer includes at<br>
least one styrenic monomer, which may be any substituted styrene monomer unit,<br>
and desirably is selected from styrene, a-methylstyrene or an alkylstyrene (ortho,<br>
meta, or para), the alkyl selected from any C1 to C5 alkyl or branched chain alkyl.<br>
In a desirable embodiment, the styrenic monomer is P-methylstyrene. In another<br>
embodiment, the polar polymer includes at least one multiolefin, which may be a<br>
C4 to C14 diene, conjugated or not, in one embodiment selected from isoprene,<br>
butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene,<br>
cyclopentadiene, methylcyclopentadiene, piperylene and combinations thereof.<br>
[0073] In one embodiment, the polar polymer includes an isoolefin derived<br>
unit, a multiolefin derived unit, and a styrenic derived unit. In another<br>
embodiment, the polar polymer includes an isoolefin derived unit and a styrenic<br>
derived unit, and in yet another embodiment the polar polymer includes an<br>
isoolefin derived unit and a multiolefin derived unit. In other embodiments, the<br>
polar polymer can be halogenated or functionalized as described above.<br>
[0074] In some embodiments, the acid anhydride can be an organic acid<br>
anhydride. The acid anhydride can be a carboxylic acid anhydride of one of the<br>
following general formulae:<br>
 (Formula-Removed)<br>
where Rl and R2 can be the same or different and are selected from C1 to C20<br>
alkyls, alkenes or aryls, substituted C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, C1 to C20<br>
aliphatic alcohols or ethers, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters and<br>
ammonium ions. In some embodiments the acid anhydride can be maleic<br>
anhydride. In other embodiments the acid anhydride can be succinic anhydride.<br>
[0075] In other embodiments, the acid anhydride can be a phosphoric acid<br>
anhydride or a thioanhydride. In yet other embodiments, the polar group can be a<br>
carboxamide.<br>
[0076] In some embodiments, the acid can be an organic acid. The acid can<br>
be a carboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, a tricarboxylic acid, an bxo carboxylic<br>
acid, a peroxy acid, and the like. In other embodiments, the acid can be a<br>
thiocarboxylic acid, a sulfonic acid, a sulfinic acid, a xanthic acid, sulfenic acid,<br>
sulfamic acid, a phosphonic acid, an amic acid, an azinic acid, an azonic acid, a<br>
hydroxamic acid, an imidic acid, an imino acid, a nitrosolic acid, a nitrolic acid, a<br>
hydrazonic acid, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0077] In other embodiments, the polar oligomer or polymer can be formed by<br>
reaction of a polymer with an acid anhydride and an initiator. In a particular<br>
embodiment, an initiator may be a member of the peroxide family. Particularly<br>
useful peroxides include peresters, perketals, and peroxycarbonates. In some<br>
embodiments, the peroxide can be a peroxybenzoate. Commercial quantities of<br>
these compounds can be obtained from Akzo Nobel, Arkema, Aztec, and others.<br>
As is well known to one skilled in the art, such peroxides are selected on the basis<br>
of their decomposition rates at different temperatures. Such half-life information<br>
is available from the suppliers. The concentration of initiator used to react the<br>
polymer and the acid or acid anhydride can range from about 0 ppm to about 600<br><br>
ppm or more. In still other embodiments of the present invention the initiator may<br>
include a combination of initiators. One skilled in the art will realize that these<br>
concentrations are not limiting and any concentrations yielding a polymer product<br>
with the desirable properties may be employed.<br>
[0078] For example, in some embodiments, the polar polymer can be a<br>
polyisobutylene succinic anhydride, a reaction product of polyisobutylene and<br>
succinic anhydride. In other embodiments, the polar oligomer or polymer can be<br>
a reaction product of the halogenated elastomer described above and maleic<br>
anhydride. In other embodiments, the halogenated elastomer and maleic<br>
anhydride are reacted in the presence of an initiator such as tert-butyl<br>
peroxybenzoate for example.<br>
[0079] The acid or acid anhydride derived unit may be present on the polymer<br>
from 0.01 weight percent to 10 weight percent of the polymer in one embodiment,<br>
and from 0.1 weight percent to 8 weight percent in another embodiment, from 0.2<br>
to 7 weight percent in yet another embodiment, from 0.2 - 5.0 weight percent in<br>
another embodiment, and from 0.3 - 3.0 weight percent in another embodiment,<br>
wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper weight percent<br>
limit with any lower weight percent limit. Where the elastomer may contain<br>
functional groups, the polar polymer can contain a higher content of functional<br>
groups and/or a different functional group or groups, e.g. a type of functional<br>
group that is more polar than the functional groups of the elastomer, so as to<br>
improve exfoliation, intercalation, gas barrier properties, and polymer blend<br>
compatibility.<br>
[0080] In certain embodiments, the nanocomposite of the present invention<br>
can include a halogenated elastomer and a polar polymer, where the polar polymer<br>
can enhance exfoliation, blend compatibility, and gas barrier properties without<br>
the need for additional functionalization of the halogenated elastomer, as<br>
described above. In addition to eliminating process steps, minimizing or avoiding<br>
functionalization of the halogenated elastomer can enhance the curability of the<br>
composite as the aromatic halomethyl groups provide a wide choice of<br>
crosslinking reactions that can be used.<br><br>
[0081]	The interactions between the polar polymers and between the polar<br>
polymers and other components of the nanocomposite of the present invention can<br>
enhance air barrier properties.   Polar or other ionic interactions between the<br>
composite molecules can limit the area through which oxygen or other gases can<br>
permeate, thus improving the barrier properties of the composite.<br>
[0082]	In  some embodiments,  suitable polar polymers derived from an<br>
isomonoolefin and an acid or acid anhydride include polymers having a number<br>
average molecular weight (Mn) of at least about 1,000, preferably at least about<br>
10,000, more preferably at least about 30,000. The copolymers also, preferably,<br>
have a ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average<br>
molecular weight (Mn), i.e., Mw/Mn of less than about 6, preferably less than<br>
about 4, more preferably less than about 2.5.<br>
[0083] In other embodiments, suitable polar oligomers or low polymers have a<br>
number average molecular weight (Mn) of at least about 500, preferably at least<br>
about 1,000, more preferably at least about 2000. The oligomers also, preferably,<br>
have a ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average<br>
molecular weight (Mn), i.e., Mw/Mn of less than about 6, preferably less than<br>
about 4, more preferably less than about 2.5.<br>
[0084] The combined polymer component of the nanocomposites of the<br>
present invention may comprise at least one polymer or elastomer as described in<br>
any of the above polymer or elastomers or may comprise any combination of at<br>
least two or more of the polymers and elastomers described above. In an<br>
embodiment, the elastomer or polymer comprises at least one isobutylene-based<br>
polymer. In another embodiment, the elastomer or polymer comprises at least one<br>
isobutylene-based polymer and at least one other rubber. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the elastomer or polymer comprises at least two or more<br>
isobutylene-based polymers.<br>
Secondary Rubber Component<br>
[0085] A secondary rubber or "general purpose rubber" component may be<br>
present in compositions and end use articles of the present invention. These<br>
rubbers include, but are not limited to, natural rubbers, polyisoprene rubber,<br>
poly(styrene-co-butadiene)    rubber    (SBR),     polybutadiene    rubber    (BR),<br><br>
poly(isoprene-co-butadiene) rubber (IBR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber<br>

(EPDM), polysulfide, nitrile rubber, propylene oxide polymers, star-branched<br>
butyl rubber and halogenated star-branched butyl rubber, brominated butyl rubber,<br>
chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched<br>
brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; poly(isobutylene-<br>
co-p-methylstyrene) and halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene), such<br>
as, for example, terpolymers of isobutylene derived units, p-methylstyrene derived<br>

[0086] A desirable embodiment of the secondary rubber component present is<br>
natural rubber. Natural rubbers are described in detail by Subramaniam in<br>
RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 179-208 (Maurice Morton, Chapman &amp; Hall 1995).<br>
Desirable embodiments of the natural rubbers of the present invention are selected<br>
from Malaysian rubber such as SMR CV, SMR 5, SMR 10, SMR 20, and SMR 50<br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein the natural rubbers have a Mooney viscosity at<br>
100°C (ML 1+4) of from 30 to 120, more preferably from 40 to 65. The Mooney<br>
viscosity test referred to herein is in accordance with ASTM D-1646.<br>
[0087] Polybutadiene (BR) rubber is another desirable secondary rubber<br>
useful in the composition of the invention. The Mooney viscosity of the<br>
polybutadiene rubber as measured at 100°C (ML 1+4) may range from 35 to 70,<br>
from 40 to about 65 in another embodiment, and from 45 to 60 in yet another<br>
embodiment. Some commercial examples of these synthetic rubbers useful in the<br>
present invention are NATSYN™ (Goodyear Chemical Company), and<br>
BUDENE™ 1207 or BR 1207 (Goodyear Chemical Company). A desirable<br>
rubber is high cis-polybutadiene (cis-BR). By "cis-polybutadiene" or "high cis-<br>
polybutadiene", it is meant that 1,4-cis polybutadiene is used, wherein the amount<br>
of cis component is at least 95%. An example of a high cis-polybutadiene<br>
commercial product used in the composition is BUDENE™ 1207.<br>
[0088] Rubbers of ethylene and propylene derived units such as EPM and<br>
EPDM are also suitable as secondary rubbers. Examples of suitable comonomers<br>
in making EPDM are ethylidene norbomene, 1,4-hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, as<br>
well as others.   These rubbers are described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 260-283<br><br>
(1995). A suitable ethylene-propylene rubber is commercially available as<br>
VISTALON™ (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston TX).<br>
[0089] In another embodiment, the secondary rubber is a halogenated rubber<br>
as part of the terpolymer composition. The halogenated butyl rubber is<br>
brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber.<br>
General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in<br>
THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T.<br>
Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (1995). Butyl<br>
rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are described<br>
by Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8 KIRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF<br>
CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993).<br>
[0090] The secondary rubber component of the present invention includes, but<br>
is not limited to at least one or more of brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl<br>
rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl<br>
(polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-p-<br>
methylstyrene), such as, for example, terpolymers of isobutylene derived units, p-<br>
methylstyrene derived units, and p-bromomethylstyrene derived units (BrIBMS),<br>
and the like halomethylated aromatic interpolymers as in US 5,162,445; US<br>
4,074,035; and US 4,395,506; halogenated isoprene and halogenated isobutylene<br>
copolymers, polychloroprene, and the like, and mixtures of any of the above.<br>
Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in US<br>
4,703,091 and US 4,632,963.<br>
[0091] In one embodiment of the invention, a so called semi-crystalline<br>
copolymer ("SCC") is present as the secondary "rubber" component. Semi-<br>
crystalline copolymers are described in WO00/69966. Generally, the SCC is a<br>
copolymer of ethylene or propylene derived units and a-olefin derived units, the<br>
a-olefin having from 4 to 16 carbon atoms in one embodiment, and in another<br>
embodiment the SCC is a copolymer of ethylene derived units and a-olefin<br>
derived units, the a-olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein the SCC has<br>
some degree of crystallinity. In a further embodiment, the SCC is a copolymer of<br>
1-butene derived units and another a-olefin derived unit, the other a-olefin having<br><br>
from 5 to 16 carbon atoms, wherein the SCC also has some degree of crystallinity.<br>
The SCC can also be a copolymer of ethylene and styrene.<br>
[0092] The secondary rubber component of the elastomer composition may be<br>
present in a range from up to 90 phr in one embodiment, from up to 50 phr in<br>
another embodiment, from up to 40 phr in another embodiment, and from up to 30<br>
phr in yet another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the secondary rubber<br>
is present from at least 2 phr, and from at least 5 phr in another embodiment, and<br>
from at least 5 phr in yet another embodiment, and from at least 10 phr in yet<br>
another embodiment. A desirable embodiment may include any combination of<br>
any upper phr limit and any lower phr limit. For example, the secondary rubber,<br>
either individually or as a blend of rubbers such as, for example NR and BR, may<br>
be present from 5 phr to 90 phr in one embodiment, and from 10 to 80 phr in<br>
another embodiment, and from 30 to 70 phr in yet another embodiment, and from<br>
40 to 60 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 5 to 50 phr in yet another<br>
embodiment, and from 5 to 40 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 20 to 60<br>
phr in yet another embodiment, and from 20 to 50 phr in yet another embodiment,<br>
the chosen embodiment depending upon the desired end use application of the<br>
composition.<br>
Fillers, Curatives and Other Additives<br>
[0093] The composition of the invention may also include one or more filler<br>
components such as calcium carbonate, clay, mica, silica and silicates, talc,<br>
titanium dioxide, and carbon black. As used herein, fillers do not include<br>
inorganic clay and/or organoclay particles forming part of the nanocomposite<br>
matrix, e.g. clay particles having a dimension in the nanometer range, but larger<br>
clay particles can be used as a filler in the nanocomposites, if desired. In one<br>
embodiment, the filler is carbon black or modified carbon black. The preferred<br>
filler is semi-reinforcing grade carbon black present at a level of from 10 to 150<br>
phr of the blend, more preferably from 30 to 120 phr. Useful grades of carbon<br>
black as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 59-85 (1995) range from N110 to<br>
N990. More desirably, embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example,<br>
tire treads are N229, N351, N339, N220, N234 and N110 provided in ASTM<br>
(D3037, D1510, and D3765).   Embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for<br>
example, sidewalls in tires are N330, N351, N550, N650, N660, and N762.<br>
Embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, innerliners for tires are<br>
N550, N650, N660, N762, and N990.<br>
[0094] The composition of this invention may optionally include curative<br>
systems which are capable of curing the functionalized elastomeric copolymer<br>
component of the blend to provide vulcanizable compositions. Suitable curative<br>
systems for the elastomeric copolymer component of the present invention include<br>
organic peroxides, zinc oxide in combination with zinc stearate or stearic acid and,<br>
optionally, one or more of the following accelerators or vulcanizing agents:<br>
Permalux (di-ortho-tolylguanidine salt of dicatechol borate), HVA-2 (m-<br>
phenylene bis maleimide), Zisnet (2, 4, 6- trimercapto- 5 triazine), ZDEDC (zinc<br>
diethyl dithiocarbamate) and other dithiocarbamates, Tetrone A (dipenta-<br>
methylene thiuram hexasulfide), Vultac-5 (alkylated phenol disulfide), SP1045<br>
(phenol formaldehyde resin), SP1056 (brominated alkyl phenol formaldehyde<br>
resin), DPPD. (diphenyl phenylene diamine), salicyclic acid (o-hydroxy benzoic<br>
acid), wood rosin (abietic acid), and TMTDS (tetramethyl thiuram disulfide) in<br>
combination with sulfur. The composition may also be cured using ultraviolet<br>
light or electron irradiation.<br>
[0095] The compositions of the invention may also contain other conventional<br>
additives such as dyes, pigments, antioxidants, heat and light stabilizers,<br>
plasticizers, oils and other ingredients as known in the art.<br>
[0096] Blending of the fillers, additives, and/or curative components may be<br>
carried out by combining the desired components and the nanocomposite of the<br>
present invention in any suitable mixing device such as a Banbury™ mixer,<br>
Brabender™ mixer or preferably a mixer/extruder and mixing at temperatures in<br>
the range of 120°C up to 300°C under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the<br>
components to become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form the<br>
nanocomposite.<br>
[0097] The composition of this invention may be extruded, compression molded,<br>
blow molded or injection molded into various shaped articles including fibers,<br>
films, industrial parts such as automotive parts, appliance housings, consumer<br>
products, packaging and the like.  The resulting articles exhibit both high impact<br><br>
strength and low vapor permeability.   In particular, the composition described<br>
herein is useful for air barriers such as bladders, and automotive (including truck,<br>
commercial and/or passenger) or aircraft innerliners and innertubes.<br>
Clays<br>
10098] The nanocomposites of the present invention can include swellable<br>
inorganic clay. Swellable layered inorganic clay materials suitable for the<br>
purposes of this invention include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly<br>
smectic clays such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite,<br>
laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, stevensite and the like,<br>
as well as vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, hydrotalcite and the like.<br>
These layered clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate<br>
platelets having a thickness of 8-12A tightly bound together at interlayer spacings<br>
of 4A or less, and contain exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+2, K+ or Mg+2<br>
present at the interlayer surfaces.<br>
[0099] The layered clay can be exfoliated by suspending the clay in a water<br>
solution. Preferably, the concentration of clay in water is sufficiently low to<br>
minimize the interaction between clay particles and to fully exfoliate the clay. In<br>
one embodiment, the aqueous slurry of clay can have a clay concentration of<br>
between 0.1 and 5.0 weight percent; between 0.1 and 3.0 weight percent in other<br>
embodiments.<br>
[00100] In certain embodiments, an aqueous slurry of clay can be prepared by<br>
stirring clay and water at room temperature for a time sufficient to exfoliate the<br>
clay. In one embodiment, the clay and water can be stirred for between 0.25 and<br>
24 hours. The clay and water can be stirred for between 4 and 16 hours, or<br>
between 10 and 14 hours, in other embodiments.<br>
[00101] In other embodiments, the clay can be mixed with an organic liquid to<br>
form a clay dispersion. The clay can be an inorganic clay or an organically<br>
modified clay; the organic liquid can be miscible or immiscible in water. In<br>
certain embodiments, the dispersion can have a clay concentration of between 0.1<br>
and 5.0 weight percent; between 0.1 and 3.0 weight percent in other embodiments.<br>
[00102] The layered clay can also be intercalated and exfoliated by treatment<br>
with organic molecules (swelling or exfoliating "agents" or "additives") capable of<br><br>
undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer<br>
surfaces of the layered silicate. Suitable exfoliating additives include cationic<br>
surfactants such as ammonium ion, alkylamines or alkylammonium ion (primary,<br>
secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of<br>
aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides. Desirable<br>
amine compounds (or the corresponding ammonium ion) are those with the<br>
structure R12R13R14N, wherein R12, R13, and R14 are C1 to C30 alkyls or alkenes in<br>
one embodiment, Ci to C20 alkyls or alkenes in another embodiment, which may<br>
be the same or different. In one embodiment, the exfoliating agent is a so called<br>
long chain tertiary amine, wherein at least R12 is a C14 to C20 alkyl or alkene.<br>
[00103] The exfoliating agent can also be a diamine compound (or the<br>
corresponding ammonium or diammonium ion), such as diaminoalkane, N-alkyl-<br>
diaminoalkane, N,N-dialkyl-diaminoalkyl, N,N,N'-trialkyl-diaminoalkane,<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetraalkyl-diaminoalkane, or the like. Desirable diamines can have the<br>
structure R18R19N-R20-NR21R22, wherein R18, R19, R20, R21, and R22 are the same<br>
or different C1 to C30 alkyls or alkenes, or C1 to C20 alkyls or alkenes. When a<br>
long chain diamine is desired, at least one of the N-alkyl or N-alkene groups has<br>
from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 14 to 20 carbon atoms. Specific non-<br>
limiting, illustrative examples include N-coco-l,3-diaminopropane, N-oleyl-1,3-<br>
diaminopropane, N-tallow-l,3-diaminopropane, N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-tallow-l,3-<br>
diaminopropane, and so on.<br>
[00104] Another class of exfoliating additives include those which can be<br>
covalently bonded to the interlayer surfaces. These include polysilanes of the<br>
structure -Si(R15)2R16 where R15 is the same or different at each occurrence and is<br>
selected from alkyl, alkoxy or oxysilane and R16 is an organic radical compatible<br>
with the matrix polymer of the composite.<br>
[00105] Other suitable exfoliating additives include protonated amino acids and<br>
salts thereof containing 2-30 carbon atoms such as 12-aminododecanoic acid,<br>
epsilon-caprolactam and like materials. Suitable swelling agents and processes<br>
for intercalating layered silicates are disclosed in US 4,472,538, 4,810,734,<br>
4,889,885 as well as WO92/02582.<br><br>
[00106] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the exfoliating additive or<br>
additives are capable of reaction with the halogen sites on the interpolymer to<br>
form complexes which help exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the additive<br>
includes all primary, secondary and tertiary amines and phosphines; alkyl and aryl<br>
sulfides and thiols; and their polyfunctional versions. Desirable additives include:<br>
long-chain tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethyl-octadecylamine, N,N-<br>
dioctadecyl-methylamine, so called dihydrogenated tallowalkyl-methylamine and<br>
the like, and amine-terminated polytetrahydrofuran; long-chain thiol and<br>
thiosulfate compounds like hexamethylene sodium thiosulfate.<br>
[00107] The exfoliating additive such as described herein is present in the<br>
composition in an amount to achieve optimal air retention as measured by the<br>
permeability testing described herein. For example, the additive may be present<br>
from 0.1 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 15 phr in yet another<br>
embodiment, and from 0.3 to 10 phr in yet another embodiment. The exfoliating<br>
additive may be added to the composition at any stage; for example, the additive<br>
may be added to the interpolymer, followed by addition of the clay, or may be<br>
added to the interpolymer and clay mixture; or the additive may be first blended<br>
with the clay, followed by blending with the interpolymer in yet another<br>
embodiment.<br>
[00108] In another embodiment of the invention, improved interpolymer<br>
impermeability is achieved by the presence of at least one polyfunctional curative.<br>
An embodiment of such polyfunctional curatives can be described by the formula<br>
Z--R17-Z', wherein R17 is one of a Ci to Ci5 alkyl, C2 to Ci5 alkenyl, and C6 to C12<br>
cyclic aromatic moiety, substituted or unsubstituted; and Z and Z1 are the same or<br>
different and are one of a thiosulfate group, mercapto group, aldehyde group,<br>
carboxylic acid group, peroxide group, alkenyl group, or other similar group that<br>
is capable of crosslinking, either intermolecularly or intramolecularly, one or more<br>
strands of a polymer having reactive groups such as unsaturation. So-called bis-<br>
thiosulfate compounds are an example of a desirable class of polyfunctional<br>
compounds included in the above formula. Non-limiting examples of such<br>
polyfunctional curatives are as hexamethylene bis(sodium thiosulfate) and<br>
hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde), and others are well known in the rubber<br><br>
compounding arts. These and other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example,<br>
the BLUE BOOK, MATERIALS, COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND<br>
SERVICES FOR RUBBER (Don. R. Smith, ed., Lippincott &amp; Petto Inc. 2001). The<br>
polyfunctional curative, if present, may be present in the composition from 0.1 to<br>
8 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 5 phr in yet another embodiment.<br>
[00109] Treatment with the swelling agents described above results in<br>
intercalation or "exfoliation" of the layered platelets as a consequence of a<br>
reduction of the ionic forces holding the layers together and introduction of<br>
molecules between layers which serve to space the layers at distances of greater<br>
than 4A, preferably greater than 9A. This separation allows the layered silicate to<br>
more readily sorb polymerizable monomer material and polymeric material<br>
between the layers and facilitates further delamination of the layers when the<br>
intercalate is shear mixed with matrix polymer material to provide a uniform<br>
dispersion of the exfoliated layers within the polymer matrix.<br>
[00110] The amount of clay or exfoliated clay incorporated in the<br>
nanocomposites in accordance with this invention is sufficient to develop an<br>
improvement in the mechanical properties or barrier properties of the<br>
nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability. Amounts of<br>
clay in the nanocomposite generally will range from 0.5 to 10 weight percent in<br>
one embodiment, and from 1 to 5 weight percent in another embodiment, based on<br>
the polymer content of the nanocomposite. Expressed in parts per hundred rubber,<br>
the clay or exfoliated clay may be present from 1 to 30 phr in one embodiment,<br>
and from 5 to 20 phr in another embodiment.<br>
Nanocomposite Processing<br>
[00111] Nanocomposites can be formed using a variety of processes. For<br>
example, in commonly assigned US Application Serial No. 11/183,361 by Gong<br>
et al, filed July 18, 2005, (2005B093) there is disclosed a method for preparing<br>
clay-butyl rubber nanocomposites from an emulsion of rubber solution and<br>
aqueous clay dispersion in which the clay can be an inorganic clay. As another<br>
example of nanocomposite processing, in commonly assigned US Application<br>
Serial No. 11/184,000 by Weng et al, also filed July 18, 2005, (2005B092) there<br>
is  disclosed  a method  for preparing clay-butyl rubber nanocomposites by<br><br>
preparing a concentrated nanocomposite from a slipstream of the rubber and<br>
blending the concentrate with a main rubber stream.<br>
Melt Blending:<br>
[00112]       The nanocomposite of the present invention can be formed by a<br>
polymer melt blending process. Blending of the components can be carried out by<br>
combining the polymer components and the clay in the form of an intercalate in<br>
any suitable mixing device such as a Banbury™ mixer, Brabender™ mixer or<br>
preferably a mixer/extruder and mixing at temperatures in the range of 120°C up<br>
to 300°C under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the clay intercalate to<br>
exfoliate and become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form the<br>
nanocomposite.<br>
Emulsion Processes:<br>
[00113]       The nanocomposite of the present invention can also be formed by an<br>
emulsion processes.    In one embodiment, the emulsion process can comprise<br>
mixing an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay with a polymer solution (cement). The<br>
mixing should be sufficiently vigorous to form emulsions or micro-emulsions. In<br>
some embodiments, the emulsions can be formed as an aqueous solution or<br>
suspension in an organic solution. Standard methods and equipment for both lab<br>
and large-scale production, including batch and continuous processes may be used<br>
to produce the polymeric nanocomposites of the invention.<br>
[00114]       In certain embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process<br>
comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered clay<br>
with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer; and removing the<br>
solvent and water from the contact product of Solution A and Solution B to<br>
recover a nanocomposite. In certain embodiments, the emulsion is formed by<br>
subjecting the mixture to agitation using a high-shear mixer.<br>
[00115]       In some embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process<br>
comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered clay<br>
with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer, wherein the<br>
contacting is performed in the presence of an emulsifier or surfactant.<br>
[00116]       The emulsions of the present invention are formed by conventional<br>
emulsion technology, that is, subjecting a mixture of the hydrocarbon, water and<br><br>
surfactant, when used, to sufficient shearing, as in a commercial blender or its<br>
equivalent for a period of time sufficient for forming the emulsion, e.g., generally<br>
at least a few seconds. For general emulsion information, see generally, "Colloidal<br>
Systems and Interfaces", S. Ross and I. D. Morrison, J. W. Wiley, NY, 1988. The<br>
emulsion can be allowed to remain in emulsion form, with or without continuous<br>
or intermittent mixing or agitation, with or without heating or other temperature<br>
control, for a period sufficient to enhance exfoliation of the clay, from 0.1 to 100<br>
hours or more in one embodiment, from 1 to 50 hours in another embodiment, and<br>
from 2 to 20 hours in another embodiment.<br>
[00117] When used, the surfactant concentration is sufficient to allow the<br>
formation of a relatively stable emulsion. Preferably, the amount of surfactant<br>
employed is at least 0.001 weight percent of the total emulsion, more preferably<br>
about 0.001 to about 3 weight percent, and most preferably 0.01 to less than 2<br>
weight percent.<br>
[00118] Cationic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions of this invention<br>
include tertiary amines, diamines, polyamines, amine salts, as well as quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds. Non-ionic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions<br>
of this invention include alkyl ethoxylates, linear alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl<br>
glucosides, amide ethoxylates, amine ethoxylates (coco-, tallow-, and oleyl- amine<br>
ethoxylates for example), phenol ethoxylates, and nonyl phenol ethoxylates.<br>
[00119]       Solution Blending:<br>
[00120] The nanocomposite of the present invention can also be formed by<br>
solution blending, such as described in commonly assigned US Application Serial<br>
No. 60/585,629 by Weng et al, filed July 6, 2004, (2004B085) for example. In<br>
certain embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising<br>
contacting Solution A comprising a solvent comprising a hydrocarbon and at least<br>
one layered filler or clay with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one<br>
elastomer, and removing the solvents from the contact product of Solution A and<br>
Solution B to form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00121] In the previous embodiments, the layered filler may be a layered clay<br>
treated with organic molecules as described above. In yet another embodiment, a<br>
nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising contacting at least one<br><br>
elastomer and at least one layered filler in a solvent; and removing the solvent<br>
from the contact product to form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00122]       In another embodiment, a nanocomposite is produced by a process<br>
comprising contacting at least one elastomer and at least one layered filler in a<br>
solvent mixture comprising two solvents; and removing the solvent mixture from<br>
the contact product to form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00123]       In still another embodiment, a nanocomposite is produced by a process<br>
comprising contacting at least one elastomer and at least one layered filler in a<br>
solvent mixture comprising at least two or more solvents; and removing the<br>
solvent mixture from the contact product to form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00124]       In another embodiment, a nanocomposite is produced by a process to<br>
form a contact product comprising dissolving at least one elastomer and then<br>
dispersing at least one layered filler in a solvent or solvent mixture comprising at<br>
least two solvents; and removing the solvent mixture from the contact product to<br>
form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00125]       In yet another embodiment, a nanocomposite is produced by a process<br>
to form a contact product comprising dispersing at least one layered filler and then<br>
dissolving at least one elastomer in a solvent or solvent mixture comprising at<br>
least two solvents; and removing the solvent mixture from the contact product to<br>
form a nanocomposite.<br>
[00126]       In the embodiments described above, solvents may be present in the<br>
production of the nanocomposite composition from 30 to 99 wt %, alternatively<br>
from 40 to 99 wt %, alternatively from 50 to 99 wt %, alternatively from 60 to 99<br>
wt %, alternatively from 70 to 99 wt %, alternatively from 80 to 99 wt %,<br>
alternatively from 90 to 99 wt %, alternatively from 95 to 99 wt %, based upon the<br>
total wt of the composition.<br>
[00127]       Additionally, in certain embodiments, when two or more solvents are<br>
prepared in the production of the nanocomposite composition, each solvent may<br>
comprise from 0.1 to 99.9 vol %, alternatively from 1 to 99 vol %, alternatively<br>
from 5 to 95 vol %, and alternatively from 10 to 90 vol %, with the total volume<br>
of all solvents present at 100 vol %.<br><br>
[00128] In still other embodiments, a nanocomposite formed from an above<br>
described process to improve the air impermeability of an elastomer has an<br>
oxygen transmission rate of 150 mm.cc/[m2.day] at 40°C or lower as measured on<br>
cured nanocomposite compositions or articles as described herein.<br>
[00129] Alternatively, the oxygen transmission rate is 150 mm.cc/[m2 .day] at<br>

[00130] The composition of this invention may be extruded, compression<br>
molded, blow molded or injection molded into various shaped articles including<br>
fibers, films, industrial parts such as automotive parts, appliance housings,<br>
consumer products, packaging and the like. The resulting articles exhibit both<br>
high impact strength and low vapor permeability. In particular, the composition<br>
described herein is useful for air barriers such as bladders, and automotive<br>
(including truck, commercial and/or passenger) or aircraft innerliners and<br>
innertubes.<br><br>
Permeability Testing<br>
[00131] For each of the following examples, the nanocomposites formed were<br>
analyzed for permeability properties using the following method. In certain<br>
embodiments, 36 grams of the clay-rubber mixture was loaded into a Brabender®<br>
mixer at a temperature of 130 - 145°C and mixed with 20 grams of carbon black<br>
(N660) for 7 minutes. The mixture was further mixed with a curatives package of<br>
0.33 g stearic acid, 0.33 g Kadox® 911, and 0.33 g MBTS at 40°C and 40 rpm for<br>
3 minutes. The resulting rubber compounds were milled, compression molded<br>
and cured at 170°C. All specimens were compression molded with slow cooling<br>
to provide defect free pads. A compression and curing press was used for rubber<br>
samples. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is around 15 mil. using<br>
an Arbor press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for<br>
permeability testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60°C<br>
overnight prior to the measurement. The oxygen permeation measurements were<br>
done using a Mocon™ OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40°C under the<br>
principle of R. A. Pasternak et. al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2<br>
467 (1970). Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with a<br>
vacuum grease. 10 psi nitrogen was kept on one side of the disk, whereas the other<br>
side is 10 psi oxygen. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in<br>
oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored. The<br>
time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen<br>
concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used<br>
to determine the oxygen permeability. Permeability was measured as oxygen<br>
transmission rate on a Mocon™ WX-TRAN 2/61 at 40°C. Where multiple<br>
samples were prepared using the same procedure, permeation rates are given for<br>
each sample.<br>
[00132]       In certain embodiments, a useful formulation for property evaluation<br>
would be as follows:<br><br>
Material LP.	Parts<br>
Elastomer/Clay	100 + x parts of clay<br>
Carbon black N660	60.0<br>
Stearic Acid	1.0<br>
ZnOKadox™911	1.0<br>
MBTS	1.0<br>
[00133]       Carbon black N660 can be obtained from, e.g., Cabot Corp. (Billerica,<br>
MA).    Stearic acid, a cure agent, can be obtained from, e.g., C. K. Witco<br>
Corp.(Taft, LA),    Kadox® 911, an activator, can be obtained from C. P. Hall<br>
(Chicago, IL).  MBTS, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide, can be obtained from<br>
R. T. Vanderbilt (Norwalk, CT) or Elastochem (Chardon, OH).<br>
[00134]       In   certain   examples   below,   polyisobutylene   succinic   anhydride<br>
(PIBSA) is used, and can be obtained from INFENIUM, USA (Linden, NJ). The<br>
PIBSA grades available from INFENIUM can have a number average molecular<br>
weight ranging from 600 to about 2200. As used in the examples, PIBSA 48 has a<br>
number average molecular weight of about 2200.<br>
