MACHINE CONTROL METHOD FOR SPINNING MACHINE<br>
APPLICANT<br>
KABUSHIKI KAISHA TOYOTA JIDOSHOKKI<br>
2-1, Toyoda-cho Kariya-shi Aichi-ken<br>
Japan<br>
 Nationality : a Japanese company<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
MACHINE CONTROL METHOD FOR SPINNING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a machine control method for a spinning machine such as a ring spinning machine, a ring twisting machine, a drawing-twisting machine or a roving machine.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 58-115133 discloses art 1 in which a camera (201) is attached to a traveling unit (200) that moves along the front face of a fine spinning machine (100). During movement of the traveling unit (200), fiber bundle feed region (A), draft part region (B) or region where yarn is about to be wound on a cop, or all of those regions is shot by the camera (201) for judging whether or not the yarn breaks.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 7-3545 discloses art in which a monitoring camera (14) is attached to a roving replacing device (4) that serves to replace a roving bobbin (B) hung in the upper part of a fine spinning machine (1) with a new full bobbin (F) which fully includes roving. 20 Operating states are monitored by shooting or taking images of a cycle of roving replacement operation by the roving replacing device (4).<br>
-1-<br><br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 8-3829 discloses art in which a small-sized camera (35) is attached to a doffing device (106) that moves above the winding units (102) of a winder (101) so that it faces toward the tenser rollers (127a) of the winding units (102). When the doffing device (106) that is moving stops for doffing a package (P) at the winding unit (102) that has finished winding, the associated tenser roller (127a) is shot by the small-sized camera (35). The small-sized camera (35) converts the rotational state of the tenser roller (127a) into an electric signal based on a mark (37) on the tenser roller (127a) as a home position and sends it to an operation part (3). The electric signal is compared with the pattern that is pre-stored in the operation part (3) for judging whether or not the tenser roller (127a) rotates.<br>
In the art of the publication No. 58-115133, only yarn breakage is detected. Furthermore, a special range needs to be set in a television screen in order to recognize that an object whose image is shot by the camera is fiber bundle or yarn. This art cannot be used for shooting or taking an image of other portion of the spinning machine. Thus, this art cannot be used for controlling various portions of the spinning machine.<br>
In the art of the publication No. 7-3545, the states of specific operation, that is, roving replacement operation of the fine spinning machine, are shot and monitored. This art cannot be used for other portions of the<br>
-2-<br><br>
Spinning machine. Thus, this art cannot be used for controlling various portions of the spinning machine similarly to the publication No. 58-115133.<br>
The art of the publication No. 8-3829 is used for only detecting a specific operating state or the rotational state of the tenser roller and does not have wide usability. The specific winding unit which has finished winding is shot when doffing is performed there. The winding unit is not shot at any other period. Thus, this art cannot be used for controlling various portions of the spinning machine similarly to the publication Nos. 58-115133 and 7-3545.<br>
The present invention is directed to a machine control method for controlling a spinning machine by repeatedly shooting or taking images of the spinning unit of the spinning machine, storing the shot data and displaying them on a display.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a machine control method for a spinning machine having a plurality of spinning units that are arranged in parallel in a longitudinal direction of the spinning machine. The machine control method includes the steps of providing a camera to a traveling body that is movable in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine so that<br>
-3-<br><br>
the camera faces toward the spinning machine; moving the traveling body along the spinning units at certain intervals for patrolling the spinning machine; shooting the spinning unit by the camera during the patrol of the traveling body; storing shot data of the spinning unit that is shot during the patrol of the traveling body in a memory; and displaying on a display the shot data as visual data or as analysis data obtained from the shot data.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following will describe a ring spinning machine of a preferred  embodiment of the present invention. FIGs. 1 and 2 show a ring spinning machine 1 and a blower type movable cleaning device 2 that is movable above the ring spinning machine 1 in the longitudinal direction thereof. The ring spinning machine 1 has a known structure. More specifically, a great number of spindles 3 are arranged on the frame provided between a gear end GE and an out end OE and on each of a right side R (or a right side as seen in FIG. 1) and a left side L (or a left side as seen in FIG. 1) of the ring spinning machine 1. The spindles 3 are driven to rotate through a belt 6 wound on a tin pulley 4 and a tension pulley 5. A bobbin B is fitted onto each spindle 3, and yarn is wound on the bobbin B according to the operation of the ring spinning machine 1. Draft parts 7 are provided above the spindles 3. A creel 8 is provided above the draft parts 7. A great number of roving bobbins 9 and guides 10 for guiding roving drawn from the roving bobbins 9 are hung from the creel 8. The spinning unit of the ring spinning machine 1 includes a roving supply section having the roving bobbins 9 and the guides 10, the draft parts 7 and a winding section having the spindles 3. It is noted that in FIG. 2 the reference numeral “11” designates the suction duct of a pneumatic device provided under the draft parts 7. When yarn breaks, the suction duct 11 sucks<br>
-6-<br><br>
fleece that is sent out from the draft part 7 of the spinning unit where the yarn breakage has occurred.<br>
The cleaning device 2 corresponds to a traveling body of the present invention and has substantially the same structure for cleaning function as those used for conventional ring spinning machines (cf. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2000-96365). More specifically, a pair of rails 12 is provided above the creel 8 extending in the longitudinal direction of the ring spinning machine 1. A movable body 13 of the cleaning device 2 is movably mounted on the rails 12. The movable body 13 includes a pair of suction pipes 14 and a pair of blow pipes 15 which are hung therefrom in front of the ring spinning machine 1 on the right side R and the left side L of the ring spinning machine 1, respectively. Each of the suction pipes 14 has an auxiliary suction nozzle 16 branching therefrom, and each of the blow pipes 15 has an auxiliary spray nozzle 17 branching therefrom.<br>
The paired rails 12 are supported by a rod 18 mounted on the gear end GE. The rod 18 further supports a drive motor 19 and a drive pulley 20 fixed to the drive shaft of the drive motor 19. A drive belt 21 is wound on the drive pulley 20 and a driven pulley (not shown) supported by a rod (not shown) that is mounted on the out end OE. The drive belt 21 is connected to the movable body 13 for reciprocatably moving the movable body 13 in the<br>
-7-<br><br>
longitudinal direction of the ring spinning machine 1. The movable body 13 is equipped with an air blower (not shown) which provides air to the blow pipes 15 and the auxiliary spray nozzles 17 and negative pressure to the suction pipes 14 and the auxiliary suction nozzles 16.<br>
In FIGs. 1 and 2, the reference numeral 22 designates ring rails that move up and down in winding yarn on the bobbin B for traversing the yarn thereon. As generally known, each of the ring rails 22 has travelers (not shown). Spindle numbers R01, R02, R03...RN are marked on the front face of the ring rail 22 on the right side R of the ring spinning machine 1 for indicating the positions of the spinning units in the longitudinal direction thereof. Although not shown, the spindle numbers L01, L02, L03...LN are marked on the front face of the ring rail 22 on the left side L of the ring spinning machine 1 for indicating the positions of the spinning units on the left side L in the longitudinal direction thereof. As long as the position of each spindle unit is recognized, labels (markings) for indicating the positions of the spinning units in the longitudinal direction are marked in any manner, such as by painting, printing or attaching stickers. The labels do not have to be marked on the ring rails 22. As long as each spinning unit is recognized, the labels may be marked at any location. However, the front face of the ring rail 22 is the most preferable for making the spindle numbers. Alternatively, all of the spindle units are divided into a plurality of blocks which are numbered by block<br>
-8-<br><br>
numbers. Serial numbers are assigned to the spindle units in each block, so that the position of each spindle unit is recognized by a combination of the block number and the serial number.<br>
Brackets 23 through 25 are fixed to each of the paired suction pipes<br>
14 of the cleaning device 2 in such a manner that the positions thereof are variable. Cameras 26 through 28 are fixed to the brackets 23 through 25 on each side, respectively. The camera 26 is set so that it points to a path of roving from the roving bobbin 9 through the guide 10 to the draft part 7. The camera 27 is set so that it points to the draft part 7. The camera 28 is set so that it points to the bobbin B and the ring rail 22 as the winding section.<br>
The following will describe the above-described cleaning device 2 and the cameras 26 through 28 with reference to the schematic view shown in FIG. 3. Three ring spinning machines 001 through 003 are shown in FIG. 3. Machine control devices 29 through 31 are provided at the gear ends GE of the ring spinning machines 001 through 003, respectively. In the ring spinning machines 001 through 003, the drive motors 19 of the cleaning devices 2 and the cameras 26 through 28 (only the cameras 28 are shown in FIG. 3.) fixed to the cleaning device 2 are connected to the machine control devices 29 through 31 via wires 32 through 34, respectively, or alternatively by wireless.<br>
-9-<br><br>
Each of the machine control devices 29 through 31 has an operation control program for operating the ring spinning machine, a cleaning program for cleaning the ring spinning machine at certain time intervals including restart-up period after bobbin replacement of the ring spinning machine, and a shooting program in which motion timing of shooting by the cameras 26 through 28 are set. The cleaning devices 2 for the ring spinning machines 001 through 003 are reciprocatably moved according to command signals from the machine control devices 29 through 31 for patrolling the ring spinning machines 001 through 003. During this movement, the cleaning devices 2 perform cleaning work, and the cameras 26 through 28 shoot or take images of the ring spinning machines according to the set motion timing.<br>
The machine control devices 29 through 31 are connected to a main control device 36 via a wire 35, or alternatively by wireless. The main control device 36 has a memory 37 constituted of ROM and RAM and a central processing unit (CPU) 38 and serves to perform input and output of various data, process data and store therein the processed results. The main control device 36 is connected to a display 40 having an input-output unit via a wire 39, or alternatively by wireless, for displaying required data thereon and performing input-output operation of required data. It is noted that the main control device 36 and the display 40 are actually formed integrally but shown separately in FIG. 3 for convenience of explanation. Shot data or the data of<br>
-10-<br><br>
the images which are shot by the cameras 26 through 28 during the movement of the cleaning device 2 in front of the ring spinning machine are sent to the machine control devices 29 through 31, respectively, then sent therefrom to the main control device 36 and stored in the memory 37. Alternatively, serial communication network, local area network or the like may be used for the connection among the cameras 26 through 28, the machine control devices 29 through 31 and the main control device 36.<br>
The above-described operation control program, the above-described  cleaning program and the above-described shooting program are set in the main control device 36 by input operation, sent to the machine control devices 29 through 31, and stored in the memories of the machine control devices 29 through 31. Alternatively, each of those programs is directly set in each of the machine control devices 29 through 31 by input operation.<br>
The main control device 36 has a program for stopping and moving the cleaning device 2 that is moving for cleaning work. According to predetermination of a specific spinning unit or real-time input operation by an operator, the main control device 36 sends a stop command signal to any or all of the machine control devices 29 through 31 for stopping the movement of the cleaning device 2 at the specific spinning unit. After the cleaning device 2 is stopped, the cameras 26 through 28 shoot or take images of only the<br>
-11-<br><br>
winding section of the spinning unit or the entire spinning unit. Like the shot data which is shot during movement of the cleaning device 2, the data of this images (or shot data) are sent to the machine control devices 29 through 31.<br>
The images of the ring spinning machine or the shot data which are<br>
Shot by the cameras 26 through 28 include the following image forms. The images which are shot during the movement of the cleaning device 2 are basically moving images but can be changed into serially shot still images according to setting. Similarly, the images which are shot during the stop of the cleaning device 2 are basically moving images but can be changed into still images according to setting. Operation for changing the image forms can be performed at any of the main control device 36, the machine control devices 29 through 31 and the cameras 26 through 28. When each image is shot, date and time when shot, machine number, location where shot are automatically recorded in the associated shot data according to setting by a method described later. As to location information, other than the spinning unit, each location in the spinning unit from the roving bobbin 9 to the spindle 3 is recognized by the cameras 26 through 28. Thus, a recognition number is assigned to each camera, and each location in the spinning unit is recognized by recording the associated the recognition number in the shot data.<br>
The period during when the cleaning device 2 stops is predetermined<br>
-12-<br><br>
but changeable appropriately according to need. It is possible to set so that the cleaning device 2 automatically starts when the predetermined stop period has elapsed. During the stop of the cleaning device 2, it is preferable that the operation of the air blower in the movable body 13 should be stopped.<br>
As described above, the program for stopping and moving the cleaning device 2 is set in the main control device 36. Alternatively, this program may be set in the machine control devices 29 through 31 for sending therefrom a command signal for stopping or moving the cleaning device 2.<br>
The shot data sent to the main control device 36 is displayed on the display 40 for the operator to see conditions of each spinning unit or conditions between the spinning units at the moment when the images are shot and to judge whether each condition is normal or abnormal. Furthermore, the abnormality of the ring spinning machine or tendency thereto can be recognized as data by analyzing the shot data. According to need, abnormality or warning is denoted on the display 40, or a certain work is performed for dealing with the abnormality or the tendency. Object of analyzing the shot data includes yarn breakage, state of cotton fly which is accumulated at the clearer roller of the draft part 7, installation of a wrong traveler, state of abrasion of a traveler, and installation of a wrong element.<br>
-13-<br><br>
For example, the analysis object is analyzed by pattern recognition. In the case of judging yarn breakage, the shape of yam balloon during appropriate spinning operation or the shot data of the yarn balloon is pattern zed, and the pattern zed shot data is stored as standard data. The shot data or the shot image of the yarn balloon of the spinning unit is patternized and collated as comparison data with the standard data. When yarn breakage has occurred at the spinning unit whose image is shot, the patterns of the yarn balloons of the comparison data and the standard data do not correspond to each other, so that the yarn breakage is judged.<br>
As to the installation of a wrong traveler, the shape of yarn balloon in the shot data of each spinning unit which is shot shortly after traveler installation is collated with the shape of yarn balloon which is stored as standard data. If the size of the yarn balloon is significantly different from that of the standard data, the installation of a wrong traveler is judged. It is noted the installation of a wrong traveler can be judged by merely comparing yarn balloons of the shot spinning units without standard data. More specifically, shooting or taking images of the spinning units along the longitudinal direction of the ring spinning machine, the spinning unit having the yarn balloon whose shape is distinctly different from that of the yarn balloon of the adjacent spindles is judged as a suspicious spinning unit where a wrong traveler is installed. In this case, storage of and comparison with standard data is not<br>
-14-<br><br>
required, thereby requiring less storage capacity of and control load on the main control device 36 or the machine control devices 29 through 31. This method for detecting the abnormality by comparing the adjacent spindles without standard data may be applied to monitoring for yarn breakage, installation of a wrong element or the like.<br>
In the case of judging abrasion state of a traveler, the shape of yarn balloon in the shot data of each spinning unit which is shot after traveler replacement is compared with the shape of yarn balloon which is stored as<br>
standard data, and the deviation therebetween is constantly stored. When the deviation between the yarn balloon shape and the standard shape is enlarged to or beyond a certain value, it is judged as time for traveler replacement, and then warning is denoted or “traveler replacement” is displayed on the display 40. The deviation value as criterion of judgment is obtained by test or  experience.<br>
As to the state of the cotton fly which is accumulated at the clearer roller of the draft part 7, the image of the draft part 7 which is shot during appropriate spinning operation is set as standard data in advance, the images of clearer roller which is shot during the movement of the cleaning device 2 for patrol is compared with the standard data to recognize the variation of state of cotton fly accumulation. In this case, the limit of the variation is set in<br>
-15-<br><br>
advance. If the variation is enlarged to or beyond the limit, it is judged as time for cleaning the clearer roller, and “cleaning” is displayed on the display 40 for notifying necessity of cleaning to the operator.<br>
Alternatively, a time to require cleaning may be set as standard data<br>
in advance. If fleece is accidentally wound around the clearer roller, significant change appears at the clearer roller even before the set cleaning time has come. This change is judged as abnormal state, not as time for cleaning. Then, a warning signal is set up for coping with the emergency, or according to circumstances a signal for stopping the operation of the ring spinning machine is sent out, thereby promptly responding to trouble.<br>
As to the installation of a wrong element, elements such as a clearer roller are different in color or size depending on specification of spinning. Thus, when new spinning specification is set, color and size of an element such as a clearer roller which is suitable for the specification are set as standard data in advance. The images, such as the images of the clearer roller, which are shot during the movement of the cleaning device 2 for patrol, are compared with the standard data thereby to recognize at an early stage that a wrong element is installed or an element is missing. As a result, the situation is promptly responded to.<br>
-16-<br><br>
The following will describe the way of using the shot data of the ring spinning machine, the stored shot data and the analysis data obtained from the shot data through the display 40.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a menu screen displayed on the display 40. There are<br>
real-time image, record reservation, image play and report as menu items. The “real-time image” is clicked on to display the machine numbers 001....N of the ring spinning machines in a real-time image machine selection screen as shown in FIG. 5. All of the machine numbers can be displayed by operation of a scroll button 41 or 42. The machine number to be checked, for example, 001, is selected and a display button is clicked on to display a real-time image screen as shown in FIG. 6. It is noted that a plurality of the machine numbers can be selected and the display button is clicked to display a plurality of windows in the screen shown in FIG. 6. In this case, the screen containing the similar content as that in FIG. 6 is displayed in each window per a selected machine number.<br>
The screen of FIG. 6 shows that produced percentage of bundle is<br>
60% for the machine number 001 selected in FIG. 5, and image screens of the right side R and left side L of the ring spinning machine are displayed in real time therein. In addition, movement buttons, record buttons and a shutter button are displayed in the screen in FIG. 6. While watching the image<br>
-17-<br><br>
Screens, the operator operates the movement buttons to move and stop the cleaning device 2. And then, the operator can check conditions of the ring spinning machine by watching the image screens of the right side R and the left side L, thereby judging abnormality.<br>
Furthermore, the images which are shot during the movement of cleaning device 2 and during the stop thereof at a specific spinning unit can be recorded as moving images by operation of the record buttons. Still images at specific location can be recorded by operation of the shutter button. 10 If a plurality of windows are displayed in the screen in FIG. 6, recording operation can be performed per window. It is noted that these recorded images can be viewed by clicking on the image play that is indicated as the menu item in FIG. 4.<br>
In the menu screen in FIG. 4, the “record reservation” is clicked on to<br>
display a record reservation list screen as shown in FIG. 7. In the screen of FIG. 7, “(new reservation)”, reservation numbers 0001, 0002 and 0003 that have been previously set, information on valid/invalid of reservation, reservation titles 43, an edit button and a delete button are displayed. If there are any other reservations, the machine numbers and the associated items can be displayed by operation of scroll buttons 44 and 45. It is noted that each reservation is edited or deleted by selecting the reservation number and<br>
-18-<br><br>
clicking on the edit button or the delete button. “(New reservation)” is selected and the edit button is clicked on to make a new reservation.<br>
When changing the content of the reservation number 0001whose reservation is invalid in FIG. 7, the reservation number 0001 is selected and the edit button is clicked on to display a record reservation edit screen as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
In the screen of FIG. 8, editing is performed as follows. A title to be displayed at the reservation title 43 in FIG. 7, for example, “fixed point image” ,is input at “a. title” field. Valid is selected at “b. execution” field.

By setting the above fields, a report concerning yarn breakage of the designated machine is prepared and stored based on the shot data of each machine previously shot and the analysis data obtained from the shot data.<br>
The above-described preferred embodiment of the present invention provides the following advantageous effects.<br>
-23-<br><br>
(1) Cleaning timing and cleaning cycle can be reasonably judged by periodically shooting or taking images of the state of cotton fly accumulation, such as images of the draft part 7, and analyzing them. Furthermore, it is possible to denote warning when abnormality is judged.<br>
(2) Abrasion state of and replacement time for the traveler can be reasonably judged by periodically shooting or taking images of the state of yarn balloon during winding of yarn, analyzing and assessing them.<br>
 (3) The type of an element such as a clearer roller and whether or not an element is installed can be checked by taking a glance at the shot data of the ring spinning machine or the shot images thereof, thereby finding at an early stage that an element is wrongly installed or missing.<br>
(4) Whether or not yarn breaks is detected by the shot data of the winding section. Unlike conventional machines, it is not necessary to provide to each spinning unit a yarn breakage sensor for detecting yarn breakage, so that the structure around the spindle 3 is made simpler.<br>
(5) Accurate observation and judgment concerning the ring spinning machine can be performed by minutely shooting or taking images of operational state during trial spinning, for example, when new fiber is set or a<br>
-24-<br><br>
new element is installed, and obtaining analysis data such as the number of yarn breakage from the shot data. Furthermore, fewer personnel is needed for recording data during the trial spinning.<br>
(6) The cameras 26 through 28 are provided to the cleaning device 2 installed for each ring spinning machine. When a plurality of ring spinning machines becomes state to be monitored (e.g. at restart of spinning after bobbin replacement) at the same time, each of the plurality of machines can be shot at the same time.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned first and second embodiments, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims, as exemplified below.<br>
In the above-described preferred embodiment, the cameras 26 through 28 are connected to the main control device 36 through the machine control devices 29 through 31 as shown in FIG. 3. Alternatively, the cameras 26 through 28 may be directly connected to the main control device 36 by way of connecting means such as local area network or the like.<br>
The cameras 26 through 28 may be connected to only the machine control devices 29 through 31, and the machine control devices 29 through 31<br>
-25-<br><br>
may be adapted to serve as the main control device 36 to store the shot data and the analysis data and make various settings such as shooting timing and shooting location.<br>
Each of the cameras 26 through 28 may include a control device such as memory, a LCD (liquid crystal display) panel and an input-output device such as switch and may be adapted to store the shot data and the analysis data and make various settings such as shooting timing and shooting location.<br>
The cameras 26 through 28 may be connected to the machine control devices 29 through 31 by way of connecting means such as local area network or the like. A display and an input-output device may be provided in each of the machine control devices 29 through 31 and may be used for referring to the shot data and the analysis data stored in the cameras 26 through 28 and making various settings described in the preferred embodiment.<br>
In the above-described preferred embodiment, location of each<br>
spinning unit is recognized by the spindle numbers R01 to RN marked on the front face of the ring rail 22 as shown in FIG. 2. Alternatively, the location of each spinning unit may be recognized by calculating the location of the<br>
-26-<br><br>
cleaning device 2 based on rotation speed, operating time and rotation pulse of the drive motor 19 of the cleaning device 2. And then, the spindle number of the recognized spinning unit may be assigned to the shot data, so that the spindle number of the spinning unit in the shot data can be visually recognized and analyzed without marking the spindle numbers on the front face of the ring rail 22. Alternatively, a dog may be provided at each spinning unit and detected by a sensor provided at the cleaning device 2 thereby to recognize each spinning unit.<br>
Various data such as shooting date or shooting location, which are to<br>
be assigned to the shot data, may be assigned by the machine control devices 29 through 31 after sending the shot data to the machine control devices 29 through 31.<br>
A drive mechanism may be connected to the cameras 26 through 28<br>
and operated according to a command signal from the main control device 36 or the machine control devices 29 through 31 for moving the cameras 26 through 28 to various shooting locations in the ring spinning machine. In this case, only one camera may shoot a plurality of locations.<br>
The traveling body of the present invention is not limited to the cleaning device 2 described in the preferred embodiment and may be a<br>
-27-<br><br>
working vehicle such as a roving bobbin carrier, a roving bobbing exchanger or a yarn piecing device, or a dedicated vehicle for shooting or taking images of a spinning machines.<br>
The motion timing of shooting by the cameras 26 through 28 may be set at constant time intervals or at irregular time intervals.<br>
The shot data and the analysis data may be printed out by a printer and stored as printed matter.<br>
In the above-described preferred embodiment, the cameras are provided so as to face toward the roving supply section, the draft part and the winding section, respectively. Alternatively, according to control purpose a camera may be provided so as to face toward only a part of them.<br>
In addition to a ring spinning machine, the present invention may be applied to other spinning machines such as a ring twisting machine, a drawing-twisting machine and a roving machine.<br>
Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein but may be modified.<br>
