SPECIFICATION<br>
3,4-DIHYDROBENZOXAZINE COMPOUNDS AND INHIBITORS OF VANILLOID RECEPTOR SUBTYPE 1 (VRl) ACTIVITY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 3,4-dihydrobenzoxazine compound having an inhibitory effect on vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) activity and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and a method for treating and/or preventing diseases to which the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) activity is involved, such as pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, etc., particularly pain.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Capsaicin, which is the main ingredient of red pepper, is a pungency causing ingredient as well as a pain producing substance. It has been reported that many nociceptive nerves, particularly unmyelinated C fibers have capsaicin sensitivity and it is known that C fibers will selectively drop out when capsaicin is administered to an infant rodent. It has been also reported that<br>
 <br>
there are many sites of action for capsaicin distributed in the skin, cornea, and oral mucosa, and the distribution thereof is also observed in the muscles, joints and internal organs, particularly in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system and bladder urinary tract system, and it is important for activation of sensory nerve.  In addition, capsaicin sensitivity is also observed in the nerves of the preoptic area of the thalamus, and involvement in the regulation of body temperature is presumed.  Depolarization by inflow of Na'^ and Ca^"^ by capsaicin administration is observed in the nociceptive nerves and discharge of glutamic acid and neuropeptides (mainly Substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) from the center side end of the primary afferent fiber of the spinal dorsal horn is resulted. Now that specific binding activity of resiniferatoxin (RTX) which brings about similar effects to that of capsaicin has been observed, and that capsazepine has been revealed as a competitive inhibitor, liposoluble capsaicin is considered to act on receptor protein (see Szallasi A, Blumberg PM. (1999) Pharmacol. Rev. 51, 159-212 (Non-Patent Document 1)).<br>
The capsaicin receptor gene was cloned in 1997 (see, for example, Caterina MJ, Schumacher MA Tominaga M, Posen TA, Levine JD, Julius D. (1997) Nature 389, 816-824 (Non-Patent Document 2) ) . It was presumed from its amino acid sequence that it was an ion channel having a six-<br>
 <br>
transmembrane domain.  Since capsaicin has a vanillyl group in the structure, it is generically referred to as vanilloids along with its analogs such as RTX, and the cloned receptor was named vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (hereinafter referred to as VR 1; This VRl may be also referred to as TRPVl (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)).  Then, electrophysiological functional analysis using the patch clamping method has been performed by making oocytes of Xenopus laevis and human derived cultured cells to express VRl, and it has been revealed that VRl is directly activated by capsaicin, without mediated by an intracellular second messenger (see, for example, Caterina MJ, Schumacher MA Tominaga M, Posen TA, Levine JD, Julius D. (1997) Nature 389, 816-824 (Non-Patent Document 2)), and that VRl is a non-selective cation ion channel having high Ca^"^ permeability with an outward rectification property (see, for example, Premkumar LS, Agarwal S, Steffen D. (2002) J. Physiol. 545, 107-117 (Non-Patent Document 3)).<br>
Although capsaicin is a pain causing substance, it is used as an analgesic agent to mitigate pain in diabetic neuropathy or rheumatic neurosis (see, for example, Szallasi A, Blumberg PM. (1999) Pharmacol. Rev. 51, 159-212 (Non-Patent Document 1)).  It is understood that such mitigation is resulted from a phenomenon that the sensory nerve end exposed to capsaicin stops answering to pain stimulus, that is, desensitization.<br>
 <br>
Although it is considered that the desensitization mechanism of VRl involves Ca""^-mediated regulation, regulation depending on potential, activity control of VRl by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, etc., many points remain unclear.<br>
As well as capsaicin, heat and acid also cause pain and it is known that the capsaicin sensitive nociceptive nerves respond to two or more types of stimulation.  It was found that VRl was directly activated by not only<br>
capsaicin but heat stimulation of 43°C or more (see, for example, Yang D, Gereau RW 4th. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22, 6388-6393 (Non-Patent Document 4)).  The temperature of 43°C is mostly in agreement with the temperature threshold which causes a pain in humans and animals, suggesting that VRl participates in nociceptive heat stimulation receptance.<br>
Acidification occurs in an organ in the case of inflammation or ischemia and it is known to cause or enhance pain (see, for example, Bevan S, Geppetti P. (1994) Trends Neurosci. 17, 509-512 (Non-Patent Document 5)) . It has turned out that when the pH outside cells is reduced within the limits of the acidification which takes place in the case of an organ lesion, VRl can be directly activated by the acidification (proton) alone, and it is surmised that VRl is the actual molecule which receives stimulation by acidification in an organ which takes place in the case of inflammation or ischemia (see.<br>
 <br>
for example, Yang D, Gereau RW 4th. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22, 6388-6393 {Non-Patent Document 4)).<br>
Immunohistological analysis using a specific antibody has confirmed that the number of unmyelinated C fibers expressing VRl increases in an inflamed region as compared in a normal region (see, for example, Carlton SM, Coggeshall RE. (2001) Neurosci. Lett. 310, 53-56 (Non-Patent Document 6) ) .  The enhancement of VRl expression in submucosal plexus has been actually observed in human inflammatory bowel disease (see, for example, Yiangou Y, Facer P, Dyer NH, Chan CL, Knowles C, Williams NS, Anand P. (2001) Lancet 357, 1338-1339 (Non-Patent Document 7)). Such an increase in the amount of VRl expression causes peripheral sensitization in an inflamed organ and presumably contributes to duration of inflammatory hyperalgesia.<br>
It has been also reported that extracellular ATP, bradykinin and a neuro growth factor which are inflammation related substances increase VRl activity (see, for example, Tominaga M, Wada M, Masu M. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98, 6951-6956 (Non-Patent Document 8); Shu X, Mendell LM. (1999) Neurosci. Lett. 274, 159-162 (Non-Patent Document 9); Chuang HH, Prescott ED, Kong H, Shields S, Jordt SE, Basbaum AI, Chao, MV, Julius D. (2001) Nature 411, 957-962 (Non-Patent Document 10); and Sugiura T, Tominaga M, Katsuya H, Mizumura K. (2002) J. Neurophyslol. 88. 544-548 (Non-Patent Document<br>
 <br>
11)) and it is said to be a fact without doubt that VRl involves in pain and hypersensitivity of pain including those caused by inflammation (see, for example, Numazaki M, Tominaga M (2003) Biochemistry 75, 359-371 (Non-Patent Document 12)).<br>
The sensory nerve cells in a VRl-deficient mouse responded to none of capsaicin, proton and heat stimulation.  It is also reported that in action analysis, VRl-deficient mouse does not show the pain reaction following capsaicin administration, and sensitivity to heat stimulation decreases and inflammatory hyperalgesia is not observed (see, for example, Caterina MJ, Leffler A, Malmberg AB, Martin WJ, Trafton J, Peterson-Zeitz KR, Koltzenburg M, Basbaum AI, Julius D. (2000) Science 288, 306-313 (Non-Patent Document 13) and Davis LB, Gray J, Gunthorpe MJ et al. (2000) Nature 405, 183-187 (Non-Patent Document 14)).  Thus, it has been confirmed also on an individual level from the analysis of VRl-deficient mouse that VRl functions as a wide range pain stimulation receptor.<br>
Moreover, as for the relation between vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) and a disease, it has been reported already that a substance which inhibits VRl activity is useful as a therapeutical agent of various diseases.<br>
Particularly with regard to a therapeutical agent of pain, there is a report that capsazepine which is known<br>
 <br>
as a VRl antagonist has exhibited a significant analgesic effect in an animal model (see, for example, Ikeda Y, Ueno A, Naraba H, Oh-ishi S, (2001) Life Science 69, 2911-2919 (Non-Patent Document 15) ) , and use is expected as a new therapeutical agent of pain having an inhibitory effect of VRl activity.<br>
It has been confirmed with regard to bladder hyperstrain type frequent urination and urinary incontinence that the bladder contraction function of VRl-deficient mouse decreases and there is a report that a compound having a capsaicin-like pharmacological mechanism or a compound having an inhibitory action on VRl, i.e., a compound inhibiting vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) activity is useful for improving bladder function, for example, as a therapeutical agent of frequent urination, urinary incontinence, etc (see, for example, (2002) Nat. Neurosci. 5, 856-860 (Non-Patent Document 16)).<br>
In addition, another reference reports that a substance having an inhibitory effect to the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl), particularly antagonist of VRl receptor is useful for preventing and treating diseases related to VRl activity, particularly urgent urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, neuropathy, hyperalgesia, nerve damage, ischemic symptom, neurodegenerative.<br>
 <br>
cerebral apoplexy, incontinence, and inflammatory disease (see, for example, JP 2003-192673 (Patent Document 1)).<br>
Furthermore, it is also known that diseases relevant to the vanilloid receptor activity may include pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraine, joint pain, neuropathy, nerve damage, diabetic nervous disease, neurodegenerative disease, neurogenic skin disorder, cerebral apoplexy, bladder hypersensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, abnormalities in respiratory organs such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stimulation of skin, eye or mucosa, fever, stomach or duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory disease, etc (see, for example, JP 2004-506714 T2 (Patent Document 2)).<br>
Accordingly, it can be said that substances having vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) antagonistic activity is useful as a therapeutic agent for conditions in which C fibers participates, for example, not to mention pruritus, allergic and allergic rhinitis, overactive bladder type frequent urination and urinary incontinence, apoplexy, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory ailment such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dermatitis, mucositis, stomach and duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. but also pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraine, joint pain, neuropathy, nerve damage, diabetic nervous disease, neurodegenerative disease, rheumatoid<br>
 <br>
arthritis pain, neuralgia, neuropathy, hyperalgesia, neurogenic skin disorder, apoplexy, overweight, urgent urinary incontinence, ischemic symptom and an inflammatory disease, etc.<br>
Next, compounds considered to relatively resemble the known vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) antagonist and the compound of present invention are described.<br>

The urea-type compound represented by the following general formula [E] is disclosed in WO03/053945 as a compound exhibiting antagonism to VRl (Patent Document 6).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
As an analgesic agent, narcotic analgesics (morphine etc.)/ nonnarcotic analgesics (NSAID (nonsteroidal anti¬inflammatory drug)), etc. are mainly used now. However, use of narcotic analgesics is severely restricted due to development of resistance/dependency and other serious side effects. It is known well other that an upper gastrointestinal tract disorder and a liver disorder frequently occur during long-term administration of<br>
 <br>
nonnarcotic analgesics, and analgesic agent with a few side effects with higher analgesic effect is eagerly desired.  Furthermore, as for diabetes-induced neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia, no effective analgesic agent has been found yet and development of an effective analgesic agent thereof is also expected.<br>
Capsaicin-like compounds which act on VRl are considered to develop the analgesic effect based on a pharmacological mechanism completely different from those of existing analgesic agents (block of capsaicin-sensitive nerves), and the efficacy is greatly expected as a therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain and the pain which originates in various conditions such as rheumatic arthritis for which the existing analgesic agents are not effective.<br>
The fact that the final target of various inflammation related substances is VRl suggests possibility that an agent which acts on VRl is effective for various inflammatory pains and interstitial cystitis and its efficacy is greatly expected as an analgesic agent which replaces the existing analgesic agents.<br>
Therefore, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a new analgesic agent based on the pharmacological mechanism completely different from those of existing analgesic agents (block of capsaicin-<br>
 <br>
sensitive nerves), i.e., VRl activity inhibitor and to provide a novel compound for the same.<br>
More specifically, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a VRl activity inhibitor excellent in not only inhibitory activity on VRl but also absorbability and sustainability which is more likely to be practically used.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for treating and/or preventing diseases to which the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VRl) activity is involved, such as pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, etc., particularly pain. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
As a result of intensive study for developing an analgesic agent based on new action mechanism which will replace conventional analgesic agents such as nonnarcotic analgesics, pyrazolone analgesics, non-pyrazolone analgesics and NSAIDs, the present inventors have found out a 3,4-dihydrobenzoxazine compound which has excellent inhibitory activity on VRl action and has more excellent absorbability and more excellent sustainability, and completed the present invention.

Test Example<br>
The assay for evaluation of VRl inhibition by the compounds of the present invention will be described below.<br>
The assay was intended to evaluate in vitro an inhibitory effect on Ca^"^ entry in cells caused by proton, one of the VRl agonists (Test Example [1]), a metabolic stability test in liver S9 (Test Example [2]), an in-vitro membrane permeability test (Test Example [3]) and a stability test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution (Test Example [4]), using the compound of the present invention and compounds of Comparative Examples shown in Table 3 below.

<br>
Test Example [1]: inhibition of Ca^"^ entry in cells;<br>
An inhibitory effect on VRl activity was evaluated by measuring Ca^"^ uptake in cells.<br>
Rat glioma (C6BU1) cells stably expressing human VRl were suspended in 20 mM MES buffer (at pH 6.8, contg. 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonate (referred to as MES hereinafter), 115 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 14 mM D-glucose) to make a cell density of 1x10® cells/mL. A fluorescent dye, Fura 2-AM solution (Dojindo Corporate, Cat. No. 343-05401) was added to the suspension to make a 5 fiM concentration thereof.  Further, Pluronic F-127 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Cat. No. P6866) was added to make a 0.1% content thereof. Then, the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.  The cells were harvested and washed two times with 20 mM MES buffer. The cells were suspended again to make a cell density of 5x10^ cells/mL. A 500-|xL portion of the suspension was taken with a cuvette (MC MEDICAL, INC., Cat. No. SSR3121), to which 10 ^L of 20 mM MES buffer containing 250 mM CaCl2 was added to incorporate Ca^"^ into the cells. At the<br>
same time, 5 ^L of a test compound solution (in a range of 100 |uM to 10 nM in DMSO) was also added to provide a final concentration thereof in a range of 1 )JM to 0.1 nM. Alternatively, 5 /iL of DMSO was added as   control to<br>
 <br>
provide a final concentration of 1% DMSO. The suspension was set in an intracellular ionometer (CAF-110; JASCO) 10 min after those additions.  The cells were stimulated<br>
with protons by addition of 50 fj.L of 20 mM MES buffer at pH 1.1 to the suspension to set its pH at 5.7.  The activity of the test compound was determined as a difference between the minimum of fluorescence intensity before agonist stimulation and its maximum after the stimulation. The value of IC50 was derived from percentage of inhibition by the test compound compared with the control.<br>
Test Example [2] metabolic stability test in liver S9;<br>
Human liver S9 (final concentration: 2 mg protein/mL) was suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate<br>
buffer (at pH 7.4, which contained p-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate: 1.3 mM, D-glucose-6-phosphate: 3.3 mMy magnesium chloride: 3.3 mM and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 0.45 U/mL) and further mixed with the test compound dissolved in DMSO. The mixture<br>
was incubated at 37°C for 0 and 60 minutes and then<br>
supplemented with acetonitrile containing formic acid (final concentration 0.1%). The test compound (uncharged) in a supernatant after centrifugation was<br>
measured using high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). A remaining<br>
 <br>
ratio(%) was calculated from the obtained measurement value according to the following equation: Remaining ratio{%)=(amount of test compound after 60 minutes of incubation/amount of test compound on 0 minute of incubation)xlOO<br>
Test Example [3] in-vitro membrane permeability test;<br>
10 mM DMSO solution of the test compound was diluted with Hanks buffer (pH 6.5) to 25 |a.M to make a test compound solution.  300 \xL  of Apical buffer (Hanks buffer<br>
(pH 6.5)) and 1 mL of Basolateral buffer (4.5 % BSA-containing Hanks buffer (pH 7.4)) were added to the apical side (mucosal side) and the basolateral side<br>
(serosal side), respectively, of Caco2 cells (cells cultured for 6 days after seeding) seeded onto a plate for permeability test (BIOCOAT HTS Caco2 Assay system: BD Biosciences), and preincubated at 37°C for 20 minutes, followed by measurement of a transepithelial electrical resistance value. Each buffer on the apical side and<br>
basolateral side was removed by aspiration. Then, 300 }iL of the test compound solution and 1 mL of Basolateral buffer were added to the apical side and the basolateral side, respectively, and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, with stirring at 60 rpm. Then, sampling was performed from each of the apical side and the basolateral side, and the sample was supplemented with acetonitrile and centrifuged. The test compound (uncharged) in the<br>
 <br>
supernatant was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS: Quantum, Thermo Quest).<br>
A membrane permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated according to the following^equation:<br>
Papp (cm/sec.)=(dx/dt)/(AxCo)<br>
(wherein dx is the amount of the test compound<br>
(uncharged) on the basolateral side after incubation, dt<br>
is an incubation time, A is the surface area of the cell<br>
membrane, and Co is the initial concentration of the test<br>
compound on the apical side.)<br>
Test Example [4] stability test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution;<br>
The test compound was dissolved .in a mixed solution of CH3CN and Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution (volume ratio 3:7) and adjusted in a vial for HPLC to a concentration of 0.05 mM. The test compound was measured by HPLC at 40°C after 0 and 8 hours. The measurement value on 0 hour was defined as 100% to determine the remaining retio of the test compound after 8 hours.<br>
The "Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution" here represents a solution in which 21 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to 6 g of sodium chloride and further adjusted to 3 L with distilled water.<br>

[1] Discussion about test result of inhibitory effect on Ca^"" entry in cells (Test Example [1]);<br>
The values of IC50 of the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 0.024 nM, 0.038 nM, 0.24 nM, 0.019 nM, 0.66 nM, 0.15 nM, 0.14 nM, 0.038 nM, 0.54 nM and 0.69 nM, respectively, and the average value of IC50 of these ten compounds was 0.25 nM.<br>
Particularly the compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-2, 1-4 and 1-8 had values of IC50 of 0.024, 0.038, 0.019 and 0.038, respectively, and had an excellent inhibitory effect on VRl activity.<br>
On the other hand, the values of IC50 of the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 3 nM, 1.3 nM, 18 nM, 5.2 nM, 42.0 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.4 nM, 7 nM, 0.12 nM, 0.04 nM, 0.3 6 nM, 0.03 nM and 0.12 nM, respectively, and the average value of IC50 of these thirteen compounds of Comparative Examples was 5.99 nM.<br>
As described above, the compound of the present invention had inhibitory activity about 24 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average values of IC50.<br>
 <br>
[2] Discussion about result of metabolic stability test in human liver S9 (Test Example [2]);<br>
The human .liver S9 remaining ratios of the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 90.8%, 65.3%, 59.6%, 39.7%, 82.2%, 91.8%, 50.4%, 91.5%, 77.3% and 92.2%, respectively, and the average human liver S9 remaining ratio of these ten compounds was 74%.*<br>
Particularly the compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-6, 1-8 and 1-10 had 90% or higher remaining ratios and exhibited remarkably high remaining ratios, i.e., remarkably high metabolic stability in liver S9.  Therefore, these compounds will be useful as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect.<br>
On the other hand, the human liver S9 remaining ratio of the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 86.3%, 90.1%, 89.4%, 92.5%, 64.9%, 77.3%, 55.1%, 62.9%, 65.9%, 82.3%, 66.7%, 54.5% and 91.3%, respectively, and the average remaining ratio of these thirteen compounds of Comparative Examples was 75%.<br>
[3] Discussion about result of in-vitro membrane permeability test (Test Example [3]);<br>
 <br>
The in-vitro membrane permeability of the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] was, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 8.59xl0"^ 20.96x10"°, 26.93xl0•"^ 30.25xl0"^ 38.07xl0"^ 37.53xlO-S 37.94xl0-^ 13.61xl0"S 50.36x10"^ and 39.22x10"^, respectively, in terms of the Papp values (cm/sec.)/ and the average Papp value (cm/sec.) of these ten compounds was 30.35x10"^.<br>
Particularly the compounds of Examples 1-2 to 1-10 had 10x10"^ (cm/sec.) or more membrane permeability and exhibited remarkably high membrane permeability. Therefore, these compounds have exceedingly excellent properties as drugs because they have not only excellent values of IC50 but also high absorbability which is a must for being practically used as a drug.<br>
On the other hand, the Papp values (cm/sec.) of the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 27.1xl0"^ 24.2xlO-S 25.6xl0'^ 5.3x10"^ 7.9xl0~^ 21.1xl0~^ 18.2xl0'^ 43.1xlO"S 19.4xlO"S 6.7x10" S 40.3xl0"S 10.4x10"^ and 28.6xl0"S respectively, and the average Papp value (cm/sec.) of these thirteen<br>
compounds of Comparative Examples was 21.38x10"^.<br>
As described above, the compound of the present invention had membrane permeability about 1.4 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average Papp values.<br>
 <br>
[4] Discussion about result of stability test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution (Test Example [4]);<br>
In the stability test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution, the remaining ratios of the compounds of Examples 1-6 and 1-8 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were 100 and 101%, respectively. On the other hand, the remaining ratio of the compound of Comparative Example 13 was 62.1%.<br>
Since it is assumed that the Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution has pH equal to that of gastric acid, it is generally known that stability therein suggests stability in gastric juice.<br>
Therefore, these compounds, as compared with the compound of Comparative Example 13, will be useful as drugs excellent in that they can be stable in gastric juice.<br>
[5] Summary; (1) Regarding value of IC50;<br>
According to the document (J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2003 Jul; 306 (1): 377-86), it is known that BCTC, which is known as a substance inhibiting VRl activity, has its inhibitory activity (value of IC50) of several nM. Moreover, we have also confirmed in our tests that the value of IC50 of BCTC is several nM.<br>
 <br>
All the values of IC50 of the compound of the present invention, specifically the compounds of the present Examples 1-1 to 1-10 are less than 1 nM.<br>
On the other hand, of the compounds of Comparative Examples, seven compounds of Comparative Examples 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 had values of IC50 less than 1 nM. However, these seven compounds of Comparative Examples were not necessarily satisfiable with all things considered, for such reasons as they had remaining ratiosi less than 80% in the metabolic stability test in liver S9 and/or Papp values less than 10x10"^ corresponding to membrane permeability or had inferior stability in gastric juice. (2) Regarding metabolic stability in human liver S9;<br>
Metabolic stability is one of important requirements for a drug, and those having 80% or higher metabolic stability are preferred.  The compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-6, 1-8 and 1-10 had 90% or higher remaining ratios and exhibited remarkably high remaining ratios, i.e., remarkably high metabolic stability in liver S9.<br>
On the other hand, the compounds of Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, etc. also exhibited excellent metabolic stability. However, the compounds of Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 had values of IC50 of 1 nM or higher and were not satisfiable in light of inhibitory activity. The compound of Comparative Example 10 had a Papp value of 6.7x10"^ and was not satisfiable<br>
 <br>
in light of membrane permeability. Moreover, the compound of Comparative Example 13 had inferior stability in gastric juice and was not necessarily satisfiable.<br>
(3)	Regarding result of membrane permeability test;<br>
Regarding membrane permeability, the compound of the present invention had membrane permeability about 1.4 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average Papp values, as described above. Particularly the compounds of Examples 1-4, l-5&gt; 1-6, 1-7, 1-9 and 1-10 had high membrane permeability of 30x10"^ or more in terms of the Papp values.<br>
On the other hand, of the compounds of Comparative Examples, the compounds of Comparative Examples 8 and 11 had high membrane permeability.  However, the compound of Comparative Example 8 had a value of IC50 of 7 nM corresponding to inhibitory activity and was not satisfiable in light of inhibitory activity.  Moreover, the compound of Comparative Example 11 had a human liver S9 remaining ratio of 66.7% serving as an index of metabolic stability and was not necessarily satisfiable as a drug.<br>
(4)	Characteristics of compound of the present invention<br>
from the viewpoint of chemical structure;<br>
When the compound of Comparative Example 11 and the compound of Example 1-2 are compared, they are different in that the former has only one fluorine atom in the phenyl group whereas the latter has two fluorine atoms.<br>
 <br>
The latter has the value of IC50 about 10 times higher than that of the former.<br>
When the compound of Comparative Example 8 and the compound of Example 1-6 are compared, they are different only in that the former has a trifluoromethyl group as a substituent for pyridine whereas the latter has a 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy group. ,The latter is improved in its liver S9 remaining ratio which is about 1.5 times that of the former and in its value of IC50 which is about 50 times that of the former.<br>
When the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9 and the compound of Example 1-8 are compared, the compound of Example 1-8 which has two fluorine atoms and one 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy group as substituents for a phenyl group is different from the others in that the compound of Comparative Example 7 has only one trifluoromethyl group and in that the compound of Comparative Example 9 merely has one fluorine atom and one trifluoromethyl group. However, the compound of Example 1-8 is improved in its liver S9 remaining ratio which is about 1.4 to 1.7 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9 and in its value of IC50 which is about 3 to 11 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9.<br>
When the compound of Comparative Example 13 and the compound of Example 1-1 are compared, they are different in that the former has only one fluorine atom in the<br>
 <br>
phenyl group whereas the latter has two fluorine atoms. The latter has the value of IC50 about 5 times higher than that of the former.  This was a result which was not expectable even by those skilled in the art.<br>
The compound represented by the general formula [1], particularly the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 are compounds having excellent inhibitory activity on VRl as well as excellent metabolic stability in liver S9 and/or high membrane permeability.<br>
Therefore, the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound represented by the general formula [1] not only are useful as drugs remarkably excellent in effectiveness as VRl activity inhibitors but also will be useful as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect as well as in that they can have high absorbability.<br>
Therefore, these compounds not only are useful as drugs remarkably excellent in effectiveness as VRl activity inhibitors but also are expected to be practically used as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect as well as in that they can have high absorbability.<br>
