Process variant (A) can be carried out using conventional procedures. It is conveniently, carried out in an inert organic solvent, preferably a polar solvent such as dioxan or N-methylpyrrolidone. The reaction temperature is conveniently from 50 to 250°C, preferably from 100 to 150°C. The reaction may be catalysed by a strong acid, a tertiary base or, preferably, metal ions such as Ag, Cu, Li, Ni, Zn, La, Yb or Sn. The reaction is conveniently carried out using 1 to 5 equivalents, for example 1 to 3 equivalents, of the compound of formula VI, per equivalent of the compound of formula V.<br>
Compounds of formulae V and VI are known or may be prepared by methods analogous to those used for preparation of the known compounds. Thus compounds of formula V may be prepared, for example, as described in W097/16452 or as described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
Process variant (B) may be carried out by conventional methods for ester cleavage, for example using conventional acid- or base- catalysed hydrolysis, or analogously as described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>

Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt form, and vice versa, in a conventional manner. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallization.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be recovered from the reaction mixture and purified in a conventional manner. Isomer mixtures can be separated into individual isomers, e.g. enantiomers, in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free or salt form are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I in free or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "agents of the invention", inhibit the activity of the tyrosine protein kinase syk, which is an activator of pro-inflammatory cells driving an allergic response. This inhibitory property of the agents of the invention can be demonstrated in the following assay:<br>
In this assay the effect of an agent of the invention on the phosphorylation of a peptide by syk kinase is determined. The phosphate is transferred from the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the biotin-modified peptide biotin-EDPDYEWPSA (available from Genosys) which is a known specific substrate for syk. When 33P-phosphorylated peptide binds to streptavidin-polyvinyltoluene (PVT) Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) beads (available from Amersham), the emitted fi-particles excite the fluorophore in the beads and produce light. Free ^-ATP in solution does not excite the fluorophore because the beads are separated from solution by flotation and so it is not in close proximity to the beads. The scintillation count is therefore a measure of the extent to which the test compound inhibits phosphorylation by syk kinase.<br>
To the wells of an Optiplate (Canberra Packard) are added (i) the compound under test in DMSO/distilled water (10|il), (ii) 20ui of a composition formed by mixing ImM biotin-EDPDYEWPSA (5.5ul), 300uM ATP (18.3 ul), and ^-ATP in sufficient amount to add 0.1u,Ci ^-ATP per well (l.lul on the day of production) and making up the volume to 2.2ml with a buffer (Buffer A) prepared by dissolving tris-base (0.36g) in distilled water (80ml), adjusting the pH to 7.5 with 1M hydrochloric acid, adding 1M aqueous MgCfe (1.5ml), 50mM aqueous sodium orthovanadate (30u.l) and 1M aqueous dithiothrietol (150ul), and making the volume up to 120 ml with distilled water, (iii) 0.5% w/v syk<br>
1?<br><br>
kinase in Buffer A (20ul). The plate is incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with shaking, the reaction is then terminated by addition to all wells of 150 uj of a mixture prepared by reconstituting 500mg Streptavidin-PVT SPA beads in 373 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 673.6g cesium chloride, 20ml 0.5M EDTA and 27.5mg ATP (disodium salt) per litre. The plate is again incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with shaking, then sealed using Top Seal-S (Canberra Packard) according to the manufacturer's insturctions and left to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. The resulting scintillations are counted using a Packard TopCount, each well being counted for 1 minute.<br>
The procedure is repeated for different concentrations of test compound selected to cover the range of 0% to 100% inhibition and the concentration at which 50% inhibition of syk kinase phosphorylation occurs (IC50) for each compound is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the Examples hereinbelow have IC50 values of the order of luM or less in the above assay. For instance, the compounds of Examples 1 to 7 hereinbelow have IQo values of 3nM, 4nM, 5nM, 5nM, 9nM, lOnM and lOnM respectively, the compounds of Examples 102 to 104 have IC50 values of 5nM, 2nM and 3.6nM respectively and the compunds of Examples 138, 141, 170, 172, 188 and 201 have IC50 values of 14nM, 4.5nM, lOnM, 6nM, 5nM and 5nM respectively.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of syk kinase, and their suppression of IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells, the agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of conditions which are mediated by syk kinase, particularly inflammatory or allergic conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, the agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
IS<br><br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti¬inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or CO AD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g. eosinophilia, in particular eosinophil related disorders of the airways (e.g. involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues) including hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs as well as, for example, eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic (in particular metazoan) infestation (including tropical eosinophilia), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa  (including Churg-<br><br>
Strauss syndrome), eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction.<br>
Agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin, for example psoriasis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, erythema multiforma, dermatitis herpetiformis, scleroderma, vitiligo, hypersensitivity angiitis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, pemphisus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and other inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin.<br>
Agents of the invention may also be used for the treatment of other diseases or conditions, in particular diseases or conditions having an inflammatory component, for example, treatment of diseases and conditions of the eye such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and vernal conjunctivitis, diseases affecting the nose including allergic rhinitis, and inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<br>
The effectiveness of an agent of the invention in inhibiting inflammatory conditions, for example in inflammatory airways diseases, may be demonstrated in an animal model, e.g. a mouse or rat model, of airways inflammation or other inflammatory conditions, for example as described by Szarka et al, J. Immunol. Methods (1997) 202:49-57; Renzi et al, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. (1993) 148:932-939; Tsuyuki et al., J. Clin. Invest. (1995) 96:2924-2931; and Cernadas et al (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:1-8.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in conjunction with anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. An agent of the invention may be mixed with the anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug. Such anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids, in particular glucocorticosteroids such as budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone or mometasone, and dopamine receptor agonists such as cabergoline, bromocriptine or ropinirole. Such bronchodilatory drugs include anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, in particular ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. Combinations of agents of the invention and steroids may be used, for example, in the treatment of COPD or, particularly, asthma. Combinations of agents of the invention and<br>
2o<br><br>
anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents or dopamine receptor agonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the invention also provides a method for the treatment of a condition mediated by syk kinase, for example an inflammatory or allergic condition, particularly an inflammatory or obstructive airways disease, which comprises administering to a subject, particularly a human subject, in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I in a free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form as hereinbefore described. In another aspect the invention provides a compound of formula I, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, as hereinbefore described for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition mediated by syk kinase.<br>
The agents of the invention may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule; parenterally, for example intravenously; by inhalation, for example in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways disease; intranasally, for example in the treatment of allergic rhinitis; topically to the skin, for example in the treatment of atopic dermatitis; or rectally, for example in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. The composition may contain a co-therapeutic agent such as an anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug as hereinbefore described. Such compositions may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets and capsules. Formulations for topical administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches. Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizable formulations or dry powder formulations.<br>
The invention includes (A) an agent of the invention in inhalable form, e.g. in an aerosol or other atomisable composition or in inhalable particulate, e.g. micronised form, (B) an inhalable medicament comprising an agent of the invention in inhalable form; (C) a pharmaceutical product comprising such an agent of the invention in inhalable form in association with an inhalation device; and (D) an inhalation device containing an agent of the invention in inhalable form.<br><br>
Dosages of agents of the invention employed in practising the present invention will of course vary depending, for example, on the particular condition to be treated, the effect desired and the mode of administration. In general, suitable daily dosages for administration by inhalation are of the order of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg while for oral administration suitable daily doses are of the order of 1 to 1000 mg/kg.<br>
