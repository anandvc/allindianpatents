THE PATENTS ACT. 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[SECTION 10, RULE 13)<br>
"AN IMPROVED FLYER	FOR ROVING FRAME"<br>
ATE. INDUSTRIES PRIVATE LIMITED, AN INDIAN COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE AT A-19, CTS NO. 689, VEERA DESAI ROAD, ANDHERI (WEST), MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br><br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED -<br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved flyer   ..	for roving<br>
frame. More particularly, the present invention relates to a flyer assembly for automated roving frame.<br>
The present scenario of the textile industry involves a continuous need for automating operations in the textile mill; one of them is automated replacement of wound bobbin on the roving frame.<br>
Bobbin replacement can be effected by, for example, lowering of the bobbin rail together with the full bobbins, which extend upwardly from the bobbin supports thereon, thereby displacing the full bobbins out of the region of the flyers. The full bobbins are then gripped at their free core sleeve ends and withdrawn from the machine by a bobbin pick-up system, which is fed into the roving frame at the level of the bobbin rail.<br>
U.S. Patent N^T 4361005 (Zinser Textibnaschinen GmbH, 1982) discloses an assembly for winding up textile filaments incorporating a torsion spring in the hollow arm assembly of the flyer. The torsion spring acts upon the presser finger so as to keep a constant force upon the bobbin, continuously during the winding of the bobbin. This assembly has a disadvantage of the presence of a constant force during the winding of bobbin, which has an<br>
2- -<br><br>
increasingly negative effect on bobbin formation with increasing bobbin diameter and can be detrimental to the material being wound up. Besides, this arrangement calls for special requirement like spindle, pulleys, belts etc. in the construction of flyer, thereby increasing the cost of the assembly.<br>
U.S. Patent Np/5657623/(Zinser Textilmascbinen GmbH, 1997) describes flyers for roving frames, which have presser fingers, comprised of presser-finger rods or bars and presser-finger arms carrying presser-finger plates. The presser-finger rod or bar which lies outside a pivot axis, can be swung by an actuating lever transverse to the pivot axis so that the presser finger can be pivoted into an outwardly swung position and can be held in this position. The presser finger can be swung outwardly sufficiently so that the full bobbin can be removed from the rotating region on the flyer. This assembly bears certain disadvantages like during the initiation of the process, mere is a possibility of clashing of presser finger with the presser fingers of neighboring flyer mounted on the speed frame and moreover, there is always some delay by the time the presser finger paddle reaches the bobbin, leading to differential force during the winding of initial turns on the bobbin.<br>
German patent No. 197 27 799.3 describes an improved flyer for an automated roving frame incorporating a ball and a spring element on the flyer<br>
3- -<br><br>
arm, which is located between the presser finger and the flyer arm. As the system incorporates moving parts, the presence of dust and flying fibers entering the crevices is prominent This would certainly alter its performance and may get it jammed.<br>
The systems described above, apart from the aforesaid drawbacks suffer from other drawbacks like the_Jwear--and-Jejar of contacting parts. As a consequence, there may be a change in the location of the outwardly swung<br>
position of the presser finger during machine operation. In the event of any problem with functioning of the mechanisms, the piesser finger may not automatically swing back. Due to the close spacing of the flyers (diagonal spacing of the flyer pitch), especially in the case of large bobbin sizes, the presser fingers may engage in one another and thereby be damaged.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to obviate or mitigate these drawbacks by providing an improved system wherein the opening of the presser finger for enabling bobbin replacement is achieved and on release of<br>
tafiiMtfwSi"iiseiJsstE-irf ■^eflirtiifturr^Sai"<br><br>
the presser finger rod from the actuating lever, the presser finger automatically<br>

swings back to the preferred winding position.<br>
4- -<br><br>
The present invention relates to a flyer for a roving frame, haying at least one flyer arm interalia comprising a sfesser fingerjor contacting a bobbin during winding of said bobbin on said roving frame, and a non-contact device arranged to urge the presser finger from a first position towards a second position.<br>
More particularly, the present invention employs a device for generating a force which acts on a presser finger, for example, causing rotation around a pivot, without the need for a contact element that applies said force to the presser finger. In an especially preferred arrangement, the flyer comprises a device for generating a magnetic force. It is a particular advantage in the case of devices for generating magnetic force that such devices do not need to^ include the moving parts which may become worn or be susceptible to unpaired performance due to collection of dust, fibres or other debris during use.<br>
Advantageously, the first position is a position in which in use the presser finger will be spaced from the bobbin. Advantageously, the second position is an operational position in which the presser finger is in contact with the bobbin or in which the presser finger on rotation of the bobbin will automatically be brought into contact with the bobbin. It will be appreciated<br>
5- -<br><br>
that the precise location of the presser finger during operation will vary during the winding of each bobbin as the amount of wound filament or yarn increases and the second position is to be understood as including any location that may arise during winding. Advantageously the first position is a position in which a full bobbin can be removed and replaced by an empty bobbin.<br>
The term " non-contact device" used herein in relation to the devices arranged to urge the presser finger from the first position towards a second position is to be understood as referring to any device which is able to generate a force between the two members without direct contact between those members. Preferred non-contact devices will include a first element which is located on, or forms part of the structure of, the presser finger an a second element which can interact with the first element without contacting the said first element so as to generate a force on the said first element.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the flyer includes a non-contact device having a first element located-on or forming the part of the structure of, the presser finger an second element located on, or forming the part of structure thereof, the flyer arm the first and second elements being arranged to generate a repulsive force that acts on a presser finger via the first element. Preferably, the non-contact device is a magnet device.<br>
6- -<br><br>
Advantageously the magnet device comprises a first magnet on the presser finger and second magnet on*aid working flyer arm. Advantageously the second magnet is mounted on a protrusion on said working flyer arm. Advantageously the said first magnet is mounted on a protruding element on the said presser finger. Where, as is preferred, the presser finger comprises a presser finger rod which extends generally parallel to the working flyer arm and a presser finger radial arm extending laterally with respect to the presser finger rod, the first magnet is advantageously on the said presser finger rod. The first magnet is advantageously mounted on a surface of the presser finger, and preferably of the presser finger rod. In some circumstances it may be desirable to provide a protrusion or other element on the presser finger rod, upon which protrusion or element the first magnet is mounted. Preferably, said second magnet is mounted on an external surface of said flayer working arm. Preferably, the magnet device comprises first and second magnets mat are arranged to be in mutually repulsive relationship when the presser finger is in said first position. Instead, or as well, however, the magnet may comprise first and second magnets that are arranged to be in mutually attractive relationship when the presser finger is in said first position.<br>
7- <br><br>
Advantageously, fee presser finger comprises a presser finger rod, which is pivotaMy attached to fee flyer working arm at least two coaxial spaced pivot points. Advantageously, the presser finger rod extends in a direction generally parallel to said working flyer arm and the presser finger further comprises a presser finger radial arm which extends from said presser finger rod in a direction generally transversely relative to fee working flayer arm. Advantageously, fee presser finger radial arm comprises an arcuate position, which is connected at a proximal end to fee presser finger rod, and a presser finger paddle at a distal end of said arcuate portion for contacting a bobbin in winding thereof. Preferably, fee arcuate portion of presser finger radial arm is integral wife fee presser finger rod.<br>
Advantageously, the presser finger, and preferably a presser finger radial arm thereof, can, in use, be urged into contact wife fee bobbin by centrifugal force arising from rotation of fee flayer. In a preferred arrangement of fee invention, the first position is a position in which fee forces on fee presser finger arising from rotation of fee flayer would not normally tend to move fee presser finger into contact with the bobbin whilst the second position is a position in which fee forces on fee presser arm arising from rotation of fee flyer would tend to move fee presser arm into contact wife fee bobbin. It will be appreciated that, in feat context and elsewhere herein, references to the presser<br>
8- -<br><br>
finger"s contacting the bobbin are intended to include the case where a part of the presser finger contacts the bobbin.<br>
Thus, in a preferred arrangement of the invention, a presser finger assembly consisting of a presser finger rod, presser finger radial arm and presser finger paddle is mounted on a hollow arm of the flyer, which is rotatable around the axis of the bobbin. On initiation of the rotation of the flyer for winding, the driving shaft, hollow arm and presser finger assembly start rotating. The presser finger rod, being heavier than the radial arm, is located outside the predetermined radius P from the center of the bobbin. In said preferred embodiment, the center of gravity of the said presser finger assembly, which lies on the rod of the presser finger, is therefore located outside the predetermined radius P. Owing to this arrangement, on initiation of the rotation of the flyer due to the centrifugal force, the presser finger rod moves outward, resulting into presser finger radial arm being pressed on the bobbin to be wound.<br>
As long as the presser finger rod on which the center of gravity of presser finger assembly is located is within the predetermined radius P from the bobbin axis, the presser finger paddle and presser finger assembly is not swung inside but rather swung outside. Magnetic force on the assembly only comes<br>
9- -<br><br>
into play when the presser finger radial arm and presser finger paddle is rotated on its axis and is opened to the maximum opening, whereby the presser finger rod is located inside the predetermined radius P.<br>
The movement of presser finger radial arm from the radius, where center of gravity of the presser finger rod is outside radius P, to the maximum position of removal of ftdly wound bobbin, where the center of gravity of presser finger rod is inside the radhis P, can be done through the actuating device, for example, an actuating element or an actuating lever L. This helps in removal of the folly wound bobbin B. On release of presser finger rod from the actuating lever L, the magnetic force present pushes the presser finger assembly back into the position where the center of gravity of the presser finger rod is outside the predetermined radius P.<br>
The said magnetic force can be generated by the magnet device present on the presser finger rod and hollow arm of the flyer, facing each other during the maximum opening position.<br>
The magnet devices used for locating the presser finger assembly back to the winding position are preferably non-contact type device. These magnet devices may be simple magnets, which are fixed on the hollow arm of the flyer<br>
10-<br><br>
and presser finger rod. As the system devised is of a non-contact type, no wear and tear or jamming or replacement is expected during normal working, as there are no moving parts within the working system. In case of any damage due to external factors, replacement of magnet/s can easily and immediately be done on site.<br>
The said magnet devices can be located on the hollow arm of the flyer, below the pivot and on the presser finger rod. The magnetic force comes into play only when the magnets are brought against each other when the presser finger radial arm is opened for the removal of fully wound bobbin and the actuating lever is already exerting a force for locating the presser finger radial arm in the position of maximum opening.<br>
The said magnet devices are placed such that the like/similar poles face each other. Thus, when the presser finger assembly is released from the actuating lever, the repulsive magnetic force of the magnet devices is instrumental in pushing back the presser finger assembly into the position for initial winding, where the center of gravity of presser finger rod is outside the predetermined radius P.<br>
11 -<br><br>
The devices used to generate magnetic force as described above can be button type magnets, which due to their property of generating repulsive force, when like/similar poles are facing each other are able to achieve the goal of swinging back the presser finger assembly from the outer most position attained during the removal of full bobbin to the preferred position for initiating the winding of the bobbin. Devices used can be electrical, electronic or any other known systems used for generating magnetic force, and can be located on the hollow arm, pivots and /or on the presser finger rod.<br>
Alternatively, the said magnets can be located in a manner such that the opposite poles face each other, thereby generating attractive force.<br>
The invention also provides a roving frame comprising a plurality of flyers according to the invention. The roving frame advantageously comprises an actuating lever L for moving the presser arm to the above-mentioned first position on completion of winding of a bobbin, to facilitate removal thereof. Such actuating devices or levers are well known in me art and do not in themselves form a part of this invention.<br>
During the operation of speed frame in which the bobbin winding terminates at the maximum bobbin circumference and automatic replacement<br>
12 -<br><br>
can begin, the presser finger paddle lies against the bobbin surface without any external force. To enable the bobbin to be removed from the region of rotation of the flyer, the presser finger assembly has to be moved into the positions appropriate for the bobbin removal.<br>
The presser finger rod is engaged by actuating lever* and swung about its pivot axis against the magnetic force of the magnet device so that the presser finger paddle resting against the bobbin is swung away from the bobbin surface. When the presser finger rod is liberated by the actuating lever, the magnetic force of the magnet device returns the presser finger assembly into the position in which the presser finger paddle is located at the maximum bobbin circumference. In mis case, the presser finger assembly has its presser finger rod so located that the center of gravity is positioned, with rotation of the flyer to swing the presser finger assembly against the empty bobbin which has replaced the full bobbin upon start-up of winding. It will be appreciated mat, in the arrangement just described, the actuating lever must exert a force on the presser finger which somewhat exceeds the force generated by the magnet device. Simultaneously the flyer of the invention ensures that the bobbin can be wound during the winding process without additional detrimental pressure.<br>

Two illustrative embodiments of the present invention will now be described with respect to the figures accompanying the provisional specification and also with respect to the figures accompanying this specification wherein the same characters are used to denote the same parts. However, the figures are only illustrative and in no way limit the scope of the invention. In the said figures:<br>

14 -<br><br>
Figure 8 shows an exploded top view of a flyer arm of a second embodiment<br>
having a different arrangement of locating magnets;<br>
Figure 9 shows the front view of the flyer with bobbin and actuating lever.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 schematically show a flyer for a speed frame (roving frame), the flyer having a driving shaft 1 for mounting and rotating the flyer, hollow arm (working flyer arm) 2 aligned parallel to the length of the bobbin B being wound by the flyer and solid arm (also known as counter weight arm) 12.<br>
The presser finger assembly mounted on the said hollow arm 2, comprises presser finger rod 3, presser finger radial arm 4, presser finger paddle 5 and welded pieces 6 and 7 having an aperture for forming a pivot C for the rotation of the presser finger generally along the predetermined radius P with the help of pins 8 mounted on the pivot. The presser finger paddle 5 is located at the end of the presser finger radial arm 4 formed in continuation of the presser finger rod 3. Presser finger radial arm is also the path for the roving frame flyer exit to the bobbin being wound. Presser finger paddle 5 located on the end of the presser finger radial arm 4 facilitates the winding process by applying force on the bobbin during the winding process.<br>
15 -<br><br>
Magnet 10 is mounted on a lug 9 projected from hollow arm 2, magnet 11 is fixed on presser finger rod 3.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the presser finger rod 3 changes its position from initiation of winding to the removal of bobbin from the flyer as follows: -<br>
a.	At the start up of winding, the presser finger paddle 5 is lying at the<br>
inner most position Pt, adjacent to the bobbin B to be wound and presser<br>
finger rod 3, is outside the predeteimined radius P formed between the<br>
axis of rotation of flyer X-X (refer Figure 1) and the pivot C.<br>
b.	At the stage of completion of winding, when the bobbin has been wound<br>
to diameter D and is considered to be full, the presser finger paddle 5 is<br>
lying at the position Pz and the presser finger rod 3, is still outside the<br>
predetermined radius P. C3F3 is the centrifugal force acting on the<br>
presser finger radial arm from C3 through F3 in the range CR<br>
(Centrifugal Force Range), due to rotation of the flyer.<br>
c.	Winding of the textile filament on the bobbin can be carried out till the<br>
diameter of the bobbin does not exceed the distance between two arms<br>
16 -<br><br>
of the flyer. At the stage of removal of bobbin from the flyer, actuating lever L (on the machine on which the flyer is supported) acts upon the presser finger rod 3 and forces it to swing through force FiLi3 generated by an actuating lever from L1 to F1 to the position of maximum opening, suitable for removal of bobbin from me flyer. At this stage i.e. Position P3, the presser finger paddle 5 is located at the maximum opening stage and the presser finger rod 3 is inside the predetermined radius P.<br>
Referring to Figures 5 and 6, the figures show details of magnets mounted on the flyer hollow arm and the presser finger rod. At the end of winding process on the speed frame, when the replacement of bobbin is due and presser finger rod 3 is located at position P2 (Refer Figure 3), actuating lever L acts on the presser finger rod 3 to pull back and hold the presser finger rod 3 to a location where the presser finger paddle 5 is located at the Position P3 (Refer Figure 3) which does not obstruct the removal of full bobbin. At this position, the presser finger rod 3 lies inside the predetermined radius P.<br>
Thus, for replacement of the bobbin, the presser finger paddle 5 is brought to position P3, where magnet 11 mounted on the presser finger rod 3 gets located to a specific and predetermined position facing magnet 10 fixed on the projected lug 9 emerging from the hollow arm 2. The magnets 10 and 11<br>
17 -<br><br>
are so arranged that their like poles are opposed to one another when the presser finger is in position P3.<br>
On withdrawal of actuating lever from the presser finger rod 3 after the removal of fully wound bobbin and before the start up of new bobbin, magnets 10 and 11 facing each other forces the presser finger assembly to swing away from the position P3 to position P2, through magnetic force M2F2 acting through M2 to F2 in the magnetic influence range MR (Refer Figure 3), so as to locate the center of gravity of presser finger assembly outside the radius P.<br>
Position P2 achieved by the presser finger assembly is the desirable position for start up of winding of empty bobbin as the presser finger paddle 5 can immediately align with the empty bobbin B. In that position, the center of gravity of the presser finger rod 3 is located outside the radius P and in consequence, the presser finger paddle 5 can immediately align the empty bobbin B.<br>
Figure 7 shows an enlarged view of the magnet arrangement comprising magnet 10 rigidly fixed on the hollow arm 2 by means of an additional lug 9 provided on the hollow arm 2 and magnet 11 rigidly fixed on the presser finger<br>
18 -<br><br>
rod 3. This system provides a non-contact type of arrangement for achieving movement of presser finger assembly on its pivot C located on me flyer arm.<br>
In another embodiment shown in Figure 8 an alternate magnet arrangement comprises mounting a presser finger magnet, magnet 11 on a member 7 that is fixed to the presser finger arm, for example, by welding and mounting the other magnet 10 on the hollow arm 2 in a specified and predetermined position so that similar/like poles are facing each other when the presser finger assembly is at the maximum position ie, where the presser finger rod 3 has its center of gravity within the predetermined radius P.<br>
Figure 9 shows the bobbin B mounted on the roving frame along with the flyer and actuating lever L used for opening the presser finger arm to maximum opening position P3 (refer figure 3).<br>
Whilst the invention has been described in the above embodiments with reference to permanent magnets, it will be appreciated that the invention extends to other kinds of magnets, for example, electromagnets, as already mentioned.<br>
19 -<br><br>
Further, whilst the embodiments include magnets which are opposed, it is also possible for the magnets to be provided in suitable alternative locations with non-like poles facing one another, the alternative locations being so selected that attraction of the magnets effects the same movement of the presser finger arm as that effected by die repulsion of the magnets in the embodiments described.<br>
GENERAL WORKING OF THE INVENTION;<br>
On initiation of the rotation of me flyer for winding, the driving shaft 1, hollow arm 2 and presser finger assembly start rotating. At the start up of winding, the presser finger paddle 5 is lying at the inner most position Pi, adjacent to the bobbin B to be wound and presser ringer rod 3, is outside the predetermined radius P formed between the axis of rotation of flyer X-X and the pivot C. The winding of the textile filament on the bobbin B is carried out till the diameter of the bobbin B does not exceed the distance between two arms of the flyer. At the stage of completion of winding, when the bobbin B has been wound to diameter D and is considered to be full, the presser finger paddle 5 is lying at the position P2 and the presser finger rod 3, is still outside the predetermined radius P. At this stage, the actuating lever L acts on the presser finger rod 3 to pull back and hold the presser finger rod 3 to a location<br>
20-<br><br>
where the presser finger paddle 5 is located at the Position P3. When the presser finger paddle 5 is located at the Position P3, where the presser finger rod 3 has its center of gravity within the predetermined radius P, the magnets 10 and 11 are such that their like poles are opposed to one another. On withdrawal of the actuating lever L from the presser finger rod 3, after the removal of fully wound bobbin and before the start up of new bobbin, magnets 10 and 11 facing each other forces the presser finger rod 3 to swing away from the position P3 to position P2, so as to locate the center of gravity of presser finger assembly outside the radius P.<br>
