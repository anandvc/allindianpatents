Heat-stable encapsulated pigments<br>
i The present invention relates to novel pigment compositions, to processes for the<br>
preparation thereof and to the use thereof for producing coloured engineering plastics (thermoplastics that maintain dimensional stability and most mechanical properties above 100°C or below 0°C), especially those based on polyamide.<br>
Mass-colouring of polymer processed at high temperatures, such as engineering<br>
plastics and in particular polyamides is usually carried out using so-called solvent<br>
dyes, which are soluble in the polyamide mass at high processing temperatures<br>
and which, besides having the requisite high heat resistance, also have adequate<br>
chemical stability with respect to, for example, the highly reductive medium of the<br>
polyamide melt. However, soluble dyes generally have much poorer	ji<br>
lightfastness, as compared with pigments.<br>
■|i<br>
ji<br>
The use of pigments in such polymers is restricted almost exclusively to inorganic<br>
i| pigments, most of which contain heavy metals, and to a very small selection of<br>
specific organic pigments, mainly from the phthalocyanine or quinacridone class.<br>
Inorganic pigments, however, have generally low chroma and low colour     |<br>
strength. Organic pigments have disadvantages such as crystal phase and colour<br>
changes, migration, a frequent tendency of the coloured materials to fluoresce,<br>
and often a reactive interaction with the polymer, leading to degradation of the<br>
pigment and/or deterioration of the polymer's mechanical properties.	(j<br>
ii ,i<br>
There is therefore a need for new colourants which in mass-coloured engineering<br>
j! plastics processed at high temperature result in highly saturated, strongly   ;i<br>
coloured, non-fluorescent colourations that are light-fast and have high-     J<br>
il temperature stability, and which exhibit good allround fastness properties, without<br>
affecting negatively the physical properties of the polymeric material.	j<br>
i. FR1 551 400 and EP 0046 729 disclose azopyrimidine colourants. EP 0 061'426 discloses diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments. WO 98/18 866 discloses pteridine| pigments.<br><br>
US 3,826,670 discloses encapsulated pigments with an intermediate ionically crossiinked polymeric salt and a skin consisting essentially of dense, amorphous, hydrated oxide or hydroxide of silicon, titanium or zirconium.<br>
EP 0 744448 discloses pigments suitable for stencil inks, which are encapsulated in a polymeric matrix obtained from the reaction of polyisocyanates with polyols.<br>
WO 2006/089 933 discloses aqueous dispersions comprising pigments that are at least partially sheathed in radiation-curable polyurethane, their production and use especially for inkjet printing.<br>
US 5,905,111 discloses a continuous process for preparing acrylate based pigment preparations. However, such pigment preparations do not provide satisfactory results in engineering plastics.<br>
US 6,800,127 discloses pigment preparations comprising polyamide particles with an average size of below 50j.im and an average pigment size below 0.2 \xm. However, especially the fastness properties are still not fully satisfactory.<br>
WO 06/111 493 is a patent application according to Art. 54(3) EPC and Rule 64.3 PCT, which is directed to pigments encapsulated by polymers which are not crossiinked.<br>
It has now been found that the pigment compositions according to the invention surprisingly meet the above-mentioned criteria to a larger extent.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a pigment composition comprising solid particles, which particles comprise from 20 to 75% by weight of an organic pigment and from 80 to 25% by weight of a crossiinked polymer, preferably from 25 to 60% by weight of an organic pigment and from 75 to 40% by weight of a crossiinked polymer, each based on the total weight of the solid particles, wherein the surface of the solid particles consists essentially of the crossiinked polymer and the crossiinked polymer is obtainable from a crosslinking agent and a prepolymer of average molecular weight Mw from 2000 to 200000, preferably<br>
3<br><br><br>
epoxy or primary or secondary amino groups or (b2) unsaturated bonds, wherein Ri is H, CrC4alkyl, C2-C4a!kenyl or COOR5, R2 and R3 are independently from one another H, OR6, NHR6, Ci-C4alkyl or C2-C4alkenyl, R4, R5 and R6 are independently from one another H, unsubstttuted CrC6alkyl or C2-C6aikenyi, or C2-C6alkyl or C2-C6alkenyl each substituted by one or more hydroxy and/or epoxy groups, and n is a number from 2 to 2000, preferably from 5 to 1500.<br>
The organic pigment is either directly embedded in the crosslinked polymer, or it is chemically or physically surface-modified or encapsulated, for example with a pigment derivative, a polymer or a layer of one or more transition metal oxides adsorbed on or bound to its surface. However, the pigment and any optional additional components should be fully surrounded by crosslinked polymer, as the surface of the solid particles should consist essentially of the crosslinked polymer, in order the desired properties to be obtained.<br>
The prepolymers are most suitably homo- or copolymers based on unsaturated monomers selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid and their derivatives, such as esters and amides thereof and maleic acid anhydride, which monomers may be copolymerized with less polar monomers such as vinyl chloride, vinyl alcohol or preferably styrene. Preferably, the prepolymers comprise at least 30% by weight of repeating blocks of formula (I).<br>
These prepolymers are crosslinked with any known crosslinking agent, for example reactive crosslinking agents such as polyisocyanates, polyhydrazides, polycarboxylic acids, polyoxazolines, polyaziridines, polyepoxides, polysulfonazides, poiyketimines, melamine-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, or with crosslinking agents forming salts for example with carboxy groups of the prepolymer, such as polyamines or metal ions. Polyfunc-<br>
4<br><br>
tional crosslinking agents comprise generally from 2 to 10, preferably 2, 3 or 4, especially 2 functional groups.<br>
A particularly preferred aspect of the invention, however, is the use of self crosslinking prepolymers, which comprise both crosslinkable and crosslinking groups such as described above. The crosslinkable and crosslinking groups may be on the same backbone, optionally as blocks of a copolymer, or also on different backbones imbricated together.<br>
Suitable prepolymers are known and a large choice thereof is available commer¬cially, too. Suitable prepolymers are for example disclosed in WO 01 /74 735. Commercially available self crosslinking prepolymers are for example Acronal® LR 8977, Acronal® S 760 na (both BASF AG, Ludwigshafen/DE) and Glascol® C 44 (CIBA Specialty Chemicals Inc.).<br>
The amount of crosslinking agent is generally from 1 to 25% by weight, based on the amount of prepolymer. When the crosslinking agent is separately added to the prepolymer, its amount is preferably from 2 to 20% by weight, most preferably from 3 to 10% by weight, based on the amount of prepolymer. When the crosslinking agent is physically comprised in a self crosslinking prepolymer, its amount is preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, most preferably from 4 to 10% by weight, based on the amount of prepolymer. When the crosslinking agent is part of a self crosslinking prepolymer backbone, the amount of monomers comprising self crosslinking groups used to make the prepolymer is preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, most preferably from 4 to 10% by weight, based on the total amount of monomers used to make the prepolymer.<br>
Crosslinking reactions are known in the art of coatings (see for example Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Paints and Coatings, 2. Types of Paints and Coatings (Binders), Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, 6th Edition 2002). The crosslinking reaction can take place simply at room temperature, such as in the case of aqueous acrylic prepolymer dispersions to which bishydrazides or aziridines are subsequently added, or at elevated temperature, such as from<br><br>

50 to 300°C, especially from 130 to 200°C, optionally in the presence of a   jj suitable catalyst, for example acids, metal compounds, amines, ammonium'or hydroxy ions, such as hydrochloric acid, dibutyl tin laurate, triethylamine or j-<br>
tetrabutylammonium iodide.	|<br>

The instant pigment compositions generally comprise pigment particles having a<br>
size of from 0.01 to 10 ^m, preferably up to 5 jam, most preferred from 0.05 to<br>
2 ]im, especially from 0.1 to 1 |.im. The capsules comprising the pigment     ll<br>
preferably have an average volume from 10"20 to 10~8 m3, especially from 10~18 to<br>
10"10m3.	|<br>
i The instant pigment compositions comprise adequately from 0 to 20% by weight<br>
of other components, preferably from 0 to 3% by weight of volatile components,<br>
most preferred up to 2% by weight of volatile components, based on the total<br>
pigment composition. The volatile components preferably consist of organic-!<br>
solvents or water, most preferred water.<br>
Any organic pigment can be used, for example diketopyrrolopyrrole, quinacrido-ne, azo, quinophthalone, phthalocyanine, indanthrone, flavanthrone, pyranthrone, anthraquinone, perylene, dioxazine, perinone, thioindigo, isoindolinone, isoindoline, pteridine and metal complex pigments.<br>

C2-Ci2Alkenyl or C3-Ci2cycloalkenyl is respectively C2-C12alkyl or C3-Ci2cycloalkyl that is mono- or poly-unsaturated, wherein two or more double bonds may be isolated or conjugated, for example vinyl, allyl, 2-propen-2-yl, 2-buten-1 -yl, 3-buten-1-yl, 1,3-butadien-2-yl, 2-cyclobuten-1-yl, 2-penten-1-yl, 3-penten-2-yl, 2-methyl-1-buten-3-yl, 2-methy!-3-buten-2-yl, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl, 1,4-pentadien-3-yl, 2-cyclopenten-1-yl, 2-cyclohexen-1-yl, 3-cyclohexen-1-yl, 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl, 1-p-menthen-8-yl, 4{10)-thujen-10-yl, 2-norbornen-1-yl, 2,5-norbornadien-1 -yl, 7,7-dimethyl-2,4-norcaradien-3-yl or the various isomers of hexenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, deceny! ordodecenyl.<br>
The pigments preferably have a specific surface area of from 10 to 150 rn2/g. Special preference is given to opaque pigments having a specific surface area of from 12 to 50 m2/g and to transparent pigments having a specific surface area of from 50 to 100 m2/g.<br>
The instant pigment compositions are suitably prepared by dispersing the pigment and the prepolymer in an inert liquid medium, such as an organic solvent or preferably water, then crosslinking the prepolymer by addition of a crosslinking agent, addition of a crosslinking catalyst and/or heating. The instant pigment compositions are then preferably isolated by filtration and dried.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to isolate and optionally dry the dispersion of pigment in the prepolymer, optionally also comprising a thermally crosslinking agent, and then only to perform crosslinking by heating.<br>
Crosslinking, or optionally the final part of crosslinking, can also be effected upon final processing of the engineering plastic to be coloured.<br>
The pigment and the prepolymer can be dispersed together, or the pigment can be dispersed in a dispersion or solution of the prepolymer, or the prepolymer can be dispersed or dissolved in a dispersion of the pigment, or the prepolymer can be prepared by emulsion or suspension polymerisation in presence of the<br>
14<br><br>
pigment, for example by adding the pigment to the polymerisable monomer or mixture of monomers before the subsequent polymerisation reaction.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of producing a coloured engineering plastic, wherein an engineering plastic and a tinctorially effective amount of at least one pigment composition according to the invention are processed together at a temperature of 200°C or above, preferably from 220 to 350°C, most preferred from 240 to 330°C.<br>
Generally, the amount of instant pigment composition will be from 0.001 to 70% by weight, based on the total weight of the engineering plastic and instant pigment composition. Preferred are in the case of coloured items from 0.01 to 10% by weight, and in the case of masterbatches from 30 to 60% by weight, each based on the total weight of the engineering plastic and instant pigment composition. The engineering plastics to be colored with the instant pigment compositions are generally polymers having a molecular weight in the range of from 104to108g/mol.<br>
Colouring the engineering plastics with the pigment composition according to the invention is carried out, for example, by mixing such a pigment composition into the substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatuses, as a result of which the pigment composition is finely distributed in the engineering plastic. The high engineering plastic comprising the admixed pigment composition is then processed by methods known perse, such as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion, spread-coating, melt-spinning, casting or by injection moulding, whereby the coloured material acquires its final shape. Admixture of the pigment composition can also be effected immediately prior to the actual processing step, for example by continuously feeding a solid, for example pulverulent, pigment composition and, at the same time, a granulated or powdered engineering plastic, and optionally also additional ingredients such as, for example, additives, directly into the intake zone of the processing equipment, where mixing takes place immediately before processing. Crosslinking may also be effected or completed at this stage. Generally, however, it is preferable to mix<br>
15<br><br>
me pigment composition into the engineering plastic beforehand, since more uni¬formly coloured products can be achieved.<br>
Remarkably, the instant pigment compositions largely retain their structure upon processing, so that the instant crosslinked polymer remains around the pigments, thus preventing a direct contact between the pigment and the engineering plastic. The instant pigment compositions also have an excellent compatibility with engineering plastics.<br>
In order to produce non-rigid mouldings or to reduce their brtttleness, it is possible to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the engineering plastics prior to shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. In the method according to the invention, the plasticisers may be incorporated into the polymers before or after incorporation of the colorant. It is also possible, in order to achieve different colour shades, to add to the engineering plastics, in addition to the pigment composition according to the invention, further pigments or other colorants in any desired amounts, optionally together with further additional ingredients such as, for example, fillers or siccatives (drying agents).<br>
On the other hand, it is sometimes desirable to increase the rigidity and/or solidity, for example by incorporating glass fibers or other known reinforcing agents.<br>
Preferred engineering plastics suitable for colouring in accordance with the invention are very generally polymers having a dielectric constant &gt;2.5 at 20°C, preferably polyester (e.g. PET), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) or acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS).<br>
Special preference is given to polyester and very special preference is given to polyamide, for example polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, polyamide 12 and aramid.<br>
The pigment compositions according to the invention are well dispersible in the<br>
