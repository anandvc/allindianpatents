				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a reactive armour for providing protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Armoured fighting vehicles require protection against the higher penetrating capacity of modern shaped ammunitions. Of all the applique armours used for this purpose namely passive, ceramic, composite and explosive reactive aromour, the most efficient one for defeating shaped charge jet is the explosive reactive armour. However, the explosive reactive armour can also be counteracted by a recently developed warhead christened as "Tendem Warhead" which consists of two warheads. One warhead is small in calibre, nearest to nose and is known as pre-cursor while the other warhead is a high calibre warhead known as main charge. The pre-cursor warhead is designed to detonate the explosive content of the reactive element. After a short delay, the reactive element metal plate moves away and clears off the jet path. The main charge is then fired to attack the now unprotected base armour.<br>
Reference is made to application no. 1179/Del/2000 in the name of The Additional Director (IPR).<br>
No reactive armour or any defeating mechanism is known in the art to provide protection against tendem shaped charge warhead.<br>
NEED FOR PRESENT INVENTION<br>
There is therefore a need for a reactive armour which can provide protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead and which has also good protective capability against all high calibre shaped charge warheads.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour capable of providing protection to armoured lighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead besides providing protection against other high calibre shaped charge warheads.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour which incorporates a metal attenuator interposed between two reactive elements thereby providing higher protection against tendem shaped charge warheads.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour incorporating two reactive elements which are immune to vibrations and accidental drops upto 10 metres.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour incorporating reactive elements which are immune to small arms.<br>
Further objects of the present invention is to provide a reactive armour incorporating reactive elements which are not affected by water soaking.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a reactive armour for providing protection to armoured fighting vehicles against tendem shaped charge warhead comprising a hardened steel box (1) having a metallic lid (12) characterised by:<br>
a)	a reactive element (2,3,4) consisting of a thin rolled sheet (3) of<br>
insensitive   explosive   as   herein   described   sandwiched   between<br>
metal sheets (2) and<br>
b)	a  reactive  element  (8,9,10)   consisting  of a  rolled   sheet  (9)   of<br>
insensitive  explosive  as  herein   described   sandwiched  between<br>
metal sheets (8&amp; 9) and<br>
c)	a  metal  attenuator  (6)   interposed  between  above  two  reactive<br>
elements, with air gap (5) between the upper reactive element and<br>
the metal attenuator (6).<br>
d)	metal spacers (7,7) on which thick metal attenuator (6) is placed<br>
provided air gap (11) between the metal attenuator (6) and the<br>
lower reactive element.<br>
In accordance, with -this invention, there is provided a reactive armour, which provides protection to Armoured Fighting Vehicles against tendein shaped charge warhead besides providing protection against other high calibre shaped charge warheads, in the present invention, two reactive elements comprising of a very thin rolled explosive sheet sandwiched between two metal sheets are used. The sandwiches, i.e.the two reactive elements, are well separated from each other by a thick metallic barrier so that detonation of one sandwich does not lead to detonation of other. Th heavy metallic barrier is placed between the sandwiches which makes the precursor jet to lose its energy adequately so that it does not detonate the lower sandwich on its impact. It also attenuates the impact pressure on the lower sandwich. There is an air gap provided between the barrier and the lower sandwich to serve as free space for defonnation of the barrier. This arrangement is enclosed in metallic box for easy mounting. The reactive element box is generally mounted on base armour to have a favourable angle with respect to jet. When the jet from the precursor change interacts the first sandwich, the explosive in it is initiated due to impact forces of the jet. The explosion makes the metal plates to fly apart at an angle to the jet, thereby offering fresh metal surface everytime to incoming jet. This way the jet is considerably consumed and residual jet is not able to ininitate the lower sandwich. The second sandwich is initiated by the main charge and perturbs the jet in the<br>
similar way. Thus the tendem warhead is rendered inefficient on penetrating through tank armour,<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with the help of a figure which shows an embodiment of the present invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation. It is to be understood that the principles and features of the present invention can be employed in different embodiments through adaptations, modifications and changes in the structure of the armour, by those skilled in the art and such embodiments are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying drawings:-<br>
Fig 1: shows the construction of the reactive armour<br>
of the present invention based on metal attenuator interposed between two reactive elements.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to Fig 1, a hardened steel box (1) houses two reactive elements(2,3,4) and (8,9,10) and is closed with metallic lid (12). The first reactive element (2,3,4) comprises of a thin rolled sheet (3) of a very insensitive explosive sandwiched between a thin metal sheets (2) and thin metal sheet (4). The second reactive element (8,9,10), comprises of a thin explosive sheet (9) of very insensitive explosive sandwiched between thin<br>
metal sheet (8) and thin metal sheet (10). In between the two reactive elements, there is a heavy metallic barrier (6) placed on metal spacers(7,7). The metal barrier (6) makes the precursor jet of tendem shaped charge warhead, to lose its energy adequate to prevent detonation of lower reactive elements and attenuates the impact pressure on the lower reactive element. The air gap (11) between the metal barrier (6) and lower reactive element and air gap (5) provides free space for deformation of the barrier.<br>
The very insensitive explosive is prepared by mixing RDX and HTPB (as binder) taking RDX preferably in proportion of 75 to 85 parts and HTPB in proportion of 15 to 25 parts. The mixture in the form of dough, is allowed to pass through a roller to get a uniform homogenous explosive in the form of a sheet of desired thickness. The sheet is allowed to pass through the roller 3-4 times to achieve surface smootluess. The sheet of very insensitive explosive is cut to the size of thin metal sheets (2,4) and (8,10) and is sandwiched between these metal plates to make reactive elements as described above.<br>
The invention of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes, adaptations by those skilled in art. Such modifications, changes, adaptations are intended to be within the scope of present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
