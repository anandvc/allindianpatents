				<td>HELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of n-alkanes of the formula n-CH3(CH2)xCH3 where n=6-17.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
The hydrocarbons are the most broadly used organic compounds known, and are quite literally the driving force of western civilization. The greatest amounts of hydrocarbons are used as fuel for combustion, particularly in heating and motor fuel applications.<br>
With pentane, the saturated hydrocarbons enter the realm of room-temperature liquids. This makes them useful as organic solvents, cleaners, and transport fuels. Gasoline for internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, tractors, lawnmowers, and so on, is rated in combustion properties relative to octane. It is in fact a combination of liquid hydrocarbons ranging from hexanes to decanes. Slightly larger hydrocarbons are known as kerosene or jet fuel, diesel fuel and heating oil. Still larger hydrocarbon molecules serve as lubricating oils, and greases. Eventually a point is reached at which the materials are solids at room temperature. These are the waxes. Hydrocarbon molecules larger than those of the waxes are the heavy greases and the tars commonly used in roofing applications and highway construction.<br>
In the last two decades, hydrocarbons are found to have new important applications such as insect pheromones and special lubricants in high-tech areas. This new utility as insect pheromones has lead to requirement of synthesis of pure hydrocarbons.<br>
One of the processes known in the art for the preparation of aliphatic straight chain saturated hydrocarbons involves generation from the thermal 'cracking' and fractional distillation of crude oil (Ref: Morrison, R.T. &amp; Boyd, R. N. Organic chemistry, Prentice Hall publications, Sixth edition, 1992, page 94). the main disadvantage of this technology is that the above process is very tedious as it involves separation of pure hydrocarbons by fractional distillation from the mixture of close boiling hydrocarbons.<br>
Still another disadvantage of this technology is that the composition of raw material varies with source of petroleum well.<br>
Another disadvantage of this technology is that the process is not cost effective for preparation of pure<br>
9<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
Another known process in the art for preparation of aliphatic straight chain saturated hydrocarbons<br><br>
involves hydrolysis of alkyl magnesium halide.<br>
The major drawback of this method is that the process involves the use of dried diethyl ether, which has very low flash point and highly inflammable for the preparation of alkyl magnesium halide. Since the reaction is moisture sensitive, great caution should be employed in storage, handling and transfer operations.<br>
Another drawback of this method is that the overall yield of the final product is low.<br>
Still another drawback of this process is that the use of magnesium leads to large quantities of toxic effluent; thus the process is not environment friendly.<br>
Another process for the preparation of aliphatic saturated hydrocarbons involves catalytic synthesis from carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Reference is taken from European Patent publication No. UA78656, dated 10.04.2007. Aliphatic hydrocarbons containing more than one carbon atom, particularly liquid hydrocarbons, are produced by reacting mixtures of carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide with atleast an equal volume of hydrogen in the presence of catalysts, at ordinary or slightly increased or reduced pressure, and at temperatures of 180-200° C.<br>
The main disadvantage of this process is that mixture of hydrocarbons is produced and required pure hydrocarbon from the mixture of products.<br>
Another disadvantage of this process is the use of two gases viz carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide and hydrogen at high pressure and temperature. Maintenance of same condition is required for the formation of the required hydrocarbon product.<br>
Yet, another disadvantage of this method is the use of highly inflammable gas, hydrogen as the raw material which makes the process hazardous.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of this process is the use of particular catalyst composition. The formation of the required" hydrocarbon decreases when the catalyst activity" decreases and varies with the composition of the catalyst.<br>
Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires special equipment, thus this process is not cost-effective also.<br>
Another disadvantage of this process is that it is not suitable for hydrocarbons having more than 10 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Another method reported in the literature is the preparation of alkanes by Wurtz reaction i.e. reaction of sodium with alkyl halides to give even numbered carbon containing symmetrical alkanes.<br>
The main drawback of this method is that it is suitable only for the preparation of even numbered carbon containing symmetrical alkanes.<br>
Another drawback of this method is the use of sodium metal which is highly reactive (moisture sensitive, flammable). Dangerous explosion may result if sodium come comes in contact with water.<br>
Another drawback of this reaction is that it is not suitable for upscaling as handling of sodium in more quantity requires further more safety procedures.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
There is a need to develop a simple and cost effective method for the preparation and process development of n-alkanes which can be upscaled to manufacturing process and overcome the disadvantages/drawbacks of the processes known in the art.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and simple method for the preparation of n-alkanes using indigenously available raw materials to make the process cost effective.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide and environment friendly process without using any hazardous chemicals.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple process for the preparation of n-alkanes which give pure product for its use as pheromones.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention, is to provide a new process for the preparation of n-alkanes which do not require the use of any flammable moisture sensitive reagents.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a new process for the preparation of n-alkanes which gives excellent yield.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel process for the synthesis of n-alkanes which can easily be upscaled.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a new process for the preparation of n-alkanes in which effluent load is minimum.<br><br>
