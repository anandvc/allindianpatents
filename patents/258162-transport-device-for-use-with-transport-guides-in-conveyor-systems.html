SPECIFICATION<br>
TRANSPORT DEVICE FOR USE WITH TRANSPORT GUIDES<br>
IN CONVEYOR SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conveyor systems for transporting articles from one place to another are well known. Certain conveyor systems include conveyor tables which function as tracks for moving boxes and other articles from one location to another. To facilitate movement in multiple directions, some of these tables include a grid of ball transfers which utilize a series of ball bearings which make contact with the articles. These known ball transfers include a main contact ball and multiple relatively small inner balls. Each ball transfer is mounted to the table.<br>
One disadvantage associated with these ball transfers is that dirt, dust and other debris may fall between the ball transfers. As the debris accumulates over time, the debris that has fallen between the ball transfer housings can interfere with the movement of the articles rolling on the ball transfers. This debris problem can hinder performance and shorten the life of the ball transfers. Another disadvantage of these ball transfers is that each ball transfer must be mounted to the table. This can result in relatively significant installation and replacement labor costs.<br>
Certain conveyor systems include a plate which lies on top of the ball transfers. The plate has a plurality of holes, each of which receives the main contact ball, enabling the contact balls to come into contact with the moving article. One of the known purposes of these plates is to help stabilize articles which may be non-rigid, may have a non-imiform shape or whose comers or edges may, from time to time, be positioned at an angle relative to the table. These plates are also known to decrease the amount of debris which tends to accumulate between the ball transfers.<br>
Because these plates are mounted on the ball transfers, the ball transfers have a relatively significant role in the stability or instability of the plates. The known ball transfers described above cause these plates to have a relatively high degree of instability. This is due, in part, to the shape of these ball transfers. The portion of the ball transfer which supports the weight of the plate is fully or partially convex.<br><br>
Therefore, the plate, which is substantially flat, has a relatively high degree of freedom with respect to the ball transfers. This freedom of movement causes the plates to be relatively unstable. Depending upon the conveyor operating conditions, the plates can wobble and become dislodged from time to time. When this occurs, articles can become damaged or misguided, and debris may accxunulate in between the ball transfers. Furthermore, this instability can result in reduced efficiency of conveyor systems, increased production down time and increased need for maintenance. Therefore, there is a need to overcome these disadvantages,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a transport device for use with transport guides in conveyor systems, and the present invention also relates to a conveyor assembly including an array of transport guides which support one or more transport guides. The transport device and conveyor assembly of the present invention aid in the transport of articles from one place to another while providing enhanced stability to transport guides, such as flat plates.<br>
In one embodiment, the transport device of the present invention includes a rotatable contact member, such as a major ball bearing, supported by a holder. The major ball bearing is further supported in the holder by a plurality of minor bail bearings. The minor ball bearings engage the major ball bearing enabling articles to be conveyed with a relatively small degree of friction.<br>
The holder of the transport device includes a transport guide stabilizer. In one embodiment, the transport guide stabilizer is a relatively flat load bearing surface which supports the load of the transport guide. This transport guide stabilizer provides increased stability to the transport guide during conveyor operations.<br>
In one embodiment, the conveyor assembly of the present invention includes a plurality of the transport devices, described above, assembled in a pattern on a transport siuface. The conveyor assembly further includes a transport guide, such as a plate, which in one embodiment, defines holes adapted to fit over the major ball bearing of the transport devices and a portion of the holder. The transport guide stabilizers of the transport devices provide a surface for supporting the load of the transport guide while increasing the stability of the transport guide.<br><br>
By increasing the stability of the transport guide, the transport device of the present invention assists the transport guide in its role of: (a) reducing the accumulation of dirt, dust, and other debris in between the transport devices; (b) increasing the life of the transport devices; and (c) aiding in stabilizing articles which may be non-rigid, may have non-uniform shape or whose comers or edges may be positioned at an angle relative to the transport surface or table.<br>
It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to provide a transport device for use with transport guides in conveyor systems.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a transport device that increases the stability of transport guides m conveyor systems.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is to decrease the need for maintenance in conveyor systems.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to decrease damage to articles in conveyance operations.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is to decrease the amount of time and labor required to replace or re-configure transport devices in conveyor systems.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to increase the life of transport devices.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to decrease down time in conveyor operations.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings. Figs. lA to 5 illustrate the transport device 10, transport device 11 and conveyor assembly 13 in various embodiments of the present invention. The transport device 10, illustrated in Figs, lA to 2, includes: (a) a holder 12, including a transport guide stabilizer 14; and (b) a rotatable contact member 16 rotatably supported by the holder 12. The holder 12 further includes: (a) a transport surface engagement member 18 for securing the holder 12 to a transport surface 24; (b) a body 20; (c) at least one and preferably a plurality of fnction reducing members 22; and (d) a guide member, track or race 42 which holds the fnction reducing members 22 in a circular formation while enabling the fnction reducing members 22 to roll relative to the race 42. The transport surface engagement member 18 allows the holder 12 to be secured to a transport surface 24 such as a table or other support structure for a conveyor system. The transport surface engagement member 18 preferably includes left and right flange moimt members 18a and 18b at the base or lower portion 20a of the body 20. The flange mount members 18a and 18b each include a fastener 28 which secures the holder 12 to the transport surface 24.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, shown in Fig. 3, the transport device 11 includes an elongated surface engagement member 30. The elongated transport surface engagement member 30 is preferably a bolt, stud, rod, pin or other suitable fastener. It should be appreciated, however, that the transport device of the present invention can be attached to a conveyor structure 24 utilizing any suitable fastener or fastening technique, such as hook and loop type fasteners, adhesives and welding.   It should also be appreciated that some of the transport<br><br>
devices of the present invention need not include a transport surface engagement member. These transport devices can be held in place by the transport guide 36 as described below.<br>
In transport devices 10 and 11, the body 20 of the holder 12 includes: (a) a loM^er portion 20a which preferably houses the friction reducing members 22 and the race 42; and (b) an upper portion 20b, rotatably supporting the rotatable contact member 16. The upper portion 20b is preferably crimp fastened to the lower portion 20a. It should be appreciated, however, that the body 20 can include a single integral piece or more than two portions.<br>
It is preferable that each friction reducing member 22 is a relatively small ball bearing. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention can include any suitable friction reducing member, including, but not limited to, a lubricant, a socket or any other suitable friction reducing material or device.<br>
The transport guide stabilizer 14 includes a load bearing surface 32 and a roimded shoulder portion 34. The load bearing surface 32 is preferably flat or substantially flat and horizontally positioned surface adapted to support the load of a portion of a transport guide 36 (described below). The substantially flat or uniform configuration of the load bearing surface 32 aids in the stable support of the transport guide 36. The load bearing surface 32 limits or reduces the degrees of freedom of the transport guide 36, thereby stabilizing the transport guide 36. Specifically, it is preferable that the portion 36a of the transport guide 36 which engages the load bearing surface 32 lies in a plane which is parallel or substantially parallel to the plane in which the load bearing surface 32 lies. Therefore, a flat surface area of the load bearing surface 32 receives a substantially uniform load pressure from a flat surface area of the portion 36a. Consequently, the transport guide 36 is preferably less likely to wobble or move relative to the transport devices of the present invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that in other embodiments not illustrated, the transport guide stabilizer of the present invention can include any suitable transport guide engagement member which engages the transport guide 36 in a removable fashion. Such transport guide engagement member need not be flat or substantially flat. For example, such transport guide engagement member can include a suitable mating member which mechanically mates with the transport guide 36, such as one or more notches, protrusions or other irregularities which mate with one or more notches.<br><br>
protrusions or irregularities of the transport guide 36. In another example, such transport guide engagement member can include a suitable fastener which removably attaches the transport guide 36 to the transport guide stabilizer 14, such as an adhesive or hook and loop type fastener. In any case, the transport guide stabilizer 14 of the present invention is configured to aid in the stability of or otherwise increase the stability of the transport guide 36.<br>
The rotatable contact member 16 of the transport device 10 can include any device or member capable of rotational movement, such as a ball, wheel or roller. In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 is a relatively large ball bearing which is rotatably supported by the friction reducing members 22 and held in place by the top portion 20b of the body 20. As illustrated in Fig. 4, an article 46 to be transported is supported by the top surface 48 of the rotatable contact member 16. As the article 46 moves across the transport device 10, the rotatable contact member 16 rotates against the friction reducing members 22,<br>
In one embodiment illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, the present invention includes a conveyor assembly 13 including: (a) a plurality of transport devices 10,10a and 10b preferably arranged in a grid or matrix configuration; and (b) a transport guide 36 supported by the transport guide stabilizers 14 (specifically, the load bearing surface 32) of the transport devices 10,10a and 10b.<br>
In the conveyor assembly 13, the transport surface engagement members of certain transport devices 10a and 10b (shown in Fig. 5) do not need to have a fastener 28 or any other fastener which secures these transport devices 10a and 10b to the conveyor surface 24, Here, the transport device receiving walls 52 of the transport guide 36 restrain or limit the movement of the transport devices 10a and 10b relative to the conveyor surface 24. Accordingly, the transport guide 36 maintains the transport devices 10a and 10b in a predetermined position during conveyor operations. Consequently, a user can replace transport devices 10a and 10b by lifting the transport guide 36, picking up the transport devices 10a and 10b and placing new transport devices in the place of transport devices 10a and 10b.<br>
The transport guide 36 is preferably a substantially flat plate 51 having a plurality of transport device receiving walls 52 which define a plurality of apertures (not shown) to receive the rotatable contact member 16 and top portion 20b of the transport device 10.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 4, an article 46 to be transported by the conveyor assembly 13 is placed upon the top portion 48 of the rotatable contact members 16 of the plurality of transport devices 10. The transport devices 10 facilitate the movement of the article 46 by providing a surface of reduced friction upon which the article 46 is transferred. As the rotatable contact members 16 rotatably engage the friction reducing members 22 of the transport devices 10, the force necessary to start and sustain the movement of an article 46 placed on the transport devices 10 is reduced.<br>
When seated on the transport guide stabilizers 14, the transport guide 36 preferably reduces the accumulation of dirt, dust or other debris in the spaces 60 between the transport devices 10. When articles 46, which may be non-rigid, may have non-uniform shapes or may be positioned at an angle relative to the conveyor structure 24, are conveyed, the transport guide 36 frmctions as an aid to stabilize the articles 46.<br>
Method of Use<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention includes a method of transporting an article including the steps of: (a) providing a plurality of transport devices 10 assembled in a pattern and mounted on a surface 24; (b) providing a transport guide stabilizer 14 on each of the transport devices 10; (c) placing a transport guide 36 on top of the transport devices 10; and (d) enabling a force to be applied to an article 46 in order to move the article 46 along the conveyor assembly 13. The transport guide 36 guides the movement of the article 46. The transport guide 36 further reduces the collection of dust and debris in the spaces 60 between the transport devices 10 which may enter the holder 12.<br>
Materials<br>
The transport devices 10 and 11, and the conveyor assembly 13 of the present invention may be manufactiu-ed from any suitable material. The rotatable contact member 16, the friction reducing members 22 and the holder 12 may be manufactured from any suitable material such as steel or other metals, polymers, plastics and/or rubber. In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 and the friction reducing members 22 are made of steel, the holder 12 is made of sheet metal and the transport<br><br>
guide 36 is made of aluminum, steel, plexiglass, stainless steel, plastic or other materials.<br>
In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 is approximately one inch in diameter, and the holder 12 is approximately one inch in height and approximately two inches in width, excluding the width of the transport surface engagement member 18. The transport guide stabilizer is preferably located ^proximately one-half inch above the transport surface engagement member 18.<br>
The transport device of the present invention, in one embodiment includes a rotatable contact member supported by a holder, wherein the holder includes a transport guide stabilizer which stabilizes a substantially flat transport guide. In one embodiment, the transport guide stabilizer includes a substantially flat surface which supports the load of the transport guide. In another embodiment, the conveyor assembly of the present invention includes a plurality of transport devices assembled in a grid, and a transport guide supported by the transport guide stabilizers of the transport devices. The transport guide reduces the accumulation of dirt, dust and/or debris which may enter the holder portion of the transport devices, while simultaneously serving as an aid to stabilize transported articles which, due to their flexibility, shape or direction of motion may tend to travel along a conveyor system in an undesirable fashion. The present invention therefore enhances the stability of the transport guides in conveyor systems and increases the life of transport devices.<br>
It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The load bearing surface 32 limits or reduces the degrees of freedom of the transport guide 36, thereby stabilizing the transport guide 36. Specifically, it is preferable that the portion 36a of the transport guide 36 which engages the load bearing surface 32 lies in a plane which is parallel or substantially parallel to the plane in which the load bearing surface 32 lies. Therefore, a flat surface area of the load bearing surface 32 receives a substantially uniform load pressure from a flat surface area of the portion 36a. Consequently, the transport guide 36 is preferably less likely to wobble or move relative to the transport devices of the present invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that in other embodiments not illustrated, the transport guide stabilizer of the present invention can include any suitable transport guide engagement member which engages the transport guide 36 in a removable fashion. Such transport guide engagement member need not be flat or substantially flat. For example, such transport guide engagement member can include a suitable mating member which mechanically mates with the transport guide 36, such as one or more notches, protrusions or other irregularities which mate with one or more notches.<br><br>
protrusions or irregularities of the transport guide 36. In another example, such transport guide engagement member can include a suitable fastener which removably attaches the transport guide 36 to the transport guide stabilizer 14, such as an adhesive or hook and loop type fastener. In any case, the transport guide stabilizer 14 of the present invention is configured to aid in the stability of or otherwise increase the stability of the transport guide 36.<br>
The rotatable contact member 16 of the transport device 10 can include any device or member capable of rotational movement, such as a ball, wheel or roller. In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 is a relatively large ball bearing which is rotatably supported by the friction reducing members 22 and held in place by the top portion 20b of the body 20. As illustrated in Fig. 4, an article 46 to be transported is supported by the top surface 48 of the rotatable contact member 16. As the article 46 moves across the transport device 10, the rotatable contact member 16 rotates against the friction reducing members 22,<br>
In one embodiment illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, the present invention includes a conveyor assembly 13 including: (a) a plurality of transport devices 10,10a and 10b preferably arranged in a grid or matrix configuration; and (b) a transport guide 36 supported by the transport guide stabilizers 14 (specifically, the load bearing surface 32) of the transport devices 10,10a and 10b.<br>
In the conveyor assembly 13, the transport surface engagement members of certain transport devices 10a and 10b (shown in Fig. 5) do not need to have a fastener 28 or any other fastener which secures these transport devices 10a and 10b to the conveyor surface 24, Here, the transport device receiving walls 52 of the transport guide 36 restrain or limit the movement of the transport devices 10a and 10b relative to the conveyor surface 24. Accordingly, the transport guide 36 maintains the transport devices 10a and 10b in a predetermined position during conveyor operations. Consequently, a user can replace transport devices 10a and 10b by lifting the transport guide 36, picking up the transport devices 10a and 10b and placing new transport devices in the place of transport devices 10a and 10b.<br>
The transport guide 36 is preferably a substantially flat plate 51 having a plurality of transport device receiving walls 52 which define a plurality of apertures (not shown) to receive the rotatable contact member 16 and top portion 20b of the transport device 10.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 4, an article 46 to be transported by the conveyor assembly 13 is placed upon the top portion 48 of the rotatable contact members 16 of the plurality of transport devices 10. The transport devices 10 facilitate the movement of the article 46 by providing a surface of reduced friction upon which the article 46 is transferred. As the rotatable contact members 16 rotatably engage the friction reducing members 22 of the transport devices 10, the force necessary to start and sustain the movement of an article 46 placed on the transport devices 10 is reduced.<br>
When seated on the transport guide stabilizers 14, the transport guide 36 preferably reduces the accumulation of dirt, dust or other debris in the spaces 60 between the transport devices 10. When articles 46, which may be non-rigid, may have non-uniform shapes or may be positioned at an angle relative to the conveyor structure 24, are conveyed, the transport guide 36 frmctions as an aid to stabilize the articles 46.<br>
Method of Use<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention includes a method of transporting an article including the steps of: (a) providing a plurality of transport devices 10 assembled in a pattern and mounted on a surface 24; (b) providing a transport guide stabilizer 14 on each of the transport devices 10; (c) placing a transport guide 36 on top of the transport devices 10; and (d) enabling a force to be applied to an article 46 in order to move the article 46 along the conveyor assembly 13. The transport guide 36 guides the movement of the article 46. The transport guide 36 further reduces the collection of dust and debris in the spaces 60 between the transport devices 10 which may enter the holder 12.<br>
Materials<br>
The transport devices 10 and 11, and the conveyor assembly 13 of the present invention may be manufactiu-ed from any suitable material. The rotatable contact member 16, the friction reducing members 22 and the holder 12 may be manufactured from any suitable material such as steel or other metals, polymers, plastics and/or rubber. In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 and the friction reducing members 22 are made of steel, the holder 12 is made of sheet metal and the transport<br><br>
guide 36 is made of aluminum, steel, plexiglass, stainless steel, plastic or other materials.<br>
In one embodiment, the rotatable contact member 16 is approximately one inch in diameter, and the holder 12 is approximately one inch in height and approximately two inches in width, excluding the width of the transport surface engagement member 18. The transport guide stabilizer is preferably located ^proximately one-half inch above the transport surface engagement member 18.<br>
The transport device of the present invention, in one embodiment includes a rotatable contact member supported by a holder, wherein the holder includes a transport guide stabilizer which stabilizes a substantially flat transport guide. In one embodiment, the transport guide stabilizer includes a substantially flat surface which supports the load of the transport guide. In another embodiment, the conveyor assembly of the present invention includes a plurality of transport devices assembled in a grid, and a transport guide supported by the transport guide stabilizers of the transport devices. The transport guide reduces the accumulation of dirt, dust and/or debris which may enter the holder portion of the transport devices, while simultaneously serving as an aid to stabilize transported articles which, due to their flexibility, shape or direction of motion may tend to travel along a conveyor system in an undesirable fashion. The present invention therefore enhances the stability of the transport guides in conveyor systems and increases the life of transport devices.<br>
It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br></td>
