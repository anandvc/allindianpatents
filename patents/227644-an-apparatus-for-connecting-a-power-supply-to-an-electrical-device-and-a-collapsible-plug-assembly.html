DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the electrical connecting apparatus 100 comprises a<br>
first case 110, a second case 120, and a rotary member 130. An insertion opening<br>
111 for the rotary member 130 is provided proximal to a central portion of the first<br>
case 110. A plurality of terminal-receiving grooves 112 extends from an inner<br>
circumference surface of the insertion opening 111. The first case nu couples to a<br>
second case 120 to form a receiving space therein. A boss portion 122 extends,<br>
upward from the inner surface of second case 120, as shown in Figure 4,<br>
The boss portion 122 corresponds to the insertion opening 111. A rotary<br>
member 130 is rotatably installed within the insertion opening 111 of the first case<br>
110. Slots 131 are disposed within the rotary member 130, preferable parallel to<br>
each other. Slots 131 line up with the terminal-receiving grooves 112 when the rotary<br>
member is rotated in a first direction in a predetermined or specified angle.<br>
Connection plates 140 installed at the boss portion 122 of the second case<br>
120 connect to a printed circuit board 160. A plug terminal assembly 150,<br><br>
comprising for example a pair of elongated electric terminals, is rotatably installed at<br>
a bottom portion of the rotary member 130.<br>
In one embodiment, a first portion of the assembly 150, when installed,<br>
contacts each of the connection plates 140. A second portion of the assembly 150<br>
penetrates the insertion opening 111 of the first case 110 for exposing the plug<br>
terminal assembly 150 outside of the first case 110.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 6, a finger insertion groove 113 is preferably formed at the<br>
terminal-receiving groove 111 to allow a user conveniently unfold the plug terminal<br>
assembly 150 when it is in a folded state. The finger insertion groove 113 is deep<br>
enough to allow for the tip of a user's finger to come in contact with the plug terminal<br>
assembly 150, when it is in a folded state. In a preferred embodiment, the finger<br>
insertion groove 113 is approximately 10mm wide.<br>
Referring back to Figure 4, a flange 133 is disposed around an outer edge of<br>
the rotary member 130. While inserted in the insertion opening 111, the flange 133<br>
prevents the rotary member 130 from unintentionally slipping out from the first case<br>
110.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, inside the first case 110, a stopping groove 114 is<br>
formed near the insertion opening 111. A stopper 134 is formed at an outer<br>
circumferential surface of the rotary member 130. The stopper 134 corresponds<br>
with the stopping groove 114. When a user rotates the rotary member 130 to fold or<br>
unfold the plug terminal assembly 150, a rotating angle of the rotary member 130 is<br>
restricted. Preferably, the rotary member 130 is restricted to a maximum<br>
predetermined angle. The plug terminal assembly 150 provides two elongated<br>
electric terminals: a first terminal 151 and a second terminal 152. The first and<br>
second terminals 151, 152 insert into the slots 131a, 131b of the rotary member<br>
130.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 4 and 5, a shaft 153, formed of an insulation material, for<br>
example, connects the first terminal 151 with the second terminal 152. The shaft<br>
can be rotatably inserted into a shaft groove 132 of the rotary member 130. A<br>
groove 154 is formed in the middle of the shaft 153. A protrusion 155 is formed at<br>
the rotary member 130, which corresponds with the groove 154.<br>
In the unfolded state, when the protrusion 155 is inserted in the groove 154,<br>
the plug terminal assembly 150 firmly maintains the unfolded state. First connection<br>
protrusions 156 are formed at a first end of the first and second terminals 151, 152.<br>
Second connection protrusions 141 are formed at each of the connection<br>
piates 140 corresponding to the first connection protrusions 156.<br>
In the unfolded state, the first connection protrusions 156 contact the second<br>
contact protrusions 141. A second end of each of the first and second terminals<br>
151, 152 pass through the insertion opening 111 of the first case 110 to extend<br>
outside of the first case 110. In the folded state, the first connection protrusions 156<br>
of the first and second terminals 151,152 do not contact the second connection<br>
protrusions 141.<br>
That is, the second end of each of the first and second terminals 151,152 is<br>
inserted in the terminal-receiving grooves 112, respectively. As the rotary member<br>
130 is rotated, each of the slots 131a, 131b of the rotary member 130 is aligned with<br>
a corresponding terminal-receiving groove 112, thus, allowing the folding of the plug<br>
terminal assembly 150.<br>
Referring to Figures 4-6, the procedure for folding and unfolding the. plug<br>
terminal assembly 150 is herein described. As shown in Figure 6, a plug terminal<br>
assembly 150 is depicted as dotted lines in the folded state. To unfold the plug<br>
terminal assembly 150, the user puts a finger in the finger insertion opening 113 and<br>
flips upward the first terminal 151. In this example, because the shaft 153 is<br><br>
rotatably connected with the shaft groove 132, the plug terminal assembly 150<br>
rotates about the shaft 153 so that both the first and second terminals 151, 152<br>
extend approximately vertically upward in relation to outer surface of the first unit<br>
110.<br>
When the plug terminal assembly 150 is completely rotated, the protrusion<br>
155 is inserted in the groove 154, thereby firmly maintaining the unfolded state of<br>
the plug terminal assembly 150. As a user rotates the plug terminal assembly 150 in<br>
a clockwise direction, for example, the rotary member 130 rotates clockwise. The<br>
slots 131 of the rotary member 130 become distally located from the terminal-<br>
receiving grooves 112 causing a contact to be maintained between the first contact<br>
protrusions 153 and the second contact protrusions 141. In the unfolded state, a<br>
support portion 112 supports the plug terminal assembly 150, thereby firmly<br>
maintaining the unfolded state.<br>
To change the plug terminal assembly 150 from the unfolded to the folded<br>
state, the user rotates the plug terminal assembly 150 counterclockwise, for<br>
example.<br>
The rotary member 130 rotates in a counter-clockwise direction a result. The<br>
slots 131 of the rotary member 130 align with the terminal-receiving grooves 113. In<br>
the folded state, the first contact protrusions 153 do not contact the second contact<br>
protrusions 141. Consequently, when a user presses on the first terminal 151 or the<br>
second terminal 152, the plug terminal assembly 150 rotates about the shaft 153<br>
because the shaft 153 is rotatably inserted in the shaft groove 132 of the rotary<br>
member 130. When the plug terminal assembly 150 is completely rotated, the first<br>
terminal 151 and the second terminal 152 are received in the terminal-receiving<br>
grooves 113.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 7, the electrical connecting apparatus 200 in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention comprises a first case 210, a<br>
second case 220, and a rotary member 230. The first case 210 has an insertion<br>
opening 211 proximate to the center. In addition, the first case 210 has a plurality of<br>
terminal-receiving grooves 213 extending outward from the inner circumference of<br>
the insertion opening 211. The first case 210 is coupled to the second case 220 to<br>
form a receiving space.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, a boss portion 222, in this example ring-shaped,<br>
extends from interior surface of the second case 220 to correspond with the<br>
insertion opening 211. A rotary member 230 is rotatably installed within the<br>
insertion opening 211 of the first case 210. Slots 231 are disposed within the rotary<br>
member 230 and correspond to the terminal-receiving grooves 21. Connection<br>
plates 240 are installed at both sides of the boss portion 222 of the second case<br>
220. The connection plates 240 contact a printed circuit board 260 and a plug<br>
terminal assembly 250 inserted in the rotary member 230.<br>
One end (lower portion) of the rotary member 230 contacts each of the<br>
connection plates 240. The other end (upper portion) of the rotary plate 230 passes<br>
through the insertion opening 211 of the first case 210 so as to pass through outside<br>
of the first case 210. A terminal support member 270, installed in the boss portion<br>
222, rotatably supports the plug terminal assembly 250. Preferably, a finger<br>
insertion groove 213 is formed at the terminal-receiving groove 211 so that a user<br>
may conveniently fold or unfold the plug terminal assembly 250.<br>
As for a structure of the rotary member 230, a flange 233 is formed around an<br>
outer circumference of the rotary member 230. The flange 233 secures the rotary<br>
member 230 while rotatably inserted in the insertion opening 211 to the first case<br>
210.<br><br>
A stopping groove 214 is formed inside the first case 210 near the insertion<br>
opening 211. At an outer circumferential surface of the rotary member 230, a<br>
stopper 234 is formed to correspond with the stopping groove 214. When a user<br>
rotates the rotary member 230 to fold or unfold the plug terminal assembly 250, a<br>
rotating angle of the rotary member 230 is restricted, namely, the rotary member 230<br>
may be rotated only up to a specified angle.<br>
The plug terminal assembly 250 includes two terminals: a first terminal 251<br>
and a second terminal 252. The first terminal 251 and the second terminal 252 are<br>
inserted in the slots 231 of the rotary member 230. A shaft 253 formed of an<br>
insulation material, for example, connects the first terminal 251 with the second<br>
terminal 252. A connection protrusion 256 is formed at first end of each of the first<br>
and second terminals 251 and 252. A plurality of connection grooves 241, which are<br>
formed at each connection plate 240, correspond to the connection protrusion 256.<br>
In the unfolded state of the plug terminal assembly 250, the connection protrusions<br>
256 of the first and second terminals 251 and 252 elastically contact the connection<br>
grooves 241. Second ends of each of the first and second terminals 251, 252<br>
detachably insert into the insertion opening 211 to extend outside of the first case<br>
210.<br>
In the folded state of the plug terminal assembly 250, the contact protrusions<br>
256 of the first and second terminals 251, 252 do not contact the connection<br>
grooves 241. In the folded state, the end portions of the first and second terminals<br>
251, 252 are inserted in the terminal-receiving grooves 212 of the first case 210.<br>
As a user rotates the rotary member 230, each of the slots 231 of the rotary<br>
member 230 are selectively aligned with terminal-receiving grooves 212 of the first<br>
case 210, thereby providing for folding of the plug terminal assembly 250. A shaft<br>
222a is preferably formed at the central location of the boss portion 222. A shaft<br><br>
hole 271 is formed at the center of the terminal support member 270, corresponding<br>
to the shaft 222a. Coupling rings 272 are formed at sides of the terminal support<br>
member 270. Coupling rings 272 insert along the end of the shaft 253 of the plug<br>
terminal assembly 250. A support portion 222b is formed at the boss portion 222.<br>
The support portion 222b supports the unfolded state of the plug terminal<br>
assembly 250.<br>
Referring to Figures 9 and 10, operation of the electrical connecting<br>
apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.<br>
As shown, a dotted line in Figure 10 depicts the plug terminal assembly 250 in a<br>
folded state.<br>
To move the plug terminal assembly 250 from the folded state to the unfolded<br>
state, a user inserts his/her finger in the finger insertion opening 213 and pulls the<br>
first terminal 251 in an upward fashion. Because the shaft 253 is rotatably inserted<br>
in the rings 272 of the terminal support member 270, the plug terminal assembly 250<br>
rotates about the shaft 253.<br>
When the user rotates the plug terminal assembly 250 in a clockwise<br>
direction, for example, the rotary member 230 and the terminal support member 270<br>
rotate clockwise. Afterwards, the slots 231 of the rotary member 230 from the<br>
terminal-receiving grooves 213 elastically contact the contact protrusions 256 while<br>
being secured within the contact grooves 241. The support portion 222b, which is<br>
formed at the boss portion 222, and the contact grooves 241, serve to firmly<br>
maintain the unfolded state of the plug terminal assembly 250.<br>
To change to the folded state from the unfolded state, which is depicted in<br>
Figure 10 as a solid line, a user rotates the plug terminal assembly 250<br>
counterclockwise, for example, to rotate the rotary member 230 in a<br>
counterclockwise direction. The slots 231 of the rotary member 230 are linearly<br><br>
aligned with the terminal-receiving grooves 212. In the folded state, the contact<br>
protrusions 256 are maintained to prevent contact the terminal-receiving grooves<br>
212.<br>
If the user presses down on the first terminal 251 or the second terminal 252, the<br>
plug terminal assembly 270 is rotated about the shaft 253 because the shaft 253 is<br>
rotatably inserted in the rings 271 of the terminal support member 270. When the<br>
plug terminal assembly 270 is completely rotated, the first terminal 251 or the<br>
second terminal 252 is received in the terminal-receiving grooves 212. As the first<br>
terminal 251 or the second terminal 252 is received in the terminal-receiving grooves<br>
