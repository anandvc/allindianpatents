PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>

BACKGROUND<br>
/.   Technical Field<br>
This application generally relates to the field of wireless communication systems, and more particularly to establishing communication parameters for access terminals used in such systems.<br>
2.   Background Art<br>
Subject matter set forth herein is applicable to wireless comminication systems generally. However, it has been developed in the context of CDMA cellular telecommunication systems that provide high-speed connectivity including data and voice transport on both point-to-point and point-to-mullipoint bases. First-generation (analog) and second-generation (digital) cellular networks were used primarily for communicating voice traffic via mobile cellular telephones, and thus maintained a focu3 on access methods for the efficient transport of voice information. With the rising popularity of the Internet, a third-generation (30) wideband multimedia cellular network continues to be developed to transport both voice and data at much higher speeds than were available using the first and second generation wireless networks.<br>
Wireless Communication Standards Related to the Present Disclosure<br>
A Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) has been established by industry groups for the purpose of defining specifications to transition current code-division multiple-access (CDMA)  wireless  networks  to   the  mud  generation,  which  in  commonly  referred  to  as<br>
2.<br><br>
cdma2OOO". The 3GPP2 is primarily concerned with defining specifications for CDMA systems such as are implemented in North America. A document specifying a somewhat different CDMA system, such as is used more commonly in Europe, may be identified as 3GPP TSG-RAN Release-5, and is hereby incorporated by reference for its teachings on CDMA systems. Also incorporated by reference is so much of 3GPP TSG-PAN ReIease-6 as has been made public, particularly including documents submitted in conjunction therewith and identified as R1-031268, RJ-040534, and Rl-040758.<br>
As described in a document entitled "Introduction to cdma2000 Standards for Spread Spectrum .Systems", available from the 3GPP2 in a document number C.S0001-D, published by the 3GPP2 in February, 2004, the "cdma2000 family of specifications" specifies a spread spectrum radio interface that uses well known Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless transmission techniques in order to meet the requirements for 3G wireless communications. The C.S0001-D document is incorporated by reference herein in its entuety. As described in the incorporated C.S0001-D reference, ihe- cdma2000 family of standards includes specifications for the following aspects of the cdma2000 third generation wireless communication system: core air interface, minimum performance, and service standards. The cdma2000 core air interface standards are publicly available from the 3GPP2 as follows: C.SOOOl-D, Introduction to cdma2000 Standards for Spread Spectrum Systems, February, 2004; C.S0002-D, Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems, February, 2004; C.S0003-D, Medium Access Control (AL4C) Standard for cdma2000 Spread Specmim Systems, February, 2004; C.S0004-D, Signaling Link Access Control (LiC) Standard for cdma2000 Spread SpeetrtimSystems, February, 2004; and C.S0005-D, Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems, February, 2004. hi addition, the family includes a standard that specifies analog operation, to support dual-mode mobile stations and base stations. This standard is publicly available from the 3GPP2 as document number C.S0006-D, Aiuk-g Signaling Standard for cdma200Q Spread Spectrum Systems, February, 2004. All of the above standards are collectively referred to herein as the "cdma2000 family of standards", and are hereby incorporated hereui as though set forth in full for their teachings on cdma2000 standards.<br>
The cdma2000 family of standards allows seamless evolution from cdma2000 lx systems to cdrna2000 "1xEV-DO" (lx Evolution, Dara Only or Sata-Optimized") and CDMA2000 IxEV-DV (lx Evohition. Data and Voice) systems. The first phase of cdma2000, cdma2000 lx systems enabled operators with existing IS-95 systems to double overall system capacity. These systems offer 3G type services at speeds up to 140 lebps peak data rate while occupying a very small amount of frequency spectrum (1.25 MHZ per carrier). The cdma2000 lx systems are designed for increased voice capacity and support "always-on" data transmission of approximately 153.6 kbps on both the forward and reverse links. The edma2000 lx systems were first deployed in October, 2000.<br>
3<br><br>
In 2OO4, the cdma2000 lxEV-DO Revision A (or "R.evA") specification was approved by the 3GPP2 Technical Specificaiion Group. Revision A is optimized for packet data service, and supports peak data rates of 3.1 Mbps on the forward link and up to l.S Mbps on die reverse link. The high data rates on the reverse link and low data latency enable operators to deliver rich multimedia sen-ices, such as video telephony, and enhance user experience. Revision A is an enhanced version of lxEV-DO Release 0 (or "P.evO"), which delivers up to 2.4 Mbps data speeds and has been commercially deployed since 2002. These systems are also referred to by the 3GPP2 aa High Rate Packet Data systems, or "HRPD" systems, in (die developing edma2000 family of standards. Standards defining these HRPD systems are available from die 3GPP2.<br>
For example, the standard defining the lxEV-DO RevO HRPD system is set forth in 3GPP2 document number C.S0024-0 (Versions "V 2.0", "V 3.0" and "V4.0") entitled cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specificaiion, dated October 27, 2000 for Version V 2.0), December 5. 2001 (for Version V 3.0), and October 25. 2002 (for Version V 4.0). The standard defining the lxEV-DO RevA HRPD system is set forth in 3GPP2 document number C.S0024-A (Versions 1.0 and 2.0, dated March 2004 and July 2005, respectively), also entitled "cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification". Both of these standards include technical requirements for providing compatibility with cdma2000 HRPD systems. These standards set forth technical requirements that ensure that a compliant Access Terminal ("AT") can obtain service through any access network that conforms to the standards. All of the HRPD air interface specifications set forth above are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full.<br>
In addition to 'die HRPD standards cited above, 3GPP2 document numbers A.S0007-0 (version V 1.0), A.S0007-0 (Version V 2.0), A.S0007-A (versions V 1.0 and V 2.0) and A.SOOOS-0 (version V 3.0) all describe an inter-operability specification for a Radio Access Network (RAN) that supports HRPD. These specifications contain message procedures and formats necessary to obtain interoperability. Document numbers A.S0007-A (version V 2.0), entitled Interoperability Specification (IOS) for High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) Access Network Interfaces - Rev A, Revision A (Tost SDO Ballot, Pre-SDO Publication Version), dated May, 2003 (TIA-IS78), and A.SOOOS-0 (Version V 3.0), entitled Interoperability Specification (IOS) for High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) Access Network Interfaces - Revision 0 (Post SDO Ballot, Pre-SDO Publication Version), dated May 2003, (TIA-S7S-1) supersede the standards noted above. All of the HRPD interoperability specifications set forth above are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full.<br>
The specification that is the most relevant to the advances set form herein may be identified as either lxEV-DO Rel. B, and the same specification may also be identified as IS-856-Rel. B. This specification, however nominated, and other standards related to cdma2000 compatible HRPD systems, should be publicly available from the 3GPP2, and are all incorporated by reference<br>
4<br><br>
herein in their entireties. 3GPP2 document number C.S0054-0, Version V 2.0, entitled CDMA2000 High Rate Broadatst-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification, dated July, 2005, sets forth technical requirements that form the compatibility standard for cdma2000 broadcast high rate packet data systems. These technical requirements ensure that a compliant access terminal (AT) can obtain service through any access network conforming to the standard. The C.S0054-0, Version V 2.0 document is also hereby incorporated by reference herein m though set fordi in full.<br>
As is well known, the use of automatic retransmission protocols that operate within a "physical" communication layer, such as the Hybrid Automatic Retransmission reQuest (H-ARQ) protocols, may enhance the efficiency of wireless data transmissions such as those defined by the HRPD specifications cited above. When a transmitting station (TS) transmits a packet to a receiving station (RS), H-ARQ procedures generally require the RS to promptly transmit an acknowledgment signal back to the TS to indicate whether the packet transmission was successful (ACK) or not (NACK). It is well known that H-ARQ protocols may provide significant gains when operating packet data channels.<br>
Problems Associated With to the Present RevO and RevA HRPD Systems<br>
The IxEV-DO RevO and RevA HRPD systems cited above may be referred to as "Ix" systems, because they only support a single 1.25 MHz carrier. The 3GPP2 is currently developing standards for an evolved HRPD system that will be capable of supporting multiple carriers. The evolved HRPD system, sometimes referred to as an NxEV-DO system, and referred to herein as an "HRPD RevB" or "Nx HRPD" system (as contrasted with the HRPD RevA system defined by the above-incorporated lxEV-DQ RevA HRPD standard), can operate using multiple carriers, each occupying a different frequency spectrum (e.g., a number "N" of 1,25 MHz carriers). The HRPD RevB system is therefore referred to as an "Nx system" to indicate that it supports multiple different-frequency carriers. Presently, the 3GPP2 is defining the RevB system to support between 1 and 15 1.25 MH- carriers. When a RevB system (also referred to as an "NxDO" system) device is operated in an N=l (i.e., "lx") mode, it defaults to RevA functionality (i.e., it must be compatible with the above-incorporated RevA HRPD standards).<br>
One of the benefits provided by the HRPD RevB Nx systems is an ability to process forward links and/or reverse linl:s ou each of N carriers and, as a result, increase system peal: data rates by a factor of "N". Additional benefits provided by the Nx HRPD systems are made possible, for example, due to the operations of the Nx scheduler. In Nx HRPD systems, the scheduler can be used to exploit frequency selectivity, relative carrier loading, etc. The Nx scheduler can schedule an optimal data rate/user on each of the supported carriers and, as a consequence, increase overall system throughput, decrease latency for a particular application, and improve overall user experience.<br>
5<br><br>
However, the benefits provided by the Nx HRPD (also referred to herein as HRPD RevB) systems come at some cost. In general, system complexity and. costs increase with an increase in the number "N" of carriers supported by the HRPD RevB systems. More specifically, the. Access Terminal (AT) becomes increasingly more complex and costly as "N" increases. This increase in system complexity grows more or leas linearly with the number of carriers "N" supported by the system.<br>
Therefore., a need exists for a method and apparatus providing Nx carrier support without incurring all the burdens of complexity and cost that are presently entailed by such Nx carrier support. Such a method or apparatus should allow specific 3G applications and services to benefit from the features and functions permitted by Nx HRPD systems, yet permit implementation using multi-carrier wireless communication system Access Terminals (ATs) that; have reduced hardware requirements compared to present solutions. Such multi-carrier cominication system ATs should ideally be relatively inexpensive to manufacture, yet permit flexible, reeonfiguinple operation to make efficient use of the hardware, resources provided in the ATs.<br>
The methods and apparatus described herein address the above-described problems and goals, and alleviate other difficulties as well.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
A method, apparatus, and system are disclosed that enable an Access Terminal ("AT") capable of multiple earrier (Nx HRPD) operation in a wireless communications system to be implemented with reduced hardware requirements, reduced complexity, and/or with increased flexibility of resource allocation forNx operation, as compared to an AT implemented in accordance with prior art methods or apparatus. The AT will support data reception from a Base Station (BS) concurrently on N different carriers (N &gt; 1); however, it may limit throughput and/or data-rate capacity on one or more of the N carriers so that data communications can proceed efficiently in view of the hardware resource limits of the AT. Buffer memory is an example of an AT hardware resource that may be too limited to permit maximum-rate data communications on all N carriers. Many different restrictions may be imposed to limit throughput and/or data rates no as to avoid running out of a limited resource (e.g., buffer memory), but in a preferred embodiment, reception may be suspended on one or more of a plurality of interlaced Hybrid Acknowledgment Retransmission reQuest (H-ARQ) channels, for one or more of the N carriers. Moreover, values for N, and for one or more other relevant parameters such as the number of supported H-ARQ channels, may be communicated to the BS in an appropriate message, and may be dynamically recorrfigurable. Thereby, as circumstances change, tradeoffs can be made to permit efficient use of the hardware<br>
6<br><br>
resources of (he AT, such as buffer memory, while communicating concurrently via a plurality of carriers. Consequently, a relatively simple -and modestly provisioued AT may be configured to provide at least some of the befits associated with plural-carrier (Nx) data communications.<br>
One embodiment is a method of establishing parameters to govern data comnurnications between a BS and an AT The method includes determining values for and rp for a particular AT, where n is a number of different-frequency carriers on which the AT is configured to concurreudy receive data, and iv is another parameter ihal limits a data reception rate on at least one of the n carriers. The method also includes cornrmmicating to the BS the values of n and rp currently determined for the AT, and consequently receiving data from the BS at the AT on no more than n different-frequency carriers and at a rate limited by rp, cuch that au AT hardware resource that would be inadequate for proper operation for at least one other selectable value of rp is adequate with the determined value of rp. Appropriate values of n and rp may be dynamically reconiigurable, may be determined by the AT, and/or may vary based on other factors affecting data rates on particular carriers, such as the modulation and coding techniques that are then permitted. The parameter rp may represent, for from one to all of the n carriers, a number of interleaved H-ARQ channels within which data packets m?y be communicated between the BS and the AT.<br>
Another embodiment is a method of balancing resource allocation in an AT that includes selecting a number n of carriers for data communications between the AT and a BS. The method also includes identifying a limited resource of the AT whose usage depends on n and on other reception parameters np(k), and determining an appropriate value xl for a first rp(l). A value xl is appropriate if the limited resource is sufficient for data communications on all n carriers for rp(I) = xl, but would be insufficient if -RP(I) were set to a value x2, as may happen under some circumstances. The method includes comniunicaling the appropriate values for n and rp(l) to the BS to serve as limits on those parameters for data communications between the AT and the BS. It may be required that new values of n and rp(I) be subsequently determined aud communicated to the BS. The parameter rp(I) may constrain a rate of packet data communication, and may in particular specify a limit on a number of time-division multiplexed H-ARQ channels on which data packets will be communicated between the AT and the BS on one, some, or all of the n carriers. The limited AT resource mav be required to be buffer memory, and the AT may be required to perform the steps of this method.<br>
A further embodiment is a transceiver apparatus operable as an AT to concurrently receive data packets from a BS via n &gt; 1 carriers in non-overlapping frequency bands. When operating, the transceiver includes a reception parameter rp that is sellable to a plurality of different selectable values, and which affects a maximum rate of data communication between the BS and the AT on at least one carrier. It also includes a data processing resource that is needed in a quantity that<br>
7<br><br>
is a function of a and rp for proper data packet communication between the AT and the BS, as well as a resource balancing module. The resource balancing module is configured to accept a value for one of n and rp, and to determine a value for the other of n and rp such that data packets may be properly communicated between the AT and the BS using K and rp witliout requiring more of the data processing resource than is available within the AT. The transceiver may, when operating, farther be required to include a messaging module configured to communicate the determined values of n and rp to the BS. The data processing resoiuce may be required to be available buffer memory, or may be another resource. The parameter rp may be required to specify one of a maximum coding rate, a maximum-rate modulation scheme, and a number of interlaced H-ARQ channels on which data packets may be communicated between the AT and the BS, or it may be required to be the number of H-ARQ channels to be used, whether for one earner, or for more carriers, or for all n carriers.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have observed that most of the practical applications that will benefit from multi-carrier data communication in HRPD RevB systems may not require, the maximum peak data rate provided by simple concatenation of the full capacities of several RF carriers. Many devices targeted for specific applications, such as "Voice over IP" (VoIP), Video Telephony, etc., do not require extremely high peak date rates, yet still may benefit from the other features and functions enabled by CDMA communication over a plurality of different-frequency carriers.<br>
8<br><br>
FIGURE 1 is a simplified diagram showing the basic H-ARQ single carrier IxEV-DO Forward Link Interlace channel structure. As shown in FIGURE 1, four (4) H-ARQ channels i, i+l, i+2 and i+-3 are "interlaced" to provide ARQ timing in which successive sub-packets for a given H-ARQ channel are transmitted at fixed intervals. For each H-ARQ channel, this timing enables the reception status of one subpacket to be reported (ACK or NACK) to the transmitting station before the next packet for that channel must be sent. Each subpacket n+/ may be new, or may be a partial or complete retransmission of the preceding subpacket n on that particular H-ARQ chamiel. Which of these should be sent must be determined by the data source transmitter in accordance with the ACK feedback status provided from the receiving station. Tlte .lelay between subpacket n and subpacket n-'-l on a given H-ARQ channel, illustrated in FIGURE 3 as three slot durations, is sufficient to permit the receiving station to determine the appropriate ACK status for subpacket n, to convey that status to the transmitting station, and for the transmitting station to select the appropriate subpacket u+1 in response to the ACK status. Thereby, for H-ARQ channel /, subpacket n in slot 102 is followed by subpacket n+l in slot 110, which may, for example, be a retransmission of subpacket n if acknowledgment was negative (NACK). Physical layer data packets are typically distributed among successive sub-packets on a given H-ARQ channel.<br>
Subpacket,n of H-ARQ channel / is transmitted during a slot 102. During a next slot, 104, subpacket n of a second H-ARQ channel i+l is transmitted. Subpacket u of H-ARQ channel /-i-2 is transmitted during a next slot 106, and subpacket n for ihe last H-ARQ channel l+3 is transmitted during a next slot 108. The subpackets of each H-ARQ channel are generally independent of subpackets of each other H-ARQ channel. At a slot 110, the next subpacket (n+l) of H-ARQ channel i is transmitted. Similarly, the n+l subpackets for H-ARQ channels /+/ and n+2 are transmitted during slots 112 and 114, respectively. Thus, the different H-ARQ channels are "interlaced" with each other.<br>
Forward link (FL) traffic transmitted as data packets from a Base Station (BS) to an Access Terminal (AT) receiver is described first. Each of the H-ARQ channels illustrated in FIGURE 1 is generally transmitting independent data packets. During each successive interlace period shown in FIGURE I, the receiver AT must store and process all data that it receives on the forward link (FL) traffic channel. The receiver AT must store data representing the signals that it receives during each slot until it can determine that the data represented by the signals has been correctly received. For some communication protocols (his may require retaining raw signal data until a number of successive subpackets have been sent. Once the- data represented by a subpacket has been correctly received, the data must be retained and concatenated with subsequent subpacket data until accurate reception of the entire packet is confirmed. The receiver AT must thus store a large amount of data.<br>
9<br><br>
As defined in the l;tEV-DO RevA standard (previously incorporated by reference), the AT receiver must support all four interfaces in order to provide a maximum peak data rate of 3.1 Mbps. The maximum packet size on the FL for HRPD RevA systems comprises 6144 symbols; in order to support this requirement. the terminal receiver symbol memory is as follows:<br>
Symbol_Buffer = 4 interlaces * 6144 symbols * 8 bit/symbol = 196,603 bits.<br>
A similar requirement easts on the Reverce Link (RL). On the ILL, the terminal must support three interlaced H-AP.O channel; with maximum packet size o£ 12288 bits and a maximum transmit data rate of 1.8 Mbps.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates a basic FL H-ARQ Interlace channel structure for multiple carrier NxEV-DO (or HRPD P.evB) CDMA, packet data communication. As shown in FIGURE 2, the terminal receives data on each interlace up to the maximum packet she/rate on each of the N different-frequency carriers that it supports. For each of N carriers, during successive slots 202, 204, 206 and 208, the four H-ARQ channels i to i+3 (described with respect to FIGURE I) each receive their with subpacket. During the next successive slots 210, 212 and 214, the first three H-ARQ channels receive subpaekets n+1, and this process continues for all of the interlaced H-ARQ channels on each of the N carriers.<br>
As should be apparent from comparing FIGURE 2 to FIGURE 1, the data that must be received, stored, and processed by the terminal increases linearly with an increase iu N. For example, with N=4, the data rate provided to the terminal is greater than 12 mbps on the FL and 7 mbps on the RL. More than 835 lints of symbol memory is therefore required to support NxEV-DO operation for N = 4, according to the standards that were proposed or adopted prior to the advances described herein.<br>
As noted above, most practical applications do not require the very high peal: data rates provided by the developing HRPD RevB systems. Consequently, in many practical applications, the high costs associated with previously proposed HRPD RevA and RevB ATs are not justified. However, it will be useful to enable an AT to obtain some of the benefits of NxEV-DO systems without incurring all of the costs and complexity entailed by previous proposals for such systems. The method and apparatus described herein permit an AT having reduced cost and complexity, and consequently having resources too limited to support multi-carrier HRPD operation as previously proposed, to support some features of multi-carrier operation by trading off other features in a new manner. The result is a system that can flexibly support ATs with a variety of different multi-carrier capabilities. Indeed, the tradeoffs can be made dynamically configurable so that an AT can efficiently redeploy limited resources as conditions change.<br>
10<br><br>
In order to achieve this goal, in .some embodiments a set of parameters are used to separately select, or define a relationship between, (a) the number of supported FL or RL carriers, and (b) another parameter that can be constrained to reduce the quantity of a particular limited resource, hi a particular preferred example, the. limited resource is memory, particularly symbol memory, and the number of interlaced H-ARQ channels to be supported for a carier is the other parameter. A set of messages is also defined to convey values of such parameter sets for associated ATs. Such messages need not be communicated only at call set-up, but may allow dynamic reconfiguration of the ATs as needed.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an exemplary H-ARQ multiple carrier Forward Link Interlace channel structure- 300 in accordance with die present teachings. H-ARQ subpacket support is shown for a first supported carrier. Carrier I 302, and for an Nth supported carrier, Carrier N 304, during seven slots as indicated by reference numbers 306 - 318. Only H-ARQ channels i -ind l+2 are supported for each of the illustrated carriers; thus, each illustrated carrier supports two interlaces (1=2). T is, in mis case, a parameter that indicates the'number of supported H-ARQ interlaces for each supported channel. For the illustrated FL, the maximum value of I = 4. By changing I from a maximum selectable value, 4, to a constrained value, 2, for each supported carrier, die total amount of symbol memory required is reduced by about half. Thus, if an AT has symbol memory resources that are too limited to support all four possible H-ARQ interlaces for all N supported carriers, a reduced value of I may be selected that permits N carriers to be supported using only the limited symbol memory resource of the AT. ATs designed in accordance with such a configuration will be compatible with both HRPD RevA and RevB systems, yet will not require so much symbol memory as would previously have been required.<br>
If FIGURE 3 were consistent with previous proposals for Nx operation, then all of the II-ARQ channels would receive subpaekets for each of the N supported carriers, including H-ARQ channels /+/ and i+3, which would receive subpackets during the indicated slots 310, 312 and 316. FIGURE 3 illustrates one alternative for disabling some H-ARQ channels: each of the N carriers is enabled to receive on only I H-ARQ channels. However, if simplicity is not essential, I need not have the same value for each carrier, but may have a value independently determined for each carrier. Thus, there may be N values of I, referenced as values L1- -1N. Moreover, the same H-ARQ channels need not be enabled in respect of each carrier, except to enhance simplicity. Not only the number of supported H-ARQ channels may be independently determined for each carrier, but which particular H-ARQ channels are enabled may also be independently determined for each carrier. In that case, the N variables I; - Lv. become vectors I1 - IN that include information as to exactly which H-ARQ channels are enabled for each of the N supported carriers.<br>
II<br><br>
It should be noted that other resources, besides symbol memory, and other performance parameters besides "I" may be traded off. Examples of other limited AT resources that may be accommodated by adjustment of a performance parameter, besides memory, include Turbo decoder performance capacity and/or other signal processing resources. Total transmit power capacity may be an example of a limiting resource for transmission purposes Examples of other performance parameters that may be construed to enable N-earrier communication in view of a limiting resource, include: modulation scheme, coding rate, other data-rate factors, and H-ARQ channel assignment versus carrier. Although the supported interlaces value "I" applied, above, to all N supported carriers, an independent value of I may instead be provided .for each supported carrier.<br>
FIGURE 4 illustrates a general method for enabling multi-carrier eorimiunication between BSs and an AT that is constrained by a limited resource. FIGURE 4 presumes that the number of carriers to be supported is selected first; however, the converse situation is described subsequently. The metliod begins at a block 402, where a number of earners to be supported is selected as parameter n. Proceeding to a block 404, a limiting resource is selected. The selection may be implicit if only one limiting resource can be accommodated. The available quantity of symbol memoiy is a good example of a limiting resource that may be accommodated by the. metliod of FIGURE 4. Proceeding to a block 406, a parameter is selected that may be varied to limit usage of the limiting resource. For example, rp may indicate the number of H-ARQ channel interlaces that will be supported on one- or more carriers.<br>
The metliod may then proceed to a block 408, in which an appropriate value for rp is calculated. Given the "Pesoureses Limit" value of the limited resource, in the block 403 the parameter tp may be found as a function of the Resource Limit and of n. For example, given an available symbol memoiy size S and a symbol memory requirement R for each H-ARQ channel, if rp is the number of H-ARQ interlaces to be supported it may be determined as rp 
The value for rp may be the integer part of S/R/H, and may then be used for all n carriers. However, a fractional remainder of the memory capacity may be usefully employed by increasing rp for one or more of (he n supported carriers, thus increasing data throughput somewhat. Innumerable other methods for implementing the calculation of block 40S are possible, and a slalled person will readily determined a calculation appropriate for the particular circumstances.<br>
Returning to FIGURE 4, in a block 410 the determined values for n and rp may be commnunicated to (he serving Base Station (BS). The conununication may employ a Capability Message, such as set forth in more detail below. The BS may then transmit and/or receive data packets to or from the AT in accordance with the determined values of n and rp. The limiting resource, will be sufficient for such communication if the calculation of block 408 has been properly made.  Finally, the system may be made flexibly responsive to ehauges, whether in the number of<br>
12<br><br>
carriers to be supported, or in channel capacity conditions, or othenvise. In a block 414, the conditions that might affect the needed value for n are observed, and changes may indicate a need to select a new value for n. If yes, the method would proceed to the block 402. If no, then the method repeats the step(s) of the block 414.<br>
FIGURE 4, as described above, illustrates a method in which a number n of camera that are to be supported is selected first. Based on that selection, a corresponding parameter ip is selected so that the n carriers can be supported despite some particular resource limit. The method of FIGURE 4 may be performed iteratively for each of a plurality of different limiting resources, and/or for a plurality of different supported carriers.<br>
The method of FIGURE 4, as described above, may be further generalised by reversing n and rp, such thai a number n of carriers that can be supported is determined as a function of a limiting resource in combination with a selected limiting parameter tp. According to such a reversal, the various blocks would be redefined as follows: at block 402, a desirable parameter ip is selected for influencing rerouree usage (such as the number "I" of supported H-AR.Q interlaces per carrier). At blocl: 404, the limiting resource (.such as available symbol memory) is selected. At block 406, a resource usage-affecting parameter for which a value is to be determined (such as the number n of carriers to be supported) is selected. At block 403, calculations v/ould determine a value for the resource usage-affecting parameter: for example, finding n = [(rp, Resource Limit). Blocks 410 and 412 are unchanged, but block 414 would test whether a new value of rp is desired.<br>
Configuration Capability Message:<br>
As noted above, a set of parameters and messages may be defined to implement a reduced complexity and/or reduced cost Access Terminal (AT). For example, a "Configuration Capability Message" may be transmitted by the AT during an initiation of a session. In one exemplary embodiment, the Configuration Capability Message has the format shown below in Table 1:<br><br>

The configuration capability message and capability change message may, as illustrated, be substantially identical to each other in form, but they need not be. Any reasonable technique may be used to communicate the required parameters. Additionally or alternatively, da(a-rate constrains other than the number of supported H-ARQ channels may be made configurable to accommodate multi-carrier operation of an AT having one or more limiting resources. Such data-rate constraints may be communicated by ordinary protocols that are typically used for setting such parameters. Modulation scheme and coding rate, for example, are varied in many situations in response to changing conditions, such as channel quality or signal .strength, and ordinary protocols exist for conveying such changes.<br>
Alternatively, a special message may be used to set a "global" limit on values for such parameters. Such global limits may serve as a final value limit that is imposed on (lie corresponding parameters irrespective of other calculations. Thereby, ordinary processing and modification of such parameters may proceed normally, independent of such selectable overall or "global" limits. An appropriate message may be analogous to the messages described above, with additional fields for conveying global limits on additional data-rate constraining parameters.<br>
The message(s) used to set up and/or change the configuration may be made more complex. For example, rather than a single parameter for Number of FLInterlaces, each message may include a separate value for each supported carrier. Alternatively, capability change messages may be modified to apply to only one carrier at a time. For example, each change message may identify not a number of FLCarriers, but rather a particular FLCarrier number, and similarly identify a particular RLCarrier number rather than a number of PXCarriers. According to such alternative, a separate change message would be communicated for each carrier whose configuration is to be changed. Innumerable further messaging alternatives may be readily developed to achieve a desired level of AT flexibility or simplicity.<br>
Access Terminal Apparatus<br>
An AT embodiment need comprise only conventional hardware, but must have certain performance capabilities when operating. Thus, the AT may be defined by the presence, when operating, of parameters, resources, and functional "modules" (hat comprise hardware and software sufficient to implement required features. The art of manufacUuing CDMA wireless transceivers is well understood, and will continue to develop into the foreseeable future. As such, persons skilled in this art are readily able to design and fabricate ATs that coordinate various hardware features under software or firmware control to establish any practical, functional module that is desired. Thus, the implementations of particular modules, resources, and parameters need not be restricted, but rather an<br>
15<br><br>
A T snouici be aeruiea as an embodiment according to the functions it is designed, as an operating whole, to perform or facilitate.<br>
An AT embodiment must be able to communicate data concurrently on a plurality n of different-frequency earners, using CDMA protocols for (lie data communications. Aside from the parameter n, the AT must include at least one other parameter, which may be designated rp without loss of generality. In some embodiments, a value taken on by the rp parameter must affect a maximum rate for data communicated between the AT and a Base Station (BS) on at least one carrier. For example, rp may indicate a number "I" of H-AP.Q interlaced channels that will be supported on one or more of then currently-supported caniers. Reducing (he number of supported H-ARQ channels for any particular supported earner reduces the maximum data rate on such carrier, other aspects being equal, and thus reduces the amount of certain AT resources needed to correctly process data on that carrier. Symbol memory buffer is an example of a data processing resource that is needed for proper communication between the AT and a BS. Setting rp to reflect a lower value for "I" enables more caniers to be concurrently supported by the limited resource of interest (e.g., symbol buffer) that is available. Many embodiments of such an AT will require a balancing module to determine an appropriate value for rp as a Amotion of a given value, of n and the availability of the limited resource, or to determine an appropriate value of n for a given value of ip and a lmiiting resource size.<br>
In some embodiments, the parameter rp may reflect constraints on data rate oilier than a number of H-ARQ interlace channels supported. For example, coding rate, modulation scheme, and other CDMA characteristics, may be constrained to reduce the maximum data rate, thereby reducing some of the need for certain limited resources. A plurality of different limitations may be placed on data rate, such as a combination of coding rate, modulation scheme and "I" together. The limitations on data rate may be selected to apply to one carrier, to a plurality of carriers, or to all n currently-suDDOrted carriers.<br>
Many embodiments of an AT consistent with the description above will benefit from additional features. For example, the AT may be required to include a messaging module configured to communicate values of n and rp to the BS. A configuration capability message, and/or a configuration change message, as described above, may be required as part of such a messaging module. Such messaging can be used to permit dynamically adaptive reconfiguratiou, thus taldng optimal advantage of the luiiited-availability resource.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The foregoing description illustrates exemplary implementations, and novel features, of a method, apparatus, or system that permits implementation of a reduced complexity access terminal<br>
I6<br><br>
(AT) for use in a 3G wireless  system. The AT may support N carriers; however, it may selectively decline to support a maximum possible data rate on some or all of the supported carriers. For example, the AT may be configured to receive data transmitted on only some of the available H-ARQ interlaces. Such data rate constriction may be imposed on one, some, or all supported camera simultaneously. The data rate constriction will permit the AT to support N cariiers concurrently, thereby enabling multi-carrier support despite having limitations on certain resources needed for the data communication. An AT having such limited resources will in general by less complex and less expensive man an AT thai has sufficient resources for full-speed operation on all N supported cariiers concurrently. In particular, symbol memory requirements are reduced for such ATs.<br>

Each practical and novel combination of the elements described hereinabove, and each practical combination of equivalents to such elements, is contemplated as an embodiment of the invention.
