                         COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention, in general, relates to a field of fuel. More particularly, the invention provides a novel synthetic diesel fuel having branched esters as an alternative to diesel with improved fuel properties and the method of preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mineral diesel is the main source of energy used worldwide and the most explored as a transportation fuel, however, it possess several disadvantages like; the sources of crude petroleum are limited and burning of diesel in engines causes the environmental hazardous problems. Moreover, diesel is a non-renewable source of energy. Additionally, availability of crude petroleum is confined to some areas of the world. Consequently, oil dependency of any nation on other nation poses a great threat for the security of oil deficient nations. Therefore, in order to circumvent these problems and to reduce the dependence on the fossil fuel, scientists have been prompted to look into alternate synthetic diesel fuel.<br>
Last ten years have been focused on the benefits of producing cleaner, cost effective fuels process based on Fischer Tropsch technology that utilizes clean natural gas. Synthetic diesel finds applications in many diverse segments. The use of synthetic diesel in diesel engines results in substantial reduction of un-burnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matters and is considered as a 'clean fuel'.<br>
Unlike conventional diesel fuel which is produced as fractional distillate from petroleum, synthetic diesel is produced by Fischer-Tropsch process, wherein biomass, natural gas or coal is gasified to synthetic gas and subsequently liquified to produce synthetic diesel. Such processes are called Biomass-To-Liquids (BTL), Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) and Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) respectively. Such synthetic diesels are sometimes called FTD (Fischer-Tropsch diesel).<br>
Synthetic diesel fuels are attractive because they are designed to provide both good engine performance and emission reductions. Use of synthetic diesel results in significant reductions in emissions, including NOx and particulate matter. Synthetic diesel fuels are characterized by excellent properties, such as very high cetane number and nil sulfur content. They can be used in existing diesel engines without modifications or mixed with petro-diesel. Synthetic diesels are even potentially suitable for aviation fuels with higher flashpoints.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
While this specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming that, which is regarded as the invention, it is anticipated that the invention can be more readily understood through reading the following detailed description of the invention and study of the included examples.<br>
The subject invention is aimed to find a diesel fuel with improved properties which is achieved by producing branched esters as fuels. The synthetic diesel comprising esters<br>
8<br><br>
essentially has high cetane number, no suphur, no aromatics, no olefins, improved oxidative stability and excellent low temperature properties.<br>
In an effort to find new alternative diesel fuel, an improved process for the production of biodiesel was developed (US Pat Appl. No. US 2006/0094890), which is basically an alkyl ester of fatty acids having the carbon numbers mainly from C16-18. The use of biodiesel in conventional diesel engines results in substantial reduction of un-burnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matters. Biodiesel is considered as a clean fuel as it has almost no sulphur, no aromatics and has about 10% built-in oxygen, which helps it to burn fully. Its higher Cetane number improves the ignition quality even in blends with petroleum diesel. However, some problems were encountered using straight chain fatty acids esters (biodiesel) like the poor low temperature properties and the poor oxidative stability. In the process of commercialization of biodiesel, it is very desirable, to improve the cold temperature properties and oxidative stability, so as to use this in more adverse conditions. There are many possible structural variations, which can impact upon the performance of esters. According to the present invention, it is disclosed that the presence of a specific beta branching in the fatty esters side of the molecule results in improved properties. Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel synthetic diesel fuel, which is chemically branched ester, rich in oxygen content and with improved low temperature properties, higher cetane number and improved oxidation stability.<br>
The synthesis of synthetic diesel fuel can be achieved by any suitable process including chemical, biochemical, biological or biotechnological and is not restricted to a single process, wherein the prepared synthetic diesel is chemically branched ester, rich in oxygen content and with improved low temperature properties, higher cetane number and improved oxidation stability.<br>
The esters according to present invention can be used as neat or in the blends with mineral diesel from 1 to 99 % blends. This is fully mixable with diesel in any proportions. This branched fatty ester is prepared by the reaction of branched fatty acid with alcohol in the presence of acidic catalyst at the reflux temperature and is carried out at the temperature of 60-100°C.<br>
9<br><br>
Further, the esters according to the present invention for use as diesel fuel in compressed ignition engine is produced from a feedstock comprising of branched acids. Alternatively, it can be prepared starting from alcohols having carbon number from 3 to 16. These alcohols on dimererization using Guerbet reaction produce Guerbet alcohol (iso-alcohols), which on oxidation followed by esterification gave the desired esters. The following reaction scheme is further explained the steps involved in the process:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme-1: Reagents and conditions: i) ZnO, KOH, CaO, Cu bronze, 230°C, 10h, 80%; ii) Jones reagent, acetone, r.t, 6h, 70%; iii) Alcohol, acid, reflux, 20h, 75%.<br>
The alcohols employed in the preparation of synthetic diesel comprising branched esters include the primary, secondary or tertiary like methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol, butanol, iso-butanol and tertiary butanol.<br>
The acid catalyst employed in the preparation of synthetic diesel comprising branched esters includes sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, sulphated zircona, heterogeneous acid catalyst, zeolites and clay or their combinations. The quantities used of the catalyst are 0.1-5.0 % by weight of the branched acid. Preferred catalyst quantities are from about 1-3% by weight.<br>
Synthetic diesel comprising novel branched acids are specific beta-branched, i.e one hydrocarbon chain is connected to the beta position to the carboxylic group. Both of these<br>
10<br><br>
hydrocarbon branches could be similar in length or different. Preferably, the carbon numbers of one chain is two carbons higher than the other chain.<br>
The esterification reaction for preparation of novel esters for the synthesis of synthetic diesel can be carried out batch wise or continuously in any of the known reaction systems. In general, the alcohol is used in a 10% to 300 % excess over the stoichiometric quantity required for the esterification reactions. The esterification reaction is carried out with substantially anhydrous alcohols. Suitable catalysts for esterification include any acid catalyst particularly sulfuric acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid.<br>
The synthetic diesel fuel produced has s kinematic viscosity at 40° C as measured by ASTM D445 (may be) below about 5.0 cSt but not lower than 2.0 cSt as measured at 40 ° C. The kinematic viscosity plays a role in the diesel fuel pump ability as well as the fuel injectors ability to efficiently inject fuel. High viscosity fuels negatively influence the fuel atomisation process limiting the formation fine droplets that lead to poor air fuel mixing within the combustion chamber (cylinder) resulting in turn in incomplete combustion accompanied by loss of power and economy. Excessively low viscosities lead to fuel pump leakage, incorrect metering and the inability for the fine atomised spray to penetrate the length of the combustion chamber and will result in poor combustion and in turn, result in loss of power and economy. A viscosity between 2.0 and 6.0 cSt as tested by ASTM D445 at 40°C is preferred.<br>
The synthetic diesel of the present invention comprises of branched esters which has improved cloud point. The cloud point is the temperature at which a cloud of wax crystals first appears in a fuel sample that is cooled under conditions described by ASTM D2500. The pour point is the lowest temperature at which movement of the fuel sample can be determined when the sample container is tilted to 45° angle. The apparatus used is the same as for the cloud point. The sample must be cooled following the procedure described in ASTM D97. The cold filter plugging point is determined as defined by International Petroleum Standard IP-309 and ASTM D 6371-99. It determines the lowest temperature where 20 ml of fuel can be drawn through a 45-micron screen in 60 seconds with 200 mm of water (1.96 kPa) of vacuum.<br>
11<br><br>
The synthetic diesel of the present invention comprising branched esters has also improved oxidation stability and the same was carried out using Rancimat equipment model 743 as described by EN-14112. The oxidation was induced by passing a stream of purified air at the rate of 10 L/Hr. through the biodiesel sample (approx. 5 ml), kept at constant temperature. The vapors released during the oxidation process, together with the air, are passed into the flask containing 60 ml of water which has been demineralized or distilled and contains an electrode for measuring the conductivity. The electrode is connected to a measuring and recording device. It indicates the end of the induction period when the conductivity begins to increase rapidly. This accelerated increase is caused by the dissociation of volatile carboxylic acids produced during the oxidation process and absorbed in the water. When the conductivity of this measuring solution is recorded continuously, an oxidation curve is obtained whose point of inflection is known as the induction; which provides the characteristic value for the oxidation stability. The limit as per the specification in this method is 6 hours minimum.<br>
The synthetic fuel properties according to the present invention have shown better characteristics. The properties are evaluated in comparison with biodiesel and illustrated in Table I as following:<br>

Following examples further illustrate the present invention without limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The synthetic fuel was prepared by using a 1000 ml glass reactor, provided with thermostat,<br>
mechanical stirring, sampling outlet, and condensation system. Octanol-1 (300g) was charged to the reactor and ZnO (2g), KOH (6g), CaO (5g) and Cu Bronze (1.5g) were added. The above reaction mixture was heated at 200 °C for 8 hours to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered and purified by distillation to get 2-hexyl-l-decanol (250g). 2-Hexyl-1-decanol (250g) was reacted with Jones reagent (200ml) in acetone (200ml) to get 2-hexyl-1-decanoic acid. 2-Hexyl-l-decanoic acid produced (200 g) was again charged to the above reactor and subsequently, methanol (200 g) and sulfuric acid (6.0 g) were added slowly to the reactor with stirring. The reaction mixture was refluxed till completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was passed through basic alumina to get rid of residual catalyst. The catalyst free mixture was fractionated to separate un-reacted methanol and synthetic diesel. Prepared synthetic fuel was evaluated for fuel properties and results were tabulated.<br>
