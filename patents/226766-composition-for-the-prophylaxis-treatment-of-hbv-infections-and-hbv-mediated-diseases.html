				<td>The present invention relates to compositions that comprise at least two hepatitis<br>
B virus surface antigens (HBsAgs), fragments thereof and/or nucleic acids<br>
encoding them, the HBsAgs differing in hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype in the<br>
S region and/or pre-S1 region of HBsAg, the composition containing no HBV core<br>
antigen (HBcAg) or nucleic acid encoding that antigen; to pharmaceutical compo-<br>
sitions, especially vaccines comprising those compositions and their use in the<br>
prevention/treatment of an HBV infection or an HBV-mediated disease. The<br>
present invention relates also to a method of preparing a patient-specific medica-<br>
ment for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis; and to a kit for the diagnosis of<br>
HBV genotypes.<br>
More than 250 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis B virus<br>
(HBV). A significant number of those infected exhibit pathological consequences,<br>
including chronic hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma<br>
(HCC). The reason why certain people develop an acute HBV infection, while<br>
others do not, is little understood. Clinical data and analogy with other chronic<br>
viral infections have stressed the significance of a cell-mediated immune<br>
response in the control of viral infections, especially an immune response that<br>
includes cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The induction of a cytotoxic T-cell response is<br>
a critical factor in eliminating acute HBV infection and preventing chronic HBV<br>
infection. The viral genome encodes inter alia the envelope proteins pre-S1,<br>
pre-S2 and the S-antigen (HBsAg), the polymerase and the core protein<br>
(HBcAg).<br>
Chronic hepatitis B is progredient inflammation of the liver which can take a<br>
chronically persistent or chronically aggressive course. Chronically persistent<br>
hepatitis exhibits infiltration confined to the broadened portal areas of the liver<br>
with increasing fibrosation; clinically, signs of persistent hepatitis remain for years<br>
(up to 10 years), about 80% of the cases being HBsAg-positive. The pathogen-<br>
esis is probably based on insufficiency of the cellular immune system and<br>
persistent viral infection.<br>
The small hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a 226 amino acid protein<br>
(p24/gp27 or S-protein), is a prominent HBV antigen which is itself assembled in<br>
20-30 nm lipoprotein particles in which 100-150 subunits are crosslinked by<br>
muitiple inter- and intra-molecular disulfide bonds. The variability of the S-protein<br>
from HBV-isolates of different subtypes and genotypes is limited. The four stable,<br>
HBsAg subtypes adw, ayw, adr and ayr relate to single amino acid exchanges at<br>
positions 122 and 160 which are located adjacent to the immunodominant<br>
"a-determinant" (a hydrophilic region comprising residues 124-147). Those<br>
subtypes have not previously been assigned any biological or pathogenetic<br>
differences in HBV infection.<br>
A vaccine obtained from the plasma of chronic HBsAg carriers was approved for<br>
the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1982. Since that time, the<br>
vaccine has been produced by genetic techniques and used for the active<br>
immunisation of groups at risk. 95% of people who are seronegative prior to<br>
inoculation exhibit an immune reaction after one year. All hepatitis B vaccines<br>
used contain a high concentration of the purified HBsAg protein corresponding to<br>
the non-infectious sheath of the hepatitis B virus and are free of viral DNA or are<br>
formalin-deactivated.<br>
A disadvantage of the prior art is that at least 5% of people that are immunised<br>
are "non-responders" who do not exhibit an immune response. Furthermore,<br>
there has been no known vaccine hitherto for the treatment of chronically<br>
persistent hepatitis.<br>
WO 01/40279 and WO 01/38498 describe vaccines based on hepatitis B virus<br>
genotype G, but the two patent specifications make no mention of a combination<br>
of different genotypes.<br>
Michel et a/., PNAS 92 (1995), 5307-5311 and Mancini et al., PNAS 93 (1996),<br>
12496-12501 relate to DNA vaccines based on HBsAg. The documents make no<br>
mention of the use of compositions that contain combinations of HBsAg of<br>
different HBV genotypes.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the problem of providing improved<br>
means of preventing/treating an HBV infection or an HBV-mediated disease. The<br>
present invention is also based on the problem of providing a patient-specific<br>
medicament for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis. A further objective is to<br>
provide an improved kit for the diagnosis of HBV infections.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is solved by the provision of a<br>
composition comprising at least two hepatitis B virus surface antigens (HBsAgs),<br>
fragments thereof and/or nucleic acids encoding them, the HBsAgs differing in<br>
hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype in the S region and/or pre-S1 region of HBsAg,<br>
the composition containing no HBV core antigen (HBcAg) or nucleic acid<br>
encoding that antigen.<br>
The present invention is based on the following surprising observation: transgenic<br>
mice that express constitutively the HBsAg subtype ayw in the liver are regarded<br>
as being a preclinical model for assessing the efficiency of specific immuno-<br>
therapy protocols for chronic HBV infections. Such mice produce large amounts<br>
of HBsAg, which occurs as a result of persistent antigenaemia, and are substant-<br>
ially tolerant with respect to HBsAg. The inventors have now immunised HBsAg-<br>
transgenic mice on the one hand with a vaccine that corresponds in its HBsAg<br>
genotype exactly to the genotype of the transgenic mouse (ayw) and, on the<br>
other hand, with a vaccine that contains an HBsAg genotype different from that of<br>
the transgenic mouse. Despite repeated immunisation of the transgenic mouse<br>
with an HBsAg antigen that corresponds to its own HBsAg, no cytotoxic T-cell<br>
response was observed. In contrast, immunisation of transgenic mice with an<br>
HBsAg genotype different from their own genotype resulted in genotype-specific<br>
and cross-reactive cytotoxic T-cell responses to HBsAg. This shows that a<br>
naturally occurring variant of HBsAg can break "tolerance" by the priming of a<br>
cross-reactive T-cell immunity. Activation of the cytotoxic T-cell immunity results<br>
in a decrease in the HBsAg ayw-antigen and, furthermore, in liver-specific signs<br>
and symptoms which correspond to acute hepatitis with effective control of the<br>
HBV. The immune response observed is especially remarkable because the<br>
amino acid sequence of the HBsAg ayw-antigen differs from the amino sequence<br>
of the HBsAg adw2-antigen only at a small number of positions. It has been<br>
ascertained in the present invention that even a small number of conservative<br>
exchanges of amino acids in a T-cell epitope may result in a change in the T-cell<br>
reaction with respect to that epitope.<br>
The specificity and efficiency of the T-celi response to a protein antigen is<br>
regulated on various levels, especially decisive factors being: (i) the proteolytic<br>
release of the epitope (or antigenic peptide); (ii) the affinity of the antigenic<br>
peptide for the presenting glycoprotein of the major histocompatibility complex<br>
(MHC); and (iii) the negative interference of competitatively developing T-cell<br>
responses to different epitopes of the same antigen. Natural variants of a protein<br>
antigen can (by individual amino acid exchanges in critical sequences within the<br>
epitope or flanking the epitope, or by creation of new epitopes) induce a specific<br>
T-cell response in the following four ways:<br>
(i) more efficient proteolytic processing (release) of the antigenic peptide<br>
from the protein;<br>
(ii) high-affinity binding of the antigenic peptide to the presenting MHC<br>
molecule;<br>
(iii) elimination of immunodominant epitopes (which suppress responses<br>
to other epitopes of the same protein antigen) by an analogous<br>
progress, mentioned in (i) and/or (ii), which weakens the immuno-<br>
genicity of the epitope;<br>
(iv) new epitopes can be generated.<br>
In the context of the present invention it is demonstrated that natural variants of<br>
HBsAg, reflected by the genotypes, have a relatively broad spectrum of<br>
specificities in the T-cell response which they stimulate.<br>
in connection with the present invention, the term "HBV genotype" means the<br>
totality of the hepatitis B virus genome. The HBV genotype is preferably deter-<br>
mined by total sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. At the present time<br>
8 standard genotypes are known. Those 8 genotypes are based on a nucleotide<br>
variation of 8% with respect to one another; see Bartholomeusz, Rev. Med. Virol.<br>
In connection with the present invention, the expression "hepatitis B virus surface<br>
antigen' (HBsAg) denotes the small HBV surface antigen or S protein<br>
(p24/gp27). HBsAg can also include the pre-S1 protein domain. Preferably,<br>
HBsAg consists of the S protein and/or the pre-S1 protein domain.<br>
In respect of the numbering of HBsAg, the system in accordance with Kidd-<br>
Ljunggren et al., J. Gen. Virol. 83 (2002), 1267-1280, is used.<br>
The term "fragment" includes according to the invention fragments of HBsAg. The<br>
fragment preferably comprises at least 5 amino acids and contains a T-cell<br>
epitope, preferably at least 10, especially at least 20, more especially at least 50<br>
amino acids. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the composition<br>
comprises at least two HBsAgs or two fragments thereof. Such a composition is<br>
especially suitable for use as a polypeptide-based vaccine. Particularly in the<br>
case where the composition comprises two fragments that are derived from<br>
HBsAgs with a different HBV genotype, the first and the second fragments have<br>
at least 10 amino acids, preferably 20 amino acids, in common, but differ from<br>
one another by at least one amino acid.<br>
As mentioned above, the present invention is based on the recognition that even<br>
very small differences in an antigen (HBsAg) as a result of different genotypes<br>
lead to modified T-cell epitopes which differ only very slightly from one another<br>
but result in a dramatic change in T-cell reactivity. The two fragments which differ<br>
from one another by at least one amino acid can therefore readily be detected by<br>
simple sequence comparison of the known genotypes in respect of the HBsAg.<br>
Suitable fragments that differ from one another by at least one amino acid can be<br>
used in the composition according to invention. The fragments preferably contain<br>
at least one T-cell epitope, especially a human cell epitope. Methods of<br>
determining T-cell epitopes are known, for example Lauer et al., J. Virol. 76<br>
(2002), 6104-6113.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises at least<br>
two HBsAgs and/or at least two fragments thereof.<br>
Preference is also given to compositions that comprise at least a first HBsAg or a<br>
fragment thereof and a nucleic acid encoding a second HBsAg or a fragment<br>
thereof, the first and the second HBsAgs differing in HBV genotype.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment, the composition comprises at<br>
least two nucleic acids that encode two HBsAgs, the HBsAgs differing in HBV<br>
genotype. The nucleic acids can also be nucleic acids that encode a fragment as<br>
defined above. The nucleic acids may be viral DNA or synthetic DNA, synthetic<br>
DNA sequences being understood as including those which contain modified<br>
internucleoside bonds. The nucleic acids can also be RNA molecules, which may<br>
be necessary for expression by means of recombinant vector systems.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with the invention, mixed DNA/RNA molecules also<br>
come into consideration as nucleic acids.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the genotype is selected from the<br>
known genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. In respect of the respective refer-<br>
ence nucleic acid sequence, reference is made to the above definition section.<br>
The genotype is usually determined by means of an 8% nucleotide variation<br>
relative to the reference nucleic acid sequence, that is to say nucleic acids that<br>
are at least 92% identical to the reference nucleic acid sequence are also<br>
understood as a genotype in accordance with the definition. Identity of at least<br>
95%, especially 98%, relative to the reference nucleic acid sequence is especially<br>
preferred. "Identity" relative to the reference nucleic acid sequence is here deter-<br>
mined with the aid of known methods. Special computer programs having<br>
algorithms taking account of specific requirements are generally used.<br>
Preferred methods of determining identity generate in the first instance the<br>
greatest agreement between the sequences being compared. Computer prog-<br>
rams for determining identity include, but are not limited to, the GCG program<br>
package, including GAP (Deveroy, J. et al., Nucleic Acid Research 12 (1984),<br>
387; Genetics Computer Group University of Wisconsin, Medicine (Wl); and<br>
BLASTP, BLASTN and FASTA (Altschul, S., et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 (1990), 403-<br>
410. The BLASTX program can be obtained from National Center For<br>
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and from other sources (BLAST Handbook,<br>
Altschul S. et ai, NCBI NLM NIH Bethesda ND 22894; Altschul S. et ai; above).<br>
The known Smith-Waterman algorithm can likewise be used for determining<br>
identity.<br>
Preferred parameters for nucleic acid comparison include the following:<br>
Needleman and Wunsch algorithm, J. Mol. Biol. 48 (1970), 443-453<br>
Comparison matrix:<br>
Matches = +10<br>
Mismatches = 0<br>
Gap penalty: 50<br>
Gap length penalty: 3<br>
The GAP program is likewise suitable for use with the above parameters. The<br>
above parameters are the default parameters in nucleic acid sequence<br>
comparison. Further examples of algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap<br>
extension penalties and comparison matrices include those in the program<br>
handbook Wisconsin Package, Version 9, September 1997. The choice depends<br>
upon the comparison being carried out and also upon whether the comparison is<br>
being carried out between pairs of sequences, when GAP or Best Fit are used, or<br>
between a sequence and a large sequence data bank, when FASTA or BLAST<br>
are used.<br>
92% agreement in accordance with the above algorithm represents 92% identity<br>
in connection with the present invention. The same applies to higher identities.<br>
The composition according to the invention is preferably characterised in that the<br>
variant encodes a polymerase the activity of which corresponds substantially to<br>
the activity of the polymerase encoded by the reference nucleic acid sequence<br>
and/or the variant encodes an HBsAg the immunoreactivity of which corresponds<br>
substantially to the immunoreactivity of the HBsAg encoded by the reference<br>
nucleic acid.<br>
The polymerase activity can here be determined in accordance with Kim et al,<br>
Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47 (2), 301-308. The immunoreactivity of HBsAg<br>
can be: determined by commercially available antigen ELISAs. A "substantially by<br>
the immunoreactivity of the HBsAg encoded by the reference nucleic acid"<br>
means that an antibody binds to the reference HBsAg with substantially the same<br>
affinity as to the HBsAg encoded by the variant.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises at least<br>
three, preferably at least five, different HBsAgs, fragments thereof and/or nucleic<br>
acids encoding them.<br>
Especially preferably, the composition comprises HBsAgs of all known HBV<br>
genotypes, fragments thereof and/or nucleic acids encoding them.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the composition according<br>
to the invention, the nucleic acid encoding HBsAg or a fragment thereof is<br>
present in a vector under the control of a promoter suitable for expression of<br>
HBsAg in a mammal cell, preferably a human cell. If the composition comprises<br>
at least two nucleic acids encoding HBsAg or a fragment thereof, those acids can<br>
be present in the same vector (binary vector) or separately from one another on<br>
different vectors. Suitable vectors are, for example, plasmids, adenoviruses,<br>
vaccinia viruses, baculoviruses, measles viruses and retroviruses. The vector<br>
generally comprises a replication source which effects the replication of the<br>
vector in the transfected mammal cell.<br>
Suitable promoters can be both constitutive and inducible promoters. Preferred<br>
promoters are derived from CMV and SV-40.<br>
The compositions described above can be obtained by simply mixing the<br>
individual components and are therefore very simple to prepare. Suitable<br>
solvents and carriers depend upon the nature of the composition (polypeptide<br>
and/or nucleic acids). In principle, water-containing systems are preferred.<br>
HBsAg or fragments thereof are obtainable synthetically or by recombinant<br>
preparation. The polypeptides prepared can be purified by chromatographic<br>
nethods.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions can be obtained by co-expression of the at least<br>
two nucleic acids encoding HBsAg or fragments thereof in a recombinant<br>
expression system. The person skilled in the art will be familiar with numerous<br>
expression systems and methods; preferably yeast is used as host cell,<br>
especially preferably Hansenula polymorpha, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and<br>
Pichia pastoris are used. The nucleic acids can be present within a vector or in<br>
Two vectors that are separate from one another. Suitable vectors and promoters<br>
are as described above.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are prepared that comprise a composition according to the<br>
invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers are known to the person skilled in the art. Examples are: aluminium salts,<br>
calcium phosphate, lyophilisates of HBsAg with or without addition of<br>
polysaccharide, oil-in-water emulsions, poly-lactide-co-glycolate. Where such<br>
carriers do not themselves have an adjuvant action, they can be admixed with<br>
further adjuvants, such as, for example, lipid A mimetics, immunostimulatory<br>
nucleotides or bacterial toxins.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is especially a<br>
vaccine According to the invention, the pharmaceutical composition, especially<br>
the vaccine, is suitable for the therapeutic treatment of an HBV infection or an<br>
HBV-mediated disease. The pharmaceutical composition, especially the vaccine,<br>
is also suitable for the prophylactic treatment of an HBV infection or an HBV-<br>
mediated disease. The HBV infection is especially a chronically persistent<br>
hepatitis B infection. An HBV-mediated disease can be an acute chronic hepatitis<br>
B infection. Further HBV-mediated diseases are cirrhosis of the liver and primary<br>
liver cell carcinoma. The vaccine is suitable for administration to clinically<br>
inapparent HBV carriers, that is to say carriers who are not yet suffering from<br>
disease in the true sense, but have a high risk of developing an HBV-mediated<br>
disease in the future.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be administered intramuscularly, subcutan-<br>
eously, intradermally, intraveneously, mucosally or orally, but such administration<br>
is merely indicated as being preferred and there is no limitation thereto.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprises the at least two HBsAgs or fragments<br>
thereof in a dosage range of from 0.1 to 1000 µg/HBsAg or fragment thereof,<br>
preferably from 2.5 to 40 µg/HBsAg or fragment thereof.<br>
When the pharmaceutical composition comprises nucleic acids encoding HBsAg<br>
or fragments thereof, they are present in a dosage range of from 10 to<br>
1000 µg/nucleic acid encoding HBsAg or fragments thereof.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of preparing a<br>
medicament for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis B which comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
a) determination of the HBV genotype with which the patient is infected; and<br>
b) provision of a medicament comprising at least one HBsAg of an HBV geno-<br>
type, a fragment of the HBsAg or a nucleic acid encoding HBsAg or a frag-<br>
ment thereof, the HBV genotype differing from the HBV genotype of the<br>
patient determined according to a).<br>
As mentioned above, an important recognition of the present invention is that in a<br>
preclinical model of chronically persistent hepatitis a treatment effect has been<br>
obtained by treating the transgenic animal with an HBsAg originating from an<br>
HBV genotype that differs from the genotype of the transgenic animal.<br>
The genotype can be determined by the following methods: sequencing of the<br>
total HBV genome or at least the portion coding for the HBsAg and phylogenetic<br>
analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), multiplex-PCR.<br>
The provision of the medicament is carried out in a manner known per se by<br>
formulation of at least one HBsAg, a fragment thereof or a nucleic acid encoding<br>
HBsAg of a fragment thereof.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect, the present invention provides a kit for<br>
diagnosis of the genotype of an HBV infection. The kit comprises at least two<br>
HBsAg-specific binders, characterised in that the two HBsAg-specific binders are<br>
specific to different HBV genotypes. The at least two HBsAg-specific binders can<br>
be HBsAg genotype-specific primers and/or specific antibodies. The primers can<br>
have a length of 10-30 nucleotides and are complementary to the known HBsAg-<br>
sequences of the respective genotype. The antibodies are antibodies that can be<br>
obtained, for example, by immunisation of experimental animals, such as, for<br>
example, mice having the respective HBsAg corresponding to the desired HBsAg<br>
genotype, preparation of hybridomas in a manner known per se and screening for<br>
subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies.<br>

strated 12 days after immunisation. Isolated liver-mononuclear cells (MNC) and<br>
spleen cells were restimulated in vitro over a period of four hours (in the presence<br>
of Breieldin A) with the Kb/S208-215-binding peptide 1 (ILSPFLPL) or the Kb/S190-197-<br>

Figure 4: HBsAg-specific CD8 T-cell responses to the epitope 1 in HBs-tg mice.<br>
HBs-tg mice which express HBsAgayw in the liver were immunised intramuscularly<br>
three times (at four-week intervals) with DNA vaccines that encode HBsAg<br>
subtype ayw (pCI/Sayw) or adw2 (pCI/Sadw2) or with the negative control vector pCI<br>
(vector without insert). The spleen cells were removed from the immunised mice<br>
12 days after the last immunisation and were restimulated over a period of four<br>
hours in vitro (in the presence of Brefeldin A) with RBL5 cells, the RBL5 cells<br>
being restimulated with HBsAg particles of the ayw (RBL5/Spayw) or adw2<br>
(RBL5/Spadw2) subtype, or with the Kb/S208-215-binding peptide 1 of HBsAgayw<br>
(ILSPFLPL) or HBsAgadw2 (IVSPFIPL). The average number of spleen IFNy+<br>

RBL5/Sayw or RBL5/Sadw2 transfectants, or with the Kb/S190-197 epitope 2 of<br>
HBsAga/w (VWLSVIWM) or HBsAgadw2 (VWLSAIWM). The average numbers of<br>

Figure 6: S208-215-specific CD8+ T-cells were demonstrated in the liver of<br>
immunised HBs-tg mice. Transgenic HBs-tg mice were immunised three times (at<br>
4-week intervals) with a DNA vaccine encoding HBsAgadw2 (pCI/Sadw2). Liver and<br>
spleen cells were removed from immunised mice 12 days after the last injection<br>
and restimulated in vitro with the Kb/S208-215-binding peptide ILSPFLPL. The<br>
average number of spleen IFN?+ CD8+ T-cells/106 CD8+ T-cells ± standard<br>

Figure 7: Liver histopathology of HBs-tg mice that have been immunised with the<br>
pCI/Sadw2 DNA vaccine. Non-pathological liver histology was observed in B6 mice<br>
(A, B). HBs-tg mice (C, D) exhibited moderate cell enlargement and the cyto-<br>
plasm exhibits a ground glass appearance (D). The nuclei of the liver cells<br>
appeared moderately polymorphic. Periportal infiltrations are rare. Repeated<br>
immunisation with pCI/Sacw2 DNA induces severe histomorphological changes in<br>
the liver (E-l) which are consistent with acute viral hepatitis. Inflammatory<br>
infiltrations include Kupfer cells, lymphocytes and a small number of polymorpho-<br>
nuclear granulocytes which are located in the tabular parenchyma (F) and in the<br>
periportal areas (G). The hepatocytes appear hydropic and often have pyknotic<br>
nuclei, which is a sign of an early stage of apoptosis (F, arrows). Acidophilic<br>
bodies (H, arrows), that is to say apoptotic liver cells, are common and often<br>
surrounded by focal inflammatory infiltrations. Many liver cells exhibit marked<br>
vacuolisation (I, arrows). H &amp; E staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded<br>

were then restimulated over a period of four hours in vitro (in the presence of<br>
Brefeldin A) with RBL5 cells which had been pulsed beforehand with HBsAg-<br>
specific peptides. For that purpose, in each case the Kb/S208-215-binding peptide 1<br>
of HBsAgayw (ILSPFLPL) or HBsAgadw2 (IVSPFIPL) or the Kb/S190-197-binding<br>

The invention will be described in greater detail below with reference to<br>
Examples. The Examples are not intended to limit the invention, however.<br>
Examples:<br>
Material and methods<br>
General<br>
The HBV subtype adw2 under investigation corresponds to genotype A. The HBV<br>
subtype ayw corresponds to genotype D. The HBV subtype adr corresponds to<br>
genotype C.<br>
Mice<br>
C57BL/6JBom (B6) mice (H-2b) were kept under standard-pathogen-free<br>
conditions.<br>
C57BL/6J-TgN(Alb1HBV)44Bri transgenic (HBs-tg) mice, HBsAgayw (encoded by<br>
the HBV sequence having deposition number V01460 J02203) were obtained<br>
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, ME). Male and female mice 8-16<br>
weeks of age were used.<br>
Cells, recombinant HBsAg particles and antigenic HBsAg peptides<br>
The H-2b cell line RBL5 used is described in [10]. Stable RBL5 transfectants that<br>
expressed similar amounts of HBsAgayw and HBsAgadwa were prepared (data not<br>
shown). Recombinant HBsAg particles of subtypes ayw, adw2 and adr are<br>
obtainable from Rhein Biotech GmbH (Diisseldorf, Germany). The HBsAg<br>
particles prepared in the Hansenula polymorpha host strain RB10 were purified<br>
as described [3]. The synthetic Kb-binding S208-215 ILSPFLPL (ayw) or IVSPFIPL<br>
(subtype adw2) peptides and the Kb-binding S19O-197 VWLSVIWM (ayw) or<br>
VWLSAIWM (adw2) peptides were obtained from Jerini BioTools (Berlin,<br>
Germany). The peptides were dissolved in a DMSO solution in a concentration of<br>
10 mg/ml and were diluted with culture medium before use.<br>
Plasmids and DNA immunisation<br>
HBsAgayw, HBsAgadw2 and HBsAgadr were cloned into the pCI (Promega) and<br>
BMGneo vectors as described [4; 5]. As DNA vaccines, the plasmids pCI/Sayw,<br>
pCI/Sadw2, pCI/Sadr were used which expressed HBsAgayw, HBsAgadw2 and<br>
HBsAgadr equally well. This was shown by immunoprecipitation of HBsAg from<br>
cells that had been transiently transfected with the DNA of those plasmids (data<br>
not shown). Differences in the immunogenicity of the HBsAg epitopes therefore<br>
cannot be clarified on the basis of different amounts of HBsAg expression by the<br>
DNA vaccine or the transfectants. For intramuscular nucleic acid immunisation,<br>
50 µl of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1 µg/µl of plasmid DNA were<br>
injected into each tibialis anterior muscle as described [4]. Immunisation with<br>
mixtures of HBsAg subtypes was effected by injection of 50 µl of PBS containing<br>
in each case 1 µg/µl pCI/Sayw, 1 µg/µl pCI/Sadw2 and 1 ug/ul pCI/Sadr.<br>
Immunisation with HBsAg protein particles<br>
5 µg of HBsAg protein particles were injected subcutaneously together with 30 µg<br>
of CpG oligonucleotide (ODN1826, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) or<br>
8 µg of RC-529 (Corixa Corp. Seattle, WA, USA) in 100 µl of PBS (phosphate-<br>
buffered saline) per mouse. For immunisation with a mixture of HBsAg subtypes,<br>
in each case 5 µg of HBsAgayw, 5 µg of HBsAgadw2 and 5 µg of HBsAgadr protein<br>
particles together with 30 µg of CpG oligonucleotide adjuvant or 8 µg of RC-529<br>
in 100 µl of PBS were injected subcutaneously.<br>
Determination of specific spleen and liver CD8+ T-cell frequencies<br>
Spleen cell suspensions [1] and the preparation of hepatic NPC (non-<br>
parenchymal) cells has been described [6; 7]. The spleen cells and the liver NPC<br>
(1x106/ml) were incubated over a period of 1 hour in RPMI-1640 medium with<br>
5 µg/µl of HBsAg-derived peptides or HBsAg-expressing transfectants (106/ml) or<br>
HBsAg-particle-pulsed cells. 5 µg/µl of Brefeldin A (BFA) (catalogue No. 15870;<br>
Sigma) were then added and the cultures were incubated for a further 4 hours.<br>
The cells were harvested and their surface stained with anti-CD8 mAb, fixed and<br>
permeabilised and staining for cytoplasmic IFN? was carried out. The frequencies<br>
of CD8+ IFN?+ CTL were determined by FACS analysis. The average value for<br>
CD8- IFN?+ T-cells/105 spleen or liver T-cells is shown.<br>
Transfer of specific CD8+ T-cell lines<br>
CD8 T-cell lines were obtained from the spleen of B6 mice which were immun-<br>
ised with the pCI/Sayw DNA vaccine. The spleen cells were restimulated in vitro<br>
with syngenic RBL5 cells which were pulsed with the Kb/S208-215-binding peptide 1<br>
(ILSPFLPL) or the Kb/S190-197-binding peptide 2 (VWLSVIWM). In lines that were<br>
expanded in vitro over a period of about 2 weeks, more than 80% of the CD8+ T-<br>
cells had the expected epitope specificity, as is revealed by the specific IFN?-<br>
expression tests. The cells were washed, and 5 x 106 cells of those lines were<br>
injected intraveneously. Control cells were non-specific CD8+T blasts that were<br>
isolated from 3 days ConA-stimulated cultures.<br>
Determination of transaminases, HBsAg and anti-HBsAq antibodies in<br>
serum<br>
Serum antibodies were repeatedly obtained from individual, immunised or control<br>
mice by removal of blood from the tail vein at certain time points after injection.<br>
The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was carried out in the blood<br>
using the Reflotron® tests (catalogue No. 745138; Roche Diagnostics GmbH).<br>
The HBsAg concentation in the serum of the transgenic mice was determined by<br>
the commercial ELISA AUSZYME II (ABBOTT Laboratories, Wiesbaden,<br>
Germany) test. Antibodies to HBsAg were demonstrated in mouse sera using the<br>
commercial IMxAUSAB Tests (catalogue No. 7A39-20; Abbott, Wiesbaden,<br>
Germany).<br>
Antibody levels were qualified with the aid of 6 standard sera. The tested sera<br>
were diluted so that the measured OD values lay beween the standard serum<br>
one and six. The values shown herein were determined by multiplication of the<br>
serum dilution by the measured antibody level (mlU/ml). The serum titres given<br>
correspond to the mean of 4 individual mice + standard deviation.<br>
Histology<br>
Thin liver tissue sections (
period of 24 hours and embedded in paraffin. 2 µm thick paraffin sections were<br>
stained with haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E).<br>
Binding of HBsAg peptides to Kb<br>
Affinity-purified MHC class I molecules Kb were incubated over a period of<br>
48 hours at 18°C with increasing concentrations of test peptide and a defined<br>
concentration (about 2 nM) of radioactively labelled VSV NP 52-59 indicator<br>
peptide in the presence of 3 µM human ß2m as described [8, 9]. The binding of<br>
the peptides to MHC class I molecules was then determined by Sephadex G50<br>
column gel filtration [8]. The radioactively labelled VSV NP 52-59 peptide was<br>
located in the exclusion volume (MHC-bound peptide) and inclusion volume (free<br>
peptide). This was determined by gamma-radiospectrometry and the proportion<br>
of the test peptide that had bound to the MHC molecule relative to the total<br>
amount of test peptide was determined. The concentration of the test peptide<br>
required to obtain 50% inhibition of the binding of the indicator peptide (IC50<br>
value) was determined. The lower the IC50 value, the better the binding of the<br>
test peptide. In order to prevent depletion of ligand, in all binding experiments a<br>
MHC volume was used that was sufficient to obtain not more than 15-25%<br>
binding. Under those conditions, the IC50 value is an approximation to the<br>
(Fig. 3A). Although the frequency of HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cells within the liver<br>
CD8+ T-cell populations was high, their absolute numbers were smaller than in<br>
the spleen (data not shown). In contrast, no CD8+ T-cell reactivity was demon-<br>
strable in HBsAgayw tg B6 mice that had been immunised with the DNA vaccine<br>
encoding HBsAgayw (Fig. 3B). Neither three booster injections (at three-week<br>
intervals) with the DNA vaccine nor repeated immunisations with HBsAg antigen<br>
particles and oligonucleotide adjuvant brought about HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cell<br>
immunity in HBs-tg mice (data not shown). Accordingly, inoculation protocols<br>
using the same HBsAg variant to which the mouse is tolerant do not prime<br>
effective anti-viral CD8+ T-cell immunity.<br>
Example 3: Kb-restricted T-cell responses to the epitopes of HBsAgayw and<br>
HBsAGadw2 variants<br>
The HBsAgayw and HBsAgadW2 proteins from the HBV isolates, which proteins<br>
have 226 amino acid residues, differ in 16 amino acid residues (their amino acids<br>
accordingly being 93% identical). The sequence of the HBsAgayw protein that was<br>
used is identical to the sequence of the transgene-encoded HBsAgayw expressed<br>
by the HBs-tg B6 mice. The sequences of the Kb-binding epitopes 1 and 2 of<br>
HBsAgayw and HBsAgadw2 that were selected differ by, respectively, 1 and 2 amino<br>
acid residues within the epitope, but have identical flanking sequences (Fig. 1A,<br>
B). The S208-215-epitope 1 of HBsAgayw and HBsAgadw2 differ in two positions: in<br>
adw2, a valine (V) residue is replaced by a leucine (L) at position 2, and an<br>
isoleucine (I) is replaced by a leucine (L) residue at position 6 (Fig. 1B). The<br>
binding affinity of epitope 1 of Kb was rather low; the HBsAgadw2 variant of epitope<br>
1 exhibited higher binding affinity for Kb than the HBsAgayw variant of the epitope<br>
(Table 1). In contrast, the binding affinity of epitope 2 for Kb was high (Table 1).<br>
B6 mice immunised with the pCI/Sayw or pCI/Sadw2 DNA vaccine exhibited a CD8+<br>
T-cell response with respect to the Kb-binding epitope 1 that was observed after<br>
5 hours' ex vivo restimulation of primed spleen CD8+ T-cells which had been<br>
pulsed with either HBsAgayw or HBsAgadw2 particles or antigen peptide S208-215 of<br>
HBsAgayw or HBsAgadw2 (Fig. 4A), group 2,3). The ayw and adw2 variants of<br>
epitope 1 were cross-reactive, because (i) epitope-1-specific CTL were primed by<br>
pCI/Sayw or pCI/Sadw2; and (ii) cells that had been pulsed with HBsAgayw or<br>
HBsAgadw2 particles or had been pulsed with peptide ILSPFLPL (ayw) or peptide<br>
IVSPFIPL (adw2) present epitope 1 to primed CD8+ T-cells. Accordingly, the two<br>
substitutions within the 8-mer epitope 1 did not inhibit the effective processing,<br>
Kb-binding or presentation of the epitope.<br>
CD8+ T-cells that had been primed with the pCI/Sayw DNA vaccine recognised<br>
epitope 2 (S190-197) of HBsAgayw or HBsAgadw2 (Fig. 5A; group 2). This was<br>
demonstrated ex vivo after 5 hours' restimulation using peptide-pulsed cells or<br>
transfectants that expressed HBsAgayw. Primed CD8+ T-cells did not recognise<br>
transfectants that expressed the endogenous HBsAgadw2. Immunisation with the<br>
pCI/Sadw2 DNA vaccine did not prime epitope-2-specific T-cells (Fig. 5A, group 3).<br>
CD81 T-cells that had been primed with pCI/Sadw2 (but not with pCI/Sayw) DNA<br>
vaccine recognised a adw2-specific epitope of unknown epitope/restriction<br>
specificity which was presented by the transfectants; this was not investigated<br>
further (Fig. 5, group 3). Replacement of the amino acid at position 5 (exchange<br>
of the hydrophobic amino acid valine V for the hydrophobic amino acid alanine A)<br>
therefore inhibits the production of epitope 2, but not its presentation by the Kb<br>
molecule ([1].<br>
Example 4: Cross-reactive Kb-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses to HBsAg<br>
epitope 1 are primed in HBs-tg B6 mice<br>
HBs-tg B6 mice express HBsAgayw from a transgene in the liver. HBs-tg mice<br>
were immunised with HBsAgayw (pCI/Sayw) or HBsAgadw2 (pCI/Sadw2) (Fig- 4, 5B).<br>
No CD8+ T-cell response was obtained by repeated immunisation of HBs-tg B6<br>
mice with the pCI/Sayw DNA vaccine (Fig. 4, 5B, group 2). In contrast,<br>
immunisation of HBs-tg B6 mice with the pCI/Sadw2 DNA vaccine produced a<br>
CD8+ T-cell response to HBsAg (Fig. 4B, group 3). This cross-reactive CD8+ T-<br>
cell response recognised cells that had been pulsed with HBsAgayw or HBsAgadw2<br>
particles or with the ayw or adw2 variant of epitope 1 in peptide form (Fig. 4B,<br>
group 3). Those CD8+ T-cells did not recognise the RBL5/Sayw transfectants or<br>
the Kb-binding epitope 2 S190-197 (Fig. 5B, group 3). The CD8+ T-cells exhibited a<br>
subtype-specific reactivity towards an undetermined determinant which was<br>
presented by RBL5/Sadw2 but not by the RBL5/Sayw transfectants (Fig. 5B, group<br>
3). This shows that a natural variant of HBsAg is able to "break tolerance" by the<br>
priming of a cross-reactive T-cell immunity.<br>
An investigation was carried out into whether specific CD8+ T-cell populations<br>
can be demonstrated in the antigen-producing liver in the transgenic mice which<br>
were immunised with pCI/SadW2. In the spleen and in liver NMC from HBs-tg B6<br>
mice that had been immunised with pCI/Sadw2, specific CD8+ T-cell reactivity can<br>
be demonstrated over periods of months (Fig. 6). In contrast to the adoptively<br>
transferred CD8+ T-cells (Fig. 2), vaccine-primed anti-HBV-specific CD8+ T-cells<br>
therefore have access and exhibit stable absorption into the antigen-bearing<br>
target organ over a period of more than 3 months.<br>
Example 5: Histopathology of the liver of immunised HBs-tg mice that<br>
exhibit a specific CD8+ T-cell reactivity towards the HBsAg epitope 1<br>
HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cells induced an inflammatory response in the HBsAg-<br>
producing liver. Untreated B6 mice exhibited a normal liver histology (Fig. 7A, B).<br>
Hepatocytes from HBs-tg B6 mice were enlarged and exhibited a fine granular,<br>
pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, which is characteristic of "ground glass liver cells"<br>
which is also observed in the case of human HBV infection (Figure 7C, D). No<br>
inflammatory infiltrations were observed.<br>
HBs-tg mice that had been immunised with pCI/Sadw2 (but not with pCI/Sayw) DNA<br>
vaccine exhibited a severe liver histopathology (Fig. 7E). Inflammatory infiltrates<br>
that were found in the parenchymal (Fig. 7F) and periportal (Fig. 7G) areas<br>
consisted chiefly of mononuclear cells (Fig. 7F). Numerous small, lymphoid cells<br>
were distributed in the parenchymal and periportal areas. Localised groups of<br>
inflammatory cells surrounded the apoptotic hepatocytes (Fig. 7H). The enlarge-<br>
ment and hydropic swelling of hepatocytes was greater in immunised HBs-tg<br>
mice than in untreated HBs-tg mice. Some medium to small nuclei exhibited a<br>
condensed chromatin and a perinuclear halo (Fig. 7F arrows), which points to an<br>
early stage of apoptosis. Furthermore, numerous Councilman's bodies, repre-<br>
senting apoptotic liver cells, were observed (Fig. 7H, arrows). Some hepatocytes<br>
exhibited nuclear vacuolisation (Fig. 7, arrows). Significant cholestasis was not<br>
demonstrable.<br>
Example 6: Priming of HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cells in HBs-tq mice<br>
correlates with a reduction in antigenaemia<br>
Untreated HBs-tg mice exhibit HBsAg serum levels of 30-50 ng/ml (Fig. 8A). Mice<br>
that developed cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell responses to epitope 1 after HBsAgadw2<br>
immunisation exhibited reduced antigenaemia (with levels in the region of 5-<br>
15 ng/ml), whereas animals that had been immunised with HBsAgayw, which did<br>
not develop any HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity, exhibited no change in<br>
antigenaemia levels (Fig. 8A). The partial control of antigenaemia therefore<br>
correlates with the occurrence of specific CD8+ T-cells in the immunised trans-<br>
genic mice.<br>
Example 7: Anti-HBsAg serum antibodies occur in HBsayw-tg mice that have<br>
been immunised with HBsAgadw2<br>
In addition to T-cell immunity, the humoral anti-HBsAg immunity can play a role in<br>
the monitoring of antigenaemia. The occurrence of anti-HBsAg serum antibodies<br>
in vaccinated normal and transgenic mice was observed. Normal (non-trans-<br>
genic) B6 mice and congenic HBs-tg B6 mice were immunised twice with<br>
pCL/Sayw or pCL/Sadw2 DNA vaccine. Their serum antibody titres, which were<br>
specific to HBsAg, were determined two weeks after the last immunisation using<br>
the ImxAUSAB test (Abbott) which determines HBsAg of different subtypes.<br>
While non-transgenic mice that had been immunised with pCL/Sayw or pCUSadw2<br>
plasmid DNA developed high serum antibody levels to HBsAg, HBs-tg mice<br>
exhibited an anti-HBsAg serum antibody response only after immunisations with<br>
pCL/Sadw2 (but not with pCL/Sayw) plasmid DNA (Fig. 8B). Similar antibody<br>
responses were observed in mice immunised with HBsAgayw or HBsAgadw2<br>
particles (data not shown). A subtype-specific ELISA (with HBsAgayw or<br>
HBsAgadw2 particle-coated plates) showed that in normal mice &gt;95% of the<br>
antibody response produced by all vaccines is directed against the "a" deter-<br>
minant of HBsAg; in HBs-tg mice, &gt;90% of the antibody response is directed<br>
against adw2-specific determinants (data not shown).<br>
Example 8: Efficient priming of cross-reactive Kb-restricted CD8+ T-cell<br>
responses to HBsAq epitope 1 in HBs-tg B6 mice by immunisation with<br>
HBsAg protein particles<br>
Immunisation of normal B6 mice with HBsAg protein particles of subtype ayw or<br>
adw2 results in a CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune response to the Kb-binding<br>
epitope 1 (S208-215). Figure 9A). It can thus be shown that irrespective of the<br>
nature of the vaccines (protein particles or DNA), epitopes having different<br>
sequences are able to prime cross-reactive T-cell responses. Analogously to the<br>
immunisations with DNA vaccines (Figure 5), it has been found that vaccination<br>
of B6 mice with HBsAg protein particles of subtype ayw primes a CD8+ cell<br>
response to the HBsAg Kb-binding epitope 2 (S190-197) but not vaccination with<br>
HBsAg protein particles of subtype adw2 (Figure 9A).<br>
HBSayw-tg mice were immunised with HBsAg protein particle vaccines corres-<br>
ponding to either subtype ayw or subtype adw2. Whereas no CD8+ T-cell<br>
response was generated after repeated immunisation with the HBsAgayw protein<br>
vaccine, immunisation with the heterologous HBsAgadw protein antigen generated<br>
an HBsAg-specific CD8+ T-cell response to epitope 1 (Figure 9B). It is thus<br>
demonstrated that a natural variant of HBsAg is able to break an existing<br>
tolerance by the priming of a cross-reactive T-cell response also by means of a<br>
protein subunit vaccination.<br>
Example 9: Efficient priming of cross-reactive Kb-restricted CD8+ T-cell<br>
responses towards HBsAg epitope 1 in HBs-tg B6 mice by immunisation<br>
with mixtures of natural variants of HBsAg<br>
HBsayw-tg mice were immunised either with a DNA vaccine that coded for the<br>
three HBsAg subtypes ayw (pCI/Sayw), adw2 (pCI/Sadw2) and adr (pCI/Sadr)<br>
(Figure 10A), as well as a HBsAg protein particle vaccine containing a mixture of<br>
subtypes ayw, adw2 and adr (Figure 10 B). The mixture of natural variants of<br>
HBsAg primed cross-reactive Kb-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses to epitope 1<br>
both after immunisation with DNA and with protein particles.<br>
Example 10: Reduction of antigenaemia in HBs-tg mice after immunisation<br>
with mixtures of natural variants of HBsAg<br>
In untreated HBs-tg mice, a serum level of 30 - 50 ng/ml is observed. Animals<br>
which, after immunisation with a heterologous HBsAg vaccine (HBsAgagw2) or a<br>
mixture of natural HBsAg variants (HBsAgayw + HBsAgadw2 + HBsAgadr), develop a<br>
cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell response to epitope 1 exhibit reduced antigenaemia<br>
(with HBsAg levels of 5 - 17 ng/ml). In animals that were immunised solely with<br>
the homologous HBsAgayw and thus were unable to generate HBsAg-specific T-<br>
cell immunity, no change in the amount of antigen in the serum was observed.<br>
Immunisation with a mixture of natural variants of HBsAg can accordingly bring<br>
about a reduction in antigenaemia.<br>
Example 11: Induction of anti-HBsAg serum antibodies in HBs-tg mice after<br>
immunisation with mixtures of natural variants of HBsAg<br>
Normal B6 mice exhibit a marked antibody response after immunisation with<br>
HBsAgasw, HBsAgadw2, HBsAgadr(not shown) as well as with a mixture of the three<br>
subtypes.<br>
The formation of HBsAg-specific serum antibodies in HBs-tg mice after immun-<br>
isation was investigated. HBs-tg mice exhibited a serum antibody response only<br>
after immunisation with a mixture of natural HBsAg variants or with the hetero-<br>
logous subtype adw2. No anti-HBsAg response was induced after immunisation<br>
with the homologous subtype ayw. A subtype-specific ELISA (microtitre plates<br>
coated with HBsAgayw and HBsAgadw2 protein particles) showed that in HBs-tg<br>
mice &gt;90% of the HBsAg-specific antibody reponse is directed against adw2-<br>
specific determinants (data not shown).<br>
