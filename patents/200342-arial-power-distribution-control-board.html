The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD :<br>
This invention relates to an Arial power distribution control board<br>
BACKGROUND ART :<br>
For domestic, commercial and industrial electric supply, the lines are taken directly from arial fuse board installed on distribution pole which supports the live lines.<br>
As the board is installed in the open atmosphere the loose contact takes place in fuse terminals due to wind pressure, oxidation in fuse terminal and consumer service wires.<br>
The loose contact causes sparking in fuse terminals resulting in burning of cables and damaging of fuse device. This also results in fluctuation and interruption in supply.<br>
As the number of the fuse boards installed on the pole depends upon the number of connections released from the said pole. Sometimes the pole become crowded with the fuse boards that causes a lot of maintenance problems.<br>
The fuse link connected in fuse device mounted on Arial fuse board from which the consumer's supply is connected having a high current range than the sanctioned demand, because its current range is designed for fault current in circuit. The fault current is always 1.5 to 2 times more than the normal load current; hence the consumer can increase his load 1.5 to 2 times of his sanctioned load unauthorisedly. This discrepancy causes more losses to the distributing company because overloading by consumer circuit damages its meters and equipment's, results in incorrect recording of consumption and lowering of voltages in distribution systems.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main objective of this invention is to obviate the drawbacks in the existing low tension power distribution system.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to protect the consumer circuit and meter from short circuit and over current in his installation by using dual protection fixed range miniature circuit breakers.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to control consumer's load up to his sanctioned demand load by using miniature circuit breaker (MCB).<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to provide easy identification and systematic connections of the consumer cables in a small place.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to increase the life of the miniature circuit breakers by providing incoming and outgoing terminal blocks as reactance to avoid direct arcing in the MCB terminals due to loose contact.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is an Arial power distribution control board comprising a weatherproof metal box with a door attached to the said box by hinges and being provided with locking arrangements to shut or open it, number of cable glands being provided in one of the side walls of the said box, a bus cum terminal block being fixed on the back side wall of the said box and below this a DIN rail channel being welded for fixing the miniature circuit breakers having fixed ranges dual protections from short circuit/over current and below this out going terminal blocks being fixed, neutral links being provided near the cable glands and all the links being connected serially by highly conductive metal strips, the miniature circuit breakers being provided between the output side of the bus cum terminal block and input side of the outgoing terminal block, the arrangements being totally covered by a slotted tin cover and the miniature circuit breakers being projected out through the slotted portion of the said tin cover and grooves being provided over the slotted portion of the cover of inserting consumer number plates.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS :<br>
Fig.1: Shows the schematic view of the Arial power distribution control board.<br>
Fig.2: Shows the schematic view of the Arial power distribution control board with slotted tin cover.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
In fig.l Arial power distribution control board (1) comprises of a weatherproof metal box (2) with a door (3) having locking arrangements (4), the said door is attached to the said box by means of hinges (9). Four cable glands, one gland (5) for incoming cables from the main electric supply and three glands (6) for outgoing cables to the consumers are provided in one of the side walls of the box. However numbers of the glands for outgoing cables depend on the requirements of the consumers. The neutral links (8) are provided near cable glands for neutral line of supply and all are connected in series by means of high conductivity metal strip (10).<br>
In back side wall of the box, a bus cum terminal block (11) is fitted by means of nuts and bolts. Below this a DIN rail channel is welded for fixing miniature circuit breakers (12). Below this rail out going terminal blocks (13) are fitted with nuts and bolts. The miniature circuit breakers have soldered wires, which are to be connected to both incoming and outgoing sides.<br>
The phase cable wires coming from the main supply through the cable gland (5) are connected to the input side of the bus cum terminal block (11) and the neutral cable wire is connected to the neutral links (8). The out put side of the incoming terminal blocks (11) are connected with ends of incoming wires soldered to miniature circuit breakers (12). The out going ends of wires soldered to the out going side of MCB are connected to the in put side of the out going terminal blocks (13). The consumer supplies are provided from the output side of the outgoing terminal blocks (13) and the neutral link (8). In this arrangement the soldered wires of miniature circuit breaker connected to incoming and outgoing terminal blocks avoids loose contact in it and keeps away from heat effect directly due to loose contacts in incoming cables in MCB and outgoing cables to consumers.<br>
A slotted tin cover covers the above arrangements and through the slotted portion the MCBs are projected out. Above the slotted portion there are grooves for inserting consumer number plate, which helps to recognize consumer service wires easily.<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
This board is installed on the electric pole of distribution line and all connections to the consumer for low tension electricity either 3 phase or single phase are given through this board. The input 3 phase lines and neutral line are taken from the distribution line to bus cum terminal block through incoming cable gland. The other end of the bus cum incoming block is connected to circuit breakers as shown in fig. 1. The other end of the miniature circuit breakers are connected with the input side of the out going terminal blocks and finally connections are taken from the output side of the outgoing terminal blocks for the consumers.<br>
Also as said above the Arial power distribution control board can be installed near under ground power distribution pillar or near multi storage buildings where underground cables are provided for low tension supply and consumers cables are connected as above manner after having input phase and neutral from cable distribution pillar. When short circuit current occurs in consumer circuit due to wiring fault or over current flows in circuit due to unauthorised load extension by consumer, the dual protection fixed range miniature circuit breaker trips immediately and interrupts the particular consumer's supply to avoid further damages in consumer circuit and consumer meter as well as interruptions, low voltage problems in whole distribution systems.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will understand it that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adopt the particular situation without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated or carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all the embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
