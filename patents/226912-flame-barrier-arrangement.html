				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a flame barrier arrangement,<br>
having at least two flame barrier elements which are<br>
arranged one behind the other in the direction of flow<br>
of a combustible gas and have a multiplicity of gaps<br>
for extinguishing a flame impinging on the surface of a<br>
flame barrier element, and having at least one spacer<br>
element between flame barrier elements, in order to<br>
produce a space between adjacent flame barrier<br>
elements.<br>
Flame-arresting fittings having a flame barrier, which<br>
prevents the spread of flames from explosions,<br>
detonations or permanent fires and therefore prevents<br>
flames from breaking through, are used to protect<br>
against explosions, detonations and permanent fires. A<br>
wide range of different designs of flame barriers are<br>
known and can be categorized substantially as static<br>
dry flame barriers, static wet flame barriers and<br>
dynamic flame barriers.<br>
Most flame-arresting fittings which are currently in<br>
use are equipped with static dry flame barriers. These<br>
are elements in which use is made of the discovery that<br>
flames are no longer able to react within tight gaps,<br>
maintaining suitable limit dimensions, and therefore<br>
are made to go out. In this case, a flame is generally<br>
extinguished by intimate contact between the flame and<br>
cooling walls, e.g. by guiding the flame through narrow<br>
gaps .<br>
Flame barriers of this type can be designed as<br>
narrow-mesh screens, plate safety features, sintered<br>
metals, beds of beads and strip safety features. The<br>
essential factor is that the flame barrier gaps which<br>
are selected for safety can be reproducibly maintained<br>
within very tight tolerances. Therefore, nowadays, it<br>
is primarily strip safety features which are used,<br><br>
these features being produced by winding up in each<br>
case one smooth strip and one corrugated strip. The<br>
corrugated strip is provided with corrugations which<br>
are straight or directed to the left or right and<br>
define the gap width, which is in the range from 0.2 to<br>
at most 1.5 mm, depending on the explosive mixture.<br>
Depending on the type of flame-arresting fitting<br>
(explosion, detonation or permanent fire safety<br>
features), two, three or more strip securing discs are<br>
combined as flame barrier elements, optionally together<br>
with a surrounding cage in order to increase the<br>
mechanical strength, to form a complete flame barrier.<br>
A flame barrier of the generic type is disclosed, for<br>
example, in EP 0 375 455 A2, which shows a<br>
flame-arresting fitting with a flame barrier comprising<br>
four flame barrier elements which are arranged one<br>
behind the other in the direction of flow of a<br>
combustible gas. Narrow spaces which create an<br>
expansion zone for the gas in the gaps and lead to<br>
turbulent flow of the gas are provided between the<br>
individual flame barrier elements. The spaces are<br>
produced by spacer elements between the flame barrier<br>
elements.<br>
The conventional spacer elements are usually laid<br>
loosely between the flame barrier elements during<br>
assembly of a multilayer flame barrier. The spacer<br>
elements are in this case formed, for example, from a<br>
continuous triangular, polygonal or loop-like wire<br>
ring.<br>
Particularly in the case of flame barriers with<br>
relatively large diameters, the conventional spacers<br>
offer only insufficient mechanical strength. The<br>
relatively expensive flame barrier elements can easily<br>
be destroyed in the event of dismantling or cleaning.<br>
Under high loads, in particular in the event of<br><br>
unstable detonations, the flame barrier elements are<br>
deformed when using the conventional spacers, so that<br>
the space between adjacent flame filter elements is<br>
reduced.<br>
Therefore, it was an object of the invention to provide<br>
an improved flame barrier of the generic type.<br>
The object is achieved by the flame barrier having the<br>
features of the main claim as a result of the fact that<br>
one spacer element is securely joined, at least at<br>
certain points, to the surface of an associated flame<br>
barrier element.<br>
The secure join between a spacer element and flame<br>
barrier element significantly increases the mechanical<br>
strength of the flame barrier elements, so that even<br>
flame barrier elements of relatively large dimensions,<br>
e.g. up to 1600 mm, can be fitted and dismantled,<br>
transported and cleaned without mechanical damage.<br>
The connection of the spacers preferably takes place in<br>
a punctiform manner, e.g. using the spot-welding<br>
process, so that the surface area of the flame barrier<br>
element which is available for the passage of gas and<br>
liquid is not reduced unnecessarily.<br>
The spacer elements are preferably shaped in such a way<br>
that they form bearing points which are distributed<br>
over the entire surface of the corresponding strip<br>
safety element, so that the bending of the strip safety<br>
elements under a compressive load is prevented. By<br>
contrast, the conventional spacer elements only offer<br>
non-uniformly distributed bearing surfaces which,<br>
moreover, in some cases only offer bearing points in<br>
the outer peripheral region of the flame barrier<br>
elements.<br><br>
It is particularly advantageous if the bearing points<br>
of a spacer element are distributed uniformly over the<br>
surface of the corresponding flame barrier element. For<br>
this purpose, the spacer element may, for example, be<br>
in grid form.<br>
The spacer elements may be formed from wire grid, woven<br>
wire fabric and/or from round bars.<br>
The invention is described in more detail below with<br>
reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a complete<br>
flame barrier with three flame barrier<br>
elements arranged one behind the other in the<br>
direction of flow of a combustible gas, and<br>
spot-welded spacer element;<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view of a flame<br>
barrier element with spot-welded spacer<br>
element;<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of the flame barrier<br>
element from Figure 2;<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of a spacer element which<br>
is formed from a woven wire fabric;<br>
Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional view of the woven<br>
wire fabric spacer element from Figure 4;<br>
Figure 6 shows a cross-sectional view of a flame<br>
barrier element with spot-welded woven wire<br>
fabric spacer element;<br>
Figure 7 shows a plan view of the flame barrier<br>
element with spot-welded woven wire fabric<br>
spacer element from Figure 6;<br><br>
Figure 8 shows part of a plan view of a flame barrier<br>
element in the embodiment of a strip safety<br>
element;<br>
Figure 9 shows a cross-sectional view of a<br>
conventional flame barrier with three flame<br>
barrier elements arranged one behind the<br>
other in the direction of flow of a<br>
combustible gas and non-uniformly laid out<br>
spacer elements at the outer and inner<br>
peripheries of the flame filter elements;<br>
Figure 10 shows a plan view and cross-sectional view of<br>
a triangular spacer element;<br>
Figure 11 shows a plan view and a cross-sectional view<br>
of a spacer element in loop form;<br>
Figure 12 shows a cross-sectional view of a flame<br>
barrier with three flame barrier elements<br>
which are arranged one behind the other in<br>
the direction of flow of a combustible gas<br>
and are deformed by compressive load.<br>
Figure 1 shows a flame barrier 1 with three flame<br>
barrier elements 2a, 2b, 2c which are arranged one<br>
behind the other in the direction of flow of a<br>
combustible gas and are fitted into a surrounding cage<br>
3. The surrounding cage 3 is in two parts, so that the<br>
flame barrier elements 2a, 2b, 2c can be readily fitted<br>
and subsequently dismantled for replacement and<br>
cleaning. The two parts of the surrounding cage 3 are<br>
held together by a screw connection 4.<br>
It can be seen that a space is ensured between in each<br>
case two adjacent flame barrier elements 2a, 2b and<br>
2b, 2c with the aid of spacer elements 5.<br>
If a flame impinges on the generally circular surface<br>
of the flame barrier, the flame is cooled, with the aid<br><br>
of a multiplicity of gaps in the flame barrier elements<br>
2a, 2b and 2c, to such an extent that it goes out.<br>
Moreover, the spacers ensure a turbulent flow, which<br>
promotes cooling and extinguishing of the flame.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view of a flame<br>
barrier component with a flame barrier element 2, on<br>
the surface of which a spacer element is arranged.<br>
According to the invention, the spacer element 5 is<br>
securely joined to the surface of the flame barrier<br>
element 2, preferably by spot-welded joints 6. In this<br>
way, the flame barrier component is stabilized, and<br>
mechanical damage during dismantling or cleaning, and<br>
also deformation of the flame barrier component in the<br>
event of a detonation wave impinging on it, is<br>
prevented.<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of the flame barrier<br>
component from Figure 2. It can be seen from this<br>
figure that the spacer element 2 comprises a<br>
multiplicity of parallel rods, which are arranged at a<br>
distance from one another and, uniformly distributed<br>
over the entire surface of the flame barrier element 2,<br>
form bearing points for an adjacent flame barrier<br>
component. This effectively prevents the flame barrier<br>
element 2 from bending under a compressive load, in<br>
particular in the event of a detonation wave impinging<br>
on it.<br>
Figure 4 shows an advantageous embodiment of a spacer<br>
element 2 which is formed from a woven wire fabric. At<br>
the intersection points of the woven wire fabric, the<br>
spacer element 5 is spot-welded to the associated flame<br>
barrier element 2, as can be seen from the<br>
cross-sectional views shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 7 shows a plan view of a flame barrier element 2<br>
together with the spacer element, which is in the form<br>
of a wire grid, which spacer element, uniformly at<br><br>
every other intersection point, has a spot-welded joint<br>
6 with the flame barrier element 2.<br>
Figure 8 shows a flame barrier element 2 in the<br>
embodiment of a strip safety element, as a plan view of<br>
part of such an element. The strip safety element is<br>
formed from a smooth strip 7 and a corrugated strip 8<br>
above it, which are wound together helically. The<br>
smooth strip 7 and the corrugated strip 8 are usually<br>
about 10 mm wide.<br>
The corrugation in the corrugated strip 8 defines the<br>
gaps. Depending on the medium for which the strip<br>
safety element is designed, the gap width SW is in the<br>
range from less than 0.2 mm to at most 1.5 mm.<br>
Figure 9 shows a conventional flame barrier 1 with<br>
three flame barrier elements 2a, 2b and 2c which are<br>
arranged one behind the other in the direction of flow<br>
of a combustible gas and are fitted in a surrounding<br>
cage 3. Unlike the flame barrier 1 according to the<br>
invention, the spacer elements 5 are fitted loosely<br>
between the flame barrier elements 2a, 2b, 2c and only<br>
lie non-uniformly on the surface of the corresponding<br>
flame barrier element 2a, 2b or 2c.<br>
Figure 10 shows an embodiment of a conventional<br>
triangular spacer element 9, which is inserted loosely<br>
between the flame barrier element 2. It can be seen<br>
from the cross-sectional illustration that the spacer<br>
element 9 is formed from a round wire.<br>
Figure 11 shows another embodiment of conventional<br>
spacer element 10 in loop form, which is likewise<br>
inserted loosely between the flame barrier elements 2<br>
and lies non-uniformly over the surface of the<br>
corresponding flame barrier element 2. The cross-<br>
sectional illustration reveals that the spacer element<br>
10 is likewise formed from a round wire, and the<br><br>
bearing surface, in cross section, is distributed non-<br>
uniformly over the surface of the corresponding flame<br>
barrier element 2.<br>
As can be seen from the cross-sectional illustration of<br>
a flame barrier 1 under compressive load, for example<br>
in the event of a detonation, the flame barrier<br>
elements 2a and 2b are deformed under compressive load,<br>
so that the spaces between the flame barrier elements<br>
2a, 2b and 2c are bridged. This may result in a flame<br>
breaking through. Unlike the flame barrier 1<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, with a spacer element 5<br>
positioned uniformly over the entire surface of the<br>
corresponding flame barrier element 2, the flame<br>
barrier elements 2a and 2b can bend, since the<br>
conventional spacer elements 9, 10 form a support for<br>
the corresponding flame barrier element 2a, 2b and 2c<br>
only over part of the surface. When using the<br>
connection provided by the triangular spacer element 9<br>
shown in Figure 10, the bearing points,<br>
disadvantageously, are even located only in the outer<br>
peripheral region of the flame barrier element 2.<br>
The use of the spacer element 5 according to the<br>
invention, which rests uniformly over the entire<br>
surface of the corresponding flame barrier element 2,<br>
increases the stability of the flame barrier component<br>
and ensures a constant space between the adjacent flame<br>
barrier components even under a compressive load.<br><br>
