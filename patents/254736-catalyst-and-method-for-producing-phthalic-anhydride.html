				<td>CATALYST AND METHOD FOR PREPARING PHTHALIC<br>
ANHYDRIDE<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst, in particular for the<br>
preparation of phthalic anhydride (PA) by gas phase oxidation<br>
of o-xylene and/or naphthalene, the catalytically active<br>
composition of the catalyst comprising titanium dioxide<br>
having particular properties.<br>
The industrial-scale preparation of phthalic anhydride is<br>
achieved by the catalytic gas phase oxidation of o-xylene and/or<br>
naphthalene. For this purpose, a catalyst suitable for the<br>
reaction is charged into a reactor, preferably what is known as<br>
a tube bundle reactor in which a multitude of tubes are arranged<br>
in parallel, and flowed through from the top or bottom with a<br>
mixture of the hydrocarbon(s) and an oxygenous gas, for example<br>
air. Owing to the intense heat formation of such oxidation<br>
reactions, it is necessary for a heat carrier medium to flow<br>
around the reaction tubes to prevent what are known as hotspots,<br>
and thus to remove the amount of heat formed. This energy can be<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
utilized for the production of steam. The heat carrier medium<br>
used is generally a salt melt and here preferably a eutectic<br>
mixture of NaNO2 and KNO3.<br>
To suppress the unwanted hotspots, it is likewise possible to<br>
charge a structured catalyst into the reaction tube, which<br>
can give rise, for example, to two or three catalyst zones<br>
composed of catalysts of different composition. Such systems<br>
are already known as such from EP 1 082 317 B1 or EP 1 084<br>
115 B1.<br>
The layer-by-layer arrangement of the catalysts also has the<br>
purpose of keeping the content of undesired by-products, i.e.<br>
compounds which are before the actual product of value in a<br>
possible reaction mechanism from o-xylene and/or naphthalene<br>
to phthalic anhydride, in the crude PA as low as possible.<br>
These undesired by-products include mainly the compounds<br>
o-tolylaldehyde and phthalide. The further oxidation of these<br>
compounds to phthalic anhydride additionally increases the<br>
selectivity with regard to the actual product of value.<br>
In addition to the above-addressed under-oxidation products,<br>
over-oxidation products also occur in the reaction. These<br>
include maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, benzoic acid<br>
and the carbon oxides. Selective suppression of the formation<br>
of these undesired by-products in favour of the product of<br>
value leads to a further rise in the productivity and<br>
economic viability of the catalyst.<br>
There is constant need for catalysts which enable an increase<br>
in productivity and economic viability.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to develop<br>
a catalyst or a catalyst system which avoids the<br>
disadvantages of known catalysts from the prior art and<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
enables an improvement in the activity, selectivity and/or<br>
lifetime of the catalyst.<br>
A first aspect of the invention therefore relates to a<br>
catalyst, in particular for the preparation of phthalic<br>
anhydride by gas phase oxidation of o-xylene and/or naphthalene,<br>
having an inert support and at least one layer which has been<br>
applied thereto and has a catalytically active composition<br>
comprising TiO2, characterized in that at least a portion of the<br>
TiO2 used has the following properties: (a) the BET surface area<br>
is more than 15 m2/g, (b) the primary crystal size is preferably<br>
more than 210 ångstrøm. Preferred embodiments are specified in<br>
the subclaims.<br>
It is assumed, without any restriction of the invention to<br>
the correctness of this theoretical assumption, that the use<br>
of the titanium dioxide having the properties described here<br>
in a catalyst can result in particularly advantageous<br>
reaction spaces being achieved for the desired reactions, in<br>
particular within the pore structure. At the same time, when<br>
the inventive Ti02 matrix is used, advantageous access routes<br>
for the reactants to the reactive sites on the surface of the<br>
Ti02 matrix, and also escape routes for the reaction products,<br>
are provided.<br>
An essential feature of the present invention is the use of a<br>
specific titanium dioxide which is notable for a<br>
comparatively high BET surface area of more than 15 m2/g, in<br>
particular between about 15 and 60 m /g.<br>
In a further preferred aspect of the present invention, Ti02<br>
is used which has a primary crystal size (primary particle<br>
size) of more than about 210 ångstrøm, preferably more than<br>
about 250 ångstrøm, more preferably more than about<br>
300 ångstrøm, further preferred at least 320 ångstrøm, in<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
particular at least about 340 ångstrøm, further preferred at<br>
least about 380 ångstrøm. Thus, it has been found that those<br>
TiO2 primary crystals having the aforementioned (minimum) size<br>
enable the preparation of particularly advantageous<br>
catalysts. The primary crystal size is preferably below<br>
900 ångstrøm, in particular below 600 ångstrøm, further<br>
preferred below 500 ångstrøm. The aforementioned crystal size<br>
apparently enables, without a restriction of the invention to<br>
this assumption, the formation of a not excessively compact,<br>
but rather open-pored structure of the titanium dioxide in<br>
the catalyst. One process for determining the primary crystal<br>
size is specified in the method section which follows. In a<br>
further aspect of the invention, it has also been found that<br>
the compliance with the aforementioned primary crystal size<br>
is specified in the method section which follows, in a<br>
further aspect of the invention, it has also been found that<br>
the compliance with the aforementioned primary crystal size<br>
in at least a portion of the titanium dioxide used for the<br>
catalyst preparation in itself (i.e. without compliance with<br>
the aforementioned pore radius distribution) already provides<br>
surprisingly good results, even though the simultaneous<br>
compliance with the above-defined pore radius distribution is<br>
preferred in accordance with the invention.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention, it has been<br>
found that, surprisingly, when titanium dioxide in which at<br>
least 25%, in particular at least about 40%, more preferably<br>
at least about 50%, most preferably at least about 60%, of<br>
the total pore volume is formed by pores having a radius<br>
between 60 and 400 nm is used, particularly advantageous<br>
catalysts can be obtained.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, TiO2 is used<br>
which has a bulk density of less than 1.0 g/ml, in particular<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
less than 0.8 g/ml, more preferably less than about 0.6 g/ml.<br>
Most preferred are TiO2 materials having a bulk density of not<br>
more than about 0.55 g/ml. One process for determining the<br>
bulk density is specified in the method section which<br>
follows. It has thus been found that the use of titanium<br>
dioxide having a bulk density as defined above enables the<br>
preparation of particularly high-performance catalysts. It is<br>
assumed, without a restriction of the invention thereto, that<br>
the bulk density here is a measure of a particularly<br>
favourable structure of the TiO2 surface made available in the<br>
catalyst, and the loose, not excessively compact structure<br>
provides particularly favourable reaction spaces and access<br>
and escape routes for the reactants and reaction products<br>
respectively. In a particularly preferred inventive<br>
embodiment, the titanium dioxide used will thus, in addition<br>
to the pore radius distribution and primary crystal size<br>
described herein, also have the bulk density defined herein.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, it has, however, also<br>
been found that a material which, irrespective of the pore<br>
radius distribution described herein and the primary crystal<br>
size, complies with the above-defined bulk density<br>
unexpectedly already has better results than comparative<br>
materials having a higher bulk density.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the present invention, the primary<br>
crystals of the titanium dioxide used are at least partly<br>
combined to form agglomerates which can be recognized<br>
readily, for example, in electron micrographs. When they are<br>
open-pored, in particular "sponge-like", agglomerates, the<br>
preferred, not excessively compact, porous structure of the<br>
titanium dioxide is favoured. In a preferred inventive<br>
embodiment, the primary crystals of the TiO2 are combined to<br>
an extent of more than 30%, in particular more than 50%, to<br>
form agglomerates, in particular open-pored agglomerates.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Preferably, the TiO2 used (anatase modification) (in all<br>
layers of the catalyst) has an alkali content, especially of<br>
Na, of less than 0.3% by weight, in particular less than 0.2%<br>
by weight, preferably less than 0.15% by weight, further<br>
preferred less than 0.02% by weight, further preferred less<br>
than 0.015% by weight. Preferably, the above threshold values<br>
apply for both Na and K. In a further preferred aspect of the<br>
invention, the fraction of alkali impurities (total alkali<br>
content) of the TiO2 used, determined as sum of impurities of<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium, is less than<br>
1.000 ppm, in particular less than 500 ppm, especially<br>
preferred less than 300 ppm. A method for determination of<br>
the fraction of alkali impurities is given below, prior to<br>
the examples (DIN ISO 9964-3). The aforementioned total<br>
alkali content of the TiO2 enables an exact adjustment of the<br>
alkali promoter content of the catalyst.<br>
The fraction of alkali impurities may, as known to the<br>
expert, optionally be lowered by washing, e.g. with diluted<br>
nitric acid at raised temperature, in order to achieve the<br>
preferred range of less than 1.000 ppm. For example, the TiO2<br>
may be suspended in 0.1 M HNO3 and washed over night with<br>
agitation under reflux, subsequently filtered and washed<br>
three times with bidestilled water and dried at 150°C in air.<br>
Subsequently, the content of alkali impurities is again<br>
determined, and, if too high, the aforementioned procedure is<br>
repeated.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the TiO2-containing catalyst is used for the gas<br>
phase oxidation of hydrocarbons. Especially preferred is use<br>
for preparing phthalic anhydride by gas phase oxidation of<br>
o-xylene, naphthalene or mixtures thereof. However, a<br>
multitude of other catalytic gas phase oxidations of aromatic<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylenes, naphthalene, toluene<br>
or durene for the preparation of carboxylic acids and/or<br>
carboxylic anhydrides are also known in the prior art. These<br>
afford, for example, benzoic acid, maleic anhydride, phthalic<br>
anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or<br>
pyromellitic anhydride. It is also possible in such reactions<br>
to use the inventive catalyst.<br>
In general, in the reaction, a mixture of a molecular oxygen-<br>
containing gas, for example air, and the starting material to<br>
be oxidized is passed through a fixed bed reactor, in<br>
particular a tube bundle reactor, which can consist of a<br>
multitude of tubes arranged in parallel. In the reactor tubes<br>
is disposed in each case a bed composed of at least one<br>
catalyst. The preferences for a bed composed of a plurality<br>
of (different) catalyst zones have already been addressed<br>
above.<br>
When the inventive catalysts are used for the preparation of<br>
phthalic anhydride by gas phase oxidation of o-xylene and/or<br>
naphthalene, it has been found that, surprisingly, the<br>
inventive catalysts afford a high activity with<br>
simultaneously low formation of the undesired by-products COX,<br>
i.e. CO2 and CO. In addition, a very good C8 and PA<br>
selectivity is found, as the result of which the productivity<br>
of the catalyst is increased. In many cases, the high C8<br>
selectivity and the low COX selectivity of the inventive<br>
catalysts in particular will also be of interest. The low COX<br>
selectivity also results in an advantageous manner in lower<br>
heat evolution and also lower hotspot temperatures. This<br>
results in there being slower deactivation of the catalyst in<br>
the hotspot region.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
In a preferred inventive embodiment, the TiO2 used has a BET<br>
surface area (DIN 66131) between about 15 and 45 m2/g, in<br>
particular between about 15 and 30 m2/g.<br>
It is further preferred that up to 80%, in particular up to<br>
75%, more preferably up to 70%, of the total pore volume is<br>
formed by pores having a radius between 60 and 400 nm.<br>
The pore volumes and fractions specified herein are<br>
determined, unless stated otherwise, by means of mercury<br>
porosimetry (to DIN 66133). The total pore volume stated<br>
relates in the present description in each case to the total<br>
pore volume, measured by means of mercury porosimetry,<br>
between 7500 and 3.7 nm pore radius size.<br>
Pores having a radius of more than 400 nm constitute<br>
preferably fewer than about 30%, in particular fewer than<br>
about 22%, more preferably fewer than 20%, of the total pore<br>
volume of the Ti02 used.<br>
It is further preferred that about 50 to 75%, in particular<br>
about 50 to 70%, more preferably about 50 to 65%, of the<br>
total pore volume of the T1O2 is formed by pores having a<br>
radius of 60 to 400 nm, and preferably about 15 to 25% of the<br>
total pore volume is formed by pores having a radius of more<br>
than 400 nm.<br>
With regard to the smaller pore radii, it is preferred that<br>
less than 30%, in particular less than 20%, of the total pore<br>
volume of the titanium dioxide is formed by pores having a<br>
radius of 3.7 to 60 nm. For this pore size, a range which is<br>
particularly preferred here is about 10 to 30% of the total<br>
pore volume, in particular 12 to 20%.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the TiO2 used has the<br>
following particle size distribution: the D10 value is<br>
preferably 0.5 urn or lower; the D50 value (i.e. the value at<br>
which in each case half of the particles have a greater and<br>
smaller particle diameter) is preferably 1.5 μm or below; the<br>
D90 value is preferably 4 urn or below. The D90 value of the<br>
TiO2 used is preferably between about 0.5 and 20 μm, in<br>
particular between about 1 and 10 urn, more preferably between<br>
about 2 and 5 μm. The titanium dioxide is preferably in the<br>
anatase form.<br>
TiO2 materials which are useful according to the invention are<br>
commercially available, e.g. under the tradename NT22-B20 and<br>
NT22-B30 by Nano Inc., Ltd., 1108-1 Bongkok Sabong, Jinju,<br>
Kyoungnam 660-882, Korea).<br>
The skilled person also is aware that the primary crystal<br>
size of TiO2 may be enlarged by heating or calcining. For<br>
example, calcination in a rotary furnace at about 600°C for<br>
24 to 48h in a mixture of 50% water vapour and 50% air may be<br>
carried out to enlarge the primary crystal size. If the<br>
primary crystal size according to the invention has not been<br>
reached, the procedure may be repeated. As, in parallel, the<br>
BET surface may drop, a Ti02 material with relatively high BET<br>
surface should be used as starting material, so that finally<br>
a BET surface of more than 15 m2/g is provided.<br>
Depending on the intended use of the inventive catalyst, the<br>
components which are familiar and customary to those skilled<br>
in the art may be present in addition to the Ti02 used in<br>
accordance with the invention in the active composition of<br>
the catalyst. In one possible inventive embodiment, it is<br>
also possible for only a portion of the titanium dioxide used<br>
for the catalyst preparation to have the properties described<br>
herein, although this is generally not preferred. The shape<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
of the catalyst and its homogeneous or heterogeneous<br>
structure is also in principle not restricted in the context<br>
of the present invention and may include any embodiment which<br>
is familiar to those skilled in the art and appears to be<br>
suitable for the particular field of application.<br>
When the inventive catalyst is used, in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, for the preparation of phthalic<br>
anhydride, useful catalysts have been found to be what are<br>
known as coated catalysts. In these catalysts, a support<br>
which is inert under the reaction conditions, for example<br>
composed of quartz (SiO2) , porcelain, magnesium oxide, tin<br>
dioxide, silicon carbide, rutile, clay earth (Al2O3),<br>
aluminium silicate, magnesium silicate (steatite), zirconium<br>
silicate or cerium silicate, or composed of mixtures of the<br>
aforementioned materials, is used. The support may, for<br>
example, have the shape of rings, spheres, shells or hollow<br>
cylinders. To this is applied, in comparatively thin layers<br>
(shells), the catalytically active composition. It is also<br>
possible to apply two or more layers of the catalytically<br>
active composition having the same or different compositions.<br>
With regard to the further components of the catalytically<br>
active composition of the inventive catalyst (in addition to<br>
Ti02) , it is possible in principle to make reference to the<br>
compositions and components which have been described in the<br>
relevant prior art and are familiar to those skilled in the<br>
art. These are mainly catalyst systems which, in addition to<br>
titanium oxide(s), comprise oxides of vanadium. Such<br>
catalysts are described, for example, in EP 0 964 744 B1,<br>
whose disclosure on this subject is incorporated explicitly<br>
by reference into the description.<br>
In particular, the prior art describes a series of promoters<br>
for increasing the productivity of the catalysts, which may<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
likewise be used in the inventive catalyst. These include the<br>
alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, thallium, antimony,<br>
phosphorus, iron, niobium, cobalt, molybdenum, silver,<br>
tungsten, tin, lead and/or bismuth, and mixtures of two or<br>
more of the aforementioned components. For example, DE 21 59<br>
441 A describes a catalyst which, in addition to titanium<br>
dioxide of the anatase modification, consists of 1 to 30% by<br>
weight of vanadium pentoxide and zirconium dioxide. It is<br>
possible via the individual promoters to influence the<br>
activity and selectivity of the catalysts, in particular by<br>
lowering or increasing the activity. The selectivity-<br>
increasing promoters include, for example, the alkali metal<br>
oxides, whereas oxidic phosphorus compounds, in particular<br>
phosphorus pentoxide, increase the activity of the catalyst<br>
at the cost of the selectivity.<br>
For the preparation of the inventive catalysts, the prior art<br>
describes numerous suitable processes, so that a detailed<br>
illustration is in principle not required here. For the<br>
preparation of coated catalysts, reference can be made, for<br>
example, to the process described in DE-A-16 42 938 or DE-A<br>
17 69 998, in which a solution or suspension, comprising an<br>
aqueous and/or an organic solvent, of the components of the<br>
catalytically active composition and/or precursor compounds<br>
thereof (frequently referred to as "slurry") is sprayed onto<br>
the support material in a heated coating drum at elevated<br>
temperature until the desired content of catalytically active<br>
composition, based on the total catalyst weight, has been<br>
attained. It is also possible, according to DE 21 06 796, to<br>
carry out the application (coating) of the catalytically<br>
active composition to the inert support in fluidized bed<br>
coaters.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Preference is given to preparing coated catalysts by the<br>
application of a thin layer of 50 to 500 urn of the active<br>
components to an inert support (for example US 2,035,606).<br>
Useful supports have been found to be in particular spheres or<br>
hollow cylinders. These shaped bodies give, rise to a high<br>
packing density at low pressure drop and reduce the risk of<br>
formation of packing faults when the catalyst is charged into<br>
the reaction tubes.<br>
The melted and sintered shaped bodies have to be heat-resistant<br>
within the temperature range of the reaction as it proceeds. As<br>
detailed above, useful substances are, for example, silicon<br>
carbide, steatite, quartz, porcelain, SiO2, Al2O3 or clay earth.<br>
The advantage of the coating of support bodies in a fluidized<br>
bed is the high uniformity of the layer thickness, which plays a<br>
crucial role for the catalytic performance of the catalyst. A<br>
particularly uniform coating is obtained by spraying a<br>
suspension or solution of the active components onto the heated<br>
support at from 80 to 200°C in a fluidized bed, for example<br>
according to DE 12 80 756, DE 198 28 583 or DE 197 09 589. In<br>
contrast to the coating in coating drums, it is also possible,<br>
when hollow cylinders are used as a support in the fluidized bed<br>
processes mentioned, to uniformly coat the interior of the<br>
hollow cylinders. Among the abovementioned fluidized bed<br>
processes, the process according to DE 197 09 589 in particular<br>
is advantageous, since the predominantly horizontal, circular<br>
motion of the supports, in addition to uniform coating, also<br>
achieves low abrasion of apparatus parts.<br>
For the coating operation, the aqueous solution or suspension of<br>
the active components and of an organic binder, preferably a<br>
copolymer of vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl acetate/ethylene<br>
or styrene/acrylate, is sprayed via one or more nozzles onto the<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
heated, fluidized support. It is particularly favourable to<br>
introduce the spray liquid at the point of highest product<br>
speed, as the result of which the sprayed substance can be<br>
distributed uniformly in the bed. The spray operation is<br>
continued until either the suspension has been consumed or the<br>
required amount of active components has been applied to the<br>
support.<br>
In a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the<br>
catalytically active composition of the inventive catalyst,<br>
comprising the TiO2 as defined herein, is applied in a<br>
fluidized bed with the aid of suitable binders, so that a<br>
coated catalyst is obtained. Suitable binders include organic<br>
binders familiar to those skilled in the art, preferably<br>
copolymers, advantageously in the form of an aqueous<br>
dispersion, of vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl<br>
acetate/acrylate, styrene/acrylate, vinyl acetate/maleate and<br>
vinyl acetate/ethylene. Particular preference is given to<br>
using an organic polymeric or copolymeric adhesive, in<br>
particular a vinyl acetate copolymer adhesive, as the binder.<br>
The binder used is added in customary amounts to the<br>
catalytically active composition, for example at about 10 to<br>
20% by weight based on the solids content of the<br>
catalytically active composition. For example, reference can<br>
be made to EP 744 214. When the catalytically active<br>
composition is applied at elevated temperatures of about<br>
150°C, an application to the support without organic binders,<br>
as is known from the prior art, is also possible. Coating<br>
temperatures which can be used when the above-specified<br>
binders are used are, according to DE 21 06 796, for example,<br>
between about 50 and 450°C. The binders used burn off within<br>
a short time in the course of baking-out of the catalyst when<br>
the charged reactor is put into operation. The binders serve<br>
primarily to reinforce the adhesion of the catalytically<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
active composition on the support and to reduce attrition in<br>
the course of transport and charging of the catalyst.<br>
Further possible processes for preparing coated catalysts for<br>
the catalytic gas phase oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons to<br>
carboxylic acids and/or carboxylic anhydrides have been<br>
described, for example, in WO 98/00778 and EP-A 714 700.<br>
According to these, from a solution and/or a suspension of<br>
the catalytically active metal oxides and/or their precursor<br>
compounds, optionally in the presence of assistants for the<br>
catalyst preparation, a powder is prepared initially and is<br>
subsequently, for the catalyst preparation on the support,<br>
optionally after conditioning and also optionally after heat<br>
treatment to generate the catalytically active metal oxides,<br>
applied in coating form, and the support coated in this way<br>
is subjected to a heat treatment to generate the<br>
catalytically active metal oxides or to a treatment to remove<br>
volatile constituents.<br>
Suitable conditions for carrying out a process for the gas<br>
phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular for the<br>
preparation of phthalic anhydride from o-xylene and/or<br>
naphthalene, are likewise known to those skilled in the art<br>
from the prior art. In particular, reference is made to the<br>
comprehensive description in K. Towae, W. Enke, R. Jackh,<br>
N. Bhargana "Phthalic Acid and Derivatives" in Ullmann' s<br>
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Vol. A. 20, 1992, 181<br>
and this is incorporated by reference. For example, the<br>
boundary conditions known from the aforementioned reference,<br>
WO-A 98/37967 or WO 99/61433 may be selected for the steady<br>
operating state of the oxidation.<br>
To this end, the catalysts are initially charged into the<br>
reaction tubes of the reactor which are thermostatted<br>
externally to the reaction temperature, for example by means<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
of salt melts. The reaction gas is passed through the thus<br>
prepared catalyst bed at temperatures of generally from 300<br>
to 450°C, preferably from 320 to 420°C, and more preferably<br>
from 340 to 400°C, and at an elevated pressure of generally<br>
from 0.1 to 2.5 bar, preferably from 0.3 to 1.5 bar, at a<br>
space velocity of generally from 750 to 5000 h"1.<br>
The reaction gas fed to the catalyst is generally obtained by<br>
mixing a molecular oxygen-containing gas which, apart from<br>
oxygen, may also comprise suitable reaction moderators and/or<br>
diluents, such as steam, carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen, with<br>
the aromatic hydrocarbon to be oxidized, and the molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas may generally contain 1 to 100 mol%,<br>
preferably 2 to 50 mol% and more preferably 10 to 30 mol%, of<br>
oxygen, 0 to 30 mol%, preferably 0 to 10 mol%, of steam, and<br>
0 to 50 mol%, preferably 0 to 1 mol%, of carbon dioxide,<br>
remainder nitrogen. To obtain the reaction gas, the molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas is generally charged with 30 to 150 g<br>
per m3 (STP) of gas of the aromatic hydrocarbon to be<br>
oxidized.<br>
In a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the<br>
inventive catalyst has an active composition content between<br>
about 7 and 12% by weight, in particular between 8 and 10% by<br>
weight, the active composition (catalytically active<br>
composition) containing between 5 and 15% by weight of V205, 0<br>
and 4% by weight of Sb203, 0.2 and 0.75% by weight of Cs, 0<br>
and 3% by weight of Nb2Os. Apart from the components<br>
aforementioned, the remainder of the active composition<br>
comprises at least 90% by weight, preferably at least 95% by<br>
weight, further preferred at least 98% by weight, in<br>
particular at least 99% by weight, further preferred at least<br>
99.5% by weight, especially 100% by weight Ti02. Such an<br>
inventive catalyst may be used as such, or, for example, in<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
the case of a two-zone or multizone catalyst, as a first<br>
catalyst zone disposed toward the gas inlet side.<br>
In a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the BET<br>
surface area of the catalyst is between 15 and about 25 m2/g.<br>
It is further preferred that such a first catalyst zone has a<br>
length fraction of about 40 to 60% of the total length of all<br>
catalyst zones present (total length of the catalyst bed<br>
present).<br>
In a further preferred inventive embodiment, the inventive<br>
catalyst has an active composition content of about 6 to 11% by<br>
weight, in particular 7 to 9% by weight, the active composition<br>
containing 5 to 15% by weight of V205, 0 to 4% by weight of<br>
Sb203, 0.05 to 0.3% by weight of Cs, 0 to 2% by weight of Nb205.<br>
Apart from the components aforementioned, the remainder of<br>
the active composition comprises at least 90% by weight,<br>
preferably at least 95% by weight, further preferred at least<br>
98% by weight, in particular at least 99% by weight, further<br>
preferred at least 99.5% by weight, especially 100% by weight<br>
Ti02. Such an inventive catalyst may, for example, be used as<br>
the second catalyst zone, i.e. downstream of the first catalyst<br>
zone disposed toward the gas inlet side (cf. above). It is<br>
preferred that the catalyst has a BET surface area between about<br>
15 and 25 m2/g. It is further preferred that this second zone<br>
has a length fraction of about 10 to 30% of the total length of<br>
all catalyst zones present.<br>
In a further inventive embodiment, the inventive catalyst has an<br>
active composition content between about 5 and 10% by weight, in<br>
particular between 6 and 8% by weight, the active composition<br>
(catalytically active composition) containing 5 to 15% by weight<br>
of V205, 0 to 4% by weight of Sb203, 0 to 0.1% by weight of Cs, 0<br>
to 1% by weight of Nb205. Apart from the components<br>
aforementioned, the remainder of the active composition<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
comprises at least 90% by weight, preferably at least 95% by<br>
weight, further preferred at least 98% by weight, in<br>
particular at least 99% by weight, further preferred at least<br>
99.5% by weight, especially 100% by weight Ti02. Such an<br>
inventive catalyst may be used, for example, as the third<br>
catalyst zone disposed downstream of the above-described second<br>
catalyst zone. Preference is given to a BET surface area of the<br>
catalyst which is somewhat higher than that of the layers<br>
disposed closer to the gas inlet side, in particular in the<br>
range between about 25 to about 45 m2/g. It is further preferred<br>
that such a third catalyst zone has a length fraction of about<br>
10 to 50% of the total length of all catalyst zones present.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, the inventive<br>
multizone or multilayer catalysts, in particular having three<br>
or more layers, can be used particularly advantageously when<br>
the individual catalyst zones are present in a certain length<br>
ratio relative to one another.<br>
Thus, in a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the<br>
first catalyst zone disposed toward the gas inlet side has a<br>
length fraction, based on the total length of the catalyst<br>
bed, of at least 40%, in particular at least 45%, more<br>
preferably at least 50%. It is especially preferred that the<br>
proportion of the first catalyst zone in the total length of<br>
the catalyst bed is between 40 and 70%, in particular between<br>
40 and 55%, more preferably between 40 and 52%.<br>
The second zone takes up preferably about 10 to 40%, in<br>
particular about 10 to 30%, of the total length of the<br>
catalyst bed. It has also been found that, surprisingly, a<br>
ratio of the length of the third catalyst zone to the length<br>
of the second catalyst zone of between about 1 and 2, in<br>
particular between 1.2 and 1.7, more preferably between 1.3<br>
and 1.6, provides particularly good results with regard to<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
the economic viability such as the efficiency of raw material<br>
utilization and productivity of the catalyst.<br>
It has been found that the aforementioned selection of the<br>
length fractions of the individual catalyst zones enables<br>
particularly advantageous positioning of the hotspot, in<br>
particular in the first zone, and good temperature control<br>
for the prevention of excessively high hotspot temperatures<br>
even in the case of prolonged operating time of the catalyst.<br>
This improves the yield, in particular based on the lifetime<br>
of the catalyst. It is assumed, without the invention being<br>
restricted to this assumption, that the aforementioned zone<br>
length ratio of the individual catalyst zones relative to one<br>
another results in virtually full conversion of the o-xylene<br>
used actually within the second catalyst zone and thus, in<br>
the third catalyst zone with the advantages described above,<br>
in what is known as "product polishing", i.e. the cleaning of<br>
the reaction gas to free it of undesired by-products by<br>
oxidation to the actual product of value. In addition, it is<br>
known to those skilled in the art that, after a certain<br>
running time, such catalysts deactivate in the region of the<br>
hotspot (generally in the first zone). This deactivation<br>
results in a shifting of the reaction into the second, more<br>
active zone, which leads to very high hotspot temperatures<br>
and the associated problems in relation to selectivity and<br>
plant safety. The zone ratios selected in the inventive<br>
catalyst, in particular of the first zone, ensure a maximum<br>
residence time of the hotspot in the first zone with the<br>
known advantages, and the inventive length of the second and<br>
third zone at the same time ensures a minimum proportion of<br>
undesired by-products with simultaneously maximum yield of<br>
actual product of value.<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
The temperature management in the gas phase oxidation of<br>
o-xylene to phthalic anhydride is sufficiently well known to<br>
those skilled in the art from the prior art, and reference can<br>
be made, for example, to DE 100 40 827 A1.<br>
It is further preferred in accordance with the invention that,<br>
when the inventive catalyst is used in a multizone catalyst bed,<br>
the content of alkali metals in the catalyst zones falls from<br>
the gas inlet side toward the gas outlet side.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, particularly<br>
favourable three-zone or multizone catalysts can be obtained in<br>
many cases when the active composition content decreases from<br>
the first catalyst zone disposed toward the gas inlet side to<br>
the catalyst zone disposed toward the gas outlet side. It has<br>
been found to be advantageous that the first catalyst zone has<br>
an active composition content between about 7 and 12% by<br>
weight, in particular between about 8 and 11% by weight, the<br>
second catalyst zone has an active composition content<br>
between about 6 and 11% by weight, in particular between<br>
about 7 and 10% by weight, and the third catalyst zone has an<br>
active composition content between about 5 and 10% by weight,<br>
in particular between about 6 and 9% by weight.<br>
The terms first, second and third catalyst zone are used in<br>
conjunction with the present invention as follows: the first<br>
catalyst zone refers to the catalyst zone disposed toward the<br>
gas inlet side. Toward the gas outlet side, another two<br>
further catalyst zones are present in the inventive catalyst,<br>
which are referred to as the second and third catalyst zone.<br>
The third catalyst zone is closer to the gas outlet side than<br>
the second catalyst zone.<br>
In a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the<br>
inventive catalyst has three catalyst zones. In that case,<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
the third catalyst zone is at the gas outlet side. The<br>
presence of additional catalyst zones upstream of the first<br>
catalyst zone in the gas flow is, however, not ruled out. For<br>
example, in one inventive embodiment, the third catalyst zone<br>
as defined herein may be followed by another fourth catalyst<br>
zone (having an active composition content equal to or even<br>
lower than the third catalyst zone).<br>
According to the invention, the active composition content<br>
between the first and the second catalyst zone and/or between<br>
the second and the third catalyst zone may decrease.<br>
In a particularly preferred inventive embodiment, the active<br>
composition content decreases between the second and the<br>
third catalyst zone. It goes without saying that the active<br>
composition content never increases in the sequence of the<br>
catalyst zones from the gas inlet side to the gas outlet<br>
side, but at worst remains the same.<br>
It is assumed, without the invention being restricted to the<br>
correctness of this assumption, that, as a result of the<br>
different layer thicknesses, associated with the different<br>
active composition contents, of the catalytically active<br>
composition in the individual zones, more preferably the<br>
decreasing layer thicknesses of the catalytically active<br>
composition from the first to the third zone, firstly the<br>
reaction of o-xylene up to PA in the first and, if<br>
appropriate, second zone is influenced, and additionally, in<br>
the third zone with the even thinner layer of active<br>
composition, the remaining under-oxidation products are<br>
oxidized, for example phthalide to PA, but not PA to the<br>
over-oxidation products, for example COX. As a result, over<br>
the entire structured packing, the maximum productivity for<br>
the oxidation of o-xylene to PA is achieved at a minimum<br>
proportion of the undesired by-products.<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
In a preferred inventive embodiment, the BET surface area<br>
increases from the first catalyst zone disposed toward the<br>
gas inlet side to the third catalyst zone disposed toward the<br>
gas outlet side. Preferred ranges for the BET surface area<br>
are 15 to 25 m2/g for the first catalyst zone, 15 to 25 m2/g<br>
for the second catalyst zone and 25 to 45 m2/g for the third<br>
catalyst zone.<br>
In general, it is preferred in accordance with the invention<br>
that the BET surface area of the first catalyst zone is lower<br>
than the BET surface area of the third catalyst zone.<br>
Particularly advantageous catalysts are also obtained when<br>
the BET surface areas of the first and of the second catalyst<br>
zone are the same, while the BET surface area of the third<br>
catalyst zone is greater in comparison. The catalyst activity<br>
toward the gas inlet side, in a preferred inventive<br>
embodiment, is lower than the catalyst activity toward the<br>
gas outlet side.<br>
In principle, in addition to the Ti02 defined in detail herein,<br>
there may also be a blend with another titanium dioxide of<br>
another specification, i.e. another BET surface area,<br>
porosimetry and/or particle size distribution. However, it is<br>
preferred in accordance with the invention that at least 50%, in<br>
particular at least 75%, more preferably all, of the TiO2 used<br>
has a BET surface area and porosimetry as defined herein, and<br>
preferably also has the particle size distribution described. It<br>
is also possible to use blends of different TiO2 materials.<br>
It has also been found that, in a preferred embodiment, in<br>
accordance with the invention, catalysts which do not have any<br>
phosphorus in the catalytically active composition, in<br>
combination with the TiO2 used in accordance with the invention,<br>
enable particularly good activities with simultaneously very<br>
high selectivity. It is further preferred that at least 0.05% by<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
weight of the catalytically active composition is formed by at<br>
least one alkali metal calculated as alkali metal(s). The alkali<br>
metal used is more preferably caesium.<br>
In addition, according to the inventor' s results, in one<br>
embodiment, it is preferred that the inventive catalyst contains<br>
niobium' in an amount of from 0.01 to 2% by weight, in particular<br>
from 0.5 to 1% by weight, of the catalytically active<br>
composition.<br>
The inventive catalysts are typically thermally treated or<br>
calcined (conditioned) before use. It has been found to be<br>
advantageous when the catalyst is calcined in an O2-containing<br>
gas, in particular in air, at at least 390°C for at least 24<br>
hours, in particular at at least 400°C for between 24 and 72<br>
hours. The temperatures should preferably not exceed about<br>
500°C, in particular about 470°C. However, other calcination<br>
conditions which appear suitable to those skilled in the art are<br>
not fundamentally ruled out.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process<br>
for preparing a catalyst according to one of the preceding<br>
claims, comprising the following steps:<br>
a.	providing a catalytically active composition as<br>
defined herein, comprising the TiO2 characterized in<br>
detail above;<br>
b.	providing an inert support, in particular an inert<br>
shaped support body;<br>
c.	applying the catalytically active composition to the<br>
inert support, in particular in a fluidized bed.<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention also relates to the<br>
use of titanium dioxide as defined above for preparing a<br>
catalyst, in particular for the gas phase oxidation of<br>
hydrocarbons, preferably for the gas phase oxidation of o-xylene<br>
and/or naphthalene to phthalic anhydride.<br>
METHODS<br>
To determine the parameters of the inventive catalysts, the<br>
methods which follow are used:<br>
1.	BET surface area:<br>
The determination is effected by the BET method according to<br>
DIN 66131; a publication of the BET method can also be found<br>
in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60, 309 (1938) .<br>
2.	Pore radius distribution:<br>
The pore radius distribution and the pore volume of the TiO2<br>
used were determined by means of mercury porosimetry to<br>
DIN 66133; maximum pressure: 2000 bar, Porosimeter 4000 (from<br>
Porotec, Germany), according to the manufacturer' s<br>
instructions.<br>
3.	Primary crystal sizes:<br>
The primary crystal sizes (primary particle sizes) were<br>
determined by powder X-ray diffractometry. The analysis was<br>
carried out with an instrument from Bruker, Germany: BRUKER<br>
AXS - D4 Endeavor. The resulting X-ray diffractograms were<br>
recorded with the "DiffracPlus D4 Measurement" software<br>
package according to the manufacturer' s instructions, and the<br>
half-height width of the 100% reflection was evaluated with<br>
the "DiffracPlus Evaluation" software by the Debye-Scherrer<br>
formula according to the manufacturer' s instructions in order<br>
to determine the primary crystal size.<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
4.	Particle sizes:<br>
The particle sizes were determined by the laser diffraction<br>
method with a Fritsch Particle Sizer Analysette 22 Economy<br>
(from Fritsch, Germany) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions, also with regard to the sample pretreatment:<br>
the sample is homogenized in deionized water without addition<br>
of assistants and treated with ultrasound for 5 minutes.<br>
5.	Alkali content of TiO2:<br>
The alkali content of TiO2 is determined according to DIN ISO<br>
9964-3. Thus, alkali may be determined by ICP-AES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) and<br>
optionally added to the total alkali content of Ti02.<br>
6.	Bulk density:<br>
The bulk density was determined with the aid of the Ti02 used to<br>
prepare the catalyst (dried at 150°C under reduced pressure,<br>
uncalcined). The resulting values from three determinations were<br>
averaged.<br>
The bulk density was determined by introducing 100 g of the<br>
TiO2 material into a 1000 mi container and shaken for approx.<br>
30 seconds.<br>
A measuring cylinder (capacity precisely 100 ml) is weighed<br>
empty to 10 mg. Above it, the powder funnel is secured over<br>
the opening of the cylinder using a clamp stand and clamp.<br>
After the stopwatch has been started, the measuring cylinder<br>
is charged with the TiO2 material within 15 seconds. The<br>
spatula is used to constantly supply more filling material,<br>
so that the measuring cylinder is always slightly overfilled.<br>
After 2 minutes, the spatula is used to level off the excess,<br>
care being taken that no pressing forces compress the<br>
material in the cylinder. The filled measuring- cylinder is<br>
brushed off and weighed.<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
The bulk density is reported in g/ml.<br>
The BET surface area, the pore radius distribution and the<br>
pore volume, and also the primary crystal sizes and the<br>
particle size distribution were determined for the titanium<br>
dioxide in each case on the uncalcined material dried at<br>
150°C under reduced pressure.<br>
The data in the present description with regard to the BET<br>
surface areas of the catalysts or catalyst zones also relate<br>
to the BET surface areas of the Ti02 material used in each<br>
case (dried at 150CC under reduced pressure, uncalcined, see<br>
above).<br>
In general, the BET surface area of the catalyst is<br>
determined by virtue of the BET surface area of the Ti02 used,<br>
although the addition of further catalytically active<br>
components does change the BET surface area to a certain<br>
extent. This is familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
The active composition content (content of the catalytically<br>
active composition, without binder) relates in each case to<br>
the content (in % by weight) of the catalytically active<br>
composition in the total weight of the catalyst including<br>
support in the particular catalyst zone, measured after<br>
conditioning at 400°C over 4 h.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in detail with<br>
reference to the nonrestrictive examples which follow:<br>

trioxide, 1.08 g of caesium carbonate, 1.5 g of ammonium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, 178.62 g of titanium dioxide, 130.5 g of<br>
binder (see Example 1) and 2000 g of water. The active<br>
composition was applied in the form of thin layers.<br>
