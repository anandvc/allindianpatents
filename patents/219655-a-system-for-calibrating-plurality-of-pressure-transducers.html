				<td>AN IMPROVED SYSTEM FOR CALIBRATION OF PRESSURE<br>
TRANSDUCERS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a system for calibrating plurality of pressure<br>
transducers, said system comprising plurality of pressure transducers (13.1 to 13.n).<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a system which facilitates the study<br>
of temperature-dependence sensitivity of a plurality of pressure transducers, said<br>
system improves the calibration accuracy by providing a means to circumvent the<br>
temperature sensitivity of a standard pressure transducer against which the pressure<br>
transducers are calibrated. The system also improves the calibration resolution by<br>
providing a means to calibrate the pressure transducer at close pressure intervals said<br>
system also minimizes the stabilization time for the pressure input at the transducers<br>
and thereby reducing the time duration required for calibration.<br>
Background Art<br>
Hitherto known systems for calibration of pressure transducers [P.N. Modi and S.M.<br>
Seth. "Fluid Pressure and Its Measurement", Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics. 1392<br>
pp. (1981)] describe a Dead-Weight Pressure Gauge wherein a cylindrical plunger<br>
slides within a vertical hollow cylinder, which is filled with oil. A pressure transducer,<br>
which is to be calibrated, is set in parallel with the dead-weight gauge. Viscous oil is<br>
slowly pumped into the cylinder (and the pressure inlet of the said pressure transducer<br>
to be calibrated). The oil, which enters the cylinder under pressure, exerts a force on<br>
the plunger, thereby lifting the plunger and balancing it against the oil pressure. This<br>
force is balanced by the weights loaded on the top of the plunger. When the oil<br>
pressure and the weights balance, the oil pressure is known from the weights and the<br>
diameter of the plunger. The pressure of the oil being thus known, the attached<br>
pressure transducer can be calibrated. The plunger can be loaded with various known<br>
weights, and the pressure transducer can be calibrated against the corresponding<br>
pressure values. The disadvantage of this arrangement is the error involved in the<br>
estimated oil-pressure due to frictional resistance offered to the motion of the plunger<br>
in the cylinder. This error can be minimized if the plunger is carefully ground, so as to<br>
fit with the least permissible clearance in the cylinder, but not completely removed.<br>
Moreover, the whole mass needs to be rotated by hand before the readings are taken.<br>
Another drawback is that the number of calibrated weights available with a deadweight<br>
tester is limited, thereby impeding the calibration of the pressure transducer at<br>
close pressure intervals.<br>
An alternate system. [T.G. Beckwith and N.L. Buck, "Measurement of Pressure",<br>
Mechanical Measurements, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 642 pp. (1969)],<br>
describes a dead-weight tester commonly used as a source of static pressure for<br>
calibration purposes, and is basically a pressure-producing and pressure-measuring<br>
device, wherein the resulting pressure is estimated from knowledge of the applied<br>
weights and the piston area. In this device, the pressure transducer to be calibrated is<br>
connected to a chamber filled with a fluid (oil) whose pressure can be adjusted by<br>
some type of pump and bleed valve. The chamber also connects with a vertical pistoncvlinder<br>
to which various standard weights may be applied. The pressure is slowly<br>
built up until the piston and weights are seen to "float", at which point the fluid<br>
"gage"' pressure (i.e.. pressure above atmosphere) must equal the deadweight<br>
supported by the piston, divided by the piston area. A drawback of this methodology<br>
is that a number of refinements and corrections are necessary to achieve highly<br>
accurate results. The frictional force between the cylinder and piston must be reduced<br>
to a minimum and/or corrected for. Another drawback is that corrections are needed<br>
for temperature effects on areas of piston and cylinder, air and pressure-medium<br>
buoyancy effects, local gravity conditions, and height differences between the lower<br>
end of the piston and the reference point for the pressure transducer being calibrated.<br>
Further, as the piston assembly itself has weight, conventional dead-weight gages are<br>
not capable of measuring pressures lower than the piston weight/area ratio.<br>
Another system, [E.O. Doebelin, "Pressure and Sound Measurements", Measurement<br>
Systems: Application and Design (3rd Edition, International Student Edition), pp. 404-<br>
462 (1983)], describes a U-tube manometer whose operation is based on the<br>
comparison of the unknown pressure (P) with the gravity (g), based on the wellknown<br>
expression; P= hpg, where h is the height of the liquid column in the tube, and<br>
p is the density of the liquid. The cross-sectional area of the tubing (even if not<br>
uniform) has no effect. At a given location i i value of g) the sensitivity depends<br>
on only the density of the manometer fluid. An advantage of this device is that it is<br>
self-balancing and has a continuous rather than stepwise output. However, a<br>
disadvantage of this device is that it becomes unwieldy at high pressures because of<br>
the long liquid columns involved. Further, to realize the high accuracy possible with<br>
manometers, often a number of corrections need to be applied. When visual reading<br>
of the height h is employed, the engraved-scale's temperature expansion must be<br>
considered. The variation of the value of p of the manometer fluid with temperature<br>
must be corrected and the local value of g determined. Additional sources of error<br>
are found in the non-verticality of the tubes and the difficulty in reading h because of<br>
the meniscus formed by capillarity.<br>
Yet another system [S. Varnagy, "Pressure Calibration Systems and Control Valve<br>
Assemblies'. U.S. Patent No. 4,698,998 {assigned to Consolidated Controls<br>
Corporation} describes a pressure calibration system for calibrating high-pressure<br>
transducers and gaging systems. The said pressure calibration system incorporates a<br>
pressure cylinder, which is filled with compressed nitrogen gas through a fill port.<br>
The pressure cylinder is filled, from an external tank of compressed nitrogen, by<br>
pneumatically connecting them through a "pressure cable" hose and a plurality of<br>
pressure regulator valves, pressure isolation valves, vent valves, vent isolation valves,<br>
side ports, end ports, vernier balancing conduits, and knobs. A "supply pressure" gage<br>
mounted on the front-panel of the pressure calibration system indicates the pressure in<br>
the internal storage tank. A test port provided on the front panel of the calibration<br>
system provides a means for connection of the pressure equipment that is to be<br>
calibrated. The calibration of the pressure transducer/gauge is performed against a<br>
self-calibrating pressure transducer. An advantage of the system of this invention is<br>
that it is self-contained and portable, and incorporate control valves and isolation<br>
valves, thereby providing positive shutoff, combined with extremely low torque<br>
operation, permitting fine manual adjustment of calibration pressure. Another<br>
advantage of this system is that it is capable of providing pressure calibration over a<br>
working range extending from a vacuum to 10,000 psi. A disadvantage of this system,<br>
however, is that its calibration accuracy is limited by the temperature-sensitivity of<br>
the pressure-standard against which the pressure calibration is performed. Another<br>
limitation of this system is that it does not provide a means to study the temperaturedependence<br>
of the pressure transducers being calibrated. Yet another disadvantage of<br>
this system is that the number of pressure transducers that can be calibrated<br>
simultaneously is limited to two.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a system for calibrating a<br>
plurality of pressure transducers simultaneously.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mounting means having the<br>
facility for uniform pressure distribution so that all the pressure transducers to be<br>
calibrated are simultaneously subjected to the same pressure.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system that facilitates study<br>
of temperature-dependence sensitivity of pressure transducers by locating the said<br>
pressure transducers together with their common mounting means in a medium<br>
whose temperature can be maintained constant at a given desired value during a given<br>
set of input pressure values, and altered to a different constant temperature value<br>
during a subsequent set of input pressure values as required during calibration.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system wherein a means is<br>
provided to circumvent the temperature-sensitivity of the pressure-standard against<br>
which the pressure transducers are calibrated, thereby improving the calibration<br>
accuracy of the system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a system wherein a means is<br>
provided to calibrate the pressure transducers at close pressure intervals, thereby<br>
improving the calibration resolution.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide a system wherein a means is<br>
provided to minimize the time taken for the input pressure to get stabilized, thereby<br>
increasing time duration taken for calibrating.<br>
Detailed description of the present invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for calibrating plurality of<br>
pressure transducers, said system comprising plurality of pressure transducers (13.1 to<br>
13.n) mounted on a mounting means (12) which receives pressure input from a<br>
pressure source (11) via a hollow cylinder (14) and distributes the pressure evenly to<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the means for mounting (12) the pressure<br>
transducers ( 1 3 . 1 to 13.n) comprises of a cylindrical body having an input channel<br>
(30) connected to the hollow cylinder (14) via a link 31 and an adapter (32) to receive<br>

(30) and then directed via the channels (26.1 to 26.n) to the inputs of the pressure<br>
transducers (13.1 to 13.n) to enable all transducers to be stabilized simultaneously,<br>
after a change in the input pressure.<br>

pressure transmission medium.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the pressure transmission medium<br>
is a liquid.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, said liquid is oil or water.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the plurality of transducers (13.1 to 13.n)<br>
are connected to a display or recording medium (20) for displaying or recording the<br>
pressure output from the pressure transducers.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the display or recording medium (20)<br>

is already calibrated.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the standard pressure transducer is a piezo<br>
electric transducer or any other conventional transducer having high accuracy.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the standard pressure transducer is<br>
kept inside a vessel (18) and is connected to the pressure source through a hollow pipe<br>
(21).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the vessel (18) is provided with<br>

transducer( 17) is connected to a display or i,~urding medium (19) for displaying or<br>
recording the pressure output.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the length of the pipes 14 and 21 are such<br>
that the pressure being applied to the pressure transducers (13.1 to 13.n) that are to be<br>

channels from the dead weight tester to the standard pressure transducer and the<br>
transducers to the calibrated are same.<br>

are such that minimum stabilization time is achieved after a step change in the input<br>
pressure.<br>
The improved system for calibration of pressure transducers of the present invention<br>
provides for:<br>
1. A means for simultaneous calibration of a multiplicity of pressure transducers<br>
by locating them on a mounting means having the facility for uniform pressure<br>
distribution so that all the pressure transducers to be calibrated are<br>
simultaneously subjected to the same pressure. The system of the present<br>
invention provides for a circular mounting means wherein a number of equally<br>
spaced slots provided on its flat surface are used for locating the pressure inlet<br>
of the pressure transducers to be calibrated. These slots are hydraulically<br>
connected to the central axis of the said circular mounting means via internal<br>
channels drilled radially from the side wall of the said system into its central<br>
axis, which in turn is hydraulically connected to a pressure source via a<br>
separate internal channel.<br>
2. Study of temperature-sensitivity of a multiplicity of pressure transducers by<br>
locating the said pressure transducers together with their common mounting<br>
means in a medium whose temperature can be maintained constant at a given<br>
desired value during a given set of input pressure values. The pressure<br>
transducers together with their common mounting means are located in a<br>
vessel of suitable size wherein a sufficient quantity of water is preserved to<br>
immerse the pressure transducers to the desired level thereby maintaining the<br>
transducers at a desired constant temperature. The temperature of the water<br>
medium that surrounds all the pressure-transducers is monitored with a<br>
calibrated digital thermometer for temperature reading without parallax errors,<br>
and the desired constant temperature is maintained throughout a given<br>
calibration by addition of appropriate quantity of cooled/heated water<br>
followed by vigorous stirring. Different sets of calibration can be performed at<br>
various desired constant temperatures.<br>
3. Improving the calibration accuracy by providing a means to circumvent the<br>
temperature sensitivity of the pressure-standard against which the pressure<br>
transducers are calibrated. Amongst the currently available pressure standards,<br>
those that provide the finest pressure resolution are the quartz pressure<br>
transducers that are operated at the optimum constant ambient temperature as<br>
reported by J.M. Paros [in "Digital Pressure Transducer", U.S. Patent No.<br>
4.455,874(1984)], and further reported by R. B. Wearn, Jr., and J.M. Paros [in<br>
"Measurements of dead weight tester performance using high resolution<br>
quartz crystal pressure transducers", Instrument Society of America. 8pp,<br>
[(1988)]. The calibration accuracy of the system of the present invention is<br>
improved by locating the quartz pressure transducer (pressure-standard) in a<br>
fluid medium (water) whose temperature can be maintained constant at the<br>
optimum temperature at which it provides the best results.<br>
4. Improving the calibration resolution by providing a means to calibrate the<br>
pressure transducer/transducers at close pressure intervals. In the system of the<br>
present invention, the pressure-standard is a quartz pressure transducer whose<br>
output is in digital format and provides fine pressure resolution as reported<br>
by J.M. Paros [in "Digital Pressure Transducers", Measurements &amp; Data, Vol.<br>
10, No.2, 6p (1976)]; D.W. Busse [in "Digital Quartz Pressure Transducers for<br>
Air Data Applications", pp. V-7-1 to V-7-15 (1978)]; R.B. Wearn and N.G.<br>

Transducers", Deep-Sea Res., Vol. 29 A, pp. 111-134 (1982); D.W. Busse [in<br>

digital display of its output.<br>

The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings which are given solely for the purpose of understanding the<br>
invention and hence, should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any<br>
manner.<br>
Fig. 1 represents a typical design example, showing a conventional dead-weight tester<br>
system of the prior art used for calibration of a pressure transducer, which consists<br>
primarily of a chamber [1], a vertical cylinder [2], a piston [3] to which various<br>
standard weights [4] are applied to build up pressure in the oil [5] that is the common<br>
pressure transmission medium, a dial gage [6] that indicates the pressure of the oil, a<br>
pressure transducer [7] to be calibrated, an adjustable piston [8] with a handle [9,]<br>
and a bleed valve [10] for fine adjustment of the oil-pressure.<br>
Fig. 2 is an isometric view of the improved system for calibration of pressure<br>
transducers of the present invention, which consists primarily of a dead-weight tester<br>
[11] with its dial-gauge [25], which is similar to that shown in Fig. 1, a pressuretransducer-<br>
mounting means [12] that can accommodate a multiplicity of pressure<br>
transducers [13.1], ...[13.n], hollow cylinder [14] for pressure transmission to the<br>
mounting means [12], vessel [15] that holds temperature-controlled water around the<br>
multiplicity of pressure transducers to be calibrated, a thermometer [16] for sensing<br>
the temperature of the water in the said vessel [15], temperature display unit [22] for<br>
digital display of temperature of the water in the vessel [15], precision pressure<br>
transducer [17] that is used as a pressure-standard, vessel [18] that holds temperaturecontrolled<br>
water around the pressure-standard [17], a display/recording medium [19]<br>
that displays/records the pressure output of the pressure-standard, a thermometer [23]<br>
for sensing the temperature of the water in the vessel [18], temperature display unit<br>
[24] for digital display of temperature of the water in the vessel [18], and a computer<br>
means [20] that displays/records the outputs of the multiplicity of pressure transducers<br>
that are to be calibrated simultaneously. In the system of the present invention, the<br>
dead-weight tester [11 ], is used merely as a tool for varying the fluid pressure, and not<br>
as a pressure-calibrator. The lengths of the tubes [14] and [21], which form the<br>
pressure channels to the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12] and precision<br>
pressure transducer [17] that is used as a pressure-standard (i.e., the pressurecalibrator)<br>
respectively, are such that the total distance of the pressure channels from<br>
the dead-weight tester to the pressure-calibrator and the transducers to be calibrated<br>
are close to each other, thereby achieving minimal stabilization time after a step<br>
change in the input pressure.<br>
Fig. 3 is a mid-planar cross-sectional view of the pressure-transducer-mounting means<br>
[12] of the present invention, shown in an isometric style, wherein a multiplicity of<br>
pressure transducers [13.1], ...[13.n] can be located such that pressure is equally<br>
transmitted to all the said transducers in the minimum possible time, via channels<br>
[26.1. ..26.n], thereby achieving minimal stabilization time after a step change in the<br>
input pressure. These channels are closed at the periphery of the pressure-transducermounting<br>
means [12] using plugs [27.1],.... [27.n], which are leak-protected using<br>
copper washers [28.1], .... [28.n]. The pressure inlet of the pressure transducers<br>
[13.1],..[13.n] to be calibrated intersect at the bottom of the slots [29.1],..[29.n] that<br>
are located on the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12]. The link [31] and<br>
adapter [32] together facilitate an excellent pressure-tight joint between the pressure<br>
tube [14] and the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12]. In the pressuretransducer-<br>
mounting means [12], the pressure is diverted first into its central portion<br>
via channel [30] and then diverted into the pressure port of the transducers that are<br>
equidistant from the central portion of the mounting means, thereby enabling all the<br>
transducers to be stabilized simultaneously.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a typical example illustrating the usefulness of the improved system for<br>
calibration of pressure transducers of the present invention, wherein the temperaturesensitivity<br>
of two pressure transducers have been obtained from their simultaneous<br>
calibration at 6 different ambient temperar it ascending input pressure steps.<br>
These transducers are of the strain-gauge type ,; described by A. Joseph [in "Modern<br>
techniques of sea level measurement", Encyclopedia of Microcomputers. Marcel<br>
Dekker, Inc., New York, Vol. 23, pp. 319-344 (1999)], and temperature-compensated<br>
partially, although use of any other type of pressure transducers does not limit the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the temperature-dependence of two strain-gauge pressure transducers as<br>
obtained from their simultaneous calibration at 6 different ambient temperatures using<br>
the calibration system of the present invention at descending input pressure steps.<br>
The present invention provides an improved system for calibration of pressure<br>
transducers, which comprises of a dead-weight tester [11] with its dial-gauge [25], a<br>
pressure-transducer-mounting means [12] that can accommodate a multiplicity of<br>
pressure transducers [13.1], ...[13.n], hollow cylinder [14] for pressure transmission<br>
to the mounting means [12], vessel [15] that holds temperature-controlled water<br>
around the multiplicity of pressure transducers to be calibrated, a thermometer [16]<br>
for sensing the temperature of the water in the said vessel [15], temperature display<br>
unit [22] for digital display of temperature of the water in the vessel [15]. precision<br>
pressure transducer [17] that is used as a pressure-standard, vessel [18] that holds<br>
temperature-controlled water around the pressure-standard [17], a display/recording<br>
medium [19] that displays/records the pressure output of the pressure-standard, a<br>
thermometer [23] for sensing the temperature of the water in the vessel [18],<br>
temperature display unit [24] for digital display of temperature of the water in the<br>
vessel [18], and a computer [20] that displays/records the outputs of the multiplicity<br>
of pressure transducers that are to be calibrated simultaneously.<br>
The dead-weight tester [11] is used merely as a tool for varying the fluid pressure, and<br>
not as a pressure-calibrator.<br>
The lengths of the tubes [14] and [21], which form the pressure channels to the<br>
pressure-transducer-mounting means [12] and precision pressure transducer [17] that<br>
is used as a pressure-standard (i.e., the pressure-calibrator) respectively, are such that<br>
the total distance of the pressure channels from the dead-weight tester to the<br>
pressure-calibrator and the transducers to be calibrated are close to each other, thereby<br>
achieving minimal stabilization time after a step change in the input pressure.<br>
A multiplicity of pressure transducers [13.1], ...[13.n] can be located such that<br>
pressure is equally transmitted to all the said transducers in the minimum possible<br>
time, via channels [26.1, ..26.n], thereby achieving minimal stabilization time after a<br>
step change in the input pressure. These channels are closed at the periphery of the<br>
pressure-transducer-mounting means [12] using plugs [27.1],.... [27.n], which are<br>
leak-protected using copper washers [28.1], .... [28.n]. The pressure inlet of the<br>
pressure transducers [13.1]...[13.n] to be calibrated intersect at the bottom of the slots<br>
|29.1],..[29.n] that are located on the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12]. The<br>
link [31] and adapter [32] together facilitate an excellent pressure-tight joint between<br>
the pressure tube [14] and the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12].<br>
In the pressure-transducer-mounting means [12], the pressure is diverted first into its<br>
central portion via channel [30] and then diverted into the pressure port of the<br>
transducers that are equidistant from the central portion of the mounting means,<br>
thereby enabling all the transducers to be stabilized simultaneously.<br>
The device of the present invention has been successfully implemented to calibrate<br>
strain-gauge pressure transducers that are used in sea level gauges, although use of<br>
any other type of pressure transducers does not limit the scope of the present<br>
invention. In this, each '-et of calibration was performed at various preplanned<br>
temperatures to study the temperature-sensitivity of these transducers. It was observed<br>
that the device of the present invention worked efficiently and without any problems.<br>
THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
1. It provides a means for simultaneous calibration of a multiplicity of pressure<br>
transducers by locating them on a mounting means having the facility for<br>
uniform pressure distribution.<br>
2. It facilitates the study of temperature-sensitivity of pressure transducers by<br>
locating the said pressure transducers together with their common mounting<br>
means in a medium whose temperature can be maintained constant at a given<br>
desired value during a given set of input pressure values, and altered to a<br>
different constant temperature value during a subsequent set of input pressure<br>
values as required during calibration.<br>
3. It improves the calibration accuracy by providing a means to<br>
circumvent the temperature sensitivity of the pressure-standard against<br>
which the pressure transducers are calibrated, by locating the said pressurestandard<br>
in a medium whose temperature can be maintained constant at the<br>
optimum temperature at which it provides the best results.<br>
I. It improves the calibration resolution by providing a means to calibrate the<br>
pressure transducers at close pressure intervals, by the use of an accurate<br>
pressure-standard having fine pressure resolution and a capability for digital<br>
display of its output.<br><br><br><br>
