[See Section 10; rule 13] "A seat with a seat attachment structure for a scooter type vehicle"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1 Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
213/MUM/2002 <br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field of the-Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a seat attachment structure for scooter type vehicles in which the seat can be locked reliably with a small operating physical force;<br>
[0002] [Description of the Related Art]<br>
The scooter type vehicle employs a structure in which the seat is hinged and provided with a storage space under the seat for storing a helmet, or the like.<br>
As an attachment structure of the seat of this type, for example, "Seat attachment structure for scooter type vehicles" disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No.203443/1998 is known.<br>
[0003]<br>
In Fig. 2 of the aforementioned publication, a seat attachment structure in which a first angular U-shaped fitting 58 and a second angular U-shaped fitting 59 are mounted under the hinged seat 16 that is to be used by both of the driver and the occupant, the first angular U-shaped fitting 58 is<br><br>
engaged with the first seat locking mechanism 100 mounted on the vehicle body, and the second angular U-shaped fitting 59 is engaged with the second seat locking mechanism 120 is disclosed.<br>
[0004]<br>
As shown in Fig. 11 of the aforementioned publication, a technology in which the first seat locking mechanism 100 is provided with a locking claw 104 and a relay arm 108 for maintaining the locking claw 104 in the locked condition by being pressed against the locking claw 104, and as shown in Fig. 13 of the aforementioned publication, the second seat locking mechanism 120 is provided with a locking claw 124, and the relay arm 108 and the locking claw 124 are connected by the second wire 136 is disclosed.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the aforementioned technology, since the seat 16 is large, when closing the seat, the seat 16 must be closed so that engagement between the first angular U-shaped fitting 58 and the first seat locking mechanism 100 and engagement between the second angular U-shaped fitting 59 remote from the first angular U-shaped fitting 58 and the second seat locking mechanism 120 occur almost simultaneously because of the effect of the dimensional accuracy or the accuracy of attachment to the vehicle body of the first and the second angular U-shaped<br><br>
fittings 58, 59, and the first and the second seat locking mechanisms 100, 120, or of rigidity of the seat 16.<br>
[0006]<br>
In this case, the portion of the seat 16 above the first and the second angular U-shaped fittings 58, 59 must be pressed with a large force, or the seat 16 must be fully opened and then closed again so as to make these two points are completely engaged with each other. Therefore, improvement in operationality of the seat 16 has been desired.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention is to improve the seat attachment structure for scooter type vehicles, in which the seat can be locked reliably with a small operating physical force.<br>
[0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present invention according to Claim 1 is a scooter type vehicle wherein an opening of the storage box for storing a helmet or the like is closed by a seat which is elongated in the fore-and-aft direction and attached with a hinge so as to be opened and closed freely, a plurality of seat hooks are attached on the lower surface of the seat, and a main locking mechanism and a sub- locking mechanism are attached on the vehicle body for being engaged with the seat hooks, so that the seat is locked<br><br>
by the main and sub-locking mechanism characterized in that the hinge is attached at one end of the seat, the seat hook for the main locking mechanism is attached at the other end of the seat, the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached substantially at the center of the seat, and the main locking mechanism and the sub-locking mechanisms are connected by a connecting member such as a wire or the like so that when the main locking mechanism is locked by the external force, the sub-locking mechanism is also brought into the locked state in conjunction therewith.<br>
[0009]<br>
When locking the main locking mechanism, the sub-locking mechanism may also be brought into the locked state in conjunction therewith. Therefore, the locking operation of the main and sub- locking mechanisms may be performed easily as a job lot. As a consequent, the requirement of some getting used to the operation of the seat as in the case of the related art in which a plurality of locking mechanisms are provided at a plurality of locations does not exist in this invention, and the seat can be locked easily and reliably.<br>
[0010]<br>
By providing a seat hook for the main locking mechanism at the other end of the seat, the seat hook for the main locking mechanism may be positioned at the farthest point form the hinge attached at one end of the seat. Therefore, when locking the<br><br>
main locking mechanism by pressing the end of the seat above the main locking mechanism downward by hand, a downward pressing force required to be exerted on the seat for generating a moment about the hinge may be reduced. For example, according to the present invention, only a smaller operating force is required for locking the seat in comparison with the case in which the seat hook for the main locking mechanism is attached at the center of the seat and the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached at the other end of the seat so that the seat is closed by pressing the central portion of the seat downward.<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that each of the seat hooks is formed into an angular U-shape having a straight portion along the length of the seat so that the straight portions are engaged with the main and sub locking mechanisms respectively.<br>
[0012]<br>
The dimensional errors of the seat hook, the main locking mechanism, and the sub locking mechanism, the errors in attachment of these members, or the positional errors of engagement between the seat hook and each locking mechanism due to rigidity of the seat may be absorbed by the length of the straight portion of the seat hook, and thus the main and sub locking mechanisms may be locked reliably without the<br><br>
influence of the aforementioned errors.<br>
[0013]<br>

[0043] i<br>
The present invention is characterized in that the heat shielding plate for preventing thermal effect from the engine 211 (See Fig. 6) and the radiator 221 (See Fig. 6) is divided into four members represented by the reference numerals 241,<br>
242,	243, 243, and the divided heat shielding plates 241, 242,<br>
243,	243 are arranged in the vicinity of the front surface, the rear surface, the left surface, and the right surface of the fuel tank 230 respectively.<br>
Since the divided heat shielding plates 241, 242, 243, 343 are employed, the extent of thermal effect from the engine<br><br><br>
211 and from the radiator 221 can be taken into consideration, and their size may be arbitrarily minimized depending on the configuration of each surface of the fuel tank 230. As a result, each heat shielding plate 241, 242, 243, 243 may be relatively small in size, and may be manufactured extremely easily. In addition, since the molding die may be small in size and thus it requires only a small amount of material, the manufacturing cost may be reduced as well.<br>
[0044]<br>
The front shielding plate 241 covering the front surface of the fuel tank 230 is a resin sheet of a hard resin or the like in substantially square in front view. Since the front heat shielding plate 241 is formed of a resin sheet, it is very simple in shape and may thus be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
[0045]<br>
The rear heat shielding plate 242 covering the rear surface of the fuel tank 230 is a rubber sheet in substantially square in shape, and comprises two hooking holes 242a, 242a at the upper left and right corners thereof, and one hooking hole 242b at the bottom thereof.<br>
The left and right heat shielding plates 243, 243 for covering the lower half portion of the left surface and the lower half portion of the right surface of the fuel tank 230 are formed of rubber sheets having two hooking holes 243a, 243a at the upper left and right corners thereof.<br><br><br>
As described above, the rear heat shielding plate 242 and the left and right shielding plates 243, 243 are freely deformable and freely arranged depending on the space around the fuel tank 230 because they are formed of rubber sheets. It can also be arranged easily using a small space around the fuel tank 230 effectively. In addition, since the rear heat shielding plate 242 and the left and right heat shielding plates 243, 243 formed of sheets are employed, they may be very simple in shape and may be manufactured at lower cost.<br>
[0046]<br>
Referring back to Fig. 6, the description will be continued.<br>
The front heat shielding plate 241 is a member which also serves as a cooling air guide of the radiator 221 by being disposed between the down tube 114 extending downward from the head pipe 111 and the fuel tank 230, and being detachably mounted on the front cross member 151. Therefore, the upper end of the front heat shielding plate 241 is curved toward the upper portion of the radiator 221, and the lower end of the front heat shielding plate 241 extends to the level below the radiator 221.<br>
As described above, since the front heat shielding plate 241 is disposed between the down tube 114 and the fuel tank 230, the front heat shielding plate 241 can easily be mounted to the down tube 114. Therefore, the efficiency of mounting<br><br><br>
operation of the front heat shielding plate 241 is ensured.<br>
[0047]<br>
The rear heat shielding plate 242 can be detachably mounted on the vehicle body frame 110 by hooking the upper portion on the headed pin 144, and hooking the lower portion on the hook 148.<br>
The left and right heat shielding plates 243, 243 (only left one is shown in the figure) can be detachably mounted on the vehicle body frame 110 by hooking the upper portion on the headed pin 144....<br>
[0048]<br>
As is clear from the description given so far, since the divided heat shielding plates 241, 242, 243, 243 are employed, each heat shielding plate 241, 242, 243, 243 can be mounted freely on the vehicle body frame 110 after the fuel tank 230 is mounted on the vehicle body frame 110 (vehicle body), and thus the efficiency of mounting operation is ensured.<br>
[0049]<br>

As is described thus far, since the upper portions of the left and right heat shielding plates 243, 243 must simply be hooked on the vehicle body frame 110, it can be mounted in a very simple manner.<br><br><br>
[0055]<br>
Fig. 11 is a drawing showing an action of the radiator and the parts therearound of the motorcycle according to the present invention. A fan 224 located behind the radiator 221 introduces air from the front of the radiator 221. Therefore, the outside air is introduced into the cooling air induction ports 93a...for the radiator as cooling air (including air blowing on the vehicle during travel) Fc, and flows through the cooling air passage into the radiator 221. [0056]<br>
Hot air coming out from the radiator 221 (exhausted hot air) Fh is discharged through the fan 224, guided by the front heat shielding plate 241, which also serves as a cooling air guide, to change the flow into downward direction, and discharged from the air discharge port 94a of the under cover 94 toward the outside.<br>
Since the direction of hot air Fh coming out from the radiator 221 is changed by the front heat shielding plate 241, the effect of hot air Fh on the engine 211 or the fuel tank 230 located behind the radiator 221 can be prevented. Since the front heat shielding plate 241 also serves as a cooling air guide, provision of a separate cooling air guide is not necessary.<br>

When the lower portion of the driving member 447 is pulled by the second cable 412, the jaw 455 of the driving member 447 presses the lower claw 452 of the locking claw 445 downward, and thus the locking claw 445 rotates toward the locking position (counterclockwise).<br>
[0076]<br>
A plurality of aforementioned sub-locking mechanisms 405 may be provided, and in such a case, the driving members 447 of the respective sub-locking mechanisms 405 are connected by cables, or the locking claw 424 (See Fig. 17) of the main locking mechanism 404 (See Fig. 17) and the driving members 447 of the respective sub-locking mechanisms 405 are connected by cables respectively.<br>
[0077]<br>
Operation of the seat attachment structure described thus far will be described below.<br>
Figs. 19 (a) to (c) are first explanatory drawings illustrating the operation of the seat attachment structure of the motorcycle according to the present invention, in which<br><br><br>
(a) is a side view of the seat 208, (b) is a diagrammatic sketch illustrating the balance of moment acting on the seat according to this embodiment, and (c) is a diagrammatic sketch illustrating the balance of moment of the comparative example.<br>
In (a), an axis of opening and closing movement of the seat hinge 401 is represented by 401a, the horizontal distance from the shaft 401a to the second seat hook 415 of the sub-locking mechanism is represented by LI, and the horizontal distance from the shaft 4 01a to the first seat hook 414 of the main locking mechanism is represented by L3 . The center point in the horizontal length of the seal rubber 417 abutted against the edge of the opening of the storage box 207 is represented by 460, and the horizontal distance between the center point 460 and the aforementioned shaft 401a is represented by L2.<br>
[0078]<br>
In (b) and (c), each of the shaft 401a, the first and second seat hooks 414, 415, and the center point 460 of seal rubber 417 is illustrated by a point for the sake of convenience.<br>
In (b), the main locking mechanism 404 and the sub-locking mechanism 405 are shown in rectangular, and a downward pressing force required for locking the main locking mechanism 404 and the sub-locking mechanism 405 by pressing the rear end portion of the seat above the main locking mechanism 404 downward is represented by Fl, a reaction force of the locking<br><br><br>
claw exerted on the first seat hook 414 upward by the locking claw of the main locking mechanism 404 when locked is represented by RN, and a reaction force of seal rubber 417 bent by being abutted against the edge of the storage box 207 is represented by RR. Though the reaction force of rubber RR is a distributed load, it is considered to be a load acting on the center point 460 for the purpose of illustration. Though the seat is exerted with a downward force by its own weight and with an upward force by the damper, its own weight is almost cancelled by the force exerted by the damper, and thus the forces exerted by its own weight and by the damper are not described here. This is also applied to the comparative example described below.<br>
[0079]<br>
The comparative example (c) is an example of the seat lock mechanism in which the main locking mechanism 501 is disposed below the central portion of the seat 208, and the sub-locking mechanism 502 is disposed below the rear end portion of the seat 208, so that when the main locking mechanism 501 at the center is locked, the sub-locking mechanism 502 at the rear end is simultaneously locked. The main locking mechanism 501 and the sub-locking mechanism 502 are shown in rectangular.<br>
When such a seat locking mechanism is locked by pressing the center portion of the seat above the main locking mechanism<br><br><br>
501 downward, a downward pressing force required for locking is F2, the reaction force of the locking claw of the main locking mechanism 501 at the moment of locking is RN which is the same as that in (b), the reaction force of rubber is RR as that in (b).<br>
[0080]<br>
The balance of moment about the seat hinge shaft 401a in this embodiment shown in the aforementioned (b), and the balance of moment about the seat hinge shaft in the comparative example in (c) will be as shown in [Equations 1]<br>
[0081] [Equations 1]<br>
Balance of moment about the seat hinge shaft<br>
This embodiment<br>
Fl x L3 = RR x L2 + RN x L3	(1)<br>
Comparative example<br>
F2 x LI = RR x L2 + RN x Ll	(2)<br>
From equation (1)<br>
(Fl-RN) x L3 = RR x L2	(3)<br>
From equation (2)<br>
(F2 - RN) x Ll = RR x L2	(4)<br>
From equations (3) and (4)<br>
(Fl - RN) x L3 = (F2 - RN) x Ll—(5)<br>
When both sides of the equation (5) are divided by L3,<br>
(Fl - RN) = L1/L3 x (F2 - RN)	(6)<br><br><br>
Since L3 
(Fl - RN) 
Therefore:<br>
Fl 
[0082]<br>
From the equation (7) of [Equations 1] above, the downward pressing force of the seat Fl in this embodiment is smaller than the downward pressing force of the seat F2 in the comparative example. The operating force for locking the seat may be reduced according to the present invention.<br>
[0083]<br>
Figs. 20(a), (b) are second explanatory drawings illustrating the operation of the seat attachment structure of the motorcycle according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), when the seat is pressed downward by hand in order to close the seat, the first seat hook 414 attached at the lower portion of the seat moves downward as illustrated by the arrow a and abuts against the lower claw 432 of the locking claw 424 of the main locking mechanism 404. Then, as shown in (b), when the first seat hook 414 moves further downward as illustrated by the arrow b, the downward movement of the lower claw 432 of the main locking mechanism 404 as illustrated by the arrow c makes the locking claw 424 rotate about the pin 423 as illustrated by the arrow d, and the lower projection 437 of the locking claw 424 abuts against the projected portion 436<br><br><br>
of the stopper member 426. Accordingly, the lower arm portion 433 of the locking claw 424 pulls the second cable 412 as illustrated by the arrow e.<br>
[0084]<br>
When the second cable 412 is pulled, the second cable attaching point 456 of the driving member 447 of the sub-locking mechanism 405 is pulled in the direction illustrated by the arrow f, and the driving member 447 rotates as illustrated by the arrow g. Then the jaw 455 of the driving member 447 presses the lower claw 452 of the locking claw 445 downward, thereby rotating the locking claw 445 in the direction illustrated by the arrow h.<br>
At this moment, the second seat hook 415 provided at the lower portion of the seat moves downward in almost the same manner as the first seat hook 414 as illustrated by the arrow<br>
J-<br>
[0085]<br>
Figs. 21 (a), (b) are third explanatory drawings illustrating the operation of the seat attachment structure of the motorcycle according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), when the first seat hook 414 is moved further downward from the state shown in Fig. 20(b) as illustrated by the arrow m, the locking claw 424 of the main locking mechanism 404 further rotates as illustrated by the arrow n, and the lower projection 437 of the locking claw 424 moves over the projecting<br><br><br>
portion 436 of the stopper member 426. At this moment, the stopper member 426 rotates about the pin 425 as illustrated by the arrow p. Simultaneously, the lower arm portion 433 further pulls the second cable 412 as illustrated by the arrow g with the rotation of the locking claw 424.<br>
[0086]<br>
When the second cable 412 is pulled, the second cable attaching point 456 of the driving member 447 of the sub-locking mechanism 405 is pulled as illustrated by the arrow r, and the driving member 447 further rotates as illustrated by the arrow s. Then, the jaw 455 of the driving member 447 further presses the lower claw 452 of the locking claw 445 downward, thereby rotating the locking claw 445 as illustrated by the arrow t.<br>
At this moment, the second seat hook 415 provided at the lower portion of the seat moves downward in almost the same manner as the first seat hook 414 as illustrated by the arrow u.<br>
[0087]<br>
In (b), after the lower projection 437 of the locking claw 424 of the main locking mechanism 404 moves over the projecting portion 436 of the stopper member 426, the stopper member 426 rotates as illustrated by the arrow v by the tensile force of the tension coil spring 427, and the inclined portion 436a of the stopper member 426 abuts against the lower projection 437 of the locking claw 424.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the inclined portion 436a of the stopper member 426 serves as a stopper and restrains the clockwise rotation of the locking claw 424. in other words, in the main locking mechanism 404, the locking claw 424 is brought into the locked state in which the locking claw 424 engages the first seat hook 414.<br>
[0088]<br>
At this moment, since the second cable 412 connected to the driving member 447 is maintained in the pulled state in the sub-locking mechanism 405, the driving member 447 restrains the locking claw 445 from rotating clockwise. In other words, the locking claw 445 is brought into the locked state in which it engages the second seat hook 415.<br>
[0089]<br>
The locked state both between the first seat hook 414 and the main locking mechanism 404 and between the second seat hook 415 and the sub locking mechanism 405 may be released, in Fig. 15, by inserting the key 407 into the keyhole 406 of the seat lock 265, rotating the same, and rotating the arm portion 408.<br>
[0090]<br>
Consequently, as shown in Fig. 21(b), the first cable 411 is pulled and the stopper member 426 rotates in the direction opposite from the direction illustrated by the arrow v,  and the projecting portion 436 of the stopper member 426<br><br>
moved downward to move over the lower projection 437 of the locking claw 424 into the state shown in Fig. 21(a). Therefore, the locking claw 424 rotates in the direction opposite from the direction illustrated by the arrow n by a tensile force of the tension coil spring 427, and the first seat hook 414 is released from the upper claw 431 of the locking claw 424.<br>
As a consequent, the first seat hook 414 and the main locking mechanism 404 do not engage with each other and thus are brought into a released state.<br>
[0091]<br>
In Fig. 21(a), the second cable 412 is pulled in the direction opposite from the direction illustrated by the arrow q because of the rotation of the aforementioned locking claw 424 in the opposite direction from the direction illustrated by the arrow n and of a tensile force of the tension coil spring 448 of the sub-locking mechanism 405.  Consequently, the driving member 447 of the sub-locking mechanism 405 rotates in the direction opposite from the direction illustrated by the arrow s,  and the locking claw 445 rotates in the direction opposite from the direction illustrated by the arrow t with the lower claw 452 of the locking claw 445 abutting against the jaw 455 in association with elevation of the jaw 455, so that the second seat hook 415 is released from the upper claw 451 of the locking claw 445.<br>
As a consequent, the second seat hook 415 and the<br><br>
sub-locking mechanism 405 do not engage with each other and thus are brought into unlocked state.<br>
[0092]<br>
As is described thus far in conjunction with Fig. 3, Fig. 16 and Fig. 19, the present invention is; in a motorcycle 10 wherein an opening 207c of the storage box 207 for storing a helmet Hf, Hr or the like is closed by a seat 208 which is elongated in the fore-and-aft direction and being attached with a seat hinge 401 so as to be opened and closed freely, a first and second seat hooks 414, 415 are attached on the seat bottom plate 208d of the seat 208, and a main locking mechanism 404 and sub-locking mechanism 405 are attached on the vehicle body frame 110 for being engaged respectively with the first and second seat hooks 414, 415 respectively, so that the seat is locked by the main and sub- locking mechanisms 404, 405, a seat attachment structure for scooter type vehicles being characterized in that the seat hinge 401 is attached at one end of the seat 208, the first seat hook 414 is attached at the other end of the seat 208, the second seat hook 415 is attached substantially at the center of the seat 208, the main locking mechanism 404 and the sub-locking mechanism 405 are connected by a second cable 412, so that when the main locking mechanism 404 is locked by the external force, the sub-locking mechanism 405 is also brought into the locked state in conjunction therewith.<br>
4-6-9°<br><br>
[0093]<br>
When locking the main locking mechanism 404, the sub-locking mechanism 405 may also be brought into the locked state in conjunction therewith. Therefore, the locking operation of the main and sub- locking mechanisms 404, 405 may be performed easily as a job lot. As a consequent, the requirement of some getting used to the operation of the seat as in the case of the related art in which a plurality of locking mechanisms are provided at a plurality of locations is not required in this invention, and the seat 208 can be locked easily and reliably.<br>
[0094]<br>
By providing the first seat hook 414 at the other end of the seat 208, the first seat hook 414 may be positioned at the farthest point form the seat hinge 401 attached at one end of the seat 208 and thus the distance L3 between the seat hinge 401 and the first seat hook 414 may be maximized. Therefore, when locking the main locking mechanism 404 by pressing the end of the seat 208 above the main locking mechanism 404 downward by hand, a downward pressing force Fl required to be exerted on the seat 208 for generating a moment about the sea hinge 401 may be reduced.<br>
[0095]<br>
For example, the present invention employs a stracture wherein the seat hook for the main locking mechanism is attached<br><br><br>
at the center of the seat, and the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached at the other end of the seat. And, according to the present invention, only a smaller downward pressing force Fl is required for moving the seat 208 downward in comparison with the case in which the central portion of the seat is pressed downward by the downward pressing force F2 when closing the seat.<br>
In this way, according to the seat locking mechanism 402 in the seat attachment structure of the present invention, the seat 208 can be reliably locked by a small operating force.<br>
As is described in conjunction with Fig. 15, even with the damper 416 attached on the seat 208, the seat 208 can be reliably locked with a smaller operating force than the case of the related art.<br>
[0096]<br>
Secondly, the present invention is characterized in that the first and second seat hooks 414, 415 are formed into angular U-shape having straight portions 414a, 415a along the length of the seat 208 so that the straight portions 414a, 415a may be engaged with the main and sub- locking mechanisms 404, 405 respectively.<br>
[0097]<br>
The dimensional errors of the first and second seat hooks 414, 415, the main locking mechanism 404, and the sub-locking mechanism 405, the errors in attachment of these members, or<br><br><br>
the positional errors of engagement between the first and second seat hooks 414, 4115 and the main and sub- locking mechanisms 404, 405 due to rigidity of the seat 208 may be absorbed by the length of the straight portions of the first and second seat hooks 414, 415, and thus the main and sub-locking mechanisms 404, 405 may be locked reliably without the influence of the aforementioned errors.<br>
[0098]<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the seat hinge is attached at the front end of the seat, the seat hook for the main locking mechanism is attached at the rear end of the seat, and the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached substantially at the center of the seat. However, it is not limited thereto, and it is also possible to attach the seat hinge at the rear end of the seat, to attach the seat hook for the main locking mechanism at the front end of the seat, and to attach the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism substantially at the center of the seat.<br>
[0099] [Advantages]<br>
The present invention with the aforementioned construction will provide the following advantages.<br>
in the seat attachment structure for scooter type vehicles according to Claim 1, since the hinge is attached at one end of the seat, the seat hook for the main locking mechanism<br><br><br>
is attached at the other end of the seat, the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached substantially at the center of the seat, and the main locking mechanism and the sub-locking mechanism are connected by a connecting member such as a wire or the like, sub-locking mechanism may also be brought into the locked state in conjunction therewith when locking the main locking mechanism. Therefore, the locking operation of the main and sub- locking mechanisms may be performed easily as a job lot. As a consequent, the requirement of some getting used to the operation of the seat as in the case of the related art in which a plurality of locking mechanisms are provided at a plurality of locations is not required in this invention, and the seat can be locked easily and reliably.<br>
[0100]<br>
By providing a seat hook for the main locking mechanism at the other end of the seat, the seat hook for the main locking mechanism may be positioned at the farthest point form the hinge attached at one end of the seat. Therefore, when locking the main locking mechanism by pressing the end of the seat above the main locking mechanism downward by hand, a downward pressing force required to be exerted on the seat for generating a moment about the hinge may be reduced. For example, according to the present invention, only a smaller operating force is required for locking the seat in comparison with the case in which the seat hook for the main locking mechanism is<br><br><br>
attached at the center of the seat and the seat hook for the sub-locking mechanism is attached at the other end of the seat so that the seat is closed by pressing the central portion of the seat downward.<br>
[0101]<br>
In the seat attachment structure for scooter type<br>
vehicles according to Claim 2, since the seat hook is formed<br>
into an angular U-shape having a straight portion along the<br>
length of the seat so that the straight portion is engaged with<br>
each of the main and sub-locking mechanisms, the dimensional<br>
errors of the seat hook, the main locking mechanism, and the<br>
sub locking mechanism, the errors in attachment of these<br>
members, or the positional errors of engagement between the<br>
seat hook and each locking mechanism due to rigidity of the<br>
seat may be absorbed by the length of the straight portion of<br>
the-seat hook, and thus the main and sub- locking mechanisms<br>
may be locked reliably without the influence of the<br>
aforementioned errors.<br>
