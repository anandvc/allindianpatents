				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to transformers used for voltage<br>
transformation, and more particularly to a method for forming a winding for three phase transformes.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Three-phase transformers typically include a magnetic core, and three sets of<br>
high and low-voltage windings (coils). Each set of high and low-voltage windings is<br>
mounted on a respective winding leg of the core.<br>
The windings are typically formed by winding an electrical conductor, such as<br>
copper or aluminum wire, on a continuous basis. The electrical conductor can be<br>
wound around a mandrel or directly onto an associated winding leg of the<br>
transformer. The electrical conductor is wound into a plurality of turns in side by side<br>
relationship to form a first layer of turns. A first layer of insulating material is<br><br>
subsequently placed around the first layer of turns. The electrical conductor is wound<br>
into a second plurality of turns over the fiist layer of insulating material, thereby<br>
forming a second layerof turns.<br>
A second layer of insulating material is subsequently placed over the second<br>
layer of turns. The electrical conductor is then wound into a third plurality of turns<br>
over fee second layer of insulation, thereby formiag a third layer or turns. The above<br>
procedures can be repeated until a predetermined number of turn layers have been<br>
formed.<br>
The insulating material is typically formed as a sheet or a continuous strip.<br>
The insulating material usually includes end fill, i.e., filling material bonded or<br>
otherwise secured to opposing sides of the sheet or strip. For example, Figure 8<br>
depicts a portion of a transformer winding 99 formed using conventional techniques.<br>
The transformer winding 99 comprises sheets of insulating material 100 that each<br>
include end fill 101, and an electrical conductor 106 wound in layers 108 each formed<br>
by a plurality of turns of the electrical conductor 106.<br>
End fill is believed to increase the short-circuit strength of the transformer<br>
winding, and can thereby decrease the potential for short-circuit failure. End fill can<br>
also inhibit the tendency for the outermost turns of each layer to separate from their<br>
adjacent turns and drop down from their respective underlying layers of turns. In<br>
other words, the end fill can have a restraining effect that counteracts the tendency of<br>
the outermost turns to move outwardly, away from the remaining turns in their<br>
respective layers.<br>
The use of end fill can add to the cost of the insulating material (and the<br>
overall cost of the transformer winding), can increase the space needed to store the<br>
insulating material, and can adversely affect manufacturability of the transformer<br><br>
winding, in comparison to windings formed with insulation that does not include end<br>
fill. Moreover, the use of end fill can make it difficult to automate the winding<br>
process. The use of insulation with end fill, until recently, was generally<br>
considered a necessity in three-phase transformers due to the relatively high kva<br>
ratings (SO kva and higher) associated with such transformers (high kva ratings<br>
generally necessitate high short-circuit strength). Also, the use of insulation with end<br>
fill is often considered necessary to inhibit the tendency of the outermost turns of the<br>
transformer winding to separate from their adjacent turns and drop down from their<br>
underlying layers, as discussed above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A preferred embodiment of a three-phase transformer comprises a first, a<br>
second, and a third winding leg, and a first, a second, and a third winding positioned<br>
around the respective first, second, and third winding legs. The first, second, and<br>
third windings each comprise an electrical conductor wound into a plurality of<br>
overlapping layers each formed by a plurality of adjacent turns of the electrical<br>
conductor, and an insulating material without end fill positioned between each of the<br>
overlapping layers. The electrical conductor has a transition portion formed therein<br>
between a first and a second of the overlapping layers. The transition portion is at<br>
least one of bent to form an offset in the electrical conductor, and secured to at least<br>
one of the plurality of adjacent turns.<br>
A preferred method for forming a transformer winding comprises winding an<br>
electrical conductor into a first plurality turns in side by side relationship to form a<br>
first layer of turns, covering at least a portion of the first layer of turns with a layer of<br>
insulating material without end fill, and winding the electrical conductor into a second<br>
plurality turns in side by side relationship to form a second layer of turns that overlies<br><br>
the first layer of turns and the layer of insulation. The preferred method also<br>
comprises at least one of bending the electrical conductor to form an offset in the<br>
electrical conductor at a transition in the electrical conductor between the first layer of<br>
turns and the second layer of turns, and securing the transition in the electrical<br>
conductor to at least one of the first plurality of turns. The electrical conductor is one<br>
of wound into the first and second pluralities of turns over a winding leg of a core of<br>
the three-phase transformer, and wound into the first and second pluralities of turns<br>
over a mandrel and subsequently installed on the winding leg.<br>
Another preferred method for forming a transformer winding comprises<br>
winding an electrical conductor into a first plurality turns in side by side relationship<br>
to form a first layer turns, and bending a first portion of the electrical conductor<br>
upwardly and laterally in relation to the first layer of turns so that a second portion of<br>
the electrical conductor immediately following the first portion of the electrical<br>
conductor overlies the first layer of turns. The preferred method also comprises<br>
subsequently winding the electrical conductor into a second plurality turns in side by<br>
side relationship to form a second layer of turns. The electrical conductor is one of<br>
wound into the first and second pluralities of turns over a winding leg of a core of the<br>
three-phase transformer, and wound into the first and second pluralities of turns over a<br>
mandrel and subsequently installed on the winding leg.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
A preferred embodiment of a three-phase transformer 100 is depicted in<br>
Figure 1. The transformer 100 comprises a conventional laminated core 102. The<br>
core 102 is formed from a suitable magnetic material such as textured silicon steel or<br>
an amorphous alloy. The core 102 comprises a first winding leg 104, a second<br>
winding leg 106, and a third winding leg 108. The core 102 also comprises an upper<br>
yoke 110 and a lower yoke 112. Opposing ends of each of the first, second, and third<br><br>
winding legs 104, 106, 108 are fixedly coupled to the upper and lower yokes 110, 112<br>
using, for example, a suitable adhesive.<br>
A primary winding 10 is positioned around each of the first, second, and third<br>
winding legs 104, 106, 108. A secondary winding 11 is likewise positioned around<br>
each of the first, second, and third winding legs 104, 106, 108. The primary windings<br>
10 can be electrically connected in a "Delta" configuration, as is commonly known<br>
among those skilled in the art of transformer manufacturing and design. The<br>
secondary windings 11 can be electrically connected in a "Delta" or a "Wye"<br>
configuration, depending on the voltage requirements of the transformer 100. (The<br>
electrical connections between the primary and secondary windings 10, 11 are not<br>
shown in Figure 1, for clarity.)<br>
The primary windings 10 can be electrically coupled to a three-phase power<br>
source (not shown). The secondary windings 11 can be electrically coupled to a load<br>
(also not shown). The primary and secondary windings 10, 11 are inductively<br>
coupled via the core 102 when the primary windings 10 are energized by the load.<br>
More particularly, the alternative voltage across the primary windings 10 sets up an<br>
alternating magnetic flux in the core 102. The magnetic flux induces an alternating<br>
voltage across the secondary windings 11 (and the load connected thereto).<br>
A description of additional structural elements and functional details of the<br>
transformer 10 is not necessary to an understanding of the present invention, and<br>
therefore is not presented herein.<br>
A description of a preferred method for forming one of the primary windings<br>
10 follows (the preferred method is equally applicable to the secondary windings 11).<br>
The primary winding 10 is depicted herein a being cylindrical. The preferred method<br><br>
can also be applied to windings formed in other shapes, such as round, rectangular,<br>
rectangular with curved sides, oval, etc.<br>
The primary winding 10 is described as being wound directly onto the winding<br>
leg 104 of the transformer 100 (see Figure 2). The preferred method can also be used<br>
to form the primary winding 10 on a mandrel for subsequent installation on the<br>
winding leg 104. The preferred method can also be applied to non-concentric primary<br>
and secondary windings.<br>
The primary winding 10 comprises an electrical conductor 16 wound around<br>
the winding leg 104 on a continuous basis (see Figure 2). The electrical conductor 16<br>
can be, for example, rectangular, round, or flattened-round aluminum or copper wire.<br>
(Other types of electrical conductors, including electrical conductors having non-<br>
circular cross sections, can be used in the alternative). The primary winding 10 also<br>
comprises face-width sheet layer insulation. More particularly, the primary winding<br>
10 comprises sheets of insulation 18 (see Figures 2, 3, and 5). The sheets of<br>
insulation 18 can be formed from heat-curable epoxy diamond pattern coated kraft<br>
paper (commonly referred to as "DPP paper"). It should be noted that other types of<br>
insulation, such as heat-curable epoxy fully coated kraft paper or coated crepe paper,<br>
can be used in the alternative. The sheets of insulation 18 do not include end fill.<br>
The primary winding 10 comprises overlapping layers of turns of the electrical<br>
conductor 16. A respective one of the sheets of insulation 18 is positioned between<br>
each of the overlapping layers of turns (see Figure 5). The turns in each layer<br>
advance progressively across the width of the primary winding 10. In other words,<br>
each overlapping layer of the primary winding 10 is formed by winding the electrical<br>
conductor 16 in a plurality of turns arranged in a side by side relationship across the<br>
width of the primary winding 10.<br><br>
The primary winding 10 is formed by placing one of the sheets of insulation<br>
18 on an outer surface of the first winding leg 104 so that the sheet of insulation 18<br>
covers a portion of the outer surface.<br>
A first layer of turns 20 is subsequently wound onto the winding leg 104.<br>
More particularly, the electrical conductor 16 is wound around the outer surface of the<br>
winding leg 104 and over the sheet of insulation 18, until a predetermined number of<br>
adjacent (side by side) turns have been formed.<br>
A transition from the first layer of turns 20 to an overlying second layer of<br>
turns 22 can be formed by bending the electrical conductor 16. More particularly, an<br>
offset or bend 24 can be placed in the electrical conductor 16 at the end of the first<br>
layer of turns 20, i.e., in the portion of the electrical conductor 16 that transitions, or<br>
crosses over from the first layer of turns 20 to the second layer of turns 22 (see<br>
Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7; the sheets of insulation 18 are not shown in Figure 4, for<br>
clarity). (The term "bending," as used in this context throughout the specification and<br>
claims, means permanently (non-resiliently) deforming the electrical conductor 16.)<br>
The bend 24 extends upwardly, i.e., away from the underlying surface of the<br>
first winding leg 104 (see Figure 4). The bend 24 also extends laterally in relation to<br>
the first layer of turns 20, i.e., in a direction coinciding with the longitudinal axis of<br>
the first winding leg 104 (see Figure 3). The bend 24 thus causes the subsequent<br>
portion of the electrical conductor 16 to be positioned above the first layer of turns 20.<br>
The use of the bend 24 to transition the electrical conductor 16 from the first layer of<br>
turns 20 to the second layer of turns 22 is believed to lessen the potential for the<br>
outermost turns of the second layer of turns 22 proximate the bend 24 to separate<br>
from their adjacent turns and drop down from their position above the first layer of<br>
■turns 20.<br><br>
(Lessening the potential for the outermost turns of the primary winding 10 to<br>
separate from their adjacent turns, as explained below, can facilitate the use of<br>
insulation without end fill.)<br>
It should be noted that the angle at which the electrical conductor 16 is bent to<br>
form the bend 24 depends on factors such as the diameter of the electrical conductor<br>
16, the overall size of the primary winding 10, the circumferential location of the bend<br>
24 on the primary winding 10 (which in turn can depend on the shape of the primary<br>
winding 10), etc. A specific value for this angle therefore is not specified herein.<br>
A suitable adhesive, such as hot melt adhesive, can be applied to the portion of<br>
the electrical conductor 16 that transitions between the first layer of turns 20 and the<br>
second layer or turns 22. More particularly, the adhesive can be applied to the bend<br>
24, and to the portion of the electrical conductor 16 immediately preceding and<br>
immediately following the bend 24. The adhesive can also be applied to the portion<br>
of the first layer of turns 20 adjacent the bend 24. The adhesive, upon drying, forms a<br>
mechanical joint 26 that can secure the bend 24 to the adjacent portion of the first<br>
layer of turns 20 (the joint 26 is shown in Figure 6 only, for clarity). The joint 26 is<br>
believed to lessen the potential for the outermost turns of the second layer of turns 22<br>
proximate the bend 24 to separate from their adjacent turns.<br>
It should be noted that the technique of applying adhesive to the portion of the<br>
electrical conductor 16 that transitions between the first layer of turns 20 and the<br>
second layer of turns 22 can be used in alternative versions of the preferred method in<br>
which the bend 24 is not formed in the electrical conductor 16.<br>
The second layer of turns 22 is formed after the transition from the first to the<br>
second layers 20, 22 has been formed in the above-described manner. In particular,<br>
another of the sheets of insulation 18 is secured in place over the first layer of turns 20<br><br>
so that an edge of the sheet of insulation 18 is located proximate the bend 24, and<br>
extends across the first layer of turns 20 (see Figure 3).<br>
The electrical conductor 16 is subsequently wound over the first layer of turns<br>
20 and the overlying sheet of insulation 18 to form the second layer of turns 22, in the<br>
manner described above in relation to the first layer of turns 20. In other words, the<br>
second layer of turns 22 is formed by winding the electrical conductor 16 into a series<br>
of adjacent turns progressing back across the first layer of turns 20, until a<br>
predetermined turns count is reached.<br>
A transition between the second layer of turns 22 and an overlying third layer<br>
of turns 23 is formed after the second layer of turns 22 has been wound, in the manner<br>
described above in relation to the transition between the first and second layers 20,22.<br>
Another of the sheets of insulation 18 is subsequently positioned around the second<br>
layer of turns 22. The electrical conductor 16 is then wound into a series of adjacent<br>
turns progressing across the width of the sheet of insulation 18 and the second layer of<br>
turns 22, thereby forming the third layer of turns 23.<br>
The above procedures can be repeated until a desired number of layers have<br>
been formed in the primary winding 10 (only three of the layers of turns are depicted<br>
in Figure 5, for clarity). The adhesive on the sheets of insulation 18 can subsequently<br>
be melted and cured using conventional techniques such as heating the primary<br>
winding 10 in a convection oven.<br>
A conventional automated winding machine be programmed to perform the<br>
above-described bending and gluing operations. For example, the above-described<br>
method has been preformed on an experimental basis using a model AM 3175 layer<br>
winding machine available from BR Technologies GmbH.<br><br>
It may be necessary to flatten the electrical conductor 16 prior to the winding<br>
process. This action may be required in applications where the diameter of the<br>
electrical conductor 16 is greater than approximately 0.7 mm. Flattening the electrical<br>
conductor 16 is believed to further inhibit the potential for the outermost turns to<br>
separate from their adjacent turns. (The electrical conductor 16 can be flattened using<br>
conventional techniques commonly known to those skilled in the art of transformer<br>
design and manufacture.)<br>
It should be noted that a continuous strip of insulating material (not shown)<br>
can be used in lieu of the sheets of insulation 18. In particular, the continuous strip of<br>
insulating material can be continuously wound ahead of the electrical conductor 16 to<br>
provide substantially the same insulating properties as the sheets of insulation 18.<br>
The insulating strip can be positioned around a particular layer of the primary winding<br>
10, and then cut to an appropriate length at the end of the layer using conventional<br>
techniques commonly known to those skilled in the art of transformer design and<br>
manufacture.<br>
Alternative versions of the preferred method can include the technique of<br>
lugging. In particular, the portions of the electrical conductor 16 that transition<br>
between the various layers of the primary winding 10 can be tied to their adjacent<br>
turns, or their adjacent series of turns, using a ribbon 29 (or a string, cord, line, etc.) in<br>
a manner commonly known to those skilled in the art of transformer design and<br>
manufacture (see Figure 7). Tying (lugging) the electrical conductor 16 in this<br>
manner is believed to reduce the potential for the outermost turns of the primary<br>
winding 10 to separate from their adjacent turns.<br>
One of the primary uses for end fill on the insulation of a three-phase<br>
transformer winding, such as the primary winding 10, is preventing or inhibiting the<br><br>
outermost turns of the transformer winding from separating from their adjacent turns.<br>
Hence, the above-noted techniques for reducing the potential for the outermost turns<br>
of the primary winding 10 to separate from their adjacent turns can, under certain<br>
circumstances, facilitate the use of insulation without end fill in a three-phase<br>
transformer. (Although the above-noted techniques have previously been applied to<br>
windings for use in single-phase transformers, it is believed that the techniques, until<br>
this point, have not been applied to windings for use in three-phase transformers.)<br>
Moreover, it is currently understood among those skilled in the art of<br>
transformer design that adequate short-circuit strength can be obtained in most three-<br>
phase transformers without the need for end fill, provided the adhesive on the<br>
insulation used in the transformer is properly bonded. Hence, the use of the above-<br>
noted techniques can potentially eliminate the additional expense, and the additional<br>
storage and manufacturing difficulties sometimes associated with the use of end fill.<br>
Different combinations of the above-noted techniques, it is believed, can<br>
facilitate the use of insulation without end fill in a three-phase transformer winding<br>
such as the primary winding 10. The proper combination of techniques required to<br>
achieve this result depends, at least in part, on the diameter of the electrical conductor<br>
16.<br>
The use of adhesive to form mechanical joints where the electrical conductor<br>
16 transitions between the various layers of the primary winding 10 is believed to be<br>
sufficient, by itself, to allow the use of insulation without end fill, where the diameter<br>
of the electrical conductor 16 is less than approximately 1.8 mm. In applications<br>
where the diameter of the electrical conductor 16 exceeds approximately 1.8 mm, this<br>
technique may need to be supplemented with the technique of forming a bend, such as<br><br>
the bend 24, where the electrical conductor 16 transitions between the various layers<br>
of the primary winding 10.<br>
The use of lugging is believed to be sufficient, by itself, to allow the use of<br>
insulation without end fill regardless of the diameter of the electrical conductor 16. It<br>
should be noted, however, each of the above-noted techniques can be supplemented<br>
with one or both of the other techniques, regardless of the diameter of the electrical<br>
conductor 16, to provide additional protection against the outermost turns of the<br>
primary winding 10 dropping off their underlying layers.<br>
(It may be necessary to flatten the electrical conductor 16 in applications<br>
where the diameter of the electrical conductor 16 is greater than approximately 0.7<br>
mm, as discussed above. This requirement is believed to apply regardless of the<br>
combination of the other techniques used to prevent the outermost turns of the<br>
primary winding 10 from dropping off their underlying turns.)<br>
The above-described process can be repeated to form the other primary<br>
windings 10, and the secondary windings 11.<br>
It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and<br>
advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description,<br>
together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for forming a winding for a three-phase transformer (100),<br>
comprising:<br>
winding an electrical conductor (16) over a surface of a structure (104,<br>
106, 108) to form a first layer of turns (20), said structure having<br>
opposing end portions and said turns being serially arranged in a<br>
direction extending between the opposing end portions;<br>
covering at least a portion of the first layer of turns with a layer of<br>
insulating material (18) without end fill;<br>
winding the electrical conductor into a second layer of turns (22) that<br>
overlies the first layer of turns and the layer of insulation;<br>
characterized in bending the electrical conductor away from the<br>
surface of the structure and toward one of the end portions of the<br>
structure to form a transition between the first and second layers.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising securing the transition<br>
to at least one of the turns in the first layer of turns (20).<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein securing the transition to at<br>
least one of the turns in the first layer of turns (120) comprises<br><br>
adhesively bonding the transition to at least one of the turns in the<br>
first layer of turns.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein securing the transition to at<br>
least one of the turns in the first layer of turns (20) comprises tying<br>
the transition to at least one of the turns in the first layer of turns.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the bending of the<br>
electrical conductor is performed at a first one of the end portions and<br>
the electrical conductor is bent toward a second one of the end<br>
portions.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising flattening the electrical<br>
conductor (16) before the step of winding the electrical conductor to<br>
form the first layer of turns (20).<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the insulating material (18)<br>
comprises a sheet of insulating material.<br><br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the insulating material (18)<br>
comprises a strip of insulating material, and wherein the step of<br>
covering at least a portion of the first layer of turns (20) with the layer<br>
of insulating material (18) comprises winding the strip of insulating<br>
material over the first layer of turns such that the layer of insulating<br>
material comprises a plurality of turns of the strip of insulating<br>
material.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the bending of the<br>
electrical conductor forms an offset between an ending portion of the<br>
first layer of turns (20) and a beginning portion of the second layer of<br>
turns (22), said offset being in a direction parallel to a longitudinal axis<br>
of the structure and in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the structure.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the structure is a winding<br>
leg (104, 106, 108).<br><br>
11. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the structure is a mandrel.<br><br>
A method for forming a winding for a three-phase transformer (100), comprising:<br>
winding an electrical conductor (16) over a surface of a structure (104,106,108)<br>
to form a first layer of turns (20), said structure having opposing end portions<br>
and said turns being serially arranged in a direction extending between the<br>
opposing end portions; covering at least a portion of the first layer of turns with<br>
a layer of insulating material (18) without end fill; winding the electrical<br>
conductor into a second layer of turns (22) that overlies the first layer of turns<br>
and the layer of insulation; characterized in bending the electrical conductor<br>
away from the surface of the structure and toward one of the end portions of the<br>
structure to form a transition between the first and second layers.</td>
