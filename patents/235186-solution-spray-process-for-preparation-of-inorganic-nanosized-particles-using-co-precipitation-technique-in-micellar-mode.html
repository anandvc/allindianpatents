TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
SOLUTION SPRAY PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF INORGANIC NANOPARTICLES USING CO-PRECIPITATION TECHNIQUE IN MICELLAR MODE<br>
APPLICANT<br>
NORTH MAHARASHTRA UNIVERSITY, JALGAON<br><br>
SOLUTION SPRAY PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF INORGANIC NANOPARTICLES USING CO-PRECIPITATION TECHNIQUE IN MICELLAR MODE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a simple solution process performed in low viscosity medium for the rapid preparation and easy recovery of highly dispersed nanoparticles with controlled sizes in the range of 5 to 80 nanometers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nanoparticles are a new class of colloidal materials available in nano size (
In the present invention, surfactant is added to the precursor for subsequent control of size during formation of nanosized particles. The concentration of the surfactant is required to be greater than the 'Critical Micelle Concentration' (CMC) so as to promote synthesis in micellar mode. The precipitator and precursor are sprayed in the form of fine droplets. These atomized droplets get reacted within micelles and hence the growth of the nano sized product is initiated at a number of sites in semi batch mode. In this way, coagulation of two or more crystals is inhibited and product is retained in nano form.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most of the unique properties of nanoparticles require not only the particles to be of nanosize but also the particles to be dispersed without agglomeration. Inorganic<br><br>
nanoparticles have a common tendency of agglomeration and need a technique for control of size. How to synthesize uniform nanoparticles with narrow size distribution has been one of the key problems in the area of nanoscience and technology. Accordingly, the main object of the present invention is to develop a simple and rapid process for the preparation of highly dispersed nanoparticles having sizes smaller than 80 nm and with rigid control on particle size distribution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basis of solution spray process for synthesis of nanoparticles is to control reaction at molecular level (bottom to top approach) for regulating particle size. The idea is to spray reactants using fine nozzles and contact them at highly atomized level in film regime in presence of surfactant micelles to form the product nanoparticles rapidly and prevent the resultant product from meeting each other to avoid aggregation. Modern surfactant and colloid chemistry as well as chemical kinetics have thus been largely utilized to control size and morphology at the nanometer level.<br>
To meet the above objects and to overcome the problems existing in the prior art, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of highly dispersed nanoparticles varying from 5 to 80 nm as described herein, said process comprising:<br>
1.	Dissolving the precursor and precipitator independently in solvent to form concentrated solutions at specified strength.<br>
2.	Mixing the appropriate surfactant either with precursor or precipitator.<br>
3.	Spraying   these   solutions   independently   and   simultaneously   in   co-precipitation reactor to form the reaction zone in flowing thin film form.<br>
4.	Controlling the individual spray to maintain fan pattern in flowing reaction film.<br>
5.	Controlling  input flow  rates and  discharge  rates for providing  specific residence time/ holding time.<br>
6.	Filtering the resultant reaction mixture, containing nanosized product, through fine mesh filter.<br>
7.	Washing with solvent to remove soluble by-products (Salt) formed during the reaction.<br>
8.	Low temperature vacuum drying of nanoparticles to eliminate residual traces of solvent.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 relates to a design of Contactor/ Reactor particularly to a Reaction Vessel equipped with turbine impeller (06) with speed regulator (09) for uniform mixing, atomizer (14) for fine spray, energy regulator network for temperature control (05), pressure gauge (15), vent valve (16), entrainment separator (10), safety attachment-rupture disc (18) and sight glass (17) for visual observation of progress of reaction. The system was thus designed for intimate contacting of precursor and precipitator.<br>
Fig. 2 relates to TEM analysis of nano CaC03 showing the actual size of nano particles of CaC03 with the particle size varying between 10 - 40 nm, the maximum number of particles being of approximately 20 nm.<br>
Fig. 3 relates to XRD analysis of nano CaC03.<br>
Fig. 4 relates to the mechanism of stabilization of dispersed nanoparticles through entropic or electrical double layer interaction between Surfactant Micelles and Nanoparticles.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO EXAMPLES AND DRAWING<br>
According to figure 1, the separately prepared solutions of precursor (PC) and precipitator (PP) are sprayed through the individual nozzles of atomizers by reciprocating compressor (01) at controlled pressure and flow rate. Formation of falling film reaction regime (3) of atomized reactants between impeller and atomizer is the key to success of co-precipitation reaction at molecular scale. A turbine agitator (06) rotating at a speed between 75-100 rpm takes up the rapidly falling film zones of atomized reaction mixture (3) and leads the reaction rapidly to form product nanoparticles with rigid control of size in presence of surfactant micelles. The dimensions of spray semi batch reactor are as given in Fig. 1. The temperature of reaction mixture was regulated through PID type of control (2) of electrical heating of<br><br>
coils (13) maintained in jacket (19) of reactor through set point comparison (08) with that indicated by thermowel (12). The baffles (4) are maintained in the path of exhaust at the top of reactor to recover the entrained Nanoparticles from outgoing air. The exhaust is then led through entrainment separator for recovery of residual Nanoparticles. A butterfly valve (7) located at dish bottom of the reactor discharges the reaction mixture for filtration of product from reaction mixture. Siphoning arrangement (11) is provided to maintain the level of reaction mixture in the reactor and also for decanting the excess solvent. The process is monitored through control of orifice size, reciprocating compressor pressure, discharge flow rate, speed, reaction temperature, distance between atomizer and reaction zone, spreader pattern etc.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred by means of agitator at 75-100 rpm so as to prevent agglomeration of particles and to renew reaction surfaces.<br>
After providing residence time of 20 min, the product was separated through fine porosity filter followed by repeated deionised water washing to remove ammonium chloride formed as by product. The product was air dried to obtain particles in powdery form. Reaction:<br>
CaCI2 +2NH4HCO3 ® CaCO3 (Nanoparticles) ¯ + 2NH4CI +CO2­+ H2O<br>

The yield of CaCO3 nanoparticles was 87%. The synthesized particles (in powdery form) were characterized by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), and X-ray Diffraction Technique. The TEM indicated the particle size varying from 1 to 80 nm.<br><br>
Nano CaCO3 finds wide use as spacing extender in Paint formulations as part replacement for hiding TiO2 pigment.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
4 M solution of ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4 ) and 2 M solution of Barium Chloride (BaCI2) containing 0.4% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate were prepared separately and sprayed in stoichiometric proportions at the rate of 0.023ml/sec and 0.01ml/ Sec, respectively, by using atomizer in the form of fine droplets into the reactor containing sufficient water covering impeller blades.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred by means of agitator at 75-100 rpm so as to prevent agglomeration of particles and to renew reaction surfaces.<br>
After providing residence time of 30 min, the product was separated through fine porosity filter followed by repeated deionised water washing to remove ammonium chloride formed as by product. The product was air dried to obtain particles in powdery form. Reaction:<br>
((NH4)2SO4 + BaCI2. 2H2O ® BaSO4 (Nanoparticles) ¯ + 2NH4CI + 2H2O<br>
precipitator	Precursor	Water insoluble	Water soluble<br>
The yield of BaSO4 nanopaticles was 79%. The synthesized particles (in powdery form) were characterized by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), and X-ray Diffraction Technique. The TEM indicated the particle size varying from 5 to 90 nm. Nano BaSO4 finds wide use as extender to promote rub resistance of Automotive Surfacer of composite automotive paints.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
25 % v/v solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and 2.5 M solution of Magnesium chloride (MgCI2) containing 0.2% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate were prepared separately and sprayed in stoichiometric proportions at the rate of 0.0425ml/sec and 0.01ml/ Sec respectively, by using atomizer in the form of fine droplets into the reactor containing sufficient water covering impeller blades.<br><br>
The reaction mixture was stirred by means of agitator at 75-100 rpm so as to prevent agglomeration of particles and to renew reaction surfaces.<br>
After providing residence time of 20 min, the product was separated through fine porosity filter followed by repeated deionised water washing to remove ammonium chloride formed as by product. The product was air dried to obtain particles in powdery form.<br>
Reaction:<br>
MgCl2  + 2 NH4OH   ®   Mg (OH)2 (Nanoparticles) ¯     +      2NH4CI<br>
precursor     precipitator	Water insoluble	Water soluble<br>
The yield of Mg (OH)2 nanoparticles was 86%. The synthesized particles (in powdery form) were characterized by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), and X-ray Diffraction Technique. The TEM indicated the particle size varying from 1 to 80 nm. Nano Mg (OH)2 finds wide use as filler to promote fire retardance of polymer composites.<br>
The different variables governing degree of atomization and intimacy of reactant contact were established for all the three examples. The illustrations of effects of these variables have been provided for synthesis of calcium carbonate (CaC03) nanopartcles in example 4 to 8.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The viscosity of the reaction phase was varied between 12 to 20 cp by addition of PEG (Mw. 6000) to reaction bath. Higher the viscosity of reaction phase, lower was the chances of aggregation. However use of protective colloids necessitated increase in washing frequencies resulting in drop in yield form 25-50 % of the regular yield.<br>
The viscosity of the precipitator/ precursor solution was varied between 10 to 12 cp based on the concentration of reactants. Lower the viscosity of stream passing through the atomizer orifice, better was the degree of atomization. Lower viscosity of atomized droplets provided better reaction contact.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The nozzle orifice diameter was varied from 0.02 to 0.09 cm. Smaller the orifice better was the degree of atomization. However, smaller orifice must have good spreading pattern for permitting larger distribution of atomized droplets over reaction surface. The spreader pattern was used to adjust the shape of the stream of atomized droplets coming from the atomizer. An elliptical cross sectional pattern permitted more efficient application.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The CMC's of different surfactants vary over a wider range from about 10"7 to 10"3 gm/lit. Presence of surfactant in reaction phase at concentrations exceeding its CMC permits reaction in micelle mode and thus controls stabilization of nanoparticles size through entropic and/or electrical double layered stabilization. Addition of surfactant in reactant stream passing through orifice at CMC level reduces surface tension to a lower magnitude and lower the surface tension, better will be the atomization.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
The distance between reaction zone and atomizer orifice was varied by changing the angle of spray with the horizontal plane from 0° (shortest) to 90° (longest). Larger the distance, better was the distribution of atomized droplets over reaction zone permitting correct fan pattern and minimum bounce back loss. At the same time, with increase in distance some atomized droplets missed the reaction surface, thus causing increase in overspray and fallout losses.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Increase in reaction temperature from 30 to 50 °C increased reaction speed, thus enhancing formation rate of nanoparticles. But at the same time increase in temperature of reaction phase reduced its viscosity, increased kinetic energy of nanoparticles causing more no. of interparticle collisions leading to aggregation. Increasing temperature of reaction stream passing through orifice (hot spray) reduces viscosity, permits better atomization and allows handling of concentrated solutions, hence permitting more production rates. The reproducibility of the method is governed by precision of control with manual spray application.<br><br>
