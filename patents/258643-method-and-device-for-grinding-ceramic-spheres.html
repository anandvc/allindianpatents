Method and device for grinding ceramic spheres<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for grinding ceramic spheres.<br>
The term "ceramic spheres" is to be understood in the context of the present patent<br>
application as referring to spheres made of ceramic materials such as, for example, oxide<br>
ceramics, carbides, silicon nitride, precious and semiprecious stones but also glass.<br>
Currently, the grinding of ceramic spheres for achieving low degrees of surface roughness and<br>
high quality classes is generally carried out using devices such as are also used for the<br>
machining of metal spheres. The ceramic spheres are in this case not actually ground but<br>
rather lapped. Whereas in the machining of metallic spheres there is provided initially coarse<br>
grinding and then fine grinding using grinding wheels with bound abrasive grains and lapping<br>
is optionally practised thereafter with abrasive grains present in paste form, ceramic spheres<br>
are not machined using grinding wheels but rather lapped over the entire abrasion process.<br>
The abrasive grains present in the grinding paste are in this case generally in diamond form.<br>
Technologically, this process is exceptionally difficult to carry out, for the abrasion rate is in<br>
the order of magnitude of at most 100 um per day. The abrasion to be realised of from 0.2 to<br>
0.4 in sphere diameter corresponds to the thickness of the inhomogeneous boundary layer and<br>
is in some cases achieved only in a machining time of several days. In addition, after the<br>
lapping process, the ceramic spheres are markedly soiled by adhering grinding paste. In the<br>
conventional methods for washing the spheres, this grinding paste is in some cases very<br>
difficult to remove. The degree of wear of the two metal discs is extremely high during<br>
lapping with loose diamond grains. Finally, the very high consumption of diamonds greatly<br>
increases the costs of the method as a whole. As a result, the use of ceramic spheres has<br>
become established, especially in the field of ball bearings, only in applications in which costs<br>
are of secondary importance.<br>
An attempt to improve the cost-effectiveness is found in US patent specification US<br>
6,171,179 Bl. In the grinder provided in said document, a grinding wheel is provided with<br>
electro lyrically bound abrasive grains. The fixed guide disc has a number of guide rings<br>
which are each hydraulically loaded individually to ensure optimally uniform pressing of the<br><br>
2<br>
ceramic spheres against the grinding wheel. This device has not proven successful in practice.<br>
It is believed that the service life of the grinding wheel is too short.<br>
Japanese patent application JP 05042467 A discloses a method for the polishing of silicon<br>
nitride spheres using polishing discs having abrasive grains of from 5 to 60 per cent by<br>
volume of Cr2O3 with an average particle diameter of from 0.01 to 3 urn. The machining of<br>
the spheres is very low with regard to the speed of abrasion of the surface. In a test, abrasion<br>
of 60 um was achieved over 50 hours, i.e. approximately 1 urn per hour. The degree of<br>
surface roughness achieved in a second test is Ra = 0.005 urn. This method, which also<br>
proposes replacing a portion of the Cr2O3 with diamond, is suitable for achieving high surface<br>
qualities, although the abrasion rate is still unsatisfactory for the grinding of ceramic spheres.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a method and a device for grinding<br>
ceramic spheres allowing more economical manufacture of ceramic spheres having the<br>
requisite quality and low divergence in the diameter of the spheres.<br>
This object is achieved by a method having the features of claim 1 and by a device having the<br>
features of claim 9.<br>
Because the grinding is carried out using a grinding wheel with abrasive grains bound in a<br>
synthetic resin, wherein the abrasive grains consist of more than 50% diamond and less than<br>
5% Cr2O3, high abrasion rates can be achieved with a low degree of wear of the grinding<br>
wheel or the abrasive lining. It is advantageous if the abrasive grains are free from Cr2O3 and,<br>
in particular, if the abrasive grains consist of pure diamond. This allows an abrasion rate<br>
almost ten times higher than that of the closest prior art, whereas the average degree of<br>
surface roughness is greater by a factor of 10 than in the prior art. The diamond content of the<br>
abrasive grains is therefore greater than 50%, in particular greater than 90% and particularly<br>
preferred are abrasive grains consisting of 100% diamond.<br>
Advantageously, the synthetic resin bonding is a hot-pressed phenolic resin bonding or<br>
polyimide bonding, the pore volume preferably being close to zero.<br>
The grinding wheel preferably has a grain size of from D181 (in accordance with the FEPA<br>
standard, average particle diameter =181 um) to D2 (average particle diameter = 2 um), grain<br><br>
3<br>
sizes of from D181 to D25 being used for coarse grinding and grain sizes of from D15 to D2<br>
being preferred for fine grinding.<br>
During use, grinding wheels undergo slight deformation if they are fastened, in particular<br>
attached using putty, to a support plate as an abrasive lining. The degree of wear is further<br>
reduced if the cooling lubricant added is a honing oil.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides for two grinding wheels to be used in a stone-<br>
to-stone process, the two grinding wheels being, in particular, of substantially identical<br>
construction.<br>
The above-described method is possible as a result of the fact that provision is made, in a<br>
device according to the invention for grinding ceramic spheres using a grinding wheel with<br>
bound abrasive diamond grains, for the grinding wheel to have a synthetic resin bonding, in<br>
particular a hot-pressed phenolic resin bonding. The grinding wheel can in this case be<br>
attached to a support plate using putty, thus promoting the mechanical stability under the<br>
process pressure and minimising the material costs for the manufacture of the wheel.<br>
Also in accordance with the invention is the use of a grinding wheel with abrasive diamond<br>
grains bound in a synthetic resin for the grinding of ceramic spheres, especially using a<br>
conventional sphere grinder, such as is known for the grinding of metallic spheres.<br>
The present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings and also<br>
with reference to three examples. In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a device for the grinding of spheres with a grinding wheel and a vertical drive<br>
axis; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a device for the grinding of spheres in a stone-to-stone process with a vertical<br>
axis.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the principle of the grinding of spheres on machines with a vertical drive<br>
axis. Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view and side view of the device for grinding spheres. A fixed<br>
guide disc, made preferably of cast steel, is provided in this case. The guide disc 1 has on its<br><br>
4<br>
underside peripheral guide grooves in which a large number of spheres 2 to be ground are<br>
guided. Provided from the underside is a support plate 3 which has an abrasive lining 3 a<br>
arranged thereon and can be caused to rotate by a drive shaft. A sphere inlet and outlet 4 is<br>
provided for loading and unloading the device.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a grinder similar to that illustrated in Fig. 1. In the case of this grinder, the fixed<br>
guide plate 1 is also provided with an abrasive lining la arranged opposing the abrasive lining<br>
3a of the rotating support plate 3. The spheres 2 to be ground are arranged between the two<br>
grinding wheels la and 3a.<br>
In both embodiments, for the purposes of grinding, a pressure P is exerted on the fixed guide<br>
disc 1 from the upper side. The support plate 3 is caused to rotate by a drive, so the spheres 2<br>
roll off in the guide grooves. The differences in speed in the various regions of the guide<br>
grooves cause movement of the abrasive lining relative to the surface of the ceramic sphere.<br>
The abrasive grains located in the abrasive lining then lead to abrasion of the surface of the<br>
sphere and thus to improvement of the surface quality and the spherical shape.<br>
The method according to the invention can be carried out in this case both on a sphere grinder<br>
comprising a vertical drive shaft and on a sphere grinder comprising a horizontal drive shaft.<br>
During the grinding process, the cooling lubricant added is a honing oil which both rinses<br>
around the abrasive grains and the ceramic sphere and removes abrasive grains, bonding<br>
particles and ground-off spheres broken out of the surface of the grinding wheels, so such<br>
elements do not adhere to the surface of the sphere and adversely affect the grinding process.<br>
The results achieved using the method according to the invention will be described hereinafter<br>
with reference to three test examples.<br>
Tests 1 to 3 used a grinding wheel having a diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 4 mm.<br>
The grinding wheel was attached to a steel support plate using putty. The cooling lubricant<br>
added was the honing oil EMOL®-O-HON 920 NV from ML Lubrication GmbH. The<br>
pressure plate consisted of steel and had five peripheral grooves. The grinding was carried out<br>
without a hopper on a grinder having a vertical axis.<br><br>
5<br>
Test 1:<br>
Round spheres made of zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and having starting dimensions of from<br>
5.96 mm to 6.03 mm were machined. A batch contained approximately 140 spheres. The final<br>
dimensions achieved were 5.50 mm. The abrasion was 504 um over a grinding time of 4<br>
hours. The abrasion rate was therefore approximately 125 um per hour. The depth of the<br>
grooves in the grinding wheel after completion of the test was 0.5 mm.<br>
Test 2:<br>
Barrel-shaped spheres made of ZrO2 and having starting dimensions of 5.72 mm x 5.25 mm<br>
were machined. In total, the batch comprised 300 blanks. The final dimensions were<br>
5.15 mm. The average abrasion was 570 um over a grinding time of 3.5 hours. This<br>
corresponds to an average abrasion rate of 152 um per hour. The depth of the grooves in the<br>
grinding wheel after completion of the test was 0.94 mm.<br>
Test 3:<br>
Spheres made of silicon nitride (Si3N4) having starting dimensions of 5.34 mm were<br>
machined. A batch contained 300 blanks. The final dimensions were 5.16 mm. The average<br>
abrasion was 180 um over a grinding time of 3.5 hours. The average abrasion rate was 51 um<br>
per hour. The depth of the grooves in the grinding wheel after completion of the test was<br>
1.10 mm.<br>
The specified groove depths are based on the same grinding wheel, as the same wheel was<br>
used in all three successive tests. Test 2 accordingly started with a groove depth of 0.5 mm,<br>
whereas Test 3 started with a groove depth of 0.94 mm. The groove depth therefore increased<br>
in size, for example, in Test 3 merely by 0.16 mm.<br>
Test 4:<br>
Spheres made of silicon nitride (S13N4) having starting dimensions of 6.12 mm were<br>
machined. A total of 340 items were machined in a test. The grinding time was 9 hours. The<br><br>
6<br>
final diameter achieved was 5.956 mm. This corresponds to abrasion of up to 120 |im over 9<br>
hours. The achieved degree of surface roughness Ra is from 0.05 urn to 0.06 urn.<br>
The tests reveal that a good abrasion rate is achieved even at a low groove depth. Normally in<br>
the grinding of spheres abrasion does not commence until groove depths of approximately<br>
20% of the diameter of the sphere. At low groove depths, as in the present three tests, the<br>
geometry of the spheres is usually also relatively poor. However, the results of the three tests<br>
reveal that high abrasion, good roundness and outstanding divergence in diameter could be<br>
achieved even at a very low depth of the grooves in the grinding wheel. Compared to the high<br>
abrasion values, the degree of wear to the grinding wheel is very low. It is noteworthy that the<br>
elongate, barrel-shaped blanks in Test 2 can be machined just as well as round spherical<br>
blanks.<br>
The good abrasion rate and the low degree of wear to the grinding wheel or the abrasive<br>
lining attached to the support plate using putty are due to the bonding of the abrasive grains in<br>
a synthetic resin. This bonding, in contrast to the electrolytic bonding in the prior art, ensures<br>
low resilient movement of the abrasive grains in the bonding matrix. This resilience allows<br>
the abrasive grains to deflect in the microscopic range in the event of peak loads such as can<br>
be caused by the extremely hard ceramic spheres, thus greatly increasing the service life of<br>
the grinding wheel. The abrasion rate is also improved because the spheres form grooves in<br>
the grinding wheel during the grinding process. The depth of the grooves is relatively low. It<br>
is, however, greater than in the case of electrolytically bound grinding wheels which are able<br>
to form almost no grooves.<br>
Finally, it is to be expected, in the case of electrolytically bound abrasive diamond grains on a<br>
metallic carrier plate, that damage to the bonding will lead to breaking-out of entire regions of<br>
the bonding and thus to falling-out of the grinding wheel, and this is not the case in a grinding<br>
wheel bound in a synthetic resin, as a result of its self-sharpening mechanism.<br>
As a result, the ground spheres were good in terms of roundness and the divergence in<br>
diameter. The abrasion rate is greater than the abrasion rates of known methods by at least<br>
one order of magnitude. The degree of surface roughness was examined merely in one case.<br>
Provision may be made in this regard for lapping to be provided after the coarse and fine<br>
grinding.<br><br>
7<br>
The novel method and the novel device for grinding ceramic spheres allow not only high<br>
abrasion rates with good grinding results but also the use of grinders accessible to modern<br>
streamlined methods. The use of hoppers for supplying the spheres is thus, for example,<br>
possible. The use of cooling lubricants allows the grinding processes to be technologically<br>
controlled and corresponding filter means to be connected, as a result of which the method<br>
can be made extremely environmentally friendly. The cleaning of the spheres after the<br>
grinding process is also particularly simple and can be carried out in conventional sphere<br>
washers as there is no adhering grinding paste as is typical for lapping.<br><br>
