				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Distribution connection module for telecommunication<br>
and data technology<br>
The invention relates to a distribution<br>
connection module for telecommunications and data<br>
technology, comprising a housing in which input and<br>
output contacts for the connection of cables or wires<br>
are arranged such that they are externally accessible,<br>
and to a method for producing the distribution<br>
connection modules.<br>
Such a distribution connection module is known,<br>
for example, from DE 27 25 551. The distribution<br>
connection module comprises a first row of connecting<br>
contacts on the cable side and, opposite this, a second<br>
row of connecting contacts on. the jumper side, in which<br>
case the contacts on the cable side may be regarded as<br>
input contacts, and the contacts on the jumper side may<br>
be regarded as output contacts, even when the<br>
information flow may be in the opposite direction.<br>
Center contacts, into which test or protection<br>
connectors can be inserted, are arranged between the<br>
rows. Three-point or five-point overvoltage protection<br>
modules or coordinated protection circuits represent<br>
one example of such protection connectors. If such an<br>
overvoltage protection device is now inserted into the<br>
center contacts, then this center tap and, in some<br>
cases, adjacent center taps as well, is no longer<br>
accessible for inspection and test purposes, or the<br>
overvoltage protection device must be removed again for<br>
test and inspection purposes, so that the contacts are<br>
not protected during this time.<br>
Furthermore, distribution connection modules<br>
are known, for example, from DE 39 17 270, in which<br>
functional elements such as coordinated protection<br>
circuits can be inserted into the distribution<br>
connection module at the sides or from underneath. A<br>
disadvantage in this case is that the distribution<br>
connection modules have to be manufactured in a<br>
correspondingly complex manner.<br>
A common feature of rail distribution connection<br>
modules is that the external functional elements must<br>
be plugged into sprung contacts, which need to be<br>
subject to stringent requirements with regard to the<br>
withstand voltage and current carrying capacity. A<br>
further disadvantage is that the external functional<br>
elements cause interference in compact, modular<br>
designs.<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical<br>
problem of providing a distribution module for<br>
telecommunications and data technology, by means of<br>
which simpler and more compact construction is<br>
possible. A further technical problem is to provide a<br>
production method.<br>
The technical problem is solved by the subject<br>
matters of the features in patent claims 1 and 17.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the invention are<br>
evident from the dependent claims.<br>
For this purpose, the housing of the<br>
distribution connection module is designed with a <br>
cavity in which functional elements are arranged<br>
between the input and output contacts. This results in<br>
the capability for very compact construction. In this<br>
case, in principle, the housing may be formed in one or<br>
more parts.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the functional<br>
elements are arranged on a printed circuit board which<br>
is supported in the housing. For this purpose, the<br>
housing is preferably designed in a number of parts, so<br>
that the printed circuit board can be pushed into a<br>
first housing part, and can then be locked in place by<br>
means of a second housing part. Depending on the<br>
application, differently populated printed circuit<br>
boards can thus be used, and defective printed circuit<br>
boards replaced, very easily.<br>
The input contacts are preferably in the form<br>
of insulation-displacement contacts, so that the wires<br>
and cables on the cable side can be connected quickly,<br>
reliably and flexibly using known techniques. Depending<br>
on the application, the output contacts are preferably<br>
likewise in the form of insulation-displacement<br>
contacts or plug connectors. The advantage of plug<br>
connectors is that, if prefabricated cables are<br>
available, the wiring process can be carried out very<br>
quickly and reliably simply by plug insertion. In<br>
situations where there are no prefabricated cables, the<br>
advantages of insulation-displacement contacts are<br>
applicable, on the other hand.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the<br>
insulation-displacement contacts are each in the form<br>
of a contact in the form of a fork, by means ot which a<br>
force-fitting electrical connection to the functional<br>
elements can be produced. If the functional elements<br>
are arranged on a printed circuit board, then contact<br>
pads are arranged on the printed circuit board,<br>
preferably on both sides, on the top and bottom. These<br>
force-fitting connections are considerable more<br>
tolerant to manufacturing and assembly tolerances than<br>
soldered joints. In this way, all the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts can be made contact with<br>
simultaneously by latching the contacts in the form of<br>
forks onto the contact pads. Furthermore, this method<br>
of making contact allows simple disassembly if, for<br>
example, a defective printed circuit board needs to be<br>
replaced.<br>
Functional elements may be filter circuits,<br>
signaling devices or test circuits. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the functional element is an overvoltage<br>
protection module, in particular a coordinated<br>
protection device. This results in integrated<br>
overvoltage protection which neither prevents<br>
subsequent jumpering, inspection or testing nor causes<br>
interference when module groups are assembled.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, each input<br>
and output contact has an associated isolating contact,<br>
which is externally accessible. The isolating contact<br>
is in each case arranged in series behind the<br>
functional elements. If the functional elements are in<br>
the form of overvoltage protection, the isolating<br>
contact is fully protected.<br>
If the functional elements are arranged on a <br>
printed circuit board, the isolating contacts are<br>
prererably arranged on the underneath of the printed<br>
circuit board, with the isolating contacts preferably<br>
being accessible from the same side as the input<br>
contacts.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the output<br>
contacts are arranged on the opposite side of the<br>
housing to the input contacts. This achieves clear<br>
separation between the cable side and the jumpering<br>
side, in which case there is no interference between<br>
the individual wires and cables.<br>
If the input and/or output contacts are in the<br>
form of insulation-displacement contacts, then they are<br>
dimensioned with respect to one another in such a way<br>
that the existing standard connecting tools can be<br>
used. This saves the development of new and costly<br>
connecting tools, and simplifies the handling of the<br>
new distribution connection module in conjunction with<br>
already existing distribution connection modules.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the ground<br>
lines on the printed circuit board are formed by a<br>
contact which is in. the form of a ring or fork and is<br>
externally accessible. To this end, ground lines are<br>
preferably joined together on the printed circuit<br>
board. The distribution connection module can then be<br>
pushed onto profiled rods using appropriate holes or<br>
openings, with the profiled rods then being connected<br>
to the contact which is in the form of a ring or fork.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the ground<br>
lines are designed to be accessible from the input<br>
contact side. This optionally allows the distribution<br>
connection module to be used as an AB or ABS module,<br>
with the shields being connected to the ground lines.<br>
In order to produce the distribution connection<br>
module according to the invention, the printed circuit<br>
board, with the functional elements, is pushed into a<br>
first housing part, and a second housing part, which is<br>
fitted with the input contacts, is latched onto it. The<br>
advantage of this method is that the component<br>
placement process and the latching can easily be<br>
automated. In embodiments with isolating contacts,<br>
there are in principle various variants.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment, the isolating<br>
contacts are firstly mounted on the printed circuit<br>
board, where the isolating contacts are clamped in in<br>
an appropriate manner. The printed circuit board is<br>
then pushed, with the clamped-in isolating contacts,<br>
into the first housing part, which is then latched to<br>
the second housing part. In consequence, no furnishings<br>
are required on the housing to adversely affect its<br>
robustness.<br>
In art alternative -embodiment, the printed<br>
circuit board is first of all pushed into the first<br>
housing part, and the isolating contacts are then<br>
attached to the printed circuit board and clamped in<br>
from the underneath of the housing. This makes it<br>
possible to retrofit the distribution connection<br>
modules with isolating contacts very easily.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail<br>
in the following text with reference to a preferred<br>
exemplary embodiment. In the figures:<br>

connection module,<br>

producing a distribution connection module,<br>

alternative method for producing a<br>

and<br>
Figure 7 shows an exploded illustration of a<br>
distribution connection module.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section of the<br>
distribution connection module 1 with a test connector<br>
2 inserted. The distribution connection module 1<br>
comprises a housing 3, input contacts 4, output<br>
contacts 5 and a printed circuit board 6 arranged in<br>
the cavity in the housing 3. The input contacts 4 are<br>
in the form of insulation-displacing contacts for<br>
making contact with wires 7 which are accessible from a<br>
Yirst end face 8 of the housing 3. On the side facing<br>
the printed circuit board 6, the input contacts 4 are<br>
formed with contacts 9 in the form of forks. The<br>
contacts 9 in the form of forks engage around the<br>
printed circuit board 6 and form a force-fitting<br>
connection to contact pads arranged on the top and<br>
bottom of the printed circuit board 6. Coordinated<br>
protection circuits are arranged on the printed circuit<br>
board 6, and are located between the input contacts 4<br>
and the output contacts 5. In this case, each<br>
coordinated protection device has two associated input<br>
contacts 4 and two associated output contacts 5. The<br>
coordinated protection device comprises a surge<br>
arrester 11, two PTC thermistors 12 and two diodes 13,<br>
whose ground lines are connected via a contact 14, in<br>
the form of a ring or fork, to a profiled rod 15 which<br>
passes through the housing 3. Located behind the<br>
coordination protection device is the isolating contact<br>
10, which is arranged on the underneath of the printed<br>
circuit board 6, with the printed circuit board 6 being<br>
plated through, for example close to the diodes 13, for<br>
electrical connection of the coordinated protection<br>
device and the isolating contact 10. The isolating<br>
contact 10 is located on a support 16 which is fixed in<br>
the housing 3. The isolating contact is prestressed in<br>
a sprung manner via a clamping device 17, so that the<br>
bent contacts 18, 19 make contact with the printed<br>
circuit board 6. Behind the contact 19 there is an<br>
electrical connection to the output contacts 5, which<br>
are connected to the printed circuit board 6 via a<br>
soldered, press or plug connection 20. Thus, without a<br>
test connector 2, the input contacts 4 are connected<br>
via the coordinated protection device and the<br>
downstream isolating contact 10 to the output contacts<br>
5. For test purposes, a test connector 2 with a board<br>
27 can then be pushed into the housing 3 from the end<br>
face 8. In consequence, the contact 19 of the isolating<br>
contact 10 is pushed away from the printed circuit<br>
board 6, as shown, and the electrical connection<br>
between the input and output contacts 4, 5 is<br>
disconnected or is made via the test connector 2. Since<br>
the isolating contact 10 is arranged behind the<br>
coordinated protection device, the isolating contact 10<br>
remains fully protected against overvoltage even during<br>
test activities using the test connector 2. Since large<br>
forces can occur when connecting the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts, a holding or supporting element<br>
in the form of plastic can also be latched onto the<br>
printed circuit board 6 in the area of the contacts 9<br>
in the form of forks and over the full width of the<br>
printed circuit board 6, thus fixing the contacts 9 in<br>
the form of forks on the printed circuit board 6.<br>
Figure 2 shows a front view of the end face 8<br>
of the distribution connection module 1. The<br>
distribution connection module 1 has 16 input contacts<br>
4 which are combined in pairs and are used, for<br>
example, for connecting pairs of wires. An access 23<br>
for a test connector 21 is arranged under each pair of<br>
input contacts 4. The isolating contacts are externally<br>
accessible via this access 23. In this case, the two<br>
isolating contacts of the two input contacts 4 are<br>
operated at the same time by inserting a test connector<br>
21 into the access 23. The housing 3 also has cable<br>
guides 24 and strain-relief devices 25.<br>
Figure 3 shows, schematically, the circuit<br>
arrangement for a distribution connection module having<br>
coordinated protection devices as functional elements.<br>
The circuit has 16 input contacts a1, b1 - a8, b8 and<br>
16 output contacts a1', b1'- a8', b8', with each a, b<br>
pair being used to connect a pair of wires. The input<br>
and- output contacts a, b and a', b', respectively, in<br>
this case correspond to the input and output contacts<br>
4, 5 in Figure 1. In this case, two input contacts in<br>
each case have an associated coordinated protection<br>
device. As already described in Figure 1, each<br>
coordinated protection device comprises a three-pole<br>
surge arrester 11, two PTC thermistors 12 and two<br>
diodes 13. Each surge arrester 11 has an associated<br>
fail-safe contact 26 with at least one fuse element,<br>
which permanently shorts the two input contacts to<br>
ground when an overvoltage occurs. The two isolating<br>
contacts 10 are arranged between the coordinated<br>
protection device and the two associated output<br>
contacts.<br>
Figure 4 shows, schematically, a production<br>
method for a distribution connection module 1 as shown<br>
in Figure 1. In a first method step A, the isolating<br>
contacts 10 with their clamping devices 17 are mounted<br>
on a common support or separate support 16 on the<br>
underneath of the printed circuit board 6. Then, in a<br>
method step B, the fully populated printed circuit<br>
board 6 is pushed into the cavity of a first housing<br>
part 21. Then, in a further method step C, a second<br>
housing part 22, in which the input contacts 4 are<br>
arranged, is latched onto the first housing part 21.<br>
Figure 5, shows schematically, an alternative<br>
production method. In this case, the fully populated<br>
printed circuit board 6 is first of all pushed into the<br>
first housing part 21 in a first method step A and<br>
then, in a method step B, the isolating contacts 10 are<br>
inserted from the underneath of the first housing part<br>
21. The second housing part 22 is then once again<br>
latched onto the first housing part 21, in the method<br>
step C.<br>
Figure 6 shows a block diagram of a<br>
distribution connection module 1 having an ADSL<br>
splitter as a functional group in which case ADSL<br>
represents an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. ADSL<br>
is a transmission technology for providing broadband<br>
data terminations via the conventional copper-cable<br>
access network. ADSL systems are, without exception,<br>
designed as bi-directional transmission systems using<br>
both traffic directions (downstream and upstream). The<br>
downstream channel;' in the direction of the user, is<br>
designed to be broadband while, in contrast, the<br>
upstream channel in the opposite direction has a<br>
relatively narrow bandwidth and is intended primarily<br>
for transmitting control messages. Application examples<br>
for ADSL include, in particular, video on demand and<br>
multimedia Internet applications. The distribution<br>
connection module 1 has input contacts 4, output<br>
contacts 5 and test accesses 28. Furthermore, the<br>
distribution connection module 1 has at least one<br>
printed circuit board 6 on which overvoltage protection<br>
29, a low-pass filter 30 and an isolating capacitor 31<br>
are arranged. The ADSL splitter is formed by the low-<br>
pass filter 30 and the isolating capacitor 31 and<br>
isolates the radio-frequency ADSL signal, which is<br>
produced at the right-hand output 5, from a low-<br>
frequency POTS or ISDN signal, which is produced at the<br>
left-hand output 5 while, in contrast, the input 4<br>
represents the subscriber access. For clarification, it<br>
should be noted that, due to the bi-directional<br>
transmission, signals are transmitted from the input 4<br>
to the output 5 and vice versa, so that the terms<br>
"input" and "output" relate to the different<br>
information-technology connection sides of the<br>
distribution connection module. The isolating capacitor<br>
31 is used to isolate the DC operating voltage from the<br>
ADSL port. In applications where this function is<br>
already provided in the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line<br>
Access Multiplexer), the isolating capacitor 31 can be<br>
omitted. The filter characteristic of the low-pass<br>
filter " 30 is preferably matched to the ADSL systems<br>
used in DTAG, which use only the 138 kHz frequency-<br>
band, and are thus also ISDN-compatible. In principle,<br>
other configurations with special optimization to<br>
individual services are feasible. The optional<br>
overvoltage -protection 29 is used for protection<br>
against transient overvoltages, and improves the<br>
capability of the assembly to withstand voltages<br>
resulting from pulsed interference at, for example,<br>
4 kV. The test accesses 28, which are preferably in the<br>
form of plug connectors, in particular SUB-D plug<br>
connectors, are used in order to permanently feed the<br>
signal on the subscriber line to an external switching<br>
device and test set, and back again. The splitter can<br>
be operated without this external loop by inserting an<br>
appropriate short-circuiting connector. The main type<br>
of operation for the ADSL splitter is as the main<br>
distribution module.<br>
Figure 7 shows an exploded illustration of the<br>
distribution connection module 1 shown in Figure 6. The<br>
distribution connection module 1 has a first housing<br>
part 21 and a second housing part 22. The second<br>
housing part 22 has a row of input contacts 4 and<br>
output contacts 5, which are each in the form of<br>
insulation-displacement contacts. The input contacts 4<br>
and the output contacts 5 are each arranged in<br>
connection strips, whose housing upper parts 32 and 33,<br>
respectively, are latched on via the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts. The housing upper parts 32, 33<br>
are each formed with latching elements 34, which engage<br>
in corresponding latching grooves 35 in the housing<br>
lower parts 36, 37 of the connection strips. The<br>
connection strip is preferably in the form of an ABS<br>
strip, so that a shield which is associated with the<br>
double conductors can also be connected, thus improving<br>
the crosstalk attenuation between the subscriber lines<br>
on which the ADSL signal is carried. The output<br>
contacts 5 form the ports for the POTS/ISDN lines. The<br>
second housing part 22 also has latching means 38,<br>
which correspond with corresponding latching grooves 39<br>
in the first housing part 21. Two printed circuit<br>
boards 6 are arranged in the first housing part 21 and<br>
are electrically connected to the input contacts 4 and<br>
output contacts 5. The test accesses 28 and the other<br>
output contacts 5 for the ADSL port are arranged on the<br>
rear face of the first housing part 21, and are<br>
preferably each in the form of SUB-D plug connectors.<br>
On the side walls, the first housing part 21 is formed<br>
with cable bushings" 24 and two annular contacts 14, via<br>
which the ground lines of the printed circuit board .6<br>
are connected to a profiled rod which is used as a<br>
ground rail.<br>
