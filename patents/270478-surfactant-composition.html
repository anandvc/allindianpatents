SURFACTANT COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel surfactant composition, and, specifically, to a surfactant composition containing an alkyl ether sulfate having a specified structure.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
As various nonionic surfactants and anionic surfactants which are generally used at present, those derived from alcohols originated from petrochemical raw materials or alcohols originated from oil and fats raw materials are known.<br>
As the method of producing alcohols originated from petrochemical raw materials which alcohols are called synthetic alcohols, for example, there is a method in which a compound having an internal olefin is derived by an oligomerization reaction through ethylene and then converted into an alcohol derivative by oxo reaction.  It is known that the synthetic alcohol obtained resultantly is a mixture containing about 2 0% by weight of branched alcohols besides about 80% by weight of linear alcohols. It is known that various nonionic surfactants and anionic surfactants derived from synthetic alcohols have such<br>
excellent characteristics that they are superior in low-temperature stability because they have a lower melting point and low coagulation point than derivatives from linear alcohols.<br>
On the other hand, it is known that various nonionic surfactants and anionic surfactants derived from alcohols originated from oil and fats raw materials which alcohols are one type of natural alcohols have the characteristics such as high foaming ability, low cmc, high cloud point and high emulsifying ability.<br>
As mentioned above, the surfactants derived from synthetic alcohols are different from those derived from natural type alcohols in properties and performances. Therefore, it is usually necessary to use different surfactants according to the use of the surfactant at present.<br>
There is an increased and worldwide demand for natural alcohols in view of the carbon neutral at present. However, surfactants derived from natural alcohols have the drawbacks that they are inferior to those derived from synthetic alcohols in low temperature stability. Therefore, there is a fear that they have not a little adverse influence on the appearance and performance of a system in which they are blended.<br>
If natural alcohols or their derivatives can impart the same characteristics and performances as synthetic alcohols or their derivatives without losing their excellent characteristics and performances, the use of an alcohol in<br>
accordance to the state of affairs of rawmaterials is largely expected regardless of the purpose and use. Therefore, there is currently a strong desire to develop technologies for reforming the properties of natural alcohols and their derivatives.<br>
Examples of major alcohol type anionic surfactants include alkyl sulfates (AS) and alkyl ether sulfates (AES) . These surfactants are widely used not only for domestic uses such as dish detergents , shampoos, body detergents, clothing detergents and house detergents but also for chemical uses such as emulsion polymerization emulsifiers and dyeing adjuvants. These surfactnats are usually formulated in a concentration as low as about 2 0% by weight or less in product formulation systems . However, an aqueous AS or AES solution has a low viscosity in this concentration range and it is necessary to adjust the aqueous solution so that the solution has a proper viscosity corresponding to its use (JP-A55-843 99, JP-A 56-72092) . Accordingly, various thickeners have been investigated so far.<br>
Currently, as the thickeners for various chemical products, fatty acid alkanolamides, such as fatty acid monoethanolamides (JP-A61-114727), fatty acid diglycol amides and fatty acid diethanolamides, reduced irritation to the skin or hairs are preferably used.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a surfactant<br>
composition comprising an alkyl ether sulfate represented by the following formula (1):<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
wherein R represents a linear alkyl group having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, PO and EO represent a propyleneoxy group and anethyleneoxygroup, respectively, mandn denote the average numbers of added moles of PO and EO, respectively, and are numbers meeting: 0
Also, the present invention relates to a surfactant composition comprising an alkyl ether sulfate represented by the formula (1) , producedby steps comprising the following steps (I) to (III):<br>
step (I) : a step of adding propylene oxide in an average amount exceeding 0 mol and less than 1 mol to 1 mol of an alcohol having a linear alkyl group having 8 to 24 carbon atoms ,-<br>
step (II): a step of adding ethylene oxide to the propylene oxide addition product obtained in the step (I) in an average amount exceeding 0 mol and 2.3 mol or less; and<br>
step (III) : a step of sulfating the alkoxylate obtained in the step (II) and neutralizing the resultant;<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
wherein R represents a linear alkyl group having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, PO and EO represent a propyleneoxy group and anethyleneoxy group, respectively, mandndenote the average numbers of added moles of PO and EO, respectively, and are numbers meeting: 0 
Also, the present invention relates to a surfactant composition which is obtained by blending compounds represented by the following formulae (2) and (3), respectively, in such a condition meeting 0 
(Formula removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same as or different from each other, represent a linear alkyl group having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, EO represents an ethyleneoxy group and AO represents an alkyleneoxy group having 3 or 4 carbon atoms, m' denotes the average number of added moles of ethylene oxide and is a number meeting: 0 
a  = { (the mole number of the compound (3) X n' ) / (the<br>
mole number of the compound (2) + the mole number of the compound (3))}<br>
Equation (a)<br>
Also, the present invention relates to a detergent composition containing the above surfactant composition of the present invention.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to use of the above surfactant composition of the present invention as a detergent.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to use of the above surfactant composition of the present invention as a thickener and the surfactant composition may be formulated in various products including detergent compositions such as body (including a hair use) detergent compositions, clothing detergent compositions and hard surface detergent compositions and cosmetic compositions.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Though fatty acid monoethanolamides and fatty acid diglycol amides are superior in thickening effect, they have the drawbacks that they have a high melting point and are therefore deteriorated in solubility when formulated in detergents or cosmetics. Particularly, when fatty acid monoethanolamides are blended in large amount and stored at low temperature, it is causes of cloudiness and darkness . Therefore, it is limited in amount to be used, product form and applications.<br>
Also, as a method of thickening an aqueous anionic surfactant, there is a method (thickening) in which an inorganic salt such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate is added to cause coagulation of micells, thereby increasing the concentration of the aqueous solution. These inorganic salts have a higher solubility than the aforementioned thickeners and are therefore used widely and commonly. However, these inorganic salts are reduced in thickening effect corresponding with the amount of these inorganic salts to be added and it is therefore necessary to add these inorganic salts in a large amount when the solution is adjusted to a desired viscosity. However, the addition of a large amount of these inorganic salts gives rise to problems concerning a change in viscosity and irritant feel during washing.<br>
In view of this situation, the inventors of the present invention have started to search an anionic surfactant composition having a high thickening effect, that is, an anionic surfactant producing a high thickening effect even in the case where the concentration of the inorganic salt is low.  It is considered that if a surfactant composition having a high thickening effect is obtained in the developments of an alcohol having both the advantageous effects given by an alcohol derived from petrochemical raw materials and an alcohol derived from oil and fats respectively, and also in the developments of various surfactants derived from these alcohols, applications for<br>
raw materials of various products including surfactant compositions derived from the alcohol having both the advantageous effects given by an alcohol derived from petrochemical raw materials and an alcohol derived from oil and fats respectively can be expanded.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have made earnest studies and, as a result, found that a surfactant composition containing a specified alkyl ether sulfate produces a high thickening effect and further, the advantageous effects develop advantageous action effects in various products (for example, detergent compositions) .<br>
The surfactant composition of the present invention has high sensitivity to inorganic salts and has a high thickening affect. Therefore, even in the case of reducing the amount of an inorganic salt to be added, the surfactant composition can form good thickening system.<br><csurfactant composition></csurfactant>

An aqueous alkali metal solution is preferable and sodium hydroxide is more preferable.<br>

Example 1<br>

After the alcohol was dehydrated, the atmosphere in the autoclave was replaced with nitrogen. After the alcohol was heated to 12 0°C, 575 g of PO was charged in the autoclave. The mixture was subjected to an addition reaction and aging carried out at 120°C and then, the mixture was heated to 14 5°C and 162 5 gof EOwas charged in the autoclave . The mixture was subjected to an addition reaction and aging carried out at 145°C and then cooled to 80°C and unreacted EO was removed under a pressure of 4.0 kPa. After the unreacted EO was removed, 7.3 g of acetic acid was added in the autoclave and the resulting mixture was stirred at 80°C for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture was discharged to obtain an alkoxylate in which the average number of added moles of PO was 0 .4 mol and the average number of added moles of EO was 1.5 mol.<br>
The obtained alkoxylate was sulfated using S03 gas in a falling film reactor (hereinafter referred to as FFR) . The obtained sulfate was neutralized by an aqueous NaOH solution to obtain a composition containing an alkyl ether<br>
sulfate. NaCl and ion exchanged water were added to the alkyl ether sulfate composition to prepare an evaluation sample containing a surfactant in a concentration of 2 0% by weight. The evaluation sample is constituted of a surfactant effective content, NaCl and water, wherein various concentrations shown in Table 1 were used as the concentration of NaCl. The viscosity of the obtained evaluation sample was measured by a Brookfield-type viscometer (B-type viscometer). The conditions of measurement are shown below. The composition of the evaluation sample (concentrations of the surfactant and NaCl) and the results of the measurement of viscosity are shown in Table 1.  In Table 1, EOp is the average number of added moles of ethylene oxide and POp is the average number of added moles of propylene oxide. (Measurement conditions)<br>

As is clear from the table, the surfactant composition containing the alkyl ether sulfate of the example produced a higher thickening effect than the surfactant composition containing the alkyl ether sulfate of the comparative example. Also, the thickening effect is significantly large in the range of POp and EOp according to the present invention. Example 4 and Comparative Example 5<br>
A sodium alkyl (12 carbon atoms/14 carbon atoms: 75% by weight/25% by weight) ether sulfate (surfactant (1-1)) in which the average number of added moles of EO was 2 mol was blended with a sodium alkyl (12 carbon atoms/14 carbon atoms: 72%byweight/28%by weight) ether sulfate (surfactant (2-1) ) in which the average number of added moles of PO was 1 mol in the ratios as shown in Table 1. Further, sodium chloride and ion exchange water were added to the mixture to prepare an evaluation sample in which the concentration of all surfactants was 2 0% by weight and the concentration of sodium chloride was 1.5% by weight. The viscosity of the obtained evaluation sample was measured in the same method as in Examples 1 to 3 . The composition of the evaluation sample and the results of measurement of viscosity are shown in Table 2.<br>
