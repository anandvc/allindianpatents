				<td>DESCRIPTION REFRIGERATING CYCLE APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating cycle apparatus equipped with a plurality of high pressure type compressors having a casing held with an oil.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a refrigerating cycle apparatus, a plurality of high pressure type compressors are provided having a casing held with a lubricating oil in which the discharging tube and suction tube of these compressors are mutually connected.  In the prior art, an imbalance occurs between an amount of lubricating oil discharged from each compressor in a state to be mixed in a refrigerant and an amount of lubricating oil returned back to the respective compressor and sometimes there will occur an oil shortage in the compressors.  If such oil shortage occurs, the oil is interrupted in sliding motion parts of the compressor, thus exerting a bad effect on the service life of the compressor.<br>
In order to handle such an unfavorable situation, a refrigerating cycle apparatus has been proposed (for example, JPN PAT APPLN KOKOKU PUBLICATION NO. 3197768) in which an oil balancing tube is connected to a<br>
suction tube of an associated compressor to allow the oil to be returned back to the associated compressor.<br>
Further, a refrigerating cycle apparatus has also been proposed (for example, JPN PAT APPLN KOKAI PUBLICATION NO. 2002-242833) in which a single collection tube is connected through an electronic opening/closing valve to a corresponding oil balancing tube connected to a respective compressor and the collecting tube is branch-connected to suction tubes of the respective compressors.<br>
In the refrigerating cycle apparatus where the oil balancing tube is connected to the suction tube of the associated compressor to allow the oil to be returned back. to the associated compressor, the oil balancing tubes involve a complex connection.  In the case of three or rnore compressors, when one of these compressors fails, an oil supply cannot be effected between the defective compressor and the compressor on the oil balancing tube-connected side.<br>
In the refrigerating cycle apparatus where a single collection tube is connected through an electronic opening/closing valve to the corresponding oil balancing tube connected to each compressor and the collection tube is branch-connected to the corresponding suction tube of the compressor, a now operating compressor and now stopped compressor are run in a mixed state and, in this case, the electronic valve is<br>
so cont rolled as to prevent an oil from being returned f rom the now operating compressor toward the now stopped compressor.  It is, therefore, necessary to provide expensive electronic valves corresponding in number to the compressors and a high cost is involved.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In cme aspect of the present invention, a refrigerating cycle apparatus is provided which can ensure a simpler structure in spiţe of the number of compressors involved, reduce costs, and eliminate an oil shortage positively and quickly in the respective compressors.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a refrigerating cycle apparatus equipped with a plurality of high pressure type compressors having a casing held with an oil, and having a discharge tube connected to a high pressure side tube and a suction tube connected to a low pressure side tube, the refrigerating cycle apparatus comprising:<br>
a plurality of first oil balancing tubes configured to allow a flowing-in of an excess portion of the oil held in the casing of the respective compressor;<br>
a first pressure reducing device configured to be rnounted on the respective oil balancing tube;<br>
a gas/liquid separator configured to allow a flowing-in of the oil in the respective oil balancing<br>
tube;<br>
a second oil balancing tube configured to be connected from the gas/liquid separator toward the respective suction tube;<br>
a second pressure reducing device configured to be mounted on the respective second oil balancing tube;<br>
a bypass tube configured to be connected between the high pressure side tube and the gas/liquid separator; and<br>
a third pressure reducing device configured to be mounted on the bypass tube.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
FIG. l is a view showing an arrangement of a first embodiment;<br>
FIG. 2 is a view showing an arrangement of a second embodiment;<br>
FIG. 3 is a view showing an arrangement of a third embodiment; and<br>
FIG. 4 shows a flowchart for explaining the operation of the third embodiment.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [l j With reference to FIG. l, an explanation will be made below about a first embodiment of the invention.<br>
A re frigerating cycle apparatus l is comprised of an air conditioner comprising an outdoor unit 2 and an indoor unit 3.  The outdoor unit 2 comprises compressors 4a, 4b, an oil separator 7, a four-way<br>
valve 9, an outdoor heat exchanger 10, a liquid tank 11, an aocumulator 16, an outdoor fân 20, an outdoor control section 50, inventers 51, 52, and so on.  The indoor unit 3 comprises an electronic expansion valve 13, an indoor heat exchanger 14, an indoor fân 30, an indoor control section (not shown) and so on.  The outdoor unit 2 and indoor unit 3 are connected by a liquid tube 12 and gas tube 15.<br>
The outdoor control section 50 controls the operat ion of the outdoor unit 2.  The inverters 51 and<br>
52	rectify the voltage of a commercial AC power supply<br>
53	and convert the rectified voltage to an AC voltage<br>
of frequencies corresponding to an instruction of<br>
the outdoor control section 50 and output it.  The<br>
compressors 4a and 4b are of a variable capacity type<br>
and are driven by the outputs of the inverters 51<br>
and 52.<br>
(Explanation on the Tube Arrangement Around the Compressors)<br>
The compressors 4a, 4b are of a high pressure type such that, during their operation, the pressure becomes higher in their casing.  An oil L for lubrication is held in the casing.  Discharge tubes 5a and 5b are connected to the refrigerant discharge outlets of the compressors 4a and 4b and then connected to a high pressure side tube 6.  Check valves 51a and 51b are provided on the discharge tubes 5a and 5b,<br>
respectively.  Suction tubes 18a and 18b are connected to the refrigerant suction inlets of the compressors 4a and 4b, respectively, and connected to a low pressure side tube 17.  To the suction tubes 18a and 18b are connected suction cups 19a and 19b, respectively. (Explanat: ion on Parts Around an Oil Balancing Circuit)<br>
An explanation will now be made below about the oil balancing circuit.  First balancing tubes 41a and 41b are connected at their one end to a predetermined height position on the sidesurfaces of the compressors 4a and 4b.  At these oil balancing tubes 41a and 41b are provided check valves 42a and 42b and, for example, capillary tubes 43a, 43b servirig as a first pressure reducing device.  First temperatura sensors Tla, Tlb are provided on the downstream side of the capillary tubes 43a, 43b.  The oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b are collectively connected at the other terminal to the buffer tank 44 serving as a gas/liquid separator. The buffer tank 44 has the function of effecting a separat ion into a gas and liguid and temporarily stores any excess oil L flowing from the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b.<br>
One end of a second oil balancing tube 45 is connected to the bottom of the buffer tank 44 and the other end of the second oil balancing tube 45 is branched into two oil balancing tubes 45a and 45b and connected to the suction tubes 18a and 18b.  On one end<br><br>
side of the second balancing tube 45 is mounted a third temperature sensor T2 which detects a temperature of the oil L flowing out of the buffer tank 44.  For example, capillary tubes 46a, 46b serving as a second pressure reducing device are provided on the oil baiancinq tubes 45a, 45b.<br>
A bypass tube 47 is connected between the high pressure side tube 6 and the buffer tank 44 and, for example, a capillary tube 48 serving as a third pressure reducing device is provided at the bypass tube 47.  A third temperature sensor T3 is mounted in a downstream side of the capillary tube 48 at the bypass tube 47.<br>
11 i s to be noted that the buffer tank 44 has a Larger diameter than the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b, oil balancing tubes 45, 45a, 45b and bypass tube 47. (Conditions of the Capillary Tube)<br>
The resistances of the capillary tube 46a, 46b at the oil balancing tubes 45a, 45b are smaller than those of the capillary tubes 43a, 43b at the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b and that of the capillary tube 48 at the bypass tube 47.  Thus, the oil L in the buffer tank 44 flows more easily toward the oil balancing tubes 45a, 45b. (Explanation on the Oil Separator and Oil Return Tube)<br>
Oil return tubes 71, 72 are connected between the oil separator tube 7 and the oil balancing tube 45.<br>
The oil return tube 71 has its one end connected to a predeterrnined height position on the sidesurface of the oil separator 7.  A capillary tube 73 is provided at the oil return tube 71.  The oil L in the oil separator 7 stored at a higher position than the connection position of the oil return tube 71 flows into the oil return tube 71 and then through the capillary tube 73 into the oil balancing tube 45.  The oil L flowing into the capillary tube 45 is branched into the oil bălanei rig tubes 45a, 45b flows through the capillary tubes 46a, 46b into the suction tubes 18a, 18b and is sucked into the compressors 4a, 4b together with the refrigerant circulated through the refrigerating cycle.<br>
The oil return tube 72 is connected below the oil separator 7.  At the oil return tube 72, an oil opening/closing valve 74 and capillary tube 75 are provided.<br>
(Explanat. ion on the refrigerant flow in the refrigerating cycle)<br>
When the compressors 4a, 4b are operated, the refrigerants discharged from the compressors 4a, 4b flow through the discharge tube 5a, 5b into the high pressure side tube 6 and, by the high pressure side tube 6, the refrigerant flows into the oil separator 7 where the refrigerant and oil L are separated.  The refrigerant in the oil separator 7 flows through the four-way valve 9.<br>
The refrigerent flowing through the four-way valve 9 iiows at a cooling operation time into the outdoor heat exchanger 10 where a heat exchanger with the outdoor air is made to allow condensation (liquefaction).  The refrigerant passing through the outdoor heat exchanger 10 sequesntially flows through the liquid tank 11, a pack valve 21a, a liquid tube 12 and a pack valve 21c into the indoor unit 3.  The refrigerant flowed through the indoor unit 3 flows through the expansion valve 13 into the indoor heat exchanger 14 where a heat exchange with the indoor air is made to effect vaporization.  The refrigerant passing through the indoor heat exchanger 14 sequen-tially flows through a pack valve 21d, gas tube 15 and pack valve 21b into the outdoor unit 2.  The refrigerant flowed into the outdoor unit 2 flows through the four-way valve 9 into the accumulator 16 and, from the accumulator 16, through the low pressure side tube 17 and suction tubes 18a, 18b into the compressors 4a, 4b.<br>
At a heating operation time, the four-way valve 9 îs switched to allow the refrigerant to flow in an opposite direct ion. (Flow of the Oil in the Oil Balancing Circuit)<br>
If the oil levels in the casings of the compressors 4a, 4b are higher than the connection positions of the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b, the oil<br><br>
Ii exceed.i.ng the connection position level flows as an excess oil port ion into the oil balancing tubes 4 la, 41b.  The oil L flowed into the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b flows through the capillary tubes 43a, 43b into the buffer tank 44.  Into the buffer tank 44, a higher piessure refrigerant gas of a very small amount flows f rom the high pressure side tube 6 through the bypass tube 47.  By a pressure applied through the bypass tube 47 and a suction pressure applied from the suction tubes 18a, 18b through the oil balancing tubes 45, 45b and oil balancing tube 45, the oil L flowed into the buffer tank 44 flows out from the oil balancing tube 45 and, from there, is branched to the oil balancing tubes 45a, 45b. The branched oil is flowed through the capillary tubes 46a, 46b into the suction tubes 18a, 18b.  The oil L flowed into the suction tubes 18a, 18b, together with the refrigerant circulated through the refrigerating cycle, is sucked into the compressors 4a, 4b through the suction tubes 19a, 19b.<br>
There are sometimes cases where an oil level imbalance will occur between the casings of the compressors 4a and 4b, such as where the oil level in the caş irig of the compressor 4a is higher than the connection position of the oil balarice tube 41a while, on the other hand, the oil level in the casing of the compressor 4b is lower than the connection position of<br><br>
the oil balance tube 41b.  In this case, the oil L tlows in the oil balancing tube 41a on the compressor 4a side while, on the other hand, a higher pressure refrigerent gas flows into the oil balance tube 4b on the compressor 4b side.  The flowed oil L and refrigerant gas are collected into the buffer tank 44. The collected gas L and refrigerant gas are mutually separated in the buffer tank 44 and, when flowing out of the buffer tank 44, flow in a combined state into the oil balancing tube 45.  The oil and refrigerant fiowed in the combined state into the oil balancing tube 45 are equally branched into the oil tubes 45a, 45b by the resistance actions of the capillary tubes 46a, 46b.<br>
By doing so, the oil is moved from the compressor 4a ori a greater oil level side into the compressor 4b on the smaller oil level side and the oil surface levels in the casings of the compressors 4a, 4b are quickly balanced.<br>
On the other hand, the refrigerants from the compressors 4a, 4b are discharged and, with this, part of the oi îs L in the compressors 4a and 4b flow out into the discharge tubes 5a, 5b.  The discharged oil L flows out from the high pressure side tube 6 into the oil separator 7.  The oil separator 7 separates the oil L from the refrigerant gas and held therein. Of the oil L held in the oil separator 7, an oil<br><br>
corresponding to a portion exceeding the connection position of the oil return tube 71 flows into the oil return tube 71.  The oil L flowed into the oil return tube 71 i s returned through the oil balancing tube 45 arid oil balancing tubes 45a, 45b back to the c ompr e s s or s 4 a, 4 b.<br>
Where the oil surface levels in the casings of the compressors 4a, 4b are both lowered, the opening/ closing valve 74 on the oil return tube 72 is opened and, by doing so, the oil in the oil separator 7 is returned through the oil balancing tube 45 and oil balancinq tubes 45a and 45b back to the compressors 4a and 4b. (Effects of Buffer Tank 44)<br>
Where either one of the compressors 4a, 4b is stopped, for example, the compressor 4a is stopped, even i f the oil L flowed during operation frorn the compressor 4b into the oil balancing tube 41b tries to flow through the buffer tank 44 and oil balancing tube 41a into a now stopped compressor 4a, such a flow is preventeci by the check valve 42a.<br>
I f the checking action of the check valve 42b is not completely ensured and a very small flow of the oil L from the oil balancing tube 41a toward the compressor 4a side may occur, an amount of oil L in a now operated compressor 4b is gradually decreased and the compressor 4b soon becomes short of oil.<br><br>
However, the buffer tank 44 is present between the oil balancing tube 41b and the oil balancing tube 41a and, sinee, in the buffer tank 44, a lighter weight refrigerant moves upward and a heavier weight oil L downward, it is possible to previously prevent such inconvenience that the oil L flowing from a now operated compressor 4b into the oil balancing tube 41b fiows into a now stopped compressor 4a through the buffer tank 44 and oil balancing tube 41a.  It is, therefore, possible to prevent any unwanted movement of the oil l, f rom the now operated compressor 4b to the now stopped compressor 4a.<br>
It j s, therefore, nor necessary to adopt an expensive flow-checking electronic valve which might be required in a convenţional technique.  It is therefore also possible to avoid any costs associated therewith.<br>
Since the oil balancing tubes 41a and 41b are so constructed as to be collectively connected to the buffer tank 44, more compressors, if needed, can be constructed without adopting a complex structure, and it is also possible to avoid any complex designing.<br>
Since the pressure of a higher pressure refrigerant discharged from the compressors 4a, 4b is appiied through the bypass tube 47 to the buffer tank 44, the distributive supply of the oil L from the buffer tank 44 to the compressors 4a, 4b can be positlvely and quickly completed while allowing the<br><br>
mount.lng position of the buf fer tank 44 to be set in a freer and easier fashion.<br>
Even ii, due to a malfunction of the compressor 4a, a back-up operation is performed by the compressor 4b, it is possible to prevent any unrequired movement of the oil L from a now operated compressor 4b to the malfurictioning compressor 4a and hence to constantly perform a back-up operation by the compressor 4b. With respect to a lowered ability caused by the malfunctioning compressor 4a, it is possible to back up the apparatus by a variable capacity operation of the compressor 4b by the use of the inverter 52.  Since the compressors 4a, 4b are both inverter-driven in a variable capacity mode, even if one of these fails, L t. i s possible to perform a back-up operation in a variable capacity mode. [2] Second Embodiment<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, an oil tank 60 is provided in place of the buffer tank 44 in the first embodiment. One end of an oil balancing tube 45 is connected, at a predetermined height, to a sidesurface of the oil tank Of an oil L held in the oil tank 60, an oil portion exceeding a connection position of the oil balancing tube 45 flows as an excess portion into the oil balancing tube 45.  The oil L flowed into the oil balancing tube 45 flows into suction tubes 18a and 18b<br><br>
through nil balancing tubes 45a and 45b and capillary tubes 46a and 4 6b and is, together with a refrigerant circuiated through a refrigerating cycle, drawn into the compressors 4a and 4b. (Effect. of t h e Oil Tank)<br>
Although the oil tank 60 has basically the same function as that of the buffer tank 44 in the first embodiment, it has the feature that an amount of oil L held is qreater than that of the buffer tank 44.<br>
That. is, since more than a predetermined amount of oil L cart be held in the oil tank 60, even if an amount of oil L flowing out from the compressors 4a, 4b is i ne reaşed due to a change in an operation state, etc., the oil L cari be quickly supplied to the compressors 4a, 4b wjthout delaying its increase.  The supply of the oil L from the oil tank 60 is quicker than in the case of supplying the oil L in an oil separator 7 through an oil return tube 71.<br>
The other structure, function and effects are the same as those in the first embodiment. [Third Embodiment]<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, an air conditioner comprises a plural!ty of outdoor units 2a, 2b and a plurality of indoor unlts 3.  The outdoor unit 2a has the same structure as the outdoor unit 2 of the second embodiment and has compressors 4a, 4b.  The outdoor un.i t 2b has the same structure as the outdoor 2 of the<br><br>
second embodiment and has compressors 4a, 4b.<br>
For respective outdoor units 2a, 2b, a first opening/closing valve VI is connected in parallel with a capi]lary tube 48 in a bypass tube 47.<br>
For the respective outdoor units 2a, 2b, a third oil balancing tube 61 is connected from the bottom of an oil tank 48 toward a low pressure side tube 17. Second and third opening/closing valves V2 and V3 are provided at the oil balancing tube 61.  Further, a series circuit of a capillary tube 33 and check valve 34 is connected in parallel with the opening/closing valve V2 in the oil balancing tube 61.<br>
Between those mutual connections at a position between the opening/closing valves V2 and V3 of the oil balancing tube 61 in the respective outdoor units 2a, 2b, a balancing tube 31 is connected through pack valves 21e, 21e.<br>
There are sometimes cases where, at the operation times of the two outdoor units 2a and 2b, an imbalance in their oil amounts will occur between these mutual outdoor units 2a and 2b; for example, an oil amount in the compressor of the outdoor unit 2a side is increased while, on the other hand, an oil amount in the compressor of the outdoor 2b side decreases. [Explanation on the Detection of the Oil Amount]<br>
I f the oil amount of the compressor in the respective outdoor units 2a and 2b is at a correct<br><br>
leve], ai; oil L flows in the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b and it flows into the oil tank 60.  And the oil L in the oil tank 60 flows into the oil balancing tube 45 and is supplied to the suction side of the respective compressors 4a, 4b.<br>
When an oil amount of the compressor in the outdoor units 2a, 2b becomes insufficient, a refriger-ant, not an oil L, flows into the oil balancing tube 41a, 41b and an oil surface level in the oil tank 60 is Jowered and, for this reason, the refrigerant flows f rom the oil tank 60 into the oil balancing tube 45.<br>
The temperature of the oil L or the refrigerant flowing into the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b is detected by a corresponding temperature sensor Tla, Tlb and the temperature of the oil L or the refrigerant flowing into the oil balancing tube 45 is detected by a temperature sensor T2.  The detection temperatures of the temperature sensors Tla, Tlb, T2 become higher when the oil L is passed than when the refrigerant is passed.  Further, the temperature of the refrigerant flowing through the bypass tube 47 is detected by a temperature sensor T3.<br>
As shown in the flowchart of FIG. 4, when two compressors 2a, 2b are operated (YES at step 101), an oil amount of a compressor in the outdoor units 2a and 2b is detected, for each predetermined time (for example, for each minute) based on detection<br><br>
tempera t. u res of the temperature sensors Tla, Tlb, T2, rF3 (step 102) .  In this case, it is to be noted that detection can proceed continuously, instead of only on a minute-by-minute basis.<br>
That; is, where the oil amounts of all the compres sors are at a correct level, an oil L flows into the oil balanoirig tubes 41a, 41b and 45 and the detection tempera tures of the temperature sensors Tla, Tlb, T2 become higher than the detection temperature (the temperature of the refrigerant flowing through the bypass tube 47) of the temperature sensor T3.  Then, the following relation is established, noting that a l&gt;/3 1&gt;0.<br>
Where the oil surface levels of all the compres-sors are t o o low, the refrigerant flows into the oil balancing tubes 41a, 41b and oil balancing tube 45 and the detection temperatures of the temperature sensors Tla, Tlb, T2 become lower than the detection temperature (the temperature of the refrigerant flowing through the bypass tube 47) of the temperature sensor T.3.  The following relation is thus established, where that a2
The oil amount in the respective compressor can be detected based on the relation of these detection<br><br>
tempera t tir e s .<br>
When, for example, an oil amount shortage is detected at, for example, the outdoor unit 2a of the outdoor units 2a and 2b (NO at step 103), the opening/closing valve V2 in the outdoor unit 2a is operied only during a predetermined time t (step 104) and the opening/closing valves VI, V3 in the outdoor unit. 2b are opened only during the same predetermined time period t (step 105).  And as an indicator that the opening/closing valves VI, V2 and V3 are opened, a flag f is set to "l" (step 106).<br>
By opening the opening/closing valves VI, V3 on an oil amount "not low" side, the oil L stored in the oil tank 60 of the outdoor unit 2b flows through the oil balancing tube 61 into a balancing tube 31.  By opening the opening/closing valve V2 in the outdoor unit 2a on ari oil amount "low" side, the oil L flowed into the balancinq tube 31 is led to the low pressure side tube 17 of the outdoor unit 2a.  The oil L led to the low pressure side tube 17 is drawn into the compressors 4a arid 4b.  Thus, the oil amount detection for each minute period conţinues.<br>
When the oil amount shortage of the outdoor unit 2a is not. detected (YES at step 103), if the flag f is "l" (YES at step 107), all the opening/closing valves VI, V2, V3 are closed (step 108) under the decision that the oil amount balance between the outdoor units<br><br>
2a and 2b is effected.<br>
After all the opening/closing valves VI, V2, V3 are closed, an opening/closing valve 74 in the outdoor unit 2b on the oil amount "not low" side is opened only during a predetermined period (step 109).  By opening the opening/closing valve 74, the oil L held in the oil separator 7 is replenished to the oil tank 60.  The flag f îs reset to "O" (step 110).<br>
As set out above, the oil tanks of the outdoor units 2a and 2b are shared by both of the outdoor units 2a, 2b.<br>
By ddjusting the predetermined time t for opening the opening/closing valves VI, V2, V3, an amount of oil L supplied from the oil tank 61 can be restricted solely to that which is necessary.  By doing so, it is possible to avoid the situation such that an oil shortage still occurs in the outdoor unit on the oil supply side.<br>
Where three or more compressors in one outdoor unit are mounted, the number of temperature sensors TI is accordingly increased and, by doing so, similar processes of oil amount detection and oil amount balancinq can be performed.<br>
The other arrangement, function and effects of the third embodiment are the same as those of the second embodiment.<br>
Although, in the third embodiment, the detection<br><br>
temperatura of the temperature sensor T3 mounted at the bypass tube 47 is used for oil detection, use may be rnade of, in place of the temperature sensor T3, a temperature sensor mounted on at least one of discharge tubes Sa, 5b of the compressors 4a, 4b and, in this case, the detection temperature of the temperature sensor îs used for oil amount detection.  Or a pressure sensor Pd may be mounted on a high pressure side tube 6 and, in this case, the refrigerent temperature is taken from the detection pressure of the pressure sensor so as to use it for oil amount detection.<br>
Atthough the detection temperature of the temperature sensor T2 on the oil balancing tube 45 is used for oil amount detection, the oil temperature at the oil balancing tube 45 may be taken from a temperature sensor T3 on the bypass tube 47, without the use of the temperature sensor T2 and, in this case, the detected temperature is employed for oil amount detect i on.<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the above-mentioned embodiments and various changes or modifications of the present invention may be made without departing from the essence of the present invention.<br>
