				<td>This    invention     relates    to    an	improved    process     for   the<br>
preparation     of   stable    phycocyanin	.      The    present     invention<br>
particularly   relates   to  production    of stable   phycocyanin    using   a<br>
high   osmotic    and     protein    stabilizing       agent    in combination     with<br>
antimicrobials      or   antioxidants      or	a    mixture     thereof.        The<br>
phycocyanin    thus   obtained    by  this	method    finds   application    in<br>
food  and  beverages    as   colourant.<br>
Food colours are of the utmost importance of the food industry because of the powerful influence they exert over consumers' reactions to food products. Though natural colours have become increasingly popular over recent years, they have their limitations in processed food - with stability at the forefront. Natural colours are generally more sensitive to heat, light and pH than their synthetic counterparts. Therefore, they are added at the lowest possible temperatures and as late as possible during processing. Moreover, natural '""colours offer maximum stability at specific pH levels. In many applications water soluble colours are preferred (Rush, S. 1986, Food Ingredients &amp; Processing International p23-27). In essence the natural colours are far more prone to deterioration than synthetics (Food ingredients and Processing International 1988 p.16-20).<br>
Despite these shortcomings, the demand for replacing synthetic colours with natural colours has been growing over last decade and will continue to grow. Due to consumer demand and pressures new sources of natural colours with better stability<br><br>
and   tinctorial    strength    are  being   explored.      The   instability    of the   common    natural    colour   has   been   studied    to   seek   the   means   of stabilization.      The  methods    employed   for improving   the  stability of    natural     colours     include     formulation      with,    .addition      of antioxidant     and    addition    of   a   combined     antioxidant     and    an emulsifier   etc.   (Food   Marketing   &amp; Technology    1994   8(3)   8-10). Phycocyanin    is  a  useful   colourant    which   is   recently   attracting attention     as   one   of many   safe   biocolourants     for processed    foods.<br>
&amp;<br>
Patents on the use of algal colours mainly phycocyanin from Spirulina platensis and phycoerythrin from Phorphyridium, in foods include colouring of fermented milk products such as Yoghurt (JP 1979,^95770), ices (JP 1987, 06691), chewing gum (JP 1979 138156), soft drinks (JP 1979, 79 -76867) and alcoholic drinks (JP 1980, 077890). Phycocyanin colouration is unique -however it is very unstable in solutions during storage. On standing in solutions the blue colour fades and the original colour can never be recovered from the decolourised solution as the colour change is irreversible.<br>
Phycocyanin is the main light harvesting pigment in the blue<br>
green algae (Cyanophyta). Phycocyanin is built up of bilins<br>
which are open chain tetrapyrroles, covalently linked via one or<br>
two thioether links to the cysteine residues in the apoproteins<br>
(Killika, S.D. O'Carra P. and Murphy, R.F. 1980, Biochem J. 187,<br>
311-320).	The main bilin chromophore is known as<br>
phycocyanobilin.       The   apoproteins     are  built   of equimolar    amounts of two   dissimilar    subunits    (alpha    and   beta),    these    subunits    have molecular   masses    in  the   range   of 17,000   -   20,000   Da.     Each<br>
subunit is linked to one or more bilins. Phycocyanin can constitute a major portion of the algal cell protein. This pigment is highly soluble in water but lyophilization reduces the solubility. Powdered phycocyanin is-, stable during storage but it is not easily soluble. Moreover a convenient method for supplying the water soluble colourant for the use of food and cosmetic industries would be as concentrated solutions. The concentrations of this colourant required to colour food or cosmetics is 0.1% w/w (Arad. S.M. &amp; Yaron, A. 1992, Trends in Food Science and Technology (3) 92-97).<br>
Procedures      currently     reported      for    the     preservation      of phycocyanin   are the  following.<br>
Phycocyanin    when  extracted    from cyanophycean-- alga consists    of a protein   plus   the   chromophore    linked   by  a  peptide    linkage.     In many   applications     the   protein   becomes    denatured    and   precipitates which    also    degrades     the    colour.        To    avoid    this    kind    of degradation    the   phycocyanin    has   to  be  stabilised.<br>
Reference   may be made  to Japanese    patent    (JP   1980,   077890; JP  1978,   53101   575)   wherein   the  phycocyanin    is stabilised      at  low pH  and   high   alcohol   concentrations      by   pronase    hydrolysis    of  the proteins     in   the    phycobiliproteins.      The    drawback     is   pronase hydrolysis      of    phycocyanin       to     increase      the      stability      of phycocyanin    will remove   the   protein   part   and   only   the   prosthetic group,    Nthe  tetrapyrrole    group1   can  be extracted    into   alcohol.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent (JP 1979, 79 076 867) wherein to prevent precipitation of phycocyanin, gelatin was added which can stabilize the phycocyanin solution. The drawback is that addition of gelatin to phycocyanin can prevent the precipitation of phycocyanin but it may not be effective against the oxidative degradation of the protein part of the pigment and also to the microbial growth which often develops in aqueous solution of phycocyanin.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent (JP 1979 138156) wherein addition of antioxidants such as Ascorbate and erythroborate are described for stabilization of phycocyanin. The drawback is that in solutions phycocyanin will get precipitated during storage which will affect the shelf life and therefore the addition of antiocidants alone is not helpful to prevent the deterioration.<br>
The main object is to provide an improved process for the preparation of stable phycocyanin.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein a high osmotic and protein stabilizing agent in combination with antimicrobials or antioxidants is used for the stabilization and prevention of precipitation of phycocyanin - a natural blue colourant which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
The phycocyanin used in present invention has been obtained from cyanophycean algae collected from water bodies of Mysore.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a stable phycocyanin characterized in that blending the said phycocyanin with synergistic composition comprising a high osmotic and protein stabilizing agent , an antimicrobial agent and an antioxidant, said process comprises of blending phycocyanin in the range 2.5% -15% with 25 - 75% high osmotic and protein stabilizing agent glycerol and 0.02 - 0.2% of antimicrobials selected from sodium benzoate, potassium bisulphate and 0.02 - 0.2% of antioxidants selected from L - cysteine, mannitol, at a temperature ranging 27° to 45°C , at least for 3 minutes to get stable phyconyanin.<br><br>
glycerol   and   0.02   -   0.2%   of  antimicrobials     selected    from   sodium benzoate,    potassium    bisulphite   or    Q.02  -   0.2%   of antioxidants selected    from   L-cysteine,    mannitol    below   the   temperature     of 45 ^C at   least   for 3 minutes    to   get   a  stable   phycocyanin<br>
The     high   osmotic    and   protein   stabilising    agent   used   in the present   invention   has  prevented    the  precipitation    of phycocyanin protein     in   the    suspension      and    the    high    osmotic     character prevents    microbial   spoilage. /=» The   addition   of antimicrobial    and antioxidants      enhanced     the    stability     and    keeping     quality     of phycocyanin    through    the   synergistic    action.   The  degradation    of the  protein   in the  phycocyanin    is inhibited   by  the   high  osmotic and    protein     stabilizing     property     of   glycerol     and    oxidative degration    is   inhibited    by   the   presence    of antioxidants     or   the presence    of antimicrobials     prevents    the   microbial    degradation. The    main    type    of   degradation      involved    in   the    storage     of phycocaynin    is oxidative    the   combination     of high   osmotic    and protein    stabilizing    agent    and   antioxidant     will  contribute     more stabilizing       affect.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br>

Stock solution of 2.5% (w/v) phycocyanin was prepared in 25% glycerol(v/v). The phycocyanin solution in 25% glyceroi was divided into two groups and stored at ambient (27+2°C) and refrigerated (8il°C) temperature. Stability studies<br><br>
of the   pigment    were   carried   out   as   described    here.   An  aliquote    of the   sample   from   the   stock   phycocyanin    solution      was   suitably diluted,    the   phycocyanin     content    (mg/ml)     was   determined    by measuring    the   optical   density   at   620  and   650nm   using   a  glass cuvette    with   a   1cm   light   path    in  a   Shimadzu    Spectrophotometer model   UV160A.

The  colour  stability   of the   pigment   was   followed   by measuring    the tristimulus      values     every    week.     The    preservation      rate    was calculated    from   the   percentage    of the   amount    of pigment    retained in the   sample   at  the  end  of the  experimental    period.

Stock   solution   of 6.0%   (w/v)   phycocyanin   was  prepared   in 25% glycerol(v/v)    containing    potassium    bisulphite   at  a concentration of 2000   ppm.   The   phycocyanin     solution    in  25%   glycerol   with potassium    bisulphite   was  divided   into   two   groups   and  stored   at ambient   (27 + 2°C) and refrigerated   (8il°C) temperature.    Stability studies    of the   pigment    were   carried   out   as   described   here.   An aliquote    of the   sample   from  the   stock   phycocyanin    solution      was suitably    diluted,   the   phycocyanin    content    (mg/ml)    was   determined by measuring    the   optical   density   at  620  and  650nm   using   a glass cuvette    with   a   1cm   light   path   in  a  Shimadzu    Spectrophotometer model   UV160A.
