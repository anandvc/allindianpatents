TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to extruded foam products, and more<br>
particularly, to polymer foams that have an enlarged average cell size and possess no<br>
ozone depleting potential and a low global warming potential. A method of forming such<br>
polymer foams is also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Foamed resinous structures are useful in a wide variety of applications such as<br>
thermal insulation, in cushions, as packaging, and as adsorbents. Extruded foams are<br>
generally made by melting a polymtir together with any desired additives to create a<br>
polymer melt. A blowing agent is mixed with the polymer melt at an appropriate<br>
temperature and pressure to produce a foamable gel mixture. The foamable gel mixture is<br>
then cooled and extruded into a zone of reduced pressure, which results in a foaming of the<br>
gel and the formation of the desired extruded foam product.<br>
Traditional blowing agents used for extruded foam products include<br>
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hycrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). One of the<br>
advantages of both CFC and HCFC blowing agents is their high solubility in a polymer<br>
melt during the manufacturing process. Higher blowing agent solubility promotes a<br>
reduction in viscosity when the blowing agent is mixed with the polymer melt. Id turn,<br>
lower viscosity leads to lower energy requirements for mixing. On the other hand, a major<br>
disadvantage to these traditional blowing agents is that an increasing number of<br>
governments worldwide have mandated the elimination of CFC and HCFC blowing agents<br>
due to growing environmental concerns. CFCs, and many other halocarbons, have come<br>
to be recognized as serious global environmental threats due to their ability to cause<br>
stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming. The ozone depletion and global<br>
warming impact of chemicals such as CFCs and HCFCs are measured by the ozone<br>
depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) respectively.<br>
In view of the mandatory phase out of blowing agents with a high ODP and a high<br>
GWP, there has been a movement to replace the conventional blowing agents in favor of<br>
more environmentally friendly blowing agents, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and<br>
CO2 in insulating foam applications. Although HCFCs provide a superior thermal barrier<br>
compared to CO2, the chlorine present in the HCFCs still possesses a small ozone<br>
depletion potential. Additionally, over time, the chlorofluorocarbon gas phase in the foam<br>
is released into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the insulative value of the foam and<br>
potentially contributing to the global warming potential. Further, each of these non-<br>
conventional blowing agents leads to a different cell size and morphology depending on<br>
the particular blowing agent chosen. Unfortunately, the cell sizes of the foam produced by<br>
these generally environmentally friisndly blowing agents are too small to provide an<br>
acceptable insulative value to the foamed product.<br>
Previously, there have been attempts in the art to utilize more environmentally<br>
friendly blowing agents or to modify the conventional HCFC blowing agents to reduce the<br>
ODP and OWP of the foam produced while maintaining the thermal insulation value of the<br>
foam. Some examples of these processes/compounds are described below.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,489,407 to Suh et al. describes a process for making a closed-<br>
cell, alkenyl aromatic polymer foam that has an enlarged cell size. The polymer is<br>
preferably polystyrene. For environmental reasons, the blowing agent is preferably an<br>
inorganic blowing agents such as CO2, nitrogen, argon, water, helium, or air. The<br>
composition used to form the foam includes a substantially non-waxy cell size enlarging<br>
agent. The cell size enlarging agent has diverse chemical structures, and includes<br>
compounds such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol with a molecular weight<br>
of 1200 or more, salts of n-tallow p-tunino dipropionate, amine oxides, imidaxoline, fatty<br>
acid alkanolamides of C12 to Cig, n-alkyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, ethoxylated linear<br>
alcohols, dioctyl ester sodium suLfbcounic acid, poiyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate,<br>
diglycol laurate, fluoro-chemical surfactants, coco betaine, aqueous emulsions and fluids<br>
of silicone compounds (for example, dimethyl polysiloxane). The composition may<br>
optionally contain a nucleating agent (for example, inorganic substances such as talc, clay,<br>
and/or calcium carbonate) to control ihe size of the foam cells.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,912,279 to Hammel et al. discloses a closed cell foam and a<br>
foaming agent that utilizes a hydrogen-containing halo-carbon blowing agent (for example,<br>
HCFC-22) in combination with a hydrogen bond forming blocking agent (for example,<br>
organic ether, ester, or ketone). The jiresence of the blocking agent reduces the escape of<br>
the blowing agent and entry of air into the foam to maintain a low thermal conductivity<br>
over a longer period of time. It is asserted that the blocking agent is capable of creating<br>
hydrogen bonds with the blowing agent, which dramatically reduces the permeation rate of.<br>
the halo-carbon blowing agent out of the insulation foam (thereby reducing the global<br>
warming potential).<br>
Hammel et al. also disclose a closed cell resinous foam that is formed utilizing an<br>
environmentally friendly and low permeable polyfluorocarbon blowing agent The<br>
blowing agent includes more than about 70 weight percent of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane<br>
(HFC-134). The remaining 30 weight percent is formed of blowing agents that are devoid<br>
of halogen substituents other than fluorine. The foam body may be formed of any<br>
thermoplastic resin (for example, polystyrene, polyethylene, or polypropylene). The<br>
blowing agents typically contain 1 to 2 carbon atoms and are substantially non-flammable,<br>
have zero ozone depletion potential, and a low halocarbon global warming potential.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,787,580 to Chonde et al. discloses a multi-modal thermoplastic<br>
and thermally insulating polymer fosum that has a distribution of large and small cells in a<br>
substantial absence of water by using a blowing agent stabilizer. A preferred blowing<br>
agent is selected from non-ozone depleting blowing agents such as CO2, hydrocarbons,<br>
and hydrofluorocarbons, but not water. The blowing agent stabilizer creates domains of<br>
concentrated blowing agent that produce large cells within the foam. Blowing agent<br>
molecules that are not associated with the blowing agent stabilizer produce small cells.<br>
Suitable blowing agent stabilizers include polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG ethers,<br>
polyethylene oxide grafted polystyreite/maleic anhydride random copolymers, and ethylene<br>
glycol grafted polyurethane random copolymers. The foams may be in the form of planks<br>
or sheets, and are particularly useful us thermally insulating articles because they<br>
assertedly have high insulating valuer.<br>
Despite these previous attempts to reduce the ODP and GWP, there remains a need<br>
in the art to achieve an extruded polymer foam that has an increased cell size when non-<br>
HCFC blowing agents are used, that maintains the positive physical properties of<br>
conventional extruded polystyrene foldms, and mat meets the stringent requirements for a<br>
reduction in the global warming potential and ozone depletion potential.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition that is used to form<br>
extruded foams having an increased cell size. The composition includes a foamable <br>
polymer material, at least one blowing agent, and at least one cell size enlarging agent<br>
The foamable polymer material is preferably an alkenyl aromatic polymer material such as<br>
polystyrene The foamable polymer material may be present in the composition in an<br>
amount from about 60% to about 95% by weight. The blowing agent may be present in<br>
the composition in an amount from about 2.0% to about 18.0% by weight and include<br>
inorganic blowing agents, organic Mowing agents, and chemical blowing agents. The<br>
blowing agent utilized in the inventive composition is preferably selected such mat the<br>
composition has a zero ozone depletion and low global warming potential. Examples of<br>
such blowing agents include any inorganic blowing agent and/or non-hydrogenated<br>
chlorofluorocarbon (non-HCFCs), such as carbon dioxide, argon, water, air, nitrogen,<br>
and/or helium. It is to be appreciated that the blowing agent utilized in the inventive<br>
formulation does not have a high global warming potential and has a low or zero ozone<br>
depleting potential. The cell size enlarging agent may be present in the composition in an<br>
amount from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight. Suitable examples of cell size enlarging<br>
agents used in the composition include ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene methyl<br>
acrylate (EMA), polyethylene ethoxylate copolymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and<br>
combinations thereof. The cell size enlarging agent permits the formation of a foam with<br>
large cell sizes that are desirable in older to achieve a high insulation value (R-value) and<br>
to optimize the physical properties of the final foamed product In addition, the cell size<br>
enlarging agent provides an increased cell size to the foamed product without detracting<br>
from the physical and thermal properties of a conventional foamed product formed without<br>
a cell size enlarging agent. Additionally, the inventive composition may contain a ¦<br>
nucleating agent in an amount up to about 1.0% by weight and a fire retarding agent in an<br>
amount up to about 1.0% by weight Optional additives such as plasticizing agents,<br>
pigments, elastomers, extrusion aids, aintioxidants, fillers, infrared attenuating agents,<br>
antistatic agents, and/or UV absorbers may be included in amounts necessary to obtain<br>
desired characteristics of the foamable gel or resultant extruded foam products.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a monomodal thermoplastic<br>
polymer foam formed from the composition described above. The average cell size of the<br>
inventive foam and foamed products produced by the inventive composition is about SO<br>
microns to about 500 microns. The cellular foam produced with the inventive composition<br>
is a substantially closed cellular foam with an average density of about 1.0 lbs/ft3 to about<br>
5.0 lbs/ft3. It is desirable that not more than about 5% of the cells are open cells or<br>
otherwise "non-closed" cells. The closed cell structure of the foam helps to increase the<br>
R-value of a formed, foamed insulation product. Another aspect of the extruded inventive<br>
foams is that they possess a high level of dimensional stability. For example, the<br>
dimensional stability in any direction may be about 5% or less. The extruded inventive<br>
foam can be used to make insulation products such as rigid insulation boards, insulation<br>
foam, and packaging products.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a thermoplastic polymer<br>
foam insulative product that is formed of a molded, extruded polymeric foam having the<br>
composition described above, namely, a foamable polymer material, at least one blowing<br>
agent, and one or more cell size enlarging agents. The average cell size of the insulation<br>
product is about SO microns to about 500 microns. Substantially all of the cells in the<br>
extruded insulative product are closed cell. It is desirable that not more than about 5.0%<br>
of the cells are open cells or otherwise "non-closed" cells. It is to be appreciated that the<br>
closed cell structure of the foam helps to increase the R-value of the formed, foamed<br>
insulation product. The R-value per inch of the insulation product may be from about 4.0<br>
to about 8.0. Examples of extruded foam insulative products formed in accordance with<br>
the present invention include insulation products such as rigid insulation boards, insulation<br>
foam, and packaging products.<br>
Rigid residential insulation boards of the present invention may range from about<br>
0.5 to about 10 inches thick and are typically available in sizes (width x length) of 24" x<br>
96"; 48" x 96"; 48" x 108". The boards are suitable for use in residentials applications<br>
including exterior walls, foundation wails, interior basement walls, and under the slab of<br>
the basement floor. The foam boards of the present invention may also be used in<br>
roof/ceiling applications to add thermal or acoustical control on the underside of a roof<br>
deck or at the ceiling line.<br>
Foam boards of the present invention may be used for other applications including<br>
concrete decking, steel trusses, masonry cavity walls, steel stud/brick veneer wails, wood<br>
stud walls, and in concrete wall forming systems. The dimensions of the boards may be<br>
cut to fit the desired application and to meet building code specifications.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the enlarging agent increases the<br>
average cell size of the foamed product without detrimentally affecting the physical or<br>
thermal properties of the product.<br>
It is another advantage of the present invention that the composition of the present<br>
invention has a low global warming potential and little or no ozone depleting potential.<br>
It is yet another advantage of the present invention that the addition of the cell size<br>
enlargers requires no modification to existing manufacturing equipment and therefore no<br>
increase in manufacturing costs.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention mat the foams produced by the<br>
present composition have no toxicity to living creatures.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will<br>
appear more fully hereinafter from a consideration of the detailed description that follows.<br>
It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for illustrative purposes<br>
and are not to be construed as defining the limits of the invention.<br>

invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those<br>
described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the<br>
preferred methods and materials are described herein. In the drawings, the thickness of the<br>
lines, layers, and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. It is to be noted that like numbers<br>
found throughout the figures denote like elements. The terms "composition" and<br>
"formulation" may be used interchangeably herein. In addition, the terms "increased<br>
average cell size" and "enlarged average cell size" may be used interchangeably herein.<br>
Further, the terms "composition" anil "inventive composition" may be used<br>
interchangeably herein.<br>
The present invention relates to polymer extruded or expanded foams that contain a<br>
cell size enlarging agent that increases the average cell size of the foamed product. The<br>
foams may be formed into an insulation product such as building insulation or<br>
underground insulation (for example, highway, airport runway, railway, and underground<br>
utility insulation). The cell size enlarging agent increases the average cell size of the<br>
foamed product without detrimentally affecting the physical or thermal properties of the<br>
product formed. The composition used to form the expanded foams having an increased<br>
cell size includes a foamable polymer material, at least one blowing agent, and one or<br>
more cell size enlarging agents. The inventive composition is capable of forming a closed-<br>
cell foam material with an increased or enlarged average cell size compared to foams with<br>
no cell enlargers.<br>
The foamable polymer material is the backbone of the formulation and provides<br>
strength, flexibility, toughness, and durability to the final product The foamable polymer<br>
material is not particularly limited, at d generally, any polymer capable of being foamed<br>
may be used as the foamable polymer in the resin mixture. The foamable polymer material<br>
may be thermoplastic or thermoset. The particular polymer material may be selected to<br>
provide sufficient mechanical strength and/or the process utilized to form final foamed<br>
polymer products. In addition, the foamable polymer material is preferably chemically<br>
stable, that is, generally non-reactive, within the expected temperature range during<br>
formation and subsequent use in a polymeric foam. Non-limiting examples of suitable<br>
foamable polymer materials include alkenyl aromatic polymers, polyvinyl chloride (PVC),<br>
chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonates,<br>
polyisocyanurates, polyetherimides, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonates,<br>
polymethylmethacrylate, polyurethaaes, phenolics, polyolefins, styreneacrylonitrile,<br>
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, aery) ic/styrene/acrylonitrile block terpolymer (ASA),<br>
polysulfone, polyurethane, polyphenylenesulfide, acetal resins, polyamides, polyaramides,<br>
polyimides, polyacrylic acid esters, tiopolymers of ethylene and propylene, copolymers of<br>
styrene and butadiene, copolymers of vinylacetate and ethylene, rubber modified polymers,<br>
thermoplastic polymer blends, and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, the foamable polymer material is an alkenyl aromatic polymer material.<br>
Suitable alkenyl aromatic polymer materials include alkenyl aromatic homopolymers and<br>
copolymers of alkenyl aromatic compounds and copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
comonomers. In addition, the alkenyl aromatic polymer material may include minor<br>
proportions of non-alkenyl aromatic polymers. The alkenyl aromatic polymer material<br>
may be formed of one or more alkenyl aromatic homopolymers, one or more alkenyl<br>
aromatic copolymers, a blend of one or more of each of alkenyl aromatic homopolymers<br>
and copolymers, or blends thereof with a non-alkenyl aromatic polymer. Notwithstanding<br>
the components of the composition, the alkenyl aromatic polymer material may include<br>
greater than about 50 and preferably {greater than about 70 weight percent alkenyl aromatic<br>
monomeric units. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the alkenyl aromatic<br>
polymer material is formed entirely of alkenyl aromatic monomeric units.<br>
Examples of alkenyl aromatic polymers include, but are not limited to, those<br>
alkenyl aromatic polymers derived from alkenyl aromatic compounds such as styrene, a-<br>
methylstyrene, ethylstyrene, vinyl bettzene, vinyl toluene, chlorostyrene, and<br>
bromostyrene. A preferred alkenyl aromatic polymer is polystyrene. Minor amounts of<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated compounds such as C2 toCfi alkyl acids and esters,<br>
ionomeric derivatives, and C2 to C6 dienes may be copolymerized with alkenyl aromatic<br>
compounds. Non-limiting example:} of copolymerizable compounds include acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, mttleic acid, itaconic acid, acrylonitrile, maleic<br>
anhydride, methyl acrylate, ethyl aciylate, isobutyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate, vinyl acetate and butadiene. The foamed products may be formed<br>
substantially, of (for example, greater than 95 percent), and most preferably, formed<br>
entirely of polystyrene. The foamable polymer material may be present in the composition<br>
in an amount from about 60% to about 95% by weight, preferably in an amount from about<br>
80% to about 90 % by weight, and more preferably in an amount of about 85% to about<br>
90% by weight As used herein, the term "% by weight" is meant to indicate a percentage<br>
based on 100% total weight of the composition.<br>
The properties of the extruded foam or foam product may be modified by the<br>
selection of the molecular weight of the polymer. For example, the preparation of lower<br>
density extruded foam products is facilitated by using lower molecular weight polymers.<br>
On the other hand, the preparation of higher density extruded foam products is facilitated<br>
by the use of higher molecular weight or higher viscosity resins.<br>
The composition also includes at least one blowing agent Blowing agents useful<br>
in the practice of this invention include inorganic blowing agents, organic blowing agents,<br>
and chemical blowing agents. Any suitable blowing agent may be used in the practice on<br>
this invention. However, due to increased environmental concern over global warming<br>
and ozone depletion, it is desirable to utilize inorganic blowing agents. Examples of halo-<br>
carbon free inorganic blowing agents (for example, environmentally friendly, non-ozone<br>
depleting blowing agents) include carbon dioxide, argon, water, air, nitrogen, and helium.<br>
Organic blowing agents suitable for use in the present invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, Ci to C9 aliphatic hydrocarbons if or example, methane, ethane, propane, n-<br>
butane, isobutane, n-pentane, isopeniane, and neopentane), Ci to C3 aliphatic alcohols (for<br>
example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and isopropanol), and fully and partially<br>
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons having 1 to 4 carbon atoms (for example,<br>

trifluoroethane, pentafluoroethane, dichlorotettafluoroethane (CFC-114),<br>
chloroheptafluoropropane, and dichl orohexafluoropropane. Suitable chemical blowing<br>
agents include azodicarbonamide, azodiisobutyro-nitrile, benzenesulfonhydrazide, 4,4-<br>
oxybenzene sulfonyl-semicarbazide, p-toluene sulfonyl semi-carbazide, barium<br>
azodicarboxylate, and N.N'-dimethyl-N.N'-dinitrosoterephthalamide, and trihydrazino<br>
triazine.<br>
The blowing agent may be present in the composition in an amount from about<br>
2.0% to about 18.0% by weight. Preferably, the blowing agent is present in an amount<br>
from about 3.0% to about 10% by weight The blowing agent utilized in the inventive<br>
composition is preferably selected such that the composition has a zero ozone depletion<br>
and low global warming potential, such as, for example, any inorganic blowing agent<br>
and/or non-hydrogenated chlorofluorocarbons (non-HCFCs).<br>
As discussed above, the composition also contains one or more cell size enlarging<br>
agents. Desirably, the cell size enlarging agent dissolves or substantially dissolves in the<br>
foamable gel formed by the foamable polymer material and blowing agent discussed in<br>
detail below. Suitable examples of cell size enlarging agents for use in the inventive<br>
composition include ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA),<br>
polyethylene ethoxylate copolymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and combinations thereof.<br>
Structurally and chemically, these materials are based on polyethylene with added<br>
polarity. Preferably, the cell size enlarging agent is ethylene vinyl acetate and/or ethylene<br>
methyl acrylate. In addition, the cell size enlarging agent permits the formation of a foam<br>
with large cell sizes that are desirable n order to achieve a high insulation value (R-value)<br>
and to optimize the physical properties of the foamed product such as compressive<br>
strength and dimensional stability.<br>
The use of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and/or ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA) as<br>
a blowing agent in polymer foams iii contradictory to the current thought of those<br>
ordinarily skilled in the art, and as such, one of skill in the art would not readily choose to<br>
utilize either of these ethylene compounds as a cell size enlarging agent Conventionally,<br>
much of the testing with polystyrene resin foams has been conducted with a polyethylene<br>
additive. It was determined that these polyethylene additives separated from the polymer<br>
resin (for example, polystyrene) and bloomed to the surface. As a result, those of skill in<br>
the art generally went looking for ottter additives for use in conventional blowing agents<br>
used in polystyrene foams. However, it was surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered in<br>
the present invention that ethylene vinyl acetate and ethylene methyl acrylate mix well or<br>
at least sufficiently well at low concentrations in the foamable polymer material and causes<br>
an increase in the cell size of the produced foam. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that the ester groups present on the EVA and the EMA provide a source of<br>
energy, and that it is this source of increased energy that increases the cell size within the<br>
foam.<br>
In a similar manner of thinking, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is believed to provide<br>
better cell size enlarging properties to the foam and increased interaction with the blowing<br>
agent due to its increased energy source (that is; the hydroxyl end group of the glycol)<br>
compared to polyethylene oxide (PEO). The fundamental difference between polyethylene<br>
oxide and polyethylene glycol is the terminal hydroxyl group of the glycol in die<br>
polyethylene glycol. Again, not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that it is this<br>
energy difference that allows the polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase the cell size of the<br>
foam.<br>
One advantage of the cell siz«; enlarging, agent is that it provides an increased cell<br>
size to the foamed product without detracting from the physical and thermal properties of a<br>
conventional foamed product formed without a cell size enlarging agent. The cell size<br>
enlarging agent also provides a smoother surface and minimal or no surface defects to the<br>
extruded, foamed product, especially when compared to conventional foamed products. In<br>
addition, the improved smoothness of the surface area of the foamed product permits the<br>
inventive foam to be used in a wider variety of applications. The average cell size of the<br>
inventive foam and foamed product! t is about 50 microns to about SOO microns and<br>
preferably about 150 microns to about 250 microns. The cell size enlarging agent may be<br>
present in the inventive formulation in an amount from about 0.1% to about 10% by<br>
weight, and preferably in an amount from about 0.25% to about 2.0% by weight<br>
Additionally, the inventive composition may optionally contain a nucleating agent.<br>
Examples of nucleating agents useful in the invention include calcium silicate, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium stearate, clay, silica, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, diatomaceous<br>
earth, and indigo. Adding a nucleating agent to the inventive composition permits the<br>
addition of cheap filler materials into the foamed product. Therefore, it is desirable to add<br>
as much nucleating agent as possible to introduce a large amount of fillers into the foamed<br>
product. However, nucleating agents tend to decrease the cell size of the cells in the foam,<br>
which results in undesirable R-values of the final foamed products. As a result, a<br>
nucleating agent is not present in large amounts in the present composition (if it is present<br>
at all) and the decrease in cell size caused by the nucleating agent may be offset or<br>
regulated by the cell size enlarging agent It is to be appreciated that the addition of talc as<br>
a nucleating agent substantially reduces the cell size, and therefore is not a preferred<br>
nucleating agent for the present invention. The nucleating agent may be added to the<br>
composition in an amount up to about 1.0% by weight, preferably from about 0.1% to<br>
about 0.9% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.2% to about 0.4% by weight<br>
Further, the inventive composition may contain a fire retarding agent in an amount<br>
up to about 1.0% by weight. For example, fire retardant chemicals may be added in the<br>
extruded foam manufacturing process to impart fire retardant characteristics to the<br>
extruded foam products. Preferably, the fire retarding agent is added to the foamable gel,<br>
which is described below with respect to the formation of the inventive foam. Non-<br>
limiting examples of suitable fire retardant chemicals for use in the inventive composition<br>
include brominated aliphatic compounds such as hexabromocyclododecane and<br>
pentabromoeyclohexane, brominated phenyl ethers, esters of tetrabromophthalic acid, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Optional additives such as infrared attenuating agents, plasticizing agents,<br>
pigments, elastomers, extrusion aids, antioxidants, fillers, antistatic agents, and/or UV<br>
absorbers may be incorporated into the inventive composition. These optional additives<br>
may be included in amounts necessary to obtain desired characteristics of the foamable gel<br>
or resultant extruded foam product;!. Although it is preferred that the additives are added<br>
to the polymer mixture, they may be incorporated in the polymer mixture before, during, or<br>
after the polymerization process used to make the polymer.<br>
To form an alkenyl aromatic polymer foam having an enlarged cell size according<br>
to the principles of the instant invention, the foamable polymer material (for example, an<br>
alkenyl aromatic polymer material) and the cell size enlarging agent may be heated to a<br>
temperature at or above the polymer's glass transition temperature or melting point to form<br>
a plasticized or a melt polymer mattirial. One or more blowing agents may men be<br>
incorporated or mixed into the melt polymer material by any conventional method known<br>
to those of skill in the art such as, for example, with an extruder, a mixer, or a blender. As<br>
the blowing agent is added to the polymer melt, the blowing agent becomes soluble, that is<br>
dissolves, in the polymer melt and forms a foamable gel. Additionally, the blowing agent<br>
may be mixed with the melt polymer material at an elevated pressure sufficient to prevent<br>
substantial expansion of the melt polymer material and to generally disperse the blowing<br>
agent homogeneously in the melt polymer material. A nucleating agent may be blended in<br>
the polymer melt or dry blended with the polymer material prior to plasticizing or melting<br>
the foamable polymer material. In an alternate embodiment where polyethylene ethoxylate<br>
copolymer and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG) is utilized in a liquid form, it may be added<br>
directly to the extruder.<br>
The foamable gel may then be cooled to a die melt temperature. The die melt<br>
temperature is typically cooler than the melt mix temperature to optimize physical<br>
characteristics of the foamed product. In addition, it is desirable that the die pressure be<br>
sufficient to prevent, or at least minLnize, pre-ibaming of the foamable gel. Pre-foaming<br>
is the undesirable premature foaming of the foamable gel before extrusion of the gel into a<br>
region of reduced pressure. Thus, tbe die pressure varies depending upon die identity and<br>
amount of blowing agent present in the foamable gel. The foamable gel may then be<br>
extruded through a die having a desbed shape to a zone of lower or reduced pressure to<br>
form the desired foamed structure or foamed product. The zone of lower pressure is at a<br>
pressure lower than that in which the foamable gel is maintained prior to extrusion through<br>
the die. The lower pressure may be superatmospheric or subatmospheric (that is, a<br>
vacuum), but is preferably at atmospheric level.<br>
Extruded foams have a cellular structure with cells defined by cell membranes and<br>
struts. Struts are formed at the intersection of the cell membranes, with the cell<br>
membranes covering interconnecting cellular windows between the struts. In the present<br>
invention, the inventive composition preferably produces a substantially closed cellular<br>
foam with an average density of about 1.0 lbs/ft3 to about 5.0 lbs/ft3, preferably from about<br>
1.5 lbs/ft3 — 3.0 lbs/A3 and a cell size of from about 50 microns to about 500 microns<br>
which makes the foam especially uiieful for thermal insulation. It is to be appreciated that<br>
the phrase "substantially closed cell" is meant to indicate that the foam contains all closed<br>
cells or nearly all of the cells in the cellular structure are closed. It is desirable that not<br>
more than about 5.0% of the cells are open cells or otherwise "non-closed" cells. The<br>
closed cell structure helps to increase the R-value of a formed, foamed insulation product<br>
R-value is defined as the thermal resistance to heat flow across a sample material of a unit<br>
area and known thickness caused by a temperature difference across it (m* * K/W). The<br>
R-value per inch may be about 4.0 to about 8.0. In a most preferred embodiment, the R-<br>
value per inch is about 5.0. It is to be appreciated that it is within the purview of the<br>
present invention to produce an open cell structure, although such an open cell structure is<br>
not a preferred embodiment.<br>
Another aspect of the extruded inventive foams is that they possess a high level of<br>
dimensional stability. For example, the change in dimension in any direction is about 5%<br>
or less. In addition, the foam formed by the inventive composition is desirably<br>
monomodal and the cells have a relatively uniform average cell size. As used herein, the<br>
average cell size is an average of the cell sizes as determined in the X, Y and Z directions.<br>
In particular, the "X" direction is the direction of extrusion, the "Y" direction is the cross<br>
machine direction, and the "Z" direction is the thickness. In the present invention, the<br>
highest impact in cell enlargement is in the X and Y directions, which is desirable from an<br>
orientation and R-value perspective The extruded inventive foam can be used to make<br>
insulation products such as rigid insulation boards, insulation foam, and packaging<br>
products.<br>
There are numerous advantages of utilizing the composition of the present<br>
invention to form foam products. For example, die blowing agent utilized in the inventive<br>
formulation does not have a high global warming potential and has a low or zero ozone<br>
depleting potential. In addition, the cell size enlarging agents may be added to the melt<br>
polymer in a conventional fashion. Therefore, there is no need to modify existing<br>
equipment or change the manufacturing lines to accommodate the cell size enlarging<br>
agent. In addition, the cell size enlarging agent is environmentally friendly and does not<br>
create any negative environmental concerns. Further, the cell size enlarging agent<br>
increases the average cell size of the foamed product without detrimentally affecting the<br>
physical or thermal properties of the product.<br>
Having generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained<br>
by reference to certain specific examples illustrated below which are provided for purposes<br>
of illustration only and are not intended to be all inclusive or limiting unless otherwise<br>
specified.<br>
Examples<br>
Compositions containing polystyrene, a non-ozone depleting blowing agent, and<br>
the cell size enlarging agents depicted in FIG. ] were formed according to the method<br>
described in detail above. In particular, the polystyrene and cell size enlarging agent were<br>
heated to a temperature of 250 °C (that is, above the melt temperature of the polystyrene)<br>
to form a melt polymer material. The desired blowing agent was then mixed into the melt<br>
polymer to form a foamable gel. The foamable gel was cooled to 110°C - 130°C. The<br>
foamable gel was then extruded through a die to a zone of reduced pressure to produce the<br>
foam. A similar method was used to form the compositions set forth in FIGS. 5 and 6, but<br>
with a 1.0% by weight addition of the cell size enlarging agent.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, polyethylene ethoxylate copolymer, polyethylene<br>
glycol (PEG), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA)<br>
demonstrated the greatest increase in cell size compared to the control, which contained no<br>
cell size enlarging agent. It can be seen in FIG. 2 that the increase in cell size (that is, the<br>
impact of the cell size enlarging agent), is greater at the higher concentration of 1.0% by<br>
weight.<br>
FIGS. 3-6 depict the effect en die pressures using various cell size enlarging<br>
agents at different pressures and concentrations. As can be seen in FIGS. 3 and 5, the die<br>
pressure of the polyethylene ethoxylate copolymer is less man the control (no cell size<br>
enlarging agent) at both 0.5% by weight addition at 0 mm Hg and at 1.0% by weight<br>
addition at 0 mm Hg. This decrease iti pressure., if taken into consideration in isolation<br>
and not in conjunction with oilier factors such as the amount of cell size enlargement<br>
caused by the cell size enlarging agent and/or the cost of the cell size enlarging agent,<br>
would indicate that polyethylene ettoxylate would be the candidate of choice as a<br>
desirable cell size enlarger. However, although it is advantageous to have a low die<br>
pressure in the extruder (but not such that it causes a pre-foaming of the foamable gel),<br>
from a practical point of view, the specific cell size enlarging agent will not always permit<br>
a low die pressure. This fact can bo seen, for example, with EVA, which demonstrated an<br>
increase in cell size enlargement at both 0.5% by weight and 1.0% by weight addition, but<br>
demonstrated an increased die pressure. EMA, as shown in FIG. 1, demonstrated the<br>
greatest increase in cell size at 0.5% by weight addition at both 0 and 12 mm Hg,<br>
However, it demonstrated an increase in die pressure at 0.5% by weight increase at 0 mm<br>
Hg. Thus, FIGS. 3 - 6 are included to show that multiple factors were taken into<br>
consideration in determining the cell size enlarging agent for use m the composition to<br>
form a foamed product.<br>
Example 2 — Effect of Cell Size Enlarging Agents on Average Cell Size<br>
In this Example, a glycerol taonostearate/ethylene vinyl acetate mixture<br>
(GMS/EVA), a glycerol monostearate and polystyrene mixture, and ethylene vinyl acetate<br>
(EVA) were utilized as cell size enlarging agents in a foamable composition according to<br>
the present invention. The foamablts composition containing the desired cell size enlarging<br>
agent were run at two different concentrations, namely, 0.5% and 1.0% by weight cell size<br>
enlarging agent. In addition, the foamable compositions were run under two atmospheric<br>
conditions, specifically, at no vacuum and at 12 mm Hg. The results of the testing are<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7 and in Tables 1 - 4. As shown in FIG. 7, the results indicated a slight<br>
increase in cell size at a 0.5% by weight addition of the glycerol monostearate/ethylene<br>
vinyl acetate mixture (GMS/EVA) aad a moderate increase in cell size with the glycerol<br>
monostearate and polystyrene mixture (for example, approximately 7 - 8% increase in cell<br>
size). However, the increase in the cell size at 0.5% by weight EVA was substantially<br>
larger than the other tested materials at that same concentration.<br>
Of the various cell size enlargers shown in FIG. 7, the increase cell size generally<br>
was larger and more prominent with EVA which demonstrated an approximate 36%<br>
increase in cell size at 0.5% by weight addition (no vacuum), a 35% increase at 0.5% by<br>
weight addition (no vacuum), a 59% increase at 1.0% by weight addition (12 mm Hg), and<br>
a 61% increase at 1.0% by weight addition (12 mm Hg). The mixture of GMS and EVA<br>
demonstrated a slight increase in c«:ll size at the higher concentration of 1.0% and<br>
demonstrated a cell size increase of approximately 14%. There was a no increase in the<br>
cell size with the polystyrene/GMS mixture. In fact, there was a decrease in cell size,<br>
indicating that the polystyrene/GMS mixture was not an effective cell size enlarger at a<br>
higher concentration. Thus, it was ;oncluded from FIG. 7 that of the cell size enlargers<br>
tested, the mixture of GMS and EV A. was a moderately effective cell size enlarger and<br>
EVA was the most effective cell size enlarger.<br>
It can be seen from Tables 1 - - 4 that when the components of the cell size were<br>
evaluated in the X, Y, and Z directions, the highest impact from the cell size enlarging<br>
agents is on the increase in the X and Y directions. Such an increase in the X and Y<br>
directions is desirable from an orientation perspective and thus, an R-value perspective<br>
{for example, decreasing diffusion and increasing cell wall density). It can also be seen<br>
from Tables 1-4 that the cell size enlargers impact the cell morphology.<br>
