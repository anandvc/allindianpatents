				<td>The present invention relates to a washing machine.<br>
The present invention relates to a washing machine.  Particularly, it relates to a connecting structure in a water supply portion to the washing machine.<br>
A general fully automatic washing machine, for example, comprises a water supply valve in its upper part and a water pouring port formed in a box shape connected to the water supply valve in order to supply water to a laundry sink.  Generally, the water supply valve and the water pouring port are connected to each other through a flexible hose.  The hose and a portion where the water supply valve and the water pouring port are connected to each other are fixed to each other with adhesives and by a fastening band in order to prevent water from leaking and prevent the hose from dropping down.  Such fixing work is troublesome and is low in assembly workability, so that the<br><br>
assembly cost is high.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned technical subject, and to provide a washing machine comprising in its water supply portion a connecting structure making connection between a hose and a water pouring port easy and capable of reliably preventing water from leaking in a simple structure.<br>
In order to attain the object, in a washing machine having a water supply portion including a water pouring port forming member for pouring water into a laundry sink and a water supply valve for controlling the circulation of the water into the water pouring port forming member, a washing machine is characterized by comprising a connecting structure for connecting the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member to each other and communicating a hole of the water supply valve and a hole of the water pouring port forming member with each other, the connecting structure having a recess formed in the water<br><br>
pouring port forming member, a projection formed in the water supply valve so as to enter the recess, and an annular packing arranged in the recess for sealing the hole, a sealing surface of the projection and a sealing surface of the recess being arranged opposite to each other with the packing interposed between the projection and the recess in the recess, and a position regulating surface of the projection and a position regulating surface of the recess being abutted against each other to be opposed to each other such that the relative position therebetween can be regulated.<br>
According to this construction, the projection of the water supply valve is inserted into the recess of the water pouring port forming member, to directly connect the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member to each other, thereby making it possible to communicate their respective holes with each other.<br>
The projection is thus inserted into the recess, thereby making it possible to complete both the sealing by the packing and the regulation of the relative position by opposing<br><br>
both the position regulating surfaces. Therefore, the water supply valve and the water pour: ing port forming member can be easily connected to each other.<br>
The relative position between the projection and the recess is regulated by the position regulating surfaces, so that the packing is prevent ed. from being deformed.  As a result, even if water pressure is applied at the time of supplying water, there is no possibility that the water leaks.<br>
Both the position regulating surfaces and the packing are provided in the recess, so that the structure can be simplified.  Moreover, the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member can be mounted outside the recess at a high degree of freedom.<br>
Furthermore, the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member can be directly connected to each other by the connecting structure, so that components which have been conventionally required, for example, a connecting hose can be omitted, and the connection therebetween is easier, as compared with connection by a hose or the like.<br><br>
Consequently, the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member can be easily connected to each other in a simple structure by omitting alignment work which has been conventionally required andcomponents, structures and so forth for the work.  Further, the water supply valve and the water pouring port forming member can be directly connected to each other, so that components such as a connecting hose can be omitted, and the connection therebetween is easy.<br>
The washing machine is further<br>
characterized in that the sealing surface and the position regulating surface are concentric peripheral surfaces.<br>
According to this construction, the sealing surface and the position regulating surface which are composed of concentric peripheral surfaces can be constructed with high precision and at low cost.<br>
The washing machine is further<br>
characterized in that the position regulating surface is provided near an inlet of the recess against the sealing surface.<br>
According to this construction, after the<br><br>
packing is fitted, the respective centers of the position regulating surfaces can be autonomically aligned with each other utilizing the elasticity of the packing, so that the position regulating surfaces can be easily opposed to each other.<br>
The washing machine is further<br>
characterized in that the position regulating surface of the projection and the position regulating surface of the recess are fitted to each other with no clearance.<br>
According to this construction, the relative position between the position regulating surfaces can be reliably regulated.<br>
The washing machine is further<br>
characterized in that the recess is formed in the water supply valve in place of the water pouring port forming member, and the projection is formed in the water pouring port forming member in place of the water supply valve.<br>
According to this construction, even when the recess and the projection are replaced with each other to construct the connecting structure, the same function of the above invention can be obtained.<br><br>
A fitting structure of the present invention is a fitting structure in which a projection formed in a first member enters a recess formed in a second member, so that the first member and the second member are connected to each other, to communicate a hole formed in the first member and a hole formed in the second member with each other, characterized in that a sealing surface of the first member and a sealing surface of the second member are arranged opposite to each other in the recess, an annular packing for sealing a hole is interposed between the sealing surface of the first member and the sealing surface of the second member, and a position regulating surface of the first member and a position regulating surface of the second member are abutted against each other to be opposed to each other such that the relative position between the first and second members can be regulated.<br>
According to this construction, the relative position between the first member and the second member is regulated by the position regulating surfaces, so that the packing is<br><br>
prevented from being deformed, thereby eliminating the possibility that the water leaks .<br>
Both the sealing by the packing and the regulation of the relative position by the position regulating surfaces can be completed by inserting the projection into the recess. Therefore, the first member and the second member can be easily connected to each other.<br>
Both the position regulating surfaces and the packing are provided in the recess, so that the structure can be simplified.  Moreover, it is possible to increase the degree of freedom in mounting both the first and second members outside the recess.  For example, it is possible to omit alignment work, which has been conventionally required, other than the work for inserting the projection into the recess, and components, structures, and so forth for the work.  Therefore, the members can be easily connected to each other in a simple structure.<br><br>
According to  the  present invention  there  is provided  a washing machine<br>
having<br>
a water supply portion comprising<br>
a water pouring port forming member for pouring water into a laundry sink,<br>
and<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
One embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side sectional view of the schematic construction of a washing machine according to one embodiment of the present invention.  A washing machine 1 has a laundry sink 3 supported through a suspension bar 4 in a housing 2 in a box shape.  Water and laundry are contained in the laundry sink 3, and an agitating blade 5 provided at the bottom of the laundry sink 3 is rotated, to perform washing.<br>
An inlet 2b of the laundry into the laundry sink 3 is provided at the center on an upper surface 2a of the housing 2, and a water supply<br><br>
mechanism 6 for pouring water into the laundry sink 3 is provided behind the inlet 2b.  The water supply mechanism 6 comprises a water pouring port forming member 7 for defining a water pouring port provided at a rear edge of the inlet 2b, and a water supply valve 8 composed of, for example, an electromagnetic valve for controlling the circulation of water into the water pouring port forming member 7. The water supply valve 8 is connected to water supply installation such as an external water faucet (not shown) through a hose 9.<br>
Fig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the water supply mechanism of the washing machine shown in Fig. 1.  Fig. 3 is a plan view, partly in section of the part shown in Fig. 2.<br>
In the washing machine 1, the water pouring port forming member 7 and the water supply valve 8 are connected to each other by a fit. ting structure C serving as a connecting structure.  That is, a recess 73 is defined in an elbow 72 provided at the back of the water pouring port forming member 7.  A projection 87 of an outlet cylinder 85 in the water supply<br><br>
valve 8 enters the recess 73, to interpose a packing 10 between the elbow 72 and the outlet cylinder 85.  The details of the fitting structure C will be described below.<br>
The water supply valve 8 has a valve body 81 curved in an L shape and a solenoid 82 provided with a curved part of the valve body 81.  The valve body 81 has a center 84 including a valve seat and a valve body driven by the solenoid 82, an inlet cylinder 83 and the outlet cylinder 85 which extend in directions perpendicular to each other from the center 84, and a flange 86 for fixing.  The flange 86 and a rear surface 2c of the housing 2 are fixed to each other by screws.  A communicating hole 80 penetrates the inlet cylinder 83, the center 84, and the outlet cylinder 85.<br>
The outlet cylinder 85 has the projection 87 entering the recess 73 in the elbow 72.  The projection 87 has a taper 91 provided at its end for preventing the packing 10 from slipping off, a sealing surface 92 composed of its outer peripheral surface which is closely fitted in an inner peripheral surface of the packing 10,<br><br>
and a position regulating surface 93 adjacent to a position closer to its root than the outer peripheral surface,<br>
The position regulating surface 93 is an outer peripheral surface having a larger diameter than that of the sealing surface 92, and is formed concentrically with the sealing surface 92.  A step is formed between the position regulating surface 93 and the sealing surface 92.  The position regulating surface 93 is fitted in a position regulating surface 74 of the water pouring port forming member 7.<br>
The water pouring port forming member 7 has the curved elbow 72 in a cylindrical shape on the rear surface of a main body 71 having a water pouring port on its front surface.  The elbow 72 defines the recess 73 in its inner part.  A communicating hole is formed from the recess 73 to the main body 71.  The recess 73 is provided with a sealing surface 75 composed of its inner peripheral surface which is positioned nearer its innermost part and is closely fitted in an outer peripheral surface of the packing 10 and the position regulating surface 74 positioned nearer its inlet.<br><br>
The position regulating surface 74 is an inner peripheral surface having a larger diameter than that of the sealing surface 75 and is formed concentrically with the sealing surface 75, and a step is formed between the position regulating surface 74 and the sealing surface 75.  The position regulating surface 74 is fitted in the position regulating surface 93 of the outlet cylinder 85.  This fitting is in a light press-fit state, and is so set that the position regulating surface 74 and the position regulating surface 93 can be easily mounted on each other upon being abutted against with each other with no clearance.  The position regulating surface 74 and the position regulating surface 93 are abutted against each other, to regulate the relative position between the outlet cylinder 85 and the elbow 72 within a previously determined predetermined range in the radial direction.  The previously determined predetermined range is so set that the packing 10 can maintain a waterproofing performance even if the relative position is changed in the range so that the packing 10 is deformed.  If the relative position between the<br><br>
outlet cylinder 85 and the elbow 72 can be regulated in this range, a clearance may be provided between the position regulating surface 74 and the position regulating surface 9 3 .<br>
The packing 10 is composed of an elastic member such as rubber, for example, and is formed in the shape of a cylinder extending in the axial direction.  A plurality of lips 11 are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the packing 10.  The lip 11 is composed of a projection formed in an annular shape on the outer peripheral surface of the packing 10. When the packing 10 is mounted on the sealing surface 92 of the projection 87, and is fitted in the sealing surface 75 of the elbow 72, the lips 11 are compressed and are reliably water sealed.<br>
In the fitting structure C, the projection 87 formed in the outlet cylinder 85 serving as a first member is thus inserted into the recess 73 formed in the elbow 72 serving as a second member, so that the first member and the second member are connected to each other, to communicate a communicating hole formed in the<br><br>
first member and a communicating hole formed in the second member with each other.  The sealing surface 92 of the first member and the sealing surface 75 of the second member are arranged opposite to each other in the recess 73, and the annular packing 10 for sealing the communicating hole is interposed between the sealing surface 75 and the sealing surface 92. Further, the position regulating surface 93 of the first member and the position regulating surface 74 of the second member are abutted against each other in the recess 73 to be opposed to each other such that the relative position between the first and second members can be regulated.<br>
The relative position, for example, the central position between the outlet cylinder 85 and the elbow 72 can be prevented from being excessively shifted in the radial direction by providing the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93, and can be reliably sealed by maintaining an adhesive state over the whole peripheral surface between the packing 10 and the sealing surfaces 75 and 92.<br>
Description is now made of a process for<br><br>
connection between the water pouring port forming member 7 and the water supply valve 8. The packing 10 is previously fitted in the sea 1 ing surface 92 of the water supply valve 8.<br>
The projection 87 of the outlet cylinder 85 is then inserted into the recess 73 of the elbow 72.  That is, the outer peripheral surface of the packing 10 is fitted in the sealing surface 75 of the recess 73, and is pressed thereinto until their respective steps are abutted against each other.  At this time, the respective centers of the outlet cylinder 85 and the elbow 72 are autonomically aligned with each other by the elasticity of the packing 10, so that the position regulating surface 74 and the position regulating surface 93 can be easily fitted to each other. Consequently, the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 are connected to each other, so that their respective communicating holes are communicated with each other.<br>
An assembly of the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 is mounted on the housing 2.  The flange 86 of the<br><br>
water supply valve 8 and the rear surface 2 c of the housing 2 are fixed to each other by screws 12.  At this time, the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 need not be aligned with each other with high precision, and are easily assembled.<br>
In the washing machine 1 according to the embodiment of the present invention, the fitting structure C is provided in the water supply mechanism 6 , so that the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 can be directly connected to each other easily only by inserting the projection 87 into the recess 73.<br>
The water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 can be directly connected to each other by the fitting structure C , so that it is possible to omit components which have been conventionally required, for example, a connecting hose and a fastener for preventing the hose from slipping off.  Further, the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 can be connected to each other more easily, as compared with the connection through the hose,<br><br>
because they are directly connected to each other by the fitting structure C.  As a result, it. is possible to reduce the costs of the components of the washing machine 1 and the assembly cost.<br>
The relative position between the<br>
projection 87 and the recess 73 is regulated by the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93, so that the packing 10 is prevented from being deformed, thereby eliminating the possibility that, water leaks.  Although it is presumed that, water pressure and vibration are exerted at the time of operating the water supply valve 8, there is no possibility that water leaks even if the water pressure and the vibration are exerted .<br>
Both the sealing by the packing 10 and the regulation of the relative position by the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93 can be completed by inserting the projection 87 into the recess 73.  Therefore, the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 can be easily connected to each other.<br>
Since both the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93 and the packing 10 are provided in<br><br>
the recess 73, the structure can be simplified. Moreover, the degree of freedom in mounting the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 outside the recess 73 can be increased.  For example, it is possible to omit work, for aligning the projection 87 and the recess 73 with high precision which has been conventionally required in addition to work for inserting the projection 87 into the recess 73, and components, structures and so forth for the work.  Therefore, the water supply valve 8 and the water pouring port forming member 7 can be easily connected to each other in a simple structure.  Further, the packing 10 can be reliably prevented from being deformed near the packing 10.  As a result, it is possible to prevent the water from leaking more reliably. Since the position regulating surface 74 and the sealing surface 75 are composed of concentric peripheral surfaces, they can be constructed with high precision and at low cost.  As a result, this is preferable to reliably preventing the water from leaking. Similarly, the position regulating surface 93 and the sealing surface 92 are concentric<br><br>
peripheral surfaces, which is preferable.<br>
Since the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93 are provided near the inlet of the recess 73 against the sealing surfaces 75 and 92 for holding the packing 10, their respective cent, ers can be autonomically aligned with each other utilizing the elasticity of the fitted packing 10.  As a result, the position regulating surfaces 74 and 93 can be connected to each other more easily.<br>
The position regulating surfaces 74 and 93 which are fitted to each other with no clearance can reliably regulate the relative position therebetween, thereby making it possible to reliably prevent the water from leaking.<br>
Furthermore, the water supply valve 8 can be supported by the housing 2 using the fitting structure C, so that the water pressure and the vibration can be reliably received by the housing 2 in a simple structure.<br>
The packing 10 is not limited to the above-mentioned one.  For example, the packing 10 may be one with no lip 11, and one in an annular shape.  The packing 10 may be mounted on the<br><br>
recess 73.  In short, the packing 10 may be one for sealing a position between an inner peripheral surface and an outer peripheral surface of each of the outlet cylinder 85 serving as the first member and the elbow 72 serving as the second member upon being interposed therebetween.<br>
Although in the above-mentioned embodiment the projection 87 is formed in the water supply valve 8, and the recess 73 is formed in the water pouring port forming member 7, the present invention is not limited to the same. For example, even if the recess is formed in the water supply valve 8 and the projection is formed in the water pouring port forming member 7 , t. he fitting structure C can be similarly constructed, to obtain the effect thereof.<br>
Although in the above-mentioned embodiment the fitting structure C is applied to the water supply mechanism 6 in a single-sink type washing machine, the present invention is not limited to the same.  For example, it is applicable to a connecting portion relating to a drainage pipe of a fixed type laundry sink. Further, the fitting structure C is applicable<br><br>
to an equipment having a pipe for water passage, for example, a dish washing machine in addition to the washing machine.<br>
In addition thereto, various design changes can be made in a range in which the gist of the present invention is not changed.<br><br><br><br><br>
