The invention relates to a hinge-lid box hinge-lid pack) , in particular for cigarettes, comprising a single-piece blank made of thin cardboard for forming a box part with a box front wall, box rear wall, box side walls and base wall and for forming a lid with a lid front wall, lid rear wall, lid side walls and end wall, and also having a collar comprising a collar front wall and collar side tabs, the collar being connected, in the region of the collar front wall, to the box front wall via residual connections or webs which, when the blank is folded, can be folded in a Z-shaped manner such that the residual connections or webs butt against the inside of the box front wall.<br>
Various designs are known for hinge-lid boxes comprising blanks in which the collar is connected integrally to a main blank for the box part and lid. In the case of the hinge-lid box according to EP 6 872, webs are arranged, as means for connection to the collar, on the upright sides of the box front wall. By virtue of its position relative to the box front wall being changed, said collar is folded into the pack-specific position, in which case the webs are moved into a Z-shaped folded position.<br>
The hinge-lid box according to DE 27 59 178 is of similar configuration, the foldable connection between the box front wall and collar front wall extending over the entire width of the box front wall.<br>
The object of the invention is to develop further, and improve, hinge-lid boxes of the abovedescribed (design such that production is made easier and the outer appearance of the finished hinge-lid box is improved.<br><br>
In order to achieve this object, the hinge-lid box according to the invention is characterized in that the collar front wall, which butts against the (Z-shaped) folded webs on the inside, has a cutout or depression in the region of the webs, the relevant web passing at least partially into said cutout or depression.<br>
The hinge-lid box according to the invention is based on the finding that the residual connections or webs in the folded position, that is to say in the position between the collar front wall and box front wall, create an additional material layer and thus a thickened formation. This is wholly or partially eliminated according to the invention by virtue of the cutout or depression in the collar front wall, in the region of the folded web, with the result that the latter is at least predominantly located in the cutout and a local thickened formation in the material is thus avoided.<br>
According  to  the  invention,  the  positioning  and<br>
i dimensions  of  the  cutout  are  adapted  to  the<br>
dimensioning and positioning of the web when folded. By<br>
virtue of a: specific configuration of the webs, namely<br>
by virtue oi a transversely directed partial cut in the<br>
region of a folding articulation, the folded web can<br>
assume a clamping position in the cutout of the collar<br>
front wall and can thus fix the folded position of the<br>
collar or of the webs.<br>
' '■	.    '<br>
A further Special feature of the invention consists in<br>
proposing  a design for  a  single-piece  blank  for  a ■'special^ type  of  hinge-lid boxes,  namely  those with rounded  longitudinal  edges  or  bevelled  longitudinal edges (of octagonal cross-section).<br>
Further details regarding the configuration of single-piece hinge-lid boxes within the context of the invention are explained in more detail hereinbelow with<br><br>
reference to exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 11 shows,  on  a  vastly  enlarged  scale,   a<br>
horizontal section of a detail of a hinge-lid box according to Figure 7 in the collar/box-part region, and<br>
Figure 12 shows an illustration analogous to Figure 11<br>
for the hinge-lid box according to Figure 8.<br>
A typical hinge-lid box comprises a (relatively large) box part 10, a lid 11 and a collar 12. The box part 10 forms a box front wall 13, a box rear wall 14 and narrow, elongate box side walls 15 and 16. The box part 10 is bounded at the bottom by a base 17. Analogously to this,  ,the lid 11 comprises lid front wall 18, lid rear wall 19, lid side walls 20, 21 and a top end wall 22. The lid 11 is connected pivot ably to the box part 10, to be precise  an articulation line 23 between the box rear wall 14 and lid rear wall 19.<br>
It is also typical of a hinge-lid box that the box side walls 15, 16 and the lid side walls 20, 21 are of double-layered design that is to say each comprise an inner box side tab 24 and outer box side tab 25. Analogously, the lid side walls 2 0 and 21 are of double-layered design at is to say comprise an inner lid side tab 26 and an outer lid side tab 27. The side tabs 24, 25 of the box part 10, on the one hand, and the side tabs 26, 27 of the lid 11, on the other hand, are separated off from one another by oblique closing edges 28, 29.<br>
A further important constituent part of the hinge-lid box is the collar 12, with a collar front wall 30 and transversely directed collar side tabs 31 and 32. The collar 12 is seated, by way of a bottom region, in the box part 10 and is anchored in the latter. A collar top<br><br>
part, which projects out of the box part 10, is enclosed by the lid 11 when the hinge-lid box is in the closed position. The collar front wall 30 butts against the inside of the box front wall 13, while the collar side tabs 31, 32 butt against the box side walls 15, 16 on the inside.<br>
The hinge-lid box as a whole, that is to say including the collar 12, comprises a single-piece blank (made of thin cardboard)- The box part 10 and lid 11 form a main blank 33. The collar 12 is connected to said main blank 33 in the region of the box front wall 13, to be precise via residual connections, namely webs 34 and 35. The rectangular or strip-like webs 34 and 35 are positioned in the lateral region of the box front wall 13, on the one hand, and of the collar front wall 30, on the other hand. Each web 34, 35 is bounded in the longitudinal direction by punch cuts 36, 37. Folding lines 38, 39 extend transversely thereto. The folding line 39 which is at. the bottom, or faces the box front wall 13, is located in the top boundary of the box front wall, 13, that; is to say in extension of a free transverse edge 40 of the Ipox  front wall 13,<br>
When the hinge-lid box has been folded, or the collar 12 is in the pack-specific position, the latter, in relation to the spread-out position of Figure 3, has been displaced relative to the main blank 33, to be precise in the direction of the base 17. In this process, the webs 34, 35 are folded into a Z-shaped position (Figure 2), In this case, the webs 34, 35 butt against the rearside of the box front wall 13. The folding line 39, which is at the top following the folding operation, is flush with the transverse edge 40. The folding line 38 is located at a distance therebeneath. The webs 34, 35 are dimensioned such that, in this folded position (Figure 2) , the entire collar 12 has been moved, relative to the main blank 33, into the position appropriate for the pack.<br><br>
In order at least partially to avoid a three-layered arrangement in the region of the folded webs 34, 35, the collar front wall 30 is provided, in the region of the webs 34, 35, with a cutout 41, 42 which is produced by punching. The cutouts 41, 42 are positioned, configured and dimensioned such that a (top) part of the folded webs 34, 35 passes into the associated cutout 41, 4 2 (Figure 2). This gives in said top region of the webs 34, 35, a two-layered design as is the case elsewhere where the collar front wall 30 butts against the box front wall 13.<br>
In the case of the present exemplary embodiments, the cutouts 41, 42 are of rectangular f^esigH, preferably of slightly greater width than that of the webs 34, 35.<br>
Further details of the configuration of the blank according to Figure 3 are alsor designed in accordance with the special features of the present hinge-lid box. For example, the overall width 43 of the blank is greater (e.g. 98 mm) than the collar width 44 (95 mm). The wall width 4 5 is, for example, 55 mm. The width of the webs 34, 35 may be 6 mm and that of the associated cutouts 41, 42 6.5 mm. The web length 46 (from folding line 38 to folding line 39) is 7.5 mm in Figures 1 to 3. A distance 47 between the folding line 38 (which was originally at the top) and a remote border of the cutout 41,' 4 2 is provided as being 7 mm. The distance between the folding line 38 and the facing border of the cutout 41, 42 is approximately 3 mm here.<br>
......^<br>
A further special feature in terms of the configuration of the blank is that there is a clear distance of at least 2 mm between an oblique edge 48 of the outer box side tab 25 and a corresponding oblique edge 4 9, as bottom boundary of the collar side tab 31, 32. This produces a free interspace 50, which extends as far as an outer border of the respectively associated web 34,<br><br>
35. This renders more precise folding possible. In particular, the situation where the collar side tabs 31, 32 catch on the box side tabs 25 during folding of the webs 34, 35 and of the collar 12 is avoided.<br>
In the folded position (Figures 1, 2), the collar 12 is connected to the box part 10. In the case of the present exemplary embodiment, the region of the collar front wall 30 is provided with spots of glue, to be precise two spots of glue 51, 52, approximately level with the cutouts 41, 42. The collar front wall 30 is anchored on the inside of the box front wall 13 with the aid of these spots of glue 51, 52. In the case of this exemplary embodiment, the webs 34, 35 are expediently also anchored in the folded position (in particular Figure 2) by adhesive bonding. The webs 34, 35 may be  fixed by adhesive bonding to the facing, inner side of the box front wall 13.<br>
^iaj-™,^.,^<br>
A further special feature is realized in the case of the hinge-lid box according to Figures 4, 5 and 6. In this version, the webs 34, 3 5 are wider than in the case of the exemplary embodiment of Figures 1 to 3. Correspondingly, the cutouts 41, 42 are also dimensioned to be  of a greater width, that is to say they are 'slightly wider than the webs 34, 35. In the longitudinal direction of the blank, the cutouts 41, 42 are of smaller dimensions, namely are considerably shorter than the webs 34, 35.<br>
The webs 34, 35 are separated off from the main blank 33 or from the box front wall 13 by folding lines 39, which are an extension of the transverse edge 40. The opposite folding line, which faces the cutout 41, 42, is modified. A preferably centrally arranged severing cut 53, 54 in the region of the (imaginary) folding line bounds a top end edge 55 of the web 34, 35. The end edge 55 extends between narrow, lateral residual webs 56, 57. A folding line which corresponds to the<br><br>
folding line 38 runs in the region of said residual webs 56, 57.<br>
When the collar 12 is in the folded position, at least a top region of the web 34, 35 passes through the associated cutout 41, 42. In the region of the severing cut 53, 54, the resulting end edge 55 or a facing region of the web 34, 35 butts against the rear side or inside of the collar front wall 30 (Figure 5) . This produces a clamping effect. The web 34, 35 is anchored on the collar by the clamping positioning of the top region. Additional adhesive bonding of the web 34, 35 in the folded position (to the box front wall 13) may be provided, but is dispensed with in the case of the exemplary embodiment according to Figures 4 to 6.<br>
In other respects, the hinge-lid box and blank of this exemplary embodiment correspond to that of Figures 1 to 3.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show specially  designed hinge-lid boxes, namely ones with rounded longitudinal edges, that is to say round edges 58, 59 (Figure 7), or with bevelled edges, that is to say oblique edges 60, 61 (Figure 8). These types of pack are known in principle. The special feature is in the use of single-piece blanks for these types of pack and in the further special features which result therefrom. Figures 7 and 8 each show a cigarette block 62 (in chain-dot ted lines) as an example of pack contents. Said cigarette block comprises a cigarette group which is enclosed by an inner wrapper, namely a tin-foil or paper blank.<br>
Both hinge-lid boxes (Figures 7, 8) comprise single-piece blanks. The collar 12 is connected to the main blank 33 via webs 34, 35 in each case. In the case of the exemplary embodiments shown, the cutouts 41, 42 are also provided, although it is likewise possible for them to be dispensed with. Furthermore, the blanks may<br><br>
'^•^.<br>
be designed in accordance ,with the details described in conjunction with Figures 4 to 6,<br>
An advantageous embodiment of a blank for a hinge-lid box according to Figure 7 is shown in Figure 9. The round edges 58, 59 are defined by folding strips 63, 64 which separate off a central region of the main blank 33 from lateral folding tabs, that is to say box front wall 13, box rear wall 14, base 17, lid front wall 18, lid rear wall 19 and end wall 22, on the one hand, from the box side tabs 24, 25 and lid side tabs 26, 27, on the other hand. In terms of width, the folding strip 63, 64 corresponds to the dimensioning of the round edges 58, 59. The folding strip 63, 64 comprises grooves 65 which run parallel, and at a small distance from one another, in the longitudinal direction of the blank. The grooves 65 are provided by appropriate stamping tools in the packaging machine or outside the latter-<br>
Since the collar 12 has round edges 58, 59 as well, folding strips 66, 67 are also provided in the region of the , collar 12, to be precise preferably simultaneously with the folding strips 63, 64 in the region of the main blank 33. The special feature is that the folding strips 63, 64, on the one hand, and 66, 67, on the other hand, run flush on the mutually facing sides. Towards the outside, that is to say towards the collar side tabs 31, 32, the folding strips 66, 67 of the collar 12 are of a smaller width 68 than the width 69 of the folding strips 63, 64. The dimensioning expediently differs by one groove 65.<br>
In the case of this type of hinge-lid box, the webs 34, 35 are positioned such that the outer punch cuts 37 are at a (small), distance from the facing grooves 65 or folding strips 63, 64 or 66, 67, This distance may be 1.5  to 2 mm,  and ensures  that  the grooves ' of  the<br><br>
folding strips 63, etc. do not run in the region of the webs 34,35.<br>
Furthermore, the blank according to Figure 9 is designed, such that rounded corners allow the base 17<br>
and	end wall 22 to match with the shape of the round<br>
edges 58, 59. It is only in the region outside the round edges 58, 5 9 that the box side tabs 2 4 and 2 5 and the lid side tabs 26 and 27 butt against one another or overlap one another. Said side tabs are connected to one another by adhesive bonding in said region.<br>
Analogously, the blank according to Figure 10 is designed for a hinge-lid box with oblique edges 60, 61. order to produce these oblique edges 60, 61, two parallel folding lines 70, 71 are formed in the region of the blank. Said folding lines extend over the entire region of the main blank 33, including the lid. The collar 12 is likewise coordinated with the (octagonal) cross-sectional configuration of the pack'. Two parallel folding lines are provided for the purpose of separating off the collar front wall 30 from the collar side tabs 31, 32. These folding lines, however, are parallel perforation lines 72, 73. The respectively outer perforation lines 72 are interrupted in a top or outer region by a C-shaped punching 7 4. The latter forms in each case a protrusion or overhang of the collar on, the front side of the pack so that the lid 11 can be fixed in the closed position. The perforation lines 72, 73, as predefined folding lines in the region of the collar 12, are arranged such that the inner perforation lines 73 are spaced apart from one another by a smaller distance than the inner, mutually facing folding lines 70. For example, the distance between the folding lines 70 may be 51.3 mm and the distance between the perforation lines 73 may be 50.3 mm. This then gives the position for the outer perforation lines 72. The distance between the latter and the respectively adjacent inner perforation line 73 may be<br><br>
7. 9 mm and the distance between the two mutually associated folding lines 70, 71 8.9 mm. Consequently, the outer folding lines 71 are offset outwards with respect to the outer perforation lines 72,<br>
These geometrical interrelationships mean that adjacent walls run as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Figure 11 shows a detail of the pack according to Figure 7 in the region where the collar 12 and box front wall 13 overlap. The quarter-circle regions of the box front wall 13 and collar 12 are located concentrically with respect to one another, that is to say with the same (imaginary) centre point. This effect is ensured by the above described dimensions. Accordingly, in the region of the collar 12, the round edge 58, 59 is of a smaller diameter than that of the box front wall 13.<br>
The hinge-lid box according to Figure 8 is of analogous design in this region. (Upright) edges of the box front wall 13 formed by the folding lines 70, 71 are on a line with the edges formed by the perforation lines 72<br>
and 73-<br>
In other respects,  the hinge-lid boxes according to<br>
Figures 7  to 12 may be designed in a Known manner and/or  with all the details 'of the hinge-lid boxes according to Figures 1 to 6, namely in terms of the connection of the collar 12 to the main blank 33.<br><br><br><br>
