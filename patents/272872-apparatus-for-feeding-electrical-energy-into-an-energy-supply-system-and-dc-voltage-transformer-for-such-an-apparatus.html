				<td>APPARATUS FOR FEEDING ELECTRICAL ENERGY<br>
INTO A POWER GRID AND DC VOLTAGE<br>
CONVERTER FOR SUCH AN APPARATUS<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus of the type recited in the preamble of<br>
claim 1 and to a DC voltage converter suited therefor.<br>
To feed electrical energy generated with DC voltage generators such as<br>
photovoltaic or fuel cell plants into an AC grid, in particular into the utility<br>
grid (50/60 Hz), various inverters are used. Between the DC voltage<br>
generator and the inverter there is mostly provided a DC voltage converter<br>
(DC-DC chopper) that serves the purpose of converting the DC voltage<br>
supplied by the DC voltage generator into a DC voltage needed by the<br>
inverter or adapted thereto.<br>
For different reasons, it is desired to ground one of the outputs of the DC<br>
voltage generator. The reason for the desired grounding is on the one side<br>
that there are countries which prescribe such grounding. On the other side,<br>
different disadvantages arise in operation when grounding is missing. One<br>
of the problems encountered is that of the high-frequency leakage currents.<br>
Due to inevitable, parasitic capacitances between the DC voltage generator<br>
and the ground, considerable equalizing currents creating an intolerable<br>
safety risk may occur in case of potential fluctuations so that complex<br>
monitoring measures using fault current sensors or the like are needed for<br>
contact protection or for establishing the electromagnetic compatibility<br>
(EMC) and said equalizing currents can only be securely avoided by<br>
grounding. Moreover, it is known that photovoltaic generators behave very<br>
 <br>
differently with respect to degradation, depending on which technology is<br>
used to manufacture them. Generators with crystalline and polycrystalline<br>
cells or certain thin film modules are preferably grounded with the negative<br>
terminal, whilst backside-contact cells are preferably grounded at the<br>
positive terminal.<br>
A grounding of the type described, through which the disadvantages<br>
mentioned could be avoided, is readily possible using DC voltage<br>
converters with transformers which cause the DC voltage side to<br>
galvanically separate from the AC voltage side. Irrespective of whether grid<br>
transformers or high-frequency transformers are being used, transformers<br>
result i.a. in a reduction of efficiency, in parts in considerable weight and<br>
overall size and/or in an additional control expense, which is the reason<br>
why transformerless voltage converters are in principle preferred. However,<br>
the usual topologies of transformerless DC voltage transformers either<br>
make the desired grounding impossible to perform since this grounding<br>
would lead to a short-circuit of needed switches, capacitances or the like or<br>
they result in increased circuit expense and other disadvantages.<br>
Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to avoid the mentioned<br>
disadvantages in another way. Circuits are known in particular, which serve<br>
the purpose of reducing the undesirable leakage currents (e.g., DE 10 2004<br>
037 466 A1, DE102 21 592 A1, DE 10 2004 030 912 B3). In these circuits,<br>
a solar generator e.g., is operated isolated from the grid in certain phases<br>
of internal electrical energy transport. When the solar generator is<br>
periodically electrically reconnected to the grid, its parasitic capacitances<br>
are only slightly reconverted so that the potential of the solar generator<br>
changes with grid frequency, sinusoidally and at a voltage amplitude that<br>
corresponds to half the grid voltage. High-frequency currents then form<br>
through the low voltage differences of the solar generator between two<br>
switching cycles only and through asymmetries during switching. Capacitive<br>
 <br>
leakage currents can thus be strongly minimized but cannot be avoided<br>
completely as a matter of principle.<br>
A circuit arrangement is further known (DE 102 25 020 A1), which uses a<br>
divided solar generator the center point of which is grounded. As a result,<br>
all the parts of the solar generator have a fixed potential and capacitive<br>
leakage currents cannot flow in principle. Since the two direct current<br>
sources have a different yield, a circuit for compensating the power<br>
differences and the voltages is additionally provided. In this proposed<br>
circuit, the disadvantage lies in the high voltage differences in the solar<br>
generator and at the switches, in the additional losses in the compensation<br>
circuit and in the fact that at least four high-frequency pulsed switches are<br>
needed.<br>
Besides, circuit arrangements have already been known by means of which<br>
a solar generator can be grounded on one side, in spite of the lack of a<br>
transformer. As a result, capacitive leakage currents are prevented as a<br>
matter of principle. One of these circuit arrangements (DE 196 42 522 C1)<br>
however needs five active switches, one or two switches having to switch<br>
simultaneously at high frequency and to provide the average output current.<br>
With this circuit, which is also referred to as "Flying Inductor", the efficiency<br>
is therefore affected by the high number of components participating<br>
simultaneously in series in the current flow. Another disadvantage of this<br>
circuit is that discontinuous current pulses are impressed upon the grid,<br>
which call for a capacitive mains filter which, as inherent to its functional<br>
principle, degrades the power factor but also the efficiency of the circuit in<br>
the part load range because of its own need for idle power. Although such a<br>
capacitive mains filter can be avoided with another known circuit (DE 197<br>
32 218 C1), nine active switches are needed therefor, of which at least two<br>
must be switched simultaneously at high frequencies so that the expense in<br>
terms of construction is even further increased and both the robustness and<br>
 <br>
the efficiency of the overall apparatus negatively affected. The topology of a<br>
Flying Inductor also has the disadvantage that the voltage load of the<br>
switches depends on the grid voltage and is sensitive to mains power<br>
failures and that it can only be operated in the three-phase mode of<br>
operation by three-fold use with the help of three inverters. Irrespective<br>
thereof, inverters with current source characteristics are needed, which is<br>
undesirable in many cases.<br>
Finally, apparatus are known (US 2007/0047277 A1), which are intended<br>
for inverters having a bipolar voltage intermediate circuit containing two<br>
series-connected capacitors connected together at a ground terminal. Such<br>
type inverters, which are nowadays mainly used for the purposes of interest<br>
herein, can be configured as half-bridge inverters in 3-level circuits and at<br>
need as inverters for one-phase or three-phase grid supply. In all of these<br>
cases, the connection node between the two capacitors forms a ground<br>
terminal that is associated with the zero or neutral conductor of the<br>
respective grid and is connected therewith.<br>
The DC voltage converter of this known apparatus contains one choke, two<br>
diodes and one switch. In this case, the ground terminal of the inverter can<br>
be connected to the negative output of the DC voltage generator. This is<br>
made possible using a storage choke that is composed of two magnetically<br>
coupled coils. The two coils of this storage choke are galvanicaliy<br>
connected together at one end in such a manner that on the one side, when<br>
the switch is closed, one of the two coils is charged by the DC voltage<br>
generator and the other coil via the first coil by virtue of the magnetic<br>
coupling and that, on the other side, when the switch is open, the two coils<br>
are discharged via a respective one, associated, of the two capacitors and<br>
via a diode belonging thereto.<br>
 <br>
The advantage that this apparatus makes it possible to ground the DC<br>
voltage generator with relatively simple means, in particular without any<br>
transformer and with only one switch, is offset by the disadvantage that the<br>
ground terminal can only be connected to the negative output of the DC<br>
voltage converter. Further, this apparatus does not allow for monitoring the<br>
ground line leading from the ground terminal to the DC voltage generator<br>
with respect to fault currents since, as a matter of principle, operating<br>
currents also flow in this ground line.<br>
A circuit with a power storage choke and two switches connected in series<br>
therewith is known from JP 11 235024 A1. On the output voltage side, there<br>
are provided two diodes in order to decouple the input and the output. A<br>
DC-AC converter with a negative and a positive input and a three-phase AC<br>
output is used. Grounding is provided neither at the input nor at the output<br>
of the DC-AC converter. It is not mentioned whether the DC-AC converter is<br>
transformerless. At the output of the DC-DC circuit, there is only provided<br>
one single capacitor. Through this circuit, bidirectional operation of a DC-<br>
DC converter can be provided.<br>
In view of this prior art, the technical problem of the invention is to configure<br>
the apparatus of the type mentioned herein above, and in particular a DC<br>
voltage converter suited therefor, in such a manner that it is possible to<br>
ground the DC voltage generator at any terminal and that this can be<br>
realized with relatively simple construction means.<br>
In accordance with the invention the solution to this problem is achieved<br>
with the characterizing features of the claims 1 and 16.<br>
The invention allows for grounded operation of the DC voltage generator by<br>
using a DC voltage converter which, in the simplest case, only needs one<br>
storage choke, two diodes and two switches. As a result, in spite of only<br>
 <br>
slightly increased expense, the advantage is obtained that the DC voltage<br>
generator can be grounded almost anywhere.<br>
Other advantageous features of the invention will become apparent from<br>
the dependent claims.<br>
The invention will be understood better upon reading the exemplary<br>
description accompanying the appended drawings wherein<br>

Fig. 11 through 13 different types of inverters, which may be operated with<br>
the DC voltage converter of the invention as an alternative to<br>
the inverter shown in the Figs. 1 through 3.<br>
According to Fig. 1, an apparatus for generating electrical energy contains<br>
a DC voltage generator 1, a DC voltage converter 2 and an inverter 3. The<br>
DC voltage generator 1 consists e.g., of a photovoltaic or fuel cell plant and<br>
 <br>
comprises at the outputs 4 (+) and 5 (-) a capacitor C that is connected in<br>
parallel therewith.<br>
A preferred inverter 3 within the scope of the present application comprises<br>
two outputs 6 and 7 which serve herein for single phase supply of electrical<br>
energy into a grid 8 the phase L of which is connected with the output 6 and<br>
the zero or neutral conductor N of which is connected with the output 7. The<br>
inverter 3 moreover contains three inputs E1, E2 and E3. Between the<br>
inputs E1 and E2, there are disposed two series connected capacitors C1<br>
and C2 the connection node of which lies at the input E3. The capacitors<br>
C1 and C2 form a usual bipolar voltage intermediate circuit of the inverter 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the inverter 3 is configured to be a half bridge inverter<br>
and is provided for this purpose with two switches S1 and S2 the one<br>
terminal of which is respectively connected with a respective one of the<br>
inputs E1 and E2 and the other terminal of which leads to a common<br>
connection node 9 and from there to the output 6, via a smoothing or grid<br>
choke L1. A diode D1, D2 is additionally connected in parallel with a<br>
respective one of the two switches S1, S2; the diode D1 can thereby be<br>
made conductive from the connection node 9 in the direction of the input E1<br>
and the diode D2 from the input E3 in the direction of the connection node<br>
9, said diodes closing respectively in the opposite direction. Finally, the<br>
input E3 is directly connected with the output 7, grounded on the other side<br>
and configured to be a ground terminal as a result thereof.<br>
The inverter 3 substantially operates as follows: if the switches S1, S2 are<br>
alternately switched on and off, the side (input E1) which is positive with<br>
respect to E3 of the capacitor C1 is connected to phase L via the<br>
connection node 9 and the grid choke L1 e.g., during the positive half wave<br>
of the switch signal (switch S1 at first closed, switch S2 open). When the<br>
switch S1 opens next, the current can continue to flow through the grid<br>
choke L1, the capacitor C2 and the diode D2. During the negative half wave<br>
 <br>
of the grid 8 (switch S1 open, switch S2 at first closed), the side (input E2)<br>
of the capacitor C2, which is negative with respect to E3, is connected to<br>
the phase L via the connection node 9 and the choke L1, the current being<br>
allowed to continue to flow through the diode D1 and the capacitor C1 after<br>
the switch S2 has closed. The two capacitors C1, C2 are discharged<br>
alternately as a result thereof, they being recharged in a known way with<br>
the help of any suited DC voltage converter.<br>
Apparatus of the type described are generally known (e.g., US<br>
2007/0047277 A1, Fig. 10) and need therefore not be described in detail to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a DC voltage converter 2 of the invention contains two<br>
inputs 10 and 11, which are connected to the two outputs 4 and 5 of the DC<br>
voltage generator, as well as three outputs 12, 13 and 14 which are<br>
connected to the inputs E1, E2 and E3 of the inverter 3. At the input 10<br>
there is connected a switch S3, which leads to a connection node 15. The<br>
one terminal of a storage choke 16 is connected to this connection node 15,<br>
the other terminal of said storage choke being located at a connection node<br>
17 that is connected with the input 11 via a second switch S4. Moreover,<br>
the connection node 17 is connected to the output 12 via a first diode D3<br>
whilst the output 13 leads to the connection node 15 via a second diode D4.<br>
The diode D3 can be made conductive in the direction of the output 12, the<br>
diode D4 in the direction of the connection node 15, whilst both are closing<br>
in the respective opposite direction. As a result, the functioning principle of<br>
the DC voltage converter 2 is as follows:<br>
When the switches S3 and S4 are closed at the same time, the storage<br>
choke 16 is recharged by the DC voltage generator 1 or by its capacitor C.<br>
The switch S3, the storage choke 16 and the switch S4 form a first series<br>
electric circuit that serves for storing electrical energy in the storage choke<br>
 <br>
16. At this time, the diodes D3 and D4 prevent the current flow to or from<br>
the capacitors C1 and C2. If, by contrast, the two switches S3 and S4 are<br>
opened simultaneously, the storage choke 16 discharges via the diode D3,<br>
the series-connected capacitors C1 and C2 and the diode D4. In this<br>
phase, the storage choke 16 forms, together with the parts D3, C1, C2 and<br>
D4, a second series electric circuit intended for discharging the storage<br>
choke 16 or for accordingly recharging the capacitors C1, C2. If the two<br>
capacitors C1, C2 have the same capacitance, they are charged to the<br>
same voltage UC1 = UC2.<br>
In their opened condition, the voltage load of the switches S3, S4 is<br>
relatively small. When the diodes D3 and D4 are conductive, the voltage at<br>
the switch S3 is US3 = UC + UC2 at the most, wherein UC is the output<br>
voltage of the DC voltage generator 1. The voltage at the switch S4, by<br>
contrast, is US4 = UC1 at the most.<br>
Irrespective thereof, the DC voltage converter 2 described offers the<br>
advantage that the DC voltage generator 1 can be operated with a relatively<br>
large range of output voltages. If the DC voltage converter 2 were missing,<br>
it should be made certain that the DC voltage generator 1 always supplies<br>
the inputs E1 and E2, even under unfavourable conditions, with such a high<br>
output voltage that the capacitors C1 and C2 are charged to a voltage that<br>
is higher than the grid amplitude (usually about ± 325 V). If, by contrast, a<br>
boost DC voltage converter 2 is provided, the voltages at the capacitors C1,<br>
C2 can be set to the desired height by selecting the pulse-duty factor at<br>
which the switches S3 and S4 are operated even if the output voltage of the<br>
DC voltage generator 1 is lower than the voltage at least needed by the<br>
inverter 3 (or by the grid 8).<br>
Further, the apparatus described is very flexible in utilization. This results<br>
from the fact that the voltages at C1 and C2 may be both higher and lower<br>
 <br>
than the input voltage at the capacitor C, depending on the selected pulse<br>
duty factor for S3 and S4. If the pulse duty factor is more than 0.5, the DC<br>
voltage converter operates in the boost mode of operation. If the pulse duty<br>
factor is less than 0.5, the DC voltage converter 2 operates in the buck<br>
mode of operation. A pulse duty factor of 0.5 practically results in the<br>
voltage applied at the output of the DC voltage generator 1 being fed<br>
directly. The maximum voltage load of the inverter switches S1 and S2 is<br>
about 2 • UC1, wherein UC1 is the maximum voltage at the capacitor C1. In<br>
the simplest case, it is also possible to always have only one of these<br>
switches switched at high-frequency for each half mains period, whilst the<br>
other one remains switched off. Moreover, a continuous current flow into<br>
the grid 8 is possible on the inverter side.<br>
A major advantage of the invention is finally obtained in that the grounding<br>
point E3 can be connected optionally with the input 11 of the DC voltage<br>
converter 2 and as a resuit thereof with the negative output 5 (Fig. 1), with<br>
the input 10 of the DC voltage converter 2 and as a result thereof with the<br>
positive output 5 (Fig. 2) or with any other terminal 18 (Fig. 3) of the DC<br>
voltage generator 1, as this also applies for the neutral conductor N of the<br>
grid 8. During normal operation, no current flows through a grounding line<br>
19 (Fig. 1) or 20 (Fig. 2) or 21 (Fig. 3), which is respectively shown in a<br>
dashed line and which connects the grounding point E3 with the<br>
corresponding input of the DC voltage converter 2 or with the<br>
corresponding output of the DC voltage generator 1. This results in<br>
particular from the fact that, together with the parts E3, C1, C2 and D4, the<br>
storage choke 16 forms an electric circuit, which is closed in itself and does<br>
not contain the lines 19, 20 or 21. As a result, it may be concluded that<br>
there is a fault in the plant if current still flows in the line 19, 20 or 21. In<br>
accordance with the invention, a monitoring element in the form of a circuit<br>
breaker or the like is preferably disposed in the line 19, 20 or 21 for<br>
automatically switching off the plant when a preselected tolerable current<br>
 <br>
peak is exceeded. This function is independent on which input of the DC<br>
voltage converter 2 or which output of the DC voltage generator 1 the<br>
ground terminal E3 is connected to.<br>
In a known way, the switches S1 through S4 are practically configured to be<br>
semiconductor switches that may be switched on and off periodically when<br>
operated with control units that have not been illustrated herein<br>
(microcontrollers, PWM controls and so on), the switch frequency being<br>
e.g., 16 kHz or more.<br>
The signals for activating the switches S3 and S4 and the current path in<br>
the storage choke 16 are illustrated by way of example in Fig. 4. It can be<br>
seen therefrom that the two switches S3, S4 are always switched on and off<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an exemplary embodiment that has been modified over Fig. 1<br>
through 3 insofar as the storage choke 16 is divided into two coil parts W11<br>
and W12 through a central terminal or a coil tap 23. In this case, the<br>
arrangement is such that the connection node 15 is connected to the tap 23<br>
and that, as a result thereof, only the part W11 of the storage choke 16,<br>
which is fixed by the tap 23, lies in the first electric circuit which serves to<br>
charge the storage choke 16, whilst the second electric circuit contains the<br>
entire storage choke 16 located between the diodes D4 and D3 or the part<br>
W11 + W12 thereof. As a result, one may tap another optimization potential<br>
of the arrangement of the invention for the relationship between input<br>
voltage and output voltage, the load of the switch S3 and the diodes D3 and<br>
D4. If the transmission ratio is higher, one has the possibility, beside the<br>
pulse duty factor for S3 and S4, to influence the effective current and<br>
voltage load of the component parts via the relation (W12 + W11): W11. In<br>
principle, the location of the tap 23 can be chosen ad lib. A particular<br>
advantage of the tap 23 is that the maximum voltage load at the switch S3<br>
 <br>
in the open condition is only given by the voltage US3 = UC + [- n/(n + 1)] •<br>
UC1 + UC2, wherein n = W12/W11 and W11 and W12 simultaneously refer<br>
to the number of windings of the coils W11 and W12. The voltage load at<br>
the switch S4 is US4 = UC1. Alternatively, it is also possible to connect the<br>
tap 23 with the switch S4 in analogous fashion. For the rest, the apparatus<br>
shown in Fig. 5 corresponds to that shown in the Figs. 1 through 3, this<br>
being the reason why the output 14 of the DC voltage converter 2 may be<br>
connected optionally with the output 4 or 5 or with any other output of the<br>
DC voltage generator 1.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the Figs. 6<br>
and 7. This embodiment differs from the one shown in the Figs. 1 through 5<br>
in particular in that the advantages described are obtained herein with a<br>
coupled storage choke 24, which is known per se but which is electrically<br>
connected in a hitherto unknown way. The storage choke 24 contains a first<br>
coil W1 and a second one W2 which are magnetically coupled together and<br>
are for example wound on a common core 25 for this purpose.<br>
Like the choke coil 16 in Fig. 1, the first coil W1 is electrically interposed<br>
between the two switches S3, S4 or between the two connection nodes 15<br>
and 17. Moreover, the connection node 17 is connected to the output 12 via<br>
the diode D3 like in Fig. 1. By contrast, the input 13 of the DC voltage<br>
converter 2 is connected via a diode D5 to a terminal of the coil W2 the<br>
other terminal of which leads to the connection node 15 via a connection<br>
node 26 and a diode D6. Moreover, the connection node 26 is connected to<br>
the output 14. With this provision, the functioning is as follows:<br>
The first coil W1 of the storage choke 24 forms, together with the two<br>
switches S3, S4, a first series electric circuit that is placed in parallel with<br>
the outputs 4,5 of the DC voltage generator 1 and serves for charging the<br>
coil W1 with electrical energy when the switches S3, S4 are closed. Since<br>
 <br>
the two coils W1, W2 are magnetically coupled, the coil W2 is also charged<br>
in this phase via the coil W1. The sense of winding of the two coils W1, W2<br>
is thereby chosen so as to obtain the same voltage polarities at terminals<br>
which are shown by dots in Fig. 6.<br>
In the open condition of the switches S3, S4, the two coils W1, W2 lie in a<br>
second series electric circuit that leads from one of the terminals of the coil<br>
W1 (connection node 17), via the diode D3, the series-mounted capacitors<br>
C1 and C2, the diode D5, the coil W2, the connection node 26 and the<br>
diode D6 back to the other terminal of the coil W1 (connection node 15).<br>
Like in the case shown in Fig. 1, this second electric circuit is an electric<br>
circuit that is closed in itself and serves to jointly discharge the coils W1,<br>
W2 or to jointly charge the capacitors C1, C2. Moreover, the two coils W1,<br>
W2 are galvanically connected together through this electric circuit.<br>
As a result of this arrangement, it is possible to optionally connect the<br>
output 14 of the DC voltage converter 2 or the output E3 of the inverter 3<br>
through the line 19 (Fig. 6), or the line 20 (Fig. 7) to the input 11 or 10 of the<br>
DC voltage converter 2 and, as a result thereof, also optionally to the output<br>
5 or 4 of the DC voltage generator 1, in order to ground it at the negative<br>
output 5 (Fig. 6) or at the positive output 4 (Fig. 7). Moreover, the input E3<br>
could be connected, analogous to Fig. 3, to any central output of the DC<br>
voltage generator 1. In all the cases described, these lines 19, 20 and, if<br>
applicable, 21 are not in use in normal operation since no current is allowed<br>
to flow through these lines 19 through 21 neither during charging nor during<br>
discharging of the storage choke 16. As a result, like in the case illustrated<br>
in the Figs. 1 through 5, a still measured current flow in these lines 19<br>
through 21 or between the grounding point E3 and one of the terminals 4, 5<br>
or 18 would be indicative of a fault in the plant or in the DC voltage<br>
converter 2 and could be used to switch off the plant.<br>
 <br>
An advantage of the apparatus shown in Fig. 6 over the apparatus shown in<br>
the Figs. 1 through 3 results from the lower voltage load of the switch S3.<br>
Since the diode D6 is conductive during the blocking phase of the switches<br>
S3 and S4, the maximum voltage applied at switch S3 is the voltage UC,<br>
whilst the voltage UC1 is applied at S4 since the diode D3 is also<br>
conductive. In the apparatus shown in Fig. 7, by contrast, the voltage load<br>
at the switch S3 is equal to zero and at the switch S4 to UC + UC1.<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention that has not<br>
been illustrated separately the coil W1 of the choke coil 16 can be divided<br>
into two parts by a tap, in analogous fashion to Fig. 5. Like in Fig. 5, it is<br>
thereby possible to connect the tap to one of the connection nodes 15, 17<br>
while disposing the two coil parts in the second electric circuit. At need, the<br>
voltage load of the switch S3 of the exemplary embodiment shown in the<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 is further reduced as a result thereof.<br>
The magnetic coupling of the coils W1, W2 in the Figs. 6 and 7 is preferably<br>
obtained by the fact that they are wound on one common core, above each<br>
other or behind each other according to need. Preferably, they have the<br>
same number of windings and are practically wound on the core 25 in<br>
opposing senses of winding in the arrangement schematically shown in the<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 in order to obtain the right directions of the current flow during<br>
charging and discharging.<br>
The Figs. 8 through 10 show how the DC voltage converter 2, herein<br>
specially the DC voltage converter 2 shown in the Figs. 6 and 7, can be<br>
configured to be a component part 27 that is provided with a plurality of<br>
terminals configured to be plug contacts or the like. As shown in Fig. 8, the<br>
DC voltage converter 2 has, unlike in the Figs. 6 and 7, in addition to the<br>
inputs 10, 11 and the outputs 12, 13, four additional outputs 28, 29, 30 and<br>
31 and no output 14. The terminal 28 is directly connected to the input 10,<br>
 <br>
the terminal 31, to input 11. Further, the terminal 29 is connected to the<br>
terminal of the coil W2 that is remote from the diode D5 and the terminal<br>
30, to the connection node 26, this terminal not communicating with point<br>
26 in Fig. 8. Through suited connections, the grounding of the DC voltage<br>
generator 1 may now be optionally provided at the negative terminal 5 (Fig.<br>
9) or at the positive terminal 4 (Fig. 10).<br>
If grounding is desired to occur at the negative output 5, the terminal 31 is<br>
grounded as shown in Fig. 9 and is connected to the input E3 of the inverter<br>
3 and as a result thereof to the neutral conductor N of the grid 8 via a<br>
monitoring element 32. Moreover, the terminals 29 and 30 are connected<br>
together. As a result, one obtains the arrangement shown in Fig. 6 if, to<br>
utilize the component 27, one connects the outputs 4, 5 of the DC voltage<br>
generator 1 to its inputs 10 and 11, its outputs 12 and 13 to the inputs E1,<br>
E2 of the inverter 3 and its terminals 29, 30 jointly to the input E3 of the<br>
inverter 3.<br>
If, by contrast, grounding is desired to occur at the positive output of the DC<br>
voltage generator 1, the terminal 28 is grounded as shown in Fig. 10 and is<br>
connected to the input E3 of the inverter 3 via the monitoring element 32.<br>
The other connections occur like in Fig. 9. By merely re-plugging the<br>
terminals 28, 31 of the component part 27 or of the DC voltage converter 2<br>
located therein one has the option to choose to ground the DC voltage<br>
generator 1 at the positive or at the negative output 4, 5. Other outputs of<br>
the component part 27 could serve to ground also central terminals of the<br>
DC voltage generator 1.<br>
The same procedure is followed when using the DC voltage converter<br>
shown in the Figs. 1 through 5.<br>
Although the description given herein above only refers to the inverter 3<br>
 <br>
configured to be a half bridge inverter, it is clear to those skilled in the art<br>
that other inverters with a bipolar voltage intermediate circuit can be<br>
connected to the DC voltage converter 2 of the invention. This is<br>
schematically shown in the Figs. 11 through 13. Fig. 11 shows a half bridge<br>
inverter in a 3-level circuit, Fig. 12 another inverter in a 3-level circuit with<br>
center point (each in a single-phase implementation) and Fig. 13 shows an<br>
inverter for 3-phase grid 8 supply. All the three inverters have a bipolar<br>
voltage intermediate circuit, the inputs E1 through E3 and the outputs 6, 7<br>
correspond to the above description. Since such type inverters are known<br>
per se, it seems that they need not be discussed further herein.<br>
The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described, which<br>
can be varied in various ways. This applies in particular insofar as the<br>
inverters 3 and the DC voltage converters 2 are preferably manufactured<br>
and sold as a finished structural unit as shown in the drawings, but they can<br>
also be manufactured and sold as separate component parts. The<br>
embodiments described referring to the Figs. 8 through 10 are particularly<br>
suited therefor since they make it possible to mass-produce universally<br>
utilizable DC voltage converters which are independent on the kind of<br>
grounding of the DC voltage converter 1 desired in a particular case.<br>
Accordingly, the invention not only relates to the combination of a DC<br>
voltage converter 2 and of an inverter 3, but also to the DC voltage<br>
converter 2 alone. It is further clear that in the above specification only<br>
those component parts were described that are needed to garner an<br>
understanding of the invention, and that in particular the required and<br>
actually known control units, MPP controls and so on can be additionally<br>
provided. Also, it is understood that the various features can also be used<br>
in other combinations as those described and illustrated.<br>
