				<td>The present invention relates to compounds of<br>
general formula (I)<br>
in which<br>
U represents<br>
A) either a 2,3-dihydro-lH-inden-2-yl group of general<br>
formula (A)<br>
B) or a heterocyclic group of general formula (B)<br>
in which<br>
V represents a hydrogen or halogen atom, a (C1-C3)alkyl<br>
group or one or two (C1-C3) alkoxy groups,<br>
W and X each represent, respectively, either two oxygen<br>
atoms, or an oxygen atom and a CH2 group, or a CH2 group<br>
and an oxygen atom, or an oxygen atom and a CO group,<br>
n represents the number 0 or 1,<br>
R represents either a propyl group when U represents a<br>
2,3-dihydro-lH-inden-2-yl group of general formula (A),<br>
or a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C3)alkyl group when U<br>
represents a heterocyclic group of general formula (B),<br>
Y represents one or more atoms or groups chosen from<br>
the following: hydrogen, halogen, (C1-C3)alkyl and<br>
(C1-C3)alkoxy,<br>
Z represents two hydrogen atoms or an oxygen atom.<br>
The compounds of the invention can exist in<br>
two forms of geometrical isomers, namely the a, or<br>
endo, isomeric form in which the CH2 group in the 3<br>
position of the tropane ring-system (azabicyclooctane)<br>
is in an axial position, and the b, or exo, isomeric<br>
form in which the said CH2 group is in an equatorial<br>
position, in the so-called "chair" conformation of the<br>
piperidine unit of the tropane ring-system.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also exist<br>
in the form of bases or of addition salts with acids.<br>
When U represents a 2,3-dihydro-lH-inden-2-yl<br>
group of general formula (A), the compounds of the<br>
invention correspond to the general formula (IA)<br>
They can be prepared according to a process<br>
illustrated by Scheme 1A which follows.<br>
Ethyl 6- (phenylmethyl) -8-az.abicyclo [3 . 2 .1] -<br>
octane-3-carboxylate of formula (IIA) is reacted with a<br>
dimethylaluminium amide, prepared beforehand from<br>
trimethylaluminium and a 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2-amine<br>
derivative of general formula (IIIA), in which V is as<br>
defined above, in an inert solvent, for example<br>
toluene, at a temperature of from 0 to 100°C; a<br>
compound of general formula (IVA) is obtained, which is<br>
reduced by the action of a mixed alkali metal hydride<br>
such as lithium aluminium hydride, in an ether solvent,<br>
for example tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from 0<br>
to 60°C, to give a compound of general formula (VA).<br>
This compound is subjected to an acylation using<br>
propanoyl chloride, in a chlorinated solvent, for<br>
example dichloromethane, in the presence of a base such<br>
as triethylamine, at a temperature of from o to 40°C,<br>
to give an amide of general formula (VIA} , which is<br>
reduced by the action of a mixed alkali metal hydride<br>
such as lithium aluminium hydride, in an ether solvent,<br>
for example tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from 0<br>
to 60°C, to give a compound of general formula (Ia)<br>
which corresponds to the general formula (IA) when Y<br>
represents a hydrogen atom and Z represents two<br>
hydrogen atoms. To prepare another compound of general<br>
formula (IA), debenzylation is then carried out, for<br>
example by catalytic hydrogenation, to give the amine<br>
of general formula (VIIA), and finally this amine is<br>
reacted either with an acid chloride of general formula<br>
(VIIIA) in which Y is as defined above, Z represents an<br>
oxygen atom and T represents a chlorine atom, in a<br>
chlorinated solvent, for example dichloromethane, in<br>
the presence of a base such as triethylamine, at a<br>
temperature of from 20 to 40oC, or with a halogenated<br>
derivative of general formula (VIIIA) in which Y is as<br>
defined above, Z represents two hydrogen atoms and T<br>
represents a halogen atom, in an aprotic solvent, for<br>
example N, N-dimethylformamide , in the presence of a<br>
base such as potassium carbonate, at a temperature of<br>
from 20 to 100°C.<br>
The 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2-amine of general<br>
formula (IIIA) in which X represents hydrogen is<br>
commercially available; the substituted derivatives of<br>
2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2-amine of general formula (IIIA)<br>
can be prepared by methods analogous to those described<br>
in Can. J. Chem. (1974) 52 381-389.<br>
The ethyl 8-(phenylmethyl)-8-<br>
azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylate of formula (IIA)<br>
can be prepared by a method analogous to that described<br>
in J. Med. Chem. (1994) 37 2831.<br>
When U represents a heterocyclic group of<br>
general formula (B), the compounds of the invention<br>
correspond to the general formula (IB)<br>
They can be prepared according to processes<br>
illustrated by Schemes 1B to 3B which follow .<br>
According to Schemes IBa, IBb and IBc, the<br>
compounds of general formula (IB1, in vhich W and x<br>
each represent an oxygen atom and n represents the<br>
number 1, are prepared by reacting ethyl<br>
8- (phenylmethyl) - B-azabicyclo [3.2.1] -octane-3-<br>
carboxylate of formula (IIA) with a dimethylaluminium<br>
amide, prepared beforehand from trmethylaluminium and<br>
a 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benodioxane-2-methanamine derivative<br>
of general formula (IIB), in which V is as defined<br>
above, in an inert solvent such as toluene, at a<br>
temperature of from o to 100°c, to give a compound of<br>
general formula (IVB) , which is reduced by the action<br>
of a mixed alkali metal hydride, for example lithium<br>
aluminium hydride, in an ether solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from 0 to 60oC.<br>
A compound of general formula (IBa) which<br>
corresponds to the general formula (IB) where R and Y<br>
each represent a hydrogen atom and Z represents two<br>
hydrogen atoms is obtained.<br>
If a final compound is desired, in the<br>
general formula of which R represents a hydrogen atom<br>
or an alkyl group, the compound of general formula<br>
(IBa) is then treated by one of the processes<br>
illustrated by Schemes IBb or IBc.<br>
Scheme IBb begins by protecting the secondary<br>
amine function of the compound of general formula (IBa)<br>
by the action of bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) dicarbonate, in<br>
a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane, to give<br>
a compound of general formula (VB), in which Boc<br>
represents a 1,1-dimethylethoxycarbonyl group. This<br>
compound is debenzylated by catalytic hydrogenation and<br>
the compound thus obtained, of general formula (VIB),<br>
is then reacted with an acid. chloride of general<br>
formula (VIIB) in which Y is as defined above and Hal<br>
represents a chlorine atom, in a chlorinated solvent,<br>
for example dichloromethane, in the presence of a base<br>
such as triethylamine, at a temperature of from 20 to<br>
40oC. A compound of general formula (VIIIB) is<br>
obtained, the secondary amine function of which is<br>
deprotected using trifluoroacetic acid to give a<br>
compound of general<br>
formula (IBb).<br>
Finally, and if so desired, this compound is<br>
reduced by the action of a mixed alkali metal hydride,<br>
for example lithium aluminium hydride, in an ether<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran., to give a compound of<br>
general formula (IBa).<br>
In Scheme IBc, a compound of general formula.<br>
(IBa) is subjected to an acylation using an acetic-<br>
forming mixed anhydride or a C1-C3 acid chloride, in a<br>
chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane. at a<br>
temperature of from 0 to 40°C, to give a compound of<br>
general formula (IXB) , in which R' represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, and this<br>
acylated compound is then reduced using a mixed alkali-<br>
metal hydride, for example lithium aluminium hydride,<br>
in an ether solvent such as tetrahydrocuran. to give a<br>
compound of general formula (IBd), in which R"<br>
represents a (C1-C3) alkyl group.<br>
This compound is then, treated as indicated<br>
with regard to the compound of general formula (VB),<br>
with the exception, of course, of the amine<br>
deprotection step.<br>
In Scheme 2B, the compounds of general<br>
formula (IB), in which X represents an oxygen atom, W<br>
represents an oxygen atom or a CH2 group, R represents a<br>
hydrogen atom and n represents the number 1, are<br>
prepared by reacting a compound of general formula<br>
(XIB) , in whicn V is as defined above and C represents<br>
a leaving group such as a halogen atom or a<br>
methanesulphonyloxy or 4-methylbenzenesulphonyloxy<br>
group, with an 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1] octane-3-amine of<br>
general formula (XIIB), in which Y, 2 and R are as<br>
defined above, in a solvent such as acetonitrile, in<br>
the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
In Scheme 3B, the compounds of general<br>
formula (IB), in which X represents a CO group, w<br>
represents an oxygen atom, R represents a hydrogen atom<br>
and n represents the number 1, are prepared by reacting<br>
a compound, of general formula (XIIIB) in which V is as<br>
defined above, with paraformaldehyde and an<br>
a-azabicyclo[3.2.1] octane-3-amine of general formula<br>
(XIIB), in which Y, Z and R are as defined above, in a<br>
solvent such as 2-propanol, in the presence of a<br>
catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid.<br>
The starting compounds to be used in the<br>
processes illustrated by Schemes IB to 3B are<br>
commercially available or can be prepared according to<br>
methods identical or analogous to those described in<br>
the literature, in particular in patent applications<br>
EP-0,193,400 and EP-0,013,139 and in J. Med. Chem.<br>
(1983), 26 823, J. Med. Chem. (1989) 12 1402, and J.<br>
Med. Chem. (1994) 37 2831.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the<br>
preparation of a number of compounds of the invention.<br>
The elemental dicroanalyses and the IR and NMR spectra<br>
confirm the structures of the compounds obtained.<br>
The numbers indicated in parentheses in the<br>
example titles correspond to those in the 1st column of<br>
Tables A and B given later.<br>
In the compound names, the hyphen " -" forms<br>
part of the name, and the underscore line "_" serves<br>
merely to indicate the line break; it should be removed<br>
if a line break does not occur at that point and should<br>
not be replaced either with a normal hyphen or with a<br>
space.<br>

The compounds of the invention underwent a<br>
series of pharmacological tests which revealed their<br>
value as therapeutically active substances.<br>
Study of the affinity for D-type doeaminerais recptors<br>
in rat etriatum.<br>
The compounds displace the binding of a<br>
specific labelled ligand, spiperone (referred to<br>
hereinbelow as " [3H] spiperone" and described by Briley<br>
and Langer., Ear. J. Pharmacal (1978) 50, 283), on<br>
the Dz receptors present in rat striatum.<br>
The animals used are 150 to 250 g male<br>
Sprague Dawley rats. After decapitation, the brain is<br>
removed and the striatum is excised. The tissue is<br>
ground using a Polytron™ grinder in 50 volumes of 50 mM<br>
Tris-HCl buffer containing sodium chloride (120 mM),<br>
potassium chloride (5 mM) and the pH of which is<br>
adjusted to 7.4 (i.e. 100 mg of fresh tissue per 5 ml) .<br>
The homogenized tissues are washed twice at 4°C,<br>
centrifuging them each time for 10 min at 40,000 x g<br>
and resuspending the pellet in fresh cooled buffer.<br>
Lastly, the final pellet is suspended in the same<br>
volume of buffer and ascorbic acid (0.1% final<br>
concentration) and pargyline (10 mM final<br>
concentration) are added. The mixture is then incubated<br>
at 37°C for 10 min.<br>
The binding of [3H] spiperone (New England<br>
Nuclear, specific activity 20-40 mCi/mmol) is<br>
determined by incubating 100 ml of the membrane<br>
suspension with the radioligand (0.25 nM) in a final<br>
volume of 1 ml, for 20 minutes at 37°C, in the presence<br>
or absence of the test compound. The non-specific<br>
binding is determined in the presence of haloperidol at<br>
the concentration of 10 mM. After incubation, the<br>
membranes are recovered by filtration on Whatman GF/B™<br>
filters, which are washed with two volumes of 5 ml of<br>
ice-cold buffer. The filters are extracted in the<br>
scintillation liquid and the radioactivity is measured<br>
by liquid scintigraphy with an efficacy of 50 to 60%.<br>
For each test compound, the results are expressed by<br>
the IC60, that is to say by the concentration which<br>
inhibits the binding of [3H]spiperone by 50%, calculated<br>
by a graphical or mathematical method.<br>
For the compounds of the invention, the IC50<br>
values are between 0.05 and 2 mM.<br>
Study of the affinity for the D, doparnineraic receptors<br>
in bovine noyau caude<br>
The compounds underwent an in vitro study<br>
regarding their affinity for the D3 dopaminergic<br>
receptors obtained from a membrane preparation of<br>
bovine noyau caude, essentially as described by<br>
Schoemaker H. in Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1993), 242, R1-R2.<br>
On the day of the experiment, the bovine<br>
noyaux caudes (Collect Organe, Paris, France), stored<br>
at -80oC, are thawed and homogenized at 4oC in 10<br>
volumes of buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 at<br>
25oC) using a PolytroonTM (position 5, 30 s) . The<br>
homogenate is centrifuged at 2500 g for 1 min (Sorvall™<br>
centrifuge fitted with an SS34 rator). The supernatant<br>
is recovered and centrifuged at 35,000 g for 15 min,<br>
the pellet is washed by resuspension in 10 volumes of<br>
buffer, homogenization and centrifugation, and the<br>
final pellet is suspended in 10 volumes of buffer and<br>
preincubated at 37oC for 10 min.<br>
The homogenate is centrifuged at 35,000 g for<br>
15 min and the pellet is resuspended in the incubation<br>
buffer (50 mM HepES, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM B-hydroxy-<br>
quinoline, 0.005% ascorbic acid, pH 7.5 at 25oC) in a<br>
proportion of 100 mh of initial tissue per ml.<br>
The membrane suspension (150 ml) is incubated<br>
at 23oC for 60 min in tubes, in the presence of 0.8 nM<br>
[3H]7-OH-DPAT (specific activity 120-160 Ci/mmol,<br>
Amersham™) in a final volume of 1 ml of incubation<br>
buffer containing 0.2 mM zolpidem hydrochloride and<br>
1 mg of bovine serum albumin, in the presence or<br>
absence of test compound. The incubation is stopped by<br>
filtration on a Brandel Harvester M-48™, using Whatman<br>
GF/CTM filters pretreated with bovine serum albumin<br>
(0.1%) for 30 min. After predilution with 4 ml of<br>
buffer (50 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, pH 7.4 at<br>
25°C) of each reaction medium, the tubes are rinsed<br>
twice with 4 ml of this buffer.<br>
The filters are cut up and then dried in an<br>
oven at 120 °C for 10 min and the radioactivity retained<br>
on the filters is determined by liquid scintillation.<br>
spectrometry. The non-specific binding is determined in<br>
the presence of 1 mM of dopamine.<br>
For feach concentration of test compound, the<br>
percentage of inhibition of specific binding of the<br>
[3H] 7-OH-DFAT is calculated, after which the IC50, the<br>
concentration which inhibits the binding by 50% is<br>
determined.<br>
The IC50 values of the compounds of the<br>
invention are of the order of 0.01 mM to 2 mM<br>
Study of the affinity for 5-HT1A-type serotonsnerqic<br>
receptors<br>
The compounds displace the binding of a<br>
specific labelled ligand, [3H]-8-hydroxy-2-di-n-<br>
propylamino tetraline (referred to hereinbelow as " [3H] -<br>
8-OH-DPAT" and described by Gozlan et al., Nature<br>
(1983), 305, 140), on the 5-HT1A receptors present in<br>
rat hippocampus.<br>
The animals used are 160 to 200 g male<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats. After decapitation, the brain is<br>
removed and the hippocampus is excised.. The tissue is<br>
ground in an Ultra-Turrax Polytron™ machine for 30 s at<br>
the half-maximal speed in 10 volumes of 50 mM Tris<br>
buffer of pH adjusted to 7.4 with hydrochloric acid<br>
(i.e. 100 mg of fresh tissue per ml). The homogenized<br>
tissues are washed twice at 4°C, centrifuging them each<br>
time for 10 min at 48,000 x g and resuspending the<br>
pellet in fresh cooled buffer. Lastly, the final pellet<br>
is suspended in the buffer to give a concentration of<br>
50 mg of starting tissue per ml of buffer at 50 mM. The<br>
mixture is then incubated at 37°C for 10 min.<br>
The binding with [3H] 8-OH-DPAT (1 nM) xs<br>
determined by incubation of 50 ml of membrane<br>
suspension in a final volume of 250 ml of buffer<br>
containing 10 mM of pargyline and 3 mM of paroxetine.<br>
After incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the membranes are<br>
recovered by filtration on Whatman GF/B™ filters, which<br>
are washed three times with 5 ml aliquots of ice-cold<br>
buffer. The filters are extracted in the scintillation<br>
liquid and the radioactivity is measured by liquid<br>
scintigraphy. The specific binding of the [3H]8-OH-DPAT<br>
is defined as the amount of radioactivity retained on<br>
the filters and which may be inhibited by co-incubation<br>
with 10 mM 5-hydroxytryptamine. At a concentration of<br>
1 nM of [3H]8-OH-DPAT, the specific binding represents<br>
90% of the total radioactivity collected on the filter.<br>
For each concentration of test compound, the<br>
percentage of inhibition of the binding with [3H] 8-OH-<br>
DPAT is determined, and then the IC50 concentration, the<br>
concentration which inhibits the binding by 50%.<br>
For the compounds of the invention, the IC5O<br>
values are between 0.1 and 500 nM.<br>
Study of the affinity for the 5-HT2-type serotonineraic<br>
receptors<br>
The compounds of the invention also underwent<br>
an in vitro study of displacement of the binding of<br>
spiperone on the serotoninergic (5-HT2) receptors of rat<br>
cerebral cortex.<br>
For this test, the rat brains are removed,<br>
the cortex is dissected therefrom and is homogenized at<br>
0°C in 10 volumes of a mixture containing, per litre,<br>
50 millimol of Tris/HCl buffer at pH = 7.4,<br>
120 millimol of sodium chloride and 5 millimol of<br>
potassium chloride. The homogeneous mixture is<br>
centrifuged at 4 0,000 x 9 for 10 min, after whxch the<br>
pellet is recovered and is washed by suspending it in<br>
the same buffer mixture, it is homogenized: again and is<br>
centrifuged, this treatment of the pellet being carried<br>
out twice. Lastly, the final pellet is diluted in the<br>
same buffer mixture, in a proportion of 100 mg of wet<br>
tissue per 1 ml of buffer.<br>
The tissue is then preincubated for 10 min at<br>
37oC in the presence of 10 micromol/l of pargyline,<br>
followed by incubation for 20 min at 37°C in the<br>
presence of [3H] spiperone (specific activity: 15 to 36<br>
Ci per millimole) at a concentration of 0.3 nanomol/1<br>
and of the test compound.<br>
The membranes are then collected by<br>
filtration on Whatman GF/B™ filters which are washed<br>
twice with 5 ml of cold buffer. The radioactivity<br>
retained on the filter is measured by liquid<br>
scintigraphy.<br>
In order to evaluate the activity of the<br>
compounds, the curve of the percentage inhibition of<br>
the specific binding of [3H]spiperone is established as<br>
a function of the concentration of displacing drug. The<br>
IC50 concentration, the concentration which inhibits the<br>
specific binding by 50%, is determined graphically.<br>
The specific binding is defined as being the<br>
binding displaced by 100 micromol/1 of 5-HT.<br>
The IC50 concentrations of the compounds of<br>
the invention are between 0.02 and 5 mM.<br>
The results of the tests show that the<br>
compounds of the invention have strong affinity for<br>
D2-type and D3-type dopaminergic receptors and for<br>
5-HT1A-type and 5-HT1-type serotoninergic receptrs.<br>
These results suggest that the compounds can be used<br>
for the treatment of complaints and pathologies<br>
associated with dopaminergic and serotoninergic<br>
transmission dysfunction, in particular of the D2 and D3<br>
dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2<br>
serotoninergic receptors.<br>
Thus, they can be used for the treatment or<br>
psychoses, in particular schizophrenia (deficient form<br>
and productive form) and acute or chronic<br>
extrapyramidal symptoms induced by neuroleptic agents,<br>
for the treatment of various forms of anxietv. panic<br>
attacks, phobias, compulsive obsessional disorders, for<br>
the treatment of various forms of depression, including<br>
psychotic depression, for the treatment of disorders<br>
due to alcohol abuse or withdrawal, sexual behaviour<br>
disorders, eating disorders and for the treatment of<br>
miqraine.<br>
To this end, they may be in any farm<br>
appropriate for administering them orally or<br>
parenterally, combined with any suitable excipient, and<br>
may be dosed to allow a daily dosage of from 1 to<br>
1000 mg.<br>
