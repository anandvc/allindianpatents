FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a water soluble cyclodextrin derivative comprising a mixture of sulfoalkyl ether and alkyl ether substituents on the same cyclodextrin. The invention also provides methods for its preparation and use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclodextrins have been used widely in many different types of cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical formulations. Cyclodextrins are cyclic carbohydrates derived from starch. The unmodified (parent) cyclodextrins differ by the number of glucopyranose units joined together in the cylindrical structure. The parent cyclodextrins contain 6, 7, or 8 glucopyranose units and are referred to as α-, ß-, and γ-cyclodextrin, respectively. The underivatized α-cyclodextrin and ß-cyclodextrin are me most widely used cyclodextrins. Each cyclodextrin subunit has secondary hydroxyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions and a primary hydroxyl group at the 6-position. The cyclocdextrins may be pictured as hollow truncated cones with hydrophilic exterior surfaces and hydrophobic interior cavities. In aqueous solutions, these hydrophobic cavities provide a haven for hydrophobic organic compounds that can fit all or part of their structure into these cavities. This process, known as inclusion complexation, may result in increased apparent aqueous solubility and stability for the complexed compound. The complex is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and does not involve the formation of any covalent bonds.<br>
This dynamic and reversible equilibrium process can be described by Equations 1 and 2, where the amount in the complexed form is a function of the concentrations of the drug and cyclodextrin, and the equilibrium or binding constant, Kb. When cyclodextrin formulations are administered by injection into the blood stream, the complex rapidly dissociates due to the effects of dilution and non-specific binding of the drug to blood and tissue components.<br>
Drug + Cyclodextrin   &gt; Complex	Equation 1<br><br>
[DrugJ[CyclodextrinJ	EquatlOn 2<br>
Binding constants of cyclodextrin and an active agent can be determined by the equilibrium solubility technique as well as other suitable techniques (T. Higuchi et al. in "Advances in Analytical Chemistry and Instrumentation Vol. 4"; C.N. Reilly ed.; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1965, pp. 117-212). Generally, the higher the concentration of cyclodextrin, the more the equilibrium process of Equations 1 and 2 is shifted to the formation of more complex, meaning that the concentration of free active agent is generally decreased by increasing the concentration of cyclodextrin in solution.<br>
a-CD and P-CD are known to be unsafe due to severe nephrotoxicity attributed to their damaging of renal epithelial cells. The mechanism of this renal toxicity is not fully understood. The parent CDs also cause red blood cells hemolysis and membrane irritation that appear to be correlated to their capacity to extract lipid membrane components. A good correlation between the ability of CDs to cause red blood cell hemolysys and their renal toxicity has been noted.<br>
Hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polymerized, ionized, non-ionized and many other modifications of cyclodextrins have been developed, and their use in various industries has been established. Chemical modification of the parent cyclodextrins at one or more of the hydroxyl groups has resulted in derivatives with improved properties. Of the numerous derivatized cyclodextrins prepared to date, only two appear to be commercially viable for pharmaceutical usage: the 2-hydroxypropyl derivatives (HP-CD; neutral cyclodextrins being commercially developed by Janssen and others), and the sulfoalkyl ether derivatives (SAE-CD's, such as sulfobutyl ether, (SBE-CD; anionic cyclodextrins being developed by CyDex, Inc.) However, the HP-P-CD still possesses safety issues that the SBE-CD does not.<br>
A number of references disclose water soluble sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrins and methods for their preparation and use. An SAE-CD can be made according to the disclosures of Stella et al., Parmerter et al., Lammers et al. or Qu et al. (See citations below).<br>
A sulfobutyl ether derivative of beta cyclodextrin (SBE-P-CD), in particular the derivative with an average of about 7 substituents per cyclodextrin molecule, has been<br><br>
commercialized by CyDex, Inc. as CAPTISOL®. The anionic sulfobutyl ether substituent dramatically improves the aqueous solubility and safety of the parent cyclodextrin. Reversible, non-covalent, complexation of drugs with CAPTISOL® cyclodextrin generally allows for increased solubility and, in some cases, increased stability of drugs in aqueous solutions.

Sulfobutyl Ether-p-Cyclodextrin (Captisol®)<br><br>
Sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrins (SAE-CD's), however, are known to have limitations concerning the molecules they can bind with. For example, SAE-CD's but especially Captisol® are known to bind compounds such as nifedipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine and clotrimazole poorly.<br>

U.S. Patents No. 5,760,015 (June 2, 1998) and No. 5,846,954 to Joullie et al. disclose "one-sided" water soluble cyclodextrin derivatives having at least 10 anionic groups on one side of the CD molecule. The majority of the anionic substituents are located at the C-2 and C-3 positions of the carbohydrate rings of the cyclodextrin. The anionic substituent is the anion of "any strong acid, non-limiting examples of these anions include sulfate, nitrate, sulfonate, and phosphate. Sulfate is preferred." Several anionic substituents are listed; however, only the sulfate anion is exemplified. The derivative also includes a hydrophobic substituent located at least at the C-6 position of the carbohydrate. None of these patents includes enablement of a polymeric or non-polymeric S AE-AE-CD derivative.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,019,562 to Folkman et al. discloses anionic CD derivatives having a sulfate, phosphate, or carboxylate group. U.S. Patent No. 5,183,809 to Weisz et al. discloses polyionic derivatives having a sulfate, phosphate, carboxylate or nitrate group. None of these patents includes enablement of a polymeric or non-polymeric S AE-AE-CD derivative.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,658,894 to Weisz et al. suggest polymeric CD derivatives, wherein the CD comprises anionic R groups selected from the group consisting of sulfate, phosphate, sulfonate, carboxylate and nitrate, and nonanionic R groups selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aryl, ester, ether, thioester, thioether. This patent includes no enablement of a polymeric or non-polymeric S AE-AE-CD derivative.<br>
Alkyl ether derivatized cyclodextrins (AE-CD's) are known. They have been described in various patent literature and their synthesis and properties have been well documented in various reviews and books (see Fromming and Szejtli, Cyclodextrins in Pharmacy, Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, 1994 and references therein). Methyl ether CDs are presumed to be strong binders by raising the "height" of the CD ring thus providing an additional area for interaction with interacting molecules. However, a<br>
key limitation of these derivatives is their water solubility. In particular, higher alkylated CDs such as ethyl and propyl ether CDs have shown decreasing water solubility with the increasing IDS (total degree of substitution).<br>
As noted above with regard to the SAE-CD's, AE-CD's are also known to have limited utility due to their poor solubility, and lack of safety. For example, AE-CD's are also known to cause a significant amount of red blood cell hemolysis when administered to a subject. Red blood cell hemolysis has been correlated with increased renal toxicity and membrane disruption. AE-CD's, however, can solubilize some compounds better than SAE-CD's can.<br>
To the knowledge of the present inventors, a mixed ether cyclodextrin comprising an alkyl ether functional group and a sulfoalkyl ether functional group on the same cyclodextrin has only been disclosed once. Jiczinszky et al. ("Cyclodextrin: From Basic Research to Market", International Cyclodextrin Symposium, 10th, Ann Arbor, MI, United States, May 21-24, 2000 (2000), 46-52; Wacker Biochem Corp.: Adrian, Mich.) disclose a proposed synthesis of a permethylated 6-O-sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin derivative. In particular, they disclose a 6-0-(4-sulfobutyl)-permethylated-p-cyclodextrin derivative, wherein the derivative contains only a single sulfobutyl moiety. However, in communications with the author, it was confirmed that the proposed synthesis could not be used to prepare the target derivative. This cyclodextrin derivative, therefore, likely possesses properties that are very similar to the permethylated-p-cyclodextrin, and as has been noted herein, alkylated cyclodextrin derivatives are known to cause a significant amount of hemolysis when administered to a subject. Earlier work by Rajewski et al (Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, (1995), 84, 927-932) showed that low degrees of sulfobutylation did not prevent red blood cell hemolysis and that higher degrees of substitution were preferable.<br>
It is known in the art that the method of preparation of a cyclodextrin derivative can have a significant impact upon final structure and associated properties of a product derivative. The synthetic scheme can alter the total degree of substitution (TDS) as well as the regiochemistry of substitution (the substitution pattern). For example, the interaction of an alkylating agent with a CD during alkylation, changing of the pH of the reaction milieu, and/or varying of the molar ratio of alkylating agent to CD during alkylation can affect the TDS and the substitution pattern.<br>
A need remains for an improved SAE-CD as well as an improved AE-CD, since each of those derivatives is known to have limitations. Modern drug discovery processes are identifying larger more complex molecules whose physical and chemical properties, especially solubility and stability are becoming more problematic. Therefore, there is a need for CDs capable of interacting with larger more complex molecules. AE-CDs of both P- and y-CDs can provide this increased area for interaction but suffer from severe safety issues. It would be extremely beneficial to identify a cyclodextrin derivative that is able to provide enhanced properties over a structurally related SAE-CD and over an AE-CD. It would be useful to identify a CD derivative having the beneficial properties of an SAE-CD and an AE-CD but having less of the disadvantages typically associated with those derivatives.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to provide water soluble cyclodextrin derivatives that exhibit improved properties and/or performance over known alkyl ether cyclodextrins and known sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrins. The present derivatives overcome at least some of the disadvantages present in known formulations. The mixed ether cyclodextrin of the invention provides improved properties over the 6-O-(4-sulfobutyl)-permethylated-p-cyclodextrin derivative of Jicsinszky et al. by increasing the degree of substitution of the sulfoalkyl ether moiety and decreasing the degree of substitution of the alkyl ether moiety. Moreover, the mixed ether cyclodextrin of the invention provides improved properties over known SAE-CD's and known AE-CD's. Specifically, SAE-AE-CDs described here provide the ability to interact with larger more complex molecules without sacrificing safety. SAE-AE-CD's of the invention possess a lengthened binding cavity as compared to structurally related SAE-CD's; therefore, the CD derivative of the invention possesses improved binding of some active agents over that observed with a structurally related SAE-CD. The SAE-AE-CD's of the invention possess reduced hemolytic potential toward red blood cells than do AE-CD's. In many cases, the safety of the SAE-AE-CD is comparable to that of a structurally related SAE-CD even though the CD derivative of the invention possesses at least one AE functional group.<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a water soluble sulfoalkyl ether-alkyl ether cyclodextrin derivative (an SAE-AE-CD) comprising one or more alkyl ether (AE) functional groups and one or more sulfoalkyl ether (SAE) functional groups on the same<br>
cyclodextrin moiety. The degree of substitution (DS) for each functional group is varied as desired such that the total number of the two functional groups does not exceed the number of hydroxyl groups available in the underivatized parent cyclodextrin. The SAE-AE-CD can comprise a majority of SAE functional groups and a minority of AE and OH functional groups. Alternatively, the SAE-AE-CD can comprise a majority of AE functional groups and a minority of SAE and OH functional groups.<br>
In another embodiment, the SAE-AE-CD comprises a majority of OH functional groups and a minority of SAE and AE functional groups. Therefore, one or more hydroxyl groups in the parent cyclodextrin can remain underivatized by an SAE or AE functional group. In other words, the total degree of substitution (TDS) by both functional groups can be less than the total number of hydroxyl groups in the parent cyclodextrin. In one embodiment, a majority of the hydroxyl groups of the parent cyclodextrin is derivatized by an SAE or AE group.<br>
The regioisomerism of derivatization by the SAE and AE groups can also be varied as desired such that a majority of the SAE groups present is preferentially located at a primary hydroxyl group or at one or both of the secondary hydroxyl groups of the parent cyclodextrin. Likewise, a majority of the AE groups present can be preferentially located at a primary hydroxyl group or at one or both of the secondary hydroxyl groups of the parent cyclodextrin. In one embodiment, the distribution of SAE or AE groups in the CD ring is 2&gt;6&gt;3, while in other embodiments the distribution is 6&gt;2&gt;3.<br>
The AE moiety and SAE moiety can be independently or dependently selected at each occurrence within an SAE-AE-CD molecule. The structure of the alkyl portion of the AE and SAE functional groups in a single SAE-AE-CD can be the same or different according to the starting materials and method of preparation employed.<br>
Derivatization (alkylation and sulfoalkylation) of a parent cyclodextrin with precursors of the AE and SAE functional groups can be done in two steps reaction with workup after the first derivatization; in two steps reaction without workup after the first derivatization; in one step reaction with simultaneous addition of the 2 alkylating agents. In one embodiment, an AE-CD is prepared or obtained first, and then the AE-CD is derivatized with an SAE precursor to form an SAE-AE-CD. In another embodiment, an SAE-CD is prepared or obtained first, and then the SAE-CD is derivatized with an AE precursor to form an SAE-AE-CD. Alternatively, a parent cyclodextrin is derivatized in the presence of both an SAE precursor and an AE precursor.<br>
The SAE-AE-CD can be present in less than stoichiometric, stoichiometric or greater than stoichiometric amounts with respect to the amount of another material present in the formulation. Other materials that can be included in an SAE-AE-CD-containing composition include, among other things, one or more excipients and/or one or more active agents.<br>
The composition of the invention can include small amounts (
The invention also provides an active composition comprising an SAE-AE-CD composition of the invention and an active agent, e.g. therapeutic agent. In this embodiment, the active composition and SAE-AE-CD composition independently and optionally comprise one or more excipients. In one embodiment, the active agent, or a majority thereof, is complexed with the SAE-AE-CD. In another embodiment, the active agent, or a majority thereof, is not complexed with the SAE-AE-CD.<br>
Specific embodiments of the invention include those wherein: 1) the molar ratio of an active agent to SAE-AE-CD is less than one to about one; 2) the SAE-AE-CD composition comprises a compound of the formula 3 or a mixture thereof; 3) the molar ratio of an active agent to SAE-AE-CD is greater than one; 4) the cyclodextrin core of the SAE-AE-CD is (5-CD or y-CD; 5) the degree of substitution (DS) for the SAE functional group is greater than the DS for the AE functional group; 6) the DS for the AE functional group is greater than the DS for the SAE functional group; 7) more than half of the hydroxyl moieties of an SAE-AE-CD are derivatized; 8) half or less than half of the hydroxyl moieties of an SAE-AE-CD are derivatized; 9) the SAE and AE functional groups comprise a similar alkylene (alkyl) radical; and/or 10) the SAE and AE functional groups comprise different alkylene (alkyl) radicals.<br>
An embodiment of the invention excludes an SBE1.0-Me20-p-CD. Another embodiment excludes a SBEl-Me(3v+5)-CD, wherein v is 6, 7 or 8, when the CD ring size includes 6, 7 or 8 glucopyranose units, respectively. Still another embodiment excludes a permethylated 0-CD comprising a single -SBE moiety.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An SAE-AE-CD of the invention provides unexpected advantages over a structurally related SAE-CD and/or AE-CD. By "structurally related" is meant, for example, that the SAE substituent of the SAE-CD being compared is essentially the same as the SAE substituent of SAE-AE-CD being compared, and likewise, the AE substituent of the AE-CD being compared is essentially the same as the AE substituent of SAE-AE-CD being compared. Exemplary advantages of an SAE-AE-CD over a structurally related SAE-CD may include an improved ability of the SAE-AE-CD to form complexes and thus solubilize and/or stabilize a neutral, cationic or anionic molecule better than can the structurally related SAE-CD. Exemplary advantages of an SAE-AE-CD over a structurally related AE-CD may include an improved ability of the SAE-AE-CD to solubilize and/or stabilize a cationic molecule better than can the structurally related AE-CD and more importantly be less hemolytic to red blood cells thus providing greater safety.<br>

An embodiment of the present invention provides compositions containing a mixture of cyclodextrin derivatives, having the structure set out in formula 3. In a single parent CD molecule, there are 3v + 6 hydroxyl moieties available for derivatization.<br>
The degree of substitution (DS) for a specific moiety (SAE or AE, for example) is a measure of the number of SAE (or AE) substituents attached to an individual CD molecule, in other words, the moles of substituent per mole of CD. Therefore, each substituent has its own DS for an SAE-AE-CD of the invention. The total degree of substitution (TDS) for an SAE-AE-CD is a measure of the total number of SAE and AE substituents present per CD molecule. Therefore, SAE4.0-AE5.0-CD has a TDS (per CD molecule) of 9.0 (4.0 + 5.0), and it has a DS (per CD molecule) of 4.0 for the SAE group and DS of 5.0 for the AE group. The TDS can be as high as 3v + 6 (the maximum number of available hydroxyl groups) or as low as 2 (wherein, on average, a single CD comprises a single SAE moiety and a single AE moiety). For example, a TDS of 10 means that the values of x and y, in an SAEx-AEy-CD, add up to 10, wherein x can range from 1 to 9 and y and range from 9 to 1, respectively.<br>
A composition of the invention comprises a mixture of different SAE-AE-CD molecules. More specifically, an SAEx-AEy-CD composition comprises plural SAE-AE-CD molecules each having a specific degree of substitution for each substituent. As a consequence, the individual DS for SAE and for AE of an SAEx-AEy-CD composition represents an average of the individual DS values of the population of individual molecules in the composition. For example, an SAE5.2-AE6.9-CD composition comprises a mixture of SAEx-AEy-CD molecules, wherein x (the DS for SAE groups) might range from 1 to 10-11 for individual CD molecules and y (the DS for AE groups) might range from 1 to 11-12 for individual CD molecules; however, the population of SAE-AE-CD molecules is such that the average value for x (the average DS for SAE groups) is 5.2 and for y (the average DS for AE groups) is 6.9. For this same composition, the average TDS is 12.1 (obtained from: 5.2 + 6.9).<br>
An SAE-AE-CD composition can contain on average at least one to 
The invention also includes compositions containing cyclodextrin derivatives having a narrow or wide and high or low TDS (and/or DS). These combinations can be optimized as needed to provide cyclodextrin compositions having particular properties.<br><br>
A parent cyclodextrin includes a secondary hydroxyl group on the C-2 and C-3 positions of the glucopyranose residues forming the cyclodextrin and a primary hydroxyl on the C-6 position of the same. Each of these hydroxyl moieties is available for derivatization by an SAE precursor or AE precursor. Depending upon the synthetic methodology employed in making an SAE-AE-CD, the SAE and AE moieties may be distributed randomly or in a somewhat ordered manner among the available hydroxyl positions. One embodiment of the invention includes an SAE-AE-CD molecule wherein a majority of the SAE moieties is located at the C-6 position, and a majority of the AE moieties is located at the C-2 and/or C-3 position. Another embodiment of the invention includes an SAE-AE-CD molecule wherein a majority of the SAE moieties is located at the C-2 and/or C-3 position, and a majority of the AE moieties is located at the C-6 position. Still another embodiment of the invention includes an SAE-AE-CD molecule wherein the SAE and AE moieties are substantially evenly distributed among the C-2, C-3 and C-6 positions. For low DS derivatives, the invention also provides an embodiment wherein a majority of the AE and SAE moieties is located at the C-2 and/or C-3 position, or an embodiment wherein a majority of the AE and SAE moieties is located at the C-6 position.<br>
The SAE and AE moieties can have the same type of alkylene (alkyl) radical or the alkylene radicals can be different. By way of example and without limitation, the SAE moiety can be a sulfobutyl moiety, and the AE moiety can be an ethyl moiety. In a similar manner, the SAE moiety can be a sulfopropyl moiety, and the AE moiety can be a propyl moiety. In one embodiment, the alkylene radical of the SAE group is the same as the alkyl radical of the AE group. In another embodiment, the alkylene radical of the SAE group is different than the alkyl radical of the AE group.<br>
By controlling the relative ratio of SAE moiety to AE moiety in a cyclodextrin, SAE-AE-CD molecules and compositions having different physical properties can be prepared. The hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the SAE-AE-CD can be balanced by preparing derivatives possessing a predetermined degree of substitution for each functional group, by preparing derivatives possessing a predetermined total degree of substitution, and/or by using predetermined AE and SAE precursors having different degrees of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity relative to one another. For example, an SAE-AE-CD composition having a first TDS can possess greater solubilizing power for a<br>
particular compound than does a second SAE-AE-CD composition having a different IDS.<br>
To the extent that the population of SAE-AE-CD molecules in the SAEx-AEy-CD composition each has the same SAE moiety and the same AE moiety, then the invention provides a composition containing a single type of cyclodextrin derivative. That said, it should be understood that the SAE-AE-CD of the invention can also comprise residual or small amounts of parent CD, SAE-CD and/or AE-CD. Where the amount of parent CD, SAE-CD, or AE-CD present in the SAEx-AEy-CD is 
If the SAEx-AEy-CD composition comprises greater than 5% of parent CD, SAE-CD and/or AE-CD, the properties of the SAEx-AEy-CD composition can be modified by independently or interdependently controlling the amount of each CD component in the composition. For example, where the parent CD or the AE-CD are known to be toxic, the SAEx-AEy-CD is processed to minimize their content. If the parent CD or the AE-CD are known to be non-toxic, SAEx-AEy-CDs containing 5 % or more of the parent CD or the AE-CD can be prepared. Limitations other than safety also need to be considered such as solubility of the parent CD or the AE-CD. In one embodiment, the SAEx-AEy-CD comprises between about 5% to less than 50% of the sum total of SAE-CD, AE-CD and parent CD. Individually, the amounts of SAE-CD, AE-CD and parent CD in the SAE-AE-CD can range from 0 to 49.9% provided the sum total of their amounts is less than 50% thus ensuring that the SAE-AE-CD remains the major component.<br>
The SAEx-AEy-CD derivatives of the invention include embodiments wherein the SAEx-AEy-CD comprises a majority of the cyclodextrin molecules present. In other words, the molar or weight percentage of SAEx-AEy-CD is greater than the sum total of SAE-CD, AE-CD and/or parent CD present. In this manner, the SAEx-AEy-CD is present as a major portion of the cyclodextrin molecules present in a cyclodextrin composition.<br>
The term SAE is used to denote a sulfoalkyl (alkylsulfonic acid) ether moiety it being understood that the SAE moiety comprises a cation (T) unless otherwise specified. Accordingly, the terms SAE and SAET may, as appropriate, be used interchangeably herein.<br>
Since SAE-CD and SAE-AE-CD are poly-anionic cyclodextrins, they can be provided in different salt forms. Suitable counterions include cationic organic atoms or<br>
molecules and cationic inorganic atoms or molecules. The SAE-AE-CD can include a single type of counterion or a mixture of different counterions. The properties of the SAE-AE-CD can be modified by changing the identity of the counterion present. For example, a first salt form of an SAE-AE-CD composition can possess greater osmotic potential than a different second salt form of same SAE-AE-CD, or a first salt form may be exhibit improved tabletting properties over a second salt form.<br>
By "complexed" is meant "being part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with", i.e., a complexed therapeutic agent is part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with a cyclodextrin derivative. By "major portion" is meant greater than about 50% by weight or greater than about 50% on a molar basis. Thus, a formulation according to the present invention may contain an active agent of which more than about 50% by weight is complexed with a cyclodextrin. The actual percent of active agent that is complexed will vary according to the complexation equilibrium binding constant characterizing the complexation of a specific cyclodextrin with a specific active agent. The invention also includes embodiments wherein the active agent is not complexed with the cyclodextrin or wherein a minor portion of the active agent is complexed with the derivatized cyclodextrin. It should be noted that an SAE-AE-CD, or any other anionic derivatized cyclodextrin, can form one or more ionic bonds with a positively charged compound. This ionic association can occur regardless of whether the positively charged compound is complexed with the cyclodextrin by inclusion complexation.<br>
SAE-AE-CD possesses greater water solubility than the corresponding parent cyclodextrin from which it is made. Underivatized a-CD has a water solubility of about 14.5% w/v at saturation. Underivatized (3-CD has a water solubility of about 1.85% w/v at saturation. Underivatized y-CD has a water solubility of about 23.2% w/v at saturation although this number has been in question, i.e., practically, clear 23.2% solutions of y-CD cannot be made and maintained clear. The water solubility of the SAE-AE-CD is greater than 50% w/v. For example, all the SAE-AE-CDs prepared here (see examples that follow) have a water solubility of &gt;50% w/v.<br>
An SAE-AE-CD possesses greater water solubility than an AE-CD having the same AE functional group and degree of substitution thereof. For example, dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Me2-p-CD, an AE-CD) forms a 43% w/w aqueous solution at saturation; however, SBE7-Me2-p-CD will have a greater water solubility due to its increased ionic<br><br>
nature. In addition, Me2-p-CD, is very toxic if administered parenterally as well as to mucous surfaces like the nasal cavity and the cornea of the eye. SBE7-Me2-f3-CD is less irritating to mucous surfaces and presumably the kidney based on its lower red blood cell hemolysis.<br>
FIG. 6a depicts a chart of the effect that increasing the concentration of cyclodextrin has on the hemolysis of red blood cells. The chart includes data for y-CD, SBE5.2-Y-CD, SBE5.2-Et8.9-y-CD, Et4.5-y-CD, and SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD. FIG. 6b depicts the results of the same type of hemolysis assays for p-CD, SBE4.6-p-CD; SBE4.6-Et6.5-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et3.5-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et8.5-p-CD and CAPTISOL™. FIG. 6 c depicts the results of hemolysis assays for y-CD, SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD, SBE6.5-P-CD, SBE5.2-Me3.5-y-CD, and SBE5.2-Pr5-y-CD, Et-y-CD, and SBE5.2-y-CD. The results demonstrate that sulfoalkylation of the Et4.5-y-CD results in a safer CD having a lower hemolytic potential. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of reducing the hemolytic potential of an AE-CD, the method comprising the step of sulfoalkylating the AE-CD thereby converting it to an SAE-AE-CD having a reduced hemolytic potential as compared to the AE-CD.<br>

In general, the value of "y" ranges from 1 to 3v + 5. Where v = 4 (cc-CD), "y" can range in value from 1 to 17. Where v = 5 (P-CD), "y" can range in value from 1 to 20. Where v = 6 (y-CD), "y" can range in value from 1 to 23. In general, "y" also ranges in value from 1 to 3v + z, where z ranges in value from 0 to 5. "y" may also range from 1 to 2v + z, or from 1 to Iv + z.<br>

Among other uses, an SAE-AE-CD can be used to solubilize and/or stabilize a wide range of different materials and to prepare formulations for particular applications. The present cyclodextrin derivative may provide enhanced solubility and/or enhanced chemical, thermochemical, hydrolytic and/or photochemical stability of other ingredients in a composition. For example, an SAE-AE-CD may be used to stabilize an active agent in an aqueous medium. An SAE-AE-CD may also be used to increase the solubility of an active agent in an aqueous medium. For example, an increase in the binding constant for a particular active agent is observed upon conversion of an SAE-CD to an SAE-AE-CD.<br>
SAE-AE-CD's according to the invention were evaluated in terms of their ability to bind with different drugs as compared to the binding of the same drugs with structurally related SAE-CD's. FIGS. 7a-7h depict the results of binding studies of SAE-AE-y-CD's with the drugs nifedipine (FIG. 7a), nimodipine (FIG. 7b), nitrendipine (FIG. 7c), triamcinolone (FIG. 7d), a-methyl-prednisolone (FIG. 7e), prednisolone (FIG. 7f), clotrimazole (FIG. 7g), camptothecin (FIG. 7h), and Budesonide (FIG 71). The binding constant of each SAE-AE-CD derivative with each drug was determined. The data are expressed in terms of DS (y) for ethylation (i.e., for SBEx-Ety-y-CD) versus the observed binding constant for the above-mentioned drugs. In a similar fashion, FIGS. 8a-8f depict the results of binding studies of SAE-AE-p-CD's with the drugs nifedipine (FIG. 8a; SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD, where y =0, 3.5, 5.9, 7.9), nimodipine (FIG. 8b; SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD,<br>
where y =0. 3.5, 6.9, 8.9), nitrendipine (FIG. 8c; SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD, where y =0. 3.5, 6.9, 8.9), triamcinolone (FIG. 8d; SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD, where y =0. 3.5, 6.0, 8.9), oc-methyl-prednisolone (FIG. 8e), prednisolone (FIG. 8f; SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD, where y =0. 3.5, 6.0, 7.9) and budesonide (FIG. 8g; SAE5.2-Ety-p-CD, where y =0. 4.9, 6.9, 8.9). In each of the figures, the SAE-AE-CD possesses improved binding (higher binding constant) to the above-mentioned drugs than does the structurally related SBE-CD. This apparently is true regardless of whether or not the cyclodextrin ring in the SAE-AE-CD is P-CD or y-CD. In some embodiments, the high binding constants are observed when the DS (value for "y") for the Et (AE) substituent falls in the range of greater than 0 and less than or equal to about 10, about 1 to about 9, about 1 to about 9, or about 1 to about 8. The methyl and propyl ether derivatives, SAE-Me-CD and SAE-Pr-CD, respectively, may provide increased binding constants at "y" values similar to or different than the SAE-Et-CD.<br>
The invention thus provides an SAEx-AEy-CD derivative having an increased binding constant for an active agent as compared to the binding constant of a structurally related SAE-CD with the same active agent. The invention also provides a method of increasing the binding constant of an S AEx-CD derivative for an active agent, the method comprising the step of derivatizing the SAEx-CD with an AE precursor to form an SAEx-AEy-CD having an increased binding constant for the active agent, wherein the SAEx-AEy-CD is optionally purified to remove unwanted materials.<br>
The ring size of the parent CD and the degree of substitution and the length of the alkyl ether substituent can each have an effect upon the cyclodextrin's ability to solubilize a compound. The effects can be balanced to provide SAE-AE-CD derivatives that solubilize compounds to a great extent. The following table details the observed solubility (mg/ml) for camptothecin in the presence of the indicated cyclodextrins, present at a concentration of about 50 mM in water.<br><br>

It is well known that different CD derivatives possess different affinities with drugs that vary in structure. FIG. 9 depicts a phase solubility diagram for the derivative SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD and the drugs triamcinolone, prednisolone, and D-(-)-norgestrel. This derivative behaves differently with each of the three drugs. The key structural difference between the drugs is the structure of the pendant side-chain at position 17.<br>
FIG. 10 depicts a phase solubility diagram for the drug D-(-)-norgestrel and the following CD's: 1) y-CD; 2) Et5.1-y-CD; 3) SBE5.2-y-CD; 4) SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD; and 5) SBE5.2-Et6.9-y-CD. The binding of y-CD with norgestrel is improved by derivatization with an ethyl moiety and even more by derivatization with a sulfobutyl moiety. However, the combined derivatization, i.e. ethyl and sulfobutyl, provides an unexpectedly greater improvement in binding (see SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD). Increasing the degree of substitution of the ethyl moiety provides even better binding with norgestrel (see SBE5.2-Et-6.9-y-CD).<br>
FIG. 11 depicts a chart showing the relationship between the binding constant for hydrocortisone and SAE-AE-CD and the degree of substitution for the derivatives SAE-AE-y-CD and SAE-AE-p-CD. The SBE-y-CD has a lower binding constant for hydrocortisone than does SBE-p-CD indicating that the former has greater solubilizing power. As the degree of substitution (DS; y) for the ethyl ether substituent (Et) for SBE5.2-Ety-p-CD increases from 0 to 4.9, the binding constant increases significantly. However, further increasing the DS to 6.9 or 8.9 dramatically reduces the binding constant. Aside from the already lower affinity that SBE5.2-y-CD already has for hydrocortisone, increasing the DS for the Et to 4.9, 6.9 or 8.9 also causes an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in the binding constant. The SAE-AE-CD possesses an optimal DS for the Et substituent when binding to hydrocortisone.<br>
FIG. 12 depicts a chart showing the relationship between binding constant for budesonide and SAE-AE-CD and the degree of substitution for the derivatives SAE-AE-y-CD and SAE-AE-P-CD. The SBE-P-CD has a lower binding constant for budesonide than does SBE-y-CD indicating that the former has greater solubilizing power. As the degree of<br>
substitution (DS; y) for the ethyl ether substituent (Et) for SBE4.6-Ety-p-CD increases from 0 to 3.5, the binding constant increases dramatically. However, further increasing the DS to 6.5 or 8.5 dramatically reduces the binding constant. Aside from the already high affinity that SBE5.2-y-CD already has for budesonide, increasing the DS for the Et to 4.9, 6.9 or 8.9 also causes an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in the binding constant. The SAE-AE-CD possesses an optimal DS for the Et substituent when binding to budesonide.<br>
A direct observation of the effect that chain length of the alkyl ether substituent might have on the solubilizing power of a CD is depicted in FIG. 13, which depicts the maximum concentration of a-methyl prednisolone dissolved in the presence of the same concentration (100 mM) of cyclodextrin derivative. For this model drug, increasing the chain length of the alkyl ether substituent increasing the binding affinity (binding constant) of the CD derivative for the drug. For example, for SBE5.2-AE5-y-CD, changing the AE substituent from Me to Et to Pr results in a corresponding increasing in the solubilizing power for a-methyl prednisolone.<br>
FIG. 14 depicts a phase solubility diagram for a-methyl prednisolone and three CD's: CAPTISOL™ (SBE7-P-CD), SBE5.2-y-CD and SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD. The data indicates that the y-CD ring binds more favorably with the drug than does the p-CD ring; however, conversion of the SBE5.2-y-CD to SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD results in even better binding with the drug.<br>
The binding of paclitaxel (TAXOL®) with HP-p-CD, SBE4-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et6-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et8.5-p-CD, CAPTISOL®, SBE5.2-y-CD, SBE5.2-Me3.2-y-CD, SBE5.2-Et3.5-y-CD, SBE45.2-Et4.9-y-CD and SBE5.2-Et8.9-y-CD was evaluated as follows. Stock solutions containing CD (10 mM or 50 mM, water, pH 4.5) were prepared and divided into portions. Excess amount of drug was added to the CD solutions that were then vortexed, sonicated for 5 minutes and equilibrated at 25°C for 24 hours, after which equilibrium was reached. The solutions were centrifuged, and the concentration of drug in each supernatant was measured by HPLC after 1 and 5 days. The stability of paclitaxel in the presence of cyclodextrins, stored at 4°C after 5 days of preparation was measured. The concentration of paclitaxel for solubility experiments was calculated based on a calibration curve obtained using an HPLC method interfaced with UV/Vis detector. The data is summarized in the table below.<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Of the cyclodextrins tested, SBE5.2-Et8.9-Y-CD was found to be the best at solubilizing paclitaxel. Accordingly, the solubility of paclitaxel in the presence of SBE5.2-Et8.9-Y-CD was determined.<br>
The phase solubility diagram is detailed in FIG. 15. Similar analyses were conducted with docetaxel (TAXOTERE®) and SBE5.2-Et8.9-Y-CD and SBE5.2-Et4.9-Y-CD. The data taken at 25 °C after vortexing, sonication and equilibration for 24 hours are summarized in the table below.<br><br>

It is evident that the simultaneous presence of an AE and SAE chain on the same CD ring improves the binding potential of the parent CD or of an AE-CD and SAE CD.<br>
The binding potential of all tested molecules varied with the DS (y) of the CD derivatives. The variability is not present only in molecules with different structure but also in molecules with similar structure, e.g. nimodipine, nitrendipine and nifedipine.<br>

An active agent contained within the present formulation can be present as its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the active agent is modified by reacting it with an acid or base as needed to form an ionically bound pair. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Suitable non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfonic, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and others known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent active agent which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Lists of other suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th. ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The SAE-AE-CD need not bind with another material, such as an active agent, present in a formulation containing it. However, if an SAE-AE-CD binds with another material, such a bond can be formed as a result of inclusion complexation, ion pair formation, hydrogen bonding, and/or Van der Waals bonding.<br>
An anionic derivatized cyclodextrin can complex or otherwise bind with an acid-ionizable agent. As used herein, the term acid-ionizable agent is taken to mean any compound that becomes or is ionized in the presence of an acid. An acid-ionizable agent comprises at least one acid-ionizable functional group that becomes ionized when exposed to acid or when placed in an acidic medium. Exemplary acid-ionizable functional groups include a primary amine, secondary amine, tertiary amine, quaternary amine, aromatic amine, unsaturated amine, primary thiol, secondary thiol, sulfonium, hydroxyl, enol and others known to those of ordinary skill in the chemical arts.<br>
The degree to which an acid-ionizable agent is bound by non-covalent ionic binding versus inclusion complexation formation can be determined spectrometrically using methods such as 1HNMR, 13CNMR, or circular dichroism, for example, and by analysis of the phase solubility data for the acid-ionizable agent and anionic derivatized cyclodextrin. The artisan of ordinary skill in the art will be able to use these conventional methods to approximate the amount of each type of binding that is occurring in solution to determine whether or not binding between the species is occurring predominantly by non-covalent ionic binding or inclusion complex formation. Under conditions where non-covalent ionic bonding predominates over inclusion complex formation, the amount of inclusion complex formation, measured by NMR or circular dichroism, will be reduced even though the phase solubility data indicates significant binding between the species under those conditions; moreover, the intrinsic solubility of the acid-ionizable agent, as determined from the phase solubility data, will generally be higher than expected under those conditions.<br>
As used herein, the term non-covalent ionic bond refers to a bond formed between an anionic species and a cationic species. The bond is non-covalent such that the two species together form a salt or ion pair. An anionic derivatized cyclodextrin provides the anionic species of the ion pair and the acid-ionizable agent provides the cationic species of the ion pair. Since an anionic derivatized cyclodextrin is multi-valent, an SAE-AE-CD can form an ion pair with one or more acid-ionizable or otherwise cationic agents.<br>
A liquid formulation of the invention may be converted to a solid formulation for reconstitution. A reconstitutable solid composition according to the invention comprises an active agent, a derivatized cyclodextrin and optionally at least one other pharmaceutical excipient. This composition is reconstituted with an aqueous liquid to form a liquid formulation that is preserved. The composition can comprise an admixture (minimal to no presence of an inclusion complex) of a solid derivatized cyclodextrin and an active agent-containing solid and optionally at least one solid pharmaceutical excipient, such that a major portion of the active agent is not complexed with the derivatized cyclodextrin prior to reconstitution. Alternatively, the composition can comprise a solid mixture of a derivatized cyclodextrin and an active agent, wherein a major portion of the active agent is complexed with the derivatized cyclodextrin prior to reconstitution. The reconstitutable solid can also comprise a derivatized cyclodextrin and an active agent where substantially<br>
all or at least a major portion of the active agent is complexed with the derivatized cyclodextrin.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
An exemplary SAEx-AEy-CD according to the invention can be made using the following general procedure, wherein an SAE-CD in an alkaline aqueous medium is derivatized with an AE precursor to form the SAEx-AEy-CD.<br>
S AEx-CD is placed in an aqueous medium in the presence of an alkaline material present in an amount sufficient to render the resulting mixture alkaline and deprotonate at least one of the hydroxyl substituents of the cyclodextrin ring. An AE precursor is added to the mixture in a molar amount sufficient to etherify the SAEx-CD to form the SAEx-AEy-CD having the desired DS for AE. The alkaline material may be added before during or after exposure of the SAEx-CD to the AE precursor. The ratio of y:x may be determined by control of the molar ratio of AE precursor to SAEx-CD before or during the<br>
reaction period, or it can be determined after completion of the reaction or after completion of purification of the SAEx-AEy-CD by other methods described herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
An exemplary SAEx-AEy-CD according to the invention can be made using the following alternate general procedure, wherein an AE-CD in an alkaline aqueous medium is derivatized with an SAE precursor to form the SAEx-AEy-CD.<br>
AEy-CD is placed in an aqueous medium in the presence of an alkaline material present in an amount sufficient to render the resulting mixture alkaline and deprotonate at least one of the hydroxyl substituents of the cyclodextrin ring. An SAE precursor is added to the mixture in a molar amount sufficient to etherify the AEy-CD to form the SAEx-AEy-CD having the desired DS for SAE. The alkaline material may be added before during or after exposure of the AEy-CD to the SAE precursor. The ratio of y:x might be determined by control of the molar ratio of SAE precursor to AEy-CD before or during the reaction period, or it can be determined after completion of the reaction or after completion of purification of the SAEx-AEy-CD by other methods described herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
An exemplary SAEx-AEy-CD according to the invention can be made using the following alternate general procedure, wherein an underivatized parent CD in an alkaline aqueous medium is derivatized with an SAE precursor and an AE precursor to form the SAEx-AEy-CD.<br>
Parent cyclodextrin (CDz, wherein "z" indicated the number of moles) is placed in an aqueous medium in the presence of an alkaline material present in an amount sufficient to render the resulting mixture alkaline and deprotonate at least one of the hydroxyl substituents of the cyclodextrin ring. An SAE precursor, an AE precursor or a mixture thereof is added to the parent cyclodextrin in a molar amount sufficient to etherify the parent CD to form the SAE-CD, AE-CD or SAEx-AEy-CD, respectively. The alkaline material may be added before during or after exposure of the parent CD to the precursors.

EXAMPLE 4<br>
The following procedure was used to analyze the SAE-AE-CD by capillary electrophoresis.<br>
A Beckman P/ACE 2210 capillary electrophoresis system coupled with a UV absorbance detector (Beckman instruments, Inc., Fullereton, CA) was used to analyze a 5mM solution of each SBE-p and SBE-y CD derivative. The separation was performed at 25°C using a fused silica capillary (50um inner diameters total length of 57cm and effective length of 50cm) with a pH 7.0 running buffer 23mM benzoic acid and 25mm TRIS (tris-hydroxymethyl-aminomethano).<br>
The capillary was treated with the following wash sequence before each injection with 7 volume exchanges (VEs) of water, 5 VEs 0.0 IN NaOH, 3VEs water, 5VEs running buffer. The detector was set at 230nm. The current was 25-30uA. Samples were introduced by pressure injections: Is at 5psi.<br>
FIGS. 2-3 depict electropherograms obtained for the analysis of SBE5.2-y-CD (FIG. 2) and SBE5.2-Et4.9-y-CD (FIG. 3). The electropherogram indicate the peaks corresponding to the various isomers. For example, FIG. 2 depicts nine numbered peaks, wherein each peak corresponds to an SBE-y-CD having the degree of substitution indicated by the number at the apex of the peak. Accordingly, the SBE5.2-y-CD starting material actually comprises about nine different species, i.e. SBEi-9-y-CD. The average TDS, however, for the SBE groups is 5.2 as determined by averaging peak areas.<br>
FIG. 3 also depicts nine numbered peaks, since it is an electropherogram of the ethyl ether derivative derived from SBE5.2-y-CD. The TDS for the ethyl ether substituent was determined with NMR by integration of the peaks of the spectra described below.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The following procedure was used to evaluate the moisture content the cyclodextrin derivatives.<br>
Determinations were performed in triplicate on 5-10 mg of each using a Brinkman 652 Karl-Fischer Coulometer (Brinkman Instruments Co., IL). A known weight of solid CD is added to the Karl-Fischer Coulometer and the total amount of water in the sample is read-out. This is then converted to a percentage of the solid thus giving the percent moisture content of the sample.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The identity of the cyclodextrin derivatives was determined by 'HNMR, 13CNMR, COSY NMR and HMQC on a Bruker Avance 400 or 500 instrument in D2O solutions.<br>
FIG. 1 depicts the HMQC spectrum of SBE4.6-Et6.0-p-CD. The peak assignments corresponding to the indicated carbon atoms of the glucopyranose carbons are indicated in the figure. The HMQC spectrum of compounds that have SBE sidechains, ethyl sidechains, and both, exhibit a consistent pattern of chemical shift changes resulting from substituents. The effects of SBE substitution and ethyl substitution are very similar, because in each case, an ether linkage is formed to a sugar carbon in which there is a -CHi group on the other side of the ether oxygen, and another carbon connected to that. The directly substituted sugar carbon shifts downfield about 8 ppm, while the proton attached to that carbon shifts upfield by ~0.2 ppm. The sugar carbon next to the site of substitution shifts upfield by 2-3 ppm, while the proton attached to that carbon shifts downfield by about 0.2 ppm. The effects of substitution at 2 are clearly seen on the C-l and H-l signal. The effects of substitution at 6 are also easy to see in the carbon spectrum, because C-6 is more than 10 ppm upfield of the other sugar carbons. The effect of a substitution at 3 is somewhat more difficult to observe. Substitution at C-2 or C-3 shifts that carbon signal out near the shift of C-4; however, substitution at C-3 shifts the C-4 signal upfield as well as shifting C-3 downfield.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts the 13CNMR spectrum of SBE4.6-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et6.0-p-CD, SBE4.6-Et9-p-CD, and Et-p-CD compositions.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts an expanded 13CNMR spectrum of the C2, C3 and C6 carbon atoms of an SAE-AE-CD of the invention, in particular SBE4.6-Et6.0-p-CD. The peak amplitude was used to determine the degree of substitution. The ID spectra is analyzed for quantitation (determination of DS). First, the inter-pulse delay is made greater than 5*T1, since the sugar carbons have short Tl's. The side-chain carbons, which have internal mobility in addition to the overall molecular mobility, however, show much larger NOE's,<br>
and at the same time, have much longer Tl 's. The NOE's have a much larger effect on the observed signal intensity. This means that one cannot easily integrate carbon spectra taken with the usual parameters to determine the number of ethyl or SHE groups; those carbons will have disproportionately large signals relative to the sugar carbons. But the situation is better for integrating the unsubstiruted 6 carbons against the substituted 6 carbons or one kind of ethyl CHS against another. In this case the Tl's and NOE's are very similar. So it is straightforward to determine the amount of substitution at 6 from the 6 signal, and the amount at 2 from the 1 signal. Additionally we know the total degree of substitution from the 1H spectrum, so the level of substitution at 3 is determined by difference of the product as compared to the starting material. It is apparent from the 13C spectrum of the SEE that the 2-position is extensively substituted while the 6-position reacts much less. The order of substitution appears to be 2&gt;3&gt;6. However, in the random ethyl, the 6-position is derivatized to a greater extent than the 2-position. Also, the ethyl CH3 carbon signal is split into 3 signals. It is reasonable to assume that these correspond to an ethyl substitution at 2, 3, or 6, so we can measure the level of ethyl substitution directly from these carbon signals. In this case the order of substitution is 6&gt;2&gt;3.<br>
It should be noted that there may be a slight difference in the DS or TDS reported for a specific cyclodextrin composition when using different methods of determination. Unless otherwise specified, the DS or TDS of a material is an accurate estimation of the experimentally determined value.<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
The following procedure was used to evaluate the hemolytic potential of an SAE-AE-CD of the invention.<br>
Erythrocytes were separated from freshly drawn citrated rabbit blood and separated<br>
by centrifugation (Dynac     centrifuge, Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ.) at lOOOxg for 10 minutes. After that time the plasma was removed and the red blood cells were washed<br><br>
three times with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and resuspended in the buffered solution to give a hematocrit of 5%. The red blood cells suspension (O.lml) was added to different concentration of 2ml CD buffer solutions (range of concentration: 0.01 to 0.1 M). After 30 minutes of incubation at 37 °C the release of hemoglobin was measured spectrophotometrically at 543 nm. (Perkin Elmer double beam UV/Vis Lamda 6 instrument). The degree of hemolysis was reported as a percentage of total release heme. The 100% released heme was obtained by substitution of the CD solution with 2mL distilled water.<br>
