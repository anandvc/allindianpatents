				<td>A process for isolation of extract containing bioactive fractions from plant Woodfordia fruticosa<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of the extract of Woodfordia fruticosa for treatment of ulcer and related diseases.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Traditional herbal preparations are known for centuries to protect against peptic ulcer diseases, the aetiopathological basis of which were not known in those periods Current day knowledge about the underlying biochemical mechanism for most of the gastric ulcers and majority of the duodenal ulcers deserve appropriate consideration and due weightage while consolidating the claim regarding the efficacy of a plant extract.<br>
In a Program on "Discovery, Development &amp; Commercialization of New Bioactive &amp; Traditional Preparations', coordinated by Council of Scientific Research, the Applicant has been collecting, extracting and screening different potential plants and then parts for their bioefficacy against various diseases. Gastric ulcer is one such disease. Based on screening through appropriate experimental model(s), the applicant has selected a plant flower as our target for the development of an effective anti ulcer medicine. This invention envisages to claim the potential of an extract obtained from the flower of Woodfordia fruticosa to act as an effective therapy against peptic ulcer diseases.<br>
Reported        Medicinal       Use:<br>
The plant Woodfordia fruticosa Kurz. Syn. W. floribunda Salisb popular!) known in regional languages as "Dhatki" is a much branched shrub with fluted stems and long, spreading branches, grows to a maximum height of 7 m, and occurs througlunii North India, ascending to an altitude of about 1,500 m in the Himalayas [Chadha. Y. R. (ed.), The Wealth of India, Raw Materials, Vol. X (1976), Council of Scicntilic &amp; Industrial Research, New Delhi, pp 586-687]. It is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its flowers.<br>
 of this plant are reported to be used for the treatment of<br>
haemorrhoids, dysentery, and liver diseases [[Chadha, Y. R. (ed.), The Wealth of India,<br>
Raw Materials, Vol. X (1976), Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, New Delhi,<br>
pp 586-687; Dhar, M. L., Dhar, M. M., Dhawan, B. N., Mehrotra, B. N. and Ray, C., Ind.<br>
J. exp. Biol. 6, 232 (1968); Kirtikar, K. R. and Basu, B.D., Indian Medicinal Plants (Eds.<br>
Blatter, E., Caius, J. F. and Mhaskar, K. S.), Vol. II, Publishers: Lalit Mohan Basu,<br>
Allahabad, India (1935), p. 1074],<br>
The dried flowers are also credited with stimulant and astringent properties. They<br>
are often added to the Ayurvedic Arishtas to cause alcoholic fermentation. Powered dried<br>
flowers when sprinkled over ulcers and wounds, diminishes discharge and promotes<br>
granulation. A paste of the flower is reported to be used for the treatment of coughs. An<br>
ointment containing this flower was also used in the pustules of smallpox. An extract of<br>
the flowers shows activity against Helminthosporium sativum [Chadha, Y. R. (ed.), The<br>
Wealth of India, Raw Materials, Vol. X (1976), Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial<br>
Research, New Delhi, pp 586-687; Kirtikar, K. R. and Basu, B.D., Indian Medicinal<br>
Plants (Eds. Blatter, E., Caius, J. F. and Mhaskar, K. S.), Vol. II, Publishers: Lalit Mohan<br>
Basu, Allahabad, India (1935), p. 1074]. The flowers are reported to be gathered and<br>
sucked by children for sweet nectar. They are believed to be eaten, in Madhya Pradesh,<br>
and in West Bengal are employed for making a cooling drink [Bhargava, J. Bombay nat.<br>
Hist. Soc., 56, 26 (1959); Desai et al. Indian J, Chem. 9, 611 (1971)].<br>
Strategy &amp; Approach Plan<br>
The concept of management of peptic ulcer diseases is fast changing.<br>
Traditionally, treatment was based on the principle that excessive secretion of acid was<br>
the sole cause of ulcer symptoms. Later on, a proposed role of psychological stress also<br>
gained wide acceptance. Ulcer formation is currently viewed as an interactive process<br>
that results from an imbalance of 'aggressive factors' like acid, pepsin, smoking, alcohol,<br>
pain killer etc. and 'defensive factors' like mucin, bicarbonate, milk etc. [Hirschowitz, B.<br>
L, Keeling, D., Lewin, M., Okabe, S., Parsons, M., Sewing, K. Wallmark, B. and Sachs,<br>
G., Dig. Dis. Sci., 40, 3S (1995)].<br>
It was established in the first quarter of the last century that gastric acid is<br>
secreted by a class of gastric cells called parietal cells while the physiological basis of<br>
obligatory requirements of K4 and Ca2+ in gastric HC1 secretion and regulation came into<br>
our knowledge-base in the middle of twentieth century [Modlin, I. M., Surg. Gyneol.<br>
Obstet., 170, 81 (1990).<br>
The role of histamine, gastrin and acetylcholine in controlling gastric acid<br>
secretion was understood only around the third quarter of last century and this triggered<br>
the designing of chemical molecules acting as blockers of such receptors giving rise to<br>
functionally effective anti-ulcer drugs [Prinz. C, Kajimura, M., Scott, D., Helander, H.,<br>
Shin, J., Besancon, M., Bamberg, K., Hersey, S. and Sachs, G., Yale J. Biol. Med. 65, 577<br>
(1992)].<br>
That an enzyme known as 'Gastric Proton Pump' is the final common mediator of<br>
HC1 transport in the stomach lumen was accepted only in 1980s, paving the way for the<br>
advent of omeprazole era [Sachs, G., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 28, 269 (1998).<br>
Finally around 1990s, a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori was shown to be<br>
responsible for peptic ulcer and perhaps gastric carcinoma [Adrian Lee and Francis<br>
Megraud (eds) Helicobacter pylori: techniques for clinical diagnosis &amp; basic research,<br>
W.B. Saunders Company Ltd. 1996].<br>
All these discoveries are being given appropriate consideration in delineating the<br>
claim about the efficacy of this single herbal extract. The applicant anticipates bringing in<br>
a new generation of herbal medicine in the horizon. Since sufficient tools and knowledge<br>
are available today to come very close to identifying the site of action of any unknown<br>
principle(s) with a specific mechanism, and since it is imperative that the specific site of<br>
action of a new drug be shown before it can be accepted, the applicant has carefully<br>
selected four experimental models so as to cover majority of the aetiological factors<br>
responsible for the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer diseases.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
treating peptic ulcer and related ulcerical conditions.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition<br>

Example 1: Collection, Extraction and Fractionation<br>
The present invention consists of collection of the flowers during the month of<br>
February and March of the year, drying in shade, extracting the powdered flowers with a<br>
mixture of water or alcohol in the ratio of 1:1, concentrating the extract under reduced<br>
pressure at 30°C and finally freeze-drying to a powder (A-002). Further partition of the<br>
extract with «-butanol and water furnished two fractions, the w-butanol soluble fraction<br>
and the aqueous part. Both the fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure and<br>
finally freeze-dried to give the «-butanol soluble fraction (F-006) and aqueous fraction<br>
(F-007). All the three fractions (A-002, F-006 and F-007) were bioevaluated in different<br>
experimental models for peptic ulcer disease.<br>
Figure 1 shows the fraction extracted and its testing in animal models.<br>
ICB-XXX-PXX-A002<br>
; 4,<br>
F-007 F-006<br>
A typical fractionation gave the following result. Air-dried powdered flowers of<br>
Woodfordia fruticosa (100 g) were extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (250<br>
ml) in the ratio of 1:1 for 18 h. The extraction was repeated twice. The extracts were<br>
mixed and concentrated under reduced pressure at 30°C and finally freeze dried to give a<br>
dark-brown powder (20 g) [A-002]. The powdered material is macerated with water (125<br>
ml) and extracted with n-butanol (3 x 100 ml). The n-butanol extracts are mixed together,<br>
washed with water (100 ml), concentrated under reduced pressure and finally freeze-dried<br>
to furnish a powder (4 g) [F-006]. In a similar manner the aqueous part is concentrated<br>
and freeze dried to give a powdered material (16 g) [F 007].<br>
Example 2: Bioevaluation - Protocols &amp; Results<br>
The applicant have selected one whole animal model - Cold Restraint Stress Ulcer in Rat<br>
(in vivo) to assess ulcer protection capacity of the extracts [Senay E.G. and Levine R.J.,<br>
Proc Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 124, 1221 (1967)], one isolated stomach model - Chambered<br>
Frog Gastric Mucosa (in organ) to assess anti HC1 secretion potential [Durbin R.P. and<br>
Kircher A.B., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 321, 553 (1973); Ray, T.K. and Tague L.R.,<br>
Biochem. Pharmacol. 29, 2755 (1980); Ray et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 79, 1448<br>
(1982)], gastric proton pump inhibition model using pig gastric H+,K+-ATPase-rich<br>
apical and tubulovesicular membranes (in vitro) to examine enzyme inhibition<br>
[Bandopadhyay, S. Das, P. K., Wright, M. V., Nandi, J., Bhattacharyya, D. and Ray, T.<br>
K., J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5664 (1987)], and anti Helicobacter pylori activity assessment by<br>
Disc Diffusion Sensitivity Assay [Glupczynski, Y. In: Helicobacter pylori: techniques for<br>
clinical diagnosis &amp; basic research, (Eds. Adrian Lee &amp; Francis Megraud), W.B.<br>
Saunders Company Ltd., 1996, pp. 17-32].<br>
1. Cold Restraint Stress Ulcer - In vivo Model: This in vivo rat model was used to<br>
evaluate stress induced ulcer formation (stress generated by cold as well as restraint) and<br>
the effect of pretreatment of the animals with different extracts was examined. Rats,<br>
weighing about 200-250 g (either sex), were fasted overnight with ad libitum access to<br>
water. About 20-25 mg extracts per kg body weight (suspended in 1:1 methanol-water<br>
and sonicated for proper dispersion of insoluble samples) was injected, /. p., prior to<br>
stress induction for about 3'/2-4 h at 4-6°C. About 6-8 rats per batch (control rats received<br>
equal volume of vehicle, ~ 0.2 ml) were used and the data represent average of 4-6<br>
different experiments.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
No mortality, either before or during or after stress was noted. The mother extract<br>
A-002 appears to be very promising as antiulcer extract. Further, the fraction F-006<br>
appears to be the most potent among the three extracts. The low activity in fraction F-007<br>
indicates that perhaps majority of the active principle is being concentrated in F-006<br>
fraction. The observation was confirmed and reconfirmed with fresh extracts in all three<br>
above fractions.<br>
2. Frog Chamber Study : The in organ experiments using the whole frog stomach<br>
to assess the anti-HCl secreting potential of extracts and their fractions were carried out<br>
employing Frog Chamber Model (for detail about the logic of the experiment and the<br>
information to be generated,<br>
1. Frog Chamber Study : The study is based on the principle of 'No Acid No<br>
Ulcer'. Since peptic ulcer is invariably accompanied by hyper-secretion of gastric HC1, a<br>
study using frog gastric mucosa (Rana hexadactyla, available species in West Bengal) as<br>
the experimental system was used to generate information about the anti-HCl secreting<br>
potential of the extracts vis-a-vis known drugs (omeprazole and/or cimetidine) against<br>
histamine stimulated acid secretion. In this_m vitro study, frog stomach is mounted in a<br>
plastic tube (Using Chamber Study). Employing histamine as the ulcerogen (final<br>
common mediator of all the physiological secretagogues), the rate and extent of proton<br>
secretion are quantitatively assessed as a function of the amount of herbal preparation and<br>
duration of treatment.<br>
The experimental approach, as standardized through a series of experiments with<br>
more than 200 plant extracts, has been to measure, over time, (i) basal acid secretion, (ii)<br>
histamine-stimulated acid secretion, (iii) extract-induced (two doses) acid secretion,<br>
followed by (iv) extract-withdrawn acid secretion. For a particular stomach, after the<br>
basal secretion level is known, histamine is inserted from the nutrient side to see<br>
maximum acid secreting potential. Thereafter, an extract is inserted (first lower dose and<br>
then higher dose) from the nutrient side in presence of continuous supply of histamine to<br>
mimic ulcerative situation, followed by withdrawal of the extract by washing the nutrient<br>
side with histamine-containing nutrient medium. This latter phase is expected to generate<br>
information regarding the efficacy of the extract, upon its withdrawal, towards inhibiting<br>
the continuously existing acid secreting phase.<br>
Experiments are carried out with in vitro preparations of gastric mucosa mounted<br>
over one end of a plastic tube (mounted area is 1.76 cm2) with the mucosal surface facing<br>
out. The mounted tissue is placed vertically inside a 25-ml container. The nutrient<br>
solution is regular Frog Ringer solution and the luminal side (secretory side) is bathed in<br>
an unbuffered NaCl solution. The volumes of nutrient and mucosal solutions are adjusted<br>
in a way so as to be able to maintain constant hydrostatic pressure in the chamber<br>
throughout the duration of the experiment. Both solutions are slowly and continuously<br>
bubbled with Oj during the entire duration of the experiment. The mucosal solution is<br>
slowly and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer and collected at 15-min intervals<br>
in thoroughly washed clean vials.<br>
In a standardized protocol, 0.1-0.2 mM histamine is used as ulcerogen, while two<br>
doses of plant extracts (10 &amp; 50 mg) are used to generate optimum results.<br>
Experimentally, each of basal acid secretion, histamine-stimulated acid secretion, druginduced<br>
acid secretion (low followed by high doses) and drug-withdrawn acid secretion<br>
are continued for one hour each. The pH of the nutrient sides was monitored over time by<br>
accurately measuring the pH values (under NI bubbled condition), which is a fair<br>
reflection of the concentration of proton generated in a particular vial.<br>
Control experiments with two anti-ulcer drugs, namely, cimetidine (H2 receptor<br>
blocker) and omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) were carried out with a series of frog<br>
stomach mucosae. The results indicate that under the above-standardised experimental<br>
conditions, a concentration of 0.1-0.2 mM of cimetidine (added from nutrient side) or 1-<br>
10 uM omeprazole (added from secretory side) is enough to block almost complete acid<br>
secretion. This value has been taken to compare the efficacy of various extracts under<br>
similar experimental conditions.<br>
In other words, about 0.1-0.2 mM histamine was used as ulcerogen, while two<br>
doses of extracts (10 &amp; 50 mg) were used to generate optimum effects. Experimentally,<br>
each of basal acid secretion, histamine-stimulated acid secretion, drug-induced acid<br>
secretion (low followed by high doses) and drug-withdrawn acid secretion were<br>
continued for one hour each. Control experiment with two anti-ulcer drugs, namely,<br>
cimetidine (Hi receptor blocker) and omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) indicated that a<br>
concentration of 0.1-0.2 mM of cimetidine (added from nutrient side) or 1-10 uM<br>
omeprazole (added from secretory side) could block almost complete acid secretion<br>
under the standardized experimental conditions. Quantitative analysis of the results were<br>
finally formalized to a qualitative scoring pattern, wherein the rank score for both<br>
cimetidine and omeprazole (considered as 100%) were given as +8.<br>
Extract<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
 Inhibition of the maximum acid secreting potential of histamine-stimulated<br>
stomach in presence of low (10 mg) followed by high (50 mg) dose of sample has been<br>
graded as Low, Moderate, Very Good and Excellent category.<br>
 Blocking of the Reversal of acid secretion upon withdrawal of sample from the<br>
chamber which still contained histamine has been graded as Poor, Mild, Good and<br>
Excellent category.<br>
The extract A-002 showed moderate to poor activity when the applicant originally<br>
screened different extracts. However, based on other models, when the applicant<br>
examined the activities in two fractions, namely, F-006 &amp; F-007, as well as in mother<br>
fraction A-002, the applicant surprisingly observed excellent anti HC1 secreting potential<br>
of the fraction F-007. However, the fraction F-006 continued to show rather moderate<br>
potential as far as anti acid secreting potential is concerned. This is an interesting<br>
observation of immense scientific curiosity. The observation was confirmed and<br>
reconfirmed with fresh extracts in all three above fractions.<br>
3. Anti Gastric Proton Pump Activity Study: Gastric H+,K+-ATPase-rich<br>
membranes were prepared from freshly slaughtered pig stomach. These membranes are<br>
primarily enriched in tubulovescicular and apical membranes, and showed K+-stimulated<br>
activity (H+,K+-ATPase) of around 40 umoles Pj/mg/h with basal activity (Mg2+-ATPase)<br>
of only around 5-10 ^moles Pj/mg/h. An otherwise complete assay mixture containing<br>
about 10-15 |o,g membranes and different amount (1-10 |ag) of the extracts were preincubated<br>
for 10 min before initiating the reaction with substrate ATP. K+-stimulated<br>
activity, referred to as H'f,K+-ATPase, was calculated as the difference between the<br>
activities obtained in presence of Mg2+ plus K+ and the basal activity (Mg +-ATPase) in<br>
presence of Mg~+ alone.<br>

condition produces around 50-100% inhibition in the dose range of 0.3-3.0 jig/assay. The<br>
extract A-002 showed about 60-85% inhibition at a concentration of 1 fag/assay. Upon<br>
further fractionation, while the fraction F-006 showed 80-90% inhibition, the fraction F-<br>
007 showed 65-85% inhibition at 1 ^g/assay. Notwithstanding the presence of tannins in<br>
the extracts and their putative effects on H+,K+-ATPase, it seems logical to conclude that<br>
the observed high activity in all three extracts specially in fraction F-006 may be taken to<br>
mean that this fraction is perhaps of extreme promise as far as blocking of H+,K+-ATPase<br>
in vitro is concerned. The observation was confirmed and reconfirmed with fresh extracts<br>
in all three fractions.<br>
4. Anti //. pylori Activity - Disc Diffusion Sensitivity Test : The applicant has<br>
essentially monitored susceptibility or resistance of H. pylori against different<br>
concentrations of the extracts by Disc Diffusion Antibiotic Sensitivity Test on a<br>
quantitative basis. Two clinically isolated pure strains of Helicobacter pylori, one<br>
avirulent (strain 80A) and another virulent (strain 121A), were used for this study. The<br>
strains were maintained and cultured under laboratory conditions (Brain Heart Infusion<br>
Agar containing 7% PCS, 0.4% each of Isovitalex and H. pylori selective Dent). Fresh<br>
culture, grown in Brucella Broth containing 5% FCS, was uniformly spread over a<br>
selective media plate in which 4 discs (disc diameter 0.5 cm), impregnated with different<br>
concentrations of plant extract were placed. The extracts were dissolved in appropriate<br>
solvents (water, 50% methanol or methanol) and filter sterilised in case the solvent<br>
contained water. Appropriate control experiments with solvents were performed to negate<br>
their effects. The plates were kept for about 72 h in a double-gas programmable CC&gt;2<br>
Incubator under optimum growth conditions of 5% 62, 10% CCh, 85% N2 and more than<br>
95% humidity. After appropriate time of incubation, the inhibition zone was observed<br>
and the zone diameter of each discs was measured.<br>
Extract<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The standard antibiotic clarithromycin, at a concentration of 0.5 fag/disc, showed<br>
an inhibition zone diameter of around 2.3-2.7 cm. The fraction F-006 is appearing best<br>
among all fractions, since it is showing higher zones of inhibition at progressively lower<br>
concentrations. Nevertheless, all three fractions showed promising activity. The<br>
observation was confirmed and reconfirmed with fresh extracts in all three above<br>
fractions.<br>
Summary of Findings and Comments:<br>
(i) In Cold Restraint Stress Ulcer Model (Rat - in vivo), the fraction F-006 showed<br>
best protection (about 90%) as compared to parent extract (A-002) and F-007<br>
fraction. By Anti HC1 Secretion Potential (Isolated Frog Stomach - In organ)<br>
evaluation, the fraction F-007 showed hugely better anti HC1 secreting potential<br>
as compared to parent extract and F-006 fraction. In Gastric Proton Pump<br>
Inhibition studies, the fraction F-006 showed highest potential of about 80-90%<br>
inhibition of H+,K+-ATPase activity at 1 ug/assay (omeprazole blocked 50-100%<br>
at the concentration range of 0.3-3.0 u.g/assay), although both the mother extract<br>
(A-002) as well as F-007 fraction showed quite high activity. In Anti<br>
Helicobacter pylori Activity investigation, the fraction F-006 at a concentration of<br>
200 ug/disc, showed maximum zone of inhibition (disc diameter ~ 1.5-1.6 cm) as<br>
assessed by disc diffusion susceptibility test. However, both the mother extract<br>
(A-002) as well as F-007 fraction showed quite high activity. Clarithromycin<br>
showed disc diameter of about 2.3-2.7 cm at 0.5 μg/disc with both the strains.<br>
(ii) All the above observations could very well be confirmed and reconfirmed with<br>
fresh extracts, albeit with some variations. Repeat experiment with old extracts,<br>
showed in general slightly lower activity in majority of the cases, specially in anti<br>
H. pylori assessment experiments. Nevertheless, the relative strength or weakness<br>
of any particular fraction as compared to other two fractions always remained<br>
constant.<br>
(iii) Acute toxicity study in mice indicated that all three extracts, namely A-002, F-006<br>
and F-007, are non toxic at a dose of 1 g/kg (p. o.) when observed for 24-h<br>
mortality.<br>
(iv) Based on comparison with currently available standard medicines in appropriately<br>
employed experimental conditions, the following tentative conclusions may be<br>
derived. In terms of anti HC1 secretion potential, the relative efficacy of the<br>
fraction F-007 comes to about 1 : 10-20 as compared with cimetidine (F^ receptor<br>
blocked), and 1 : 100 as compared with omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor). In<br>
terms of anti Hf-pump inhibition studies, the relative efficacy of the fractions<br>
(better activity with F-006 fraction) as compared to omeprazole ranges around 1 :<br>
20-50. In terms of anti H. pylori activity, a rough comparison of the MIC values<br>
of F-006 and clarithromycin indicates relative efficacy of about 1 : 500-1000.<br>
(v) This investigation aims at looking into the underlying mechanism(s) of ulceration.<br>
Currently available single molecule, like omeprazole (proton pump blocker),<br>
cimetidine (Fb receptor blocker), antibiotic like clarithromycin (anti H. pylori) are<br>
all specifically designed to target those aetiologies which cause ulceration. Our<br>
experimental models include targeting the effect on H2 receptor (cimetidine like<br>
effect), on gastric proton pump (omeprazole like), on H. pylori killing efficiency<br>
employing antibiotic sensitivity assay (clarithromycin like) etc. Given the current<br>
trend in therapeutic management of peptic ulcer diseases, the applicant have not<br>
just mono therapy or double therapy, but triple therapy and even in some cases<br>
quadruple therapy. This patent intends to claim the control of majority of the<br>
therapeutic potential of the currently prevailing modern medicines by a single<br>
plant part.<br>
(vi) During screening exercise, the applicant did observe that different parts of this<br>
plant W. fruticosa showed quite good anti HC1 secreting potential as assessed in<br>
Frog Chamber model. The applicant examined three extracts, water, alcohol and<br>
50% alcohol extracts of other parts like stem bark, leaf, root etc. during screening<br>
exercise. Some of them, in fact, showed quite good anti HC1 secreting potential.<br>
(vii) The plant is easily available in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and different parts of Northeastern<br>
India. Its flowers, however, could only be collected during February-<br>
March in a year. Nevertheless, it is not at all difficult to collect lots of 5-10 kg of<br>
flower at a time. Considering the approximate yield of about 20 g of A-002<br>
fraction from 100 g of dried flower, it would not be difficult to prepare sufficient<br>
quantity for extensive clinical trials, and subsequent formulation for management<br>
of human peptic ulcer diseases.<br>
(viii) A rough estimate based on laboratory experimental data on different models used<br>
for bioevaluation vis-a-vis comparison with appropriate single molecule modern<br>
medicines (see above), and the rules for extrapolation for human dose (16), the<br>
applicant anticipate that possibly about 100-200 mg per day would be sufficient<br>
for management of human peptic ulcer diseases.<br>
( i x ) The plant has been reported to be used as folklore medicine in Indian<br>
subcontinent. Also the part flower is credited for the management of diseases like<br>
ulcer, haemorrhoids, dysentery, liver diseases, as well as for its reported activity<br>
against wound, coughs, microbes like Helminthosporium sativum [5], nowhere it<br>
has been mentioned for its specific use against ulcers of the stomach and/or<br>
duodenum, which encompasses the broad range of a diseases called peptic ulcer<br>
diseases. The present investigation specifically aimed at targeting the aetiology of<br>
gastric and/or duodenum ulcers by four experimental models covering almost the<br>
entire gamut of the pathological criteria of peptic ulcer disease. The term ulcer is<br>
a loosely held term encompassing sore or wound in any part, external or internal.<br>
In fact, the famous turmeric (Curcuma longd) which is reported to be effective<br>
against ulcers in general, shows contraindication against gastric ulcer,<br>
hyperacidity and peptic ulcer [Sreejayan, N., Rao, M. N. A., Arzneim Forsch<br>
Drug Res., 46,169 (1996); Arora, R.B., Basu, N. Kapoor, V., Jain, A.P., Ind.<br>
J.Med. Res,, 59, 1289 (1971); Kiso, Y., Suzuki, Y., Watnabe, N. Planta Med., 49,<br>
185 (1983)]. Further, research with turmeric (Curcuma longd) in people having<br>
stomach ulcers has not shown it to be superior to placebo [Van Dau, N., Ngoc<br>
Ham, N., Huy Khac, D., Phytomedicine 5, 29 (1998); Kositchaiwat, C.,<br>
Kositchaiwat, S., Havanondha, J. Med. Assoc. Thai, 76, 601 (1993]. The same is<br>
the case with garlic (Allium sativum L.) where it is reported to ameliorate infected<br>
wounds, hemorrhoids, antibacterial, but causes adverse effects on gastrointestinal<br>
disorders [Morbidoni, L., Arteburnjm, J. M., Young, V., Mullins, D., Mulrow, C.<br>
and Lawrence, V.,.J. Herbal Pharmacother. 1, 63 (2001)].<br>
