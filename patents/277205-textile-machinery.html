				<td>The invention relates to a textile machine having a plurality of winding devices arranged in line, each of the winding devices having an automatic dofflng device, and in particular, to a false-twist draw-texturing machine preferably. Background Art<br>
As a conventional false-twist texturing machine, for example, one is disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2002-309455 (Document 1) . The false-twist texturing machine of this document 1 has a layout in which work passages for a yarn guiding operation are provided on both sides of a center frame with a secondary heater, and on the opposite sides of the center frame across the workpassages, winder frames having winding devices are disposed, respectively. Each of the winding devices is provided with an automatic doffing device, and a full winding package formed by each winding device is discharged out to a package discharging passage side opposite the work passage by the automatic doffing device corresponding to the winding device.<br>
 <br>
2<br>
In this false-twist texturing machine of the document 1, a winder frame is disposed on one side of the center frame across a work passage, and on the other side of the center frame, a winder frame is also disposed across the work passage (three-frame structure) . Therefore, the frame width (lateral length in Fig. 3 of the document) increases, and there is room for improvement in downsizing. In additlon, the full winding package automatically doffed is dlscharged to the side opposite the work passage as described above, so that the recovery workability is not good.<br>
On the other hand, the false-twist draw-texturing machine disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2005-67790 (document 2) is constructed so that the package can be discharged to the workpassage side and the winding devices are disposed on the center frame.<br>
However, this false-twist draw-texturing machine of the document 2 has a package discharge portion on the work passage side, so that the depth from the work passage to the secondary heater of the center frame increases. Therefore, it becomes difficult to maintain the winding tube support member (cradle) and the drive part of the automatlc doffing device disposed on the secondary heater side.<br>
Furthermore, it is also known that the winding devices<br>
 <br>
3<br>
are disposed on the center frame in the same manner as in the false-twist texturing machine of the document 2, and furthermore, a traverse device is disposed farther than the winding position from the work passage and a yarn is introduced from the opposite side (back side) of the work passage.<br>
However, since the traverse device is disposed on the side deeper than the winding position, maintenance of the traverse device becomes difficult. In addition, a threading device with a special structure for guiding a yarn to the winding position becomes necessary, and this increases the costs. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The problem to be solved by the invention is as described above, and next, means for solving the problem and an effect thereof are described.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a textile machine constructed as follows is provided. Namely, a plurality of winding devices are arranged in line, and each of the winding devices individually has an automatic doffing device. Each of the winding devices has a winding tube support member that rotatably supports a winding tube for winding a yarn, and a traverse device for traversing the yarn to be wound around the winding tube. In each of the winding devices the automatic doffing device has a drive part that can rotatively<br>
 <br>
4<br>
move the winding tube support member. The center of rotative movement of the winding tube support member, the drive part, and the traverse device are disposed on one side with respect to a vertical plane which has the center of rotation of the winding tube when the yarn is wound within the plane.<br>
Thereby, a layout in which the center of rotative movement, the drive part, and the traverse device are collected at one side of the windlng tube at winding is reallzed. Therefore, the textile machine can be constructed compact.<br>
In addition, in the layout, the device group including the drive part and the traverse device that need maintenance and management is collected on one side of the winding tube at winding, so that maintenance becomes easy.<br>
Particularly, by disposing a work passage on only the same side as the side where the device group including the traverse device, etc., are disposed, the compactness of the textile machine can be improved, and an operator can easily access the device group through the work passage, resulting in excellent workability in maintenance.<br>
In the textile machlne, the following construction is preferable. Namely, a waiting position for extracting a full winding package doffed by the automatic doffing device is disposed on one side which the center of rotative movement of<br>
 <br>
5<br>
the winding tube support member, the drive part, and the traverse device are provided on with respect to the vertical plane.<br>
With the construction described above, the waiting position for extracting the full winding package is also collected on one side, so that increased compactness can be obtained. In addltion, the work passage through which an operator extracts the full windlng package that has been doffed and put on standby and the work passage through which the operator performs maintenance and management of the drive part, the traverse device, etc. , and guides a yarn to the winding devices can be made common, so that the number of work passages can be reduced, resulting in improvement in compactness. Furthermore, the full winding package extraction and maintenance and yarn guiding operation can be performed from one side, and this improves the workability.<br>
Preferably, the textile machine is constructed as follows . Namely, a pair of the winding tube support members are provided. Jointing means for joining the palr of a winding tube support members is provided at a position different from the centers of rotative movement of the winding tube support members.<br>
With the construction described above, the rigidity of the pair of the winding tube support members is improved, and oscillation such as bending and twisting of the winding tube<br>
 <br>
6<br>
support members can be restrained. Thereby, the winding tube can always be maintained in a preferable posture.<br>
In the textile machine described above, it is preferable that the vertical plane is located between the joining means and the centers of rotative movement of the winding tube support members.<br>
With the above-described construction, the joining means does not obstruct movement of the full winding package to the waiting position.<br>
In the textile maehine, preferably, the waiting position for extracting the full winding package is provided on a member that cannot swing.<br>
With the above-described construction, the full winding package that is a heavy item can be made to stably wait.<br>
In the textile machine described above, preferably, the center of a full winding package at the waiting position for extraction is positioned at almost the same height as the center of rotative movement of the winding tube support member.<br>
With the above-described construction, the difference in height in movement of the full winding package to be removed from the winding tube support member to the waiting position is reduced, so that great oscillation can be prevented during the movement to the waiting position.<br>
 <br>
7<br>
Preferably, the textile machine described above is constructed as follows. Namely, guide means for moving a full winding package removed from the winding tube support member by the automatic doffing device to the waiting position is provided in the winding tube support member.<br>
With the above-described construction, the winding tube support member commonly serves as the guide means, whereby the number of parts can be reduced and the construction can be made simple.<br>
In the textile machine described above, preferably, the guide means is a rolling guide surface.<br>
With the above-described construction, the guide means can be easily realized only by providing a preferable surface in the winding tube support member.<br>
Preferably, the above-described textile machine is constructed as follows. Namely, each of the automatic doffing devices further has an empty winding tube holding mechanism for holding the empty winding tube in a releasable manner. The winding tube support member is rotatively moved by the drive part to the position of the empty winding tube on standby while being held by the empty winding tube holding mechanism and receives the empty winding tube.<br>
With the above-described construction, lt is not necessary<br>
 <br>
8<br>
to drive the empty winding tube holding mechanism when attaching an empty winding tube to the winding tube support member, so that the empty winding tube holding mechanism can be made simple. In addition, the winding tube support member commonly performs the function for receiving an empty winding tube, so that the number of parts of the automatic doffing device can be reduced.<br>
Preferably, the above-described textile machine is constructed as follows. Namely, each of the automatic doffing devices further has an empty winding tube holding mechanism for holding the empty winding tube in a releasable manner. The distance from the center of rotative movement of the winding tube support member to the winding position of the winding tube at winding and the distance from the center of rotative movement of the winding tube support member to the empty winding tube held by the empty winding tube holding mechanism are equal to each other.<br>
With the above-described construction, it is not necessary to drive the empty winding tube holding mechanism when attaching an empty winding tube to the winding tube support member, so that the empty winding tube holding mechanism can be made simple . In addition, only by rotatively moving the winding tube support member, the empty winding tube can be received from the empty winding tube holding mechanism, so that the number of parts<br>
 <br>
9<br>
of the automatic doffing device can be reduced.<br>
Preferably, the textile machine described above is<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a false-twist draw-texturing machine as an embodiment of the textile machine of the invention is described with reference to the drawings.<br>
The false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 shown in Fig. 5 has, in order along the running of a yarn 2, a yarn supplying part 1A, a processing part 1B, and a winding part 1C as main components. The yarn supplying part 1A is structured so as to hold a yarn supply package 101. The processing part 1B applies draw-texturing to a yarn 2 supplied from the yarn supply package 101. Then, the winding part 1C winds the yarn 2 textured by the processing part 1B as winding package 3a.  In each station, the yarn supplying part 1A and the winding part 1C are disposed to face each other across a work passage 120 described later.<br>
The false-twist draw-texturingmachine 100 has a plurality of processing units (hereinafter, referred to as "stations") each of which has the yarn supplying part 1A, the processing part 1B, and the winding part 1C. These stations are installed in line in a direction perpendicular to the sheet of Fig. 5. For reducing the installing space, the yarn supplying parts IA and the winding parts 1C of, for example, two through four stations (three stations in the embodiment) are stacked up. The yarn supplying part 1A of each station is provided<br>
 <br>
13<br>
with a peg 201 for supporting the yarn supply package 101, and each peg 201 is attached to a creel stand 202 that is common for the plurality of stations.<br>
The processing part 1B of each station has, in order along the advancing direction of the yarn 2, a first feed roller 110,  primary heater 102, a cooling device 103, a false twisting device 104, a second feed roller 111, a secondary heater 105, and a third feed roller 112.<br>
The first feed roller 110, the second feed roller 111, and the third feed roller 112 are devices for feeding the yarn 2, and their yarn feeding speeds are set so that the yarn feeding speed of the second feed roller 111 becomes higher than that of the first feed roller 110. Therefore, the yarn 2 is drawn between the first feed roller 110 and the second feed roller 111. Their yarn feeding speeds are set so that the yarn feeding speed of the third feed roller 112 becomes lower than that of the second feed roller 111. Therefore, the yarn 2 is loosened between the second feed roller 111 and the third feed roller 112.<br>
The yarn 2 drawn between the first feed roller 110 and the second feed roller 111 is subjected to twisting by the false twisting device 104. In detail, the yarn 2 is twisted between the first feed roller 110 and the false twisting device 104.<br>
 <br>
14<br>
The yarn 2 twisted while being drawn is subjected to heat setting by the primary heater 102 and then cooled by the cooling device 103 (cooling plate) . The twisted and heat-set yarn 2 is untwisted before the second feed roller lll after passing through the false twisting device 104. The yarn 2 thus drawn and false-twisted is subjected to loosening heat treatment by the secondary heater 105, and wound as winding package 3a by the winding part 1C.<br>
The winding part 1C is provided on one side of the center frame having the secondary heater 105. On one side (opposite side of the side provided with the secondary heater 105) of the winding part 1C, a work passage 120 is provided. The work passage 120 is formed as a work space given for an unillustrated operator to perform maintenance and management of the false twisting device 104 and the winding part 1C. In detail, this work passage 120 is used as a work space by an operator to perform a yarn guiding operation and extract a full winding package, described later, and supply a empty winding tube.<br>
The yarn guiding operation is an operation for guiding the yarn 2 from the yarn supplying part 1A to the winding part iC through the processing part 1B, including the work for guiding the yarn 2 to the yarn guiding means described later in the winding part 1C.<br>
 <br>
15<br>
In the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 of this embodiment, the plurality of stations at the left side of Fig. 5 and the plurality of stations at the right side of the figure are disposed symmetrically.  In detail, two center frames each of which has a secondary heater 105 on one side are disposed back to back so that their secondary heaters 105 face each other. The secondary heaters 105 disposed to the left and right adjacent to each other in the figure are set for the left and right stations, respectively.  On both sides of the secondary heaters 105, winding parts 1C of the left and right stations are disposed, respectively, and the winding parts 1C of the left and right stations are disposed to face each other across the secondary heaters 105.  Furthermore, on both sides of the left and right winding parts 1C disposed close to each other as described above, work passages 120 are further disposed. Furthermore, on both sides of the left and right work passages 120, yarn supplying parts 1A of the left and right stations are disposed and a layout is formed.<br>
Next, with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the construction of the winding part 1C is explained. This winding part 1C has a winding function for winding the yarn 2 drawn and false twisted as a winding package 3a and a doffing function for doffing a full winding package 3b.<br>
 <br>
16<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, etc., the winding part 1C has a winding device 50 for winding the yarn 2, and this winding device 50 is provided with an automatic doffing device 60. This automatic doffing device 60 is constructed so as to remove a full winding package 3b from the winding device 50, attach a new empty winding tube 3 to the winding device 50, and set the yarn 2 around the new empty winding tube 3. Thereby, the winding part 1C can continuously wind the yarn 2 by the winding device 50 while replacing the winding tube 3. The automatic doffing device 60 is individually provided in the winding device 50 of each winding part 1C of the stations for each winding part 1C (for each station).<br>
The winding device 50 has a pair of the cradle arms (winding tube support members) 4, a contact roller (winding tube rotating rotor) 5, and a traverse device 6 as main components. The pair of the cradle arms 4 are formed so as to rotatably sandwich the winding tube 3. This winding tube 3 is for winding the yarn that has been drawn, false twisted and fed to the winding device 50. In this embodiment, the yarn 2 that has passed through the false twisting device 104 and the secondary heater 105 is guided into the winding part IC (winding device 50) from the work passage 120 side. The contact roller 5 drives and rotates the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a) in a predetermined<br>
 <br>
17<br>
direction, whereby winding the yarn 2 around the winding tube 3. The traverse device 6 is provided for traversing the yarn 2 with respect to the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a). The automatic doffing device 60 has a cradle lifting part (drive part) 7, a pair of the ejecting concave portions 8, a pair of the rolling guide surfaces 9 as guide means, a stocker (empty winding tube holding mechanism 10) , and a yarn setting means (not shown) as main components. The cradle lifting part 7 is constructed so as to individually rotatlvely move a cradle 40 formed by the pair of the cradle arms 4 for each station. The ejecting concave portions 8 are formed so that the ends of the winding tube 3 are dropped into the ejecting concave portions 8 to make the full winding package 3b wait at a waiting position for extracting.  The rolling guide surfaces 9 are provided for rolling the full winding package 3b due to its weight from the winding position to the pair of the ejecting concave portions 8. The stocker 10 can stock a plurality of empty winding tubes 3. The yarn setting means suctions and holds the end of the yarn guided to the winding device 50, and places the end of the yarn around the empty winding tube 3 held by the cradle arms 4.<br>
Next, the components are described in detail.<br>
The winding tube 3 is for winding the yarn 2 that has<br>
 <br>
18<br>
been drawn and false-twisted, and is formed into a roughly columnar shape so as to smoothly wind the yarn 2 at a constant speed. The winding tube 3 is rotatably supported by the pair of the cradle arms 4 via bobbin holders (winding tube support structures) 4a. The winding tube 3 is detachably sandwiched between the cradle arms 4, and when it is attached to the cradle arms 4, the center of axis (center of rotation 3c) becomes parallel to a center of axes of the contact roller 5 described later.<br>
The contact roller 5 rotates the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a) at a preferable speed in a predetermined direction around the center of rotation 3c to wind the yarn 2. In detail, a pair of substrates 90 are projected from unillustrated beams provided on the opposite side with respect to the passage 120 of the winding part 1C (hereinafter also referred to as "opposite-passage side, ") and the contact roller 5 is rotatably supported on the base end sides of the substrates 90. For convenience of illustration, the substrate 90 is shown by the alternate long and short double dashed lines in Fig. 1, etc.<br>
The contact roller 5 is driven and rotated by a shaft 5a extending in the direction perpendicular to the sheet of the drawing of Fig. 1. This shaft 5a is common for the plurality of winding parts 1C installed in line in the direction<br>
 <br>
19<br>
perpendicular to the sheet of the drawing of Fig. 5, and is driven and rotated at a constant speed by an unillustrated drive source.<br>
The cradle arms 4 are paired as shown in Fig. 2, and at almost the middle parts in the longitudinal directions of the cradle arms 4, bobbin holders 4a are provided, and can rotatably sandwich the winding tube 3 via the bobbin holders 4a . One-side ends of the cradle arms 4 are rotatably supported on the front end upper portions of the substrates 90 (the upper portions of the work passage 120 side ends of the substrates 90) . The centers of rotatably supported portions are the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle 40, and the bobbin holders 4a are disposed closer to the opposite-passage side than the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle 40.<br>
The pair of cradle arms 4 extend to the opposite-passage side, and the front ends thereof are joined to each other by a joint portion 4c. Namely, this joint portion 4c is positioned closer to the opposite-passage side than the bobbin holders 4a. This joint portion 4c increases the rigidity of the cradle 40 and restrains oscillation such as bending and twisting of the cradle arms 4, whereby the winding tube 3 can always be securely maintained in a preferable posture. As a result, a conformable winding package 3a can be formed.  In addition,<br>
 <br>
2O<br>
excessive external forces can be prevented from being applied to the bobbin holders 4a due to the oscillation, so that the bobbin holders 4a can be prevented from being damaged.<br>
The traverse device 6 is for traversing the yarn 2 with respect to the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a) . As shown in Fig. 1, the traverse device 6 is disposed so that the placement position of the traverse device 6 and the contact position between the winding tube 3 and the contact roller 5 are arranged in order along the advancing direction of the yarn 2. And the traverse device 6 is disposednear the contact roller 5 . Namely, the traverse device 6 is provided closer to the work passage 120 (yarn introducing side viewed from the center of rotation 3c) than the center of rotation 3c.<br>
The cradle lifting part 7 is for rotatively moving the cradle 40 when doffing as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, and as shown in Fig. 1, it is disposed closer to the work passage 120 than the center of rotation 3c of the winding tube 3.<br>
This cradle lifting part 7 has a drive cam 7a to be properly joined to a drive shaft 91 as a drive source provided at the front end lower portion of the substrates 90, and a drive transmitting arm 7b that joins one point of the drive cam 7a and one point of one cradle arm 4 and transmits a drive force of the drive shaft 91 to the cradle 40 . An unillustrated clutch<br>
 <br>
21<br>
mechanism is interposed between the drive cam 7a and the drive shaft 91, and by this clutch mechanism, the power from the drive shaft 91 is conducted to or cut from the cradle lifting part 7.<br>
As described above, regarding the winding part 1C of this embodiment, the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle arms 4, the cradle lifting part 7, and the traverse device 6 are provided on the same side (workpassage 120 side) with respect to the center of rotation 3C of the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a). In other words, when a virtual vertical plane (plane P shown in Fig. 1) which has the center of rotation 3c of the winding tube 3 within the plane is assumed, the three members are provided on one side (work passage 120 side) with respect to the vertical plane P.<br>
Thereby, a layout in which the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle arms 4, the cradle lifting part 7, and the traverse device 6 are collected on one side (the same side) with respect to the winding tube 3 at winding, so that the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 (winding part 1C) can be formed compact.<br>
In addition, the device group including the cradle lifting part 7 and the traverse device 6 that need maintenance and management is collected on one side with respect to the winding<br>
 <br>
22<br>
tube 3 at winding, so that maintenance becomes easy.<br>
In addition, in the false-twist draw-texturing machine I00 in this embodiment, the work passage 120 is disposed on the same side as the side provided with the device group, so that an operator easily accesses the device group through the work passage 120, resulting in easy maintenance.<br>
Next, the ejecting concave portions 8 are explained. The pair of ejecting concave portions 8 shown in Fig. 1, etc., are for temporarily stocking a full winding package 3b which a predetermined amount has been wound around and is discharged until an operator extracts it. In the winding part 1C, a new winding tube 3 can be attached to the bobbin holders 4a and a yarn can be wound around it while the full winding package 3b waits at the pair of ejecting concave portions 8.<br>
The pair of ejecting concave portions 8 are provided so as to horizontally face each other at the front end upper portions of the pair of substrates 90. The concave positions of the ejecting concave portions 8 are disposed closer to the work passage 120 than the center of rotation 3c of the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a) and the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle arms 4.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, in the winding part 1C, four members including the pair of ejecting concave<br>
 <br>
23<br>
portions 8 in addition to said three members are all provided on one side (work passage 120 side) with respect to the virtual vertical plane P shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Thereby, the work passage for an operator to extract the full winding package 3b that has been doffed and is waiting and the workpassage formaintenance and management of the cradle lifting part 7 and the traverse device 6, etc., and for a yarn guiding operation can be made common, whereby the number of work passages can be reduced. Therefore, the whole of the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 can be made compact. Namely, the compact layout shown in Fig. 5 in which two winding parts 1C are disposed back to back becomes possible . In addition, the yarn guiding operation and the operation for extracting the full winding package 3b can be performed from the same work passage, resulting in excellent workability. Furthermore, maintenance of the cradle lifting part 7 and the traverse device 6 can be easily performed. Moreover, the distance from the work passage 120 to the secondary heater 105 can be shortened, and the yarn guiding operation to the secondary heater 105 becomes easy.<br>
The pair of rolling guide surfaces 9 is rolling guide means for rolling the full winding package 3b toward the pair of ejecting concave portions 8 from the winding position.  The<br>
 <br>
24<br>
rolling guide surfaces 9 are provided on surfaces facing each other of the pair of cradle arms 4.<br>
By the rolling guide surfaces 9, the full winding package 3b moves to the ejecting concave portions 8, and the full winding package 3b is discharged. Namely, after completing winding, the full winding package 3b is separated from the contact roller 5 by the cradle lifting part 7, and while the center of axis of the full winding package 3b becomes slightly higher than the centers of rotative movement 4b, sandwiching of the full winding package 3b by the bobbin holders 4a is released. Then, the full winding package 3b rolls due to its own weight on the rolling guide surfaces 9 while the ends of the winding tube 3 are supported by the pair of rolling guide surfaces 9, and then moves to the pair of ejecting concave portions 8 and waits there.<br>
Heremn, the ejecting concave portions 8 are provided on the substrates 90 that cannot swing, so that they can stably support the full winding package 3b that is considerably heavy at the waiting position on the ejecting concave portions 8.<br>
In addition, the cradle arms 4 commonly serve as guide means to discharge the full winding package 3b, whereby the number of parts can be reduced and the construction of the winding part IC becomes simple. Only by forming proper surfaces on<br>
 <br>
25<br>
the cradle arms 4, the guide means can be easily provided. Furthermore, the joint portion 4c is provided on the opposite side of the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle 40 across the vertical plane P, so that the joint portion 4c does not disturb the movement of the full winding package 3b to the pair of the ejecting concave portions 8.<br>
In addition, when the full winding package 3b is at the waiting position (the position shown by the chain line of Fig. 3), the center of the full winding package 3b is positioned at almost the same height as the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle arms 4. Therefore, the difference in height in movement of the full winding package 3b to be removed from the cradle arms 4 to the waiting position is reduced, so that, for example, the inclination of the rolling guide surfaces 9 can be made smaller. Therefore, it can be prevented that the full winding package 3b moves at a speed higher than necessary to the waiting position or great oscillation occurs when the full winding package 3b moves to the ejecting concave portions 8.<br>
The stocker 10 is constructed as shown in Fig. 1 so as to hold a plurality (3 at most in this embodiment) of empty winding tubes 3 in a releasable manner. This stocker 10 has an extracting opening 10d, and at this extracting opening 10d,<br>
 <br>
26<br>
empty tube holders 10a and 10b made of an elastic material are provided. With this construction, the winding tube 3 at the extracting opening 10d is held by the empty tube holders 10a and 10b, and by elastically deforming the empty tube holders 10a and 10b, the winding tubes 3 can be extracted one by one from the extracting opening 10d.<br>
When an empty winding tube 3 is extracted from the extracting opening 10d, the residual winding tubes 3 naturally move to the extracting opening 10d due to their weights so that the next and subsequent winding tubes 3 can also be smoothly extracted.<br>
The stocker 10 is fixed by unillustrated fixing means at the upper side of the substrates 90. This stocker 10 is disposed closer to the work passage 120 than the vertical plane P which has the center of rotation 3c of the winding tube 3 at winding within the plane. In other words, the stocker I0 and the centers of rotative movement 4b of the cradle arms 4 are disposed on the same side (one side) with respect to the vertical plane P.<br>
In addition, the stocker 10 has a supply port 10c for additionally supplying an empty winding tube 3 on the opposite side of the side provided with the extracting opening 10d. This supply port 10c is disposed on the opposite side of the vertical<br>
 <br>
27<br>
plane P across the extracting opening 10d. Namely, the empty winding tube 3 at the extracting position in the stocker 10 is disposed closer to the vertical plane P than other supplied empty winding tubes 3. In other words, when the distance from the winding position of the winding tube 3 at winding to the empty winding tube 3 at the extracting position in the stocker 10 is defined as A and the distance from the winding position of the winding tube 3 at winding to another supplied empty winding tube 3 adjacent to the empty winding tube 3 at the extracting position in the stocker 10 is defined as B, A is shorter than B.<br>
In this embodiment, the supply port 10c is provided on the side facing the work passage 120. Therefore, an operator can easily supply an empty winding tube 3 into the stocker i0 via the supply port 10c from the work passage 120.<br>
In this embodiment, when the distance from the centers of rotative movement 4b of the pair of the cradle arms 4 to the winding position of the winding tube 3 at winding is defined as C, and the distance from the centers of rotative movement 4b of the pair of the cradle arms 4 to the empty winding tube 3 at the extracting position held by the empty tube holders 10a and 10b is defined as D, C is equal to D.<br>
Therefore, only by rotatively moving the pair of the cradle<br>
 <br>
28<br>
arms 4 by the cradle lifting part 7 to the position of the empty winding tube 3 that is held by the empty tube holders 10a and 10b of the stocker 10 and is waiting, the pair of the bobbin holders 4a of the pair of the cradle arms 4 overlap this empty winding tube 3, and the cradle 40 can receive this empty winding tube 3 via the pair of the bobbin holders 4a.<br>
At this time, the direction of extracting this empty winding tube 3 is the direction of separating from another empty winding tube 3 held by the stocker 10, so that the empty winding tube 3 at the extracting position can be extracted from the stocker 10 without interference with the adjacent empty winding tube 3.<br>
The yarn setting means (not shown) temporarily holds the end of the yarn reaching the winding device 50 from the yarn supply package 101, and automatically places the end of the yarn around the empty winding tube 3 held at the center of rotation 3c. By this yarn setting means, a new winding process at the winding device 50 can be automatically started.<br>
The yarn 2 properly guided to the winding part 1C from the opposite-passage side is finally guided to the traverse device 6 via a yarn guide 20 provided on the work passage 120 side of the winding part 1C.<br>
Next, operations of the false-twist draw-texturing<br>
 <br>
29<br>
machine 100 relating to the embodiment are described.<br>
As described above, the yarn 2 supplied from the yarn supplying part 1A reaches the winding part 1C after subjected to false-twist draw-texturing by the processing part 1B. Explaining the winding process with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the yarn 2 is placed around the outer circumferential surface of the winding tube 3 in advance, and the winding tube 3 comes into contact with the contact roller 5 and rotates to wind the yarn 2 as a winding package 3a.<br>
In this winding, the contact roller 5 rotates at a constant speed, so that the speed of the outer circumferential surface of the winding package 3a is always kept constant. The yarn 2 is traversed on the winding tube 3 (winding package 3a) by the traverse device 6, so that the outer circumferential surface of the winding package 3a always becomes a roughly cylindrical shape at winding. The center of axis of the winding tube 3 and the center of axes of the contact roller 5 are parallel to each other, so that the outer circumferential surface of the winding tube 3 comes into contact with the contact rollers 5 without fail, and they are prevented from slipping between each other.<br>
To the cradle 40, an urging means (not shown) formed by an elastic member such as a coil spring or a leaf spring or<br>
 <br>
30<br>
a proper cam mechanism is attached, and by this urging means, the cradle 40 is urged so as to approach the contact roller 5. The free ends of the cradle arms 4 are joined to each other by the joint portion 4c, whereby the rigidity of the cradle 40 is increased to prevent oscillation such as bending and twisting and prevent fluctuation in posture of the winding tube 3 supported by the cradle 40.<br>
The winding package 3a Increases its outer diameter according to winding (wind-thickening), and according to this, the cradle 40 swings about the centers of rotative movement 4b while sandwiching the winding package 3a, whereby absorbing the increase in outer diameter.<br>
With the above-described construction, a preferable urging force can be applied by the urging means to the winding tube 3 regardless of the diameter of the winding tube. In addition, the speed on the outer circumferential surface of the winding tube 3 when winding is kept constant, and the yarn 2 can be wound in an excellent condition without yarn cutting or yarn loosening.<br>
At this time, the clutch mechanism provided at the cradle lifting part 7 is disconnected until the winding is finished since the winding is started, and the cradle 40 is urged to approach the contact rollers 5 by the urging means as described<br>
 <br>
31<br>
above. Therefore, the angle of rotational movement of the cradle 40 is determined depending on the diameter of the winding package 3a.<br>
Next, based on Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, processes until the full winding package 3b is removed and replaced with an empty winding tube 3 and the next winding is started are explained.<br>
In Fig. 3, a full winding package 3b that is in contact with the contact roller 5 and sandwiched by the pair of the bobbin holders 4a is shown by a dashed line. As shown by this dashed line, when the winding package 3a turns into a fully wound condition, the automatic doffing device 60 cuts the yarn 2 connected to the full winding package 3b with an unillustrated cutter, and as shown in Fig. 4, the end of the yarn 2 (the end on the yarn supply package 101 side) is sucked and held by unillustrated yarn sucking means. Simultaneously, the drive cam 7a and the drive shaft 91 are switched into a contact state by the clutch mechanism.<br>
Then, the cradle 40 is driven to rotatively move upward around the centers of rotative movement 4b, and the full winding package 3b sandwiched by the pair of the bobbin holders 4a rises to the position of the solid line of Fig. 3. Thereby, the outer circumferential surface of the full winding package 3b separates from the outer circumferential surfaces of the contact roller<br>
 <br>
32<br>
5, and the rolling guide surfaces 9 provided on the cradle arms 4 tilt into a down slope slightly lowering toward the workpassage 120 side.<br>
After the cradle 40 rotatively moves as described above, the sandwiching of the full winding package 3b by the bobbin holders 4a is released. Then, as shown by the arrow of Fig. 3, the full winding package 3b rolls on the rolling guide surfaces 9a due to its own weight toward the ejecting concave portions 8 . Then, as shown by the alternate long and short double dashed lines of the figure, the full winding package 3b reaches the pair of the ejecting concave portions 8 and waits there.<br>
After the full winding package 3b moves to the ejecting concave portions 8, the cradle 40 rotatively moves upward as shown in Fig. 4 until the center of axis of the leading empty winding tube 3 held by the empty tube holders 10a and 10b of the stocker 10 and the centers of axes of the bobbin holders 4a roughly match each other. In this state, the pair of the bobbin holders 4a sandwich the empty winding tube 3, whereby the empty winding tube 3 is attached to the cradle 40. Thereafter, the cradle liftingpart 7 rotatively moves the cradle 40 downward until the empty winding tube 3 comes into contact with the contact rollers 5 . And almost simultaneously with contact between these, the clutch mechanism is disconnected. Thereby, the cradle 40<br>
 <br>
33<br>
presses the empty winding tube 3 sandwiched by the pair of the bobbin holders 4a against the contact rollers 5 by an urging force of the urging means, so that the empty winding tube 3 starts rotating accordingly.<br>
Then, the yarn 2 held by the yarn sucking means is placed around the outer circumferential surface of the rotating winding tube 3 by the yarn setting means (not shown), and the yarn 2 starts being wound again around the winding tube 3.<br>
In the attaching process of the empty winding tube 3 to the winding part 1C, an empty winding tube 3 held at the extracting opening 10d of the stocker 10 is extracted so as to separate from other empty winding tubes 3 held by the stocker 10 according to the rotational movement of the cradle 40. Therefore, it is smoothly extracted without interference between the empty winding tubes 3.<br>
As described above, in the winding part 1C, the yarn 2 is wound around the winding tube 3 by the winding device 50. Then, when a predetermined length is wound and forms full winding, the full winding package 3b is moved to the ejecting concave portions 8 by the automatic doffing device 60, and thereafter, the cradle 40 receives an empty winding tube 3, the yarn 2 is placed around the received winding tube 3 by the yarn setting means, and winding is restarted.<br>
 <br>
34<br>
An operator waiting in the work passage 120 extracts the full winding package 3b moved to the ejecting concave portions 8, and properly supplies an additional empty winding tube 3 into the stocker 10 via the supply port 10c.<br>
The traverse device 6 and the cradle lifting part 7 needs maintenance and management, and these works include various works, for example, damly works such as cleaning and lubricating and non-daily works such as eliminating winding failure and repairing. Furthermore, a yarn guiding operation for initial winding starts after yarn cutting or maintenance is also included.<br>
The works of an operator described above can be easily performed since the centers of rotative movement 4b, the traverse device 6, the cradle lifting part 7, the ejecting concave portions 8, and the stocker 10 are disposed closer to the work passage 120 than the windlng position of the winding tube 3. In addition, this layout in which the five members are collected on one side with respect to the winding position of the winding tube 3 makes it possible to construct the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 compact.<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, the yarn guiding operation, the operation for extracting a full winding package 3b, the operation for supplying an empty winding tube 3, and<br>
 <br>
35<br>
the maintenance of the traverse device 6 and the cradle lifting part 7 can be performed from the same side (yarn introducing side). Therefore, the work passage for the works described above set on only one side with respect to the winding part 1C is enough, and the work passage can be commonly used as the work passage 120. Therefore, a compact layout of the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100, in particular, a layout compact in the frame width direction (the lateral direction on the sheet of Fig. 5) of the false-twist draw-texturing machine 100 can be realized.<br>
Furthermore, as described above, it is completely unnecessary to drive the stocker 10 for attaching a new empty winding tube 3 to the cradle 40, and an empty winding tube 3 can be received from the stocker 10 only by rotatively moving the pair of the cradle arms 4. In other words, the pair of the cradle arms 4 commonly performs the function for receiving an empty winding tube 3. Therefore, the construction of the stocker 10 can be simplified, and the number of parts necessary for the automatic doffing device can be reduced.<br>
Preferably, stop means for properly stopping the movement of the drive cam 7a is provided in the cradle lifting part 7. The stop means may be a disk brake, drumbrake, or one-way clutch. Thereby, when the full winding package 3b rolls to the ejecting<br>
 <br>
36<br>
concave portions 8, the weight of the full winding package 3b can be received and preferable inclinations of the rolling guide surfaces 9 can be kept until the rolling is securely completed. Or, as shown in Fig. 3, when the pair of the bobbin holders 4a sandwich the empty winding tube 3, the positions of the pair of the bobbin holders 4a can be kept until the sandwiching is securely completed.<br>
In this embodiment, the joint portion 4c is provided closer to the opposite-passage side than the pair of the bobbin holders 4a, however, without limiting to this, it is also possible that the joint portion is provided between the pair of the bobbin holders 4a and the centers of rotative movement 4b, or provided closer to the work passage 120 side than the centers of rotative movement 4b.<br>
