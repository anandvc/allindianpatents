TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains generally to signal analysis and synthesis filter banks<br>
such as those that may be used in audio and video coding systems. More particularly, the<br>
present invention pertains to analysis and synthesis filter banks implemented by a cascade<br>
of block transforms that are able to adapt the time and frequency resolutions of the filter<br>
banks.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Coding systems are often used to reduce the amount of information required to<br>
adequately represent a source signal. By reducing information capacity requirements, a<br>
signal representation can be transmitted over channels having lower bandwidth or stored<br>
on media using less space. Coding can reduce the information capacity requirements of a<br>
source signal by removing either redundant components or irrelevant components in the<br>
signal. So called perceptual coding methods and systems often use filter banks to reduce<br>
redundancy by decorrelating a source signal using a basis set of spectral components, and<br>
reduce irrelevancy by adaptive quantization of the spectral components according to<br>
psycho-perceptual criteria.<br>
Many perceptual coding systems implement the filter banks by block transforms.<br>
In an audio coding system, for example, a source audio signal, which is represented by<br>
time segments or blocks of time-domain samples, is transformed into sets of frequency-<br>
domain coefficients representing the spectral content of the source signal. The length of<br>
the segments establishes both the time resolution and the frequency resolution of the filter<br>
bank. Time resolution increases as the segment length decreases. Frequency resolution<br>
increases as the segment length increases. Because of this relationship, the choice of<br>
segment length imposes a trade off between the time and frequency resolution of a block<br>
transform filter bank.	1<br>
No single choice of segment length can provide an optimum trade off between<br>
resolutions for all of the source signal conditions that are encountered by typical coding<br>
systems. Slowly varying or stationary source signals generally can be encoded more<br>
efficiently if the filter bank has a higher frequency resolution, which can be provided if a<br><br>
longer segment length is used. Rapidly varying or highly non-stationary source signals<br>
generally can be encoded more efficiently if the filter bank has a higher time resolution,<br>
which can be provided if a shorter segment length is used. By adapting the segment<br>
length in response to changing source signal conditions, a block transform filter bank can<br>
optimize the tradeoff between its time and frequency resolution.<br>
A large variety of transforms may be used to implement filter banks in audio<br>
coding systems, for example, but a particular Modified Discrete Cosine Transform<br>
(MDCT) is widely used because it has several very attractive properties for audio coding<br>
including the ability to provide critical sampling while allowing adjacent source signal<br>
segments to overlap one another. The MDCT is also attractive because it is able to<br>
remove substantially all redundant components in a source signal that is substantially<br>
stationary within a segment. Proper operation of the MDCT filter bank requires the use of<br>
overlapped source-signal segments and window functions that satisfy certain criteria<br>
described in Princen et al., "Subband/Transform Coding Using Filter Bank Designs Based<br>
on Time Domain Aliasing Cancellation," Proc. of the 1987 International Conference on<br>
Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), May 1987, pp. 2161-64.<br>
Unfortunately, it is difficult to adapt the time and frequency resolution of MDCT filter<br>
banks in response to signal conditions because of the requirements imposed on the<br>
window functions that must be applied to overlapping source signal segments.<br>
One known technique sometimes referred to as "window switching" is able to<br>
adapt the time resolution of a MDCT filter bank by adaptively switching between two<br>
different window functions in response to the detection of certain signal conditions such<br>
as abrupt signal changes or amplitude transients. According to this technique, which is<br>
described in U.S. patent 5,214,742 by Edler, issued May 25, 1993, segment lengths are<br>
not changed but the time resolution is adapted by switching between different window<br>
function shapes to reduce the number of non-zero samples in each segment that are<br>
transformed by the filter bank. Unfortunately, this technique does not adapt the frequency<br>
resolution of the filter bank and the frequency selectivity of the filter bank is seriously<br>
degraded whenever the time resolution is reduced because the shape of the window<br>
functions needed for window switching must be suboptimal to satisfy the requirements<br>
for proper operation of the MDCT.<br>
Another known technique sometimes referred to as "block switching" is similar to<br>
the window-switching technique mentioned above in that it also switches between<br><br>
different window function shapes, but the block-switching technique is able to adapt both<br>
time and frequency resolutions of a MDCT filter bank by also adaptively switching<br>
between two different segment lengths in response to the detection of certain signal<br>
conditions such as abrupt signal changes or amplitude transients. This technique is used in<br>
the Advanced Audio Coder (AAC), which is described in Bosi et al., "ISO/TEC MPEG-2<br>
Advanced Audio Coding," J. Audio Eng. Soc, vol. 45, no. 10, October 1997, pp.789-814.<br>
In AAC, a MDCT filter bank is applied to stationary source signal segments<br>
having a length equal to 2048 samples and is applied to non-stationary source signal<br>
segments having a length equal to 256 samples. Block switching is achieved in AAC by<br>
using "long window functions" that are appropriate for the longer segments, "short<br>
window functions" that are appropriate for the shorter segments, a "long-to-short bridging<br>
window function" that allows switching from the longer segment length to the shorter<br>
segment length, and a "short-to-long bridging window function" that allows switching<br>
from the shorter segment length to the longer segment length. The two bridging window<br>
functions allow switching between different segment length while satisfying the criteria<br>
necessary for proper operation of the MDCT. A switch from a longer segment length to a<br>
shorter segment length and back to the longer length is accomplished by applying the<br>
MDCT to a long segment using the long-to-short bridging window function, applying the<br>
MDCT to an integer multiple of eight short segments using the short window function,<br>
and applying the MDCT to a long segment using the short-to-long bridging window<br>
function. Immediately thereafter, the MDCT must be applied to a long segment but the<br>
long window function may be used or the long-to-short bridging window function may be<br>
used if another block switch is desired.<br>
Although block switching does provide a way to adapt the time and frequency<br>
resolution of a MDCT filter bank, it is not an ideal solution for several reasons. One<br>
reason is that the frequency selectivity of the transform is degraded during a switch of<br>
block lengths because the shape of the bridge window functions must be suboptimal to<br>
allow segment-length switching and to satisfy requirements for proper operation of the<br>
MDCT. Another reason is that a switch cannot occur at any arbitrary time. As explained<br>
above, the MDCT must be applied to another long segment immediately after switching<br>
to the longer segment length. An immediate switch to the shorter length is not possible.<br>
This block switching technique also is not an ideal solution because the switching<br>
mechanism provides only two segment lengths, which are not optimum for all signal<br><br>
conditions. For example, the two segment lengths in AAC are not optimal because neither<br>
the longer nor the shorter segment length in AAC is optimum for most speech signal<br>
segments. The 2048-sample segments are usually too long for the non-stationary nature of<br>
speech and the 256-sample segments are usually too short to remove redundant<br>
components effectively. Furthermore, there are many stationary signals for which a<br>
segment length longer than 2048 samples would be more optimum. As a result, the<br>
performance of AAC is impaired by the limited ability of block switching to adapt the<br>
time and frequency resolution of a MDCT filter bank.<br>
Another form of block switching is used in coding systems that conform to the<br>
Dolby Digital encoded bit stream standard. This coding standard, sometimes referred to<br>
as AC-3, is described in the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) A/52A<br>
document entitled "Revision A to Digital Audio Compression (AC-3) Standard"<br>
published August 20, 2001. The form of block switching used in AC-3 coding systems<br>
applies a MDCT to source signal segments of either 512 samples for stationary signals or<br>
256 samples for non-stationary signals. The block switching technique used in AC-3<br>
coding systems provides more flexibility in choosing when length switches are made.<br>
Furthermore, coding performance is reasonably good for non-stationary source signals<br>
like speech; however, the coding performance for signals that are more stationary is<br>
limited by the relatively low frequency resolution provided by the longer segment.<br>
Other techniques for adaptive control of the time and frequency resolution of a<br>
MDCT filter bank are described in U.S. patent 5,394,473 by Davidson, which issued<br>
February 28, 1995. Some of these techniques allow a MDCT filter bank to be applied to<br>
segments of essentially any length using window functions that provide much a better<br>
frequency response than is possible by other known techniques. Unfortunately, these<br>
techniques must adapt the kernel or basis functions of the MDCT and are, therefore,<br>
incompatible with existing bit stream standards like the AC-3 standard mentioned above.<br>
These techniques are also computationally intensive.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
What is needed is a more efficient and effective way to adapt the frequency<br>
resolution of filter banks implemented by transforms like the MDCT. Preferably, the<br>
solution should provide an implementation that simplifies its incorporation into systems<br>
that are compatible with existing bit stream standards. This is achieved by using a hybrid-<br>
 transform filter bank that may be implemented by a cascade of block transforms.<br><br>
According to teachings of the present invention, analysis and synthesis filter banks<br>
are implemented by hybrid transforms that comprise a primary transform in cascade with<br>
one or more secondary transforms. In one implementation, the primary transform is a<br>
MDCT that is applied to source signal segments overlapping one another by one-half the<br>
segment length and the secondary transform is a DCT that is applied to non-overlapping<br>
blocks of MDCT coefficients for a particular frequency across time. The frequency<br>
resolution of the filter banks may be increased by increasing the number of coefficients in<br>
the blocks that are transformed by the one or more secondary transforms. The one or<br>
more secondary transforms may be applied to blocks of MDCT coefficients having a<br>
number of coefficients that varies with coefficient frequency, thereby allowing the<br>
frequency resolution of the filter bank to be adapted in a wide variety of ways.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A. Introduction<br>
The present invention provides a filter bank that is implemented by a hybrid<br>
transform whose frequency resolution can be easily adapted. Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate<br>
schematic block diagrams of a transmitter and receiver, respectively, in an audio coding<br>
system that may incorporate various aspects of the present invention. Features of the<br>
illustrated transmitter and receiver are discussed briefly in the following sections.<br><br>
Following this discussion, pertinent features of analysis and synthesis filter banks are<br>
discussed.<br>
1. Transmitter<br>
The transmitter illustrated in Fig. 1 applies the analysis filter bank 3 to a source<br>
signal received from the path 1 to generate spectral coefficients that represent the spectral<br>
content of the source signal, applies the encoder 5 to the spectral coefficients to generate<br>
encoded information, and applies the formatter 8 to the encoded information to generate<br>
an output signal suitable for transmission along the path 9. The output signal may be<br>
delivered immediately to a receiver or recorded for subsequent delivery. The analysis<br>
filter bank 3 may be implemented in variety of ways as described below.<br>
In this disclosure, terms like "encoder" and "encoding" are not intended to imply<br>
any particular type of information processing. For example, encoding is often used to<br>
reduce information capacity requirements; however, these terms in this disclosure do not<br>
necessarily refer to this type of processing. The encoder 5 may perform essentially any<br>
type of processing that is desired. In one implementation, encoded information is<br>
generated by quantizing spectral coefficients according to a perceptual model using a<br>
wide variety of quantization techniques including vector quantization and gain-adaptive<br>
quantization described in U.S. patent 6,246,345 by Davidson et al., which issued June 12,<br>
2001. No particular type of encoding is important to the present invention.<br>
2. Receiver<br>
The receiver illustrated in Fig. 2 applies the deformatter 23 to an input signal<br>
received from the path 21 to obtain encoded information, applies the decoder 25 to the<br>
encoded information to obtain spectral coefficients representing the spectral content of a<br>
source signal, and applies the synthesis filter bank 27 to the spectral coefficients to<br>
generate an output signal along the path 29 that is a replica of the source signal but may<br>
not be an exact replica. The synthesis filter bank 27 may be implemented in a variety of<br>
ways that are complementary to the implementation of the analysis filter bank 3.<br>
In this disclosure, terms like "decoder" and "decoding" are not intended to imply<br>
any particular type of information processing. The decoder 25 may perform essentially<br>
any type of processing that is needed or desired. In one implementation that is inverse to<br>
an encoding process described above, quantized spectral components are decoded into<br>
dequantized spectral coefficients. No particular type of decoding is important to the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
B. Adaptive Hybrid Transform<br>
The analysis filter bank 3 and the synthesis filter bank 27 comprise hybrid<br>
transforms, which may be implemented as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.<br>
The analysis filter bank 3 shown in Fig. 4 comprises a primary transform 43 and<br>
one or more secondary transforms 45 in cascade with the primary transform. The primary<br>
transform is applied to segments of a source signal to generate sets of spectral coefficients<br>
that represent the spectral content of the source signal segments. Each of the one or more<br>
secondary transforms is applied to blocks of spectral coefficients for a particular<br>
frequency across time. The number of coefficients in each block is adapted in response to<br>
a control signal.<br>
The synthesis filter bank 27 shown in Fig. 5 comprises one or more inverse<br>
secondary transforms 52 and an inverse primary transform 54 in cascade with the inverse<br>
secondary transforms. Each of the one or more inverse secondary transforms generates<br>
blocks of spectral coefficients for a particular frequency across time. The number of<br>
coefficients in each block is adapted in response to a control signal. The blocks of spectral<br>
coefficients are assembled into sets of spectral coefficients for a particular time across<br>
frequency and the primary transform is applied to the sets of spectral coefficients to<br>
generate segments of a signal that are combined to provide a replica of an original source<br>
signal.<br>
The primary transforms for the analysis filter bank and the synthesis filter bank<br>
implement an analysis/synthesis system in which an inverse primary transform cancels<br>
time-domain aliasing artifacts that are generated by the forward primary transform. For<br>
example, the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and the Inverse MDCT<br>
(IMDCT) described in the Princen paper mentioned above implement the time-domain<br>
equivalent of an oddly-stacked critically sampled single-sideband analysis/synthesis<br>
system. These transforms are referred to herein as Oddly-Stacked Time-Domain Aliasing<br>
Cancellation (O-TDAC) transforms. Another TDAC implementation is described in<br>
Princen et al., "Analysis/Synthesis Filter Bank Design Based on Time Domain Aliasing<br>
Cancellation," IEEE Trans, on Acoust.. Speech. Signal Proa, vol. ASSP-34, 1986, pp.<br>
1153-1161. The analysis filter bank in this implementation comprises an application of a<br>
MDCT and a Modified Discrete Sine Transform (MDST) to alternate signal segments. The<br>
synthesis filter bank comprises an application of an IMDCT and an Inverse MDST<br>
(TMDST). These transforms implement the time-domain equivalent of an evenly-stacked<br><br>
critically sampled single-sideband analysis/synthesis system and are referred to as Evenly-<br>
Stacked Time-Domain Aliasing Cancellation transforms.<br>
The secondary transforms may be implemented by any of a number of transforms<br>
including the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), and<br>
. the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).<br>
In a preferred implementation of the analysis filter bank 3, a type-II DCT is used<br>
in cascade with the O-TDAC MDCT mentioned above. In a counterpart implementation<br>
of the synthesis filter bank 27, the O-TDAC IMDCT is used in cascade with a type-II<br>
Inverse DCT (IDCT). These implementations are discussed in more detail below.<br>
1. Analysis Filter Bank<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a sequence of source signal samples are received from the path<br>
1 and stored in the buffer 41. The analyzer 47 is an optional component that determines<br>
the number of source signal samples in each segment, or segment length, to use for<br>
subsequent processing by applying some analytical process to the stored samples.<br>
Essentially any analytical process may be used as desired. For example, amplitude<br>
transients may be detected as described in the ATSC A/52A document cited above.<br>
Information representing chosen segment lengths is passed along the path 2 to the<br>
formatter 7 for inclusion in the output signal. Fixed length segments are used in an<br>
alternative implementation that omits the analyzer 47 and the path 2.<br>
a) Analysis Window Function<br>
The window 42 forms a sequence of overlapping segments by weighting the<br>
source signal samples in each segment with an analysis window function. The length and<br>
shape of the analysis window function for each segment is adapted in response to the<br>
segment length information received from the path 2. A wide variety of window functions<br>
may be used but aKaiser-Bessel-Derived (KBD) window function is generally preferred<br>
because it has excellent frequency selectivity properties. This window function is derived<br>
from a Kaiser-Besset window function that may be expressed as:<br><br><br><br>
An alpha value in the range from 4 to 7 works well for typical audio coding applications.<br>
The derivation convolves the Kaiser-Bessel window function W{n) with a<br>
rectangular window function having a length equal to the desired window function length N<br>
minus an overlap interval v. See expression 2. This convolution may be simplified as shown<br>
in expression 3.<br><br>
The KBD analysis window function may be obtained by taking the square root of<br>
the derived product-window WP(n). This analysis window function is shown in expression<br>
The primary transform 43 transforms each segment of windowed source signal<br>
samples into a set of spectral coefficients. Each coefficient in a set of coefficients<br>
represents the spectral content of a windowed segment for a particular frequency. The<br><br><br>
The primary transform may be implemented directly according to expression 5 or<br>
it may be implemented by processes that are computationally more efficient such as those<br>
using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) described in U.S. patent 5,394,473. The analysis<br>
window function and the primary transform may be adapted in response to segment<br>
length using essentially any process that may be desired. A few techniques are disclosed<br>
in U.S. patent 5,214,742, U.S. patent 5,394,473, the ATSC A/52A document, and the<br>
ISO/MPEG AAC document cited above.<br>
Spectral coefficients representing the spectral content of the windowed source<br>
signal segments for each of one or more respective frequencies are passed along<br>
respective signal paths and stored in buffers. The transmitter shown in Fig. 4, for<br>
example, passes spectral coefficients for each of two respective frequencies along one of<br>
two signal paths for storage in the buffers 44a and 44b. Only two signal processing paths<br>
are shown in Fig. 4 for illustrative clarity. Implementations of the analysis filter bank 3<br>
for use in typical systems could have hundreds of paths.<br><br>
Referring to the upper signal path shown in Fig. 4, spectral coefficients for a<br>
particular frequency in a sequence of segments are stored in the buffer 44a and assembled<br>
into blocks. The analyzer 48a determines the number of coefficients in each block, which<br>
is the block length, and passes this length along the path 49a. This length may be<br>
determined by analyzing the coefficients that are stored in the buffer 44a. No particular<br>
method of analysis is critical in principle to the present invention. A few analytical<br>
methods are described here.<br>
One basic method forms the longest possible blocks of spectral coefficients in<br>
which the coefficients in a respective block are sufficiently similar in magnitude. This<br>
may be determined in a variety of ways. One way calculates differences in magnitude<br>
between adjacent spectral coefficients and identifies the longest block of adjacent<br>
coefficients in which the average difference is less than some threshold. Another way<br>
uses spectral coefficients that are stored in buffers for multiple signal paths. This<br>
approach sums the magnitude differences for a band of spectral coefficients and identifies<br>
the longest block in which the average difference across the band is less than some<br>
threshold. The width of the band may be commensurate with the so called critical<br>
bandwidths of the human auditory system.<br>
Another basic method relies on signal analysis that is performed by signal<br>
encoding processes performed elsewhere in a transmitter. A transmitter that is compatible<br>
with the bit stream standard described in the A/52A document cited above, for example,<br>
generates an encoded signal with spectral coefficients represented as scaled values that<br>
are associated with scale factors. The scale factors are analyzed to identify sequences of<br>
MDCT coefficient sets that can share a common set of scale factors. The analyzer 48a<br>
adapts the block length for its respective signal path to equal the number of coefficient<br>
sets that share exponents.<br>
d) Secondary Transform<br>
The secondary transform 45a transforms each block of spectral coefficients into a<br>
set of hybrid-transform coefficients. The length of the transform is adapted in response to<br>
the block length information received from the path 49a. In a preferred implementation, a<br>
type IIDCT is applied to blocks of spectral coefficients that do not overlap one another.<br>
This transform may be expressed as:<br><br><br>
The secondary transform may be implemented directly according to expression 7<br>
or it may be implemented by known processes that are computationally more efficient<br>
such as those described in chapter 4 of Rao et al., "Discrete Cosine Transform,"<br>
Academic Press, Inc., 1990.<br>
e) Formatter and Other Signal Paths<br>
The formatter 46a is an optional component that may be used to assemble the<br>
hybrid-transform coefficients and block length information into data that the encoder 5<br>
and the formatter 7 can process. This allows the analysis filter bank 3 in the transmitter<br>
shown in Fig. 1 to be implemented by a hybrid transform with minimal changes to the<br>
rest of the transmitter.<br>
The buffer 44b, the analyzer 48b, the secondary transform 45b, and the formatter<br>
46b perform processes in the lower signal path that are analogous to those discussed<br>
above for the respective components in the upper signal path.<br>
J) Encoding<br>
In typical systems, the encoder 5 generates encoded information that represents<br>
the hybrid-transform coefficients in some encoded form. If perceptual encoding processes<br>
are used, the hybrid-transform coefficients are encoded into a form that reduces<br>
perceptual irrelevancy. Perceptual encoding processes usually cause spectral information<br>
to be lost that cannot be recovered or recreated by the receiver. The possibility of this loss<br>
is represented below by the symbol X(k,j), which denotes a possible modification to the<br>
hybrid-transform coefficients generated by the hybrid transform. The use of such<br>
encoding processes are not critical to the present invention.<br>
2. Synthesis Filter Bank<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the deformatters 51a and 51b obtain hybrid transform<br>
coefficients and block length information from data that is received from the paths 26a<br>
and 26b, respectively. The block length information is passed along the paths 59a and<br><br>
59b, and the hybrid-transform coefficients are passed to the inverse secondary transforms<br>
52a and 52b. Only two signal processing paths are shown in Fig. 5 for illustrative clarity.<br>
Implementations of the synthesis filter bank 27 for use in typical systems could have<br>
hundreds of paths.<br>
The deformatter 51b, the inverse secondary transform 52b, and the buffer 53b<br>
perform processes in the lower signal path that are analogous to those discussed below for<br>
the respective components in the upper signal path.<br>
a) Deformatter<br>
Referring to the upper signal path shown in Fig. 5, the deformatter 51a is an<br>
optional component that may be used to disassemble sets of hybrid-transform coefficients<br>
and block length information from data that is received from the deformatter 23 and the<br>
decoder 25. This allows a hybrid-transform implementation of the synthesis filter bank 27<br>
to be incorporated into an existing receiver as shown in Fig. 2 with minimal changes to<br>
the rest of the receiver.<br>
b) Inverse Secondary Transform<br>
The inverse secondary transform 52a transforms a set of hybrid-transform<br>
coefficients into a block of spectral coefficients that represent the spectral content for a<br>
particular frequency of a sequence of source signal segments. The block of spectral<br>
coefficients are stored in the buffer 53a. The length of the transform is adapted in<br>
response to the block length information received from the path 59a. In a preferred<br>
implementation, a type IIIDCT is applied to blocks of spectral coefficients that do not<br>
overlap one another. This transform may be expressed as:<br><br>
The inverse secondary transform may be implemented directly according to<br>
expression 8 or it may be implemented by known processes that are computationally<br>
more efficient.<br>
c) Inverse Primary Transform<br>
i	The buffers 53a and 53b Store spectral coefficients and pass them to the inverse<br>
primary transform 54 in such a way that the inverse primary transform receives sets of<br><br>
spectral coefficients that represent the spectral content of respective source signal<br>
segments. Segments of signal samples are generated by applying an inverse transform to<br>
the sets of spectral coefficients and stored in the buffer 55. The length of the inverse<br>
primary transform is adapted in response to segment length information received from the<br>
; path 22. The O-TDAC TMDCT is used in a preferred implementation.<br>
In typical applications, half of the MDCT coefficients are discarded in the<br>
transmitter. The discarded coefficients may be recovered by the receiver using the<br>
following expression:<br><br>
where x = recovered signal sample.<br>
The inverse primary transform may be implemented directly according to<br>
expression 10 or it may be implemented by known processes that are computationally<br>
more efficient such as those using the FFT described in U.S. patent 5,394,473.<br>
(I) Synthesis Window Function<br>
The window 56 generates an output signal along the path 29 by weighting the<br>
segments of signal samples that are stored in the buffer 55 with a synthesis window<br>
function and adding the weighted samples in overlapping segments to one another in the<br>
overlapping portions. The inverse primary transform, synthesis window function and the<br>
overlap-add process cancel at least a substantial portion of the time-domain aliasing<br>
artifacts that were generated by the forward transform. Cancellation may not be exact<br>
because of modifications to the transform coefficients that were caused by encoding<br>
processes and by finite arithmetic precision in the calculations of the primary and<br>
secondary transforms. The length and shape of the synthesis window function for each<br>
segment is adapted in response to the segment length information received from the path<br>
22. A KBD window function that is equal to the analysis window function WA show<br>
above in expression 4 is used in a preferred implementation.<br><br>
The synthesis window function and the inverse primary transform may be adapted<br>
in response to the segment length information using processes such as those referred to<br>
above.<br>

ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br><br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING AN OUTPUT SIGNAL<br>
Analysis and synthesis filter banks (3) such as those used in audio and video coding<br>
systems are each implemented by a hybrid transform that comprises a primary transform (43) in<br>
cascade with one or more secondary transforms (45a, 45b). The primary transforms for the filter<br>
banks implement an analysis/synthesis system in which time-domain aliasing artifacts are<br>
cancelled. The secondary transforms (45a, 45b), which are in cascade with the primary<br>
transforms (43), are applied to blocks of transform coefficients. The length of the blocks is<br>
varied to adapt the time resolution of the analysis and synthesis filter banks.</td>
