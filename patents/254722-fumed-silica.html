				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Fumed silica<br>
The invention relates to fumed silica, to a process for<br>
preparing it and to its use.<br>
Fumed silica (pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide)<br>
is known from Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen<br>
Chemie, Volume 21, page 4 64 (1982).<br>
It is prepared by burning a vaporizable silicon<br>
compound, such as silicon tetrachloride, for example,<br>
in a mixture with hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
The comminution of materials to form coarse powders<br>
(50-500 µm) , fine powders (5-50 µm) and even greater<br>
finenesses (less than 5 µm) is common and widespread<br>
practice. For all . comminution tasks there is a<br>
multiplicity of technical and industrial equipment<br>
offered and operated, all adapted to the particular<br>
circumstances of the specific tasks. A good overview of<br>
the comminution problems and of the diverse machines is<br>
given in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie,<br>
3rd Edition, Volume 1, pages 616 to 638. For fumed<br>
silica the average primary particle diameters are<br>
notably lower (5-50 nm) than can be obtained by<br>
mechanical comminution.<br>
The primary particles and aggregates of the fumed<br>
silica with a surface area of 200 m2/g can be<br>
visualized in the electron microscope.<br>
The primary particles and aggregates of a fumed silica<br>
agglomerate to form larger assemblies whose size is<br>
generally in inverse proportion to the primary particle<br>
size or in proportion to the specific surface area. The<br>
agglomerate size also increases in line with the extent<br>
to which the fumed silica is compacted.<br><br>
The binding forces holding these agglomerates together<br>
are relatively weak. Nevertheless, when these agglome-<br>
rates are incorporated into and broken down in a liquid<br>
system for the purpose of homogeneous distribution of<br>
the primary particles and aggregates, or particles with<br>
a low degree of agglomeration, a certain shearing<br>
energy is required. Depending on the particular field<br>
of application, dispersing is carried out using any of<br>
a very wide variety of mixing devices, with determining<br>
factors for the selection being not only the viscosity<br>
and polarity of the system but also the agglomerate<br>
strength and the desired homogeneity.<br>
With simple agitator mechanisms, such as paddle<br>
stirrers, it is usually not possible to carry out to<br>
satisfaction the direct incorporation of small amounts<br>
of silicas, especially not when the systems in question<br>
are of low viscosity. However, paint and varnish<br>
makers, and also those who carry out processing, have<br>
an interest in obtaining performance-optimum distribu-<br>
tion of the silicas, which are used predominantly as<br>
thickeners and thixotropic agents, by means of very<br>
simple devices, with a very low energy input and in a<br>
very short time.<br>
In the case of paddle-stirrer dispersing, the coarse<br>
silica agglomerates are not sufficiently comminuted and<br>
hence are able to make only a small contribution to<br>
raising viscosities and thixotropy. The data relate to<br>
a UP resin (unsaturated polyester resin) as dispersion<br>
medium.<br>
Reducing the agglomerate size by dispersing outside a<br>
liquid system, in other words, in practice, in the air,<br>
or by grinding in the conventional sense, is possible<br>
only to a limited extent, since in the case of material<br>
with a given propensity to agglomerate the comminution<br>
is followed immediately by the re-establishment of the<br><br>
old agglomeration state. This effect comes about no<br>
later than after recompaction of the material which as<br>
a result of the mechanical intervention has undergone a<br>
high degree of loosening and which in this form is not<br>
amenable to dispatch and storage. The storage time as<br>
well would have the effect of renewed agglomerate<br>
enlargement.<br>
A value taken as a dimensional number and evaluation<br>
variable for the stage of distribution of a dispersible<br>
silica and maximum agglomerate size of the dispersion<br>
(granularity) is the so-called grindometer value to DIN<br>
53203.<br>
A known procedure is to render fumed silica hydro-<br>
phobic, to grind it in a pinned-disc mill and then to<br>
classify it (US 2004/0110077 A1) . This known silica is<br>
used as an external additive in toner mixtures.<br>
Hydrophilic fumed silica with a BET surface area<br>
possesses a grindometer value as determined in UP resin<br>
(unsaturated polyester resin Ludepal P6 from BASF, 2%<br>
dispersion) in accordance with the DIN specification,<br>
of 50 to 60.<br>
If this fumed silica is also relatively highly com-<br>
pacted (100 to 120 g/l), the grindometer value as well<br>
is also significantly higher, specifically more than<br>
100, whereby necessitating an additional, not<br>
inconsiderable energy as a thickener and thixotropic<br>
agent.<br>
A known procedure is to grind a highly dispersed silica<br>
having a surface area of approximately 300 m2/g in a<br>
pinned-disc mill.<br>
The grindometer value achieved is initially, for the<br>
uncompacted silica, 25.<br><br>
If this silica is compacted to 50 g/l, the grindometer<br>
value rises to 30, and in the case of further compac-<br>
tion to 75 g/l it rises to as far as about 40.<br>
In the case of storage over a period of three months,<br>
the ground silica, not modified but compacted to<br>
50 g/l, has a grindometer value of 50 to 60.<br>
Reagglomeration can only be prevented in accordance<br>
with the prior art if the hydrophilic silica is mixed<br>
with 3% by weight of a hydrophobic silica and if this<br>
mixture is ground by means of an air-jet mill or a<br>
pinned-disc mill (EP 0 076 377 B1).<br>
In this case, for a fumed silica having a BET surface<br>
area of 200 m2/g, even after compaction to 73 or<br>
107 g/l, a grindometer value of 35 is achieved.<br>
For a fumed silica having a BET surface area of<br>
300 m2/g, the addition of hydrophobic silica prior to<br>
grinding produces a grindometer value of 10 for a<br>
tamped density of 28.1 g/l and of 15 to 20 for a tamped<br>
density of 50 g/l.<br>
The known fumed silicas have the disadvantage that they<br>
contain an unwanted fraction of hydrophobic silica.<br>
The invention provides	a fumed silica which is<br>
characterized in that it	has the following physico-<br>
chemical data:<br>
BET surface area	200 ± 15 m2/g<br>
Grindometer value	less than 30 µm<br>
Median value	PCS 65 to 85 nm<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing<br>
the silica of the invention which is characterized in<br>
that a fumed silica having a BET surface area of 200 ±<br>
25 m2/g is ground.<br><br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
grinding can take place by means of a pinned-disc mill<br>
or an air-jet mill.<br>
The fumed silica can have an average primary particle<br>
size of 12 nm ± 5 nm, preferably 12 nm.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention a fumed silica<br>
can be used which has a tamped density of approximately<br>
50 ± 10 g/l, preferably 50 m2/g.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the invention a fumed<br>
silica can be used which has the following physico-<br>
chemical data:<br><br>
1)	To DIN ISO 9277<br>
2)	To DIN EN ISO 787-11, JIS K 5101/20 (unsieved)<br>
3)	To DIN EN ISO 787-2, ASTM D 280, JIS K 5101/23<br>
4)	To DIN EN 3262-20, ASTM D 1208, JIS K 5101/24<br>
5)	Based on the substance dried at 105°C for 2 hours<br><br>
6)	To DIN EN ISO 787-9, ASTM D 1208, JIS K 5101/26<br>
7)	Based on the substance calcined at 1000°C for 2<br>
hours<br>
8)	HC1 content in constituent from loss on ignition<br>
The Aerosil® 200 silica used in accordance with the<br>
invention, with a BET surface area, differs from the<br>
known Aerosil® 300, which has a surface area of<br>
300 m2/g, not only in the surface size but also in the<br>
average primary particle size. The Aerosil® 300 has an<br>
average primary particle size of 7 nm. On the basis of<br>
these differences these silicas have different<br>
performance properties.<br>
The fumed silica of the invention contains no hydro-<br>
phobic fractions. In spite of this the silica of the<br>
invention shows no propensity to reagglomerate. The<br>
grindometer value is below 30.<br>
The fumed silica of the invention can be used as a<br>
filler in silicone rubber compounds.<br>
Silicone rubber compounds and the use of fumed silica<br>
(AEROSIL®) in silicone rubber compounds are known<br>
(Ullmann's Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry,<br>
Volume A 23, Rubber, 1, 221 ff.; Rubber 3, 3,6 ff.;<br>
Volume A 24, Silicones 57 ff. 1993).<br>
Fumed silica is used on account of its excellent<br>
thickening effect (thixotroping) in silicone sealants,<br>
this thickening effect being desirable in the context<br>
of use as a jointing compound.<br>
Where, however, the silicone rubber compounds are to be<br>
used as coating materials, a low level of thickening is<br>
desired (US 6,268,300).<br>
Of decisive importance in both cases is the optical<br><br>
quality of the surface of the silicone vulcanizates.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to<br>
provide silicone rubber compounds which through the use<br>
of fumed silica as filler exhibit an optically high-<br>
grade surface after vulcanization.<br>
The invention provides silicone rubber compounds<br>
containing 0.5% to 60% by weight, based on the total<br>
mass, of the fumed silica of the invention having the<br>
following characteristic physicochemical data:<br>
BET surface area	200 ± 15 m2/g<br>
Grindometer value	less than 30<br>
Median value by PCS 65 to 85 nm<br>
and<br>
40% to 99.5% by weight, based on the total mass, of an<br>
organopolysiloxane of the formula<br><br>
where R = alkenyl, alkoxy, aryl, oxime, acetoxy, alkyl<br>
radicals, having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by 0, S, F, Cl, Br, I, in each case<br>
identical or different, and/or polystyrene, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate and polyacrylo-<br>
nitrile radicals having 40-10 000 repeater units.<br>
Z = OH, Cl, Br, acetoxy, amino, amineoxy, oxime,<br>
alkoxyamido, alkenyloxy, acryloxy or phosphate<br>
radicals, it being possible for the organic radicals to<br>
carry up to 20 carbon atoms, and in each case identical<br>
or different.<br>
Z' = oxime, alkoxy, acetoxy, amino, amido,<br>
n = 1-3<br>
x = 100-15 000.<br><br>
As organopolysiloxane it is possible to use all poly-<br>
siloxanes which have or have been able to be used to<br>
date as a basis for room-temperature-crosslinking<br>
(room-temperature-vulcanizing) (RTV) compositions. They<br>
may be described for example by the general formula<br><br>
where x, R, Z' and Z have the following definitions:<br>
where R = alkenyl, alkoxy, aryl, oxime, acetoxy, alkyl<br>
radicals, having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by 0, S, F, Cl, Br, I, in each case<br>
identical or different, and/or polystyrene, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate and polyacrylo-<br>
nitrile radicals having 40-10 000 repeater units.<br>
Z = OH, Cl, Br, acetoxy, amino, amineoxy, oxime,<br>
alkoxyamido, alkenyloxy, acryloxy or phosphate<br>
radicals, it being possible for the organic radicals to<br>
carry up to 20 carbon atoms, and in each case identical<br>
or different.<br>
Z' = oxime, alkoxy, acetoxy, amino, amido,<br>
n = 1-3<br>
x = 100-15 000.<br>
Within and/or along the siloxane chain in the formula<br>
indicated above it is also possible for there to be<br>
other siloxane units present, usually only as impuri-<br>
ties, in the form of diorganosiloxane units, for<br>
example those of the formula RSiO3/2, R3O1/2 and SiO4/2, R<br>
in each case having the definition indicated for it<br>
above. The amount of these other siloxane units ought<br>
not to exceed 10 mol per cent.<br>
Examples of R with the definition alkyl radical are,<br><br>
for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl and octyl<br>
radicals; possible alkenyl radicals are vinyl, allyl,<br>
ethylallyl and butadienyl radicals; and as aryl<br>
radicals it is possible to use phenyl and tolyl<br>
radical.<br>
Examples of substituted hydrocarbon radicals R are in<br>
particular halogenated hydrocarbon radicals such as<br>
3,3,3-trifluoropropyl radical, chlorophenyl and<br>
bromotolyl radical; and cyanoalkyl radicals, such as<br>
the (3-cyanoethyl radical.<br>
Examples of polymers as radical R are polystyrene,<br>
polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate and<br>
polyacrylonitrile radicals which are attached to<br>
silicon via carbon.<br>
On account of the greater ease of access the<br>
predominant fraction of the radicals R is composed of<br>
methyl groups. The other radicals R are, in particular,<br>
vinyl and/or phenyl groups.<br>
Particularly in the case of the presence of formula-<br>
tions which are storable in the absence of water and<br>
which cure to elastomers at room temperature on ingress<br>
of water, Z and Z1 are hydrolysable groups. Examples of<br>
such groups are acetoxy, amino, amineoxy, alkenyloxy<br>
(for example H2C = (CH3CO-) ) , acyloxy and phosphate<br>
groups. Primarily on account of the greater ease of<br>
access, preferred groups Z are acyloxy groups,<br>
especially acetoxy groups. Excellent results, however,<br>
are also achieved using, for example, oxime groups,<br>
such as those of the formula -ON=C (CH3) (C2H5) , as Z.<br>
Examples of hydrolysable atoms Z are halogen and<br>
hydrogen atoms; examples of alkenyl groups Z are, in<br>
particular, vinyl groups.<br>
The viscosity of the organopolysiloxanes used in the<br>
context of the invention ought not to exceed 500 000 cP<br><br>
at 25°C, preferably 150 000 cP at 25°C. Accordingly the<br>
value x ought preferably not to exceed 40 000.<br>
Examples of organopolysiloxanes which can be used are,<br>
for example, the silicone polymers E50 (α, ω-hydroxydi-<br>
methylsiloxypolydimethylsiloxane) or M50 (α, ω-hydroxy-<br>
dimethylsiloxypolydimethylsiloxane) from GE Bayer<br>
Silicones.<br>
Mixtures of different organopolysiloxanes can also be<br>
used.<br>
The mixing of these organopolysiloxanes with the fumed<br>
silica and, where appropriate, with the further<br>
constituents of the formulation of the invention can<br>
take place in any desired known way, for example in<br>
mechanical mixing devices. It is accomplished very<br>
rapidly and easily, irrespective of the sequence in<br>
which the mixing constituents are added.<br>
Preferably the fumed silicas of the invention are used<br>
in amounts of 0.5% to 60% by weight, preferably 3% to<br>
30% by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
compounds which can be cured to elastomers.<br>
If the only reactive terminal units present in the<br>
diorganopolysiloxanes which contain reactive terminal<br>
units are those having Si-bonded hydroxyl groups, then<br>
these diorganopolysiloxanes must be crosslinked. This<br>
can be done in a conventional way by means of the water<br>
present in the air, with the addition where appropriate<br>
of further water, with a crosslinking agent. Here it is<br>
possible for example to use the Silopren crosslinker<br>
3034 from GE Bayer Silicones, the ethyltriacetoxysilane<br>
optionally in the presence of a condensation catalyst<br>
in a known way. Suitable catalysts for all formulations<br>
of the invention are, for example, the Silopren<br>
catalysts DBTA or type 162 dibutyltin diacetate or<br><br>
dilaurate from the same manufacturer.<br>
In one particular variant of the silicone rubber<br>
compounds of the invention it is possible additionally<br>
for there to be 0.5%-20%, preferably 2%-10% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the compound, of a<br>
crosslinker having the formula<br><br>
with R = alkyl, alkoxy, acetoxy, oxime, aryl, alkene<br>
radicals, having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by 0, S, F, Cl, Br, I, in each case<br>
identical or different, and/or polystyrene, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate and polyacrylo-<br>
nitrile radicals having 5-5000 repeater units,<br>
Z1 = OH, Cl, Br, acetoxy, oxime, amino, amineoxy,<br>
alkenyloxy or phosphate radicals, it being possible for<br>
the organic radicals to carry up to 20 carbon atoms, in<br>
each case identical or different, and<br><br>
All weight data relate to the total amount of silicone<br>
rubber compounds.<br>
Examples of silanes of the formula indicated above are<br>
ethyltriacetoxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane, isopro-<br>
pyltriacetoxysilane, isopropoxytriacetoxysilane, vinyl-<br>
triacetoxysilane, methyltrisdiethylaminooxysilane,<br>
methyltris(cyclohexylamino)silane, methyltris(diethyl-<br>
phosphato)silane and methyltris(methylethylketoximo)-<br>
silane.<br>
Of course it is possible for formulations of the inven-<br>
tion to contain, besides organopolysiloxanes, hydro-<br>
phobicized silica, crosslinking agents and crosslinking<br><br>
catalysts, if desired, fillers which are conventionally<br>
used mostly or frequently in compounds which can be<br>
cured to elastomers. Examples of such substances are<br>
fillers having a surface area below 50 m2/g, such as<br>
coarse quartz powder, kaolin, phyllosilicates, clay<br>
minerals, diatomaceous earth, additionally zirconium<br>
silicate and calcium carbonate, and also untreated<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide, organic resins,<br>
such as polyvinyl chloride powders, organopolysiloxane<br>
resins, fibrous fillers, such as asbestos, glass fibres<br>
and organic pigments, soluble dyes, fragrances,<br>
corrosion inhibitors, curing retardants, such as benzo-<br>
triazole, and plasticizers, such as dimethylpoly-<br>
siloxanes end-blocked by trimethylsiloxy groups.<br>
Optionally the RTV 1K [one-component] silicone rubber<br>
compounds of the invention can contain 0.1%-20%,<br>
preferably 0.1%-15%, with particular preference 0.1%-<br>
10% by weight (based on the total amount of the<br>
formulation (of water-binding substances). Suitable<br>
substances for this purpose are, for example,<br>
carboxylic anhydrides, for example acetic anhydride or<br>
maleic anhydride, and/or carbonic esters, such as for<br>
example diethyl carbonate, ethyl carbonate and/or<br>
alkenyloxy compounds and/or ketals, such as dimethyldi-<br>
oxolane, for example. It is possible to use one or more<br>
of these substances.<br>
Additionally the silicone rubber compounds may contain<br>
0.01% to 99.5% by weight of an unfunctionalized<br>
polysiloxane. Here it is possible to use the poly-<br>
siloxanes already specified, provided that they are not<br>
functionalized. One suitable, non-functional poly-<br>
siloxane is, for example, Baysilone oil M1000 (polydi-<br>
methylsiloxane) from GE Bayer Silicones.<br>
Additionally the silicone rubber compounds may contain<br>
0.01% to 6% by weight of organic or inorganic compounds<br><br>
of the metals Pt, Sn, Ti and/or Zn as catalyst and/or<br>
0.01% to 6% by weight of inhibitors and/or 0.01%-6% by<br>
weight of fungicides and/or bactericides and/or 0.01%<br>
to 6% by weight of adhesion promoters (such as, for<br>
example, Silopren adhesion promoter 3001 from GE Bayer<br>
Silicones, with the composition: di-tert-butoxydiace-<br>
toxysilane). As fungicides/bactericides it is possible<br>
for example to use isothiazolinone, Vinycin or benziso-<br>
thiazolinone.<br>
The silicone rubber compounds of the invention can be<br>
used as silicone rubber systems from the group of the<br>
room-temperature-vulcanizing one-component (1K RTV)<br>
silicone rubber sealants and also self-levelling room-<br>
temperature-crosslinking silicone rubber compounds (1K<br>
RTV) .<br>
The silicone rubber compounds can be used as jointing<br>
compounds, window sealants, seals in motor vehicles,<br>
sports equipment and household appliances, heat-<br>
resistant seals, oil-exuding and chemical-resistant<br>
seals, and water-vapour-resistant seals, and seals in<br>
electrical and electronic appliances.<br>
The silicone rubber compounds can be used as coating<br>
materials for textiles, e.g. lace tape (antislip) , and<br>
textile materials, e.g. woven glass fabric or woven<br>
nylon fabric.<br>
The vulcanizates of the silicone rubber compounds of<br>
the invention advantageously have a high-grade surface.<br>
Examples:<br>
I. Preparation of the inventive fumed silica<br>
The inventive examples were produced by metering<br>
commercial AEROSIL® 200 (bagged product) into the mill<br><br>
employed, using a metering balance, and subjecting it<br>
to grinding. The Aerosil® 200 has the physicochemical<br>
properties listed in Table 1.<br><br>
1]	To DIN ISO 9277<br>
2)	To DIN EN ISO 787-11, JIS K 5101/20 (unsieved)<br>
3)	To DIN EN ISO 787-2, ASTM D 280, JIS K 5101/23<br>
4)	To DIN EN 3262-20, ASTM D 1208, JIS K 5101/24<br>
5)	Based on the substance dried at 105°C for 2 hours<br>
61	To DIN EN ISO 787-9, ASTM D 1208, JIS K 5101/26<br>
7)	Based on the substance calcined at 1000°C for 2<br>
hours<br>
8)	HC1 content in constituent from loss on ignition<br>
The experiments were carried out using a pinned-disc<br>
mill (Alpine 160Z, rotor diameter 160 mm) or an air-jet<br>
mill (grinding chamber diameter: 240 mm, grinding<br><br>
chamber height: 35 mm). The individual parameters of<br>
preparation are listed in Table 2.<br>
The ground product was isolated with a hose filter<br>
(filter area: 3.6 m2, filter material: woven nylon<br>
fabric). In further experiments the ground product<br>
obtained was packaged into commercially customary bags<br>
using a commercially customary bagging machine.<br>
In further experiments the bags packed with ground<br>
products were levelled prior to palletization, using a<br>
method routine in the industry and suitable for their<br>
purpose.<br><br><br><br><br>
With virtually the same specific surface areas in the<br>
range from 195 to 202 m2/g, preferably from 198 to<br>
200 m2/g, and unchanged pH values, the silicas of the<br>
invention exhibit lower grindometer values and smaller<br>
median values than the starting silica.<br>
Surprisingly the lower grindometer values and lower<br>
median values are retained in spite of the compaction,<br>
evident through the tamped density, as a result of<br>
bagging or bagging/levelling.<br>
In some cases the tamped densities are in fact above<br>
that of the oxide used. This means that the oxides of<br>
the invention, despite the same or even higher<br>
compaction, exhibit lower grindometer values and lower<br><br>
median values.<br><br><br><br>
The inventive fumed silica can have a D50 (g) (i.e.<br>
median value, weight distribution) of 12 to 14 nm,<br>
preferably of 12.473 to 13.278 nm. The total span of<br>
the particles can be from 5.260 to 34.700 nm,<br>
preferably 5.260 to 22.740 nm.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show that the inventive silica has no<br>
particles in the range greater than 40 nm when the<br>
weight distribution is considered (cf. Figure 4).<br>
The arithmetic mean of the particle diameter, DN, can<br>
be from 11.5 to 13.5 nm for the inventive silica.<br>
The particle diameter averaged over the surface area,<br>
DA, can be 12.5 to 17.2 nm.<br>
The particle diameter averaged over the volume, DV, can<br>
be 13.0 to 21.7 nm.<br>
The median value D50 (A) (number distribution) can be<br>
11.0 to 11.7 nm.<br>
Determination of characteristic physicochemical data<br>
BET surface area<br>
The BET surface area is determined in accordance with<br>
DIN ISO 9277.<br>
Tamped density<br>
The tamped density is determined in accordance with DIN<br>
EN ISO 787-11.<br>
Principles of tamped density determination:<br>
The tamped density (formerly tamped volume) is equal to<br>
the ratio of the mass to the volume of the powder after<br>
tamping in a tamping volumeter under defined condi-<br><br>
tions. According to DIN EN ISO 787-11 the tamped<br>
density is reported in g/cm3. Owing to the very low<br>
tamped density of the oxides, however, we state the<br>
value in g/l. Furthermore, the drying and sieving, and<br>
the repetition of the tamping process, are omitted.<br>
Apparatus for tamped density determination:<br>
Tamping volumeter<br>
Measuring cylinder<br>
Laboratory balance (reading accuracy 0.01 g)<br>
Tamped density determination procedure:<br>
200 ± 10 ml of oxide are introduced into the measuring<br>
cylinder of the tamping volumeter so that there are no<br>
cavities remaining and so that the surface is horizon-<br>
tal.<br>
The mass of the sample introduced is determined to an<br>
accuracy of 0.01 g. The measuring cylinder containing<br>
the sample is inserted into the cylinder holder of the<br>
tamping volumeter and tamped 1250 times.<br>
The volume of the tamped oxide is read off to an<br>
accuracy of 1 ml.<br>
Evaluation of tamped density determination:<br><br>
pH<br>
The pH is determined in 4% aqueous dispersion.<br>
Reagents for pH determination:<br>
Distilled or deionized water, pH &gt; 5.5<br>
Buffer solutions pH 7.00 pH 4.66<br>
Apparatus for pH determination:<br><br>
Laboratory balance (reading accuracy 0.1 g)<br>
Glass beaker, 250 ml<br>
Magnetic stirrer<br>
Magnetic rod, length 4 cm<br>
Combined pH electrode<br>
pH meter<br>
Dispensette, 100 ml<br>
Procedure for determining pH:<br>
The determination takes place in a modification of<br>
DIN/ISO 787/IX.<br>
Calibration: Prior to pH measurement the meter is<br>
calibrated using the buffer solutions. Where two or<br>
more measurements are carried out one after another, a<br>
single calibration is sufficient.<br>
4 g of oxide are mixed in a 250 ml glass beaker with<br>
96 g (96 ml) of water, with the aid of a dispensette,<br>
and the mixture is stirred using a magnetic stirrer<br>
(speed about 1000 min-1) for five minutes with the pH<br>
electrode immersed.<br>
After the stirrer has been switched off the pH is read<br>
off after a standing time of one minute. The result is<br>
reported to one decimal place.<br>
Grindometer value<br>
Principles:<br>
The degree of dispersion determines the performance<br>
properties of the liquid thickened with Aerosil. The measurement of the grindometer value serves to assess<br>
the degree of dispersion. By the grindometer value is<br>
meant the boundary layer thickness below which the<br>
particles or aggregates present become visible on the<br><br>
surface of the sample which has been coated out.<br>
The sample is coated out in a groove with a scraper,<br>
the depth of the groove at one end being twice the size<br>
of the diameter of the largest Aerosil particles, and<br>
decreasing steadily down to 0 at the other end. On a<br>
scale indicating the depth of the groove, the depth<br>
value is read off, in micrometers, the value in ques-<br>
tion being that below which a relatively large number<br>
of Aerosil particles becomes visible as a result of<br>
bits or scratches on the surface of the binder system.<br>
The value read off is the grindometer value of the<br>
system present.<br>
Apparatus and reagents:<br>
Hegmann grindometer with a depth range of 100-0 micro-<br>
meter.<br>
Polyester resin dispersion with 2% Aerosil, prepared<br>
according to Testing Instructions 0380.<br>
Procedure:<br>
The grindometer block is placed on a flat, slip-proof<br>
surface and is wiped clean immediately prior to<br>
testing. The Aerosil dispersion, which must be free<br>
from air bubbles, is then applied to the deepest point<br>
of the groove in such a way that it flows off somewhat<br>
over the edge of the groove. The scraper is then held<br>
by both hands and placed, perpendicularly to the<br>
grindometer block and at right angles to its<br>
longitudinal edges, with gentle pressure, onto the end<br>
of the groove in which the dispersion is located. The<br>
dispersion is then coated out in the groove by slow,<br>
uniform drawing of the scraper over the block. The<br>
grindometer value is read off no later than 3 seconds<br>
after the dispersion has been coated out.<br>
The surface of the spread dispersion (transverse to the<br>
groove) is viewed obliquely from above at an angle of<br>
20-30° (to the surface). The block is held to the light<br><br>
in such a way that the surface structure of the spread<br>
dispersion is readily apparent.<br>
The grindometer value read off on the scale is the<br>
value in micrometers below which a relatively large<br>
number of Aerosil particles become visible as bits or<br>
scratches on the surface. Individual bits or scratches<br>
occurring randomly are not taken into account in this<br>
context.<br>
The granularity is assessed at least twice, in each<br>
case on a newly spread dispersion.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
From the measured values the arithmetic mean is formed.<br>
The relationship between the grindometer value in<br>
micrometers and the FSPT units and Hegmann units, which<br>
are based on the inch system, is as follows:<br>
B = 8-0.079 A<br>
C = 10-0.098 A = 1.25 B<br>
In this relationship:<br>
A = Grindometer value	in micrometers<br>
B = Grindometer value	in Hegmann units<br>
C = Grindometer value	in FSPT units<br>
Particle size determination by means of PCS<br>
Purpose:<br>
The method of analysis described below is used to<br>
determine the particle size distribution by means of<br>
photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS, dynamic light<br>
scattering) of the dispersed phase (mostly solid<br>
particles) in dispersions. This method is particularly<br>
suitable for determining particles and their aggregates<br>
whose size lies within the submicrometer range (10 nm<br>
to 3 µm) .<br><br>
General remarks, theory:<br>
The basis for particle size determination by means of<br>
PCS is the Stokes-Einstein equation, which demonstrates<br>
the relationship between particle size (expressed<br>
through the so-called hydrodynamic diameter d(H)) and<br>
the diffusion coefficient D of the particles:<br>
d(H) = kT/3 η.Π D<br>
Clearly this equation can be derived via an equilibrium<br>
of forces between the Brownian motion of the particles<br>
and the opposing flow resistance. From this equation it<br>
is also comfortably apparent which parameters must be<br>
known or constant: the viscosity T| of the dispersing<br>
medium, and the temperature T. If this is ensured, the<br>
hydrodynamic diameter can be calculated via the deter-<br>
mination of the diffusion coefficient. Expressed in<br>
other terms: large particles move slowly, small ones<br>
quickly.<br>
The movement of the particles in a dispersion can be<br>
monitored via the fluctuation in the scattered-light<br>
intensity of a laser beam. Where rapid movements are<br>
present, the fluctuation in intensity is small; slower<br>
particles generate more considerable fluctuations. By<br>
way of mathematical operations such as a Fourier<br>
transformation or an autocorrelation function, it is<br>
possible, from the fluctuation pattern of the<br>
scattered-light signal, which is constant on average,<br>
to infer a particle distribution.<br>
In the simplest case, a monodisperse distribution is<br>
assumed. If the logarithm of the autocorrelation func-<br>
tion is then plotted against the correlation time, the<br>
average diffusion constant is given by the slope of the<br>
best-fit line. This form of evaluation is known as<br><br>
"cumulant analysis". In reality this relationship is<br>
usually non-linear, since the distributions present are<br>
not actually monodisperse. As a measure of the breadth<br>
of distribution the polydispersity index "PI" is<br>
defined, by adapting a third-degree polynomial rather<br>
than a straight line. The "PI" is then PI = 2c/b2 where<br>
b and c are the coefficients of second and third<br>
degree.<br>
In order to determine volume-weighted or mass-weighted<br>
averages, however, it is necessary to consider the Mie<br>
theory (comprehensive scattered-light theory), which<br>
presupposes a knowledge of the refractive indices of<br>
particle and dispersion medium. In order to gain even<br>
more information from the intensity fluctuations, it is<br>
possible mathematically to adapt distributions other<br>
than, for example, one (or more) log-normal distribu-<br>
tion (s). An established method of achieving this is the<br>
so-called "Contin" analysis, which encompasses lopsided<br>
and also multimodal distributions.<br>
Since the definition of the hydrodynamic diameter<br>
derives from the assumption of spherical form of the<br>
particles, the measurement result obtained must always<br>
be understood, in the case of non-spherical particles,<br>
as an equivalent spherical diameter. This means that<br>
the diameter assumed is that of a sphere which causes<br>
the same intensity fluctuations as the non-spherical<br>
particles under determination. Only indirectly, there-<br>
fore, does the hydrodynamic diameter have anything to<br>
do with an "actual size".<br>
Measurement prerequisites, restrictions:<br>
The structure of the scattered-light geometry of<br>
different instruments gives rise to technical restric-<br>
tions on the measurement. The conventional PCS instru-<br>
ment, such as the Malvern Zetasizer 3000 instrument<br><br>
used here, uses a scattered-light angle of 90°. In<br>
order to rule out multiple scattering, which would<br>
falsify the result, the sample under measurement must<br>
with this geometry be highly diluted. Indicative values<br>
are a concentration of 0.001%-0.01% by weight.<br>
Obviously the dispersions under measurement ought to be<br>
translucent and to have only a slight turbidity. Other<br>
geometries also permit the use of higher concentra-<br>
tions. Hence depending on particle type (particle<br>
density, morphology) it is possible to carry out<br>
measurement even of concentrations from 0.5% to 30% by<br>
weight. For this purposes, for example, the Horiba LB<br>
500 instrument uses a back-scattering optical system<br>
for which the ratio between single and multiple<br>
scattering is virtually constant and can therefore be<br>
disregarded. In the case of the alternative 3D cross-<br>
correlation technique it is possible to eliminate the<br>
fraction of multiply scattered light mathematically<br>
through the use of two independent laser beams. Where<br>
high concentrations are used, however, there is a<br>
further restriction to be observed: the determination<br>
of the diffusion constant presupposes the free mobility<br>
of the particles, which at high concentrations is no<br>
longer the case. For this reason, with instruments<br>
which allow the use of higher concentrations, dilution<br>
series ought to be routinely measured.<br>
Determining the particle size distribution by means of<br>
PCS requires knowledge of the following physical<br>
parameters:<br>
Temperature of the dispersion<br>
In the case of the Zetasizer 3000 the sample holder is<br>
thermally conditioned by way of a Peltier element<br>
(25°C), and the temperature is held constant during the<br>
measurement. This is important in order to rule out<br>
convection movement within the cell, which would super-<br><br>
impose itself on the free movement of the particles.<br>
The Horiba LB500 measures the temperature in the cell<br>
and takes account of the temperature it measures in the<br>
context of the evaluation.<br>
Viscosity of the dispersion medium<br>
In the case of the highly diluted systems this is not<br>
critical, since in that case the viscosities of the<br>
pure solvents at 25°C, for example, are well known. It<br>
is necessary, however, to ensure that the right<br>
viscosity is used for the calculation.<br>
Refractive index of particles and dispersion medium<br>
These figures are needed only for the volume-weighted<br>
evaluation. For determining a cumulant analysis (zave,<br>
PI) these details are unimportant. For standard systems<br>
there are tabular values (see instrument handbook); in<br>
the case for example of surface-modified substances,<br>
however, one ought to be aware of this possible source<br>
of error if the refractive index is not known with<br>
precision, and in that case only the cumulant analysis<br>
ought to be used.<br>
Furthermore, the following preconditions must be met:<br>
The dispersion must be stable to sedimentation.<br>
Sedimentation in the cell not only generates additional<br>
movement in the particles (see above) but also alters<br>
the scattered-light intensity during measurement.<br>
Moreover, it depletes the dispersion of larger parti-<br>
cles, which collect on the bottom of the cell. For this<br>
reason the scattered-light intensity should be moni-<br>
tored during the measurement ("count rate"). If this<br>
count rate is not stable, the result ought not to be<br>
interpreted. This restriction is the reason why the<br>
upper measurement limit for PCS is dependent on the<br><br>
difference in density between particle and dispersion<br>
medium.<br>
To dilute the dispersion to measurement concentration<br>
it is necessary to use extremely clean, dust-free<br>
solvent (generally water). This is particularly impor-<br>
tant for the measurement of small particles and also in<br>
highly dilute dispersions.<br>
Instruments:<br>
Malvern Zetasizer 3000 HSa instrument<br>
Disposable cells 10 x 10 x 48 mm (e.g. Sarstedt Ref.<br>
67.754) for aqueous dispersions or glass cells 10 x 10<br>
x 48 mm for solvent-containing dispersions.<br>
Glass beaker<br>
Syringe (20 ml)<br>
Disposable filter 200 µm (for example Macherey-Nagel<br>
Chromafil A-20/25, cellulose mixed ester)<br>
Disposable pipette<br>
Software, settings<br>
The Malvern Zetasizer 3000 HSa instrument is controlled<br>
via a computer program which also carries out the<br>
evaluation of the measurement signal and allows the<br>
results to be archived and printed out. As regards the<br>
operation of the program, refer to the handbook.<br>
Prior to each measurement it is necessary to perform<br>
the following settings within the software:<br>
Input of the refractive indices of particle and medium<br>
(see above)<br>
Input of the viscosity of the dispersion medium (see<br>
above)<br>
Designation and notes relating to the sample<br>
Path and file for archiving of the result<br><br>
In addition the following settings are present as<br>
standard and are generally not changed:<br>
10 measurements are collated to form one series and<br>
their average is expressed as the result.<br>
3 such measurements are carried out per sample.<br>
There is a waiting time of 1 minute before each<br>
measurement (for constant temperature).<br>
Attenuator "Auto" (instrument automatically attenuates<br>
the signal intensity down to a factor of 128, so that<br>
it is not necessary to prepare the sample with such<br>
precision).<br>
Data analysis "Contin"<br>
Other settings: dilation 1.20; weighting "quadratic";<br>
size range "Auto"; point select "Auto", by cut off<br>
0.01; optical properties 0.00, core real 1.6, core<br>
imag. 0; Mark-Houwink parameters A 0.5 cm2/s, K<br>
0.000138.<br>
Procedure:<br>
Sample preparation:<br>
20 ml of pure solvent (generally fully demineralized<br>
water) are filtered, using a syringe, through a 200 µm<br>
filter and then introduced into a clean, dust-free<br>
glass beaker. If the dispersion under measurement has<br>
been made acidic or basic, demineralized water adjusted<br>
accordingly is used, in order to prevent a pH shock<br>
when the dispersion is diluted. Then one drop of the<br>
dispersion is added, using a disposable pipette, to the<br>
solvent, and the glass beaker is swirled gently for<br>
some time until the drop has dispersed homogeneously,<br>
and a slight turbid solution has formed. This solution<br><br>
is introduced using a second disposable pipette into<br>
the cell, which is sealed and fixed in the instrument's<br>
cell holder.<br>
Instrument preparation<br>
The instrument and also the attached computer are<br>
switched on and the associated measurement program is<br>
started. After the instrument has been switched on it<br>
is necessary to wait a while, since laser and Peltier<br>
element must first come up to operating temperature.<br>
Generally, therefore, the instrument is switched off<br>
only in cases of prolonged standstill (several days).<br>
Measurement and evaluation:<br>
At the beginning of the measurement it is necessary<br>
first of all to input the sample parameters and sample<br>
designation and also to select the file in which the<br>
measurements are to be stored. The actual measurements<br>
are started by clicking on the "Go" button. The results<br>
of the three measurements are subsequently compared.<br>
When there is a good match one of the measurements is<br>
selected and represented as a volume-weighted distribu-<br>
tion by selection of the menu item "View -&gt; New plot -&gt;<br>
Volume". Selecting "Copy -&gt; Table as Text" transfers<br>
the result via the Clipboard to Excel, where it is<br>
converted, using a macro, into a report file (XLS). The<br>
Excel file generated in this way is stored on the<br>
server.<br>
If the values of the individual measurements do not<br>
match, a repeat measurement is carried out. If it is<br>
apparent that during the measurements there are sharp<br>
fluctuations in the count rate occurring, the result is<br>
not evaluated and the particle size measurement is<br>
carried out, where appropriate, by a different method.<br><br>
II. Silicone rubber compounds<br>
Examples 13 to 16<br>
The experiments for determining the surface properties<br>
of silicone vulcanizates were carried out in a speed<br>
mixer, with the following formulation:<br><br>
A polyethylene beaker which can be screwed closed with<br>
a lid is charged with 31 g (62%) of α,ω-hydroxydi-<br>
methylsiloxypolydimethylsiloxane (E 50, GE Bayer<br>
Silicones). Subsequently 12.5 g (25%) of α,ω-trimethyl-<br>
siloxypolydimethylsiloxane (M1000, GE Bayer Silicones)<br>
are added. After addition of 0.5 g (1%) of carbon black<br>
(Printex 3, Degussa AG) the mixture is mixed in the<br>
speed mixer at 2500 rpm for 15 seconds.<br>
Then 2.0 g (4%) of ethyltriacetoxysilane (AC 3034, GE<br>
Bayer Silicones) are added to this mixture and the<br>
components are mixed in the speed mixer at 2500 rpm for<br>
15 seconds. Subsequently 4.0 g (8%) of fumed silica are<br>
mixed in at 2500 rpm within 30 seconds or in two steps<br>
(2 X 15 seconds) in the speed mixer. Material clinging<br>
to the inner wall is stripped off and the batch is<br><br>
again mixed at 2500 rpm for 30 seconds. Addition of 1<br>
drop (0.01%) of dibutyltin dilaurate is followed by<br>
speed mixer mixing at 2500 rpm for 120 seconds. The<br>
silicone formulation obtained in this way is coated<br>
with a coating bar and vulcanized at room temperature<br>
in ambient air over a period of 24 hours. The surface<br>
of the vulcanizates is inspected and evaluated on a<br>
school-grade system:<br>
Grades: 1 - very good, 2 = good, 3 = satisfactory, 4 =<br>
unsatisfactory, 5 = deficient<br>
Grade 1 is awarded when the vulcanizate has no defects<br>
or undispersed particles.<br>
For grade 2 there are only a very few defects visible.<br>
In the case of grade 3 there are somewhat more.<br>
In the case of grade 4 the number of visible defects is<br>
such that the surface appearance would be unacceptable<br>
for technical use.<br>
The same applies to a grading of 5, only more so.<br>
When the inventive silicas are used in accordance with<br>
Examples 3, 6 and 9, surprisingly, the silicone<br>
vulcanizates have good surface properties in comparison<br>
to the standard material.<br>
The silicone vulcanizate with the standard material<br>
shows only an unsatisfactory surface, which is also<br>
hardly surprising, since silicas of high surface area<br>
cannot generally be used in silicone sealants, for<br>
precisely that reason.<br><br><br><br>
