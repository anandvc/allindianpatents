				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for measurement of endwinding vibration on turbogenerator stator.<br>
Vibration measurement are being carried out on the endwinding of stator during performance testing of turbogenerator at testing stand or at loading conditions at site. Normally the vibrations are measured on neutral nose joints of ovehang on both the ends of generator namely Exciter and Turbine ends at rated current (short circuit conditi-ions), rated voltage (open circuit condition) and during actual operation of generator at site.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Presently, the vibration measurement is accomplished by mounting a small base-plate of insulating material on neutral nose joints of stator overhang and fixing with special glue(putty). The vibration probe is then screwed on to the base-plate after the putty gets completely cured. The measuring cables connected to each mounted vibration probe are then routed through the generator winding overhang and brought outside through specially designed gland sealing system for connecting the measuring instrumentation system outside the generator.<br><br>
Some of the important tests being performed on the generator winding at works are: High Voltage Test, Dielectric Tests, Sudden Short Circuit Test etc. For carrying out dielectric tests such as Tan£&gt; , Partial Discharge, Dielectric Loss Energy at nominal voltage of specific generator, the vibration probe system on the end winding used to be dismantled in order to avoid electrical discharges/flashover and inturn damage to the low voltage probes due to high voltage application and also any likely fire hazard to the mahine. I Thus, testing of generator winding with external<br>
high voltage application is possible only after dismantling<br><br>
of vibration probe system from the generator, <br>
There are disadvantages in the present system of performance testing of turbogenerator at the testing stand.<br>
Main disadvantage is that during sequential testing of the generator especially at test stand the vibration probe system is dismantled from the generator. - Another disadvantage associated with the present system of performance testing of turbogenerator is that in the case of hydrogen cooled generators, the hydrogen gas filled in for cooling has to be removed from the generator.<br><br>
- Yet another disadvantage associated with the present system of performance testing of turbogenerators is that the generator has to be opened up i.e. end shields of the generator at both the ends have to be removed. It involves extra work, man power and time delay at crucial testing stage.<br>
Further disadvantages associated with the present system of performance testing of turbogenerators is that the intended test conditions are not maintained due to dismantling of vibration probe system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention of performance testing of turbogenerators is to provide a special endwinding vibration measuring system which can withstand external high voltage upto nominal voltage without dismantling the vibration probe thus, eliminates all the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide stator endwinding vibration measuring system on the turbogenerators which are subjected to external high voltage during performance testing. The type of turbogenerators are; Air cooled, Hydrogen cooled, Stator water and hydrogen cooled, rated upto 21kV.<br><br>
Yet  another  object of the present invention is  to<br>
provide stator endwindings vibration measuring system for<br>
turbogenerators whih is  simple and the main component of<br>
the system comprises piezolectric vibration probes (accelerators), probe mounting base plates, cables, gland sealing system etc.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide stator endwindings vibration measuring system for turbogenerators in which the mounting device is the base plate made of monolithic electrical insulating material, compact in shape and size and is used for mounting vibration probe. The base plate is installed inside the turbogenerator on the stator overhang at specific locations with special glue for carrying out endwinding vibration measurement.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a device with a vibration probe to withstand the rated high voltage of the respective turbogenerator without any flashover or electrical discharges during the application of external high voltage for dielectric measurement like Tan , PD or DLE on the winding. With this there is no need for dismantling of vibratio probe system from the generator while carrying out these tests reducing time and man power.<br><br>
Still a further object of the present invention is to provide stator endwindings vibration measuring system for turbogenerators wherein the 'base-plate-vibration probe system can withstand electrical potential upto 15.kV when the connecting leads are grounded and upto 21 kV when the connecting leads are kept floated individually without adverse effect on the machine.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided<br>
a device for measurement of endwinding vibration of turbo-<br>
generator  stator comprising a L shaped bar plate  said base—plate is mounted ono texto-<br>
lite sheet by a over a by joint     cables   from   said prose late<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show details of the base plate (1) of the invention. Figures 3 and 4 show tw variants of the device of the endwinding vibration system which consists of piezo type accelerometer probes (5), probe mounting base plates (1), double screened minature cables (6) and especially designed textolite-rubber based gland sealing system (9,10) for plugging the leakage of circulating coolant (Hydrogen) inside generator stator body. The probes (5) are charge type accelerometers. The base-plate (1) for mounting the probes (5) is made of epoxy-glass insulating material and its shape and size are as per drawing attached. It has two SS studs fixed at the holes (12) for screwing the vibration probes (5) . The holes with SS studs are made void free by filling resin-hardener mixture. This, additionally helps to avoid loosening of the studs. The whole base-plate (1) is then coated with red enamel paint to make it moisture resistant and avoid tracking problem.<br>
The base plate (1) for mounting the probes (5) is made up of epoxy-glass insulating material and its shape and size has been indicated in Figures 1 and 2.<br><br>
The base plate (1) has two SS studs fixed at holes (12) for screwing the vibration probes(5). The holes (12) with SS studs are made void free by filling resin-hardener mixture. This additionally helps  to avoid loosening of the studs.<br>
The whole base-plate (1) is then coated with red enamel paint<br>
Valfeh<br>
to make it moisture resistant and avlid-tracking problem.<br>
The striking feature of this base -plate (1) is its configuration which has been optimally arrived at after exhaustive experimentation .Moreover, it has monolithic construction and compactnes to withstand the application of external rated high voltage of the machine (during dielectric testing) without any flashover or electrical discharges when it is mounted on the end winding of the stator.<br>
Single base-plate (1) is used for fixing two vibration probes (5); one at radial and the other at tangential direction. This, in turn, is fixed on the end winding of turbogenerator stator overhang basket for carrying out endwinding vibration measurements during performance testing at works as well as during actual operation at site.<br>
The signal cables (6) used in the endwinding vibration measuring system are coated with graphite in order to reduce the extraneous electromagnetic noise. These cables are meticulously routed through the overhang system without any hindrance to other components and at the same time keeping a safe clearance against high voltage.<br><br>
The gland sealing system (9,10) consists of two textolite circular plates (9) with necessary holes and a sealing rubber plate, silicon rubber gland (10) also with holes sandwiched between them. The cables (6) from the probes (5) are taken out of the generator body through this sealing system. This gland sealing system (9,10) ensures proper sealing of the out coming cables (6).<br>
Turbogenerator stator end winding vibrations are being carried out during performance testing of the machine at test bed, to meet specific customer requirement and also for generat ing reference OEM data.<br>
Base plate (1) of epoxy insulating material are fixed with special putty (2) on neutral nose joints (12) of stator windings on both sides; turbine and exciter end of the generator. The probes (5) are screwed on these base plate (1) and connecting leads are taken out from respect probe (5) and routed through the overhang basket and finally through a special gland sealing arrangement (9,10) of stator body for connecting to measuring instrument. Thus, the vibration measurement are carried out during performance testing/normal operation of the machine.<br><br>
The dielectric measurements like Tanb , DLE and PD are required to be carried out upto Un as per customer's quality plan during shop testing and also during overhauling of the machine at site. During these test, external high voltag (HV) is applied to all the windings of respective phases separately. Consequently, under the application of HV, the probes (5) alongwith base plates (1) already mounted on neutral bars of the end-windings for vibration measurement purpose are subjected to certain level of high voltage depending on the capacitive distribution of base plate (1) insulation.<br>
In order to avoid any electrical discharges around the 'probe-base plate assembly' a special base plate (1) of epoxy-glass material has been designed after exhaustive mock-up tests under HV application. The drawing is as per Figure 1 and 2. The new base plate-probe assembly (15) with cables 16 developed obviates the need for dismantling of vibration probes during the testing of Tanb , DLE and pd at works and also during overhauling of the machine at site wherein external HV is applied.<br>
