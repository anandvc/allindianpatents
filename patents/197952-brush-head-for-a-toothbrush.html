				<td>The present invention relates to a brush head for a toothbrush according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In known toothbrushes, the bristle carrier consists of a material which is hard at room temperature and encloses the clusters of bristles at one end thereof.<br>
The object of the present invention, then, is to provide a brush head of the type mentioned in the introduction which permits better adaptation, for cleaning purposes, to the shape of the teeth as a whole and of the individual teeth.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a brush head according to claim 1.<br>
Since, at the anchoring end, the clusters of bristles are embedded in a soft/resilient material, i.e. in a material which can be elastically compressed and expanded, the bristle carrier is provided with increased flexibility. As a result, during usage, the clusters of bristles can be better adapted to the shape of the teeth individually and as a whole.<br>
Preferred developments of the brush head according to the invention are outlined in the dependent claims.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides Brush head for a toothbrush, having a bristle carrier and clusters of bristles which are anchored in the bristle carrier, comprise projecting bristles and, at the anchoring end, are enclosed by a soft/ resilient material of the bristle carrier ,characterize4d in that the clusters of bristles are retained individually in sleeves which are embedded at a distance apart from one another in the soft/resilient material of the bristle carrier and are connected to one another by this material, or, combined to form groups, are retained in each case in a connecting part serving as a retaining part, and the connecting parts are spaced apart from one another and enclosed by the soft/resilient material of the bristle carrier .<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
Figures 1 and 2 respectively show a first embodiment of a brush head in plan view and in section along line II-II in fig. 1,<br><br>
Figures 3 and 4 show two variants of the first exemplary-embodiment in plan view,<br>
Figure 5      shows  a  third  variant  of  the  first<br>
exemplary embodiment in section, cor-responding to the illustration of Figure 2,<br>
Figures 6 and 7 respectively show a second embodiment of<br>
a brush head in plan view and in section along line VII-VII in Figure 6,<br>
Figures 8 and 9 respectively show a third embodiment of a<br>
brush head in plan view and side view,<br>
Figures 10 and 11  respectively  show a  section  along<br>
line X-X in Figure 8 and a section along line XI-XI in Figure 9,<br>
Figures 12 and 13  respectively show a fourth embodiment<br>
of a brush head in plan view and in section along line XIII-XIII in Figure 12, and<br>
Figures 14 and 15  respectively show a fifth embodiment<br>
of a brush head in plan view and in section along line XV-XV in Figure 14. A brush head 1 and part of the handle 2 of a<br>
toothbrush are shown in Figure 1, in plan view and in<br>
Figure 2, in section along line II-II of Figure 1. The<br>
brush head 1 has a bristle carrier 3 in which projecting<br>
clusters of bristles 4, each of which comprises a multi-i plicity of bristles, are anchored. At the anchoring end,<br>
each cluster of bristles 4 is fastened in a sleeve 5.<br>
The sleeves 5 with the clusters of bristles 4 are spaced<br><br>
apart from one another and, in the present exemplary-embodiment, arranged, for example, in rows which extend parallel, and at right angles, to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush. The bristle carrier 3 consists of a soft/resilient material which can be elastically com¬pressed and expanded, e.g. of an elastomer. The sleeves 5 are embedded in this elastomeric material, which, on the one hand, produces the connection between the sleeves 5 and, on the other hand, gives a certain degree of flexibility to the bristle carrier.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate, in plan view, vari¬ants of the first exemplary embodiment according to Figures 1 and 2. In these two variants, rather than being inserted individually into the soft/resilient material of the bristle carrier 3, the clusters of bristles 4 are combined to form groups 6. The clusters of bristles 4 of each group 6 are connected to one another by means of connecting parts 7 which serve as retaining parts. Each connecting part 7 has holes 7a, into which the clusters of bristles 4 are inserted. The connecting parts 7 are enclosed wholly or partially by the soft/resilient material of the bristle carrier 3.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 3, the connecting parts 7 extend transversely, preferably approximately at right angles, to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush. Each group 6 thus comprises a number of clusters of bristles 4 which are arranged one beside the other in the connecting part 7.<br>
In contrast, the configuration in the variants according to Figure 4 is more versatile since the con¬necting parts 7 are of different shapes. As is shown in Figure 4,  it is also possible for both clusters of<br><br>
bristles 4 which are anchored individually in sleeves 5 and clusters of bristles 4 which are combined to form groups 6 to be arranged in the same bristle carrier 3.<br>
It goes without saying that arrangements of individual clusters of bristles 4 and groups of clusters of bristles 4, as well as shapes of connecting parts 7, which differ from those shown in Figures 3 and 4 are also possible.<br>
A third variant of the first exemplary embodiment is shown, partially in section, in Figure 5. In this embodiment, the sleeves 5 of a group 6 of clusters of bristles, e.g. of a longitudinal or transverse row, are connected to one another by means of flexible connecting webs 8. These connecting webs 8 are embedded fully in the material of the bristle carrier 3.<br>
The interspaces between the sleeves 5 or the groups 6, comprising a number of clusters of bristles 4 which are connected to one another, are filled with the soft/resilient material of the bristle carrier 3. This allows relative movement between the sleeves 5 or the groups 6 of clusters of bristles, which, during cleaning of the teeth, permits adaptation to the shape of the teeth individually and as a whole.<br>
In the second embodiment according to Figures 6 and 7, which has a certain similarity to the first embodiment, all the sleeves 5, in which the clusters of bristles 4 are anchored at one end, are connected to one another, to be precise by means of a connecting part 9 (Figure 7) which forms the rear side of the bristle carrier 3. This connecting part 9 is comparatively thin and flexible. A cover layer 10 made of a soft/resilient material, e.g. an elastomer, is located over said con-<br><br>
necting part 9. This soft/resilient material encloses the sleeves 5 and fills the interspaces between these sleeves 5.<br>
The cover layer 10 made of elastomeric material largely determines the elastic properties of the bristle carrier 3.<br>
Figures 8-11 show a third embodiment of a brush head according to the invention.<br>
This embodiment provides retaining means 12 for the clusters of bristles 4, said retaining means being spaced apart from one another and, in the exemplary embodiment shown, extending at right angles to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush and running parallel to one another. A number of clusters of bristles 4, in the present case three clusters of bristles 4, are anchored in each retaining means 12. At its two ends, each retaining means 12 is connected, via an articulation 13 in each case (Figures 10 and 11) , to a frame 14 which is integral with the handle 2. The frame 4 is rectangular and has two mutually parallel longitudinal legs 14a and 14b, on which the articulations 13 are provided.<br>
The frame 14 may also be of a shape which differs from a rectangle, for example it may also be designed to be oval or round.<br>
The articulations 13 of each retaining means 12 define a tilting axis B which, in the exemplary embodi¬ment shown, runs at right angles to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush. Each retaining means 12 can be pivoted about its tilting axis B. It is also possible for the retaining means 12 to be arranged in the frame<br><br>
14	such that the tilting axes B run obliquely with<br>
respect to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush.<br>
The frame 14 is provided with a top covering 15 and a bottom covering 15', both being made of a soft/resilient material, e.g. an elastomer. The material of the coverings 15, 15' runs through the interspaces 16 between the retaining means 12 (Figure 11), as a result of which the coverings 15, 15' are connected to one another. The capacity of the retaining means 12, along with the clusters of bristles 4 inserted therein, for movement is also determined by the elastomeric material of the coverings 15, 15' which encloses them.<br>
It is also possible for only the top cover layer<br>
15	or only the bottom cover layer 15' to be provided, or<br>
even for both cover layers 15, 15' to be dispensed with.<br>
In all these cases, at least the interspaces 16 between<br>
the retaining means 12 are filled by a soft/resilient<br>
material and the retaining means 12 are enclosed (wholly<br>
or partially) by a soft/elastic material.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, which is shown in Figures 12 and 13, the clusters of bristles 4 are anchored in a thin, flexible retaining part 17. The latter is integral with the handle 2, i.e. consists of the same material. Provided on the underside of the retaining part 17, which belongs to the bristle carrier 3, is a bottom cover layer 18 made of a soft/resilient material. On the top side, the retaining part 17 is provided with a top cover layer 19, which likewise consists of a soft/resilient material.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Figures 12 and 13, the retaining part 17, together with the cover layers 18 and 19, forms a sandwich structure, the<br><br>
flexibility of which is determined by the flexible properties of the retaining part 17, on the one hand, and of the cover layers 18, 19, on the other hand.<br>
The fifth embodiment, which is illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, has a bristle carrier 3 which consists of the same material as the handle 2 and is integral therewith. The clusters of bristles 4 are anchored in said bristle carrier 3.<br>
Formed in the bristle carrier 3 are two dep¬ressions 21 and 22 which run transversely, preferably approximately at right angles, to the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush. These depressions 21, 22 are open toward the top side 3a of the bristle carrier 3, i.e. toward the clusters of bristles 4. These depressions 21, 22 are filled with a filler element 23 made of a soft/resilient material, e.g. an elastomer.<br>
The bristle carrier 3 is weakened by these depressions 21, 22, i.e. it has greater flexibility at the locations of these depressions 21, 22. The flexi¬bility of the bristle carrier 3 is also determined by the filler elements 23, which, as has been mentioned, consist of a material which can be elastically compressed and expanded.<br>
Provided in the bristle carrier 3 is a groove 24, which runs in the direction of the longitudinal axis A of the toothbrush. This groove 24 is filled with an insert 25 made of a soft/resilient material.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A brush head for a toothbrush, having a bristle carrier (3) and<br>
clusters of bristles (4) which are anchored in the bristle carrier, comprise<br>
projecting bristles and, at the anchoring end, are enclosed by a soft/ resilient<br>
