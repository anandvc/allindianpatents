				<td>SYNERGISTIC MICROBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
This invention relates to synergistic combinations of selected microbicides with other microbicides, formulation ingredients, or raw materials that result in a composition with surprisingly greater antimicrobial activity than one would expect from combinations of the individual components, based on their individual antimicrobial activity.<br>
In some cases, commercial microbicides cannot provide effective control of certain microorganisms, even at high use concentrations, due to weak activity against certain types or species of microorganisms and/or due to aggressive environmental conditions. Combinations of different microbicides are sometimes used to provide overall control of multiple species of microorganisms in a particular end use environment. For example, combinations of 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one with other biocides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2004/0014799 and combinations of l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one with other biocides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. App. Publ No. 2006/0106024. However, there is still a need for additional combinations of microbicides, or combinations of microbicides with formulation ingredients or raw materials, having enhanced activity against various strains of microorganisms to provide for their effective control. In addition, there is still a need for combinations containing lower levels of individual microbicides for environmental and economic benefit. The problem addressed by this invention is to provide such additional combinations of isothiazolin-3-one microbicides with other microbicides, formulation ingredients, or raw materials.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composition comprising a microbicidally synergistic mixture of:<br>
(a)	2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one; and<br>
(b)	one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of anisic acid, decylene glycol, diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (DTPA), hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA), imminodisuccinate (IDS), maleic acid, methyl glycine diacetic acid (MDGA), phenoxypropanol, phytic acid, and propionic acid.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composition comprising a microbicidally synergistic mixture of:<br>
(a)	l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one; and<br>
(b)	one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of anisic acid, capric acid, decylene glycol, diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (DTPA), etidronic acid,<br>
gluconic acid, hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA), imminodisuccinate (IDS), maleic acid, methyl glycine diacetic acid (MDGA), phenoxypropanol, phytic acid, and propionic acid.<br>
"MIT" is 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, also referred to by the name 2-methyl-3-isothiazolone or methylisothiazolinone. "BIT" is l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one. "Anisic acid" is 4-methoxybenzoic acid. "Capric Acid" is decanoic acid. "Ddecylene glycol" is 1,2-decanediol. "DTPA" is diethylene triamine pentacetic acid. "Etidronic acid" is hydroxyethylidene bisphosphoric acid. "Gluconic acid" is pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. "HEDTA" is hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid. "IDS" is iminodisuccinate. "Maleic acid" is 2-butenedioic acid. "MDGA" is methyl glycine diacetic acid. "Phenoxypropanol" is propylene glycol phenyl ether. "Phytic acid" is inositol hexaphosphoric acid. "Propionic acid" is ethanecarboxylic acid.<br>
As used herein, the following terms have the designated definitions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The term "microbicide", "biocide", "preservative" or "antimicrobial" refers to a compound capable of killing, inhibiting the growth of, or controlling the growth of microorganisms at a locus; microbicides include, but are not limited to, bactericides, fungicides and algicides. The term "microorganism" includes, for example, fungi (such as, for example, yeast and mold), bacteria, and algae. The term "locus" refers to an industrial system or product, a personal care system or product, a home care system or product, or other environment subject to contamination by microorganisms. The term "compound" refers to a microbicide, a formulation ingredient, or a raw material. The following abbreviations are used throughout this specification: ppm = parts per million by weight (weight/weight), mL = milliliter, ATCC = American Type Culture Collection, MBC = minimum biocidal concentration, and MIC = minimum inhibitory concentration. Unless otherwise specified, temperatures are in degrees Celcius (Â°C), and references to percentages (%) are by weight. Amounts of organic microbicides are given on an active ingredient basis in ppm (w/w). Ratios are by weight and may be expressed as, for example, 1/400 or 1:400.<br>
The compositions of the present invention have been found to provide unexpectedly enhanced microbicidal efficacy at an active ingredient level lower than what would be expected for a combination of the individual microbicides, or the microbicides in combination with formulation ingredients or raw materials, based on their individual efficacy.<br>

The microbicides, formulation ingredients, and raw materials in each composition of this invention may be used "as is" or may first be formulated with a solvent or a solid carrier. Suitable solvents include, for example, water; glycols, such as, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; glycol ethers; alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, and phenethyl alcohol; ketones, such as, for example, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone; esters, such as, for example, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, triacetyl citrate, and glycerol triacetate; carbonates, such as, for example, propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate; and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the solvent is selected from water, glycols, glycol ethers, esters, and mixtures thereof. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, cyclodextrins, silicas, diatomaceous earth, clays, inorganic salts, sugars, starches, polymeries, silicates, clathrates, zeolites, waxes, cellulosic materials, (including, for example, chloride, nitrate, bromide, and sulfate derivatives), and charcoal.<br>
When a microbicide, formulation ingredient, or raw material component is formulated in a solvent, the formulation may optionally contain surfactants. Surfactants include, for example, anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric surfactants and mixtures thereof. When such formulations contain surfactants, they are generally in the form of emulsion concentrates, emulsions, microemulsion concentrates, or microemulsions. Emulsion concentrates form emulsions upon the addition of a sufficient amount of water.<br>
Microemulsion concentrates form microemulsions upon the addition of a sufficient amount of water. Such emulsion and microemulsion concentrates are generally well known in the art. U.S. Patent No. 5,444,078 may be consulted for further general and specific details on the preparation of various microemulsions and microemulsion concentrates. In some embodiments, such emulsions and microemulsions are free of surfactants.<br>
A microbicide, formulation ingredient, or raw material component also may be formulated in the form of a dispersion. The solvent component of the dispersion may be, for example, an organic solvent or water. In some embodiments the solvent component is water only. Dispersions may contain one or more optional adjuvants such as, for example, co-solvents, thickeners, anti-freeze agents, dispersants, fillers, pigments, surfactants, biodispersants, sulfosuccinates, terpenes, furanones, polycations, stabilizers, scale inhibitors, and anti-corrosion additives.<br>
When the microbicide, formulation ingredient, or raw material are each first formulated with a solvent, the solvent used for the first component may be the same as or different from the solvent used to formulate the other component. In some embodiments water is preferred for many biocide applications. In some embodiments the two solvents are miscible.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the microbicide, formulation ingredient, or raw material components of the present invention may be added to a locus sequentially, simultaneously, or may be combined before being added to the locus. In one embodiment of the invention, the first component and the second component are added to a locus simultaneously or sequentially. When the components are added simultaneously or sequentially, each may independently contain one or more optional adjuvants.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be used to prevent or inhibit the growth of microorganisms or higher forms of aquatic life (such as, for example, protozoans, invertebrates, bryozoans, dinoflagellates, crustaceans, mollusks, etc) by introducing a microbicidally effective amount of the compositions onto, into, or at a locus subject to microbial attack. Suitable loci include, for example: industrial process water; electrocoat deposition systems,; cooling towers; air washers; gas scrubbers; mineral slurries; wastewater treatment; ornamental fountains; reverse osmosis filtration; ultrafiltration; ballast water; evaporative condensers; heat exchangers; pulp and paper processing fluids and additives; starch; plastics; emulsions; dispersions; paints; latices; coatings, such as varnishes; construction products, such as mastics, caulks, and sealants; construction adhesives, such as ceramic adhesives, carpet backing adhesives, and laminating adhesives; industrial or<br>
consumer adhesives; photographic chemicals; printing fluids; household and personal care products, such as, for example, bathroom and kitchen cleaners; cosmetics; lotions, moisturizers, toiletries; hair styling creams, pastes, or gums; conditioners, 2 in 1 conditioning shampoos, body wash/shower gels, liquid soaps, sunscreen lotions and sprays, tanning lotions, skin care lotions, one and two-part hair dyes, permanent waving formulations, soaps; detergents; cleaners; floor polishes; laundry rinse water; metalworking fluids; conveyor lubricants; hydraulic fluids; leather and leather products; textiles; textile products; wood and wood products, such as, for example, plywood, chipboard, flakeboard, laminated beams, oriented strandboard, hardboard, and particleboard; petroleum processing fluids; fuel; oilfield fluids, such as injection water, fracture fluids, and drilling muds; agriculture adjuvant preservation; surfactant preservation; medical devices; diagnostic reagent preservation; food preservation, such as plastic or paper food wrap; food, beverage, and industrial process pasteurizers; toilet bowls; recreational water; pools; and spas.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms at a locus selected from one or more of cosmetics; sunscreens, lotions, toiletries; hair styling creams, pastes, or gums; conditioners, 2 in 1 conditioning shampoos, body wash/shower gels, liquid soaps, sunscreen lotions and sprays, tanning lotions, skin care lotions, one and two-part hair dyes, permanent waving formulations, soaps; and detergents.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that the specific amount of a composition of this invention necessary to inhibit or control the growth of microorganisms and higher aquatic life forms in a locus depends upon the type, species, and/or identity of the microorganism or higher aquatic life form and the particular locus to be protected. Typically, the amount of the composition of the present invention to control the growth of microorganisms in a locus is sufficient if it provides from 0.1 to 1,000 ppm of the 3-isothiazoline ingredient of the composition in the locus. In one embodiment, the 3-isothiazolone ingredient of the composition is present in the locus in an amount of at least 0.5 ppm, in another embodiment at least 1 ppm, and in a further embodiment at least 10 ppm. In one embodiment, the isothiazolone ingredient of the composition is present in the locus in an amount of no more than 1000 ppm, in another embodiment no more than 500 ppm, and in a further embodiment no more than 200 ppm.<br>
The compositions of this invention may optionally contain one or more additional microbicides in order to afford a composition having broader efficacy against microorganisms. Such microbicides are selected from known microbicides on the basis of<br>
their ability to control specific microorganisms and the specific locus to be preserved. Some embodiments of this invention comprise no additional microbicides. EXAMPLES Materials and Methods<br>
The synergy of the combinations of the present invention was demonstrated by testing a wide range of concentrations and ratios of the compounds against the noted organisms. One skilled in the art will recognize that the sensitivity of other microorganisms to the particular combinations will vary and, as a result, the concentrations, the ratios, for each, or both, of the compounds may vary from those detailed in these examples. The concentrations and ratios may also vary under different test conditions or with different test methods.<br>
One measure of synergy is the industrially accepted method described by Kull, F.C.; Eisman, P.C.; Sylwestrowicz, H.D. and Mayer, R.L., in Applied Microbiology 9:538-541 (1961), using the ratio determined by the formula:<br>
QVQA + QVQB = Synergy Index ("SI") wherein:<br>
QA = concentration of compound A (first component) in ppm, acting alone, which<br>
produced an end point (MIC of Compound A). Qa = concentration of compound A in ppm, in the mixture, which produced an end<br>
point. QB = concentration of compound B (second component) in ppm, acting alone, which<br>
produced an end point (MIC of Compound B). Qb = concentration of compound B in ppm, in the mixture, which produced an end<br>
point. When the sum of Qa/QA and Qb/Qs is greater than one, antagonism is indicated. When the sum is equal to one, additivity is indicated, and when less than one, synergy is demonstrated. The lower the SI, the greater is the synergy shown by that particular mixture. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a microbicide is the lowest concentration tested under a specific set of conditions that prevents the growth of the tested microorganisms.<br>
Synergy tests were conducted using standard microtiter plate assays with media designed for optimal growth of the test microorganism. Minimal salt medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.1% yeast extract (M9GY medium) was used for testing bacteria; Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB medium) was used for testing yeast and mold. In this method, a wide range of combinations of microbicides and other personal care raw materials was<br>
tested by conducting high resolution MIC assays in the presence of various concentrations of MIT, or BIT. High resolution MICs were determined by adding varying amounts of microbicide to one column of a microtitre plate and doing subsequent ten-fold dilutions using an automated liquid handling system to obtain a series of endpoints ranging from 2 ppm to 10,000 ppm active ingredient.<br>
The synergy of the combinations of the present invention was determined against a bacterium, Escherichia coli (E. coli - ATCC #8739), and/or a yeast, Candida albicans (C. albicans - ATCC 10231), and/or a mold, Aspergillus niger {A. niger - ATCC 16404). The bacteria were used at a concentration of about 5 x 106 bacteria per mL and the yeast and mold at 5 x 10 fungi per mL. These microorganisms are representative of natural contaminants in many consumer and industrial applications. The plates were visually evaluated for microbial growth (turbidity) to determine the MIC after various incubation times at 25Â° C (yeast and mold) or 30Â° C (bacteria).<br>
The test results for demonstration of synergy of the MIT combinations of the present invention are shown below in Tables 1 through 10. In each test, First Component (A) was MIT and the Second Component (B) was the other microbicide, formulation ingredient, or raw material. Each table shows the specific combinations of MIT and the second component; results against the microorganisms tested with incubation times; the end-point activity in ppm measured by the MIC for MIT alone (QA), for the second component alone (QB), for MIT in the mixture (Qa) and for second component in the mixture (Qb); the calculated SI value; and the range of synergistic ratios for each combination tested (MIT/second component or A/B) against the particular microorganism.<br>
Similar test results for demonstration of synergy of the BIT combinations of the present invention are shown below in Tables 11 through 23.<br>
In each of the comparisons, the effective synergistic ratio may vary among the microorganisms tested and the various combinations of components A and B. Data in the tables below include the range of ratios that were found to be synergistic. (Data which were collected outside of the synergistic ranges are not reported.) These data demonstrate that certain combinations of components A and B show enhanced control over the microorganisms than would be expected if the combinations were additive rather than synergistic.<br>

Using test methods similar to those described above, no synergy was found in comparative combinations of MIT with capric acid, calcium gluconate, etidronic acid, gluconic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, magnesium citrate, or succinic acid. No synergy was found in combinations of BIT with calcium gluconate, lactobionic acid, lauric acid,<br>
magnesium citrate, or succinic acid. These results support the unexpected synergy in the<br>
claimed compositions.<br>
Furthermore, in earlier studies, MIT was tested in combination with other biocides against various organisms, including P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, S. aureus, A. niger and E. Coli. The results showed that there was no synergistic interaction against at least some of the organisms tested for MIT combinations with benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, butylene glycol, citric acid, DMDMH, EDDS, IPBC, hexylene glycol, pentylene glycol, propylparaben, sorbic acid, DBDCB or zinc pyrithione. In addition, other earlier synergy studies were conducted with MIT in combination with a range of commercial biocides, which ultimately led to combinations claimed in US Patent No. 5489588. Under the conditions of those studies, conducted against E. coli and. C. albicans, seven MIT combinations were found to be synergistic  p-chloro-m-xylenol, sodium dichlorophene, bis-(2-hydroxy-5-chlorophenyl)sulfide, benzylbromoacetate, dodecylamine, 4-(2-nitrobutyl)morpholine, and dipropylamine ether. However, twenty-nine additional combinations with MIT were tested and were not synergistic against these two microbes: 4,4-dimethyloxazolidine, 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitro-l,3-propanediol, N- methylolchloroacetamide,2,2-dibromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide (however, in subsequent testing using different microbes and test conditions, this combination was found to be synergistic), bromonitrostyrene, glutaraldehyde, 2-(hydroxymethyl)aminoethanol, 2-(hydroxymethyl)amino'2-methylpropanol, polytoxy-ethylenedimethyliminoethylene dimethyliminoethylene)chloride], benzoylchloroformaldoxime, l,2-dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane, 2-thiocyanomethylthiobendazole, N,N'-dihydroxymethyl-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin, hexahydro-l,3,5-(2-hydroxyethyl)triazine, hexahydro-l,3,5-triethyl-s-triazine, bis-(trichloromethyl)sulfone, blend of bis-(tributyltin)oxide/2-(hydroxymethyl)aminoethanol, bis-(tributyltin)oxide, imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, N.N-dimethyl-N'-phenyl-N'-<br>
(fluorodichloromethylthio)sulfamide, cis 1 -(3-chloroallyl) -3,5,7-triaza-1 -azoniaadamantane chloride, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulfone, 2,4-dichlorobenzylalcohol, didodecyldimethylammonium chloride, methylene-b-thiocyanate, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-l,3"diol, bis-(2"hydroxy-5-<br>
chlorophenyl)sulfide, 5-bromo-5-nitro-l,3-dioxane, and 3-iodo-2-opynylbutylcarbamate.   One skilled in the art of biocide development and testing would have been aware of similar results from testing other biocide combinations and would not have expected that any particular combination of biocides could be predicted to exhibit a synergistic interaction.<br>
