				<td>ENEMA SYSTEM FOR CLEANSING COLON FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an enema system for cleansing colon having a tip in the form of a plunger head that can be removed from the tubular portion of the device. The tip is sized and made of such a material that it does not cause any pain or irritation during insertion. Also the tip has a rounded surface to facilitate a smooth entry of the device in the anal orifice. The device has a locking system to prevent backflow of the liquid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are different types of enema devices available in the market for different applications e.g., air enema, steam enema, smoke enema, and liquid enema. There are five basic forms of liquid :<br>
a.	evacuation enema (to evacuate the bowls<br>
b.	medication enema (to deliver medication)<br>
c.	The purgative enema (to cleanse the body generally)<br>
d.	The re-absorption enema (to deliver nourishment)<br>
e.	Drug enema (to deliver analgesics)<br>
Enema equipment is classified into hand pressed type and syringe type. Among all the automatic flowing type is deemed to be most popular type. However such a type has to be in operation hung on a support and must have a special container as a result of pressure in the rectum. The washing water is often difficult to flow in the rectum. The hand pressed type is considered to be the reliable type but it takes time and manpower to operate and therefore it is used as a spare device. The disadvantage of the syringe type enema device is that it can not be used by the user himself.<br>
RU 2002377 describes enema device having tip made in the form of pipe. Tip has its free end device for removable connection fluid medium source. Tip working end is sized so as to press it to perineum surface around anal orifice and is made with rounded edges. Enema of such construction is particularly useful for those suffering hemorrhoid.<br>
JP 10080481 describes an enema device which does not act an excess pressure on the inside of the anus and has high safety by providing the device with a contrast medium supply device which supplies contrast media between a holding vessel and the inside of the anus via a contrast medium supply pipe and a catheter by squeezing this contrast medium supply pipe in its axial direction. The barium holding vessel is inserted into the holder of an enema machine body and an air supply pipe is connected to the body and is detained by a clip thereafter, a supply/discharge pipe is pressed to the upper part of a rotating body. A pipe retainer is detained by a stopper. Next, the supply/discharge pipe and the air supply pipe are connected to the catheter and a power source switch is turned on. A barium injection switch is kept pressed to send the barium to the front end of the catheter. Next, the front end is inserted into the anus to a position shown by a mark and, thereafter, air is supplied to expand a detaining bag to detain the catheter. When the barium injection switch is pushed, the supply/discharge pipe is squeezed by a roller, by which the barium is delivered at a fixed speed to the catheter side and to supply the barium into the anus<br>
JP 2002078794 describes an enemator which is capable of stopping liquid to the spout at the tip of an insertion portion, hygienically maintaining the entire part of the insertion portion and eliminating the pain which occurs during insertion. The enemator consists of a housing device section which houses a liquid enema and the long-sized insertion portion having the spout at its tip. A lubricant is applied onto the lateral peripheral surface of the insertion portion and the surface coated with the lubricant and spout of the insertion portion are coated by a sealing member.<br>
WO 9614888 describes a cylindrical-shaped insert comprising an irrigation nipple on a side thereof and a suction nipple at one end thereof, and is diverged at the other end thereof which is to be inserted into an anus. An enema liquid nozzle is inserted into the insert through the irrigation nipple. The enema liquid nozzle is supplied with an enema liquid by an enema liquid pump through an enema liquid tube. The enema liquid nozzle is capable of jetting the enema liquid in all directions. The suction nipple is connected to a storage vessel through a suction tube. Excrements are drawn toward a diverged end of the insert by a negative pressure produced by a suction pump and are crushed by the enema liquid jetted from the enema liquid nozzle . Excrements thus crushed are stored in the storage vessel together with the enema liquid by means of the suction pump<br>
US 2005090786 describes an irrigating device and rectal tip assembly having a dual flex allowing for the safe and non-traumatic insertion and removal of tubing into a body cavity. The dual flex insertion tubing has a flexible part and a rigid base part wherein the soft flexible part provides sufficient play and support when inserting the tubing into a body cavity while the rigid part provides a supporting base for the soft flexible part of the tubing. A first tubular portion has a first flexural modulus wherein said first flexural modulus is sufficiently pliable to allow for repeated non-traumatic insertion and is in communication with a second tubular portion having a second flexural modulus sufficiently rigid to support the first tubular portion but also has a minimum bend radius that allows for sufficient play of the second tubular portion.<br>
US Patent no. 5199945 describes an enema device, in which an electro-motive pump is used for adapting to different water containers, and a power supply unit in the device may be a rectifier or a car power supply; a rubber tube is connected with a rectal pipe or a washing nozzle, which is to be mounted on a stool bag before performing an enema operation<br>
The present invention helps to solve the existing problems and provide a safe, effective, easy to use and economical enema device. The device is good for home use too.<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide an enema device which is safe and easy to use.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to provide an enema device which is economical and effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an enema device which is having a non irritating plunger for insertion of device into anal orifice.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an enema device which is having a lock to prevent backflow of liquid.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to an enema system for cleansing colon comprising a plunger, a tubular portion having a barrel shaped proximal end (4) with a hole (5) in the centre and a lateral inlet projection (8) near the rear (7) end characterized in that the said plunger is to be disposed into the internal bore of the said tubular portion such as to be easily movable therein, a locking portion with a locking system connected to the said tubular portion, an inlet pipe having its one end to be connected laterally to the said tubular portion through inlet projection (8) and an outlet pipe connected to the said locking portion at distal end.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subject invention relates to an enema device having a tip in the form of a plunger head that can be removed from the tubular portion of the device. The tip is sized and made of such a material that it does not cause any pain or irritation during insertion. Also the tip has a rounded surface to facilitate a smooth entry of the device in the anal orifice<br>
Fig. 1 shows the plunger which is to be disposed into the internal bore of the first tubular portion such as to be easily movable therein can be removed after insertion of the enema device. The plunger has a central axis (2) having a plunger head (1) on one side and a loop (3) at the distal end<br>
Fig. 2 shows the tubular portion which is made from the soft, pliable and non irritating material. The body of the tubular portion has a barrel shaped proximal end (4) with a hole (5) to allow the plunger head (1) to fit into it. The other end or the rear (7) of the tubular portion is cylindrical in shape and thicker than the main<br><br>
body (6). A small lateral projection (8) is provided near the rear (7) of the tubular body which is at a specific angle. This projection (8) is provided for connecting the inlet pipe to receive the liquid to be injected in the human body. The inlet pipe (not shown) is connected to the automated pump (not shown) on the other end. A thin holder (15) is provided diagonally opposite to the inlet projection (8).<br>
Fig. 3A shows the locking portion having a locking system in the middle with a outer cylinder (9) and two pipes (11,13) attached at both ends to be connected to the rear (7) of the tubular portion on one side and outlet pipe (not shown) on the other.<br>
Fig 3B shows the cross section of the locking system. The locking system has a movable cup (10) like structure fitted into the cylinder (9) such that the inner cup<br>
(10) can move into clock wise or anti clockwise direction. The inner cup has two holes (12) which are diagonally opposite and are of the same diameter as the diameter of the pipes attached to both ends of the lock.<br>
Fig 4 shows the locking system when the lock is open. The lock is cylindrical in shape having a knob (14) on the top for opening and closing of the lock. When the knob is moved in .clockwise direction the lock is opened and the same can be closed by moving the knob in anti-clockwise direction. The closed lock prevents backflow of the liquid.<br>
Fig, 5 shows the assembled device with the inserted plunger, tubular portion and locking system. The tip is the plunger head (1) which is to be inserted in the anal orifice make easy entry of the tubular portion or rectal introducer.<br>
In operation the plunger is placed into the tubular portion. The said tubular portion is then inserted in the anal orifice. The head (1) of the plunger has a rounded tip which facilitates the smooth entry of the enema device in the human rectum.<br>
The plunger is removed from the tubular portion of the device once the device has entered the rectum. The tubular portion is connected to the locking portion at one end (11). The other end (13) of the locking portion is connected to an outlet pipe. Another pipe having its one end connected to the inlet projection (8) of the tubular portion and the other end attached to the automated pump submerged in the liquid. The pump is kept in the bucket which is filled with the liquid to be injected into the human rectum.<br>
As the pump is switched on, the liquid starts flowing into the human rectum through the tubular portion. During injection of the liquid in the rectum the lock of the lock is kept closed to prevent backflow of the liquid. After the sufficient amount of liquid is injected into the rectum the pump is switched off.<br>
When the patient feels that the urge to release the liquid from the rectum, the lock of the locking tubular portion is opened and the fecal matter is allowed to flow across the device and is collected in the other tub through the outlet pipe attached to the locking tubular portion.<br>
If required the above operation can be repeated 4-5 times.<br>
