The present invention relates to the optimized dressing of Laterite stones md more specifically to a machine for performing this operation.<br>
It is known that from the dressing of laterite stone material it is possible to obtain rough sufaces, in particular with a jagged and irregular edge and often with defects such as marks or cracks. For some applications the laterite are processed superficially" and then converted into requires shape for required purpose.<br>
Obviously from each part it is desirable to obtain the maximum possible number of sections, thereby reducing as far as possible the waste and excess material. For many years it has been (and still continues to be) common practice to use conventional cutters (manual) to perform simultaneously a predetermined number of cuts both in the longitudinal direction and in the transverse direction.<br>
Moreover conventional method used to dress laterite stones are not accrate. The finished surface of the laterite stones are not smooth and more particularly at the edges. As a result the stones with poor surface finish and damages, so it is the need to fill the laterites with cement mortar to overcome the damaged section in the laterite stone and this causes higher degree of wastage of cement mortar. Therefore the problems exists in the conventional process (which is done through manually) is to be rectified. By introducing laterite stone dressing machine the above said problems are solved.<br>
The Laterites consist mainly of the minerals kaolinite, goethite, hematite and gibbsite, which form in the course of weathering. Moreover, many laterites contain quartz as relatively stable relic mineral from the parent rock. The iron oxides goethite and hematite cause the red-brown color of laterites.<br>
The laterite stones are obtained from its quarries and it is cut into required shape. It is verymuch important to cut the stones into equal height at the top and bottom surfaces<br><br>
Description of the prior art:<br>
Laterite is a surface formation in hot and wet tropical areas which is enriched in iron and aluminium and develops by intensive and long lasting weathering of the underlying parent rock. Nearly all kinds of rocks can be deeply decomposed by the action of high rainfall and elevated temperatures. The percolating rain water causes dissolution of primary rock minerals and decrease of easily soluble elements as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and silicon. This gives rise to a residual concentration of more insoluble elements predominantly iron and aluminium.<br>
Laterites consist mainly of the minerals kaolinite, goethite, hematite and gibbsite which form in the course of weathering. Moreover, many laterites contain quartz as relatively stable relic mineral from the parent rock. The iron oxides goethite and hematite cause the red-brown color of laterites.<br>
Laterite covers have mostly a thickness of a few meters but occasionally they can be much thicker. Their formation is favoured by a slight relief which prevents erosion of the surface cover. Laterites occurring in non-tropical areas are products of former geological epochs. Lateritic soils form the uppermost part of the laterite cover; in soil science specific names (oxisol, latosol, ferallitic soil) are given for them.<br>
In geosciences only those weathering products are defined as laterite, which are geochemically - mineralogically most strongly altered. They must be distinguished from less altered saprolite which has often a similar appearance and is also very widespread in tropical areas. Both formations can be classified as residual rocks.<br>
Laterites can be as well soft and friable as firm and physically resistant. Indurated varieties are sometimes cut into blocks and used as brickstones for housebuilding. The term laterite which is derived from the Latin word later = brickstone is given because of this usage. Most of the Khmer temples at Angkor are built<br><br>
with laterite and have survived for over 1000 years. Hardened laterite varieties are also applied for the construction of simple roads (laterite pistes). Nowadays solid lateritic gravel is readily put in aquaria where it favors the growth of tropical plants.<br>
Lateritization is economically most important for the formation of lateritic ore deposits. Bauxite which is an aluminium-rich laterite variety can form from various parent rocks if the drainage is most intensive thus leading to a very strong leaching of silica and equivalent enrichment of aluminium hydroxides above all gibbsite.<br>
Lateritization of ultramafic igneous rocks (serpentinite, dunite, or peridotite containing about 0,2 - 0,3% nickel) often results in a considerable nickel concentration. Two kinds of lateritic nickel ore have to be distinguished; A very iron-rich nickel limonite or nickel oxide ore at the surface contains 1-2% Ni bound in goethite which is highly enriched due to very strong leaching of magnesium and silica. Beneath this zone nickel silicate ore can be formed, frequently containing &gt; 2% Ni that is incorporated in silicate minerals primarily serpentine. In pockets and fissures of the serpentinite rock green garnierite can be present in minor quantities, but with high nickel contents - mostly 20-40%. It is bound in newly formed phyllosilicate minerals. All the nickel in the silicate zone is leached downwards (absolute nickel concentration) from the overlying goethite zone. Absence of this zone is due to erosion.<br>
The coventional method used to dress laterite stones are not accrate.The finished surface of the laterite stones are not smooth and more particularly at the edges. As a result the stones with damages and it is the need to fill the laterites with cement mortars to overcome the damaged section in the laterite stone and this causes higher degree of wastage of cement mortar. Therfore the problems exists in the conventional process which is done through manually is to be rectified. By introducing laterite dressing machine the existing problems are solved.<br><br>
The invention GR1003306 concerns a method for the selective dissolution of nickel and cobalt from laterite ores with the assistance of (a) sulphadisation and (b) oxidative extraction at elevated temperature and pressure. Sulphadisation of the ore takes place in conditions of elevated pressure and temperature in an inert atmosphere. This processing precedes the oxidative extraction during which the nickel and cobalt are selectively dissolved from the nickel-containing laterite, while the dissolution of the iron in the extraction solution is minimized. The stage of sulphadisation of the laterite ore is the main point of the invention and contributes to the increased dissolution of the nickel and cobalt to a significant percentage. The main point of this invention is the sulphadisation of the laterite ore and the subsequent production of a solution of sulphuric acid in situ in sufficient quantity to dissolve the nickel and cobalt contained in the ore.<br>
The invention JP6025770 relates to a thermal upgrading process whereby nickel-containing limonite or limonite/saprolite blends are pelletized with requisite amounts of solid carbon reductant and a sulfure-bearing concentrating agent. The pellets are fed to a reactor where they are gradually heated, causing reduction of the metal values. The reduced pellets are then held in a "metallics growth zone" of the reactor at a temperature high enough to allow for liquid-phase migration of the metallics within the pellets but below the point at which the pellets become sticky. The metallics growth zone is provided with a carefully controlled combustion gas atmosphere equivalent to about 60-65% aeration of partial combustion of natural gas which prevents further reduction or re-oxidation and thus provides a good environment for metallic particle growth. After a sufficient retention time, the pellets are then rapidly cooled to prevent the disproportionate of wastage to magnetite. The cooled pellets are then ground and the magnetic fraction separated<br>
The invention IN183981 concerns a laterite cutting machine where smooth finishing are not obtained particularly at the edges, this is because of the cutter blade movement and its arrangement moreover machine performance is not<br><br>
smooth, these drawbacks are rectified in the present invention by using proper cutting tool and the machine arrangement.<br>
The said invention describes smooth dressing technique using laterite dressing machine. The material usage is reduced, i.e the wastage of concrete mortars are reduced to higher degree.<br>
Forty per cent of construction cost can be saved using it.<br>
With construction costs going up sharply in recent times due to the increase in the price of materials, people are trying to innovate to prevent their budgets from going out of hand.<br>
One way out is to find building materials that cost less but are strong at the same time. Laterite stone is perhaps one such material that is strong and relatively cheap too. One can save up to 40 per cent of construction cost by using laterite stones.<br>
While a brick costs Rs.3.50 a piece, a laterite stone equal to six bricks costs only Rs.8. For the area covered by a laterite stone, the bricks would cost Rs.21 or more.<br>
There is a saving in the cement mix that need be applied to bind the bricks, which means less cement and less sand, both of which are highly priced. The surface area of a bigger stone is smaller than the total area of all the bricks that occupy the same area. The time taken to complete a structure is relatively less too, which in turn saves labour cost.<br>
With machine cut stones available now, workers need not spend time on levelling the stone surface to apply concrete. It is also better to get the machine cut stones<br><br>
transported, since one can get more stones in one load compared to the hand cut ones.<br>
The difficulty<br>
But it is definitely not very easy to get a mason to build a house with laterite stones. Construction was made easy with the easy-to-handle bricks and most of the workers in the construction industry are only used to handling these. It takes a different attitude to get working with laterite.<br>
Handling bricks at the construction site is definitely easier than the heavy laterite stone. Procuring these stones is not very difficult, but one has to know a little about their quality. Only licence holders can provide these stones and the number of such people are few.<br>
Less quarries<br>
Since loading and unloading is hard, it is the people in the rural areas who prefer using the stones, said one of the suppliers of stone. The number of quarries is less too. Good quality stone can be cut only after removing at least two layers of earth. The quality of stone deteriorates if one goes deeper into the layers. A mason used to working with laterite stone says that there is minimum loss to the client.<br>
Summery of the invention:<br>
A laterite dressing machine operated to perform a shaping action of laterite stones characterized that it comprising a cutter unit consisting of two dressing blades where the laterite stones are shaped to accurate dimensions; a chain conveyor where the finished side faces of the laterite stones are loaded; a threaded shaft where the dressing blades are mounted through flanges; a v-belt pulley where the shaft is connected which draws power from power tiller/power source; and a set of pressure wheels which are fitted above the conveyor to hold<br><br>
the stones in their exact position.<br>
The accurate surface finish is achieved by the present method and more particularly at the edges moreover the quantity of concrete usage is reduced to higher degree.<br>
