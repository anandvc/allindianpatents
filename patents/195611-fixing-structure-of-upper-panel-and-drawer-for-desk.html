				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fixing structure of an upper panel and a drawer for a desk. More particularly, it relates to a fixing structure for fixing an upper panel and a drawer to a stand of a desk without using screws and rivets, so that it prevents the drawer from being deformed, shifted or separated from the stand by impact applied to the desk, and comprising slope regulation means installed between the upper panel and the stand for adjusting the degree of slope of the upper panel, so that it is used for various purposes.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Generally, a desk comprises an upper panel providing a working place, a drawer provided under the upper panel and in which books and other items are received, and a stand for supporting the drawer at both sides.<br>
A conventional desk is formed by assembling compartments. In a conventional desk, a drawer having an interior space therein is secured to the bottom of an upper panel made of wood using screws or rivets.<br>
2<br><br>
Since the drawer is fixed to the upper panel by a plurality of screws or rivets, assembling or disassembling work of the desk is complicated and consumes a lot of time. Further, since the bottom surface of the upper panel is usually damaged by such, riveting work the bottom surface of the upper panel cannot be used to replace the upper surface of the panel in the case that the upper surface of the upper panel is damaged.<br>
Accordingly, to solve the problem above, a stand is used. That is, the drawer is simply placed on the stand, and the upper panel is placed on the drawer. The stand is secured to the bottom surface of the upper panel by bolts and nuts.<br>
However, the drawer is not secured to the upper panel and the stand. Accordingly, when an external impact is applied to the desk, the drawer is easily separated from the upper panel and/or the drawer can be broken, and the bolt and nut assembly is loosened, so that the upper panel and the stand may be separated.<br>
Further, since the drawer is made of polyvinyl chloride(PVC) resin, it is easily deformed by climatic changes and the deformed drawer must be replaced with a new one.<br>
Moreover, since the upper panel and the drawer are simultaneously secured to the stand by the bolts and nuts so that the upper panel is orthogonal to the stand, it is impossible to adjust the degree of slope of the upper panel relative to the stand. Accordingly, when a user performs work such as drawing or sketching on the upper panel, he/she further requires an additional drafting desk in which the degree of slope of an upper panel is adjustable.<br>
2A<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Fig. 9 shows a conventional desk is formed by assembling compartments. As shown in Fig. 9, in a conventional desk, a drawer 120 having an interior space 121 therein is secured to the bottom of an upper panel 110 made of wood using screws or rivets.<br>
Since the drawer 120 is fixed to the upper panel 110 by a plurality of screws or rivets, assembling or disassembling work of the desk is complicated and consumes a lot of time. Further, since the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 is usually damaged by such, riveting work the bottom surface of the upper panel cannot be used to replace the upper surface of the panel in the case that the upper surface of the upper panel is damaged.<br>
Accordingly, to solve the problem above, a stand 130 is used,. That is, the drawer 120 is simply placed on the stand 130, and the upper panel 110 is placed on the drawer 120; The stand 130 is secured to the bottom surface of the upper panel 110 by bolts and nuts.<br>
However, the drawer 120 is not secured to the upper panel 110 and the stand 130. Accordingly, when an external impact is applied to the desk, the drawer 120 is easily separated from the upper panel 110 and/or the drawer 120 can be broken, and the bolt and nut assembly<br>
5<br><br>
is loosened, so that the upper panel 110 and the stand 130 may be separated.<br>
Further, since the drawer is made of polyvinyl chloride(PVC) resin, it is easily deformed by climatic changes and the deformed drawer must be replaced with a new one.<br>
Moreover, since the upper panel 110 and the drawer 120 are simultaneously secured to the stand 130 by the bolts and nuts so that the upper panel 110 is orthogonal to the stand 130, it is impossible to adjust the degree of slope of the upper panel 110 relative to the stand 130. Accordingly, when a user performs work such as drawing or sketching on the upper panel, he/she further requires an additional drafting desk in which the degree of slope of an upper panel is adjustable.<br>

The upper panel 110 has a rectangular shape, and includes three through holes 111 at both sides. A supporting protuberance 112 is formed on front side of the upper panel 110, thus preventing the things laid on the upper panel 110 from sliding off when the upper panel 110 is sloped at a designated angle.<br>
The drawer 120 includes a plurality of grooves 3 formed at the bottom surface thereof. A fixing bar 1 is provided to outwardly extend along upper edge portions of the drawer 120. The fixing bar 1 has a plurality of insertion holes 11 penetrating therethrough from its upper surface to its lower surface. The fixing bar 1 further has an insertion groove 12 on the bottom thereof so that the intermediate frame 2 is inserted into the insertion groove 12. The insertion groove 12 is provided with a plurality of fixing protrusions 12a for holding and fixing the intermediate frame 2. The drawer 120 having a complicated structure described above may be formed by an injection molding method.<br>
The intermediate frame 2 is formed in such a manner as to fit into the insertion groove 12 of the fixing member 1, and has a plurality of connection holes 22 formed to correspond to the insertion holes 11. A hook 23 is provided at the bottom of the intermediate frame 2 between adjacent connection holes 22.<br>
The stand 130 includes an extending portion 132 and a supporting portion 134. The extending portion 132 is extended from the bottom surface of the intermediate frame 2 and formed to have a hollow structure. The extending potion 132 is<br>
7<br><br>
provided with a plurality of connection holes formed perpendicularly to the external surface thereof. The supporting portion 134 is slidably inserted into the extending portion 132 and placed on the ground for supporting an intermediate frame 2. The supporting portion 134 is provided with a plurality of holes at the upper portion thereof so that the holes of the supporting portions 134 correspond to the connection holes of the extending portion 132.
