				<td>HEAT TRANSFER TUBE AND METHOD OF AND TOOL FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a heat transfer tube having protrusions on the inner<br>
surface of the tube and a method of and tool for forming the protrusions on the inner<br>
surface of the tube.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a heat transfer tube having an enhanced inner surface to<br>
facilitate heat transfer from one side of the tube to the other. Heat transfer tubes are<br>
commonly used in equipment, such as, for example, flooded evaporators, falling film<br>
evaporators, spray evaporators, absorption chillers, condensers, direct expansion coolers,<br>
and single phase coolers and heaters, used in the refrigeration, chemical, petrochemical,<br>
and food-processing industries. A variety of heat transfer mediums may be used in these<br>
applications, including, but not limited to, pure water, a water glycol mixture, any type of<br>
refrigerant (such as R-22, R-134a, R-123, etc.), ammonia, petrochemical fluids, and other<br>
mixtures.<br>
An ideal heat transfer tube would allow heat to flow completely uninhibited from<br>
the interior of the tube to the exterior of the tube and vice versa. However, such free flow<br>
of heat across the tube is generally thwarted by the resistance to heat transfer. The overall<br>
resistance of the tube to heat transfer is calculated by adding the individual resistances<br>
from the outside to the inside of the tube or vice versa. To improve the heat transfer<br>
efficiency of the tube, tube manufacturers have striven to uncover ways to reduce the<br>
overall resistance of the tube. One such way is to enhance the outer surface of the tube,<br>
such as by forming fins on the outer surface. As a result of recent advances in enhancing<br><br>
the outer tube surface (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,697,430 and 5,996,686), only a small<br>
part of the overall tube resistance is attributable to the outside of the tube. For example, a<br>
typical evaporator tube used in a flooded chiller with an enhanced outer surface but<br>
smooth inner surface typically has a 10:1 inner resistance:outer resistance ratio. Ideally,<br>
one wants to obtain an inside to outside resistance ratio of 1:1. It becomes all the more<br>
important, therefore, to develop enhancements to the inner surface of the tube that will<br>
significantly reduce the tube side resistance and improve overall heat transfer<br>
performance of the tube.<br>
It is known to provide heat transfer tubes with alternating grooves and ridges on<br>
their inner surfaces. The grooves and ridges cooperate to enhance turbulence of fluid heat<br>
transfer mediums, such as water, delivered within the tube. This turbulence increases the<br>
fluid mixing close to the inner tube surface to reduce or virtually eliminate the boundary<br>
layer build-up of the fluid medium close to the inner surface of the tube. The boundary<br>
layer thermal resistance significantly detracts from heat transfer performance by<br>
increasing the heat transfer resistance of the tube. The grooves and ridges also provide<br>
extra surface area for additional heat exchange. This basic premise is taught in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,847,212 to Withers, Jr. et al.<br>
The pattern, shapes and sizes of the grooves and ridges on the inner tube surface<br>
may be changed to further increase heat exchange performance. To that end, tube<br>
manufacturers have gone to great expense to experiment with alternative designs,<br>
including those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,791,405 to Takima et al., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,332,034 and 5,458,191 to Chiang et al., and U.S. Patent No. 5,975,196 to Gaffaney et<br>
al.<br><br>
In general, however, enhancing the inner surface of the tube has proven much<br>
more difficult than the outer surface. Moreover, the majority of enhancements on both<br>
the outer and inner surface of tubes are formed by molding and shaping the surfaces.<br>
Enhancements have been formed, however, by cutting the tube surfaces.<br>
Japanese Patent Application 09108759 discloses a tool for centering blades that<br>
cut a continuous spiral groove directly on the inner surface of a tube. Similarly, Japanese<br>
Patent Application 10281676 discloses a tube expanding plug equipped with cutting tools<br>
that cut a continuous spiral slot and upstanding fin on the inner surface of a tube. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,753,364 discloses forming a continuous groove along the inner surface of a<br>
tube using a cutting tool that cuts into the inner tube surface and folds the material<br>
upwardly to form the continuous groove.<br>
While all of these inner surface tube designs aim to improve the heat transfer<br>
performance of the tube, there remains a need in the industry to continue to improve upon<br>
tube designs by modifying existing and creating new designs that enhance heat transfer<br>
performance. Additionally, a need also exists to create designs and patterns that can be<br>
transferred onto the tubes more quickly and cost-effectively. As described hereinbelow,<br>
applicants have developed new geometries for heat transfer tubes as well as tools to form<br>
these geometries, and, as a result, have significantly improved heat transfer performance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention provides an improved heat transfer tube surface and a method of<br>
formation thereof that can be used to enhance heat transfer performance of tubes used in<br>
at least all of the above-referenced applications (i.e., flooded evaporators, falling film<br>
evaporators, spray evaporators, absorption chillers, condensers, direct expansion coolers,<br>
and single phase coolers and heaters, used in the refrigeration, chemical, petrochemical,<br><br>
and food-processing industries). The inner surface of the tube is enhanced with a<br>
plurality of protrusions that significantly reduce tube side resistance and improve overall<br>
heat transfer performance. The protrusions create additional paths for fluid flow within<br>
the tube and thereby enhance turbulence of heat transfer mediums flowing within the<br>
tube. This increases fluid mixing to reduce the boundary layer build-up of the fluid<br>
medium close to the inner surface of the tube, such build-up increasing the resistance and<br>
thereby impeding heat transfer. The protrusions also provide extra surface area for<br>
additional heat exchange. Formation of the protrusions in accordance with this invention<br>
can result in the formation of up to five times more surface area along the inner surface of<br>
the tube than with simple ridges. Tests show that the performance of tubes having the<br>
protrusions of this invention is significantly enhanced.<br>
The method of this invention includes using a tool, which can easily be added to<br>
existing manufacturing equipment, having a cutting edge to cut through ridges on the<br>
inner surface of the tube to create ridge layers and a lifting edge to lift the ridge layers to<br>
form the protrusions. In this way, the protrusions are formed without removal of metal<br>
from the inner surface of the tube, thereby eliminating debris which can damage the<br>
equipment in which the tubes are used. The protrusions on the inner surface of the tube<br>
can be formed in the same or a different operation as formation of the ridges.<br>
Tubes formed in accordance with this application may be suitable in any number<br>
of applications, including, for example, applications for use in the HVAC, refrigeration,<br>
chemical, petrochemical, and food-processing industries. The physical geometries of the<br>
protrusions may be changed to tailor the tube to a particular application and fluid<br>
medium.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide improved heat transfer tubes.<br><br>
It is another object of this invention to provide an improved heat transfer tube<br>
having protrusions on its inner surface.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method of forming an<br>
improved heat transfer tube having protrusions on its inner surface.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide an innovative tool for forming<br>
improved heat transfer tubes.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to provide a tool for forming protrusions<br>
on the inner surface of heat transfer tubes.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
FIGS, la-e show the partially-formed inner surface 18 of one embodiment of the<br>
tube 21 of this invention. Inner surface 18 includes a plurality of protrusions 2.<br>
Protrusions 2 are formed from ridges 1 formed on inner surface 18. Ridges 1 are first<br>
formed on inner surface 18. The ridges 1 are then cut to create ridge layers 4, which are<br>
subsequently lifted up to form protrusions 2 (best seen in FIGS, la and lb). This cutting<br>
and lifting can be, but does not have to be, accomplished using tool 13, shown in FIGS.<br>
6a-d and 7a-d and described below.<br><br>
It should be understood that a tube in accordance with this invention is generally<br>
useful in, but not limited to, any application where heat needs to be transferred from one<br>
side of the tube to the other side of the tube, such as in single-phase and multi-phase (both<br>
pure liquids or gases or liquid/gas mixtures) evaporators and condensers. While the<br>
following discussion provides desirable dimensions for a tube of this invention, the tubes<br>
of this invention are in no way intended to be limited to those dimensions. Rather, the<br>
desirable geometries of the tube, including protrusions 2, will depend on many factors,<br>
not the least important of which are the properties of the fluid flowing through the tube.<br>
One skilled in the art would understand how to alter the geometry of the inner surface of<br>
the tube, including the geometry of ridges 1 and protrusion 2, to maximize the heat<br>
transfer of the tube used in various applications and with various fluids.<br>
Ridges 1 are formed on inner surface 18 at a helix angle a to the axis s of the tube<br>
(see FIGS, la and le). Helix angle a may be any angle between 0°-90°, but preferably<br>
does not exceed 70°. One skilled in the art will readily understand that the preferred helix<br>
angle a will often depend, at least in part, on the fluid medium used. The height er of<br>
ridges 1 should generally be greater the more viscous the liquid flowing through tube 21.<br>
For example, a height er of greater than zero (preferably, but not necessarily, at least<br>
0.001 inches) up to 25% of the inside diameter of the tube (Dj) will generally be desirable<br>
in a tube sample used with a water/glycol mixture for low temperature applications. For<br>
purposes of this application, Di is the inside diameter of tube 21 measured from inner<br>
surface 18 of tube 21. The axial pitch P of ridges 1 depends on many factors, including<br>
helix angle a, the number of ridges 1 formed on inner surface 18 of tube 21, and the<br>
inside diameter D of tube 21. While any pitch  may be used, the ratio of  is<br>
preferably at least 0.002, and the ratio of  is preferably between approximately 0.001-<br><br>
0.25. Again, however, one skilled in the art will readily understand that these preferred<br>
ratio values will often depend, at least in part, on the fluid medium used and operating<br>
conditions (e.g., the temperature of the fluid medium).<br>
Ridge layers 4 are cut at an angle 0 to axis s that is preferably between<br>
approximately 20°-50°, inclusive, and more preferably around 30°. The axial pitch   of<br>
protrusions 2 may be any value greater than zero and generally will depend on, among<br>
other factors, the relative revolutions per minute between the tool (discussed below) and<br>
the tube during manufacture, the relative axial feed rate between the tool and the tube<br>
during manufacture, and the number of tips provided on the tool used to form the<br>
protrusions during manufacture. While the resulting protrusions 2 can have any thickness<br>
SPi the thickness Sp is preferably approximately 20-100% of pitch Pap. The height ep of<br>
protrusions 2 is dependent on the cutting depth t (as seen in FIGS, lb, 8a, and 8b) and<br>
angle 0 at which the ridge layers 4 are cut. The height ep of protrusions 2 is preferably a<br>
value at least as great as the cutting depth t up to three times the cutting depth t It is<br>
preferable, but not necessary, to form ridges 1 at a height erand set the cutting angle 0 at a<br>
value that will result in the height ep of protrusions 2 being at least approximately double<br>
the height   of ridges 1. Thus, the ratio  is preferably between approximately<br>
0.002-0.5 (i.e.,  is double the preferred range of the ratio  of approximately<br>
0.001-0.25).<br>
FIGS, la and lb show cutting depth t equal to the height erof ridges 1 so that the<br>
base 40 of protrusion 2 is located on the inner surface 18 of tube 21. The cutting depth t<br>
need not be equal to the ridge height e, however. Rather, the ridges 1 can be cut only<br>
partially through ridges 1 (see FIG. 8a) or beyond the height of ridges 1 and into tube wall<br>
3 (see FIG. 8b). In FIG. 8a, the ridges 1 are not cut through their entire height e,.so that<br><br>
the base 40 of protrusions 2 is positioned further from the inner surface 18 of tube 21 than<br>
the base 42 of ridges 1, which is located on the inner surface 18. In contrast, FIG. 8b<br>
illustrates a cutting depth t of beyond the ridge height e„ so that at least one wall of the<br>
protrusions 2 extends into tube wall 3, beyond the inner surface 18 and ridge base 42.<br>
When ridge layers 4 are lifted, grooves 20 are formed between adjacent<br>
protrusions 2. Ridge layers 4 are cut and lifted so that grooves 20 are oriented on inner<br>
surface 18 at an angle T to the axis s of tube 21 (see FIGS, le, 1 la, and 1 lb), which is<br>
preferably, but does not have to be, between approximately 80°-100°.<br>
The shape of protrusions 2 is dependent on the shape of ridges 1 and the<br>
orientation of ridges 1 relative to the direction of movement of tool 13. In the<br>
embodiment of FIGS, la-e, protrusions 2 have four side surfaces 25, a sloped top surface<br>
26 (which helps decrease resistance to heat transfer), and a substantially pointed tip 28.<br>
The protrusions 2 of this invention are in no way intended to be limited to this illustrated<br>
embodiment, however, but rather can be formed in any shape. Moreover, protrusions 2 in<br>
tube 21 need not all be the same shape or have the same geometry.<br>
Whether the orientation of protrusions 2 is straight (see FIG. 10a) or bent or<br>
twisted (see FIG. 10b) depends on the angle p formed between ridges 1 and the direction<br>
of movement g of tool 13. If angle p is less than 90°, protrusions 2 will have a relatively<br>
straight orientation, such as is shown in FIG. 10a. If angle p is more than 90°, protrusions<br>
2 will have a more bent and/or twisted orientation, such as, for example, is shown in FIG.<br>
10b.<br>
During manufacture of tube 21, tool 13 maybe used to cut through ridges 1 and<br>
lift the resulting ridge layers 4 to form protrusions 2. Other devices and methods for<br>
forming protrusions 2 may be used, however. Tool 13 can be made from any material<br><br>
having the structural integrity to withstand metal cutting (e.g. steel, carbide, ceramic,<br>
etc.), but is preferably made of a carbide. The embodiments of the tool 13 shown in<br>
FIGS. 6a-d and 7a-d generally have a tool axis q, two base walls 30, 32 and one or more<br>
side walls 34. Aperture 16 is located through the tool 13. Tips 12 are formed on side<br>
walls 34 of tool 13. Note, however, that the tips can be mounted or formed on any<br>
structure that can support the tips in the desired orientation relative to the tube 21 and<br>
such structure is not limited to that disclosed in FIGS. 6a-d and 7a-d. Moreover, the tips<br>
may be retractable within their supporting structure so that the number of tips used in the<br>
cutting process can easily be varied.<br>
FIGS. 6a-d illustrate one embodiment of tool 13 having a single tip 12. FIGS. 7a-<br>
d illustrate an alternative embodiment of tool 13 having four tips 12. One skilled in the<br>
art will understand mat tool 13 may be equipped with any number of tips 12 depending on<br>
the desired pitch P,iP of protrusions 2. Moreover, the geometry of each tip need not be the<br>
same for tips on a single tool 13. Rather, tips 12 having different geometries to form<br>
protrusions having different shapes, orientations, and other geometries maybe provided<br>
on tool 13.<br>
Each tip 12 is formed by the intersection of planes A, B, and C The intersection<br>
of planes A and B form cutting edge 14 that cuts through ridges 1 to form ridge layers 4.<br>
Plane B is oriented at an angle <p relative to a plane perpendicular the tool axis q></p>
FIG. 6b). Angle q&gt; is defined as 90° - 9. Thus, angle (p is preferably between<br>
approximately 40°-70° to allow cutting edge 14 to slice through ridges 1 at the desirable<br>
angle 0 between approximately 20°-50°.<br>
The intersection of planes A and C form lifting edge 15 that lifts ridge layers 4<br>
upwardly to form protrusions 2. Angle (pi_ defined by plane C and a plane perpendicular<br><br>
to tool axis q, determines the angle of inclination © (the angle between a plane<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis s of tube 21 and the longitudinal axis of protrusions<br>
2 (see FIG. 1c)) at which protrusions 2 are lifted by lifting edge 15. Angle  = angle <br>
and thus angle  on tool 13 can be adjusted to directly impact the angle of inclination 00<br>
of protrusions 2. The angle of inclination 00 (and angle  is preferably the absolute<br>
value of any angle between approximately -45° to 45° relative to the plane perpendicular<br>
to the longitudinal axis s of tube 21. In this way, protrusions can be aligned with the<br>
plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis s of tube 21 (see FIG. lb) or incline to the left<br>
and right relative to the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis s of tube 21 (see FIG.<br>
lc). Moreover, the tips 12 can be formed to have different geometries (i.e., angle  may<br>
be different on different tips), and thus the protrusions 2 within tube 21 may incline at<br>
different angles (or not at all) and in different directions relative to the plane<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis s of tube 21.<br>
While preferred ranges of values for the physical dimensions of protrusions 2 have<br>
been identified, one skilled in the art will recognize that the physical dimensions of tool<br>
13 may be modified to impact the physical dimensions of resulting protrusions 2. For<br>
example, the depth t that cutting edge 14 cuts into ridges 1 and angle  affect the height ep<br>
of protrusions 2. Therefore, the height ep of protrusions 2 may be adjusted using the<br>
expression<br><br><br><br>
FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate one possible manufacturing set-up for enhancing the<br>
surfaces of tube 21. These figures are in no way intended to limit the process by which<br>
tubes in accordance with this invention are manufactured, but rather any tube<br>
manufacturing process using any suitable equipment or configuration of equipment may<br>
be used. The tubes of this invention may be made from a variety of materials possessing<br>
suitable physical properties including structural integrity, malleability, and plasticity, such<br>
as, for example, copper and copper alloys, aluminum and aluminum alloys, brass,<br>
titanium, steel, and stainless steel. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate three arbors 10 operating on<br>
tube 21 to enhance the outer surface of tube 21. Note that one of the arbors 10 has been<br>
omitted from FIG. 4. Each arbor 10 includes a tool set-up having finning disks 7 which<br><br>
radially extrude from one to multiple start outside fins 6 having axial pitch  The tool<br>
set-up may include additional disks, such as notching or flattening disks, to further<br>
enhance the outer surface of tube 21. Moreover, while only three arbors 10 are shown,<br>
fewer or more arbors may be used depending on the desired outer surface enhancements.<br>
Note, however, that depending on the tube application, enhancements need not be<br>
provided on the outer surface of tube 21 at all.<br>
In one example of a way to enhance inner surface 18 of tube 21, a mandrel shaft<br>
11 onto which mandrel 9 is rotatably mounted extends into tube 21. Tool 13 is mounted<br>
onto shaft 11 through aperture 16. Bolt 24 secures tool 13 in place. Tool 13 is preferably<br>
locked in rotation with shaft 11 by any suitable means. FIGS. 6d and 7d illustrate a key<br>
groove 17 that may be provided on tool 13 to interlock with a protrusion on shaft 11 (not<br>
shown) to fix tool 13 in place relative to shaft 11.<br>
In operation, tube 21 generally rotates as it moves through the manufacturing<br>
process. Tube wall 3 moves between mandrel 9 and finning disks 7, which exert pressure<br>
on tube wall 3. Under pressure, the metal of tube wall 3 flows into the grooves between<br>
the finning disks 7 to form fins 6 on the exterior surface of tube 21.<br>
The mirror image of a desired inner surface pattern is provided on mandrel 9 so<br>
that mandrel 9 will form inner surface 18 of tube 21 with the desired pattern as tube 21<br>
engages mandrel 9. A desirable inner surface pattern includes ridges 1, as shown in<br>
FIGS, la and 4. After formation of ridges 1 on inner surface 18 of tube 21, tube 21<br>
encounters tool 13 positioned adjacent and downstream mandrel 9. As explained<br>
previously, the cutting edge(s) 14 of tool 13 cuts through ridges 1 to form ridge layers 4.<br>
Lifting edge(s) 15 of tool 13 then lift ridge layers 4 to form protrusions 2.<br><br>
When protrusions 2 are formed simultaneously with outside finning and tool 13 is<br>
fixed (i.e., not rotating or moving axially), tube 21 automatically rotates and has an axial<br>
movement hi this instance, the axial pitch of protrusions Pap is governed by the<br>
following formula:<br><br>
Where:<br>
Po is the axial pitch of outside fins 6;<br>
Z0 is the number of fin starts on the outer diameter of tube 21;<br>
and<br>
Zi is the number of tips 12 on tool 13.<br>
To obtain a specific protrusion axial pitch Pp, tool 13 can also be rotated. Both<br>
tube 21 and tool 13 can rotate in the same direction or, alternatively, both tube 21 and tool<br>
13 can rotate, but in opposite directions. To obtain a predetermined axial protrusion pitch<br>
Pp, the necessary rotation (in revolutions per minute (RPM)) of the tool 13 can be<br>
calculated using the following formula:<br><br><br>
If the result of this calculation is negative, then tool 13 should rotate in the same<br>
direction of tube 21 to obtain the desired pitch Pp. Alternatively, if the result of this<br>
calculation is positive, then tool 13 should rotate in the opposite direction of tube 21 to<br>
obtain the desired pitch P.<br>
Note that while formation of protrusions 2 is shown in the same operation as<br>
formation of ridges 1, protrusions 2 may be produced in a separate operation from finning<br>
using a tube with pre-formed inner ridges 1. This would generally require an assembly to<br>
rotate tool 13 or tube 21 and to move tool 13 or tube 21 along the tube axis. Moreover, a<br>
support is preferably provided to center tool 13 relative to the inner tube surface 18.<br>
In this case, the axial pitch P of protrusions 2 is governed by the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
This formula is suitable when (1) the tube moves only axially (i.e., does not rotate)<br>
and the tool only rotates (i.e., does not move axially); (2) the tube only rotates and the<br>
tool moves only axially; (3) the tool rotates and moves axially but the tube is both<br>
rotationally and axially fixed; (4) the tube rotates and moves axially but the tool is both<br>
rotationally and axially fixed; and (5) any combination of the above.<br>
With the inner tube surface of this invention, additional paths for fluid flow are<br>
created (between protrusions 2 through grooves 20) to optimize heat transfer and pressure<br><br>
drop. FIG. 9a illustrates these additional paths 22 for fluid travel through tube 21. These<br>
paths 22 are in addition to fluid flow paths 23 created between ridges 1. These additional<br>
paths 22 have a helix angle α1 relative to the tube axis s. Angle α1 is the angle between<br>
protrusions 2 formed from adjacent ridges 1. FIG. 9b clearly shows these additional paths<br>
22 formed between protrusions 2. Helix angle α1 and thus orientation of paths 22<br>
through tube 21, can be adjusted by adjusting pitch P  of protrusions 2 using the<br>
following expression<br><br>
If ridge helix angle a and angle T of grooves 20 are both either right hand or left<br>
hand helix (see FIG. 1 lb), then the "[-]" should be used in the above expression.<br>
Alternatively, if ridge helix angle a and angle T of grooves 20 are opposite hand helix<br>
(see FIG. 1 la), then the "[+]" should be used in the above expression.<br>
Tubes made in accordance with this invention outperform existing tubes. FIGS.<br>
12 and 13 graphically illustrate the enhanced performance of two examples of such tubes<br>
(boiling tubes Tube No. 25 and Tube No. 14) by demonstrating the differences in the<br><br>
enhancement factors between these tubes. The enhancement factor is the factor by which<br>
the heat transfer coefficients (both tube-side (see FIG. 12) and overall (see FIG. 13)) of<br>
these new tubes (Tube No. 25 and Tube No. 14) increase over existing tubes (Turbo-B®,<br>
Turbo-BII, and Turbo B-III). Again, however, Tube Nos. 25 and 14 are merely<br>
examples of tubes in accordance with this invention. Other types of tubes made in<br>
accordance with this invention outperform existing tubes in a variety of applications.<br>
The physical characteristics of the Turbo-B®, Turbo-BD®, and Turbo B-m® tubes<br>
are described in Tables 1 and 2 of U.S. Patent No. 5,697,430 to Thors, et al. Turbo-B® is<br>
referenced as Tube II; Turbo-BII® is referenced as Tube III; and Turbo B-ID® is<br>
referenced as Tube IVH The outside surfaces of Tube No. 25 and Tube No. 14 are<br>
identical to that of Turbo B-III®. The inside surfaces of Tube No. 25 and Tube No. 14 are<br>
in accordance with this invention and include the following physical characteristics:<br><br><br><br>
FIG. 12 shows that the tube-side heat transfer coefficient of Tube No. 14 is<br>
approximately 1.8 times and Tube No. 25 is approximately 1.3 times that of Turbo B-III®,<br>
which is currently the most popular tube used in evaporator applications and shown as a<br><br>
baseline in FIGS. 12 and 13. Similarly, FIG. 13 shows that the overall heat transfer<br>
coefficient of Tube No. 25 is approximately 1.25 times and Tube No. 14 is approximately<br>
1.5 times mat of Turbo B-III®.<br>
The foregoing is provided for purposes of illustrating, exlaining, and describing<br>
embodiments of this invention. Further modifications and adaptations to these<br>
embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without<br>
departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.<br><br>
