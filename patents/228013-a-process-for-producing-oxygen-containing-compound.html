				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing an oxygen-containing compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
An oxygen-containing compound such as an alcohol compound a<br>
ketone compound, an aldehyde compound and a carboxylic acid<br>
compound obtained by oxidizing a methyl or methylene group of an<br>
olefin compound having carbon-carbon double bond which is bonded<br>
to the methyl or methylene group such as a 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl<br>
and 2-methyl- 1-propenyl group (hereinafter simply referred to as<br>
the olefin compound), is very important compound as various<br>
chemicals and synthetic intermediate of them. For example,<br>
3,3-dimethyl-2-E-(2 -carboxy-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic<br>
acid esters obtained by oxidizing a methyl group of<br>
2-methyl-1-propenyl	group	of<br>
3,3-dimethyl-2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid esters is an important chrysanthemic acid derivative as an acid part of household agents for epidemic prevention and insecticides which is known as pyrethrates (e.g. Synthetic Pyrethroid Insecticides: Structure and Properties,3(1990)). E,E-2,6-dimethyl-2,6-octadiene-l,8-diol-8-acetate, which is obtained by oxidizing a terminal methyl group of geranyl acetate, is useful as an intermediate in natural-product synthesis (e.g.<br><br>
Tetrahedron Letters, 4_1. 2205 (2001)).<br>
A methyl or methylene group which is bonded to a carbon-carbon double bond of an olefin compound is the methyl or methylene group at allylic position. As a method for producing an oxygen-containing compound by oxidizing the methyl or methylene group at allylic position, for example, method for reacting the above-mentioned olefin compound with selenium dioxide (e.g. Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, 7., 83(1991) and Proc. Japan Acad. , H, 353 (1956)) and method for reacting an olefin compound with an organic hydroperoxide in the presence of selenium dioxide catalyst (e.g. J. Amer, Chem. Soc, 99, 5526 (1977)) are known. However, in the former method, a large amount of selenium dioxide is used and it is necessary to oxidize the selenium metal again for reuse since they are converted to selenium metal after completion of the reaction. In the latter method, methylene chloride, which has some problems on the occupational safety and health, is used as a solvent and it is difficult to recover and reuse of selenium dioxide catalyst. Neither method was satisfactory industrially.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, an oxygen-containing compound  such  as  a  corresponding  alcohol  compound,  a corresponding aldehyde compound, a corresponding ketone compound, and a corresponding carboxylic acid compound can be obtained by<br><br>
reacting the above-mentioned olefin compound with an organic hydroperoxide using an ionic liquid and a selenium compound to oxidize the methyl or methylene group at allylic position. It is also easy to recover and reuse the ionic liquid and selenium compound. It is industrially advantageous.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a method for producing an oxygen-containing compound, characterized in that an olefin compound having carbon-carbon double bond which is bonded to a methyl or methylene group is reacted with an organic hydroperoxide in the presence of an ionic liquid and a selenium compound.<br>

The amount used of the ionic liquid is not particularly limited and it is usually about 0.1 to 100 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the selenium compound.<br>
The present invention is usually carried out without using a solvent, and may be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Examples of the solvent include, for example, ether solvents such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; ester solvents such as ethyl acetate; alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and tert-butanol; nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; and water. The solvent may be used alone or in the form of a mixture. The amount used of the solvent is not particularly limited.<br><br>
In the present reaction, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an aromatic carboxylic acid to obtain the oxygen-containing compound in better yield. Examples of the aromatic carboxylic acid include, for example, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, picolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and isonicotinic acid. The amount used of the aromatic carboxylic acid is not limited particularly and it is practically 0.1 to 10 moles per 1 mole of the selenium compound.<br>
In the present reaction, the olefin compound, the ionic liquid, the organic hydroperoxide, the selenium compound and if necessary the solvent and/or the aromatic carboxylic acid, may be mixed and the mixing order is not limited particularly. A preferable example of the mixing order is described below. First, the ionic liquid, the selenium compound and a part of the organic hydroperoxide are mixed. In this case, if necessary, the aromatic carboxylic acid may be mixed thereto. Next, the olefin compound is added to the mixture, and then the remaining organic hydroperoxide is added thereto and the resulting mixture is stirred at the reaction temperature to obtain the oxygen-containing compound in good yield.<br>
If the reaction temperature is too low, the reaction hardly proceeds and, if the reaction temperature is too high, side reaction such as polymerization of the starting olefin compound may proceed. Therefore, the practical reaction temperature is<br><br>
in a range of 0 to 200 aC.<br>
The reaction may be carried out under a normal pressure or pressurized condition. The progress of the reaction can be checked by conventional analyzing means such as gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, NMR and IR.<br>
After completion of the reaction, a solvent immiscible with the ionic liquid is added to the reaction mixture as it is or after decomposition of the remaining organic hydroperoxide with a reducing agent such as sodium sulfite if necessary, and the ionic liquid phase and organic phase containing an oxygen-containing compound can be separated. When the aqueous solution is used at the point of the reaction or the aftertreatment with the reducing agent, the reaction mixture is sometimes separated to the three phases of the ionic liquid phase, the organic phase containing oxygen-containing compound and the aqueous phase and in this case each phase may be also separated to obtain the organic phase containing oxygen-containing compound and the ionic liquid phase. The oxygen-containing compound can be isolated by concentrating the obtained organic phase. The isolated oxygen-containing compound may be further purified by a conventional purification means such as distillation or column chromatography.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent immiscible with the ionic liquid include, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as n-pentane, n-hexane and n-heptane, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene and the amount used of the<br><br>
organic solvent is not particularly limited.<br>
The selenium compound or the oxide of the above-mentioned selenium compound is usually contained in the above-mentioned ionic liquid phase and the ionic liquid phase containing the selenium compound or the oxide of the above-mentioned selenium compound, as it is or after conducting concentration treatment if necessary, can be used again in the present reaction. When the ionic liquid phase is used again, new selenium compound may be not used and if necessary, a selenium compound may be used by adding to the ionic liquid phase.<br>
