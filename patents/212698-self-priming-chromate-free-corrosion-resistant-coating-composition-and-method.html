				<td>SELF-PRIMING CHROMATE FREE COROSION<br>
RESISTANT COATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a self-priming coating composition based on a<br>
polymeric material, particularly a vinyl terpolymer of polyvinyl formal,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate with an alkyd co-resin. This coating<br>
composition can be applied on ferrous or non-ferrous metallic substrates.<br>
The rapid curing nature coupled with high flexibility and resistance to wear,<br>
abrasion, corrosion and thermal shocks makes it most ideal for continuous<br>
coil coating lines. This can be formulated both as a clear coat as well as a<br>
pigmented coating in a range of colours in a blend of volatile organic<br>
solvents. It is self-priming in nature and can be applied as a top coat directly<br>
on the metal surface without any primer thereby making the coating method<br>
most cost effective. The absence of any primer helps to avoid toxic<br>
materials, especially chromate salts normally accompanying a primer and<br>
thereby makes the coating environment friendly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pre-coated metals generated in continuous coil coating lines<br>
processing rolled stock such as cold rolled steel, hot dip galvanized steel,<br>
stainless steel, tin plated steel and aluminum, represent a major industrial<br>
activity today. Steel, excluding hot rolled steel, is increasingly being<br>
coated in this manner. The organic products normally employed for this<br>
purpose are based on silicones, polyesters, epoxies, urethanes, acrylics and<br>
combinations thereof, PVC plastisols and fluorocarbons. Most of these<br>
products are solvent based i.e. contain a volatile organic solvent, though<br>
some are also available as powdered resin to be applied as powder coatings.<br>
Invariably these products require their specific primers as these lack the<br>
ability to adhere directly to substrates in the short oven dwell times of<br>
continuous coil coating lines.<br>
Self-priming coating formulations have been generally made based on<br>
alkyds (U.S. Patent No.5,539,032) polyurethanes (U.S Patent Nos.<br>
5,427,821, 5,403,880 and 5,236,983), epoxies (U.S Patent Nos.5,491,185,<br>
5,202,367 and 5,130,361), phenoxy (US Patent No. 5,274,021) and other<br>
resins and combinations thereof. The aforementioned formulations,<br>
however, are meant for structural applications with long curing cycles<br>
where they replace conventional primer plus top coats. Such compositions<br>
are not suited to the intricate and rigorous demands of the continuous coil<br>
coating lines, where coatings ought to harden/cure on the substrate in less<br>
than a minute and should be extremely flexible and scratch resistant so as to<br>
withstand post forming rigors in engineering, appliance and construction<br>
industries. In addition to these properties the coatings should be chemically<br>
resistant and possess good weatherability and aesthetic appeal to function as<br>
a top coat.<br>
The products used for metal pre-coating in continuous coil coating<br>
lines ranging from vinyl plastisols and fluorocarbons to thermosetting resins<br>
as stated in prior art have a limitation in that these do not generally offer a<br>
combination of high scratch hardness with good flexibility. Hardness of the<br>
thennosetting resinous coating depends on the density of cross links of these<br>
resins on cure. As this density increases, the material hardens but begins to<br>
lose its flexibility. Contrarily, a coating that is inherently flexible such as<br>
plastisol, has a low Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) and hardness.<br>
Further, these coatings are also poor in thermal resistance. Therefore such<br>
coatings are unsuitable as abrasion resistant coatings and in applications<br>
requiring high heat resistance. On the other hand, coatings with high surface<br>
hardness normally contain large amounts of inorganic pigments and<br>
additives, mainly zinc and its compounds. Coatings rich in inorganic<br>
content generally demonstrate poor flexibility restricting their use in<br>
applications requiring the ability of coated substrates to withstand forming,<br>
drawing and other related operations.<br>
Another general limitation indicated in prior art is the requirement of<br>
selective primers for the presently used coatings. The primers ordinarily<br>
contain a large percentage of inorganic additives and corrosion inhibiting<br>
pigments. Such additives in some cases include chromate based compounds<br>
which are considered to be toxic and harmful. These primers are normally<br>
used to provide an anchor for the top coat. Priming of metal substrate is<br>
expensive and time consuming, as this adds another operation to the coating<br>
scheme besides increasing the cost of removal of the paint during stripping<br>
operation. It also adds to the overall thickness of the coating, which may be<br>
undesirable in certain applications.<br>
Self-priming products offer very high corrosion resistance if they have<br>
good barrier characteristics. A high dielectric strength/volume resistivity is<br>
vital for withstanding electrochemical corrosion on a variety of substrates<br>
more so on ferrous surfaces. Adhesion to the substrate following the<br>
extremely rapid curing process adopted by continuous coil coating lines is<br>
essential.<br>
Self-priming coatings so far proposed for metallic structures as<br>
disclosed in the US Patents referred to above have long cure cycles. No<br>
satisfactory self-priming coating system is available at present for<br>
ferrous/non-ferrous substrate that is amenable to continuous coil coating<br>
applications and possesses the combination of high surface hardness and<br>
good flexibility with corrosion resistance and weatherability.<br>
Accordingly, there was a long felt need to provide a coating<br>
composition, which ensures hardness with flexibility in a thin self-priming<br>
coat. The inventor of the instant invention has found that the combination of<br>
a vinyl terpolymer with an alkyd resin which cross links through hydroxyl<br>
groups exhibits a synergistic effect to produce the much desired coating<br>
having good flexibility with high surface hardness while ensuring quick<br>
curing for continuous coil coating application at the same time. It will be<br>
obvious to someone skilled in the art that such properties offer important<br>
advantages in a variety of applications.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first object of the invention is to provide a quick drying, tightly<br>
adhering, self-priming polymer coating with notable dielectric, barrier and<br>
thermal characteristics.<br>
The second object of the invention is to provide a self-priming<br>
polymer coating composition with quick curing time to make it suitable for<br>
continuous coil coating lines.<br>
The third object of the invention is to provide a polymer coating<br>
which has high degree of flexibility and surface hardness at the same time.<br>
The fourth object of the invention is to provide an environment<br>
friendly chromate free corrosion resistant coating composition.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a coating method for<br>
coating a ferrous or non-ferrous metallic substrate by using a primer free<br>
corrosion resistant coating composition.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to apply the coating composition<br>
of the invention as an under coat followed by one or more top coat(s) of<br>
resins.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide coated articles at least<br>
one surface of which is coated by applying the coating composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>

on the surface of the said substrate in desired thickness and curing the same.<br>
The invention further provides a coated article comprising a ferrous or<br>
a non-ferrous metallic substrate of which at least one surface is coated with"<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A linear vinyl terpolymer, namely polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl alcohol<br>
and polyvinyl acetate with three functional groups randomly distributed<br>
along the vinyl backbone offers cross linking sites through the hydroxyl<br>
groups. The density of cross links may be controlled by the numbers and<br>
placement of hydroxyl group, in the vinyl backbone of the polymer. This<br>
polymer possess a rare combination of mechanical, thermal, chemical and<br>
dielectric properties. The functional groups along with its vinyl backbone<br>
confer to this polymer the properties of adhesion, toughness, chemical<br>
inertness and heat stability while the long linear chains contributes to the<br>
outstanding flexibility. The spatial structure of this thermoplastic material<br>
helps to form a closely packed molecular structure which in turn provides<br>
excellent barrier characteristics when coated on a wide array of substrates.<br>
The hydroxyl groups are fully accessible for cross linking and this makes the<br>
thermoplastic polymer heat curable in the presence of a mineral acid. The<br>
chain length distribution of a poly disperse polymer is made such as to<br>
permit film formation, migration by diffusion to the substrate and<br>
development of the required cohesive strength in the coating. Specifically,<br>
the terpolymer used in the invention has weight average molecular weight<br>
ranging between 20,000 and 120,000, preferably between 25,000 and<br>
70,000.<br>
The content of polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl<br>
formal of the vinyl terpolymer used for the invention is 6.0-15%, 9.0-15%<br>
and 70-84% respectively by weight and preferably 6.0 - 7.5%, 10-13% and<br>
80 - 83% respectively by weight.<br>
The said terpolymer useable in the composition may be produced by<br>
simultaneous hydrolysis and formalization of polyvinyl acetate in acetic<br>
acid media. For this purpose polyvinyl acetate of the required molecular<br>
weight (28,000-170,000) and of low to very low branching frequency is<br>
dissolved in acetic acid and formalin (37% formaldehyde aqueous solution)<br>
at room temperature. Dilute sulfuric acid (N/10 normalty) is added to this<br>
solution with agitation. The contents are well stirred, heated to 75°C and<br>
maintained at this condition for 20-24 hours. The whole process is<br>
conducted in a homogenous solution state. By regulating quantities of acetic<br>
acid, water and formaldehyde, the required composition of the functional<br>
groups of the vinyl backbone viz. acetyl, hydroxyl and formal may be<br>
obtained. Typically for one part of polyvinyl acetate, 1.65 parts of acetic<br>
acid, 0.55 parts of water and 0.45 part of formalin (37% formaldehyde<br>
solution in water) is used to obtain a composition comprising 6.0 - 6.5%<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, 11.0-12.0% polyvinyl acetate and 81.5 - 83.0% polyvinyl<br>
formal. The extent of reaction is determined by the percentage of hydroxyl<br>
and acetyl groups in the extracted polymer and the reaction is terminated at<br>
the desired point by neutralizing the acid catalyst with a dilute alkali. The<br>
polymer is next precipitated from solution by adding water as non-solvent,<br>
washed and dried. The simultaneous hydroxyl and formalisation reactions<br>
prevent the development of blocky sequences on vinyl chain in a<br>
homogenous media and thus helps to get a random terpolymer. The Tg of<br>
the terpolymer so produced ranges between 100 -115°C.<br>
The alkyd resin used in the combination acts as a tackifier and<br>
promotes adhesion at low temperature of application. On curing at elevated<br>
temperature the alkyd resin cross links with the vinyl polymer through<br>
hydroxyl groups which helps to improve the chemical inertness, thermal and<br>
corrosion resistance as well as gloss of the coating. The alkyd resin used for<br>
the invention is a medium oil resin of hydroxyl number ranging from 80-<br>
200 and preferably in the range of 120-140. The lightly cross linked vinyl<br>
alkyd matrix has excellent flexibility, scratch resistance and barrier<br>
characteristics.<br>
The alkyd resin may be derived from carboxylic polybasic acids<br>
including aliphatic saturated dibasic acids like adipic, succinic, sebacic and<br>
anthdrides thereof; aliphatic unsaturated dibasic acids like maleic, fumaric<br>
and anhydrides thereof; and aromatic polybasicacids such as phthalic,<br>
isophthalic, terephthalic and anhydrides thereof. These acids may be used<br>
alone or in combination. The polyhydric alcohol used to prepare alkyd<br>
resins may be selected from the group comprising of ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol,<br>
cyclohexene dimethanol, glycerol and pentaerythritol. These alcohols may<br>
be used alone or in combination.<br>
Modified fatty acids derived from drying to nondrying oils such as<br>
linseed oil, dehydrated castor oil, tung oil and coconut oil may be used either<br>
alone or in combination in the preparation of alkyd resins. Xylene is<br>
normally used as the azeotropic solvent for water removal during processing<br>
and also to solubilize the alkyd solids. The alkyd drier useful for the<br>
invention may be selected from various metal octoates and/or naphthenates.<br>
The alkyd resin used in this invention was produced from linseed oil,<br>
glycerin, pentaerythritol, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid with<br>
manganese nuxtra, cobalt naphthanate and zinc octoate as driers in xylene<br>
solvent. The solids percentage of this alkyd resin ranged from 60 - 75%. Its<br>
hydroxyl number ranged from 120 -140.<br>
The liquid coating may be formulated using 0.8 - 1.5 parts of the<br>
vinyl polymer with 1 part of alkyd resin (100% solids basis) and 1 - 10% by<br>
weight of phosphoric acid based on the weight of the polymer. The polymer<br>
and resin may be dissolved in a blend of organic solvents including<br>
aromatics such as toluene, xylene and naphtha and alcohols such as ethanol,<br>
butanol and isopropanol with a major proportion of ethylene dichloride.<br>
Solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone<br>
(MEBK), cellosolve, cellosolve acetate and diacetone alcohol may also be<br>
used to form solvent blends. A ternary blend of solvents is recommended<br>
for quick drying. The level of solids is maintained from 20 - 40% by weight<br>
to suit the viscosity requirements during roller coating operations on coil<br>
coating lines. Solvent-free dry formulations are also possible in a hot melt<br>
dispenser especially for thick coatings. Such solvent-free formulations can<br>
be prepared by using plasticizer such as phthalates and flow improvers such<br>
as rosin and its derivatives. The clear coat so formed shows good spreading<br>
characteristics and adhesion on all the substrates referred to earlier. High<br>
cohesive strength is obtained in short curing cycles at elevated temperatures<br>
typically used in continuous metal pre-coat lines. It has strong barrier<br>
characteristics and it passivates the metal substrates coated to restrict<br>
corrosion. The coated panels of galvanized steel, cold rolled steel and<br>
aluminum exhibit good corrosion resistance when exposed to salt spray<br>
environment and adequate resistance to blistering or loss of adhesion. Most<br>
importantly the coating exhibits extreme flexibility in thin hard layers and<br>
demonstrates a scratch hardness of at least 5H. Further, this coating shows<br>
no deterioration of adhesion and its integrity when exposed to temperatures<br>
ranging from -50°C to 180°C for sustained periods.<br>
This heat curable clear coat system may be pigmented to impart<br>
colour in low to medium gloss to coated substrates. Titanium dioxide may<br>
be added for opacity and coloured inorganic pigments and/or organic dyes<br>
may be used for colour. The pigment binding power of the polymer-resin<br>
system is quite high however, low to moderate levels of such addition is<br>
suggested for optimum corrosion resistance. This ensures that the<br>
passivating nature of the cured film and its barrier characteristics are<br>
maintained with high flexibility. Blister resistance is obtained even with a<br>
low porosity of the film due to the passivation achieved on the metal<br>
interface. A range of corrosion inhibiting pigments may be selected<br>
comprising of inorganic and organic pigments which offer passive<br>
inhibition, for example, zinc molybdate and other molybdates, zinc<br>
phosphate, mica, tolyltriazole, complex organotitanate and other organic<br>
inhibitors which operate by passive inhibition. The incorporation of<br>
corrosion inhibiting pigments improves further the corrosion resistance of<br>
the coating. The pigments can be incorporated in the coating by first<br>
forming a mill base by conventional sand grinding or ball milling<br>
techniques, a concentrated solution of the polymer and resin of concentration<br>
30 - 60% in the organic solvent blend, together with the pigments, and then<br>
blended with the remaining portion of solvents by high speed stirring or<br>
agitation. This coating, with or without pigments, dries by solvent<br>
evaporation on substrate such as cold rolled steel, hot dip galvanized steel<br>
and aluminum when sprayed or flow coated on these surfaces. The rate of<br>
evaporation of the solvents especially at the cure temperatures used in metal<br>
pre-coat lines with peak metal temperatures ranging from 180 - 280°C may<br>
be adjusted by the choice of the solvents from the ones enumerated earlier.<br>
Specifically, a blend of xylene and butanol in a 70:30 weight ratio and<br>
ethylene dichloride was used for this inventioa The ethylene dichloride<br>
content is generally kept higher in these blends and typically ranges from<br>
1.0-2.5 parts per part of the aromatic-alcohol blend by weight.<br>
The coating composition of the instant invention may be applied to<br>
ferrous and non-ferrous substrate including cold-rolled steel, hot dip<br>
galvanized steel, stainless steel, tin plated steel, aluminum and other non-<br>
ferrous substrate in thin films of dry film thickness (DFT) ranging from 5-30<br>
micrometers preferably 10-25 micrometers. This self-priming composition<br>
is particularly suited to metal pre-coating process in coil coating lines<br>
because of its quick curing nature in the temperature-time profile used in<br>
these applications. It can be formulated as free flowing one pack liquid<br>
which can be stored below 25°C for 6 (six) months or as a two pack system<br>
with the catalyst as a separate component to be mixed prior to application.<br>
The coating composition of the instant invention provides good<br>
corrosion protection to ferrous or non-ferrous substrates even without any<br>
pre-treatment of the metal surface in many cases except degreasing, thereby<br>
eliminating an expensive, environmentally damaging pre-treatment<br>
procedure.<br>
Apart from its application as a top coat, the coating composition of the<br>
instant invention may also be used as an undercoat which may be followed<br>
by top coats of resins selected from the group consisting of epoxy, urethane,<br>
alkyd, amino and polyesters.<br>
The following examples of compositions are illustrative of the<br>
invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined<br>
by the appended claims.<br>
The polyvinyl terpolymer as used in these examples are prepared by<br>
the process as described earlier with the weight content of polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl formal at 6.0 - 7.5%, 10-13% and 80-83%<br>
respectively.<br>
Example 1 - Clear coat<br>
A clear coat composition may be prepared from the following<br>
ingredients in the assigned weight percentages :<br>

Ortho Phosphoric Acid (88-93%)	0.1-2.2<br>
Xylene	7-25<br>
Butanol	3-15<br>
Ethylene Dichloride	25-55<br>
Manganese Nuxtra	0-0.2<br>
Zinc Octoate	0-0.2<br>
Cobalt Naphthanate	0-0.2<br>
A specific clear coat composition was prepared by incorporating the<br>
ingredients taken in the following weight percentages for testing :<br>
Ingredients	Weight %<br>
Polyvinyl Terpolymer	14.3<br>
Alkyd Resin (100% solids basis)	11.7<br>
Ortho Phosphoric Acid (88-93%)	0.7<br>
Xylene	16.5<br>
Butanol	7.1<br>
Ethylene Dichloride	49.5<br>
Manganese Nuxtra	0.05<br>
Zinc Octoate	0.05<br>
Cobalt Naphthanate	0.1<br>
The clear coat is prepared by dissolving the vinyl polymer and the<br>
alkyd resin in a mix of xylene - butanol (70 : 30 pts by wt.) and ethylene<br>
dichloride. The drier and the catalyst are then added to this solution.<br>
The panels used were degreased prior to application. However, no other<br>
pre-treatment was done e.g. acid oxidation for aluminum. The composition<br>
was applied and cured on aluminum, CR steel and galvanized steel panel in<br>
thickness ranging from 20-25 micrometers. The coatings exhibited good<br>
weatherability, resistance to water immersion, humidity and heat when<br>
exposed to 180°C for a sustained period of 24 hours or more. The<br>
flexibility was excellent (OT) and the scratch hardness was 5H or higher.<br>
On exposure to salt spray the scribed panel showed no detonation through<br>
blistering, loss of adhesion or corrosion for 500 hours in case of CR steel<br>
panels and galvanized panels and 1000 hours for aluminum. The<br>
galvanized panel in addition showed no white rust formation after 500 hours<br>
of exposure. The solvent resistance to MEK (Methyl Ethyl Ketone) was<br>
good with the material passing 100 rubs.<br>

prepared from the listed ingredients in the following weight percentages for<br>
testing:<br>
Ingredients	Weight %<br>
Polyvinyl Terpolymer	12.3<br>
Alkyd Resin (100% solids basis)	10.1<br>
Orthophosphoric Acid (88 - 93%)	0.6<br>
Xylene	16.0<br>
Butanol	6.6<br>
Ethylene Dichloride	47.0<br>
Titanium Dioxide	7.2<br>
Manganese Nuxtra	0.05<br>
Zinc Octoate	0.05<br>
Cobalt Naphthanate	0.1<br>
The vinyl polymer and alkyd resin are dissolved in a mix of xylene<br>
and butanol (70 : 30 pts. by wt.) and ethylene dichloride to obtain a<br>
concentrated solution of about 40% by weight. This solution is then milled<br>
with the pigments, drier and catalyst for six hours and finally mixed under<br>
agitation with the balance solvents to obtain the desired viscosity and solids<br>
level.<br>
The off-white coating was applied on substrates as in earlier example.<br>
The thickness ranged from 20 -25 micrometers. These panels showed good<br>
weatherability, resistance to water immersion and humidity. Further, there<br>
was no deterioration in properties on prolonged exposure of 24 hours or<br>
more at 200°C. Flexibility obtained was excellent (OT) and scratch hardness<br>
was found to be at least 6H. The salt spray exposure and MEK resistance<br>
showed the same behaviour as reported above for Example 1. Here again no<br>
pre-treatment of the substrate was done other than degreasing. Other colours<br>
can be incorporated by adding coloured inorganic pigments/organic dyes<br>
which offer corrosion protection by passivation and titanium dioxide if<br>
necessary, in doses of 0 - 15% by weight of the total formulation in solvent<br>
bearing compositions.<br>
The non-volatile components of the coating composition of this<br>
invention including the polymer, resin and pigments can range from<br>
20 - 100% and is typically between 30 - 40% by weight of the total<br>
composition.<br>
TESTING METHOD<br>
The numbers of tests carried out on each of the substrate were 10 and the<br>
average value has been quoted in above examples. The testing method that<br>
was applied for different physiochemical characteristics are given below :-<br>
(i) Scratch hardness - A pencil hardness index was used as is<br>
common in the industry.<br>
(ii) Corrosion resistance - Salt spray exposure as per ASTM B-117<br>
and MEK resistance using solvent rub test as is common in the<br>
industry.<br>
(iii) Adhesion - ASTM D02197/3359. The performance is indicated<br>
merely as a pass or fail.<br>
(iv) Dielectric property - Volume resistivity as per ASTM D-2.57.<br>
Value obtained = 7 x 1015OCm.<br>
(v) Flexibility - As per ASTM D-552. Instead of choosing a mandrel<br>
the coated substrate was folded on itself along a crease. All panels<br>
passed this O T bend test which is the most rigorous examination<br>
of flexibility, without any cracking or peel-off along the crease.<br>
