				<td>METHOD FOR COATING ARTICLES BY MOLD TRANSFER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to coated articles including, without limitation,<br>
contact lenses. In particular, the invention relates to coated hydrogel and<br>
silicone-hydrogel articles formed by curing a reaction mixture of article-<br>
forming material in a mold the molding surface of which has a film of the<br>
coating.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of hydrogels to form articles such as contact lenses is well<br>
known. It is further known to increase the oxygen permeability of hydrogels<br>
by adding silicone-containing monomers to the hydrogel formulations to<br>
produce silicone hydrogels.<br>
Typically, it is desirable to increase the surface wettability of<br>
hydrogel and silicone hydrogel articles by coating the articles with a<br>
hydropbilic coating. Numerous hydrophilic coatings and methods for their<br>
application are known. For example, it is known to apply a coating to a<br>
silicone hydrogel lens using gas plasma. This coating method is<br>
disadvantageous in that it requires dehydration of the lens prior to application<br>
of the plasma treatment, which treatment must be carried out under vacuum<br>
conditions.<br>
Alternatively, it is known to use solution- or solvent-based coatings<br>
to coat lenses. However, these coating methods, as does the plasma<br>
treatment, add steps to the lens manufacturing process and also result in the<br>
production of large quantities of waste. Further, application of a solution-<br>
based coating uniformly over a lens surface requires extremely precise-<br>
process control.<br>
Application of a coating onto a mold into which a lens material is<br>
dispensed also has been disclosed. However, this method has been<br>
successfully demonstrated only with non-silicone hydrogel materials.<br>
Therefore a need exists for a coating method for coating hydrogel and<br>
silicone hydrogel lenses that overcomes one or more of these disadvantages.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
A method for coating hydrogel and silicone hydrogel articles, and<br>
articles made by the method, are provided in which an uncured coating is<br>
first applied to the molding surface of a mold in which an article-forming<br>
material will be cured to form the article. Thus, the article is coated during<br>
the course of curing the material from which it is formed eliminating the<br>
need for additional processing steps after curing is completed. Additionally,<br>
the method permits the thickness and uniformity of the coating to be more<br>
easily controlled than in known coating methods. Finally, because the<br>
method does not rely on specific reaction chemistries for attachment of the<br>
coating to the lens, as do other known coating methods, any of a wide variety<br>
of coatings that cannot be adequately achieved using known coating methods<br>
are made possible.<br>
The invention provides a method for coating articles the method<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of: a.) coating a molding<br>
surface of a mold or a mold half with a coating effective amount of a high<br>
molecular weight coating composition; b.) dispensing a mixture comprising a<br>
hydrogel monomer, a silicone-containing hydrogel monomer, or a<br>
combination thereof into the mold or mold half; and c.) curing under<br>
conditions suitable to form an article coated with the coating composition.<br>
The invention may be used to produce any of a wide variety of coated<br>
articles. Preferably, the invention is used to produce ophthalmic lenses<br>
including, without limitation, contact, intraocular, and onlay lenses. More<br>
preferably, the invention is used to produce contact lenses.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by "melding surface" is meant a<br>
surface used to form a surface of an article. Typically, molded articles are<br>
formed within a mold or between two mold halves. The mold or mold halves<br>
used to form an article have an inner surface, the molding surface, and an<br>
outer non-molding surface. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that the molding surface will be of the dimensions and surface type requisite<br>
for forming the desired molded article.<br>
By "high molecular weight" is meant an average molecular weight<br>
("Mw") sufficiently high so as to avoid dissolution of the coating into the<br>
monomer mixture used. For purposes of the invention, preferably the<br>
molecular weight is determined using gel permeation chromatography<br>
("GPC") wits a light scattering detector and a high sensitivity refractive<br>
index detector, for example model PL-RI available from Polymer Labs. The<br>
GPC is performed using a phenogel 5 µm linear column equipped with a<br>
guard column of the same components and a solution of 0.5 weight percent<br>
lithium bromide in dimethyl formamide as the eluent. Flow rates are 0.5 mL<br>
per minute with injection volumes from about 10 to about 20 µL. The<br>
precise Mw used will depend upon the coating selected and the monomer<br>
mixture used. In a preferred embodiment, the Mw of the coating is greater<br>
than about 300 kD.<br>
As an alternative, useful coating compositions have a viscosity of a<br>
greater than about 1 cP, preferably at least about 4 cP, at 25 degrees<br>
centigrade. For purposes of the invention, preferably the viscosity is<br>
determined by dissolving the monomer or polymer component in a suitable<br>
solvent and measuring the viscosity at a shear rate of 40/s. Preferably used,<br>
when the article forming material is a silicone hydrogel is 1.00 weight<br>
percent in a 1:1 solvent mixture of ethanol:ethyl lactate or<br>
isopropanol'.isopropyl lactate.<br>
By "hydrogel monomer" is meant is a material that after curing and<br>
hydration is elastomeric and has a water content of about 20 weight percent<br>
or more. By "silicone-containing hydrogel monomer" is meant a hydrogel<br>
monomer that contains one or more silicone groups.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the term "monomer" refers to<br>
compounds having number average molecular weights less than about 700,<br>
that can be polymerized, and to medium to high molecular weight<br>
compounds or polymers, sometimes referred to as macromonomers or<br>
macromers, having number average molecular weights greater than about<br>
700, containing functional groups capable of further polymerization. The<br>
term monomer includes monomers, macromonomers, macromers, and<br>
prepolymers. Prepolymers are partially polymerized monomers or monomers<br>
that are capable of further polymerization.<br>
In preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for coating<br>
hydrogel and silicone-containing hydrogel articles the method comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of: a.) coating a molding surface of a<br>
mold or a mold half with a coating effective amount of a high molecular<br>
weight hydrophilic coating composition; b.) dispensing a mixture comprising<br>
a hydrogel monomer, a silicone-containing hydrogel monomer, or a<br>
combination thereof into the mold or mold half; and c.) curing under<br>
conditions suitable to form an article coated with the coating composition.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by "hydrophilic" is meant a material that,<br>
when polymerized, exhibits an advancing dynamic contact angle of less than<br>
about 100 degrees in physiological saline.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the invention is used to produce<br>
physiologically compatible contact lenses and, thus, provides a method for<br>
coating contact lenses the method comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of: a.) coating a molding surface of a mold or a mold half with a<br>
coating effective amount of a high molecular weight hydrophilic coating<br>
composition; b.) dispensing a mixture comprising a hydrogel monomer, a<br>
silicone-containing hydrogel monomer, or a combination thereof into the<br>
mold or mold half; and c.) curing under conditions suitable to form a contact<br>
lens coated with the coating composition, wherein the lens exhibits<br>
physiological compatibility.<br>
By "physiologically compatibility" or "physiological compatible," is<br>
meant that the lens exhibits clinical performance, in terms of on-eye<br>
wettability and resistance to surface deposits that is equal to or better than<br>
that of an etafilcon A lens. On-eye wettability is determined by measuring<br>
non-invasive, tear break-up time using a tear scope placed between a slit<br>
lamp microscope and a lens wearer's eye. The lens wearer blinks and holds<br>
the eye open while the eye is viewed through the slit lamp, typically at a<br>
magnification of about 16 to 20x. The time between the blink and the first<br>
observed non-wetting of the lens surface is the non-invasive, tear break-up<br>
time. The non-invasive tear break-up time for the lenses of the invention are<br>
equal to or greater than that of an etafilcon A lens or equal to or greater than<br>
about 5 to about 10 sees. Preferably, the lens of the invention exhibit a non-<br>
invasive tear break-up time of about 7 to about 10 sees.<br>
Surface deposition resistance is measured for both the front and back<br>
lens surfaces by scanning the entire lens on eye using a slit lamp with a<br>
magnification of about 16 to about 20x and a beam width and height set at<br>
approximately one-half of the corneal diameter, typically a width of<br>
approximately 2 mm and a beam height of approximately 6 mm. Deposits<br>
may be appear as discrete deposits, such as jelly bumps, or as oily patches or<br>
film and will move with the lens during blink or Josephson Push-Up testing.<br>
No observable deposition is a grade 0; grade 1 is about 1 to about 5 percent<br>
of the lens surface with deposition; grade 2 is about 6 to about 15 percent<br>
with deposition; grade 3 is about 16 to about 25 percent deposition and grade<br>
4 is greater than about 26 percent deposition. The surface deposition for the<br>
lenses of the invention are equal to or greater than that of an etafilcon A lens<br>
meaning that less than about 15 % of a clinical population will have Grade 3<br>
or higher deposition after one week of wear.<br>
Coating compositions useful in the invention may contain any of a<br>
wide variety of monomers and polymers known in the art. Preferred are<br>
polyvinyl alcohol), polyethylene oxide, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid),<br>
poly(maleic acid), poly(itaconic acid), poly(acrylamide),<br>
poly(methacrylamide), poly(dimethylacrylamide), poly(glycerol<br>
methacrylate), polystyrene sulfonic acid, polysulfonate polymers, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone), carboxymethylated polymers, such as carboxymethylcellulosc,<br>
polysaccharides, glucose amino glycans, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid,<br>
block or random copolymers of the aforementioned, and the like, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone), poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid),<br>
poly(meth)acrylamide, or poly(acrylamide) is used. More preferably, poly(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate) is used.<br>
The coating composition may, and for spin coating purposes<br>
preferably does, include a low boiling point, or less than about 90°C, solvent<br>
and a high boiling point, or greater than about 100°C, solvent. Suitable low<br>
boiling solvents include, without limitation, n-methyl pyrrolidone, acetone,<br>
chloroform, and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert-<br>
butanol, and the like. Useful high boiling solvents include, without<br>
limitation, methyl-, ethyl-, and isopropyl lactate, ethylene and (poly)ethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol, n-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide,<br>
tetrahydrogeraniol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 3-methyl-3-<br>
pentanol, dimethyl-3-octanol, 3-methoxy-1-butanol, 1,2 and 1,4-butanediol,<br>
1,3-hexanediol, water, and the like. Typically, the ratio of the low to the high<br>
boiling solvent will be about 1:1 at room temperature.<br>
Additionally, the coating composition may include, and preferably<br>
includes, at least one surfactant. Suitable surfactants include, without<br>
limitation, anionic surfactants, such as carboxylic acid salts, sulfonic acid<br>
salts, sulfuric acid salts, phosphoric and polyphosphoric acid esters, cationic<br>
surfactants, such as long chain amines and their salts, diamines and<br>
polyamines and their salts, quartemary ammonium salts, amine oxides,<br>
nonionic surfactants, such as polyoxyethylenated alkylphenols, alkyl phenol<br>
ethoxylates, polyoxyethylenated straight chain alcohols, polyethoxylated<br>
polyoxypropylene glycols, polyethoxylated polydimethylsiloxane<br>
copolymers, fluorinated alkane ethoxylate copolymers, and long chain<br>
carboxylic acid esters, zwitterionic surfactants, such as pH-sensitive and pH<br>
insensitive surfactants, and the like, and combinations thereof. The specific<br>
type and amount of surfactants used will depend upon the other components<br>
of the coating composition and the molding surface used. Typically, greater<br>
than or equal to about 0.001 weight percent and less than or equal to about 5<br>
weight percent based on the total weight of the coating composition will be<br>
used.<br>
In a first step of the method of the invention, a coating effective<br>
amount of a suitable coating composition is coated onto the molding surface<br>
of a mold or mold half. Preferably, all exterior surfaces of the article are<br>
coated and, thus, preferably the entire or substantially the entire molding<br>
surfaces of both mold halves are coated. One ordinarily skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that one of the mold half's molding surfaces may be coated with a<br>
coating different or the same as that used on the other mold half's molding<br>
surface.<br>
The thickness of the coating composition, when dry, on the molding<br>
surface of the mold must be such that an article with an acceptable surface<br>
roughness results. In embodiments in which the article is a contact lens,<br>
preferably a peak-to-peak surface roughness of the hydrated lens is less than<br>
about 500 nrn is desirable. Thus, by coating effective amount is meant an<br>
amount of the coating composition sufficient to provide a dry film thickness<br>
of the coating composition on the molding surface that will result in a<br>
hydrated article with an acceptable surface roughness and for contact lenses<br>
preferably a hydrated lens peak-to-peak surface roughness of less than about<br>
SOO nm. More preferably, for contact lens embodiments, the amount of<br>
coating composition used is an amount sufficient to produce a dry film<br>
thickness of at least about 5 nm and no more than about 70 nm, preferably at<br>
least about 5 nm and no more than about SO nm, more preferably at least<br>
about 20 nm and no more than about 40 nm.<br>
The coating composition may be applied to the molding surface by<br>
any suitable method including, without limitation, compression, swabbing,<br>
spray coating, ink jet printing, aerosolization, nebulization, dip coating, spin<br>
coating, and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, spin coating is<br>
used. Also, preferably, the coating is dried, or rendered non-tacky, prior to<br>
introduction of the article forming material into the mold. Drying may be<br>
carried out using any suitable method, but preferably is carried out at<br>
temperatures up to about the glass transition temperature ("Tg") of the mold<br>
material in air or under vacuum followed by equilibration under a blanket of<br>
nitrogen at any temperature up to about the Tg of the mold material. During<br>
the vacuum exposure process, cold traps or other filters preferably are used to<br>
prevent contamination of the mold.<br>
In a spin coating method, the coating composition preferably has a<br>
lower surface tension than that of the molding surface's surface energy.<br>
More preferably, the surface tension of the coating composition is greater<br>
than about 3 dynes/cm below that of the surface energy of the molding<br>
surface to which it is applied when measured at the coating application<br>
temperature. Most preferably, the surface tension of the coating composition<br>
is more than 8 dynes/cm below that of the surface energy of the molding<br>
surface.<br>
In a preferred spin coating method for use in forming contact lenses,<br>
spin coating is used to deposit a coating of a dry thickness of about 5 to about<br>
70 run onto a molding surface of a mold. If the surface tension of the coating<br>
differs from the surface energy of the mold by greater than about 8 dynes/cm<br>
when measured at the coating application temperature, a suitable spin profile<br>
is at least about 6,000 and no more than about 8,000 RPM using at least<br>
about 2 and no more than about 20 µl of coating composition and spinning<br>
for at least about 3 sec. If the surface tension difference is less than about 8<br>
dynes/cm, the mold is spun up to at least about 3,000 and no more than about<br>
5,000 RPM using at least about 2 and no more than about 10µl of coating<br>
composition and then the mold is span up to at least about 7,000 and more<br>
than about 10,000 RPM for at least about 3 seconds prior to stopping.<br>
Any excess coating accumulating at the mold edges must be removed<br>
and removal may be carried out by any convenient method including, without<br>
limitation, swabbing the excess, removing the excess using vacuum, solvent,<br>
washing or pressurized air jet. Preferably, the excess is removed using an air<br>
jet. In using the air-jet, it is critical that spinning is started prior to the jet<br>
being turned on and, preferably, the air jet pressure is equal to or greater than<br>
about 10psi.<br>
In the second step of the method of the invention, an article-forming<br>
material that is a mixture comprising a hydrogel monomer, a silicone-<br>
containing hydrogel monomer, or combinations thereof is dispensed into the<br>
mold or mold half. Useful hydrogel monomers are known and include,<br>
without limitation, hydrophilic monomers, preferably acrylic- or vinyl-<br>
containing. Hydrogel monomers that may be used include, without<br>
limitation, polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal<br>
hydroxy groups replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable<br>
double bond. Suitable monomers include, without limitation, polyethylene<br>
glycol, ethoxylated alkyl glucoside and ethoxylated bisphenol A reacted with<br>
one or more equivalents of an end-capping group such as isocyanatoethyl<br>
methacrylate, methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride, vinylbenzoyl<br>
chloride, or the like, to produce a polyethylene polyol having one or more<br>
terminal polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene polyol<br>
through linking moieties such as carbamate or ester groups. Additional<br>
examples of hydrogel monomers include, without limitation, hydrophilic<br>
vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate monomers as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,070,215 and the hydrophilic oxazolone monomers as disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,910,277, both references incorporated herein in their entireties<br>
by reference.<br>
The term "vinyl-type" or "vinyl-containing" monomers refer to<br>
monomers containing the vinyl grouping (-CH=CH2) and are generally<br>
highly reactive. Such hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers are known to<br>
polymerize relatively easily. "Acrylic-type" or "acrylic-containing"<br>
monomers are those monomers containing the acrylic group: (CH2=CRCOX)<br>
wherein R is H or CH3, and X is O or N and which are known to polymerize<br>
readily such as, without limitation, N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and<br>
acrylic acid.<br>
The preferred hydrogel monomers used to make the silicone-<br>
containing hydrogel useful in the invention may be either acrylic- or vinylic-<br>
containing and the monomers themselves may be crosslinkers. Useful<br>
vinylic-containing monomers include, without limitation, N-vinyl lactams,<br>
such as N-vinyl pyrrolidone ("NVP"), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide, N-vinyl-<br>
N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide, and N-vinyl formamide with<br>
N-vinyl pyrrolidone being preferred.<br>
Particularly useful silicone-containing hydrogel monomers include<br>
those that contains at least two [-Si-O-] repeating units. Preferably, the total<br>
Si and attached O are present in the silicone-containing monomer in an<br>
amount greater than about 20 weight percent, and more preferably greater<br>
than about 30 weight percent of the total molecular weight of the silicone-<br>
containing monomer.<br>
Preferred silicone-containing hydrogel monomers are of the following<br>
of Structure I:<br>
wherein R51 is H or CH3, q is 1,2, or 3 and for each q, R52, R53 and R54 are<br>
independently an alkyl or an aromatic, preferably ethyl, methyl, benzyl,<br>
phenyl, or a siloxane chain comprising from 1 to 100 repeating Si-O units, p<br>
is 1 to 10, r = (3-q), X is O or NR55, where R55 is H or a alkyl group with 1 to<br>
4 carbons, a is 0 or 1, and L is a divalent linking group which preferably<br>
comprises from 2 to 5 carbons, which may also optionally comprise ether or<br>
hydroxyl groups, for example, a polyethylene glycol chain. Examples of<br>
such monomers include, without limitation,<br>

methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane,<br>
methacryloxypropyipentamethyidisiloxane, and (3-methacryloxy-2-<br>
hydroxypropyloxy)propylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane.<br>
It is more preferred to use linear mono-alkyl terminated<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes ("mPDMS") such as those shown in the following<br>
Structure II:<br>
where b is a distribution having a most frequently occurring b value and that<br>
b value is 0 to 100, preferably 8 to 10; Rsg is a group containing a free radical<br>
polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated moiety, preferably methacrylate,<br>
methacrylamide, styryl, N-vinyl amide, N-vinyl lactams, vinyl carbonates,<br>

carboxylic acid or ether groups, preferably unsubstituted alkyl or aryl groups,<br>
more preferably methyl; and R60 is an alkyl, or aryl group, which may be<br>
further substituted with alcohol, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether<br>

C3-8 alkyl groups, most preferably butyl.<br>
Additional silicone-containing hydrogel monomers may be combined<br>
with the silicone-containing hydrogel monomers of Stuctures I and II to form<br>
the articles produced by the method of the invention. Any known silicone-<br>
containing hydrogel monomer useful for making silicone-containing<br>
hydrogels can be used in combination with the silicone-containing hydrogel<br>
monomer of Structure I and II to form the articles of this invention. Many<br>
silicone-containing hydrogel monomers useful for this purpose are disclosed<br>

In alternative embodiments, the silicone-containing hydrogel<br>
mixtures useful in this invention, composed of the silicone-containing<br>
hydrogel monomers of either or both Structure I and Structure II also may<br>
contain hydrophilic monomers. The hydrophilic monomers optionally used<br>
can be any of the known hydrophilic monomers useful in making hydrogels.<br>
The preferred hydrophilic monomers used to make the silicone-<br>
containing hydrogel monomers of this invention may be either acrylic- or<br>
vinyl-containing. Such monomers may themselves be used as crosslinking<br>
agents. Hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers that may be incorporated<br>
into the silicone-containing hydrogels of the present invention include<br>
monomers such as N-vinyl lactams (e.g. NVP), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide,<br>
N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl fonnamide, N-vinyl formamide,<br>
with NVP being preferred.<br>
Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention<br>
include polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl<br>
groups replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable double<br>
bond. Examples include polyethylene glycol, ethoxylated alkyl glucoside,<br>
and ethoxylated bisphenol A reacted with one or more molar equivalents of<br>
an end-capping group such as isocyanatoethyl methacrylate ("EM"),<br>
methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride, vinylbenzoyl chloride, or the<br>
like, to produce a polyethylene polyol having one or more terminal<br>
polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene polyol through<br>
linking moieties such as carbamate or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl<br>
carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 5,070,215, and the<br>
hydrophilic oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,910,277,<br>
both references incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. Other<br>
suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
More preferred hydrophilic monomers which may be incorporated<br>
into the polymer of the present invention include hydrophilic monomers such<br>
as N,N-dimethylacrylamide ("DMA"), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
("HEMA"), glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, NVP,<br>
polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid with<br>
DMA being the most preferred.<br>
Other monomers that can be present in the reaction mixture used to<br>
form the hydrogel or silicone-containing hydrogel monomer mixtures useful<br>
in this invention include ultra-violet absorbing monomers, reactive tints,<br>
pigments, and the like. Additional processing aids such as release agents or<br>
wetting agents can also be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
A polymerization initiator preferably is included with the hydrogel or<br>
silicone-containing hydrogel monomer mixture. An initiator also may be<br>
used in the coating composition, but is not preferred. The coating<br>
composition and monomer mixture initiators may be the same or different.<br>
The polymerization initiators used may be visible light, thermal, an<br>
ultraviolet initiators, or the like, or a combination thereof. These initiators<br>
are well known in the art and commercially available. The initiator may be<br>
used in catalytically effective amounts which is an amount sufficient to<br>
initiate the polymerization reaction desired Generally, about 0.1 to about 2<br>
parts by weight per 100 parts of the hydrogel or silicone hydrogel will be<br>
used.<br>
The monomer mixture is dispensed into the coated mold. The<br>
hydrogel or silicone-containing hydrogel monomer mixture may be dispensed<br>
into the mold or mold half by any convenient means including, without<br>
limitation, pipetting, dispensing via syringe, pumping via automated or<br>
manual pump, and the like and combinations thereof. In the next step of the<br>
invention, the hydrogel or silicone-containing hydrogel monomer mixture is<br>
cured, or polymerized to form a coated article. Dwell time, or the elapsed<br>
time from which the monomer mixture is dispensed into the mold until<br>
curing commences is critical because the coating composition is soluble in<br>
the hydrogel and silicone-containing hydrogel monomer mixtures. Dwell<br>
time must be less than about S minutes and preferably is less than about 45<br>
sees.<br>
The curing additionally is carried out under conditions suitable for<br>
curing the coated article to be formed. Suitable conditions will depend on a<br>
number of factors including, without limitation, the amount and type of the<br>
coating composition and monomer mixture used, the article to be formed,<br>
and the nature, i.e., visible light or heat, of the cure used. The determination<br>
of the precise conditions required are within the ability of one ordinarily<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Curing of the monomer mixture may be initiated using the<br>
appropriate choice of heat, visible or ultraviolet light, or other means and<br>
preferably is carried out in the presence of a polymerization initiator. For<br>
contact lens production, the preferred initiator is a 1:1 blend of 1-<br>
hydroxycyelohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2, 4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide and the preferred method of polymerization<br>
initiation is visible light For some monomer reaction mixtures it is preferred<br>
to cure the reaction mixtures at temperatures slightly above room<br>
temperature, such as 25-90°C, so as to prevent phase separation of the<br>
components. In a particularly preferred embodiment for contact lens<br>
production, the reaction mixture is precured at about 45 °C followed by<br>
through-curing at about 70°C.<br>
The resulting article will be coated with the coating composition<br>
coated onto the molding surface of the mold. After curing of the monomer<br>
mixture and coating composition, the resulting article may be treated with a<br>
solvent to remove any diluent used or any traces of unreacted components,<br>
and hydrate the polymer to form the hydrogel. For contact lenses, the solvent<br>
used may be water or an aqueous solution such as physiological saline.<br>
Alternatively, and depending on the solubility characteristics of the<br>
diluent used to make the lens and the solubility characteristics of any residual<br>
unpolymerized monomers, the solvent initially used may be an organic liquid<br>
such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, mixtures thereof, or the like, or a<br>
mixture of one or more such organic liquids with water, followed by<br>
extraction with pure water (or physiological saline) to produce a hydrogel or<br>
silicone hydrogel lens swollen with water.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a silicone-containing hydrogel lens is<br>
made by dispensing into the mold or mold half, and subsequently curing, a<br>
macromer with a reaction mixture that include silicone-containing monomers<br>
and hydrophilic monomers. This technique affords a high level of control of<br>
the structure of the ultimate product.<br>
The macromers may be, and preferably are, made by combining a/an<br>
(meth)acrylate and a silicone in the presence of a Group Transfer<br>
Polymerization ("GTP") catalyst. These macromers typically comprise<br>
copolymers of various monomers. They may be formed in such a way that<br>
the monomers come together in distinct blocks, or in a generally random<br>
distribution. These macromers may furthermore be linear, branched, or star<br>
shaped. Branched structures are formed for instance if polymethacrylates, or<br>
crosslinkable monomers such as 3-(trimethylsiloxy)propyl methacrylate are<br>
included in the macromer. Initiators, reaction conditions, monomers, and<br>
catalysts that can be used to make GTP polymers are known, as for example<br>
described in "Group-Transfer Polymerization" by O.W. Webster, in<br>
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons)<br>
p. S80, 1987. These polymerizations are conducted under anhydrous<br>
conditions. Hydroxyl-functional monomers, like HEMA, can be<br>
incorporated as their trimethylsiloxy esters, with hydrolysis to form free<br>
hydroxyl group after polymerization. GTP offers the ability to assemble<br>
macromers with control over molecular weight distribution and monomer<br>
distribution on the chains. This macromer is then reacted with a reaction<br>
mixture comprising predominantly polydimethylsiloxane (preferably,<br>
rnPDMS), and hydrophilic monomers.<br>
Preferred macromer components include mPDMS, 3-<br>
methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane ('TRIS"), methyl<br>
methacrylate, HEMA, DMA, methacrylonitrile, ethyl methacrylate, butyl<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl-1-methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylamide and methacrylic acid. It is even more preferred that the<br>
macromer is made from a reaction mixture comprising HEMA, methyl<br>
methacrylate, TRIS, and mPDMS. It is most preferred that macromer is<br>
made from a reaction mixture comprising, consisting essentially of, or<br>
consisting of about 19.1 moles of the trimethylsilyl ether of HEMA, about<br>
2.8 moles of methyl methacrylate, about 7.9 moles of TRIS, and about 3.3<br>
moles of mono-methacryloxypropyl terminated mono-butyl terminated<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, and is completed by reacting the aforementioned<br>
material with about 2.0 moles per mole of 3-isopropenyl-?,?-dimethylbenzyl<br>
isocyanate using dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst.<br>
Silicone-containing hydrogels can be made by reacting blends of<br>
macromers, monomers, and other additives such as UV blockers, tints,<br>
internal wetting agents, and polymerization initiators. The reactive<br>
components of these blends typically comprise a combination of hydrophobic<br>
silicone with hydrophilic components. Because these components are often<br>
immiscible because of their differences in polarity, it is particularly<br>
advantageous to incorporate a combination of hydrophobic silicone<br>
monomers with hydrophilic monomers, especially those with hydroxyl<br>
groups, into the macromer. The macromer can then serve to compatibilize<br>
the additional silicone and hydrophilic monomers that are incorporated in the<br>
final reaction mixture. These blends typically also contain diluents to further<br>
compatibilize and solubilize all components. Preferably, the silicone based<br>
hydrogels are made by reacting the following monomer mix: macromer; an<br>
Si8-10 monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane; and hydrophilic<br>
monomers together with minor amounts of additives and photoinitiators. It is<br>
more preferred that the hydrogels are made by reacting macromer; an Si8-10<br>
monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane; TRIS; DMA; HEMA;<br>
and tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ("TEGDMA"). It is most preferred<br>
that the hydrogels are made from the reaction of (all amounts are calculated<br>
as weight percent of the total weight of the combination) macromer (about<br>
18%); an Si8-10 monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane (about<br>
28%); TRIS (about 14%); DMA (about 26%); HEMA (about 5%);<br>
TEGDMA (about 1%), polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") (about 5%); with the<br>
balance comprising minor amounts of additives and photoinitiators, and that<br>
the reaction is conducted in the presence of 20%wt dimethyl-3-octanol<br>
diluent.<br>
The preferred range of the combined silicone-containing monomer of<br>
Structure I and additional silicone-containing monomers, if present in the<br>
reaction mixture, is at least about 5 to about 100 weight percent, more<br>
preferably at least about 10 and no more than about 90 weight percent, and<br>
most preferably at least about 15 and no more than about 80 weight percent<br>
of the reactive components in the reaction mixture. The preferred range of<br>
optional hydrophilic monomer if present in the above invention is at least<br>
about S and no more than about 80 weight percent, more preferably at least<br>
about 10 and no more than about 60 weight percent, and most preferably at<br>
least about 20 and no more than about 50 weight percent of the reactive<br>
components in the reaction mixture. The preferred range of diluent is from<br>
about 0 to no more than about 70 weight percent, more preferably about 0 to<br>
no more than about 50 weight percent, and most preferably about 0 to no<br>
more than about 20 weight percent of the total reaction mixture. The amount<br>
of diluent required varies depending on the nature and relative amounts of<br>
the reactive components.<br>
In a preferred combination of reactive components at least about 10<br>
and no more than about 60, more preferably at least about 15 and no more<br>
than about 50 weight percent of the reactive components is silicone-<br>
containing monomer, at least about 20 and no more than about 50 weight<br>
percent of the reactive components is silicone-containing monomer of<br>
Structure I, at least about 10 and no more than 50 percent of the reactive<br>
components is a hydrophilic monomer, more preferably DMA, at least about<br>
about 0.1 and no more than about 1.0 percent of the reactive components is a<br>
UV or preferably a visible light-active photoinitiator and about 0 to no more<br>
than about 20 weight percent of the total reaction mixture is a secondary or<br>
tertiary alcohol diluent, more preferably a tertiary alcohol.<br>
Mold materials useful in the invention are those that are unreactive to<br>
the coating composition and monomer mixture used. Preferably mold<br>
materials are polyolefins, such as polypropylene, and cyclic polyoelfins, such<br>
as those available under the tradename TOPAS®.<br>

following, non-limiting examples.<br>

Example 1<br>
A predominantly poly-DMA ("pDMA") pre-polymer of<br>
DMArHEMA of n = 70 : n = 4 was made using Group Transfer<br>
Polymerization and functionalized with n = 3 mole equivalents of TMI as<br>
follows. 40 g THF, tetrabutylammonium 3-chlorobenzoate (TBACB, lM<br>
solution n THF, 0.31 mL, 0.00031 moles), 0.09 g bis(dimethylamino)-<br>
methylsilane, 0.7 g p-xylene and 20.23 g (0.1 moles) 2-trimethylsiloxyethyl<br>
methacrylate were charged to a dry, three-necked flask under nitrogen. 4.36<br>
g (0.025 moles) Memyhnmethylsilyl dimethylketene acetal were added to the<br>
mixture while stirring. The reaction was allowed to reach an exothermal<br>
peak and then to cool to 24°C. The solution was diluted with 82g THF and<br>
173.5 g (1.75 moles) DMA was fed through a 100 mL syringe over a two<br>
hour period. The exothermal increase was controlled to below 55 °C by<br>
reducing the feed rate of DMA and cooling the flask with ice. Additional<br>
TBACB (lM solution in THF, 0.94 mL, 0.00094 moles) diluted with 9 mL<br>
of THF was fed slowly during the reaction. 160 g dry THF were added to the<br>
solution after the temperature was dropped back to 36 °C. The reaction was<br>
quenched with a mixture of 3.6 g deionized water, 6.40 g methanol, and 0.06<br>
g dichloroacetic acid at 24 °C after 4 ½ hours of total reaction time. The<br>
quenched solution was allowed to reflux at 65 °C for 5 hours and then<br>
solvents were distilled off while toluene was added until the vapor<br>
temperature reached 110.3 °C. To the toluene solution was added a mixture<br>
of 15.1 g (0.08 moles) TMI and 0.98 g dibutyl tin dilauratc and the mixture<br>
refluxed at 115 °C for 3 hours. The resulting solution was allowed to cool<br>
and was then filtered through a membrane and the solvent evaporated off<br>
under vacuum at 30-45°C.<br>
Two coating formulations were made by dissolving the pre-polymer<br>
into IPA at 25 weight percent based on the total weight of the solution, along<br>
with 0.1 weight percent of DOE-120 surfactant. The coatings each were<br>
applied to the molding surfaces of complementary mold halves of lens molds<br>
made of TOP AS® 5013. Application of the coating was by compression<br>
molding of approximately 3 µl of coating solution onto the molding surface<br>
with a silicone pad. For the front curve molding surface, the pad was<br>
brought into contact with the coating, dropped onto the molding surface,<br>
compressed for approximately 0.5 sec., held for 1 sec., and released over a<br>
period of approximately 2 sec. For the back curve molding surface, the pad<br>
was dropped onto the molding surface, compressed and released over a<br>
period of approximately 0.5 sec. The coating was dried at room temperature<br>
for 30 min. Mean dry coating thicknesses were estimated to vary between 1<br>
and 2 µm based on thickness measurements on flat TOPAS surfaces using<br>
Atomic Force Microscopy ("AFM").<br>
Lenses were cast using the molds by dispensing into the molds a<br>
silicone hydrogel lens material of the following formulation:<br>
100 parts of the above listed formulation were mixed with 20 parts of 3,7-<br>
dimethyl-3-octanol diluent.<br>
Macromer Preparation<br>
To a dry container housed in a dry box under nitrogen at ambient<br>
temperature was added 30.0 g (0.277 mol) of<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, a solution of 13.75 ml of a 1M solution of<br>
TBACB (386.0 g TBACB in 1000 ml dry THF), 61.39 g (0.578 mol) of p-<br>
xylene, 154.28 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate (1.4 equivalents relative to<br>
initiator), 1892.13 (9.352 mol) 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5<br>
equivalents relative to initiator) and 4399.78 g (61.01 mol) of THF. To a<br>
dry, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermocouple and<br>
condenser, all connected to a nitrogen source, was charged the above mixture<br>
prepared in the dry box.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 15 °C while stirring and purging<br>
with nitrogen. After the solution reaches 15°C, 191.75 g (1.100 mol) of 1-<br>
trimethylsiloxy-1-methoxy-2-methylpropcnc (1 equivalent) was injected into<br>
the reaction vessel. The reaction was allowed to exotherm to approximately<br>
62 °C and then 30 ml of a 0.40 M solution of 154.4 g TBACB in 11 ml of dry<br>
THF was metered in throughout the remainder of the reaction. After the<br>
temperature of reaction reached 30 °C and the metering began, a solution of<br>
467.56 g (2.311 mol) 2-(trimcthylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (2.1 equivalents<br>
relative to the initiator), 3636.6. g (3.463 mol) n-butyl<br>
monomethacryloxypropyl-polydimethylsiloxane (3.2 equivalents relative to<br>
the initiator), 3673.84 g (8.689 mol) TRIS (7.9 equivalents relative to the<br>
initiator) and 20.0 g bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane was added.<br>
The mixture was allowed to exotherm to approximately 38-42 °C and<br>
then allowed to cool to 30 °C. At that time, a solution of 10.0 g (0.076 mol)<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 154.26 g (1.541 mol) methyl methacrylate<br>
(1.4 equivalents relative to the initiator) and 1892.13 g (9.352 mol) 2-<br>
trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate (8.5 equivalents relative to the initiator)<br>
was added and the mixture again allowed to exotherm to approximately 40<br>
°C. The reaction temperature dropped to approximately 30 °C and 2 gallons<br>
of THF were added to decrease the viscosity. A solution of 439.69 g water,<br>
740.6 g methanol and 8.8 g (0.068 mol) dichloroacetic acid was added and<br>
the mixture refluxed for 4.5 hours to de-block the protecting groups on the<br>
HEMA. Volatiles were then removed and toluene added to aid in removal of<br>
the water until a vapor temperature of 110 °C was reached.<br>
The reaction flask was maintained at approximately 110 °C and a<br>
solution of 443 g (2.201 mol) TMI and 5.7 g (0.010 mol) dibutyltin dilaurate<br>
were added. The mixture was reacted until the isocyanate peak was gone by<br>
IR. The toluene was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield an off-<br>
white, anhydrous, waxy reactive monomer. The macromer was placed into<br>
acetone at a weight basis of approximately 2:1 acetone to macromer. After<br>
24 hrs, water was added to precipitate out the macromer and the macromer<br>
was filtered and dried using a vacuum oven between 45 and 60 °C for 20-30<br>
hrs.<br>
The lens material was cured in the molds using visible light for<br>
approximately 30 min. at 45 °C after which the lenses were demolded,<br>
leached using 100 % IPA, and exchanged into fresh borate-buffered saline<br>
solution. The time between dispensing the lens material into the molds and<br>
the initiation of the cure, or the dwell time, was less than 5 minutes in all<br>
cases.<br>
Lens wettability was measured using dynamic contact angle as<br>
follows. Five samples of each lens type were prepared by cutting out a center<br>
strip approximately 5 mm in width and equilibrating the strip in borate-<br>
buffered saline solution for more than 30 min. Contact angles of the strips<br>
were determined using a Cahn DCA-315 micro-balance. Each sample was<br>
cycled x 4 in borate-buffered saline and the cycles were averaged to obtain<br>
the advancing and receding contact angles for each lens. The contact angles<br>
of the 5 lenses were then averaged to obtain the mean contact angle for the<br>
set.<br>
The advancing contact angles for the lenses from the coated molds<br>
were 65 ± 4°. The advancing contact angle for the uncoated control was 99 ±<br>
8°. This demonstrates that the mold transfer coating dramatically improved<br>
the wettability of the silicone hydrogel lenses.<br>
Examples 2-5<br>
Random copolymers of DMA and HEMA (n = 272 for DMA and n =<br>
23 for HEMA) were prepared using free-radical polymerization as follows.<br>
HEMA (300 mg, 2.31 mmole), DMA (29.7 g, 300 mmole), and 100 mg CGI<br>
1850 were dissolved in 120 mL of 3-methyl-3-pentanol. The mixture was<br>
degassed thoroughly by evacuating for 10 to 15 min., followed by purging<br>
with nitrogen. The evacuating/purging was repeated 3 to 4 times and then<br>
the mixture was placed under a nitrogen environment and transferred to a<br>
crystallizing dish and covered with a watch glass. The mixture was exposed<br>
to visible light, Phillips TL20 W/03T bulbs, for a period of approximately 1<br>
hr and then the polymerization was terminated by exposing the system to<br>
oxygen.<br>
The resulting polymer was precipitated by diluting the mixture with<br>
hexanes. Further purification was carried out by dissolving the polymer in<br>
acetone and re-precipitating with hexanes. The acetone/hexanes sequence<br>
was repeated and the white polymer was washed thoroughly with hexanes<br>
and dried on a rotary evaporator with the product being cut into several small<br>
pieces prior to completion of drying. The yield was 27.0 g (90 %) of a white,<br>
foam-like product.<br>
A portion of the above product was derivatized as its methacrylate<br>
using the following procedure. A three-necked, SO mL, round bottomed flask<br>
was heat dried under vacuum, placed under nitrogen and charged with 10 mL<br>
THF. Pyridine, 5 mL, was added to the flask, followed by 64S mg (7.5<br>
mmole) methacrylic acid. The system was cooled to below S °C and 1.026 g<br>
(9 mmole) methanesulfonyl chloride was added to the solution in a drop-wise<br>
fashion over a period of 5 to 10 min. The mixture was stirred for an<br>
additional 10 min while allowing it to warm to room temperature.<br>
A 250 mL, three-necked flask was charged with 9 g HEMA/DMA<br>
copolymer and 9 mg phenotbiazine. The system was purged with nitrogen<br>
and 50 mL of THF was added to dissolve the compounds. The mixed<br>
anhydride solution was added to the flask via a syringe and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred overnight at ambient temperature.<br>
The solution was filtered through a sintered glass funnel into 200 mL<br>
of stirred hexanes. The solvents were decanted and the product was purified<br>
by dissolving it in isopropyl acetate, followed by the addition of hexanes.<br>
The polymer was washed with 2 x 50 mL of hexanes and dried in a rotary<br>
evaporator. Further purification was required due to the high methacrylic<br>
acid content The product was dissolved in acetone, followed by<br>
precipitation using hexanes.<br>
A coating formulation of 20 wt percent pDMA/HEMA and 0.1 wt<br>
percent DOE-120 in IPA was applied to TOPAS 5013 molds as in Example<br>
1. Dry coating thickness was greater than 1 mn as measured by AFM. Both<br>
the native polymer and functionalized (with methacrylate) were examined as<br>
coatings. Lenses were made using the silicone hydrogel lens material of<br>
Example 1, except that the dwell time was as set forth on Table 2 below.<br>
Additionally on Table 2 is shown the wettability for the coatings.<br>
The results demonstrate that acceptable wettability, or an advancing contact<br>
angle less than 90°, can be obtained with or without the methacrylate group.<br>
Further, the results show that contact angle is dependent on dwell time, times<br>
of less than 2.5 min. producing the most wettable lens.<br>
Examples 6-9<br>
Poly-HEMA coatings were evaluated for efficacy and wettability.<br>
The coatings were prepared by exposing a solution of HEMA, Blue HEM A,<br>
and IRGACURE 1850 in ethylene glycol to low intensity visible light,<br>
Phillips TL20 W/03T bulbs, using curing times ranging from 1 to 2 hours.<br>
The polymers were isolated after aqueous work-ups followed by several<br>
aqueous washes to remove unreacted components. Polymer molecular<br>
weights of less than about 300 kD were found to be inadequate for use as a<br>
coating polymer with the lens material of Example 1. A poly-HEMA of 360<br>
kD MW, available from Aldrich Chemical Company, was successfully used<br>
as a coating. Coating formulations with differing concentrations of poly-<br>
HEMA were prepared as follows:<br>
Poly-HEMA:water:ethanol:DOE-120= 10:20:70:0.1 wAv<br>
Poly-HEMA:water:ethanol:DOE-120= 15:20:65:0.1 w/w<br>
Poly-HEMA:water:ethanol:DOE-l20 = 20:20:60:0.1 w/w<br>
The coatings were applied to the molding surfaces of TOPAS 5013<br>
molds according to the procedure of Example 1, except that prior to coating,<br>
the molds were treated for 
of the coating solution onto the mold. Lenses were made using procedures<br>
and the silicone hydrogel lens material of Example 1, except that dwell time<br>
was 45 sec.<br>
The resulting coated lenses were tested for wettability using dynamic<br>
contact angle and for surface roughness using AFM. AFM images were<br>
acquired with contact mode AFM using a 0.06 N/m SiN4 cantilever imaging<br>
in borate-buffered saline solution. Imaging was minimized before data was<br>
acquired and typically was 
optical zone and on the anterior surface of each lens. Two lenses were<br>
evaluated for a total of 6 images. Mean peak-to-peak roughness values were<br>
calculated using 24 10 x 10 µm areas from these images. Peak-to-peak<br>
roughness was defined as the difference in height between the lowest and the<br>
highest point in the area tested. On Table 3 is shown the results.<br>
The results demonstrate that wettability improved with increasing levels of<br>
poly-HEMA m the coating solution. Additionally, surface roughness<br>
increased with increasing poly-HEMA content with the 20 wt percent poly-<br>
HEMA lens being too rough and misshapen to analyze. The 10 wt percent<br>
poly-HEMA coating produced a dry coating thickness on the mold of<br>
approximately 200 nm. Target peak-to-peak roughness for a useful lens is 
500 nm and, thus, the dry coating thickness must be substantially less than<br>
200 nm to achieve an acceptable surface roughness while maintaining desired<br>
wettability.<br>
Examples 10-13<br>
The silicone hydrogel lens material of Example 1 produced lenses<br>
with a water content of approximately 31 percent. Another similar lens<br>
formulation, with a water content of 39 % , is as follows:<br>
The remainder of the formulation was additives and diluents. The monomer<br>
to diluent ratio was 100:20, the diluent being 3, 7-dimethyl-3-octanol. The<br>
lenses of this material were coated with the 300 kD poly-HEMA coating, but<br>
resulting wettability and surface roughness were unacceptable.<br>
A higher Mw poly-HEMA, containing greater than 1.6 wt percent of<br>
Blue HEMA was synthesized using visible light initiated by CGI 1850 and<br>
the resultant polymer had a Mw of &gt; 1,000,000. A mixture of 900 mg blue<br>
HEMA, 44.1 g HEMA, 615 mg CGI 1850 and 150 mL ethylene glycol was<br>
stirred until homogeneous and the system was degassed as described in<br>
Examples 2-5. The mixture was transferred to a large crystallizing dish and<br>
covered with a watch glass. Polymerization of the olefinic moieties was<br>
conducted under visible light for approximately 1 hour. Upon quenching of<br>
the polymerization using oxygen, the mixture was poured into 500 mL<br>
borate-buffered saline solution and stirred for several hours until the material<br>
was transformed into a more rigid form. The liquids were decanted and the<br>
product washed with another 500 mL borate-buffered saline solution. The<br>
polymer was cut into several smaller pieces and stirred in 500 mL deionized<br>
water for more than 1 hour to the point that the product becomes gel-like and<br>
was sparingly soluble in the solvent. The mixture was then diluted with a<br>
small quantity of borate-buffered saline solution to enable better precipitation<br>
of the polymer. The mixture was filtered and washed in deionized water<br>
until the material did not appear soluble. The suspension was filtered, dried<br>
in a rotary evaporator, cut into smaller pieces and further dried until it<br>
appeared crystalline and anhydrous. The dark blue polymer was then milled<br>
into fine particles and subjected to more deionized water washings<br>
accompanied by 1 to 2 hours of stirring with each wash. Washing continued<br>
until little or no blue color was visible in solution and the product was<br>
filtered, dried at reduced pressure, and ground in a blender. The Mw of this<br>
coating polymer was measured to be 1.2 million g/mol using GPC and a 2 %<br>
solution of the polymer in a 1:1 ethanolrethyl lactate solvent had a viscosity<br>
of 17.7 cP at 25°C at a shear rate of 40/s.<br>
This coating was used to coat TOPAS 5013 molds via spin coating<br>
according to the following procedure. Solutions of the polymer from 0.5 to 2<br>
wt percent by steps if 0.5 wt percent were dissolved in a mixed solvent<br>
system of 1 part ETOH and 1 part ethyl lactate. The coating was applied to<br>
the molding surface of the mold by dispensing the solution onto the center of<br>
a part spinning at approximately 6000 rpm and allowing the part to spin for 5<br>
sec. before stopping. Lenses were made with these coated molds using the<br>
above-described lens material and a dwell time of 30 sec. On Table 5 is<br>
shown the wettability and surface roughness of the resulting lenses.<br>
The results show that changing the dry film thickness can simultaneously<br>
achieve acceptable wettability and surface roughness.<br>
Example 14<br>
High Mw blue poly-HEMA coated silicone hydrogel lenses with the<br>
formulation listed on Table 6 were formed.<br>
The remainder of the formulation were additives and diluents. The monomer<br>
to diluent ratio was 100:20, the diluent being 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol. Acetic<br>
acid, 1 % of the final mix, was used to stabilize the monomer.<br>
TOPAS 5013 front and back curve molds were coated with a 1.25 wt<br>
percent solution of blue-poly-HEMA and lens made as described in<br>
Examples 10 -13. Excess coating accumulated near the edge of the front<br>
surface mold was removed using a cloth swab during the spinning process.<br>
The lenses were tested for wettability and surface roughness prior to<br>
clinical evaluation. Mean peak-to-peak front surface roughness was 291 nm<br>
and mean advancing contact angle was 83º. Five lenses of -0.50 diopter<br>
power were fit in a contra-lateral study for a 30 min. wear schedule. The lens<br>
surface was equivalent in on-eye wettability, or tear break-up time, and<br>
deposition resistance to ACUVUE® etafilcon A lenses demonstrating that<br>
application of the coating to the lens results in a physiological compatible<br>
lens.<br>
