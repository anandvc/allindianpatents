FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a filler composition, more particularly, to a free-flowing filler composition containing, or derived from, silated core polysulfide, and to a rubber containing the filler composition.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Fuel economies and the need to protect the environment are economic and societal priorities. As a result, it has become desirable to produce elastomers with good mechanical properties so that they can be used in the form of rubber compositions usable for the construction of tires with improved properties, having in particular reduced rolling resistance.<br>
To this end, numerous solutions have been proposed, such as, for example, the use of coupling, starring or functionalizing agents with reinforcing filler to modify elastomers with the goal of obtaining a good interaction between the modified elastomer and the reinforcing filler. In order to obtain the optimum reinforcement properties imparted by a filler, the filler should be present in the elastomeric matrix in a final form which is both as finely divided as possible and distributed as homogeneously as possible.<br>
Filler particles tend to attract to one another and agglomerate within the elastomeric matrix. As such, there is a reduction in the number of filler -elastomer bonds created during the mixing process. As a result of these interactions the consistency of the rubber composition increases and makes processing more difficult.<br>
3<br><br>
Rubber compositions reinforced with fillers, such as, aluminas or aluminum (oxide-)hydroxides, of high dispersibility, and sulfur- vulcanizab Ie diene rubber composition, reinforced with a special precipitated silica of the highly dispersible type, are know in the art. Use of these fillers makes it possible to obtain tires or treads with improved rolling resistance, without adversely affecting the other properties, in particular those of grip, endurance and wear resistance. Although the use of these specific, highly reinforcing, siliceous or aluminous fillers has reduced the difficulties of processing the rubber compositions that contain them, such rubber compositions are nevertheless more difficult to process than rubber compositions filled conventionally with carbon black.<br>
In particular, it is necessary to use a coupling agent, also known as a bonding agent, the function of which is to provide the connection between the surface of the filler particles and the elastomer, while facilitating the dispersion of this filler within the elastomeric matrix.<br>
Sulfur-containing coupling agents used for mineral-filled elastomers involve silanes in which two alkoxysilylalkyl groups are bound, each to one end of a chain of sulfur atoms. The two alkoxysilyl groups are bonded to the chain of sulfur atoms by two similar, and in most cases, identical, hydrocarbon fragments. The general silane structures just described, hereinafter referred to as "simple bis polysulfide silanes," usually contain a chain of three methylene groups as the two mediating hydrocarbon units. In some cases, the methylene chain is shorter, containing only one or two methylenes per chain. The use of these compounds is primarily as coupling agents for mineral-filled elastomers. These coupling agents function by chemically bonding silica or other mineral fillers to polymer when used in rubber applications. Coupling is accomplished by chemical bond formation between the silane sulfur and the polymer and by hydrolysis of the alkoxysilyl groups and subsequent condensation with silica hydroxyl groups. The reaction of the silane sulfur with the polymer occurs when the S-S bonds are broken and the resulting fragment adds to the polymer. A single linkage to the polymer occurs for each silyl group bonded to the silica. This linkage contains a single, relatively weak C-S and/or S-S bond(s) that forms the weak link between the polymer and the silica. Under high stress, this single C-S and/or S-S linkages may break and therefore contribute to wear of the filled elastomer.<br>
The use of polysulfide silanes coupling agents in the preparation of rubber is well known. These silanes contain two silicon atoms, each of which is bound to a disubstituted hydrocarbon group, and three other groups of which at least one is removable from silicon by hydrolysis. Two such hydrocarbon groups, each with their bound silyl group, are further bound to each end of a chain of at least two<br>
4<br><br>
sulfur atoms. These structures thus contain two silicon atoms and a single, continuous chain of sulfur atoms of variable length.<br>
Hydrocarbon core polysulfide silanes that feature a central molecular core isolated from the silicon in the molecule by sulfur-sulfur bonds are known in the art. Polysufide silanes containing a core that is an aminoalkyl group separated from the silicon atom by a single sulfur and a polysulfide group and where the polysulfide group is bonded to the core at a secondary carbon atom are also know in the art. As well as core fragments in which only two polysulfide groups are attached to the core.<br>
However, polysulfide groups that are attached directly to an aromatic core have reduced reactivity with the polymer (rubber). The aromatic core is sterically bulky which inhibits the reaction. Compositions in which the polysulfides are attached directly to cyclic aliphatic fragments derived by vinyl cyclohexene contain more than one silated core and form large rings. The cyclohexyl core is sterically more hindered than the aromatic core and is less reactive. Although these compositions can form more than one sulfur linkage to the polymer rubber for each attachment of the coupling agent to the silica through the silyl group, their effectiveness is low due to the low reactivity.<br>
The low reactivity is due to the attachment of the polysulfide to the secondary carbon of cyclic core structure. The positioning of the polysulfide group is not optimal for reaction with the accelerators and reaction with the polymer.<br>
The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the aforementioned compositions involving silane coupling agents in several ways. The silanes of the present invention described herein are not limited to two silyl groups nor to one chain of sulfur atoms. In fact the molecular architecture in which multiple polysulfide chains are oriented in a noncollinear configuration (i.e. branched, in the sense that the branch points occur within the carbon backbone interconnecting the polysulfide chains) is novel.<br>
The fillers of the present invention have advantages over that in the prior art by providing a means to multiple points of sulfur attachment to polymer per point of silicon attachment to filler. The silanes of the fillers described herein may be asymmetric with regard to the groups on the two ends of the sulfur chains. The silyl groups, rather than occurring at the ends of the molecule, tend to occur more centrally and are chemically bonded to the core through carbon-carbon or carbon-silicon bonds. The core also contains multiple polysulfide groups that are<br>
5<br><br>
attached to a primary carbon atom. The attachment decreases significantly the steric hinderance of the core, and increases the reactivity of the polysulfides with the polymer. This distinction is what allows silane silicon to become and remain bonded (through the intermediacy of a sequence of covalent chemical bonds) to polymer at multiple points using the silanes of the present invention.<br>
Also, without being bound by theory, silated core silanes of the present invention include a Y-core structure. This Y-core structure is believed to enable bonding the polymer at two different points or crosslinking on two different polymer chains, and also enables attachment, such as by bonding, to a filler.<br>

According to another embodiment of the present invention, 30 to 99 weight percent of the silated core polysulfide of the filler composition of the present invention is blended with 70 to 1 weight percent of another silane, including silanes of the structure represented in Formula (4)<br><br>
wherein each occurrence of each occurrence of R1 and R3 are chosen independently from a divalent hydrocarbon fragment having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms that include branched and straight chain alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or aralkyl groups in which one hydrogen atom was substituted with a silyl group, (-SiX^X3), wherein X1 is chosen independently from the set of hydrolyzable groups consisting of -CI, -Br, -OH, -OR6, and R6C(=0)0-, in which R6 is any monovalent hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and includes branched or straight chain alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or aralkyl group and X2 and X3 is chosen independently taken from the group consisting of hydrogen, the members listed above for R6, the members listed above for X1 and -OSi containing groups that result from the condensation of silanols. This mixture of the silated core polysulfide of Formula (1) and the other silanes of Formula (4) correspond to about 0.43 to 99. In another embodiment, the mixture of the silated core polysulfide of of Formula (1) and the other silanes of Formula (4) are in a weight ratio of about 1 to 19.<br>

Patent 3,842,111, which is incorporated herein by reference, and include bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) trisulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide; bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) pentasulfide; bis-(3-diethoyxmethylsilypropyl) disulfide; bis-triethoxysilylmethyl disulfide; bis-(4-triethoxysilylbenzyl) disulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilylphenyl) disulfide; and the like.<br>

The bonding of sulfur to a methylene group on R4 and R5 is required because the methylene group mitigates excessive steric interactions between the silane and the filler and polymer. Two successive methylene groups mitigate steric interactions even further and also add flexibility to the chemical structure of the silane, thereby enhancing its ability to accommodate the positional and orientational constraints imposed by the morphologies of the surfaces of both the rubber and filler at the interphase, at the molecular level. The silane flexibility becomes increasingly important as the total number of silicon and sulfur atoms bound to G1 and G2 increases from 3 to 4 and beyond. Structures in which the polysulfide group is bonded directly to secondary and tertiary carbon atoms, ring structures, especially aromatic structures, are rigid and sterically hindered. The accelerators and curatives cannot readily orient themselves with the polysulfide group to affect reaction and the silated core polysulfide cannot readily orient itself to meet available binding sites on silica and polymer. This would tend to leave sulfur groups unbound to polymer, thereby reducing the efficiency by which the principle of multiple bonding of silane to polymer via multiple sulfur groups on silane, is realized.<br>
The function of the other silanes in the filler is to occupy sites on the surface of the silica which aid in dispersing the silica and coupling with the polymer.<br>
Fillers of the present invention can be used as carriers for liquid silanes and reinforcing fillers for elastomers in which the silated core polysulfide is capable of reacting or bonding with the surface. The fillers that are used as carrier should be non- reactive with the with the silated core polysulfide. The non-reactive nature of the fillers is demonstrated by ability of the silated core polysulfide to be extracted at greater than 50 percent of the loaded silane using an organic solvent. The extraction procedure is given in U. S. Patent 6,005,027, which is incorporated herein by reference. Carriers include, but are not limited to, porous organic polymers, carbon black, diatomaceous earth, and silicas that characterized by relatively low differential of less than 1.3 between the infrared absorbance at 3502 cm-2 of the silica when taken at 105 ยฐC and when taken at 500 ยฐC, as described in U. S. Patent 6,005,027. In one embodiment, the amount of silated core polysulfide and, optionally, the other silanes of Formula (4) that can be loaded on the carrier is between 0.1 and 70 percent. In another embodiment, the silated core polysulfide and, optionally, the other silanes of Formula (4) are load on the carrier at concentrations between 10 and 50 percent. In yet another embodiment, the filler is a particulate filler.<br>
Reinforcing fillers useful in the present invention include fillers in which the silanes are reactive with the surface of the filler. Representative examples of the fillers include, but are not limited to, inorganic fillers, siliceous fillers, metal<br>
18<br><br>
oxides such as silica (pyrogenic and/or precipitated), titanium, aluminosilicate and alumina, clays and talc, and the like. Particulate, precipitated silica is useful for such purpose, particularly when the silica has reactive surface silanols. In one embodiment of the present invention, a combination of 0.1 to 20 percent silated core polysulfide and optionally, the other silanes of Formula (4) and 80 to 99.9 percent silica or other reinforcing fillers is utilized to reinforce various rubber products, including treads for tires. In another embodiment, a filler is comprising from about 0.5 to about 10 percent silated core polysulfide of Formula (1) and optionally a second silane of Formula (4) and about 90 to about 99.5 weight percent particulate filler. In another embodiment of the present invention, alumina can be used alone with the silated core polysulfide, or in combination with silica and the silated core polysulfide. The term, alumina, can be described herein as aluminum oxide, or AI2O3. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the fillers may be in the hydrated form.<br>
Mercury porosity surface area is the specific surface area determined by mercury porosimetry. Using this method, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set up conditions may be suitably described as using about a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during about 2 hours at about 105 ยฐC and ambient atmospheric pressure; ambient to about 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, Shapiro in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 might be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the silica should be in a range of about 100 to about 300 m2/g.<br>
The pore size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is considered herein to be such that five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than about 10 nm, about 60 to about 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 10 to about 100 nm, about 10 to about 30 percent of its pores have a diameter at about 100 to about 1,000 nm, and about 5 to about 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1,000 nm.<br>
Silica might be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of about 10 to about 50 nm as determined by the electron microscope, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use in this invention such as, from PPG Industries under the HI-SIL trademark with designations HI-SIL 210, 243, etc.; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designation of ZEOSIL1165MP; silicas available from Degussa with, for<br>
19<br><br>
example, designations VN2 and VN3, etc. and silicas commercially available from Huber having, for example, a designation of HUBERSIL7 8745.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the filler compositions may utilize the silated core polysulfide with siliceous fillers such as silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicates in combination with carbon black reinforcing pigments. In another embodiment of the invention, the filler compositions may comprise a particulate filler mix of about 15 to about 95 weight percent of the siliceous filler, and about 5 to about 85 weight percent carbon black, and 0.1 to about 19 weight percent of silated core polysulfide/ wherein the carbon black has a CTAB value in a range of about 80 to about 150. In yet another embodiment of the invention, it is desirable to use a weight ratio of siliceous fillers to carbon black of at least about 3 to 1. In yet another embodiment, a weight ratio of siliceous fillers to carbon black of at least about 10 to 1. In still another embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of siliceous fillers to carbon black may range from about 3 to 1 to about 30 to 1.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the filler can be comprised of about 60 to about 95 weight percent of silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicate and, correspondingly, about 40 to about 5 weight percent carbon black and from about 0.1 to 20 weight percent silated core polysulfide of the present invention and optionally a second silane, with the proviso that the mixture of the components add up to 100 percent. The siliceous filler and carbon black may be pre-blended or blended together in the manufacture of the vulcanized rubber.<br>
The filler can be essentially inert to the silane with which it is admixed as is the case with carbon black or organic polymers, or it can be reactive therewith, e.g., the case with carriers possessing metal hydroxyl surface functionality, e.g., silicas and other siliceous particulates which possess surface silanol functionality.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a rubber composition is provided comprising:<br>
(a)	a rubber component;<br>
(b)	a free-flowing filler composition with a silated core polysulfide of Formula (1);<br>
(c)	and, optionally a second silane of Formula (4).<br>
20<br><br>
The silated core polysulfide silane(s) and optionally other silane coupling agents may be premixed or pre-reacted with the filler particles prior to the addition to the rubber mix, or added to a rubber mix during the rubber and filler processing, or mixing stages. If the silated core polysulfide silanes and, optionally, other silanes and filler are added separately to the rubber mix during the rubber and filler mixing, or processing stage, it is considered that the silated core polysulfide silane(s) then combine(s) in an in- situ fashion with the filler.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a cured rubber composition is provided comprising:<br>
(a)	a rubber component;<br>
(b)	a free-flowing filler composition with a silated core polysulfide of Formula (1)<br>

The rubbers useful with the filler compositions of the present invention include sulfur vulcanizable rubbers including conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers, and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound. Suitable organic polymers for preparation of rubber compositions are well known in the art and are described in various textbooks including The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook, Ohm, R.F., R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc., 1990 and in the Manual for the Rubber Industry, Kemperman, T and Koch, S. Jr., Bayer AG, LeverKusen, 1993.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the polymer for use herein is solution-prepared styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR). In another embodiment of the invention, the solution prepared SSBR typically has a bound styrene content in a range of about 5 to about 50 percent, and about 9 to about 36 percent in another embodiment. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the polymer may be selected from the group consisting of emulsion-prepared styrene-butadiene rubber (ESBR), natural rubber (NR), ethylene-propylene copolymers and terpolymers (EP, EPDM), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), polybutadiene (BR), and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the rubber composition is comprised of at least one diene-based elastomer, or rubber. Suitable conjugated dienes include, but are not<br>
21<br><br>
limited to, isoprene and l,3~butadiene and suitable vinyl aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to, styrene and alpha methyl styrene. Polybutadiene may be characterized as existing primarily, typically about 90% by weight, in the cis-l,4-butadiene form, but other compositions may also be used for the purposes described herein.<br>
Thus, the rubber is a sulfur curable rubber. Such diene based elastomer, or rubber, may be selected, for example, from at least one of cis-l,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural and/or synthetic), emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber, organic solution polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene rubber, 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, isoprene/butadiene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer rubber, cis-l,4-polybutadiene, medium vinyl polybutadiene rubber (35-50 percent vinyl), high vinyl polybutadiene rubber (50-75 percent vinyl), styrene/isoprene copolymers, emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile terpolymer rubber and butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubber. For some applications, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (ESBR) having a relatively conventional styrene content of about 20 to 28 percent bound styrene, or an ESBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content of about 30 to 45 percent may be used.<br>
Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile terpolymer rubbers containing 2 to 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention.<br>
The vulcanized rubber composition should contain a sufficient amount of filler composition to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. In one embodiment of the present invention, the combined weight of the filler composition may be as low as about 5 to about 100 parts per hundred parts (phr). In another embodiment, the combined weight of the filler composition is from about 25 to about 85 phr and at least one precipitated silica is utilized as a filler in another embodiment. The silica may be characterized by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, in the range of about 40 to about 600 m2/ g. In one embodiment of the invention, the silica has a BET surface area in a range of about 50 to about 300 m2/g. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica typically may also be characterized by having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of about 100 to about 350, and more usually about 150 to about 300. Further, the silica, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate, may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of about 100 to about 220. The CTAB surface area is the external<br>
22<br><br>
surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of about 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849.<br>
The rubber compositions of the present invention may be prepared by mixing one or more of the silated core polysulfide silanes and optionally other silaneswith the organic polymer before, during or after the compounding of the filler composition into the organic polymer. The silated core polysulfide silanes and optionally other silanes also may be added before or during the compounding of the filler composition into the organic polymer, because these silanes facilitate and improve the dispersion of the filler. In another embodiment, the total amount of silated core polysulfide silane present in the resulting combination should be about 0.05 to about 25 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of organic polymer (phr); and 1 to 10 phr in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, fillers can be used in quantities ranging from about 5 to about 120 phr, and still in another embodiment, fillers can be used in quantities ranging from about 25 to about 110 phr, or about 25 to about 105 phr.<br>
In practice, sulfur vulcanized rubber products typically are prepared by thermomechanically mixing rubber and various ingredients in a sequentially step-wise manner followed by shaping and curing the compounded rubber to form a vulcanized product. First, for the aforesaid mixing of the rubber and various ingredients, typically exclusive of sulfur and sulfur vulcanization accelerators (collectively, curing agents), the rubber(s) and various rubber compounding ingredients typically are blended in at least one, and often (in the case of silica filled low rolling resistance tires) two or more, preparatory thermomechanical mixing stage(s) in suitable mixers. Such preparatory mixing is referred to as nonproductive mixing or non-productive mixing steps or stages. Such preparatory mixing usually is conducted at temperatures of about 140 ยฐC to about 200 ยฐC, and for some compositions, about 150 ยฐC to about 170 ยฐC. Subsequent to such preparatory mix stages, in a final mixing stage, sometimes referred to as a productive mix stage, curing agents, and possibly one or more additional ingredients, are mixed with the rubber compound or composition, at lower temperatures of typically about 50 ยฐC to about 130 ยฐC in order to prevent or retard premature curing of the sulfur curable rubber, sometimes referred to as scorching. The rubber mixture, also referred to as a rubber compound or composition, typically is allowed to cool, sometimes after or during a process intermediate mill mixing, between the aforesaid various mixing steps, for example, to a temperature of about 50 ยฐC or lower. When it is desired to mold and to cure the rubber, the rubber is placed into the appropriate mold at a temperature of at least about 130 ยฐC and up to about 200 ยฐC which will cause the vulcanization of the rubber by the S-S bond-containing groups (i.e., disulfide,<br>
23<br><br>
trisulfide, tetrasulfide, etc.; polysulfide) on the silated core polysulfide silanes and any other free sulfur sources in the rubber mixture.<br>
Thermomechanical mixing refers to the phenomenon whereby under the high shear conditions in a rubber mixer, the shear forces and associated friction occurring as a result of mixing the rubber compound, or some blend of the rubber compound itself and rubber compounding ingredients in the high shear mixer, the temperature autogeneously increases, i.e. it "heats up". Several chemical reactions may occur at various steps in the mixing and curing processes.<br>
The first reaction is a relatively fast reaction and is considered herein to take place between the filler and the silicon alkoxide group of the silated core polysulfides. Such reaction may occur at a relatively low temperature such as, for example, at about 120 ยฐC. The second reaction is considered herein to be the reaction which takes place between the sulfur-containing portion of the silated core polysulfide silane, and the sulfur vulcanizable rubber at a higher temperature; for example, above about 140 ยฐC<br>
Another sulfur source may be used, for example, in the form of elemental sulfur, such as but not limited to Sg. A sulfur donor is considered herein as a sulfur containing compound which liberates free, or elemental sulfur, at a temperature in a range of about 140 ยฐC to about 190 ยฐC. Such sulfur donors may be, for example, although are not limited to, polysulfide vulcanization accelerators and organosilane polysulfides with at least two connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfide bridge. The amount of free sulfur source addition to the mixture can be controlled or manipulated as a matter of choice relatively independently from the addition of the aforesaid silated core polysulfide silane. Thus, for example, the independent addition of a sulfur source may be manipulated by the amount of addition thereof and by the sequence of addition relative to the addition of other ingredients to the rubber mixture.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the rubber composition may therefore comprise about 100 parts by weight rubber (phr) of at least one sulfur vulcanizable rubber selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers, and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound, about 5 to 100 phr, preferably about 25 to 80 phr of at least one filler, up to about 5 phr curing agent, and about 0.05 to about 25 phr of at least one silated core polysulfide silane as described in the present invention.<br>
24<br><br>
In another embodiment the filler composition comprises from about 1 to about 85 weight percent carbon black based on the total weight of the filler composition and 2 to about 20 parts by weight of at least one silated core polysulfide silane of the present invention based on the total weight of the filler composition.<br>
The rubber composition may be prepared by first blending rubber, filler and silated core polysulfide silane, or rubber, filler pretreated with all or a portion of the silated core polysulfide silane and any remaining silated core polysulfide silane, in a first thermomechanical mixing step to a temperature of about 140 ยฐC to about 200 ยฐC for about 2 to about 20 minutes. The fillers may be pretreated with all or a portion of the silated core polysulfide silane and any remaining silated core polysulfide silane, in a first thermomechanical mixing step to a temperature of about 140 ยฐC to about 200 ยฐC for about 4 to 15 minutes. Optionally, the curing agent is then added in another thermomechanical mixing step at a temperature of about 50 ยฐC and mixed for about 1 to about 30 minutes. The temperature is then heated again to between about 130ยฐC and about 200 ยฐC and curing is accomplished in about 5 to about 60 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the process may also comprise the additional steps of preparing an assembly of a tire or sulfur vulcanizable rubber with a tread comprised of the rubber composition prepared according to this invention and vulcanizing the assembly at a temperature in a range of about 130 ยฐC to about 200 ยฐC<br>
Other optional ingredients may be added in the rubber compositions of the present invention including curing aids, i.e. sulfur compounds, including activators, retarders and accelerators, processing additives such as oils, plasticizers, tackifying resins, silicas, other fillers, pigments, fatty acids, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents, reinforcing materials such as, for example, carbon black, and so forth. Such additives are selected based upon the intended use and on the sulfur vulcanizable material selected for use, and such selection is within the knowledge of one of skill in the art, as are the required amounts of such additives known to one of skill in the art.<br>
s<br>
The vulcanization may be conducted in the presence of additional sulfur vulcanizing agents. Examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include, for example elemental sulfur (free sulfur) or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an amino disulfide, polymeric polysulfide or sulfur olefin adducts which are conventionally added in the final, productive, rubber composition mixing step. The sulfur vulcanizing agents, which are common in the art are<br>
25<br><br>
used, or added in the productive mixing stage, in an amount ranging from about 0.4 to about 3 phf/ or even, in some circumstances, up to about 8 phr, with a range of from about 1.5 to about 2.5 phr and all subranges therebetween in one embodiment from 2 to about 2.5 phr and all subranges therebetween in another embodiment.<br>
Optionally, vulcanization accelerators, i.e., additional sulfur donors, may be used<br>
herein. It is appreciated that may include the following examples, benzothiazole,<br>
alkyl thiuram disulfide, guanidine derivatives and thiocarbamates.<br>
Representative of such accelerators can be, but not limited to, mercapto<br>
benzothiazole (MBT), tetramethyl thiuram disulfide(TMTD), tetramethyl thiuram<br>
monosulfide (TMTM), benzothiazole disulfide (MBTS), diphenylguanidine<br>
(DPG), zinc dithiocarbamate (ZBEC), alkylphenoldisulfide, zinc iso-propyl<br>
xanthate (ZIX), N-dicyclohexyI-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (DCBS), N-<br>
cyclohexyl-2-benzc?thiazolesuIfenamide	(CBS),	N-tert-buyl-2-<br>

Other additional sulfur donors, may be, for example, thiuram and morpholine derivatives. Representative of guch donors are, for example, but not limited to, dimorpholine disulfide, dimorpholine tetrasulfide, tetramethyl thiuram tetrasulfide, benzothiazyl-2,N-Jithiomorpholide , thioplasts, dipentamethylenethiuram hexasulfide, and disulfidecaprolactam.<br>
Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., a primary accelerator. Conventionally, a primary accelerator(s) is used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4 phr and all subranges therebetween in one embodiment, and from about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr and all subranges therebetween in another embodiment. Combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts (of about 0.05 to about 3 phr and all subranges therebetween) in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Delayed action accelerators may be used. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfanamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. In one embodiment, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator can be a guanidine,     dithiocarbamate     and/or     thiuram     compounds.     Preferably,<br>
26<br><br>
tetrabenzylthiuram disulfide is utilized as a secondary accelerator in combination with N-tert- buyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide with or without diphenylguanidine. Tetrabenzylthiuram disulfide is a preferred accelerator as it does not lead to the production of nitrosating agents, such as, for example, tetramethylthiuram disulfide.<br>
Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise about 0.5 to about 10 phr and all subranges therebetween, usually about 1 to about 5 phr and all subranges therebetween. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise about 1 to about 50 phr and all subranges therebetween. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, napthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants, comprise about 1 to about 5 phr and all subranges therebetween. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid, comprise about 0.5 to about 3 phr and all subranges therebetween. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise about 2 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise about 1 to about 5 phr and all subranges therebetween. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise about 0.1 to about 1 phr and all subranges therebetween. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide.<br>
The rubber compositions of this invention can be used for various purposes.For example, it can be used for various tire compounds, weather stripping, and shoe soles. In one embodiment of the present invention, the rubber compositions described herein are particularly useful in tire treads, but may also be used for all other parts of the tire as well. The tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art.<br>

Comparative Example A-E. Examples 3-7 The Use of Silanes in Low Rolling Resistant Tire Tread Formulation<br>
A model low rolling resistance passenger tire tread formulation as described in Table 1 and a mix procedure were used to evaluate representative examples of the silanes of the present invention. The silane in Example 2 was mixed as follows in a "B" BANBURYยฎ (Farrell Corp.) mixer with a 103 cu. in. (1690 cc) chamber volume. The mixing of the rubber was done in two steps. The mixer was turned on with the mixer at 80 rpm and the cooling water at 71 ยฐC. The rubber polymers were added to the mixer and ram down mixed for 30 seconds. The silica and the other ingredients in Masterbatch of Table 1 except for the silane and the oils were added to the mixer and ram down mixed for 60 seconds. The mixer speed was reduced to 35 rpm and then the silane and oils of the Materbatch were added to the mixer and ram down for 60 seconds. The mixer throat was dusted down and the ingredients ram down mixed until the temperature reached 149 ยฐC. The ingredients were then mixed for an addition 3 minutes and 30 seconds. The mixer speed was adjusted to hold the temperature between 152 and 157 ยฐC. The rubber was dumped (removed from the mixer), a sheet was formed on a roll mill set at about 85ยฐ to 88 ยฐC, and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
In the second step, Masterbatch was recharged into the mixer. The mixer's speed was 80 rpm, the cooling water was set at 71 ยฐC and the batch pressure was set at 6MPa. The Masterbatch was ram down mixed for 30 seconds and then the temperature of the Masterbatch was brought up to 149 ยฐC, and then the mixer's<br>
31<br><br>
speed was reduce to 32 rpm. The rubber was mixed for 3 minutes and 20 seconds at temperatures between 152 and 157 ยฐC After mixing, the rubber was dumped (removed from the mixer), a sheet was formed on a roll mill set at about 85ยฐ to 88 ยฐC, and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
The rubber Masterbatch and the curatives were mixed on a 15 cm x 33 cm two roll mill that was heated to between 48ยฐ and 52 ยฐC. The sulfur and accelerators were added to the rubber (Masterbatch) and thoroughly mixed on the roll mill and allowed to form a sheet. The sheet was cooled to ambient conditions for 24 hours before it was cured. The curing condition was 160 ยฐC for 20 minutes. Silane from Example 2 was compounded into the tire tread formulation according to the above procedure. The performance of the silane prepared in Examples 2 was compared to the performance of silanes which are practiced in the prior art, bis-(3-triethoxysilyl-l-propyl)disulfide (TESPD), and propyltriethoxysilane, Comparative Examples A-E.

The results of this procedure are tabulated below in Table 1.<br>
Table 1, listed in Examples 3 -7, presents the performance parameters of silated core polysulfide of the present invention TESPD, and propyltriethoxysilane. The physical   properties   of   the   rubber   compounded   with   filer   compositions<br>

comprising the silane from Example 2 are consistently and substantially higher than the control silanes.<br>
The filler compositions comprising the silated core polysulfide silanes of the present invention impart superior performance to silica- filled elastomer compositions, including better coupling of the silica to the rubber, as illustrated by the higher reinforcement index. The better reinforcing index translates into performance improvements for the rubber compositions and articles manufactured from these rubbers.<br>
