INHIBITION OF RAF KINASE USING SUBSTITUTED HETEROCYCLIC UREAS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the us eof a group of aryl ureas in treating raf mediated diseases, and pharmaceutical compositions for use in such therapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The p21ru oncogene is a major contributor to the development and progression of human solid cancers and is mutated in 30% of all human cancers (Bolton'et al. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1994, 29, 165-74; Bos. Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 4682-9).    In its normal, unmutated form, the ras protein is a key element of the signal transduction cascade directed by growth factor receptors in almost all tissues (Avruch et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994, 19, 279-83). Biochemically, ras is a guanine nucleotide binding protein, and cycling between a GTP-bound activated and a GDP-bound resting form is strictly controlled by ras' endogenous GTPase activity and other regulatory proteins. In the ras mutants in cancer cells, the endogenous GTPase activity is alleviated and, therefore, the protein delivers constitutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as the enzyme raf kinase. This leads to the cancerous growth of the cells which carry these mutants (Magnuson et al. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994, 5, 247-53).  It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of active ras by inhibiting the raf kinase signaling pathway by administration of deactivating antibodies to raf kinase or by co-expression of dominant negative raf kinase or dominant negative MEK, the substrate of raf kinase, leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the normal growth phenotype (see: Daum et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994,19,474-80; Fridman et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994,269, 30105-8. Kolch et al. {Nature 1991, 349,426-28) have further indicated that inhibition of raf expression by antisense RNA blocks cell proliferation in membrane-associated oncogenes.  Similarly, inhibition of raf kinase (by antisense ohgodeoxynucleotides) has been correlated in vitro and in vivo with inhibition of the growth of a variety of human tumor types (Monia et al., Nat. Med. 1996, 2,668-75).<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides compounds which are inhibitors of the enzyme raf kinase. Since the enzyme is a downstream effector of p21n,I the instant inhibitors are useful in pharmaceutical compositions for human or veterinary use where inhibition of the raf kinase pathway is indicated, e.g., in the treatment of tumors and/or cancerous cell growth mediated by raf kinase. In particular, the compounds are useful in the treatment of human or animal, e.g., murine cancer, since the progression of these cancers is dependent upon the ras protein signal transduction cascade and therefore susceptible to treatment by interruption of the cascade, i.e., by inhibiting raf kinase. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating solid cancers, such as, for example, carcinomas (e.g., of the lungs, pancreas, thyroid, bladder or colon, myeloid disorders (e.g., myeloid leukemia) or adenomas (e.g., villous colon adenoma).<br>
The present invention therefore provides compounds generally described as aryl ureas, including both aryl and heteroaryl analogues, which inhibit the raf pathway. The invention also provides a method for treating a raf mediated disease state in humans or mammals. Thus, the invention is directed to compounds and methods for the treatment of cancerous cell growth mediated by raf kinase comprising administering a compound of formula I:<br>

The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of formula<br>
I. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
and include basic salts of inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid,<br>

acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid,<br>
oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid,<br>
phenylacetic acid, and mandelic acid. In addition, pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include acid salts of inorganic bases, such as salts containing alkaline cations (e.g., Li*<br>
Na+ or K+), alkaline earth cations (e.g., Mg*2, Ca*2 or Ba*2), the ammonium cation, as<br>
well as acid salts of organic bases, including aliphatic and aromatic substituted<br>

(DABCO),	l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene	(DBN)	and	1,8-<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene(DBU).<br>
A number of the compounds of Formula I possess asymmetric carbons and can therefore exist in racemic and optically active forms. Methods of separation of enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures are well known to one skilled in the art. The present invention encompasses any isolated racemic or optically active form of compounds described in Formula I which possess Raf kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
General Preparative Methods<br>
The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures, some of which are commercially available. Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are presented to aid one of skill in the art in synthesizing the inhibitors, with more detailed examples being presented in the experimental section describing the working examples.<br>
Heterocyclic amines may be synthesized utilizing known methodology (Katritzky, et al. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry; Permagon Press: Oxford, UK (1984). March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3"1 Ed.; John Wiley: New York (1985)).  For<br><br>
example, 3-substitutcd-5-aminoisoxazoIes (3) are available by the reaction of hydroxylamine with an a-cyanoketone (2), as shown in Scheme I. Cyanoketone 2, in turn, is available from the reaction of acetamidate ion with an appropriate acyl derivative, such as an ester, an acid halide, or an acid anhydride. Reaction of an -cyanoketone with hydrazine (R2=H) or a monosubstituted hydrazine affords the 3-substituted- or l,3-disubstituted-5-aminopyrazole (5). Pyrazoles unsubstituted at N-l (R2=H) may be acylated at //-l, for example using di-ter/-butyl dicarbonate, to give pyrazole 7. Similarly, reaction of nitrile 8 with an -thioacetate ester gives the 5-substituted-3-amino-2-thiophenecarboxylate (9, Ishizaki et al. JP 6025221). Decarboxylation of ester 9 may be achieved by protection of the amine, for example as the tert-bntoxy (BOC) carbamate (10), followed by saponification and treatment with acid. When BOC protection is used, decarboxylation may be accompanied by deprotection giving the substituted 3-thiopheneammonium salt 11. Alternatively, ammonium salt 11 may be directly generated through saponification of ester 9 followed by treatment with acid.<br><br><br>
Scheme I.      Selected General Methods for Heterocyclic Amine Synthesis<br>
Substituted anilines may be generated using standard methods (March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.; John Wiley: New York (1985); Larock. Comprehensive Organic Transformations; VCH Publishers: New York (1989)). As shown in Scheme II, aryl amines are commonly synthesized by reduction of nitroaryls using a metal catalyst, such as Ni, Pd, or Pt, and H2 or a hydride transfer agent, such as formate, cyclohexadiene, or a borohydride (Rylander. Hydrogenation Methods; Academic Press: London, UK (1985)). Nitroaryls may also be directly reduced using a strong hydride source, such as LiAlH4 (Seyden-Penne. Reductions by the Alumino- and Borohydrides in Organic Synthesis; VCH Publishers: New York (1991)), or using a<br><br>
zero valent metal, such as Fe, Sn or Ca, often in acidic media. Many methods exist for the synthesis of nitroaryls (March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.; John Wiley: New York (1985). Larock. Comprehensive Organic Transformations; VCH Publishers: New York (1989)).<br><br>
Scheme II      Reduction of Nitroaryls to Aryl Amines<br>
Nitroaiyls are commonly formed by electrophilic aromatic nitration using HN03, or an alternative N02+ source. Nitroaryls may be further elaborated prior to reduction. Thus, nitroaryls substituted with<br>
HN03<br>
Ar-H      	►   ArN02<br>
potential leaving groups (eg. F, CI, Br, etc.) may undergo substitution reactions on treatment with nucleophiles, such as thiolate (exemplified in Scheme HI) or phenoxide.   Nitroaryls may also undergo Ullman-type coupling reactions (Scheme<br><br>
Scheme III     Selected Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution using Nitroaryls<br>
As shown in Scheme IV, urea formation may involve reaction of a heteroaryl isocyanate (17) with an aryl amine (16).    The heteroaryl isocyanate may be<br><br>
synthesized from a heteroaryl amine by treatment with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent, such as trichloromethyl chloroformate (diphosgene), bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate (triphosgene), or A^A^'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). The isocyanate may also be derived from a heterocyclic carboxylic acid derivative, such as an ester, an acid halide or an anhydride by a Curtius-type rearrangement. Thus, reaction of acid derivative 21 with an azide source, followed by rearrangement affords the isocyanate. The corresponding carboxylic acid (22) may also be subjected to Curtius-type rearrangements using diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) or a similar reagent. A urea may also be generated from the reaction of an aryl isocyanate (20) with a heterocyclic amine.<br><br>
Scheme rv    Selected Methods of Urea Formation (Het = heterocycle)<br>
l-Amino-2-heterocyclic carboxylic esters (exemplified with thiophene 9, Scheme V) may be converted into an isatoic-like anhydride (25) through saponification, followed by treatment with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent. Reaction of anhydride 25 with an aryl amine can generate acid 26 which may spontaneously decarboxylate, or may be isolated. If isolated, decarboxylation of acid 26 may be induced upon heating.<br><br><br>
Scheme V      Urea Formation via Isatoic-Hke Anhydrides<br>
Finally, ureas may be further manipulated using methods familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions including a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a physiologically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or sublingually, rectally or vaginally in dosage unit formulations. The term 'administration by injection' includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, as well as use of infusion techniques. Dermal administration may include topical application or transdermal administration. One or more compounds may be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and if desired other active ingredients.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any suitable method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of diluents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in<br><br>
order to provide palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, com starch, or alginic acid; and binding agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
In Vitro raf Kinase Assay:<br>
In an in vitro kinase assay, raf is incubated with MEK in 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.2 containing 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 mM NaCl. This protein solution (20 (iL) is mixed with water (5 uL) or with compounds diluted with distilled water from 10 mM stock solutions of compounds dissolved in DMSO. The kinase reaction is initiated by adding 25 uL [y-"P]ATP (1000*3000 dpm/pmol) in 80 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM DTT, 16 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixtures are incubated at 32 °C, usually for 22 min. Incorporation of "P into protein is assayed by harvesting the reaction onto phosphocellulose mats, washing away free counts with a 1% phosphoric acid solution and quantitating phosphorylation by liquid scintillation counting. For high throughput screening, 10 jiM ATP and 0.4 jiM MEK are used. In some experiments, the kinase reaction is stopped by adding an equal amount of Laemmli sample buffer.   Samples are boiled 3 min and the proteins resolved by<br>
-M^L~<br><br>
electrophoresis on 7.5% Laemmli gels. Gels are fixed, dried and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji). Phosphorylation is analyzed using a Fujix Bio-Imaging Analyzer System.<br>
All compounds exemplified displayed ICJ0s of between 1 nM and 10 p.M.<br>
Cellular Assay:<br>
For in vitro growth assay, human tumor cell lines, including but not limited to HCT116 and DLD-1, containing mutated K-ras genes are used in standard proliferation assays for anchorage dependent growth on plastic or anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Human tumor cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville MD) and maintained in RPMI with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 200 mM glutamine. Cell culture media and additives are obtained from Gibco/BRL (Gaithersburg, MD) except for fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). In a standard proliferation assay for anchorage dependent growth, 3 X 103 cells are seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C in a 5% C02 incubator. Compounds are titrated in media in dilution series and added to 96 well cell cultures. Cells are allowed to grow 5 days typically with a feeding of fresh compound containing media on day three. Proliferation is monitored by measuring metabolic activity with standard XTT colorimetric assay (Boehringer Mannheim) measured by standard ELISA plate reader at OD 490/560, or by measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA following an 8 h culture with 1 fiCu 3H-thymidine, harvesting the cells onto glass fiber mats using a cell harvester and measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation by liquid scintillant counting.<br>
For anchorage independent cell growth, cells are plated at 1 x 103 to 3 x 103 in 0.4% Seaplaque agarose in RPMI complete media, overlaying a bottom layer containing only 0.64% agar in RPMI complete media in 24-well tissue culture plates. Complete media plus dilution series of compounds are added to wells and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% C02 incubator for 10-14 days with repeated feedings of fresh media containing compound at 3-4 day intervals. Colony formation is monitored and total cell mass, average colony size and number of colonies are quantitated using image capture technology and image analysis software (Image Pro Plus, media Cybernetics).<br><br>
These assays establish that the compounds of Formula I are active to inhibit raf kinase activity and to inhibit oncogenic cell growth.<br>
In Vivo Assay:<br>
An in vivo assay of the inhibitory effect of the compounds on tumors (e.g., solid cancers) mediated by raf kinase can be performed as follows:<br>
CDI nu/nu mice (6-8 weeks old) are injected subcutaneously into the flank at 1 x 106 cells with human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. The mice are dosed i.p., i.v. or p.o. at 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/Kg beginning on approximately day 10, when tumor size is between 50-100 mg. Animals are dosed for 14 consecutive days once a day; tumor size was monitored with calipers twice a week.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the compounds on raf kinase and therefore on tumors (e.g., solid cancers) mediated by raf kinase can further be demonstrated in vivo according to the technique of Monia et al. (Nat. Med. 1996, 2, 668-75).<br>
