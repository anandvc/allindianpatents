				<td>GYPSUM COMPOSITIONS WITH ENHANCED RESISTANCE TO<br>
PERMANENT DEFORMATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to gypsum<br>
compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to set gypsum<br>
compositions that exhibit enhanced resistance to permanent<br>
deformation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Set gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) is a well-known material<br>
that is included commonly in many types of products. By way of<br>
example, set gypsum is a major component of end products created<br>
by the use of traditional plasters (e.g., plaster-surfaced internal<br>
building walls) and also in paper-faced gypsum boards employed in<br>
typical drywall construction of interior walls and cettings of buildings.<br>
In addition, set gypsum is the major component of gypsum/ceflulose<br>
fiber composite boards and products, and also is included in products<br>
that fill and smooth the joints between edges of gypsum boards. Also,<br>
many specialty materials, such as materials useful for modeling and<br>
mold-making that are precisely machined, produce products that<br>
contain major amounts of set gypsum.<br>
Typically, such gypsum-containing products are prepared by<br>
forming a mixture of calcined gypsum (calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
and/or calcium sulfate anhydrite) and water (and other components,<br>
as appropriate). The mixture is cast into a desired shape or onto a<br>
surface, and then allowed to harden to form set (i.e., rehydrated)<br>
gypsum by reaction of the calcined gypsum with the water to form a<br>
matrix of crystalline hydrated gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate). It is<br>
the desired hydration of the calcined gypsum mat enables the<br>
formation of an interlocking matrix of set gypsum crystals, thus<br><br>
imparting strength to the gypsum structure in the gypsum-containing<br>
product. Mild heating is utilized to drive off the remaining free (i.e.,<br>
unreacted) water to yield a dry product.<br>
One problem with such gypsum-containing products is that they<br>
often are subject to permanent deformation (e.g., sag), especially<br>
under conditions of high humidity, temperature, or load. For example,<br>
the possibility of sag is particularry problematic where gypsum-<br>
containing boards and tiles are stored or employed in a manner in<br>
which they are positioned horizontally. In this respect, if the set<br>
gypsum matrix in these products is not sufficiently resistant to<br>
permanent deformation, the products may start to sag in areas<br>
between the points to which they are fastened, or supported by, an<br>
underlying structure. This can be unsightly and can cause difficulties<br>
during use of the products. Furthermore, in many applications,<br>
gypsum-containing products must be able to carry toads, e.g.,<br>
insulation or condensation loads, without perceptible sag.<br>
Another problem with such set gypsum-containing products is<br>
that dimensional stability can be compromised during their<br>
manufacture, processing, and commercial application. For example,<br>
in the preparation of set gypsum products, there is usually a<br>
significant amount of tree (i.e., unreacted) water left in the matrix after<br>
the gypsum has set Upon drying of the set gypsum in order to drive<br>
off the excess water, the interlocking set gypsum crystals in the matrix<br>
tend to move closer together as the water evaporates. In mis respect,<br>
as the water leaves the crystal interstices of the gypsum matrix, the<br>
matrix tends to shrink from natural forces of the set gypsum that were<br>
resisting capillary pressure applied by the water on the gypsum<br>
crystals. As the amount of water in the aqueous calcined gypsum<br>
mixture increases, lack of dimensional stability becomes more of a<br>
problem.<br><br>
Dimensional stability is also of concern even after the final<br>
dried product is realized, especially under conditions of changing<br>
temperature and humidity where set gypsum is susceptible to, for<br>
example, expansion and shrinkage. For example, moisture taken up<br>
in crystal interstices of a gypsum matrix of a gypsum board or tile<br>
exposed to high humidity and temperature can aggravate a sagging<br>
problem by causing the humidified board to expand.<br>
If such dimensional instability could be avoided or minimized,<br>
various benefits would result For example, existing gypsum board<br>
production methods would yield more product if the boards did not<br>
shrink during drying, and gypsum-containing products desired to be<br>
relied upon to hold a precise shape and dimensional proportions (e.g.,<br>
for use in modeling and mold making) would serve their purposes<br>
better.<br>
Accordingly, it wi be appreciated from the foregoing that there<br>
is a need in the art for a set gypsum composition exhibiting enhanced<br>
resistance to permanent deformation (e.g., sag) and enhanced<br>
dimensional stability. The invention provides such a set gypsum<br>
composition satisfying at least one of these needs. These and other<br>
advantages of the present invention, as well as additional inventive<br>
features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided<br>
herein.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a set gypsum composition that<br>
demonstrates enhanced resistance to permanent deformation (e.g.,<br>
sag) and/or enhanced dimensional stability.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a set gypsum-<br>
containing composition comprising an interlocking matrix of set<br>
gypsum formed from, i.e.. using, at least calcined gypsum, water, and<br><br>
an enhancing material comprising (i) an organic poiyphosphonic<br>
compound, or a mixture of such compounds; (ii) a borate selected<br>
from uloxite, colemanite, or a mixture of ulexite and cotemanlte; or a<br>
mixture of one or more organic poiyphosphonic compounds and one<br>
or more borates. In some embodiments, the present invention<br>
provides for the introduction of borate enhancing material into the set<br>
gypsum-containing composition by means other than its direct<br>
addition to the aforesaid aqueous composition. For example, the<br>
borate may be carried on an accelerator material. In this respect, the<br>
borate may be introduced into the aqueous composition in the form of<br>
a milled mixture of borate and an accelerator material, particularly,<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate (e.g., gypsum seeds).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a set<br>
gypsum-containing composition comprising an interlocking matrix of<br>
set gypsum formed from, i.e., using, at least calcined gypsum, water,<br>
and an enhancing material comprising (i) a poiycarboxylic compound<br>
or a mixture of porycarboxylic compounds; and (ii) a polyphosphate<br>
compound or a mixture of polyphoaphate compounds. In a further<br>
aspect of the invention, the porycarboxylic compounds or<br>
poiyphosphate compounds, alone or in combination, can be used with<br>
the organic polyphoapnonic compounds or the borates described<br>
above, or both.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a set<br>
gypsum-containing composition comprising set gypsum (e.g., an<br>
interlocking set gypsum matrix). The set gypsum is treated in a post-<br>
set treatment process with an enhancing material which can be<br>
selected from (I) an organic phosphorite compound or a mixture of<br>
such compounds; (ii) a borate selected from ulexite, cotemanite, or a<br>
mixture of ulexite and cotemanite; (i) a carboxylic compound or a<br>
mixture of such compounds; or a mixture of (i), (ii) and/or (iii). The set<br><br>
gypsum product need not be dry when post-set treated, although it<br>
can be. In the post-set treatment aspect of the present invention, an<br>
inorganic phosphate compound also can be used in combination wtth<br>
one or more of the other aforementioned enhancing materials.<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention provides an<br>
accelerator for an aqueous calcined gypsum composition comprising<br>
a borate and an accelerator material.<br>
The Invention may best be understood with reference to the<br>
following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a set gypsum-containing<br>
composition that exhibits enhanced resistance to permanent<br>
deformation (e.g., sag) and/or enhanced dimensional stability. By<br>
way of example, the set gypsum-containing composition can be in the<br>
form of gypsum board.<br>
The set gvpsum-containing composition comprises an<br>
interlocking set gypsum matrix and is prepared from a mixture (e.g.,<br>
slurry or suspension) comprising water and calcined gypsum. The<br>
calcined gypsum can be fibrous or non-fibrous. Preferably, a major<br>
portion (e.g., at least SO wt.%) of the cakaned gypsum is non-fibrous.<br>
In some embodiments, the calcined gypsum consists essentially of<br>
non-fibrous calcined gypsum. In addition, the calcined gypsum can<br>
be in the form of alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate, beta calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrata, water-soluble calcium sutfata anhydrite, or<br>
mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, a major portion (e.g., at<br>
least 50 wt%) of the calcined gypsum is beta calclum sulfate<br>
hemihydrate. In some embodiments, the calcined gypsum consists<br>
essentially of beta calcium sulfats hemihydrate.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, one or more '<br>
enhancing materials is provided to impart the set gypsum-containing<br>
composition with enhanced sag resistance and/or dimensional<br>
stability. By way of example, the resistance to sag imparted by the<br>
enhancing materials advantageously provides the set gypsum-<br>
containingcomposition with a more stable form over time. For<br>
example, the sag resistance imparted by the enhancing material is<br>
beneficial in overcoming the presence of certain salts (e.g., chloride<br>
salts) that may be present as impurities in the aqueous calcined<br>
gypsum mixture and which might otherwise lead to sag during use. In<br>
addition, the enhanced dimensional stability (e.g., resistance to<br>
shrinkage) imparted by the enhancing materials is beneficial, for<br>
example, in resisting drying stresses, and hence shrinkage, during<br>
preparation, as well as in resisting dimensional expansion in<br>
operation.<br>
In some embodiments, the enhancing material is present in the<br>
aqueous mixture of calcined gypsum during the hydration of the<br>
calcined gypsum to form set gypsum (i.e., a ore-set treatment). In<br>
some pre-set treatment embodiments, suitable enhancing materials<br>
include, for example, (i) an organic potyphosphoruc compound, or a<br>
mixture thereof; (ii) a borate selected from uiexite, cotemanfte, or a<br>
mixture thereof, or a mixture of (I) and (ii). In addition, such<br>
embodiments optionally can include a second enhancing material<br>
selected from, for example, (iii) a polycerboxytic compound or a<br>
mixture thereof, (iv) a potyphosphate compound or a mixture thereof;<br>
or a mixture of (iii) and (iv). It wll be appreciated by those skised in<br>
the art that various combinations and permutations of the enhancing<br>
agents of the four groups (I) - (iv) of enhancing materials can be used<br>
in the practice of the present invention.<br><br>
In some pre-set treatments according to the invention, the<br>
enhancing material rnbod into the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture<br>
includes (i) a polycarboxyllc compound or a mixture of potycarboxylic<br>
compounds; and (ii) a polyphosphate compound or a mixture of<br>
polyphosphate compounds.<br>
Jn embodiments where the enhancing material is included in, or<br>
added to, the aqueous mixture of calcined gypsum during the<br>
hydratton of the calcined gypsum to form set gypsum, the enhancing<br>
material can be included at any suitable time, and in a variety of<br>
forms. By way of example, the enhancing material conveniently can<br>
be included in, or added to, the aqueous mixture, for example, prior to<br>
or when the water and calcined gypsum are normally brought together<br>
for mixing (e.g., in a mixing apparatus). Another possibility Is to mix<br>
the enhancing material with raw gypsum even before it is heated to<br>
form calcined gypsum, so that the enhancing material is already<br>
present when the calcined gypsum is mixed with water to cause<br>
rehydration.<br>
in addition, the enhancing material can be provided (e.g., by<br>
spraying) onto the already-mixed aqueous mixture of calcined gypsum<br>
after it is deposited onto a cover sheet (e.g., on a moving balt).<br>
Generally, a second cover sheet is then placed over the deposited<br>
mixture. In this manner.the sclution of ennancing matarial willsoak<br>
into the deposited mixture and be present when the bulk of the<br>
hydration to form set gypsum occurs.<br>
Other alternative methods of providing the enhancing material<br>
wHI be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and are considered<br>
within the scope of the invention. For example, one or both of the<br>
cover sheets can be pre-coated with the enhancing material, for<br>
example, so that the enhancing material will dissolve and migrate<br><br>
through the mixture when the deposit of the aqueous mixture of<br>
-calcined gypsum contacts the coated cover sheet.<br>
In come embodbnents where the borate it selected, at least<br>
some of the borate may be mixed and subsequently mitod with an<br>
accelerator material prior to introduction of the resulting millied mixture<br>
into the aqueous composition. In such embodiments, the accelerator<br>
material, i.e., calcium sulfate dihydrate, and the borate are mixed and<br>
then milled. While not desiring to be bound to any particular theory, it<br>
is believed that upon milling, the borate becomes affixed to the outer<br>
surface of the calcium sutfate dthydrate accelerator material, providing<br>
at least a partial coating layer on the material. Regardless of theory,<br>
however, the borate and accelerator combination, after miffing,<br>
desirably functions as an accelerator, and also provides the resulting<br>
gypsum product with enhanced sag resistance. The presence of the<br>
borate as an at least partial coating on the accelerator material<br>
desirably protects the activity of the accelerator by minimizing adverse<br>
interactions of the active sites of the accelerator with moisture (e.g.,<br>
during storage), thereby avoiding the need and associated expense of<br>
an additional coating material (e.g., sugar or boric acid). Ulexite and<br>
colemanlte are natural occurring boratas and are obtainable at much<br>
less expense than synthetic materials such as boric add.<br>
Advantageously, the borate-acceterator material mixture is<br>
roiled under conditions sufficient to provide the resulting mMed<br>
accelerator composition with a median particle size of less than about<br>
5m. Preferably, the miled composition further has a surface area of<br>
at least about 7,000 cm2/gram. A general procedure for effecting<br>
milling is provided in U.S. Patent 3,573,947, although heating is not<br>
necessary in some embodiments of the invention to make the borate<br>
coated accelerator described herein. The resulting mMed accelerator<br>
mixture then may be added to the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture<br><br>
in an amount effective to maintain control of the rate of conversion of<br>
the calcined gypsum mixture to set gypsum at the desired level. Of<br>
the boranae, ulexfte and cotemanite are particularly weH suited for this<br>
mode of introduction, with the former being most preferred.<br>
In some embodiments, the enhancing material is provided by<br>
treating the already-formed (or partially formed) set gypsum-<br>
containing composition comprising the set gypsum (i.e., a post-set<br>
treatment), in such embodiments, suitable enhancing materials<br>
include, for example, (i) an organic phosphonic compound, or a<br>
mixture thereof; (ii) a borate selected from ulexite, colemanite, or a<br>
mixture thereof; (iii) a carboxytic compound or a mixture thereof; or<br>
mixtures of (i), (ii) and/or (iii). Optionally, such embodiments can<br>
include a second enhancing material selected from, for example, a<br>
phosphate compound, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The treatment of the set gypsum-containing composition with<br>
the enhancing material can occur before or after the set gypsum<br>
composition is dried (e.g., in an oven or kiln) to drive off free (i.e.,<br>
unreacted) water. In this respect the enhancing material is applied<br>
(e.g., sprayed or soaked in a solution such as an aqueous solution<br>
containing, for example, from about 0.01% to about 2% of enhancing<br>
material) otto the set gypsum-containing composition in order to<br>
achieve the desired treatment Preferably, the treatment is applied<br>
price to dryirtg of the set gypeum-cortaing composing. If the<br>
treatment is applied after drying of the set gypsum-containing<br>
composition, the set gypsum-composition preferably is re-dried after<br>
application of the treatment (e.g.. with the set gypsum-containing<br>
composition optionally re-exposed to water, such as, for example, by<br>
way of soaking). Desirably, the enhancing material will migrate to the<br>
set gypsum composition, even through conventional paper sheets<br>
used in the processing of set gypsum.<br><br>
it is noteworthy that, pursuant to the invention, the enhancing<br>
material can be added to the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture prior<br>
to the formation of some of the set gypsum and, at the same time,<br>
also as a treatment after the formation of portions of set gypsum, in<br>
this respect, a pre-set treatment and post-set treatment can occur at<br>
the same time according to the invention. For example, addition of<br>
the enhancing material during setting (e.g., while only some of the set<br>
gypsum has formed) would be a pre-set treatment with respect to<br>
portions where the set gypsum has yet to form and would be a post-<br>
set treatment with respect to portions where the set gypsum has<br>
formed.<br>
It should be appreciated that combinations of the various<br>
approaches to introducing the enhancing material into the final set<br>
gypsum product, e.g., combinations of pre-set (e.g., milling with an<br>
accelerator and/or dry addition) and/or post-set treatments (in various<br>
combinations of one or more enhancing materials) to provide the<br>
various advantages described herein are intended to be included<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The enhancing material can be included in any suitable<br>
amount By way of example, the amount of enhancing material<br>
preferably is selected to obtain the advantages of the present<br>
invention, e.g., an amount sufficient to Impart a desired sag resistance<br>
anoVor dimensional stabilty to the set gypsum composition. In this<br>
respect, the effective amount of enhancing material will vary, for<br>
example, depending upon the amount of impurities, e.g., chloride<br>
anions or the like, in the calcined gypsum raw material, as wed as the<br>
type of erthancing material selected and other factors. For example,<br>
in a pre-set treatment, the amount of enhancing material included in,<br>
or added to. the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture preferably is from<br>
about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of the calcined gypsum, and more<br><br>
preferably, the amount of enhancing material included in, or added to,<br>
the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture is from about 0.1 % to about 2%<br>
by weight of the calcined gypsum. In a post-eat treatment, the<br>
amount of enhancing material utilized in the practice of the invention<br>
preferably is from about 0.01 % to about 5% by weight of the gypsum,<br>
and more preferably, from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight of the<br>
gypsum.<br>
The enhancing material can be delivered in a pre-set or post-<br>
set treatment by, for example, a solution (e.g., aqueous) comprising<br>
the enhancing material and/or as a dry additive. In the case of<br>
delivery of enhancing material via a solution, the concentration of the<br>
enhancing material in the solution is chosen so as to provide the<br>
proper amount of enhancing material based upon the weight of<br>
calcined gypsum or set gypsum being treated as indicated above.<br>
With respect to a poet-set treatment, the treating solution preferably<br>
also has sufficient water to thoroughly wet the set gypsum (e.g., to<br>
uniformly distribute the enhancing material throughout the gypsum<br>
matrix).<br>
Referring now to the enhancing materials, the organic<br>
phosphorite compounds (e.g., organic phoaphonates or phosphonic<br>
acids) of the invention include at least one RPOyM2 functional group,<br>
where M is a cation, phosphorus, or hydrogen, and R is an organic<br>
group. The use of an organic poiyphosphortic compound is preferred<br>
for both pre-set and post-set treatments, although an organic<br>
monophosphonic compound can be utilized in post-set treatments<br>
according to the invention. The preferred organic potyphosphonic<br>
compounds include at least two phosphonate salt or ion groups, at<br>
least two phosphonic aokl groups, or at least one phosphonate salt or<br>
ion group and at least one phosphonic acid group. A<br>
monophosphonic compound useful in a post-set treatment according<br><br>
to the invention includes one phoephonete salt or Ion group or at least<br>
one phosphorite acid group.<br>
Inclusion of organic phosphonic compounds as an enhancing<br>
material is beneficial because such compounds have been found to<br>
impart sag resistance to the set gypsum-containing compositions<br>
according to the invention, such as, for example, under humidified<br>
conditions. In addition, the inclusion of the organic phosphonic<br>
compounds also enhances dimensional stability because it Is<br>
believed, for example, that the organic phosphonic compounds aid in<br>
the binding of crystals in the set gypsum matrix.<br>
Notably, the organic group of the organic phosphonic<br>
compounds is bonded directly to the phosphorus (i.e., without an<br>
oxygen in between). By way of example, the organic phosphonic<br>
compounds suitable for use in the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, compounds characterized by the following structures:<br><br><br>
In these structures, R refers to an organic moiety containing at least<br>
one carbon atom bonded directly to a P atom, and n is a number of<br>
from about 1 to about 1,000, preferably a number of from about 2 to<br>
about 50.<br>
Organic phosphoric compounds include, for example, amtnotri<br>
(methytene-phosphonic acid), aminotri (methytene-phosphonte add)<br>
pentasodium salt, 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonlc add, 1-<br>
hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid tetrasodium salt,<br>
diethylenetriamine penta(methyiene phosphonic acid) pentasodium<br>
salt, diethylenetriamine penta(methytene phosphonic add) trisodium<br>
salt, hexamethytene diamine tetra(methyiene phosphonic add),<br>
hexamethyiene diamine tetra(methytene phosphonic acid) potassium<br>
salt, or the like. In some embodiments, DEQUEST® phosphorates<br>
(e.g., DEQUEST®2000, DEQUEST® 2006. DEQUEST® 2016.<br>
DEQUEST® 2054, DEQUESTO 2060S, DEQUESTO 2066A, and the<br>
like), commercially available from Solutia, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri, are<br>
utilized in the invention. Other examples of suitable organic<br>
phosphonic compounds are found, for example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.788,857.<br>
If included in the aqueous calcined gypeum mixture in a pre-set<br>
treatment, the amount of organic phosphonic compound utilized In the<br>
practice of the invention to prepare the mixture preferably is from<br>
about 0.01% to about 1% by weight of the calcined gypsum, and more<br>
preferably, from about 0.05% to about 0.2% by weight of the calcined<br>
gypsum. In a post-set treatment, the amount of organic phosphonic<br>
compound utilized in the practice of the invention and that is delivered<br>
to the set gypsum composition preferably is from about 0.01% to<br>
about 1% by weight of the gypsum, and more preferably, from about<br>
0.05% to about 0.2% by weight of the gypsum. For example, the<br><br>
organic phosphorite compound can be delivered to the set gypsum<br>
composition by a solution (e.g., aqueous) comprising the organic<br>
phosphorite compound.<br>
Carfooxylic compounds also are suitable for use as an<br>
enhancing material in the present invention. Preferably, the<br>
carboxyiic compounds are soluble in water. The use of a<br>
polycarboxylic compound is preferred, although a monocarboxylic<br>
compound can be utilized in post-set treatments according to the<br>
invention. In this respect, a polycarboxylic compound includes at<br>
least two carboxytate salt or ion groups, at least two carboxyic add<br>
groups, or at least one carboxylate salt or ion group and at toast one<br>
carboxyiic acid group. A monocarboxylic compound useful in a poet-<br>
set treatment according to the invention includes one carboxylate salt<br>
or ion group, or at least one carboxylic acid group.<br>
Inclusion of carboxyiic compounds as an enhancing material is<br>
beneficial because the carboxyiic compounds have been found to<br>
impart sag resistance to the set gypsum-containing compositions<br>
according to the invention, such as, for example, under humidfied<br>
conditions, in addition, the inclusion of the carboxyiic compounds<br>
also enhances dimensional stability because it is believed, for<br>
example, that the carboxyl groups aid in the binding of crystals in the<br>
set gypsum matrix. By way of example, and not in limitation of the<br>
invention, the polycarboxylic compound can be in the form of a<br>
polyacrylate, a poiymethacrylate, a polyethacrytate, and the like. In a<br>
post-set treatment, the carboxyiic compound additionally can be in the<br>
form of a citrate (e.g., salts, such as, for example, sodium citrate).<br>
In a pre-set treatment, the polycarboxylic compounds suitable<br>
for use in the present invention preferably have a molecular weight of<br>
from about 100,000 dattons to about 1 million daltons. Potycarboxyiic<br>
compounds of higher molecular weight are less desirable because the<br><br>
viscosity is too high, whle those of lower molecular weight<br>
(progressively decreasing below 100,000 daitons) are teats effective.<br>
In some embodiments of a pre-set treatment, the polyca tooxytic<br>
compound has a molecular weight of from about 200,000 daitons to<br>
about 700,000 daiatons, such as, for example, a molecular weight of<br>
from about 400,000 daitons to about 600,000 daitons. In some<br>
embodiments, the carboxylic compound is a polyacrylate, in which<br>
case the potyacrylate preferably has a molecular weight of from about<br>
200,000 daitons to about 700,000 daitons, more preferably about<br>
400,000 daitons to about 600,000 daitons.<br>
In a poet-set treatment, the carboxylic compound preferably<br>
has a molecular weight of from about 200 daitons to about 1,000,000<br>
daitons. For example, in some embodiments of a post-set treatment,<br>
the carboxylic compound ha6 a molecular weight of from about 200<br>
daitons to about 100,000 daitons (e.g.. from about 1 ,000 daitons to<br>
about 100,000 or from about 10,000 daitons to about 100,000<br>
daitons}, whJe in other embodiments, the carboxyiic compound has a<br>
molecular weight of from about 100,000 daitons to about 1 million<br>
daitons (e.g., from about 200,000 daitons to about 700.000 or from<br>
about 400,000 daitons to about 600,000 daitons).<br>
If included in the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture in a pre-set<br>
treatment, the amount of carboxyiic compound utilized ih the practice<br>
of the invention to prepare the mixture preferably is from about 0.01%<br>
to about 5% by weight of the calcined gypsum, and moife preferably,<br>
from about 0.05% to about 2% by weight of the calcined gypsum, in a<br>
post-set treatment, the amount of carboxyiic oompoundj utBteed in the<br>
practice of the invention and that is delivered to the set gypsum<br>
composition preferably is from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of<br>
the gypsum, and more preferably, from about 0.05% to about 2% by<br>
weight of the gypsum. For example, the carboxylic compound can be<br><br>
delivered to the set gypsum composition by a solution (e.g.. aqueous)<br>
comprising the carboxyiic compound.<br>
Borates, and In particular, naturally occurring ulexite<br>
(NaCaB5O9●8H2O) and coiemanite (Ca2B6O11 • 5H2O), or mixtures of<br>
ulexite and colemanlte, also can be included as the enhancing<br>
material. In some embodiments, ulexite is preferred, in part, due to its<br>
relatively low cost. Notably, the borates are not fully soluble in water.<br>
Surprisingly, even such semi-soluble borates, which are polyboron<br>
compounds, produce the desired degree of effects in accordance with<br>
the present invention. This is even more surprising because other<br>
fully soluble boron-containing materials such as boric acid, which is a<br>
monoboron compound, produce much less of the desired effects and<br>
are not suitable for use within the scope of the invention. Inclusion of<br>
these borates as enhancing materials is beneficial because it has<br>
been found that they impart sag resistance to set gypsum-containing<br>
materials, even in the presence of impurities, e.g., chlorides, in the<br>
aqueous calcined gypsum mixture. This discovery is significant, as it<br>
permits lower, and leas expensive, grades of calcined gypum to be<br>
used in the production of set gypsum products, such as wall board,<br>
without any significant negative effect on sag resistance. Further, the<br>
borates do not significantly retard the formation of the set gypsum-<br>
containing composition.<br>
In the pre-eet treatment method, borate can be added to the<br>
aqueous calcined gypsum mixture as a powder and/or ajs a solution<br>
(e.g., an aqueous solution). In some embodiments, for example, the<br>
borate can be added after it is milled with calcium sulfate dihydrate<br>
accelerator, as previously described. Also, in some embodirnents, the<br>
borate is added using both techniques.<br>
If included in the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture in a pre-set<br>
treatment, the amount of borate added to the mixture in the practice<br><br>
of the invention preferably is from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight<br>
of the calcined gypeum, and more preferably, from about 0.2% to<br>
about 0.5% by weight of the calcined gypsum. In a post-set<br>
treatment, the amount of borate used to treat the set gypsum in the<br>
practice of the invention preferably is from about 0.1 % to about 2% by<br>
weight of the gypeum and more preferably, from about 0.2% to about<br>
0.5% by weight of the gypsum. For example, the borate can be<br>
delivered to the set gypsum composition by a solution (e.g., aqueous)<br>
comprising the borate.<br>
In addition, and in keeping with the invention, inorganic<br>
phosphates can be combined with the other enhancing materials<br>
described herein. In particular.inorganic poryphosphatej compounds<br>
are preferred, although an inorganic monophosphate compound can<br>
be uttized in post-set treatments according to the invention. In this<br>
respect, the inorganic poJyphosphates are aelected from, for example,<br>
condensed phosphoric acids, each of which comprises two or more<br>
phosphoric add units, salts or ions of condensed phosphates, each of<br>
which comprises two or more phosphate units, or compounds<br>
including one or more phosphoric acid units and one or more<br>
phosphate salt or ton units. A monophoephete oompound useful in a<br>
post-eet treatment according to the-invention includes one phosphoric<br>
acid unit or one phosphate salt or ton unit.<br>
The inclusion of such inorganic phosphates further enhances<br>
sag resistance and, with respect to post-set treatments, pther<br>
mechanical strength (e.g., compressive strength) of the set gypsum-<br>
containing composition, in some embodiments, the inorganic<br>
phosphates are in the form of the following salts or the anionic<br>
portions thereof: a trimetaphoephate compound (e.g., salts such as,<br>
for example, sodium trimetaphosphate, calcium trfmetaphosphate,<br>
sodium calcium trirnetaphosphats, potassium trtmetaphojsphate,<br><br>
lithium trimetaphosphate, or the like), sodium hexametaphosphate<br>
having 6-27 repeating phosphate units, ammonium potyphosphate<br>
having 500-3000 (preferably, 1000-3000) repeating phosphate units,<br>
tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, trisodium dipotassium<br>
tripoiyphosphafte, sodium tripotyphosphate, tetrasodium<br>
pyrophosphate, sodium add pyrophosphate, or poiyphosphoric acid<br>
having 2 or more repeating phosphoric acid units, in some<br>
embodiments, the inorganic phosphate compound includes sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate and/or ammonium polyphosphate. Examples of<br>
monophosphate compounds (also referred to as orthophosphate<br>
compounds) useful in post-set treatment embodiments are<br>
monosodium dihydrogen phosphate, monopotassium dihydrogen<br>
phosphate, and phosphoric add.<br>
If included in the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture in a pre-set<br>
treatment, the amount of such inorganic phosphates utilized in the<br>
practice of the invention or added to the mixture preferably is from<br>
about 0.004% to about 2% by weight of the calcined gypsum, and<br>
more preferably, from about 0.04% to about 0.16% by weight of the<br>
calcined gypsum. In a post-set treatment, the amount of such<br>
inorganic phosphates utilized in the practice of the invention<br>
preferably is from about 0.004% to about 2% by weight of the<br>
gypsum, and more preferably, from about 0.04% to about 0.16% by<br>
weight of the gypsum. For example, the inorganic phosphate can be<br>
delivered to the set gypsum composition by solution (e.g., aqueous)<br>
comprising the phosphate.<br>
In addition, to the extent that any of the enhancing materials<br>
retard the hydration rate of formation of set gypsum (and adversely<br>
affect the strength of the set gypsum-containing composition), such<br>
as, for example, with respect to organic phosphontc compounds,<br>
carboxyiic compounds, or phosphates (other than ammonium<br><br>
polyphosphate or a trimetaphosphate compound) any such<br>
retardation can be ameliorated or even overcome by including in the<br>
mixture an accelerator, particularly calcium sulfate dihydrate. Of<br>
course, other accelerators commonly known in the art such as,<br>
aluminum surfate, sodium bisuifate, zinc sulfate, and the like can also<br>
be included.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the set gypsum-<br>
containing composition of the invention can be in the form of a<br>
gypsum board which preferably has a sag resistance, as determined<br>
according to ASTM C473-95, of less than about 0.1 inch (≈ 0.254 cm)<br>
per two ft. (≈ 0.61 m) length of said board. In addition, the gypsum<br>
board preferably exhibits a shrinkage during the preparation thereof<br>
(e.g., when the set gypsum-containing compound is dried) of less than<br>
about 0.02 inch (≈ 0.051 cm) per four foot (≈ 1.22 m) width and less<br>
than about 0.05 inch (≈ 0.127 cm) per twelve foot (≈ 3.66 m) length.<br>
The gypsum composition can also include optional additives,<br>
such as, but not limited to, a reinforcing additive, a binder (e.g.,<br>
polymers such as latex), expanded periite, air voids formed by an<br>
aqueous foam, a starch such as a pregeiatinized starch, acceferatar<br>
agents, retarding agents, water resistance agents, bacteriddes,<br>
fungicides, biocides, a fibrous mat (e.g., on a gypsum board<br>
comprising the inventive gypsum composition), as weU as other<br>
additives as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The reinforcing additive can be included In the inventive<br>
gypsum composition, if desired, in order to enhance strengtii during<br>
processing. For example, the reinforcing additive can include<br>
cellulosic fibers (e.g., paper fibers), mineral fliers, other synthetic<br>
fibers, or the like, or combinations thereof. The reinforcing additive,<br>
such as paper fibers, can be provided in any suitable amount For<br><br>
example, in some embodiments, the reinforcing additive is present in<br>
an amount of from about 0.1 % to about 5% percent by weight of the<br>
set gypsum composition.<br>
To facilitate a decrease in density, the set gypsum composition<br>
of the invention optiomally can include air voids formed by aqueous<br>
foam. In particular, a foaming agent can be added to the aqueous<br>
calcined gypsum mixture during preparation. It is desirable for a<br>
major part of the foaming agent to generate foam that is relatively<br>
unstable when in contact with the aqueous calcined gypsum slurry.<br>
Also, a minor part of the foaming agent desirably generates relatively<br>
stable foam. By way of example, in some embodiments, the aqueous<br>
foam is formed from at least one foaming agent having the formula<br>
CH3(CH2)XCH2(OCH2CH2)YOSO3' M+<br>
Particularly, M is a cation, X is an integer of from 2 to about 20, Y is<br>
an integer of from 0 to about 10 and is 0 in at least about 50 weight<br>
percent of the at least one foaming agent. Preferably, Y is 0 in from<br>
about 86 to about 99 weight percent of the at least one foaming<br>
agent<br>
in addition, the gypsum composition optionally can include a<br>
starch, such as a progelatinized starch or an acid-modified starch.<br>
The inclusion of the pregelatinizeisd starch<br>
of paper delamination under conditions of increased moisture. One of<br>
ordinary sklU in the art wifl appreciate methods of pregelatinfeing raw<br>
starch, such as, for example, cooking raw starch in water at<br>
temperatures of at least 185 °F (≈ 85 °C) or other methods. Suitable<br>
examples of pregetetinized starch include, but are not limited to,<br>
PCF1000 starch, commercially available from Lauhoff Grain Company<br>
and AMERIKOR 818 and HQM PREGEL starches, both commercially<br>
available from Archer Daniels Midland Company. If included, the<br>
pregeiatinized starch can be present in any suitable amount. For<br><br>
example, if included, the pregetetinlzed starch can be present In an<br>
amount of from about 0.1% to about 5% percent by weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
The gypsum composition can also include a fibrous mat The<br>
fibrous mat can be woven or nonwoven. Desirably, the fibrous mat is<br>
composed of a material that can accommodate the expansion of the<br>
gypsum composition during hydration. By way of example, the fibrous<br>
mat can be in the form of a paper mat, a fiberglass mat, or other<br>
synthetic fiber mat. in some embodiments, the fibrous mat is<br>
nonwoven and can include fiberglass. Desirably, the fibrous mat can<br>
be applied to the surface and/or be incorporated within the gypsum<br>
cast during formation in order to improve the integrity and handling<br>
abfiity of the dried gypsum cast during production, handling, and field<br>
application. In addition, the fibrous mat can be utilized as the<br>
exposed surface in a final product (e.g., a ceiling tile). and, as such,<br>
provides an aesthetically pleasing monolithic appearance that can be<br>
desirably smooth. If provided, the fibrous mat can have any suitable<br>
thickness. For example, in some embodiments, the fibrous mat has a<br>
thickness of from about 0.003 inches (≈ 0.00762 cm) to about 0.15<br>
inches (≈ 0.381 cm).<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Resistance To Permanent Deformation<br>
(Laboratory Gypsum Board Sag Resistance)<br>
Samples of gypsum-containing boards were prepared in a<br>
laboratory in accordance with the invention and compared, in regard to<br>
resistance to permanent deformation, with sample boards prepared<br>
using methods and compositions outside the scope of the invention.<br>
Samples were prepared by mixing in a 5 liter WARING blender<br>
for 10 seconds at low speed: 1.5 kg of beta calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate; 2 g of a set accelerator comprising fine ground particles of<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate coated with sugar to maintain efficiency and<br>
heated as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,573,947, the disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference; 2 liters of tap water; and 0 g<br>
additive (control samples), 1.5 g of an organic potyphosphonic<br>
compound, or 1.5 g of other additives. The slurries thus formed were<br>
cast into trays to prepare flat gypsum board samples, each having<br>
dimensions of about 6 x 24 x 1/2 inches. After the calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate set to form gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate), the boards<br>
ware dried in a 112oF (-44.4 °C) oven until their weight stopped<br>
changing. The final measured weight of each board was recorded. No<br>
paper facing was applied to these boards, in order to avoid the effect of<br>
paper covers on the gypsum boards' sag performance under humidified<br>
conditions.<br>
Each dried board was then laid in a horizontal position upon two<br>
1/2-inch-wide supports whose length extended the full width of the board,<br>
with one support at each end of the board. The boards remained in the<br>
position for a specified period of time (in this example, 4 days) under<br>
continuous surrounding conditions of 90 °F (≈ 32.2 °C) temperature and<br>
90 percent relative humidity. The extent of sag of the board was then<br><br>
determined by measuring the distance (in inches) of the center of the<br>
top surface of the board from the imaginary horizontal plane extending<br>
between the top edges of the ends of the board. The resistance to<br>
permanent deformation of the set gypsum matrix of the board is<br>
considered to be inversely proportional to the extent of the sag of the<br>
board. Thus, the greater the extent of the sag is, the lower is the<br>
relative resistance to permanent deformation of the set gypsum matrix<br>
comprising the board.<br>
The tests of resistance to permanent deformation are reported in<br>
Table i, including the composition and concentration (weight percent<br>
based on the weight of calcium sulfate herntiydrate) of the additive, the<br>
final weight of the board, and the extent of measured sag.<br>
In these laboratory experiments, sag deflection was determined<br>
according to the ASTM C473-95 Humidified Deflection Test, except<br>
that the gypsum boards tested did not include waHboard paper, and<br>
except that the boards tested were 0.5 ft. (≈ 0.154 m) x 2 ft. (≈ 0.61<br>
m), instead of 1 ft (≈ 0.305 m) by 2 ft. (-0.61 m). However, it has<br>
been found that the sag deflection of the laboratory prepared boards<br>
correlates to the sag deflection of 1 ft. (≈ 0.305 m) by 2 ft. (≈ 0.61 m)<br>
boards described In the ASTM C 473-95 test and, If there is any<br>
difference, the difference will be that the sag deflection is greater in<br>
the laboratory prepared boards. As such, if the laboratory prepared<br>
boards according to the invention meet desired sag resistance<br>
standards, boards according to the invention prepared pursuant to<br>
ASTM C 473-95 also will meet desired sag resistance standards.<br><br><br>
The data in Table I illustrates that board prepared using organic<br>
poiyphosphonic compounds in accordance with the invention was much<br>
more resistant to sag (and thus much more resistant to permanent<br>
deformation) than the control board. Moreover, board prepared with<br>
several of the organic poiyphosphonic compounds had a sag that was<br>
much less than 0.1 inch (≈ 0.254 cm) of sag per two foot (≈ 0.61 m)<br>
length of board, and thus rot perceptible to the human eye. Other<br>
organic poiyphosphonic compounds, such as OPPC 3 and OPPC 5,<br>
showed a marked improvement in sag when compared to the control.<br>
It will be appreciated that accelerators can be used to some<br>
degree to overcome retardation and strength reduction effects that may<br>
be caused by the organic poiyphosphonic compounds. In the examples<br>
Mustrated above, no attempt was made to overcome such effects.<br>
However, if an accelerator had been added to overcome such effects,<br>
then the boards made with any of these organic poiyphosphonic<br><br>
compounds would be expected to exhibit a sag of less than 0.1 inch (≈<br>
0.254 cm) per two ft. (≈ 0.61 m) length of board.<br>
Example 2<br>
This Example illustrates the use of ulexite as an enhancing<br>
material for the improvement of sag resistance in gypsum board.<br>
Resistance to permanent deformation using ulexite as an additive per<br>
se, and mied with a set accelerator comprising fine ground particles of<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate as described above was determined as<br>
described above in Example 1.<br>
In addition, the beneficial effect of using ulexite, in the presence<br>
of a high content of chloride salt impurities, is also illustrated. Gypsum<br>
board was prepared as described in Example 1, except that chloride ion<br>
was introduced into the mixture along with the ulexite additive. The sag<br>
deflection was tested in accordance with the ASTM C 473-95<br>
procedure on laboratory prepared boards as described above.<br>
In these Examples, the amount of ulexite added to the aqueous<br>
calcined gypsum slurry by addition in milled mixture with accelerator<br>
material is approximately 0.05 wt.% of the calcined gypsum. In the<br>
last Example in Table II, the total ulexite added to the aqueous<br>
calcined gypsum slurry is approximately 0.15 wt.% of the calcined<br>
gypsum (0.05 wt% in the form of milled mixture with accelerator<br>
material plus 0.10 wt.% additionally added).<br><br><br><br>
The data in Table I) illustrates the enhancement in sag<br>
resistance (provided In terms of sag deflection) obtained when using<br>
ulexlte, either by the addition of ulexite as a milled mixture of utexite<br>
and calcium sutfate dihydrate as the accelerator or as an independent<br>
additive, either a dry powder or aqueous solution. The data also<br>
shows that the borate, ulexito, provides sag deflection enhancement<br>
even when a significant amount of chloride anion impurities (e.g.,<br>
NaCI) is present in the aqueous calcined gypsum mixture (which may<br>
be present in relatively low quality calcined gypsum), and when the<br>
water absorption in the finished gypsum board product is relatively<br>
high.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Post-Set Treatment of Calcium Sulfata Dihydrate<br>
In some alternative preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, calcium sulfate dihydrate cast is treated with an aqueous<br>
solution of an enhancing material to increase resistance to permanent<br>
deformation (e.g., sag resistance), and dimensional stability of set<br>
gypsum-containing products after redrying. More spedficaly,<br>
treatment of calcium sulfate dihydrate cast with various enhancing<br>
materials in accordance with the present invention has been<br>
discovered to increase resistance to permanent deformation (e.g., sag<br>
resistance) and dimensional stability. Thus, the embodiment wherein<br>
the enhancing material is added to set gypsum provides new<br>
compositions and methods for making improved gypsum-containing<br>
products, Including but not limited to, boards, panels, plasters, tiles,<br>
gypsum/celluiose fiber composites, etc. Therefore, any gypsum<br>
based product which requires strict control over sag resistance wM<br>
benefit from this embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Two exemplary methods of post treatment of set gypsum are<br>
as follows.<br>

In both of the above methods, the aqueous solution of the<br>
enhancing material is preferably applied to the set gypsum.<br>
The enhancing material was sprayed onto the set gypsum<br>
composition as a solution of enhancing material in water. The amount<br>
of enhancing material in solution is based on the weight of the calcium<br>
sulfate dihydrate (set gypsum).<br>
The laboratory prepared boards were prepared as described in<br>
Example I. and the ASTM C 473-95 Humidified Sag Deflection Test<br>
was carried out in laboratory boards, also as explained above in<br>
Example I.<br><br>
Table III illustrates the improvement in sag deflection achieved<br>
when the enhancing material or additive is an organic polyphosphonic<br>
compound. Table IV illustrates the improvement of sag deflection<br>
achieved when the additive is a poly(acrylic acid). Table V illustrates<br>
the improvement of sag deflection achieved when the additive is<br>
sodium citrate, a carboxylic compound which includes at least two<br>
carboxylate groups.<br><br><br><br>
The data in Table IV illustrates that the carboxylates provide<br>
enhanced strength to the set gypsum composition in post-set<br>
treatment. The data shows that the use of soluble carboxytates, i.e.,<br>
PAA 1 -4 and PAA6 and PAA7 is more beneficial than carboxyfates<br>
that are not very soluble in water, e.g., PAA 5, although even post-<br>
treatment with PAA5 provided a board with improved sag resistance<br>

Table V illustrates the unexpected benefits of post-set<br>
Treatment Sodium citrate is ordinarily considered a retarder of set,<br>
and Its use adversely affects strength and sag resistance when it is<br>
used as a pre-treatment additive. However, as a post-set treatment, it<br>
has been found that sodium citrate increases sag resistance.<br>
