DESCRIPTION CARBOSTYRIL DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to novel carbostyril derivatives being useful as medicines in the prophylaxis or treatment of various ischemic diseases. Background Art<br>
Ischemic diseases such as thrombosis or arteriosclerosis may break out and become worse by a complicated interaction of three factors of the change in the components in the blood fluid, the abnormal blood flow and the disorder of the blood vessel wall. Although thrombosis is caused by various factors, it mainly breaks out by the disorder of the intima cells like in the case of atherosclerosis, subsequently the activation of platelets, and then by the adhesion and aggregation of platelets.<br>
Arteriosclerosis breaks out and becomes worse by the growth of the blood vessel smooth muscle cells by the complicated interaction of the above mentioned three factors, and then by the thickening of the intima.<br>
Thus, it is very important that a medicant being useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of ischemic diseases such as thrombosis or arteriosclerosis should essentially show both antithrombotic activity and intima thickening inhibitory activity.<br>
There are known various carbostyril derivatives. For example, WO 93/04042 (= JP-A-5-194405) discloses carbostyril derivatives of the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein A is a lower alkylene; R is -NR1R2, -S02NR3R4, or -Y-NR5R6; Rl is<br>
&gt;r<br>
'1,<br>
ty<br>
  ral<br>
U.S. Patent 4,070,470, 4,216,220 and 4,313,947 disclose carbostyril derivatives of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is H, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or aralkyl, R4 is OH, alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted amino, heterocyclic amino, etc., A is lower alkylene<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is H, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or phenylalkyl, R2 is H, halogen, OH or phenylalkoxy, R3 is H, OH or lower alkyl, R4 is cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, cycloalkylalkyl, etc., R5 is H, alkyl, lower alkenyl, phenyl,<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 is substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, piperidinyl-lower alkyl, etc., R2 is<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclo-lower alkyl, pyridylthio-lower alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl, etc., and A is an alkylene, which have a platelet aggregation inhibitory activity.<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 is lower alkyl, R2 is cycloalkyl or pyridyl, and A is an alkylene, which have a platelet aggregation inhibitory activity.<br>
There are many other literatures which disclose carbostyril derivatives analogous to the compounds of the present invention.<br>
However, those carbostyril derivatives of those known literatures as mentioned above are distinguished from the compounds of the present invention in that those known compounds other than those of the above first literature WO 93/04042 have no ureido-lower alkoxy substituent on the carbostyril nucleus.<br><br>
wherein A is a lower alkylene group,<br>
R is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a lower alkoxy group,<br>
R1 and R2 are the same or different and are each a lower alkyl group<br><br>
having optionally a substituent selected from a hydroxy group, a lower alkoxy group, a phenyl-lower alkoxy group and a lower alkanoyloxy group; a cycloalkyl group having optionally a substituent selected from a hydroxy group, a hydroxy-substituted lower alkoxy group and a lower alkanoyloxy group; or an amino group having optionally a substituent selected from a lower alkyl group and a cycloalkyl group,<br>
R3 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group or a<br>
hydroxy-substituted lower alkyl group, and<br>
the bond between 3- and 4-positions of the carbostyril nucleus is a single bond or a double bond,<br>
provided that when R and R3 are a hydrogen atom, R1 and R2 should<br>
not be either an unsubstituted lower alkyl group or an unsubstituted cycloalkyl<br>
group,<br>
or a salt thereof.<br>
According to the studies of the present inventors, the carbostyril derivatives (1) of the present invention and a salt thereof show both potent antithrombotic activity and intima thickening inhibitory activity in vivo, and they also show a platelet aggregation inhibitory activity, a dissociation activity of platelet mass, and an increasing activity in blood flow in the brain and the<br>
peripheral vessel, etc.<br>
The present compounds show the pharmacological activities for a prolonged time, and show very weak effects on the circulation, e.g. very weak increasing activity in heart beat, very weak hypotensive activity, etc., and hence, they show very few side effects, especially on the heart. Besides, the<br><br>
present compounds are well absorbed at the digestion organs and show excellent efficiency of migration into the blood flow.<br>
Thus, the present compounds are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of thrombotic diseases or arteriosclerotic diseases. For example, the present compounds may clinically be used in the prophylaxis or treatment of various ischemic diseases, for example, in the prophylaxis or treatment of brain diseases such as cerebral atherosclerosis, cerebral infarction, transient cerebral ischemic attack (TIA), reversible ischemic neurological deficit (RIND), etc., heart diseases such as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, etc., chronic arterial embolisms such as Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), embolic atherosclerosis, intermittent claudication, etc., diabetic complications such as diabetic neuropathy, diabetic dermopathy, diabetic nephropathy, etc., in the prevention of re-stenosis after interventional treatment of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), directional coronary atherectomy (DCA), stent, etc., in the prevention of re-occlusion after the transplant of artificial organs such as artificial blood vessel or kidney, in the prevention of thrombosis or embolism during the extracorporeal circulation such as artificial kidney dialysis or operations.<br>
Besides, the present compounds also show a potent inhibitory activity against cGMP inhibited cAMP PDE (PDE 3) which is classified by phosphodiesterase nomenclature disclosed in Molecular Pharmacology, 46, pp. 399-405 (1994).<br>
The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a representative intracellular second messenger in the living body, and decomposed and<br><br>
inactivated by phosphodiesterase (hereinafter, abbreviated as "PDE"). Currently, at least 7 different PDE isozyme gene families are recognized and these PDEs are widely distributed in many cell types and tissues.   Thus, a PDE inhibitor increases the concentration of cAMP in tissue cells, and hence, is useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of various diseases caused by the decrease in cAMP level which is induced by the abnormal metabolism of cAMP.<br>
As is disclosed in Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 51, pp. 13-33 (1991), Trends in Pharmacological Science, 11, pp. 150-155 (1990), Trends in Pharmacological Science, 12, pp. 19-27 (1991), the present compounds having a PDE inhibitory activity can also be clinically used in the prophylaxis or treatment of obesity based on the lipocatabolic action in fatty cells, or in the treatment of allergic diseases and asthma based on the inhibitory activity of the release of the chemical mediator from inflammatory cells in addition to the clinical use based on the above mentioned antithrombotic activity and the intima thickening inhibitory activity.<br>

To a mixture of dimethylformamide (45 ml) and water (5 ml) are added 6-(3-phenoxycarbonylaminopropoxy)carbostyril (5.0 g) and (R,R)-(-)-N-(trans-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-N-cyclopropylamine (2.4 g), and the mixture is heated with stirring at 85°C for 6 hours. To the mixture is added water (80 ml) at 80°C, and the mixture is allowed to cool while the mixture is stirred overnight. The precipitated crystals are collected by filtration, washed with water, and purified by silica gel column chromatography (solvent; methylene chloride:methanol: ethyl acetate = 5:1:5), and recrystallized from ethanol to give (R,R)-(-)-6-{3-[3-(trans-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-3-cyclopropylureido]propoxy}carbostyril (2.9 g)<br><br>
The corresponding starting compounds are treated in the same manner as in Example 34 to give the compounds of Examples 6-8 and 10-31. Pharmacological Experiment 1      Platelet aggregation inhibitory activity (1)      Preparation of platelet rich plasma (PRP):<br>
The blood was collected from the carotid of a male rabbit without anesthesia (NZW species, body weight; 2-3 kg) with mixing thereof with 1/10 volume of citric acid. The blood thus obtained was separated and put into plastic test tubes (each about 7 ml), and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature to give a turbid supernatant as a platelet rich plasma (PRP).<br><br>
The residue from which PRP is separated was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected as a platelet poor plasma (PPP). The PRP was diluted with PPP so that the concentration thereof was adjusted to 5 x<br>
105 cells/jil, and used in the platelet aggregation inhibitory activity test.<br>
(2)      Method for platelet aggregation inhibitory activity test:<br>
The platelet aggregation was tested according to Born's turbidimetry. That is, a test compound was dissolved in dimethylformamide, and the test compound solution (1 (il) thus obtained was put into a cuvette, and thereto was further added PRP (200 (il). Immediately thereafter, the cuvette was set into an apparatus for determining platelet aggregation activity, PAM-8T (manufactured by Mevanix Inc.), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C. Precisely three minutes thereafter, a solution of adenosine diphosphate (ADP, PA test ADP [MCM], purchased by MC Medical Ltd.) in physiological saline solution or a collagen solution (Collagenreagent Horm, purchased by MC Medical Ltd.) (20 (il) was added thereto. The final concentration of the ADP solution or the collagen solution was 7.5 (iM or 20 (ig/ml, respectively.<br>
The maximum aggregation rate and the aggregation inhibitory rate were calculated by the following equations.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmacological Experiment 2     Antithrombotic activity<br>
Antithrombotic activity of the test compounds was estimated by an inhibitory activity of the test compound by oral administration against death induced by pulmonary infarction in mice which was introduced by intravenous administration of collagen (pulmonary infarction inhibitory activity).<br>
Male ICR mice (5-week old, body weight; about 25 g) was fasted overnight, and separated into groups (15 mice per each group) and numbered. A test compound solution, which was prepared by suspending a test compound in 1 % hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 2910 TC-5 (HPMC, manufactured by Shin-etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), was orally administered to the mice, and 10 minutes thereafter, a collagen solution (the method for preparation thereof and a dose thereof are explained hereafter) was injected to the mice at the tail vein at the constant rate. The lethality of the mice was determined by the number of mice which were died in an hour after the administration of collagen solution. The antithrombotic activity of the test compound was estimated by the inhibitory rate (%) of the lethality of the mice. The collagen solution was prepared by dissolving collagen (Type III, manufactured by Sigma Chemical Ltd.) in 0.05 M acetic acid solution containing 2 mM calcium chloride and 5 % glucose at 4°C so that the final concentration of collagen was adjusted to 2.5 mg/ml, and then the pH value thereof was adjusted to pH 7.4 with sodium hydroxide the day before the experiment. The collagen solution was incubated with stirring at 37°C for two hours, and then further stirred at room temperature overnight. Just before the experiment, the pH value of the collagen solution was adjusted again to pH 7.4. The amount of the collagen solution which was<br><br>
injected at the tail vein was previously determined so that the lethality by pulmonary infarction induced thereby became about 75 %. The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Pharmacological Experiment 3     Intima thickening inhibitory activity<br>
Male SD rats (6-week old) were separated into groups (8 rats per each group) and numbered. A test compound solution, which was prepared by suspending a test compound in 1 % hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 2910 TC-5 (HPMC, manufactured by Shin-etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.) was orally administered to the rats. In the control group, 1 % HPMC solution was orally administered instead of the test compound solution.  One or two hours thereafter, two french balloon catheters (manufactured by Baxter Travenol Inc.) were inserted into the left common carotid artery of the rats, and the artery was injured by abrading five times with a balloon. The day of balloon abrasion was considered as Day 0. On the following day (Day 1), a test compound was orally administered to the rats two times a day (in the morning and in the evening). On Day 2, 1.48<br>
MBq/ml of 3H-thymidine (dose: 5 ml/kg, manufactured by NEN Research<br>
Products, Ltd.) was injected at the tail vein of the rats about one hour after the administration of the test compound so that the time after the balloon injury was<br>
fixed to the same in each rat. Precisely 45 minutes after the injection of 3H-<br>
thymidine at the tail veil, the common carotid artery of the rats was taken out. In the test compound-treated group, only the left common carotid artery which was injured by balloon was taken out, and in the control group, both the left and right common carotid arteries were taken out. The common carotid artery thus obtained was cut to pieces of exact 1 cm long, and the unnecessary portions such as the outer membrane or the nerves were completely removed. The common carotid artery was put into a glass vial, and thereto was added a 0.5 N sodium hydroxide (0.5 ml), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C<br><br><br><br><br><br>
GMP inhibited PDE (hcGIP2, reference; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 3721, (1992),GenBankM91667).<br>
The PDE activity was tested in a reaction mixture (200 jll) of 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.4 |iM [8-<br>
3H]cAMP, a PDE enzyme and a test compound. The reaction mixture was<br>
incubated at 30°C for 15 minutes to make the PDE enzyme work, and then the reaction was quenched by incubating at 100°C for 6 minutes in order to inactivate the PDE enzyme. The reaction mixture was cooled, and added thereto snake venom so that the final concentration thereof was 0.1 mg/ml. The<br>
mixture was incubated at 30°C for 10 minutes to generate [8-3H] adenosine.<br>
The [8-3H] adenosine thus obtained was isolated and collected by cation ion<br>
exchange column and the radioactivity thereof was determined by liquid scintillation counter.<br>
The test compounds were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and the test compound solution thus obtained was added to the reaction mixture so that the final concentration thereof in the reaction mixture was controlled to 0.5 %. Each assay was done in duplicate. The PDE activity (Vs) in the reaction mixture at each concentration of the test compound was estimated from the test results, and the PDE activity inhibitory activity (%) of the test compound was calculated according to the following equation based on the PDE activity (Vc) in the control group wherein DMF was used instead of the test compound solution.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
