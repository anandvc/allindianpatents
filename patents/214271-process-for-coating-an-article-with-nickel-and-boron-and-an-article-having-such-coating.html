				<td>The present invention relates to a process for coating an article<br>
with nickel and boron and an article having such a coating and more<br>
particularly to electroless nickel plating.<br>
The document US 6,066,406 discloses corrosion and wear resistant<br>
metallic coatings containing nickel and boron. The coatings as described<br>
according to said prior art reference are preferably deposited on<br>
catalytically active substrates from an electroless coating bath containing<br>
nickel ions, a stabilizer, a metal ion complexing agent, and a borohydride<br>
reducing agent, at a pH of about 10 to about 14. However, the hardness of<br>
said coating layers is still limited as well as the other properties being<br>
important for technical applications, which limitations result from the<br>
insuppressible occurrence of substantive co-depositing of impurities<br>
during the plating process. Especially, the coating baths according to the<br>
state of the art tend to spontaneous decomposition caused by the presence<br>
of unwanted elements that themselves would become activated plating<br>
sites that, once plating become larger in mass until they become so large<br>
that they fall out of solution, thereby dropping to the bottom of the plating<br>
tank causing said tank to plate or worse, additionally falling onto the<br>
work item to be plated, resulting thereby in a rough coating surface.<br>
Furthermore, in most cases the coating baths according to the state of the<br>
art additionally do not provide a proper reduction of the present nickel<br>
ions, leading to a bath solution that requires discarding, thereby also<br>
contributing to a worse quality of the coating surface.<br>
Therefore, there remains a strong demand for a process for<br>
depositing a metal coating containing nickel and boron on a substrate,<br>
which avoids completely such phenomenon being caused by undesired<br>
co-depositing of impurity particles, affecting unfavourably the application<br>
properties of the resulting nickel containing coatings as produced according to<br>
the state of the art.<br>
This problem is solved by the process of the present invention as<br>
described further in the specification making use of the plating bath having the<br>
specific parameters as described.<br>
Especially, the process according to the present invention is<br>
characterized by the use of most accurately deionized water with a conductivity<br>
in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.1 ÂµS for the preparation of the plating bath,<br>
which measure in particular avoids completely the undesired co-deposition of<br>
impurity particles in the coatings, resulting surprisingly in coatings with<br>
exceptionally unexpected physical properties in regard of particular hardness,<br>
corrosion resistance, wear resistance, abrasion resistance, etc. (see below under<br>
section "K" of the working example).<br>
In particular, the use of said deionized water prevents spontaneous<br>
decomposition of the coating bath by removing unwanted elements that<br>
themselves would become larger in mass until they become so large in mass<br>
that they fall out of the solution dropping to the bottom of the plating tank,<br>
thereby causing the tank to plate or worse, additionally falling onto the work<br>
item to be coated, thereby resulting in a rough coating surface. Furthermore,<br>
when using deionized water, the elements found in tap water, which usually<br>
tend to interfere with the stabilizing elements of the bath, are absent, resulting<br>
in a proper reduction of the nickel. Therefore, the above-discussed<br>
decomposition of the coating bath can be avoided.<br>
The further details of the teaching according to the present invention are<br>
described by means of the following working example.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
A. BATH COMPONENTS<br>
Cemkote A = Make-up ( = premixed solution of 24g/l of total tank volume of Sodium<br>
Hydroxide pellets (Electronic Grade) mixed with high-quality deionized water.<br>
Cemkote B = Reducer ( = solution comprising an effective amount of a borohydride<br>
reducing agent and an effective amount of a metal ion complexing agent, preferably of<br>
ethylenediamine);<br>
Cemkote C = Stabilizer ( = preferably a solution comprising an effective amount of lead<br>
tungstate).<br>
Cemkote D = Nickel Replenisher ( = a solution comprising both Ni-based plating<br>
solution, ammonium hydroxide, and a metal ion complexing agent, preferably<br>
ethylenediamine according to effective amounts, respectively).<br>
B. MAKE-UP PROCEDURE<br>
a. Rinse tank thoroughly with deionized water. Tank must be free of debris<br>
and plate-out residue.<br>
b. Place new 5-micron filters in the filter chamber.<br>
c. Fill the tank half way with deionized water having a conductivity in the<br>
range of 0.05 to 0.1 ÂµS.<br>
d. Add 20% by volume of the total tank volume of Cemkote A.<br>
e. Add premixed solution of 24g/l of total tank volume of Sodium Hydroxide<br>
pellets (Electronic Grade) mixed with high-quality deionized water.<br>
Caution: this solution heats up when mixed.<br>
f. Fill tank to working level with high-quality deionized water.<br>
g. Start pump.<br>

D. PLATING<br>
After proper preparation, parts are to be placed into the Cemkote solution for the required<br>
time in order to obtain the desired thickness of plating.<br>
E. AGITATION<br>
Air agitation is not recommended for this process. Continuous filtration with 5-micron<br>
filters and the total tank turnover rate of 10 times per hour is recommended.<br>
F. TANK CLEANING<br>
A solution of 30% to 50% Nitric acid solution should be placed into the tank after every<br>
third day of plating to clean out all the plate-out, if any, as well as passivate the tank. Let<br>
circulate over night. After Nitric acid solution is removed, refill the tank with a 2% to 3%<br>
ammonium hydroxide solution to neutralize any residual nitric acid (pH to be 10.5 or<br>
higher). Let circulate for one to two hours, then drain and flush with high-quality DI<br>
water.<br>
