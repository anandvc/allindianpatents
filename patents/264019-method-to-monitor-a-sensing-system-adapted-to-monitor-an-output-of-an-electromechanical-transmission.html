				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS TO MONITOR AN OUTPUT SPEED<br>
SENSOR DURING OPERATION OF AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL<br>
TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure pertains generally to control systems for electromechanical <br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline and to wheels of the vehicle. Electric machines, operatively<br>
connected to an electrical energy storage device, comprise motor/generators<br>
operable to generate motive torque for input to the transmission,<br>
independently of torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
electric machines are further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
the electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br><br>
powertrain system, including controlling transmission gear shifting,<br>
controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power<br>
interchange between the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines.<br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear operation and continuously variable operation through<br>
actuation of torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic C1rcuit to<br>
effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear operation occurs when the ratio of the<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed of<br>
the input member is constant, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable operation occurs when the ratio of<br>
the rotational speed of the transmission output member to the rotational speed<br>
of the input member is variable based upon operating speeds of one or more<br>
electric machines. The electric machines can be selectively connected to the<br>
output member via actuation of a clutch, or directly by fixed mechanical<br>
connections. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic C1rcuit, including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management<br>
valves, pressure control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled<br>
by a control module.<br>
[0005] During operation, there is a need to monitor sensing systems used for<br>
operation, control, and fault detection of the powertrain. One sensing system<br>
comprises a vehicle speed sensing system, comprising a sensing system<br>
adapted to monitor rotational speed of an output shaft of the transmission.<br>
Fault detection in the output shaft rotational speed sensing system typically<br>
includes monitoring signal output and detecting presence of an output signal<br><br>
when one is expected, e.g., wherein the engine is running and the transmission<br>
is in gear there is an expectation of an output from the sensing system. Fault<br>
detection further includes monitoring signal output during ongoing operation<br>
and to identify an unexpected change in signal output, e.g., a drop in output by<br>
a calibrated speed (e.g., 1000 RPM) when the vehicle is operating above a<br>
speC1fied vehicle speed (e.g. 23 MPH). In ongoing operation, espeC1ally in an<br>
electro-mechanical transmission, rotational speed of the output shaft is utilized<br>
in numerous control algorithms, and an uncorrupted signal is preferred, for<br>
optimum performance. Therefore, there is a need for additional monitoring<br>
thereof. Such a system is described hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] An electro-mechanical transmission includes an output. A method to<br>
monitor a sensing system adapted to monitor the output includes monitoring<br>
rotational speed of a wheel operatively connected to a driveline operatively<br>
connected to the output of the electro-mechanical transmission. A first<br>
expected output of the transmission based upon the rotational speed of the<br>
wheel is determined. A second expected output of the transmission based<br>
upon a rotational speed of a torque-generative device operatively connected to<br>
the transmission is also determined. The first and second expected outputs<br>
and an output of the sensing system are then compared.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0010] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating embodiments of the invention only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an<br>
engine 14, transmission 10, driveline 90, control system, and hydraulic control<br>
C1rcuit (not separately illustrated) which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. Mechanical aspects of the<br>
exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,953,409, which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission<br>
embodying the concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12 having an input speed, Ni that is<br>
preferably driven by the internal combustion engine 14, and an output shaft 64<br>
having an output rotational speed, No. The rotational speed of the output shaft<br>
64 is preferably monitored using a sensing system 84, comprising a multi-<br>
tooth wheel and a sensing element. The multi-tooth wheel is preferably<br><br>
rotatably attached to the output shaft and comprises a device having a plurality<br>
of teeth and corresponding detents that are located around a C1rcumference<br>
thereof. The sensing element preferably comprises a Hall-effect sensing<br>
device mounted in a fixed location adjacent the multi-tooth wheel. The<br>
sensing element is operative to sense the teeth and corresponding detents in<br>
the multi-tooth wheel as the output shaft rotates, and generate an electrical<br>
pulse signal at each transition in the wheel between a tooth and a detent.<br>
Rotational speed is determined based upon the number of electrical pulses<br>
generated by the sensor over a predetermined elapsed period of time, which is<br>
interpretable by a control module, in this application a transmission control<br>
module ('TCM') 17. The sensing element is preferably configured to generate<br>
the electrical pulse output such that rotational direction can be interpreted<br>
therefrom. In the embodiment described, when the output shaft 64 is rotating<br>
in a direction resulting in forward propulsion of the vehicle, the electrical<br>
pulse has a duration of approximately 45 microseconds. When the output<br>
shaft 64 is rotating in a direction resulting in reverse propulsion of the vehicle,<br>
the electrical pulse has a duration of approximately 180 microseconds. Thus,<br>
the control module regularly and ongoingly monitors duration of one or more<br>
signal pulse to determine rotational direction of the output shaft 64.<br>
[0011] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft having<br>
characteristic speed NE which is operatively connected to the transmission<br>
input shaft 12. The output of the engine, comprising speed NE and output<br><br>
torque TE can differ from transmission input speed NI and engine input torque<br>
TI when a torque management device (not shown) is placed therebetween.<br>
[0012] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28,<br>
and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. An electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, is operative to control actuation and<br>
deactivation of the clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3<br>
preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices<br>
grounded to the transmission case 68. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump via an electro-<br>
hydraulic control C1rcuit.<br>
[0013] There is a first electric machine comprising a motor/generator 56,<br>
referred to as MG-A, and a second electric machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B operatively connected to the<br>
transmission via the planetary gears. Each of the machines includes a stator, a<br>
rotor, and a resolver assembly 80, 82. The stator for each machine is<br>
grounded to outer transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled<br>
electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for MG-A 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operably attached to output shaft 60 via carrier 26.<br>
The rotor for MG-B 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub 66. The resolver<br>
assemblies 80, 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72. Each resolver assembly 80, 82 comprises a known variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator, operably connected to the stator<br>
of each electric machine, and a resolver rotor, operably connected to the rotor<br><br>
of each electric machine. Each resolver 80, 82 comprises a sensing device<br>
adapted to sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the<br>
resolver rotor, and identify the rotational position. Signals output from the<br>
resolvers are interpreted to provide rotational speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72, referred to as NA and NB. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque, To to<br>
vehicle wheels. The driveline 90 comprises a transfer case 96 having a known<br>
axle ratio, which transmits torque to vehicle drive wheels. Each wheel of the<br>
vehicle, including the drive wheels and driven wheels, has a wheel speed<br>
sensing system 94 comprising one or more speed sensing devices mounted at<br>
the wheel and adapted to measure rotational speed of the respective wheel,<br>
including right-front (RF), right-rear (RR), left-front (LF), and left-rear (LR)<br>
wheels. The output of each wheel speed sensing system 94 is monitored by a<br>
brake control module ('BrCM') 33.<br>
[0014] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14, and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
referred to as TI', 'TA', and 'TB' respectively, as a result of energy<br>
conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy<br>
storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to<br>
transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer conductors<br>
27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described hereinafter<br>
with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy to and from<br>
MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits<br>
electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical<br><br>
current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether<br>
the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of<br>
power inverters and respective motor control modules configured to receive<br>
motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing<br>
motor drive or regeneration functionality. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72 are three-phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate<br>
within a stator that is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters<br>
comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module (ECM) 23,<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 17, battery pack control module (BPCM)<br>
21, and TPIM 19, and the BrCM 33. A hybrid control module (HCP) 5<br>
provides overarching control and coordination of the aforementioned control<br>
modules. There is a User Interface (UI) 13 operably connected to a plurality<br>
of devices through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs<br>
operation of the powertrain including the transmission 10, including an<br><br>
operator torque request (To_req) and operator brake request (BRAKE).<br>
Exemplary vehicle input devices to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, a transmission gear selector, and, a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
system. Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with<br>
other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (LAN)<br>
bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control<br>
parameters and commands among the various control modules. The speC1fic<br>
communication protocol utilized is application-speC1fic. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfaC1ng between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock braking, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
[0016] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21, including communicating with the BrCM. Based upon various<br>
input signals from the UI 13 and the powertrain, including the battery pack,<br>
the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: the operator torque request<br>
(TO_REQ), the engine input torque TI, clutch torque, (TCL_N) for the N various<br>
torque-transfer clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10; and motor<br>
torques TA and TB for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the electro-hydraulic control C1rcuit 42, including for monitoring<br>
various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and executing<br>
control signals for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control<br>
valves contained therein.<br><br>
[0017] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine input torque, TI, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simpliC1ty, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 (which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, NI manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0018] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (TCL_N) for each of the N clutches, i.e., C1, C2, C3,<br>
and C4, and rotational output speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other<br>
actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the<br>
TCM to the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from<br>
pressure switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift<br>
solenoids to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating<br>
modes, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0019] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br><br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, amp-hour throughput, battery temperature,<br>
battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0020] The BrCM 33 executes vehicle functions related to braking control,<br>
traction control, and vehicle acceleration management. The BrCM is signally<br>
connected to the wheel speed sensors 94 and functions to acquire data<br>
therefrom and determines absolute wheel speeds, NWHL, for each of the<br>
wheels, which it communicates to the TCM and other controllers via the LAN.<br>
[0021] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) C1rcuitry, and input/output C1rcuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer C1rcuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0022] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br><br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0023] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in one of several operating range states comprising fixed<br>
gear operation and continuously variable operation, described with reference<br>
to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0024] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the speC1fic clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. A first continuously variable<br>
operating range state, i.e., Mode I, is selected when clutch C1 70 is actuated in<br>
order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The<br>
engine 14 can be either on or off. A second continuously variable operating<br>
range state, i.e., Mode II, is selected when clutch C1 70 is released and clutch<br>
C2 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28. Again, the engine 14 can be either on or off. For<br><br>
purposes of this description, Engine Off is defined by engine input speed, NE,<br>
being equal to zero revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft<br>
is not rotating. Other factors outside the scope of this disclosure affect when<br>
the electric machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 operate as motors and<br>
generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0025] Mode I and Mode II are characterized by single clutch applications,<br>
i.e., either clutch C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of<br>
the electric machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, which can be referred to as a<br>
continuously variable transmission mode. Certain operating rage states are<br>
described below in which fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an<br>
additional clutch. This additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as<br>
shown in the table, above. When the additional clutch is applied, fixed gear<br>
operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission, i.e., NI/No, is achieved.<br>
During fixed gear operation, the rotations of machines MG-A 56 and MG-B<br>
72, i.e., NA and NB, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as<br>
defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft<br>
12. Furthermore, the rotational speeds, NAand NB, are directional in nature,<br>
such that a positive sign in the speed of either of the machines corresponds to<br>
a positive direction translating to forward movement of the vehicle and a<br>
negative sign in the speed of either of the machines corresponds to a negative<br>
direction translating to reverse movement of the vehicle.<br>
[0026] When the transmission is operated in one of the fixed-gear modes, the<br>
transmission output speed, No, can be determined based upon the input speed,<br>
NI, multiplied by the selected gear ratio for the fixed-gear mode, i.e.,<br>
[0027] No = NIx GR.<br><br>
[0028] When the transmission is operated in one of the continuously variable<br>
ratios, the output speed, No, can be determined by calculating a mathematical<br>
average of the rotational speeds of the electric machines, i.e.,<br>
[0029] NO=(NA + NB)/2.<br>
[0030] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request to be executed at shaft 64.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road<br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The transmission operating range state is<br>
determined for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an operator demand for<br>
torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br>
described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external<br>
conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load.<br>
The transmission operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a control module command to operate one of the<br>
electric machines as an electrical generator or as an electric motor. The<br>
transmission operating range state can be determined by an optimization<br>
algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum system effiC1ency based<br>
upon operator demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy<br>
effiC1enC1es of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system<br>
manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based<br>
upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
optimization occurs to optimize system effiC1enC1es to improve fuel economy<br>
and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br><br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the<br>
parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output<br>
of the transmission required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described<br>
hereinbelow. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0031] The energy storage system and electric machines MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween.<br>
Furthermore, the engine, the electric machines, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output. In Mode I operation, the<br>
transmission operates as an input-split electrically variable transmission<br>
(EVT). In Mode II operation, the transmission operates as a compound-split<br>
EVT. While operating in either of these two modes, the control system<br>
performs closed loop control on an engine speed which optimizes fuel<br>
economy while still meeting the torque request and given power constraints.<br>
It then commands motor speeds to vary the input-to-output speed ratio to<br>
accelerate the vehicle, in response to the operator torque request. Through use<br>
of the two additional clutches, the transmission also has the capability of<br>
achieving one of four fixed gear ratios. While operating in a fixed gear, the<br>
vehicle acts as a parallel hybrid and the motors are used only for boosting and<br>
braking/regeneration the vehicle.<br>
[0032] In operation, an operating mode, i.e., one of the fixed gear and<br>
continuously variable operating range states is determined for the exemplary<br>
transmission based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the<br><br>
powertrain. This includes an operator torque request, typically communicated<br>
through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described. Additionally, a demand<br>
for output torque is predicated on external conditions, including, e.g., road<br>
grade, road surface conditions, or wind load. The operating mode may be<br>
predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a control module<br>
command to operate of the electric machines in an electrical energy generating<br>
mode or in a torque generating mode. The operating mode can be determined<br>
by an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system effiC1ency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy effiC1enC1es of the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and system optimization occurs to optimize system effiC1enC1es to improve<br>
fuel economy and manage battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be<br>
determined based upon a fault in a component or system.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Fig. 3, and referenC1ng the transmission described<br>
in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1, speC1fic aspects of the transmission and control<br>
system are described herein. Fig. 3 depicts a flowchart 300, representing<br>
algorithms executed in the various control modules. The algorithms act to<br>
monitor a sensing system adapted to monitor output of the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission, depicted herein as monitoring rotational speed, No, of the output<br>
shaft 64 using sensing system 84. The algorithms are preferably executed<br>
during each 25 ms loop cycle, and preferably executed in a manner to achieve<br>
a deC1sion with regard to presence of a fault within 200 milliseconds of its<br>
occurrence.<br><br>
[0034] In operation, the signal output from the transmission output speed<br>
sensor 84 is monitored (302). Output of a first sensor is monitored (304),<br>
comprising the signal output, NWHL, from one or more of the wheel speed<br>
sensors 94, preferably the driven wheels, i.e., those operatively connected to<br>
the driveline 90 operatively connected to the output shaft 64 of the electro-<br>
mechanical transmission. Alternatively, input from only one of the driven<br>
wheels is monitored. An average wheel speed, NWHLAVG, is determined<br>
based upon the inputs from the wheel speed sensors (306). An adjusted<br>
average wheel speed, NWHL_AVG, is determined based upon the inputs from the<br>
wheel speed sensors, adjusted based upon gear reductions occurring through<br>
the transfer case 96, typically referred to as an axle ratio (308).<br>
[0035] The powertrain operation is monitored, to determine the input<br>
speed, Ni, the speeds of the electric motors NA, NB, and the transmission<br>
operating range state, i.e., one of MI, MII, FG1, FG2, FG3, FG4 (310).<br>
[0036] A first expected output of the transmission is determined based upon<br>
the output of the wheel speed sensors, and typically comprises the adjusted<br>
average wheel speed, NWHL_ADJ.<br>
[0037] A second expected output of the transmission is determined, based<br>
upon the operation of the powertrain. When the transmission is operating in<br>
one of the fixed gear modes (312), the second expected output is determined<br>
based upon the input speed from the engine and the fixed gear ratio, i.e., NIx<br>
GR, and compared to the first expected output, NWHL_ADJ (314). When the<br>
values of these expected outputs are in agreement, within allowable<br>
measurement errors, an average (AVG) of the first and second expected<br><br>
outputs is calculated and the rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64<br>
determined using sensing system 84 is compared therewith (316). Under a<br>
condition wherein the rotational speed, No, of the output shaft determined<br>
using sensing system 84 agrees with the average (AVG) of the first and<br>
second expected outputs within allowable measurement errors, the control<br>
system uses the rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64 using sensing<br>
system 84 for various engine and powertrain control operations (318). Under<br>
a condition wherein the rotational speed, No, of the output shaft determined<br>
using sensing system 84 does not agree with the average of the first and the<br>
second expected outputs, within allowable measurement errors, the control<br>
system uses the adjusted average wheel speed, NWHL_ADJ, as a substitute the<br>
output speed for various engine and powertrain control operations (320).<br>
[0038] When the transmission is operating in one of the continuously<br>
variable modes (322), the second expected output is determined based upon<br>
the average rotational speed of the electric machines, i.e., (NA+NB)/2, and<br>
compared to the first expected output, NWHL_ADJ (324). When the values of<br>
these expected outputs are in agreement, within allowable measurement<br>
errors, an average of the first and second expected outputs is determined, and<br>
compared to the rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64 determined using<br>
sensing system 84 (326). Under a condition wherein the rotational speed, No,<br>
of the output shaft determined using sensing system 84 agrees with the<br>
average of the first and the second expected outputs, within allowable<br>
measurement errors, the control system uses the rotational speed, No, of the<br>
output shaft 64 using sensing system 84 for various engine and powertrain<br><br>
control operations (328). Under a condition wherein the rotational speed, No,<br>
of the output shaft determined using sensing system 84 does not agree with the<br>
average of the first and the second expected outputs, within allowable<br>
measurement errors, the control system uses the adjusted average wheel<br>
speed, NWHL_ADJ, as substitute for the output speed for various engine and<br>
powertrain control operations (320).<br>
[0039] Furthermore, during ongoing operation the electrical pulse output of<br>
the sensing element is monitored to determine rotational direction of the<br>
output shaft 64, as previously described. The rotational direction of the<br>
transmission output speed, No, is also determined, under all operating<br>
conditions, by mathematically adding the signed rotational speeds of the<br>
electric machines and determining the sign of the resultant:<br>
[0040] NA+NB,<br>
[0041] wherein a positive resultant of adding the numbers corresponds to<br>
forward direction, and a negative resultant of adding the numbers corresponds<br>
to reverse direction. Thus, the direction of the electrical pulse output is<br>
compared to the resultant sum of the motor speeds to determine whether the<br>
directional output from the sensor is correct. This is used to monitor the<br>
sensor and identify a fault assoC1ated therewith.<br>

disclosed embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
