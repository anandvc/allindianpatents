Method of controlling optical amplifier located along an optical link<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a technology of shutting down and restarting<br>
power optical amplifiers (more particularly, Raman amplifiers) in optical links.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Various methods for safe connection and disconnection of high power<br>
optic amplifiers in optical links have been discussed in the prior art. ,<br>
It is understood that the basic reason for shutting down lasers of the<br>
optical amplifiers is a fiber cable cut (break) or disconnection in the line; the<br>
fiber cut leads to emission of high energy light at the break point, which may<br>
cause hazardous consequences to human eyes. The most natural and widely<br>
used classic criterion indicating a fiber break is a Loss Of Signal (LOS) in the<br>
wavelengths band intended for transmitting the informational optical channels<br>
(i.e., in the C-band), being detected at the receiving point of the optical line.<br>
In optical lines deploying power Raman amplifiers, a number of non-<br>
linear effects usually develop; therefore, the above-mentioned criterion of LOS<br>
cannot be used as a universal one for detecting fiber faults of various natures.<br>
US patent 6,373,621 to Nortel Networks corporation describes a method<br>
of operating Raman amplification pump lasers, especially in<br>
telecommunication systems, in which the Raman pump laser output powers are<br>
modulated in characteristic fashions. Parameters of these characteristic<br>
modulations may be detected at remote locations (i.e. locations along the<br>
communications fibres) even in the presence of large amounts of noise. Thus,<br>
by detecting losses of signals indicative of the characteristic modulations,<br>
breaks in the communication fibres can be detected more reliably. The<br>
disappearance of these signals can then be used to shut down the typically high<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
2<br>
power Raman pump lasers, thereby reducing the possibility of high laser<br>
powers escaping from the broken fibres. The above solution also describes an<br>
improved method of detecting the disappearance of a data signal at an amplifier<br>
unit, using a periodic filter to split the incoming signal into two streams, the<br>
first stream comprising data and noise, and the second comprising noise only.<br>
These two streams are then monitored to provide an indication of the presence<br>
or absence of the data signal alone. This form of signal detection can be<br>
combined with the technique of modulating the Raman pump laser output<br>
power to provide even further improved break detection and subsequent safe<br>
shut down of pump lasers.<br>
An ITU-T Standard Recommendation G.664 (dated March 2003) named<br>
"Optical safety procedures and requirements for optical transport systems"<br>
proposes some examples of Automatic Power Reduction (APR) and Automatic<br>
Laser Shutdown (ALS) procedures for systems including those based upon<br>
Raman amplifiers. Appendixes 1 and 2 of the G.664 proposes using an Optical<br>
Supervisory Channel (OSC), when present in the system, to verify link<br>
connectivity for performing a restart. Since an OSC is usually operating at a<br>
safe optical power level, it can be kept "alive" on the fibre after the power has<br>
been reduced to a safe level. Restoration of OSC communication indicates full<br>
restoration of the link connectivity, after which the system can be brought back<br>
to its full operational power. In this way, it is ensured that the full operational<br>
power is only present in a fully enclosed configuration guaranteeing optical<br>
safety.<br>
The ALS procedure concerns restart of communication in an optical link, and is<br>
based on the use of repetitive pulses to restart the system. The Standard<br>
Recommendation specifies the minimum delay between the restart pulses for<br>
various conditions (for example, between 100s - 300 s), wherein their duration<br>
(i.e., the time period when the transmitter Tx is on) can be of about (2Â± 0.25)s.<br>
US patent No. 6,626,587 B1 to ECI Telecom Ltd. describes different<br>
modes of ALS procedure in optical telecommunication systems: a manual<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
3<br>
restart in a test mode, a manual restart and an automatic restart. The description<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
There is presently no conclusion in the prior art, which combination of<br>
criteria for shutting down and/or restarting the Raman amplifiers in the optical<br>
link could be used as the only efficient and reliable combination.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Table of key terms to be used in the following description<br>
Auxiliary optical channel - an optical channel not belonging to informational<br>
optical channels; for example, can be an OSC - Optical Supervisory Channel,<br>
an SVC - Supervisory Channel, or another additional channel.<br>
Transmitting side (power) amplifier - an optical amplifier (usually a power<br>
Raman amplifier) situated at a transmitting side of an optical span or link.<br>
Receiving side (power) amplifier - an optical amplifier (usually a power<br>
Raman amplifier) situated at a receiving side of an optical span or link.<br>
Optical Span - usually, a set of two amplifiers separated by an optical fiber<br>
normally with length of a few tens of km.<br>
Optical link - concatenation of a number (1 to n) of spans.<br>
FWD (forward direction) Raman amplifier - Raman amplifier that pumps<br>
its high output power in the direction of the information carrying signals<br>
BWD (backward direction) Raman amplifier - Raman amplifier<br>
characterized in that it pumps high output power in the opposite direction to<br>
the information carrying signals.<br>
LOS-Loss Of Signal.<br>
Main band (e.g., C-band, 1530-1565nm) - spectrum of wavelengths utilized<br>
for informational optical channels in WDM transmission.<br>
Short band (S-band, 1460-1530nm) - spectrum of wavelengths shorter than<br>
those of the C-band.<br>
Low band (L-band, 1565 - 1625nm) - spectrum of wavelength longer than<br>
those of C-band<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
4<br>
APR - Automatic Power Reduction, one of safety measures of Laser safety<br>
standards (IEC) in telecommunication systems.<br>
ALS - Automatic Laser Shutdown, one of safety measures of Laser safety<br>
standards in telecommunication systems.<br>
EDFA -Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier.<br>
The automatic restart procedure discussed in the prior art still leaves a<br>
possibility that in some cases, the power optical amplifiers can be switched on<br>
(even for a short time) when the fiber failure in the link is not yet repaired.<br>
The practice says it is insufficient and not reliable to base the decision of<br>
shutting down pumps of the Raman amplifier only on one criterion, for<br>
example only on the absence of a signal in a supervisory channel (OSC, SVC,<br>
an auxiliary channel, etc.). In other words, a random fault of the supervisory<br>
channel transmitter must not lead to the loss of a great amount of information<br>
carried by the communication link.<br>
The concept of the invention is providing an improved method of<br>
controlling (shutting down and/or restarting) of a power optical amplifier in an<br>
optical link; since the optical link usually comprises a transmitting side optical<br>
amplifier and a receiving side optical amplifier, the method in its various<br>
aspects relates to any of the amplifiers and both of them together on the link.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method<br>
of controlling an optical amplifier in an optical link comprising a transmitting<br>
side of said link, an optical fiber span and a receiving side of said link, wherein<br>
said receiving side comprises said optical amplifier being a receiving side<br>
power amplifier;<br>
the method comprises transmitting at least a first diagnostic signal via an<br>
auxiliary optical channel (SVC, OSC or the like) from the transmitting side<br>
towards the receiving side of the link;<br>
the method performs shut down of the receiving side power amplifier in<br>
case of essentially simultaneously detecting, at said receiving side of the link,<br>
absence of the diagnostic signal and at least one of the following events:<br><br>

The concept of the invention is providing an improved method of<br>
controlling (shutting down and/or restarting) of a power optical amplifier in an<br>
optical link; since the optical link usually comprises a transmitting side optical<br>
amplifier and a receiving side optical amplifier, the method in its various<br>
aspects relates to any of the amplifiers and both of them together on the link.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method<br>
of controlling an optical amplifier in an optical link comprising a transmitting<br>
side of said link, an optical fiber span and a receiving side of said link, wherein<br>
said receiving side comprises said optical amplifier being a receiving side<br>
power amplifier;<br>
the method comprises transmitting at least a first diagnostic signal via an<br>
auxiliary optical channel (SVC, OSC or the like) from the transmitting side<br>
towards the receiving side of the link;<br>
the method performs shut down of the receiving side power amplifier in<br>
case of essentially simultaneously detecting, at said receiving side of the link,<br>
absence of the diagnostic signal and at least one of the following events:<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
5<br>
drop of input signal in a main band carrying information optical<br>
channels (preferably, the main band is C-band; for example, the drop of power<br>
can be considered when the change is for about 0.5 dB);<br>
-	power reduction of input signals in both the main band and a short band;<br>
(for example, power reduction in both the C-band and S-band for more<br>
than about 0.5dB at each of them)<br>
-	disappearance of a second diagnostic signal, in case it is transmitted<br>
from the transmitting side towards the receiving side of the link.<br>
Preferably, the transmitting side of the link also comprises an optical<br>
amplifier (a transmitting side amplifier) which in turn may be a power<br>
amplifier.<br>
The term "essentially simultaneously" should be understood as detecting<br>
said events within a specified time period (or time window) between one<br>
another. Owing to different transient processes which take place at various<br>
components of the link, only approximate examples can be presented, such as<br>
from a number microseconds to 3 seconds. The time window can be more<br>
exactly specified taking into account characteristics and parameters of the<br>
power amplifiers, of the fiber connectors, of effective length of the fiber span<br>
(see explanation below) and the like.<br>
It should be noted that if the first diagnostic signal is lost and no one of<br>
the mentioned events is detected within the specified time period, the power<br>
amplifiers may remain in the working condition but are to be considered under<br>
alarm. If, at any time upon failure of the first diagnostic signal, the mentioned<br>
at least one event takes place, the power amplifier at the receiving side must be<br>
shut down since no risk can be taken any more. This situation is also in the<br>
scope of the above-defined method.<br>
If any of the "additional" listed events takes place but the first diagnostic<br>
signal does not fail within the specified time period, no shut down is performed<br>
and no alarm is required.<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
6<br>
Therefore, a risk of a false shut down is minimized to a negligible level.<br>
It should be noted that a double fault scenario is not considered in the ITU-T<br>
standardization documents when protection mechanisms are analyzed.<br>
One specific version of the above method comprises a step of<br>
transmitting the second diagnostic signal via the optical link in the same<br>
direction. This solution, by using a double overhead approach, actually resolves<br>
the problem of a possible fault of the diagnostic signal transmitter.<br>
It should be noted that the main band signal comprises a multiplexed<br>
signal of information optical channels transmitted at their corresponding<br>
wavelengths; the S-band signal comprises wavelengths shorter than the C-band.<br>
The diagnostic signal is preferably a low frequency dithering signal<br>
transmitted via an auxiliary optical channel, for example as a modulating signal<br>
of the optical carrier.<br>
Typically, the power optical amplifiers are Raman amplifiers;<br>
preferably, the transmitting side power amplifier is a Forward Direction (FWD)<br>
Raman amplifier, and the receiving side power amplifier is a Backward<br>
Direction (BWD) Raman amplifier.<br>
Shutting down of the power amplifiers can be performed by shutting<br>
down their pumps, but can also be done by reducing the amplifiers to a very<br>
low power level which cannot lead to transmitting hazardous power signals.<br>
The proposed list of events which can be detected almost simultaneously<br>
with disappearance of the first diagnostic signal in an optical link comprising<br>
power amplifiers can be described as follows. As known to those skilled in the<br>
art, optical amplifiers (and especially power amplifiers) are to be shut down in<br>
case of a fiber failure/disconnection in the optical link. It should be explained<br>
that one of the most important non-linear effects created by high power Raman<br>
amplifiers is Rayligh back scattering. This phenomena causes creation of noise<br>
in both the C-band and S-band, which is amplified not only in the direction of<br>
the Raman pump, but more importantly in this case, counter pump wise.<br>
The Inventor generally classified the possible fiber failures into three<br>
types:<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
7<br>
1.fiber cut remote from the receiving power amplifier; it is characterized by<br>
essential drop of power in the band of optical channels, (preferably, in the C-<br>
band);<br>
2.fiber cut close to the receiving amplifier (within a so-called effective length,<br>
for example it can be of about 20 km); this distance is characterized by noise<br>
in C-band and S-band caused by the known effect of back pumping of Raman<br>
amplifiers. This noise makes it impossible to detect LOS which would<br>
normally be discovered after a fiber cut or disconnecting along the span. A<br>
fiber cut within the effective distance leads to a reduction of noise signals in the<br>
C-band and S-band<br>
3.open connector of the receiving power amplifier causes the phenomena<br>
characteristic for type 2; in case of a flat surface of the fiber cross-section in<br>
the open connector, such a fault may also cause sharp increase in a so-called<br>
Back Reflection, up to reaching extremely high Back Reflection (HBR)<br>
exceeding a predetermined threshold.<br>
The method may optionally comprise determining the type of fault that<br>
has caused shut down of the receiving side power amplifier; the determination<br>
(the diagnosis) can be based on specific combination of the events detected<br>
essentially simultaneously with the absence of said at least one diagnostic<br>
signal. The diagnosis preferably comprises indication of the type of fault.<br>
Further, the method may comprise detailed analysis of the type of fault.<br>
For example, the amount of power returned as the High Back Reflection effect<br>
can be indicative of the distance from the receiving side power amplifier. In<br>
other words, knowing the returning power, the type of the amplifier and<br>
characteristics of the fiber, the distance can be calculated.<br>
The method according to the first aspect of the invention may be utilized<br>
also in a case when said optical link is one unidirectional link from a pair of<br>
two unidirectional links forming together a bi-directional optical link.<br>
There is also proposed a method of controlling an optical amplifier in an<br>
optical link comprising a transmitting side of said link, an optical fiber span<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
8<br>
and a receiving side of said link, wherein said transmitting side comprises said<br>
optical amplifier being a transmitting side power amplifier;<br>
the method comprises shutting down the transmitting side power<br>
amplifier of the optical link upon detecting at least one of the following events:<br>
-reduction of power simultaneously in the main band and in the S-band at<br>
the output of the transmitting side power amplifier,<br>
-High Back Reflection exceeding a predetermined threshold.<br>
For the optical link that belongs to a bi-directional optical link, the above<br>
method includes shutting down of the transmitting side power amplifier also in<br>
case of detecting Loss of Signal (LOS) in the main band of informational<br>
optical channels at (or before) the input of the transmitting side power<br>
amplifier.<br>
The above method may be performed together with the previously<br>
described method of shutting down the receiving side power amplifier.<br>
The main band is typically C-band, though L-band can sometimes be<br>
used for transmitting of informational channels. The mentioned power<br>
reduction is, for example, in the range of more than 0.5 dB in the main band<br>
and in the S-band. However, it should be noted that the Raman effect occurs for<br>
any wavelength band whatsoever - for example the Raman effect can work<br>
also in 1300,1400, 1600 nm ranges and fully depends on the lasers used in the<br>
Raman amplifier.<br>
As noted, the above criteria are suitable for shutting down the<br>
transmitting side power amplifier in a bi-directional optical link. These criteria<br>
are independent from a method of shutting down the receiving side power<br>
amplifier (for example, the latter can be shut down without utilizing a<br>
diagnostic signal).<br>
The above phenomena to be detected for shutting down the transmitting<br>
side power amplifier can be explained by the same three categories of the fiber<br>
faults listed with respect to the receiving side power amplifier.<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
9<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is proposed an<br>
improved method of controlling an optical amplifier in an optical link<br>
comprising a transmitting side of said link, an optical fiber span and a receiving<br>
side of said link, wherein said transmitting side comprises said optical amplifier<br>
being a transmitting side amplifier;<br>
the method comprises<br>
transmitting a first and a second diagnostic counter-propagating signal<br>
from the receiving side towards the transmitting side of the link;<br>
shutting down the transmitting side amplifier in case of detecting, at said<br>
transmitting side of the link, disappearance of said first and said second<br>
diagnostic counter-propagating signals.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the transmitting side amplifier is a power<br>
amplifier.<br>
In one embodiment, the second diagnostic counter-propagating signal<br>
can be transmitted via an additional auxiliary optical channel.<br>
The above-defined solution dramatically simplifies the process of<br>
shutting down the power optical amplifier at the transmitting side of the link,<br>
and allows performing it without interaction with another optical link usually<br>
serving the opposite traffic direction.<br>
Using two diagnostic signals transmitted by separate transmitters<br>
renders the above method more reliable.<br>
The method according to the second aspect of the invention (i.e.,<br>
shutting down the transmitting side amplifier based on detecting disappearance<br>
of diagnostic counter-propagating signals) may be utilized also in a case when<br>
said optical link is one unidirectional link from a pair of two unidirectional<br>
links forming together a bi-directional optical link. It is independent from a<br>
method of shutting down the receiving side amplifier (i.e., the latter can be shut<br>
down without utilizing any diagnostic signal(s).<br>
It is to be mentioned that to restart the receiving side amplifier (power or<br>
not), it is sufficient that presence of said at least first diagnostic signal be<br>
detected at the receiving side of the link.<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
10<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there is proposed an<br>
improved method of controlling an optical amplifier in an optical link, wherein<br>
the optical link comprises a transmitting side of said link, an optical fiber span<br>
and a receiving side of said link, wherein said transmitting side comprises said<br>
optical amplifier being a transmitting side amplifier;<br>
the method comprises<br>
transmitting a first diagnostic counter-propagating signal and a second<br>
diagnostic counter-propagating signal from the receiving side to the<br>
transmitting side of the link;<br>
restarting the transmitting side amplifier, previously shut down, in case<br>
of detecting presence of at least one of said diagnostic counter-propagating<br>
signals at the transmitting side of the link.<br>
The proposed method is most preferred for a case where the transmitting<br>
side optical amplifier is a power amplifier.<br>
The above method of restarting the transmitting side power/nonpower<br>
amplifier is simple, fast and reliable, especially in comparison with the methods<br>
known in the prior art. These methods can be successfully implemented also in<br>
a bi-directional link.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is further proposed a<br>
method for restarting a transmitting side power amplifier in a bi-directional<br>
link, improving a standardized ALS procedure described in the ITU-T G.664.<br>
There is provided a method of controlling an optical amplifier in a bi-<br>
directional optical link consisting of a first and a second unidirectional optical<br>
links, each comprising a transmitting side, an optical fiber span, and a receiving<br>
side, wherein at least the first unidirectional link at its transmitting side<br>
comprises said optical amplifier being a transmitting side power amplifier;<br>
the method comprises:<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
11<br>
a) transmitting at least a first diagnostic signal via an auxiliary optical<br>
channel from the transmitting side of the first unidirectional link towards the<br>
receiving side of the first unidirectional link, and<br>
performing the following operations for restarting the transmitting side<br>
power amplifier of the first unidirectional link in case said amplifier has been<br>
shut down<br>
b)	applying restart pulses having duration X and periodicity T (X<t></t>
towards the transmitting side power amplifier,<br>
c)	verifying connectivity of the first unidirectional link by monitoring<br>
presence of said at least first diagnostic signal at the receiving side of said<br>
link,<br>
d)	ensuring applying of power exceeding a LOS threshold toward the<br>
input of the transmitting side power amplifier whenever the connectivity is<br>
restored,<br>
e)	allowing the transmitting side power amplifier to restart only after<br>
time greater than X, during which its input power exceeded said LOS<br>
threshold.<br>
It should be clarified that in case the transmitting side power amplifier<br>
of the first unidirectional link is shut down (for example, due to a fiber cut in<br>
the first unidirectional link), power applied to its input does not exceed a LOS<br>
(Loss Of Signal) threshold. This is ensured owing to an SD (Shut Down)<br>
command received at the receiving side of the first unidirectional link via the<br>
second unidirectional link, in case of detecting the fiber cut at the receiving<br>
side of the first link; the mechanism will be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to Fig. 2.<br>
To implement the above method, a delay (X+â) <t can be introduced></t>
by providing a delay circuit at the input of the transmitting side power<br>
amplifier.<br>
In a further embodiment, the first unidirectional optical link may<br>
comprise a booster preceding the transmitting side power amplifier, and the<br>
method may comprise introducing said delay X+â also to said booster by<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
12<br>
providing the booster with a booster delay circuit to ensure that the power level<br>
of a restart pulse transmitted with the duration X to the optical link will never<br>
have time to be amplified above a safety threshold. For example, the safety<br>
threshold for class 1 is l0dBm. Therefore, the method guarantees that power<br>
caused in the link by the restart pulse will not rise higher than l0dBm for X+â,<br>
so the system will not violate class 1 safety once the fiber is cut.<br>
There is yet a further version of the method defined above, wherein the<br>
delay is introduced only in a booster preceding the transmitting side power<br>
amplifier, in this version<br>
the step of applying the restart pulses comprises applying thereof to said<br>
booster, while enabling the booster to produce output power above a safety<br>
threshold only upon expiration of said delay;<br>
whenever the connectivity is restored (and reported via the second<br>
unidirectional link to the transmitting side of said first unidirectional link), the<br>
method further comprises applying a main band power level to the booster,<br>
thereby enabling said booster to restart the transmitting side power amplifier<br>
upon expiration of said delay counted from the leading edge of either a restart<br>
pulse or the power level, whatever comes earlier.<br>
Preferably, the booster (say, an EDFA amplifier) introduces a delay<br>
X+â, (X+â<t said delay being synchronized with the leading edge of a></t>
power level exceeding the LOS threshold applied to the booster, being it a next<br>
restart pulse or the main band power level. It can be performed by enabling<br>
the booster to gradually or stepwise increase its output power (to be the input<br>
power of the transmitting side Raman amplifier) during the delay period X+â,<br>
so that at the end of said period the output power of the booster, if required, be<br>
sufficient to fully activate the Raman amplifier of the transmitting side.<br>
Value of the "A" for any of the versions, can be selected taking into<br>
account specific safety requirements and various limitations of the optical link.<br>
Ranges of delta can be, for example, (0- few seconds). Ranges of output power<br>
of the booster can be, for example, of about 10-23dBm, and ranges of the<br>
Raman output power can be of about 20-40 dBm.<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
13<br>
The restart pulses are applied at the main band and have the amplitude<br>
exceeding the LOS threshold . According to the mentioned standard, the main<br>
band is the band which carries information channels. It should be kept in mind<br>
that the restart procedure also includes applying corresponding pulses of the<br>
diagnostic signal in the auxiliary channel.<br>
Restoration of the connectivity is immediately followed by sensing the<br>
diagnostic signal at the receiving side of the first unidirectional link, restarting<br>
the receiving side power amplifier of the first link, which fact is immediately<br>
reported to the transmitting side of the first link via the opposite (second)<br>
unidirectional link of the bi-directional link. (The report is actually<br>
disappearance of a Shut Down (SD) command, which was received all the time<br>
the fiber cut was present). The report is immediately interpreted by starting the<br>
transmitting laser and appearance of the main band (C-band) signal at the input<br>
of the booster. Presence of me C-band signal at the input of the booster for the<br>
period more than X can be caused only by detecting integrity of the fiber,<br>
which means that the fiber cut/failure has been repaired.<br>
As has been mentioned above, both the transmitting side of the link and<br>
the receiving side of the link usually comprise optical amplifiers; in our<br>
particular case they both can be power optical amplifiers. The power optical<br>
amplifiers are typically Raman amplifiers; preferably, the transmitting side<br>
power amplifier is a Forward Direction (FWD) Raman amplifier, and the<br>
receiving side power amplifier is a Backward Direction (BWD) Raman<br>
amplifier. The restart of the power amplifiers is performed by restarting their<br>
pumps. The mentioned at least one diagnostic signal is preferably a low<br>
frequency signal as it enables its detection without amplification over long<br>
spans (required at the start up stage when Raman amplifiers are still in their<br>
shut mode).<br>
The above-defined improvement of the restart process is in that the<br>
Inventor proposes to add to the standard automatic restart process (ALS) a<br>
condition preventing activation of the transmitting side Raman amplifier pumps<br>
without getting a stable proof that there is no fiber cut/open connector in the<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
14<br>
link. Otherwise, high energy of the Raman amplifier might result in a damage<br>
at the place of fiber cut. First of all, the invention prevents automatic restart of<br>
the transmitting Raman amplifier each time the standard ALS process "tries"<br>
doing that during the period "X". It is performed by preventing the booster<br>
from generating its high (above a defined hazard level, e.g class 1 = l0dBm)<br>
output power during the time period equal to the duration of a standard restart<br>
pulse. The high power is generated with a delay (say, by introducing a timer<br>
circuit) set for the time longer than the predetermined "X" seconds. Thus, at<br>
each cycle of the standardized ALS process, the proposed method allows<br>
skipping the undesired automatic attempt to restart the Raman amplifier, during<br>
the standard "X" seconds. The novel proposed artificial "delay" timer set for<br>
"X+â" allows the restart when the fiber cut is repaired, i.e., when the input<br>
power is applied towards the power amplifier for the time period longer than X.<br>
The proposed method of the improved automatic restart (and a system<br>
implementing the method) can be compatible with the standardized ALS<br>
procedure described in the ITU-T G.664.<br>
However, the restart pulses X can be much shorter than those<br>
recommended in the above standard, thus the restart procedure may be<br>
performed much faster. For example, X can be set for 100 ms, so that the whole<br>
cycle can be closed in less than 500 ms.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Fig. 1A illustrates an exemplary unidirectional link 1 comprising an optical<br>
fiber span extending between a transmitting node 2 and a receiving node 3. The<br>
transmitting node 3 usually comprises an optical amplifier 4 and two<br>
transmitters 5A and 5B of a diagnostic signal 1 and a diagnostic signal 2,<br>
respectively. The two diagnostic signals are transmitted via two separate optical<br>
auxiliary channels, though (in principle) may be propagated through one<br>
common optical channel in the form of two different modulating signals. The<br>
node also comprises a coupler (multiplexer) for transmitting the two diagnostic<br>
signals along the optical link, multiplexed with signals of the informational<br>
optical channels incoming the transmitting node. The node 2 may additionally<br>
comprise other equipment which is not discussed with reference to this<br>
drawing.<br>
The receiving node 3 comprises an optical amplifier 6. It also contains two<br>
receivers 7A and 7B of the diagnostic signals 1 and 2 connected to the link via<br>
a splitter (filter, demultiplexer); the receivers may be provided with, or operate<br>
themselves as detectors D1 and D2 of the two diagnostic signals.<br>
The amplifiers 4 and 6 are preferably power optical amplifiers which must be<br>
immediately (i.e., according to strict time requirements specified in relevant<br>
standards) shut down whenever a fault occurs in the optical link.<br>
Using the embodiment of Fig. 1a, in case of a fiber cut in the link, the amplifier<br>
6 of the receiving node 3 can be shut down based on detection of absence of<br>
both diagnostic signals. If only one of the signals has disappeared, it would just<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
16<br>
mean that one of the transmitters 5A or 5B (or receivers/detectors 7A,7B) has<br>
failed. The receiving node 3 may optionally comprise additional<br>
monitors/detectors, for example a C-band detector, an S-band detector. The<br>
additional detectors, in combination with detection of at least one of the<br>
diagnostic signal at the receiving node, can be used for sensing a fault in the<br>
optical link (see a unidirectional link 12 in Fig. 2). Upon detecting the fault, the<br>
amplifier 6 of the receiving node 3 will be shut down.<br>
The illustrated solution suits for a unidirectional optical link, but it can<br>
be used in each unidirectional link of a bi-directional optical link.<br>
If the unidirectional link 1 is not part of a bi-directional link, shut down<br>
of the amplifier 4 at the transmitting node is quite problematic since it does not<br>
receive any information (alarms) from its own fiber span. The fault might<br>
probably be determined by detecting increased Back Reflection from the cut<br>
surface, and/or by quite sharp reduction in the noise power at C-band and S-<br>
band at the output of the amplifier 4.<br>
In any case, shutting down the transmitting side amplifier 4 by no means<br>
can be based on disappearance of the diagnostic signals 1 or 2, since it can<br>
indicate nothing more than operability of the diagnostic signals transmitters.<br>
Fig. 1B proposes a solution for reliable detection of fiber faults at a receiving<br>
node of an exemplary unidirectional link. Of course, the solution can be used<br>
also for bi-directional optical links. Fig. 1B shows a unidirectional link 101 that<br>
incorporates equipment for transmitting two "counter-propagating" diagnostic<br>
signals 3 and 4. Both these diagnostic signals 3 and 4 are transmitted in the<br>
direction opposite to the traffic channels, via one or two auxiliary optical<br>
channels). The solution is based on the fact that optical fibers can be used for<br>
transmitting information in two opposite directions.<br>
Since in this embodiment the transmitting node 102 becomes a receiving node<br>
for the diagnostic counter-propagating signals 3 and 4, this transmitting node<br>
102 is able to easily detect a fault in the link if both of the diagnostic counter-<br>
propagating signals disappear. If one of the counter-propagating signals is not<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
17<br>
detected, it may only mean failure of the corresponding transmitter Tx.<br>
Actually, the unidirectional link may utilize only one transmitter 105A and one<br>
receiver 107A for a diagnostic counter-propagating signal 3 transmitted from<br>
the node 103 to the node 102. Even in this case the transmitting node 102 will<br>
be capable of detecting fiber faults in the link quite reliably (by sensing absence<br>
of the signal 3). In case the amplifier 104 is a power amplifier (say, a Raman<br>
amplifier), reliability of the fault detection at the transmitting node 102 can be<br>
increased if some other physical phenomena are detected simultaneously with<br>
disappearance of the utilized counter-propagating channel(s). For example,<br>
these factors can be a) the increased Back Reflection b) reduction of noise in<br>
the C- band and/or S-band at the output of the amplifier 104.<br>
Fig. 1B shows a preferred specific embodiment where the unidirectional link<br>
101 is also provided with equipment for transmitting one or more co-<br>
propagating diagnostic signals 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a bi-directional optical link 10 comprising two unidirectional<br>
links 12 and 112 serving opposite transmission directions. In this particular<br>
example, each of the links 12 and 112 extends between a multiplexer 16 (116)<br>
and a demultiplexer 18 (118). Transmitting lasers of the links are not shown.<br>
The scheme of Fig. 2 is relevant also for single channel applications.<br>
In this embodiment, multiplexed information optical channel(s) issued by the<br>
multiplexer 16 as a C-band signal are fed to block 20 that contains a<br>
transmitting Raman amplifier 22. The block 20 also comprises an EDFA<br>
amplifier (shown as a two-stage amplifier or booster 24) and a multiplexer 26<br>
combining the multiplexed C-band signal with a dithering (diagnostic) signal<br>
transmitted by a dithering transmitter 28 via an auxiliary optical SVC channel.<br>
The block 20 is provided with at least four detectors schematically shown in<br>
this embodiment as four square fields 30, 32, 34, 35 within the Raman<br>
amplifier sub-block 22. Actually, the Raman amplifier sub-blocks 22 and 40<br>
in the link 10 can be performed as identical printed circuits comprising one and<br>
the same set of monitoring detectors. In this embodiment, the transmitting<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
18<br>
power amplifiers 22 and 140 (in the respective links 12 and 112) are FWD<br>
Raman amplifiers, and the receiving power amplifiers 40 and 122 (of the links<br>
12 and 112) are BWD Raman amplifiers.<br>
The detectors 30, 32, 34, 35 are respectively responsible for monitoring power<br>
of the: C-band signal, Short band (S-band or noise) signal, the dithering signal,<br>
and back reflection BR, and can be placed at any position within the block 20.<br>
The transmitting amplifier's block 20 is connected, via a fiber span 36, to a<br>
block 38 containing a receiving amplifier 40. The block 38, in addition to the<br>
Raman amplifier 40 (in this case, the BWD Raman), comprises a demultiplexer<br>
(splitter) 42 for splitting the C-band information optical channels from the SVC<br>
channel, a dithering channel receiver 44 and an additional amplifier 46 that is<br>
further connected to the multiplexer 18. Similarly to the block 20, block 38<br>
comprises monitoring detectors of the C-band signal 48, of the S-band signal<br>
50, of the dithering signal 52 and of the back reflection BR 54, The monitoring<br>
detectors are shown as an example within the receiving Raman amplifier sub-<br>
block 40.<br>
The optical link 112 serving the opposite transmission direction comprises<br>
similar components marked by similar respective numbers (120,138, etc.).<br>
It should be understood that the optical fibers 36 and 136 of the bi-<br>
directional communication link 10 extend between two nodes, wherein<br>
multiplexer 16 , block 20 demultiplexer 118 and block 120 belong to one of<br>
the nodes, and demultiplexer 18, block 38, multiplexer 116 and block 138<br>
belong to the other node. A transmitter and a receiver of the dithering signal<br>
belonging to one and the same node (say, 28 and 128) preferably fonn a<br>
common functional block and may serve identical auxiliary optical channels in<br>
the two optical links.<br>
The nodes collect information concerning connectivity of the two<br>
unidirectional links 12 and 112 and operability of the relevant equipment, and<br>
constantly exchange the relevant information with one another.<br>
For example, if a fiber cut occurs in the span 36 (marked with a dotted<br>
cross) and takes place quite far from the block 38, it can be detected at the<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
19<br>
receiving block 38 by simultaneously detecting LOS of the dithering signal in<br>
SVC and essential power drop in the C-band. The receiving Raman amplifier<br>
40 will be therefore shut down and the Shut Down signal SD will be<br>
transmitted to the demultiplexer 18, from which it is sent to the mutiplexer 116<br>
of the opposite link 112 (see a schematic signaling-arrow 56).<br>
Once the BWD is shut, LOS is detected at the amplifier 46 following it,<br>
which causes it to shut. This creates LOS at the Demultiplexer (DMUX)18,<br>
which might cause SD command for the MUX 116 on link 112 (arrow 56).<br>
Moreover, there can be another scenario where the LOS at the DMUX<br>
propagates to the Rx of the transceiver (not shown) located after the DMUX.<br>
The Rx than creates a SD command to the Tx. (SD at the MUX 116 will cause<br>
LOS in 146 and consequently its shut down, which will cause a LOS in 140<br>
and hence its shut down.<br>
In parallel, the absence of the dithering signal in SVC, and the shut<br>
down of the BWD Raman 40 create a LOS in the receiver 44 causing a SD<br>
command for transmitter 144.<br>
So, as we have seen above, link 112 will also be shut down, as the<br>
receiving amplifier (BWD Raman amplifier) 122 will have a simultaneous drop<br>
in C band and LOS of a dithering signal of the link 112.<br>
Shut down of 122 will cause LOS at preamplifier 124, which will shut<br>
down and cause LOS in Demultiplexer 118. A shut down (SD) signal will be<br>
immediately sent from the Demultiplexer 118 to the multiplexer 16 (arrow 58),<br>
and the C-band signal at the input of the block 20 will be ceased, thus causing<br>
LOS at booster amplifier 24 input, causing it to shut and hence causing LOS at<br>
the FWD Raman amplifier 22 input, which in turn causes it to shut down, thus<br>
accomplishing the purpose of the mechanism ( as no hazardous laser light is<br>
emitted to the cut or disconnected fiber).<br>
If the fiber cut occurs closer to the receiving block 38, it can be detected<br>
at this block by sensing the absence of the dithering signal accompanied by a<br>
sharp reduction of noise in at least one of the C-band and S-band. In case there<br>
is an open fiber connector in the receiving block 38, the absence of the<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
20<br>
dithering signal will be further accompanied by a High back Reflection over a<br>
known threshold specified for each particular Raman amplifier/connector.<br>
It should be noted that "shut down of a Raman amplifier" is to be<br>
understood as shutting down its power pumps or, say, reducing the pumps to a<br>
very low level so as not to transmit hazardous power levels to the optical line.<br>
A similar statement applies to ways of shutting down the booster.<br>
Now, let us consider that upon shutting down pumps of the Raman<br>
amplifiers, the link must be restored, so the Raman amplifiers are to be re-<br>
started. The restart process is standardized by the ALS procedure described in<br>
the ITU-T G.664. The present invention proposes utilizing the standardized<br>
ALS procedure, but in an enhanced version that is made to improve both safety<br>
of the restart and the reaction time.<br>
For example, the duration of the restart pulses can be e.g., 100 ms<br>
(compare to 1.75 -2.25 s according to the mentioned Standard), so that the<br>
whole circle is closed in less than 500 ms.<br>
One version of the method of restart will be described with reference to<br>
both Fig. 2 and Figs 3A-3D. The standardized ALS procedure can be<br>
implemented using an ALS timer (Fig. 3A; not shown in Fig. 2) that produces<br>
periodical pulses of the logical level "1" with the duration X. Simultaneously,<br>
the ALS timer monitors whether connectivity of the link 12 is restored. The<br>
ALS timer controls periodic activation of both the main band and the auxiliary<br>
channel (SVC) carrying the diagnostic dithering signal, thus trying to resume<br>
contact every period "T" for time "X". The ALS procedure is usually<br>
performed at both unidirectional links, but for the sake of simplicity, will be<br>
explained below with respect to one of the links.<br>
As have been explained before, restoration of the link 12 can be sensed<br>
at the block 38 if a dithering signal is detected in the SVC channel. Detection<br>
of the dithering signal is the sufficient criterion of re-activating the receiving<br>
power amplifier 38. Provided that all the signaling between the unidirectional<br>
links operates as usual, the link 112 restores its normal operation and provides<br>
the ALS timer with such an indication.<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
21<br>
Suppose that at the moment tl the ALS timer received a signal about<br>
integrity of the link 12 and started generating a constant positive logical level<br>
"1". The ALS timer correspondingly initiates an exemplary laser transmitter<br>
(Tx laser - not shown in Fig. 2) to apply C-band restart pulses having duration<br>
X (two such pulses are shown; their duration can be standard or shortened) and,<br>
beginning from the moment tl - the level ("a step") of the C-band signal to a<br>
booster 24. The amplitude of the signals is greater than the Loss Of Signal<br>
(LOS) threshold but does not exceed the level 1 safety requirements. The time<br>
diagram of the laser Tx is shown in Fig. 3B and is logically similar to the time<br>
diagram of the ALS timer (diagram of Fig. 3A).<br>
Alternatively, the control logical levels of the ALS timer, instead of<br>
being applied to the channels' laser transceivers, can be used at the MUX 16<br>
(say, at its output interface) or at a preamplifier of the Booster 24. In this case<br>
the channels' transceivers are constantly active.<br>
According to the concept, the transmitting side power amplifier 22 is not<br>
allowed to restart its power pumps in response to any of those pulses, as long as<br>
the fiber cut is not repaired. According to the version illustrated in Fig. 3, the<br>
booster 24 operates as a delay circuit which has the delay time "X1 =X+â"<br>
greater than "X" but smaller than T and is synchronized to the beginning of a<br>
C-band input signal, whether the signal is a standard pulse of the duration X or<br>
"the step" caused by elimination of the fiber cut (- see Fig. 3C). The booster<br>
24 increases its output power step-wise in response to the applied input power,<br>
so as to remain at the safe level l0dBm during the pulse X plus the "spare"<br>
additional time A, and to reach its full output power sufficient for re-starting<br>
the Raman amplifier 22 only at the end of its delay time X+â (of course, if the<br>
booster's input power so dictates).<br>
According to an alternative and more preferred version, both the booster<br>
24 and the FWD Raman amplifier are provided with the same timer (counter)<br>
X+â.. Once the Booster 24 is out of LOS (i.e., its input power exceeds a Loss<br>
Of Signal threshold), it hnmediately starts amplifying with output power not<br><br>
WO 2006/067788	PCT/IL2005/001364<br>
22<br>
greater than a predefined safety threshold (e.g. 10 dBm). Only after X+â, and if<br>
dictated by the value of its input power, the booster 24 will go up to required<br>
powers greater than l0dBm. (Not always the booster output is required to be<br>
above l0dBm. For example, a single channel will be transmitted with 5dBm, so<br>
even after X+delta the output power does not have to change.) The Raman<br>
amplifier 22 also starts its X+â counter from the moment it is out of LOS. And<br>
than, independent of what the input power is ( being the output power of the<br>
booster 22), as long as it is above its LOS threshold, the Raman amplifier 22<br>
will start amplifying after time X+â.<br>
The time diagram of Fig. 3D illustrates restart of the Raman amplifier 22<br>
that takes place at the moment t2, according to any one of the described<br>
versions.<br>
The proposed method allows performing a safe restart of both the<br>
Booster amplifier 24 and the power Raman amplifier 22.<br>
The restart pulses X can be much shorter than those recommended in the<br>
standard (1.75-2.25 sec), thus the restart procedure may be performed much<br>
faster. For example, X can be set for 100 ms, so that the whole cycle is closed<br>
in less than 500 ms.<br>
It should be appreciated that the above description comprises only some<br>
exemplary combinations of criteria useful for making the shut down and restart<br>
decisions concerning the power optical amplifiers in optical links. Additional<br>
variations of the criteria that can be proposed and remain in the frame of the<br>
spirit of the invention and the scope of the claims presented below, should be<br>
