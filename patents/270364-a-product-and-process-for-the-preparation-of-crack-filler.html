THE PATENTS RULE, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; Rule 13)<br>
"THE PRODUCT AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE READYMADE PUTTY POWDER"<br>
BADAMIKAR HRISHIKESH RAGHVENDRA INDIAN NATIONAL, HAVING ADDRESS AT FLAT NO. 9, NAVODAYA REGENCY, HOTGI ROAD, SOLAPUR*413 003, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
The present invention relates to a product and process for the preparation of the readymade putty powder. More particularly present invention relates to a product and process for the preparation of the readymade putty powder useful to fill the Gaps, Holes, Cracks in Wood, Sculpture Art, Plywood And Cracks in the Walls, and the like..<br>
PRIOR ART:-<br>
ln Prior Art furniture makers were using wood powder or whiting or fly ash or plaster of paris, chalk powder, tamarind seed powder with suitable adhesive ie. White glue, M-seal, Metal paste, Wax are also used as a crack filler. There are certain drawbacks and deficiencies, which are as follows:<br>
1.	When wood powder mixed with adhesive and filled the cracks, it shows colour difference since the dried wood powder becomes darker in shade than natural wood.<br>
2.	When whiting mixed with adhesive and filled in the cracks of wooden surface, it cracks after drying and comes out from the wood.<br>
3.	When plaster of paris is mixed with adhesive and filled in the cracks, it can also come out from the wood.<br>
4.	When fly ash is mixed with adhesive and filled in the cracks, it shows colour difference.<br>
5.	When chalk powder or tamarind seed powder mixed with adhesive, it also cracks and comes out from the wood.<br>
6.	When M-seal, metal paste is used as filler which is generally available in two pack system, it has short shelf life and pot life. It is not suitable for wood.<br>
7.	When wax is used as filler, it melts down in summer.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:-<br>
The object of the present invention aims at developing a product and process for<br>
the preparation of the readymade putty powder.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to develop a product which can stick<br>
up with wood<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop the crack filler for wood<br>
having excellent holding capacity with wood and the product which shall  not fall<br>
off from the wood after drying.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to fulfill the requirements of the<br>
furniture makers and plywood manufacturers by developing a product which fills<br>
the cracks does not fall down from the filled surface.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to develop a product, which does not<br>
form cracks on the applied area and which shrinks very less when used as filler.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to fill the surface which can be<br>
carved with wood.<br>
it is also an object of the present invention to develop a product, which can<br>
match with the wood colour and also cost effective.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to eliminate the short falls and<br>
drawbacks of prior art.<br>
According to this invention, therefore, a readymade putty powder comprising of filler, strengthening material and binder in the ratio of 85 to 70 as to 15 to 5 as to 15 as to 5, by volume respectively with or without fast drying material and/or fly Ash or whiting and suitable colours.<br>
Further according to this invention, A process for the preparation of the readymade putty powder comprising the steps of i) mixing by any conventional method predefined amount by volume of filler, strengthening material and binder<br><br>
to form the product crack filler ii) adding predefined volume of water to the said product crack filler to form the thick paste of the product crack filler iii) adding the suitable colours to formed the paste of step (ii) and iv) applying the said paste of suitable colour to the cracks in the sufficient quantity.<br>
Fast Drying Materials like Anhydrous Magnesium Sulphate Or Calcium Sulphate (POP)(Particle Size 45 to 75 Microns) 2.5 to 20 Parts by Volume can be added. Smooth Paste Makers like Fly Ash Or Whiting (Particle Size 45 to 75 Microns) 2.5 to 20 Parts by Volume can be added.<br>
