DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
". The extrusion 10 shown in Figures 1 and 5 comprises an elongate main plate 12 which has parallel grooves. 14 running along the length thereof. The grooves 14 facilitate the driving of fasteners such as pop rivets through the plate 12 to fasten it to a vertical surface as will be described hereinafter. A web 16 slopes upwardly from the lower edge of the plate 12. The web includes a narrow flange 18 along the upper edge thereof, the flange 18 having an elongate recess 20 in the underside thereof. The recess 20 forms an elongate socket which extends along the free edge of the web and in the surface thereof which faces away from the plate 12.<br>
The face retaining extrusion 22 of Figures 2 and 6 is very generally C-shaped in section. The lower part of the extrusion 22 defines a shallow, upwardly open elongate socket 24 and the upper part  of the extrusion 22 defines a downwardly open elongate recess 28. The recess 28 is bounded by part of the C-shaped outer wall 30 of the extrusion 22, by an inner wall 32 which lies generally parallel to and spaced from the wall 30, and by a return bend 34 which joins the upper ends of the walls 30 and 32. A display panel tensioning plate 36 protrudes from the outer face of the return bend 34<br><br>
and extends the full length of the extrusion. The free edge of the plate 36, in use, bears on the display panel. The socket 24 and the parts of the extrusion 22 which bound the socket 24 form a hook structure.<br>
The locking extrusion 38 of Figures 3 and 7 comprises a main flap 40 which has two bends 42 and 44 therein. The part of the extrusion between the bend 42 and one free edge of the extrusion 38 constitutes a manually grippable locking and unlocking portion. The extrusion 38 further includes a part circular return bend 46 which terminates in an enlarged bead 48. The bend 46 and bead 48 constitute a hook structure. A pivot plate 50 protrudes outwardly from the return bend 46. The edge of the plate 50 remote from the hook structure constitutes a pivot edge.<br>
The extrusion 52 of Figures 4 and 8 is in essence a combination of the extrusions 22 and 38. Where applicable, therefore, like references have been used with the addition of the suffix .1.<br>
A rib 54 is provided which extends along the full length of the extrusion 52.<br>
All the extrusions are preferably of aluminium although a sufficiently rigid synthetic plastics material can be used.<br><br>
The display panel 56 (see Figures 13 and 14) on which the advertisement : is carried has all four of its edge portions turned-over and welded or sewn at 58 to the   . adjacent parts of the panei thereby to form elongate pockets 60. Stiffening strips 62 of plastics material or aluminium are inserted into the pockets 60 and run the full lengths of the pockets. The display panel 56 will normally be a printed vinyl sheet.<br>
A vehicle body side or other surface to which the display panel 56 is to be " secured is shown at 64in Figures 10 and 12.   -...""<br>
Two lengths of the extrusion 10 are secured parallel to one another along the top and bottom edges of the surface64 with the web 16 of the upper extrusion 10 sloping downwardly and the web 16 of the lower extrusion sloping upwardly. This is illustrated in Figures 9 to 12. The fasteners which secure the extrusions 10 to the surface 64 have not been shown.<br>
The recess 28.1 of the extrusion 52 is upwardly open and the pocket along the upper edge of the face 56 is inserted into it through its open upper end. The display panel 56 bends around the free edge of the wall 32.1 and extends downwardly . adjacent the outer face of the wall 32.1.<br>
The lower pocket is similarly inserted into the downwardly open lower recess 28 from below and the hook structures of the extrusions 22 and 38 interengaged<br><br>
by sliding the end part of the bend 46 and the bead 48 into the socket 24. The rib 54 is then placed in the upwardly open socket 20 of the upper extrusion 10 so that the display panel 56 and the extrusions 22, 38 hang from the upper extrusion 10.<br>
The pivot plate 50 of the extrusion 38 is then inserted under the flange 18. and into the recess 20 as seen in Figures 9 and 10. The locking portion at the free end of the extrusion 38 is then swung in downward arc, as indicated by arrow A in Figure 10. The lower extrusion 22 is thus pulled downwardly and inwardly towards the surface 60, As the extrusion 38 moves past its bottom dead centre position it snaps towards the surface 60.<br>
The free edges of the tensioning plates 36 and 36.1 bear on the face 56 where it emerges from behind the upper and lower mountings and assist in tensioning the panel. The lower plate 36 also prevents dirt, leaves and other debris collecting between the face 56 and the wall 32.<br>
As best seen in Figure 11, the appearance of the upper mounting is substantially the same as that of the lower mounting despite the fact that a different number of extrusions are employed.<br>
The vertically extending edges of the display panel can be secured in place in the same way as the horizontally extending edges. More specifically, further<br><br>
extrusions 10 are mounted on the surface 60, these extrusions 10 extending vertically and being horizontally spaced. An extrusion 52 is used in conjunction with one vertically extending extrusion 10 and extrusions 22 and 38 in conjunction with the other vertically extending extrusion 10. The upper and lower horizontally extending mountings will normally be locked as described above before the mountings along the vertical edges of the display panel. All four edges will normally be secured where the surface 60 is on a moving vehicle but two edges can be left free if the surface 60 is stationary. For aesthetic reasons, however, it is desirable to secure all four edges of the display panel 56.<br>
Referring now to Figures 15 to 22, these illustrate the four extrusions which constitute a further mounting system. The extrusions" of Figures 15 to 22 have many features in common with the extrusions of Figures 1 to 8. As a consequence, where applicable, like parts have been designated with like reference numerals preceded by the prefix 1.<br>
The recess 128 of the extrusion 122 is, for the reason which will be described hereinafter, of a different configuration to the recess 28.<br>
The extrusion 152 differs somewhat in configuration from the extrusion 52. The single rib 54 is replaced by a series of ribs 154.1, 154.2 and 154.3. This enables :he extrusion 152 to be interengaged with the upper extrusion 110 in three different<br><br>
positions instead of in a single position.<br>
The recess 128.1 differs in configuration to the recess 28.1 for the same reason that the recesses 28 and 128 differ from one another.<br>
The extrusion 162 of Figures 23 and 24 is of a synthetic plastics material, or a rubber compound, which will weid to the panel 156 (Figures 25 and 26). it comprises a bead 164 the shape of which matches that of the recesses 128, 128.1. It also comprises a strip-like portion 166 which is thin in section, as compared to the bead 164, and it is these portions which are welded along the edges of the panel 156 (see particularly Figures 25 and 26).<br>
The panel 156 is mounted on the upper and lower extrusions 152 and 122 by feeding the beads 164 of the extrusions 162 which are welded to the upper and lower edges of the panel through the recesses 128 and 128.1 from the ends of the recesses. An appropriate one of the ribs 154.1, 154.2 and 154.3 is engaged with the recess 120 of the upper extrusion 110. Thereafter the procedure for mounting the , panel 156 is the same as the procedure for mounting the panel 56.<br>
The procedure followed to remove the panel 156 is the same as that<br>
followed to remove the panel 56 except in that the beads 164 cannot simply be lifted<br>
from the recess 128 and 128.1 but must be withdrawn by sliding them along the recesses.<br><br>
