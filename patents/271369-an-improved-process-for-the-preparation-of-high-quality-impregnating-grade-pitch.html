				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high quality impregnating grade pitch. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of coal tar pitch having low contents of quinoline insolubles (Ql) and toluene insolubles (Tl) and high content of coking value. It is used for densification of carbon-carbon composites made in various forms as aircraft brakes, nose cones, heat shields, high temperature dies, bone plates and hip joints etc. The same pitch can also be used to impregnate the graphite electrodes for use in steel industry.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The commercially available coal tars are obtained from the destructive distillation of metallurgical coals by the steel industry. The coal tars, so obtained, invariably contain soot-like fine particles formed by the thermal cracking of tar vapours and entrained fine particles of coal and coke. Since coal tar pitches are residues obtained in the distillation of such coal tars, these very Ql particles are also found in these pitches. The commercially available coal tars and coal tar pitches normally contain Ql in range of 4-15% which make them unsuitable for the impregnation purpose.<br>
In the prior art, three methods employing, separately, filtration, solvent extraction and centrifugation are known for removing Ql from coal tars and coal tar pitches. The filtration method involves the filtration of molten coal tar precursor heated to about 250°C through filters of various types to get low Ql tar or pitch. The method of solvent extraction, on the other hand employs the use of solvents to extract the solvent-soluble portion of coal tars or coal tar pitches which are low in Ql. The solvent is then removed from the soluble portion by the conventional distillation technique. The centrifugation method involves the removal of Ql from the molten coal tar precursor using industrial centrifugal machines. These known processes for the removal of Ql have certain drawbacks which make them cumbersome as well as expensive. To obviate the above mentioned drawbacks, we in our earlier patent No. 186256 (2002) have provided the process for the<br>
producing the low QI/QI free impregnating pitches which have been obtained by heat treating commercial coal tar pitches with the mixture of special industrial solvents to cause coagulation of Ql particles as Ql mass in the pitch solvent mixtures. The major pitch solvent portion containing no or low Ql can be distilled to remove the solvent and obtain the impregnating pitch.<br>
The characteristics of low Ql / Ql-free impregnating grade coal tar pitch obtainable with the above processes are<br>
Softening point	80 - 120°C<br>
Quinoline insoluble	0.0 - 3.0%<br>
Toluene insoluble	16-24%<br>
Coking value	42 - 46 %<br>
Specific gravity	1.26 - 1.28<br>
Ash content	0.05 % (Max.)<br>
All the methods mentioned above produce impregnating grade of pitches of low coking value (42-46%) besides having low contents of Ql (0-3%) . Therefore, a large number of impregnations followed by carbonization cycles are required to improve the bulk density of the carbon-carbon composites and graphite electrodes. As a result, the process of producing carbon-carbon composites and graphite electrodes through large number of impregnation and carbonization cycles is tedious, cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of impregnating grade pitch with a high content of coking value (50-65%).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of impregnating grade pitch, which is useful for making carbon-carbon composites, graphite electrodes etc.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
the preparation of impregnating grade pitch , which possesses Ql in the range of 0-3%.<br>

In still another embodiment the high quality coal tar pitch obtained has high coking value of 50-65% and low quinoline-insoluble contents of 0-3%.<br>
Detail description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel impregnating grade pitch which is useful for making carbon-carbon composites, graphite electrodes and the like, which comprises<br>
(i) Heating of a commercial coal tar pitch or a mixture of commercial coal tar pitch and petroleum pitch at a temperature in the range of 300-450 °C in inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure to obtain a pitch of high softening point (150 - 350°C) and with higher value of Ql (5-50%), Tl (30-70%) and coking value (70-80%).<br>
(ii) Heating the resulting pitch in the presence of suitable inexpensive aromatic solvent, such as tar oil, wash oil, toluene, etc respectively, in requisite proportions, at a temperature around 80-170°C, to cause the dissolution of the pitch in the solvent.<br>
(iii) The Ql containing mass is then separated from the pitch-solvent mixture by a simple separating device or a decantation process or a filtration process, (iv) The pitch-solvents mixture is then distilled at temperatures upto 360°C to recover the solvents in inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure and obtain the novel impregnating-grade pitch.<br>
The novel feature of the present invention are the use of the precursor pitch material obtained by heat-treatment of a coal tar pitch or mixture of coal tar pitch and petroleum pitch which is then treated with a suitable aromatic solvent to extract the solvent soluble portion low in Ql or free of Ql which is then distilled to remove the solvent and obtain the high quality impregnating grade coal tar pitch.<br>

The pitch possess a SP of 120°C, Ql of 1.2%, Tl of 7.5%, CV of 63.3% and SG of 1.28.<br>
Example 2<br>
The above experiment is repeated and heat treated pitch is dissolved in a commercial inexpensive industrial solvent toluene and the solvent soluble portion is distilled to get pitch of SP of 115°C, Ql of 2.2%, Tl of 23.2% and CV of 62.2%.<br>
Example 3<br>
A commercial low Ql coal tar pitch is heat treated upto 430°C under a reduced pressure of 12 cm to produce a pitch of S.P. of 213°C, Ql of 22%, Tl of 58.6, CV of 75.8% and S.G. of 1.34. The resulting pitch is heat treated in presence of coal tar oil (1:6) and soluble portion is distilled to recover the solvent and obtain the impregnating pitch. The final pitch possesses a S.P. of 83°C, Ql of 0.2%, Tl of 3.7% and CV of 52.6%.<br>
Example 4<br>
A commercial low Ql coal tar pitch is heat treated upto 380°C for 1.25 hrs under partial vacuum of 4 cm Hg to produce a pitch of S.P. of 192°C, Ql of 5.6%, Tl of 60.8, CV of 68% and S.G. of 1.33. The resulting pitch is heat treated with toluene and the solvent portion is distilled to recover the solvent and obtain the<br>
impregnating pitch possess a SP of 81 °C, Ql of 1.3%, Tl of 4.4% and CV of 54.3% and SG of 1.29.<br>
Example 5<br>
A low Ql coal tar pitches is heated upto 380°C for 1.25hr under reduced pressure to obtain a pitch of softening point of more than 300°C, Ql of 15.2%, Tl of 66.8% and CV of 78.8%. The treated pitch is heated in presence of coal tar oil and soluble portion is distilled to recover the solvent and obtain impregnating pitch with a yield of 36%. The pitch possesses a SP of 87°C, Ql of 0.1%, Tl of 3.5%, CV of 53.4% and SG of 1.27.<br>
Example 6<br>
A low Ql coal tar pitch is heated upto 405°C for 15min under reduced pressure (4 cm Hg) to obtain a pitch of softening point of more than 210°C, Ql of 15%, Tl of 57.5% and CV of 73.5% and SG of 1.33. The treated pitch is heated in presence of suitable solvent and soluble portion is distilled to recover the solvent and obtain impregnating pitch. The pitch possesses a SP of 120°C, Ql of 0.9%, Tl of 7.6%, CV of 58.2% and SG of 1.29.<br>
Advantages:<br>
The main advantage of the present invention is the simplicity of the process coupled with the enhanced efficient impregnation of the special pitch to obtain dense carbon-carbon composite and graphite electrodes with fewer impregnation cycles. Besides this, as mentioned already, this process can also lead to a variety of other pitches suitable for several other applications.<br><br><br><br><br>
