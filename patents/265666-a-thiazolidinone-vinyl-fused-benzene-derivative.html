				<td>Azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This present invention is related to the use of azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives of formula (I) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or viral infections, kidney diseases, platelet aggregation, cancer, graft rejection or lung injuries. Specifically, the present invention is related to substituted azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives for the modulation, notably the inhibition of the activity or function of the phospho-inositide-3'OH kinase family, PI3K, particularly of the PI3Ky.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Cellular plasma membranes can be viewed as a large store of second messenger that can be enlisted in a variety of signal transduction pathways. As regards function and regulation of effector enzymes in phospholipid signalling pathways, these enzymes generate second messengers from the membrane phospholipid pool (class I PI3 kinases (e.g. PI3Kgamma)) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, means they display both: lipid kinase (phosphorylation of phospho-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, shown to be capable of phosphorylation of other protein substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intramolecular regulatory mechanism. These enzymes of phospholipid signalling are activated in response to a variety of extra-cellular signals such as growth factors, mitogens, integrins (cell-cell interactions) hormones, cytokines, viruses and neurotransmitters such as described in Scheme 1 hereinafter and also by intra-cellular cross regulation by other signaling molecules (cross-talk, where the original signal can activate some parallel<br>
pathways that in a second step transmit signals to PI3Ks by intra-cellular signaling events),<br>
such as small GTPases, kinases or phosphatases for example.<br>
The inositol phospholipids (phosphoinositides) intracellular signalling pathway begins with<br>
binding of a signalling molecule (extracellular ligands, stimuli, receptor dimerization,<br>
transactivation by heterologous receptor (e.g. receptor tyrosine kinase)) to a G-protein<br>
linked transmembrane receptor integrated into the plasma membrane.<br>
PI3K converts the membrane phospholipid PIP(4,5)2 into PIP(3,4,5)3 which in turn can be<br>
further converted into another 3' phosphorylated form of phosphoinositides by 5'-specific<br>
phospho-inositide phosphatases, thus PI3K enzymatic activity results either directly or<br>
indirectly in the generation of two 3'-phosphoinositide subtypes that function as 2nd<br>
messengers in intra-cellular signal transduction {Trends Biochem Sci. 22(7) p.267-72<br>
(1997) byj/anhaesebroeck B et al., Chem Rev. 101(8) p.2365-80 (2001) by Leslie N.R et al<br>
(2001); Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 17 p.615-75 (2001) by Kafsb R. et al. and Cell Mol Life<br>
Sci. 59(5) p.761-79 (2002) by Toker a. et al.). Multiple PI3K isoforms categorized by their<br>
catalytic subunits, their regulation by corresponding regulatory subunits, expression<br>
patterns and signaling-specific functions (pi 10a, ß, δ, and ) perform this enzymatic<br>
reaction {Exp Cell Res. 25(1) p.239-54 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck B. and Annu Rev Cell<br>
Dev Biol. 17 p.615-75 (2001) by Katso R. et al).<br>
The evolutionary conserved isofonns p110 α and ß are ubiquitiously expressed, while 5 and y are more specifically expressed in the haematopoetic cell system, smooth muscle cells, myocytes and endothelial cells {Trends Biochem Sci. 22(7) p.267-12 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck B et al.). Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the cellular-, tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context. To date, eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified, divided into three main classes (I, II, and III) on the basis of sequence homology, structure, binding partners, mode of activation, and substrate preference in vitro. Class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate phosphatidyl inositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate, and<br>
phosphatidylinositol-3 ^^-triphosphate, respectively. Class II PDKs phosphorylate PI and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Class III PDKs can only phosphorylate PI {Trends Biochem Sci. 22(7) p.267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck B et al, Exp Cell Res. 25(1) p.239-54 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck B. and Chem Rev. 101(8) p.2365-80 (2001) by Leslie N.R et al (2001)) G-protein coupled receptors mediated phosphoinositide 3'OH-kinase activation via small GTPases such as Gß and Ras, and consequently PI3K signaling plays a central role in establishing and coordinating cell polarity and dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton - which together provides the driving force of cells to move.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
As above illustrated in Scheme 1, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in the phosphorylation of Phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns) on the third carbon of the inositol ring. The phosphorylation of Ptdlns to 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3)P act as second messengers for a variety of signal transduction pathways, including those essential to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell growth, cell size, cell survival, apoptosis, adhesion, cell motility, cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape changes, vesicle trafficking and metabolic pathway (Armu Rev Cell Dev Biol. 17 p.615-75 (2001) by Katso et al. and Mol Med Today 6(9) p.347-57 (2000) by Steiir C). Chemotaxis - the directed movement of cells toward a concentration gradient of chemical attractants, also called chemokines is involved in many important diseases such as inflammation/auto-immunity, neurodegeneration, angiogenesis, invasion/metastisis and wound healing (Immunol Today 21(6) p.260- 4(2000) by Wyman NP et al.; Science 287(5455) p.1049-53 (2000) by Hirscl et al.; FASEB J 15(11) p.2019-21 (2001) by Hirsch et al. and Nat Immunol. 2(2) p.108-15 (2001) by Gerard C. et al.).<br>
Recent advances using genetic approaches and pharmacological tools have provided insights into signaling and molecular pathways that mediate chemotaxis in response to chemoattractant activated G-protein coupled receptors PI3-Kinase, responsible for generating these phosphorylated signalling products, was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3'-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al., Trends Cell Biol. 2 p.3 5*5-60 (1992)). However, more recent biochemical studies revealed that, class I PI3 kinases (e.g. class IB isoform PDKv) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, means they display both: lipid kinase (phosphorylation of phospho-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, shown to be capable of phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intra-molecular regulatory mechanism.<br>
So, PI3-kinase activation, therefore, is believed to be involved in a range of cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Parker et al., Current Biology, 5 p.577-99 (1995), Yao et al., Science, 267 p.2003-05 (1995)). PI3-kinase appears to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-associated PI3-kinase activity has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important costimulatory molecule for the activation of T-cells in response to antigen (Pages et al., Nature, 369 p,327-29 (1994); Rudd, Immunity 4 p.527-34 (1996)). Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the treshold for activation by antogen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL2), an important T cell growth factor (Fraser et al., science, 251 p.313-16 (1991)). Mutation of CD28 such that it can longer interact with PI3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate IL2 production, suggesting a critical role for PI3-kinase in T cell activation.<br>
PI3K has been identified as a mediator of G beta-gamma-dependent regulation of JNK<br>
X activity, and G beta-gamma are subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (J. Biol. Chem. 273(5)<br>
p.2505-8 (1998). Cellular processes in which PI3Ks play an essential role include<br>
suppression of apoptosis, reorganization of the actin skeleton, cardiac myocyte growth,<br>
glycogen synthase stimulation by insulin, TNFα-mediated neutrophil priming and<br>
superoxide generation, and leukocyte migration and adhesion to endothelial cells.<br>
Recently, {Immunity 16(3) p.441-51 (2002)) it has been described that PI3Ky relays<br>
inflammatory signals through various G(i)-coupled receptors and its central to mast cell function, stimuli in context of leukocytes, immunology includes cytokines, chemokines, adenosines, antibodies, integrins, aggregation factors, growth factors, viruses or hormones for example {J.Cell Sci. 114(Pt 16) p.2903-10 (2001) by Lawlor MA et al., Imnruiiity 16(3) p.441-51 (2002) by Laffargue M. et al. and Curr.Opinion Cell Biol. 14(2) p.203-13 (2002) by Stephens L. et al.).<br>
Specific inhibitors against individual members of a family of enzymes provide invaluable tools for deciphering functions of each enzyme. Two compounds, LY294002 and<br>
wortmannin (cf.hereinafter), have been widely used as PI3-kinase inhibitors. These compounds are non-specific PI3K inhibitors, as they do not distinguish among the four members of Class I PI3-kinases. For example, the IC50 values of wortmannin against each of the various Class I PI3-kinases are in the range of 1-10 nM. Similarly, the IC50 values for LY294002 against each of these PI3-kinases is about 15-20 µM (Fruman et al., An. Rev. Biochem., 67 p.481-507 (1998)), also 5-10 microM on CK2 protein kinase and some inhibitory activity on phospholipases. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite which irreversibly inhibits PI3K activity by binding covalently to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin eliminates the subsequent cellular response to the extracellular factor. For example, neutrophils respond to the chemokine fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) by stimulating PI3K and synthesizing Ptdlns (3, 4, 5)Ps. This synthesis correlates with activation of the respirators burst involved in neutrophil destruction of invading microorganisms. Treatment of neutrophils with wortmannin prevents the fMLP-induced respiratory burst response (Thelen et al. PNAS 91 p.4960-64 (1994)). Indeed, these experiments with wortmannin, as well as other experimental evidence, shows that PI3K activity in cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, and other types of leukocytes, is involved in many of the non-memory immune response associated with acute and chronic inflammation.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Based on studies using wortmannin, there is evidence that PI3-kinase function also is required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (Thelen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA, 91 p.4960-64 (1994)). Morever, it has been shown that wortmannin and LY294002 block neutrophil migration and superoxide release. However, in as much as these compounds do not distinguish among the various isoforms of PI3K, it remains unclear which particular PI3K isoform or isoforms are involved in these phenomena.<br>
Azolidinone-vinyl benzene derivatives - having a mandatory benzimidazole moiety though - are described in WO 02/051409. The compounds are said to inhibit telomerase and are purportedly useful in the treatment of cancer.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein A, X, Y, Z, n, R and R" are described in details in the description hereinafter, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or viral infections, kidney diseases, platelet aggregation, cancer, transplantation complications, graft rejection or lung injuries. Compounds of this invention are inhibitors<br>
of Phosphato-inositides 3-kinases (PI3Ks), particularly of Phosphatoinositides 3-kinases gamma (PI3K).<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
It has now been found that compounds of the present invention are modulators of the Phosphatoinositides 3-kinases (PI3Ks), particularly of Phosphatoinositides 3-kinase y (PI3K). When the phosphatoinositides 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme is inhibited by the compounds of the present invention, PI3K is unable to exert its enzymatic, biological and/or pharmacological effects. The compounds of the present invention are therefore useful in the treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders and/or inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or viral infections, kidney diseases, platelet aggregation, cancer, transplantation complications, graft rejection or lung injuries.<br>

The azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives exemplified in this invention may be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred experimental conditions (i.e. reaction temperatures, time, moles of reagents, solvents etc.) are given, other experimental conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can be determined by the person skilled in the art, using routine optimisation procedures.<br>
In the process illustrated in the following schemes R1, R2, G, V, W, Y1, Y2, Z, m, n, o, p and q are each as above-defined in the description.<br>
Generally, the azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives according to the general formula (I) could be obtained by several synthetic approaches, using both solution-phase<br>
and solid-phase chemistry protocols (Brummond et al., J.O.C., 64,1723-1726 (1999)), either by conventional methods or by microwave-assisted techniques.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In a first step, approximately equimolar amounts of the aldehyde reactant P1 (P1a) and compound 2 (in particular thiazolidinedione or rhodanin P3) are heated in the presence of a preferably mild base to provide the corresponding olefin of formula (Ia). In the first step, P1a may be replaced by precursors P1b and P1c in order to obtain the final compounds (Ib) and (Ic) respectively as above described in the description.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Particularly preferred process according to the invention are illustrated by the following schemes 3 and 4 in which compounds of formula (II) and (HI) respectively, may be obtained using the same reaction as above-mentioned.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
While this step may be carried out in the absence of a solvent at a temperature, which is sufficiently high to cause at least partial melting of the reaction mixture, it is preferably carried out in the presence of a inert solvent. A preferred temperature range is from about 100°C to 250°C, and especially preferred is a temperature of from about 120°C to 200°C. Examples of such solvents for the above reaction include solvents like dimethoxymethane, xylene, toluene, o-dichlorobenzene etc. Examples of suitable mild bases for the above reaction are alkali metal and alkaline earth salts of week acids such as the (C1-C12)-alkyl<br>
carboxylic acids and benzoic acid, alkali metal and alkaline earth carbonates and bicarbonates such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and secondary amines such as piperidine, morpholine as well as tertiary amines such as pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, N-methylpiperidine and the like. Especially preferred mild bases are sodium acetate or piperidine for reasons of economy and efficiency.<br>
In atypical such reaction (Tietze et.al., in "The Knoevenagel reaction", p.341 ff., Pergamon Press, Oxford 1991, Eds.: Trost B.M., Fleming I.) the aldehyde starting material P1 a and the other starting compound (e.g. thiazolidinedione) P3 are combined in approximately equimolar amounts with 0.5 to one equivalent of piperidine in dimethoxymethane or similar solvent and heated between 120 and 200°C at which the reaction is substantially complete in from about 15 minutes to 3 hours. The desired olefin of formula (Ia) is then isolated by filtration, in case it precipitated out of the reaction mixture upon cooling, or for example, by mixing with water and subsequent filtration, to obtain the crude product, which is purified, if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods.<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula (Ia) may be obtained typically by mixing equimolar amounts of thiazolidinedione P3 with aldheyde Pla and molar excess, preferably a 2-4 fold excess, of anhydrous sodium acetate and the mixture is heated at a temperature high enough to effect melting, at which temperature the reaction is mainly complete in from 5 to 60 minutes.<br>
Preferably the above reaction is earned out in acidic media such as acetic acid in the presence of sodium acetate or beta-alanine.<br>
Above described reactions may be carried out alternatively under microwave conditions as heating source. Typically the aldehyde starting material Pla and thiazolidinedione P3 are combined in approximately equimolar amounts with 0.5 to one equivalent of piperidine in<br>
dimethoxymethane or similar solvent and heated between 140°C and 240°C at which the reaction is substantially complete in from 3 to 10 minutes.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts of compounds of the present invention are readily prepared by reacting the acid forms with an appropriate base, usually one equivalent, in a co-solvent. Typical bases are sodium hxdroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, potassium methoxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, benzathine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, benethamine, diethylamine, piperazine and tromethamine. The salt is isolated by concentration to dryness or by addition of a non-solvent. In some cases, salts can be prepared by mixing a solution of the acid with a solution of the cation (sodium ethylhexanoate, magnesium oleate), employing a solvent in which the desired cationic salt precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and addition of a non-solvent.<br>
2,4-Azolidinone derivatives P3 are commercially available from various sources. The aldehydes of formula P la are prepared by a variety of well known methods, for example starting from the corresponding carboxylic acid alkyl ester or carboxylic acid by oxido-reduction, using standard techniques to reduce carboxylic acid alkyl ester or carboxylic acid to benzylic alcohols with lithium aluminium hydride, diisopropylaluminum etc. and ultimately re-oxidize the corresponding benzylic alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde by mild oxidation with reagents such as manganese dioxide, chromic acid, Dess-Martin reagent or Swern oxidation, or under conditions known to produce aldehydes from primary alcohols. An alternative way may be the direct reduction of the corresponding carboxylic acid alkyl ester or carboxylic acid to the corresponding aldehyde, using DIBAL at low temperature or any other techniques known in the field.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
An alternative way to prepare the appropriate aldehydes is the selective reduction of a<br>
nitrile moiety to the corresponding aldehyde using known methods like e.g. DIBAL etc.<br>
Another way to access aldehydes of formula Pla is the selective reduction of the	.<br>
corresponding acyl chloride using e.g. Lithiumaluminium-tri-tert-butoxyhydride (Cha J.S., Brown H.C., J.O.C 1993, 58, p.4732-34). Another alternative way to produce the appropriate aldehydes is the reaction of the corresponding benzene derivative in a Friedl-Crafts type of reaction wherein the substrate P4 as shown in the above scheme 5 is reacted with 1,1-dichloromethylmethyl ether in the presence of a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride or aluminium trichloride or any corresponding Lewis acids suitable for such type of reaction.<br>
Acccording to a more particularly preferred process of the invention, as described in the literature (Petrov O.I., Kalcheva V.B., Antonova A.T., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 62, p.494-7 (1997)) and illustrated by Scheme 6 hereinafter, reactant P2 may be obtained starting from P5 by reacting with 1,1-dichloromethylmethyl ether as above-described.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Acccording to another more particularly preferred process of the invention, as illustrated by Scheme 7 hereinafter, reactant P6 may be obtained starting from P7 by reacting with DMF and the presence of magnesium or 71-butyl- lithium or any other method known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Acccording to another more particularly preferred process of the invention, as illustrated by Scheme 8 hereinafter, reactant P6 may be obtained starting from P9 by reacting n-butyllithium or LDA in the presence of an appropriate electrophile R1-X, or any other method known to the person skilled in the art. This method may be repeated for P8 in order to obtain P6 accordingly.<br>
Scheme 8<br>

Similarily, saturated precursors P6 may be obtained in a one-pot reaction using P9 and appropriate electrophiles R1-X and R2-X as set out in Scheme 9.<br>

If the above set out general synthetic methods are not applicable to obtain compounds according to formula (I) and/or to necessary intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of formula (I) will depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of of the present invention which contain a basic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solu-tion of compound of the present invention with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.<br>

The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and intranasal. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes<br>
of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the thiazolidinedione-vinyl fused-benzene derivative is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.<br>
Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatine; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.<br>
Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As above mentioned, the thiazolidinedione-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives of formula (I) in such compositions is typically a minor component, frequently ranging between 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.<br>
The above described components for orally administered or injectable compositions are merely representative. Further materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set out in Part 5 of Remington's Phannaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition, 2000, Marck Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be administered in sustained release fonns or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can also be found in the incorporated materials in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>

Intermediate 1: Preparation of 5-formyl-1-benzofuran<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Step I Ethyl-2-formyl-4-bromophenoxy acetate:<br>
A mixture of 5-bromosaiicylaldehyde (50g, 0.248mol), ethylbromoacetate (42g, 0.248mol) and K2CO3 (68g, 0.49mol) in dry DMF (200mL) was stirred at RT for 12h. The reaction mixture was filtered and filtrate diluted with water. The mixture was extracted with diethylether (4x200mL), washed with brine and concentrated to give crude ethyl-2-formyl-4-bromophenoxy acetate (64g, 90%) as a solid.<br>
Step II: 4-Bromo-2-formylphenoxy acetic acid:<br>
A mixture of ethyl-2-formyl-4-bromophenoxy acetate (60g, 0.209mol), LiOH (7.5g, 0.31mol), THF (250mL) and water (lOOmL) was stirred at RT for 24h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduce pressure and residue acidified with 1.5N HC1 to pH=2. The solid precipitate obtained was filtered and dried to give 4-bromo-2-formylphenoxy acetic acid (50g, 94%).<br>
Step III: 5-Bromo-l-benzofuran:<br>
To a mixture of 2-formyl-4-bromophenoxy acetic acid (50g, 0.192mol), sodium acetate (100g, 1.21mol) in acetic acid (250mL) at 100°C was added acetic anhydride (lOOmL) portions during a period of 3h. The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 20h. The solvent was removed by distillation and residue diluted with 3N HC1 (500mL) and refluxed for 2h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under vacuum and product extracted with pet.<br>
ether (3x200mL). The organic layer was washed with 10% NaHCO3 solution and evaporated to give 5-bromo-l-benzofuran (15g, 40%) as a pale yellow liquid.<br>
Step IV: 5-Formyl-l-benzofuran (Pla in scheme 2 for example 9):<br>
A mixture of 5-bromo-l-benzofuran (0.5g), Mg (0.92g, 0.038mol), I2 (1 crystal) in dry THF (2.5mL) under N2 atmosphere was refluxed for 30min. To this was added a solution of 5-bromo-1-benzofiiran (4.5g) in 25mL of dry THF) as soon as the I2 color disappear and refluxed for another 2h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to -40°C and added dry DMF (3.6g) drop-wise and slowly warmed to RT for a period of 12h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0°C and acidified with 3N HC1 to pH=2 and stirred for 30min.

Example 114: Biological assays<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be subjected to the following assays:<br>
a) High Throughput PI3K lipid kinase assay (binding assay):<br>
The assay combines the scintillation proximity assay technology (SPA, Amersham) with the capacity of neomycin (a polycationic antibiotic) to bind phospholipids with high<br>
affinity and specificity. The Scintillation Proximity Assay is based on the properties of weakly emitting isotopes (such as 3H, 1251,33P). Coating SPA beads with neomycin allows the detection of phosphorylated lipid substrates after incubation with recombinant PI3K and radioactive ATP in the same well, by capturing the radioactive phospholipids to the SPA beads through their specific binding to neomycin.<br>
To a 384 wells MTP containing 5 ul of the test compound of formula (I) (solubilized in 6% DMSO; to yield a concentration of 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.001 uM of the test compound), the following assay components are added. 1) δ µl (58 ng) of Human recombinant GST-PDK (in Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4, DTT 1 mM and ethylenglycol 5%) 2) 10 µl of lipid micelles and 3) 10 µl of Kinase buffer ([33P]-ATP 45uM/60nCi, MgCl2 30mM, DTT ImM, ß-Glycerophosphate lmM,Na3VO4 100 µM, Na Cholate 0.3 %, in Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4). After incubation at room temperature for 180 minutes, with gentle agitation, the reaction is stopped by addition of 60 µl of a solution containing 100 µg of neomycin-coated PVT SPA beads in PBS containing ATP 10mM and EDTA 5mM. The assay is further incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes with gentle agitation to allow binding of phospholipids to neomycin-SPA beads. After precipitation of the neomycin-coated PVT SPA beads for 5 minutes at 1500 x g, radioactive PtdIns(3)P is quantified by scintillation counting in a Wallac MicroBeta ™ plate counter.<br>
The values indicated in respect of PI3K y refer to the IC50 (µM), i.e. the amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of said target. Said values show a considerable potency of the azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene compounds with regard to PI3K.<br>
The tested compounds according to formula (I) display an inhibition (IC50) with regard to PI3K of less than 2 µM, more preferred equal or less than 1 µM.<br>
Examples of inhibitory activities for test compounds 41, 61, 66, 73, 103, 107 and 110 as set out in Table 1.<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>

b) Cell based ELISA to monitor PI3K inhibition:<br>
Measurement of Akt/PKB phosphorylation in macrophages after stimulation with C5a: Raw 264: Raw 264-7 macrophages (cultured in DMEM-F12 medium containing 10% Fetal Calf serum and antibiotics) are plated at 20'000 cells/well in a 96 MTP 24 h before cell stimulation. Previous to the stimulation with 50 nM of Complement 5a (C5a; which is a well known chemokine which stimulates the used cells) during 5 minutes, Cells are serum starved for 2h, and pretreated with inhibitors for 20 minutes. After stimulation cells are fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes and washed 3 times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton). Endogenous peroxidase is blocked by a 20 minutes incubation in 0.6% H2O2 and 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS/Triton and washed 3 times in PBS/Triton. Cells are then blocked by 60 minutes incubation with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS/Triton. Next, phosphorylated Akt/PKB is detected by an overnight incubation at 4°C with first antibody (anti phospho Serine 473 Akt IHC, Cell Signaling) diluted 800-fold in PBS/Triton, containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 3 washes in PBS/Triton, cells are incubated for 60 minutes with a peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1/400 dilution in PBS/Triton, containing 5% BSA), washed 3 times in PBS/Triton, and 2 times in PBS and further incubated in 100 µl of substrate reagent solution (R&amp;D) for 20 minutes.<br>
The reaction is stopped by addition of 50 µl of 1 M H2SO4 and absorbance is read at 450 nm.<br>
The values indicated reflect the percentage of inhibition of AKT phoshorylation as compared to basal level. Said values show a clear effect of the azolidinone-vinyl fused-benzene compounds on the activation of AKT phosphorylation in macrophages.<br>
Compounds of examples 1, 19, 66 and 107, when used at 10µM completely (about 100%) inhibit C5a-mediated AKT phosophorylation. Examples 17, 19 or 73, when used at 1 µM, inhibit 95% of the C5a-mediated AKT-phosphorylation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
