THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to sorting machine.<br>
Background of the invention: Introduction:<br>
Harvested crops are often cleaned before they are offered for sale in the markets. Especially in case of fruits, they are not only cleaned but also sorted according to their grades. After the process of sorting is complete the fruits are packed in boxes. The sorting process is very important, as it is necessary that fruits of the same grade be packed together. Such sorted packed boxes are sent to the local and international markets for sale.<br>
In accordance with the standards of the international markets it is necessary that the error rate in the process of sorting be maintained below a certain prescribed limit. The process of sorting is usually a manual, time consuming, laborious process. Hence there was need to provide an apparatus, which automatically sorts fruits according to their grades.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
US Patent No. 5806686 illustrates a unique mechanical method and device for sorting pieces (e.g. vegetables and fruits) of any desired size from unsorted and irregularly sized pieces. The device includes a pair of elongated cylindrical brushes, one of which is equipped with a spiraled furrow for propelling the unsorted pieces and another brush being a smooth surfaced bristled brush (an expelling brush) laterally positioned to the propelling brush so as to form a trough between the two brushes for longitudinally moving the pieces. However this device cannot be extended for sorting of cashew nuts. As<br>
2<br><br>
the size of the cashew nut is small this device cannot be efficiently used for sorting of cashew nuts.<br>
US Patent No. 6758342 illustrates a cereal grain sorting system includes a wind force sorting device, a rough sorting device and a roll sorting device. The wind force sorting device is operative for selectively sorting lightweight foreign materials from feedstock cereal grains. The rough sorting device is operative for selectively removing foreign materials having different diameters from the standard one from the feedstock cereal grains. The roll sorting device is operative for selectively removing foreign materials having different forms from the standard ones from the feedstock cereal grains having been subjected to the wind force sorting step as well as to the rough sorting step. The disclosed sorting device cannot be extended for sorting of cashew nuts, as this device will not be efficient for sorting the cashew nuts according to their grades.<br>
This invention seeks to overcome the limitations of the prior art.<br>

Detailed description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
The invention will now be explained with reference to Figures 1 to 11 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the sorting machine in accordance with this invention. The device comprises: at least one set of two longitudinally extending counter rotating sorting rollers spaced apart from each other. The machine has a plurality of sets of sorting rollers arranged in an array forming a bank of rollers (10). The bank of rollers (10) is inclined at an angle in the range of 7 degrees to 17 degrees with respect to the relative horizontal. A hopper (12) is adapted to receive batches of cashew nuts to be sorted. The hopper (12) cooperates with the sorting rollers in a manner such that the elements falling from the hopper (12) fall in between the set of rollers provided in the roller bank (10). The machine includes collecting means (14), which cooperates with the sorting rollers to receive elements. The collecting means (14) collecting means are pipes extending from bank (10) of sorting rollers.<br>
7<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates the front view of the roller bank in accordance with this invention. The roller bank (10) consists of at least one set of two longitudinally extending counter rotating sorting rollers (16) spaced apart from each other. The counter rotating sorting rollers (16) rotate in a direction away from each other on the operative top surface of sorting rollers (16). The sorting rollers (16) defining a space between them throughout their length. The sorting rollers (16) define an operative top end and an operative bottom end. Space between the sorting rollers (16) is narrower at the operative top end and broader at the operative bottom end. The sorting rollers (16) have a plurality of sections (18). The sorting rollers (16) are machined in a manner such that each section (18) has uniformly reducing diameters from the operative top end to the operative bottom end of the sorting rollers (16). The reducing diameter of the sorting rollers (16) is in the form of discrete steps. Alternate spaces between each set of sorting rollers (16) rotating in a direction towards each other on the operative top surface of the sorting rollers (16) is covered by a cap (20).<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an alternate view of the roller of the sorting machine. At least one roller is provided at the element falling end of the hopper (12).<br>
Typically, a set of two rollers, a big roller (22) and a small roller (24) are provided for separating the elements falling from the element falling end of the hopper (12). The rollers (22) and (24) are adapted to counter rotate. The counter rotating rollers (22) and (24) facilitates easier separation of elements and provide the separated elements to the sorting rollers (16).<br>
8<br><br>
Figure 4 and figure 5 illustrates a non-operational left hand side view and right hand ride view of the sorting machine respectively. The machine has driving means (26) adapted to drive the sorting rollers (16) and the rollers (22) and (24). The driving means (26) is at least one selected from a group of driving means consisting of a motor, handles, animal drawing means, hydraulic and wind operated. The driving means (26) include speed varying elements which are at least one selected from a group of speed varying elements consisting of belt drive (27), drive shaft, gear, pulley and reduction gear box. Typically, the driving means used is a 1440 rpm induction motor with a reduction gearbox to reduce the speed of rotation at least by one third.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the bank of rollers in accordance with this invention. Cylindrical sections (18) of varying diameters are secured over the main shaft (28). The rollers (16) are counter rotating. The space between the sorting rollers (16), which rotate away from each other on the operative top surface is covered by cap (20) so that the elements to be sorted are not crushed. Figure 7, 8 and 9 illustrate the different types of rollers that are provided in the roller bank. The rollers in figure 7 are two cylindrical rollers (16), which are placed at an angle from each other. The rollers in figure 8 are two cylindrical rollers tapering at the operative bottom end of the sorting rollers (16). The rollers in figure 9 comprise a main shaft over which sleeves of varying sizes are separately secured to the main shaft (28). The rollers of the set of rollers are counter rotating. The space between the rollers is narrower at the operative top end and broader at the operative bottom end of the rollers. The sorting rollers (16) are made from a material which is at least one selected from a group of materials consisting of metal, synthetic polymeric material, nylon, rubber, glass, fiber,  Teflon, wood,  composite material and shell.  The reducing<br>
9<br><br>
diameter of the sections (18) of the sorting rollers (16) is in the form of discrete steps.<br>
The method in which the elements, typically cashew nuts are sorted can be explained in the following manner with the help of figure 10 and figure 11 of the accompanying drawings. The elements (30) fall from the hopper (12) onto the sorting rollers (16). Due to the presence of the cap (20) the elements (30) fall between the rollers, which are rotating away from each other on the operative top surface of the sorting rollers as seen in figure 10 and 11. Due to the rotation of the rollers the elements slide down the sorting rollers. The space between the sorting rollers is kept such that only a particular grade of elements to be pass through the space between the sorting rollers (16). The elements (30), which pass through the space are collected in containers (32), which are indicative of the grade of the elements, which are sorted.<br>
