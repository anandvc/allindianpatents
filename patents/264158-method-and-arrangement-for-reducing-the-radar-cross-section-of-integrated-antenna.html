				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to integrated antennas in general, specifically to methods and<br>
arrangements for the reduction of the radar cross section of such antennas.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
During the past few years, the concept of stealth technology has been successfully<br>
exploited, especially for aircrafts. In its most basic definition, stealth is the art of going un-<br>
noticed through an environment. The aim is therefore to make it increasingly difficult to<br>
detect an object by means of e.g. radar or other electromagnetic detection technique. A<br>
plurality of designs, materials, and electronic devices has therefore been developed for this<br>
purpose.<br>
Major potential sources of high radar visibility in stealth objects are antennas associated with<br>
the object. Since an antenna is typically designed to absorb energy in its operational band,<br>
the in-band diffraction is significant if the antenna is integrated in a non-absorbing<br>
environment. The out of band diffraction can also contribute to the so called radar cross<br>
section (RCS) if there is a phase difference between the reflection from the antenna and the<br>
reflection from the surroundings. Several phenomena have been identified as contributions<br>
to the radar visibility as represented by the radar cross section (RCS) of array antennas.<br>
These contributors can be divided according to: I) structural RCS, ii) antenna-mode RCS, i.e.<br>
reflections from inside the antenna, and iii) grating lobes i.e. above radio frequency (RF)<br>
band spikes. Examples of the various "classes" of contributors are e.g. grating lobes, edge<br>
diffraction, and surface waves<br>
The grating lobes can occur if the inter-element spacing is larger then half a wave length [[1,<br>
[2, [3].<br>
Edge diffraction can be interpreted as diffraction caused by the rapid change in the<br>
scattering properties between the antenna and its surroundings [[4]. The out of band<br>
diffraction can also contribute to the RCS if there is a phase difference between reflections<br>
from the antenna and reflections from the antenna surrounding.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for methods and arrangements to reduce the RCS of antennas.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>

Briefly, the present invention comprises providing a thin resistive sheet of a resistive material<br>
along the perimeter of an outer surface of an array antenna integrated in a surrounding<br>
material. The resistive sheet has a tapered resistivity distribution to provide a smooth<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention will be described in the context of but not limited to an array antenna<br>
integrated in a surface of a surrounding material, e.g. a perfectly electrical conductor<br>
surface. However, the same considerations are possible for other surrounding materials and<br>
for antennas with radome structures.<br>
4<br><br>
In order to fully comprehend the implications and various aspects of the present invention,<br>
some mathematical and theoretical considerations need to be explained.<br>
RCS and Physical optics approximation<br>
The basic definition of the Radar Cross Section (RCS) or a of an object is the ratio of the<br>
amplitude of the scattered power to the incident power in the direction of an observer at<br>
infinity. In other words, its equivalent area which if scattered isotropically would result in the<br>
same scattered power density [[5]. The RCS of an object can thereby be determined as the<br>
quotient between the amplitudes of the scattered wave and the incident wave, i.e.,<br><br>
where r is the position, k is the circular wave number, Es is the scattered wave and the<br>
incident wave Ei is a plane wave according to<br><br>
In general, the RCS of an object depends on the polarization and frequency of the incident<br>
wave. For two-dimensional objects, e.g., finite times infinite arrays, the RCS is the equivalent<br>
length of an object and given by<br><br>
where p is the reflection coefficient of the object.<br>
It is often convenient to use the logarithmic scale for the RCS. As the RCS is usually given in<br>
square meters or meters, this gives the units dBsm and dBm.<br>
For the case of scattering from an antenna integrated in the surface of e.g. a PEC object it is<br>
natural to consider the scattering of the antenna as the scattering of the object with the<br>
antenna minus the scattering of the object when the antenna is replaced with PEC. The<br>
5<br><br>
scattered field can be determined by integration of the currents on the surface of the object.<br>
Assume that the considered antenna array is planar and that is integrated in an infinite<br>
planar PEC surface. The current of the infinite PEC surface is given by J PEC = or<br>
equivalently by a reflection coefficient pPEC =-1. The total scattered field is obtained by<br>
integration of the electrical current J and magnetic current M on the surface.<br>
For the scattered field from the antenna it is necessary to subtract the current JPEC over the<br>
entire surface area. This gives the scattered field as a Fourier integral over the antenna<br>
aperture, i.e.<br><br>
where an equivalent model for an aperture in an infinite plane is used. The so called<br>
Physical Optics (PO) approximation gives a basic understanding of the scattering<br>
phenomena due to the geometry of the antenna aperture. The electrical current is<br>
approximated according to:<br><br>
where p(x) is the reflection coefficient of the antenna surface. Although the reflection<br>
coefficient is dyadic in general, it is sufficient to consider scalar reflection coefficients for the<br>
present analysis. The reflection coefficient depends on the spatial coordinate x, the<br>
frequency f, the direction k, and the polarization of the incident wave E,. This gives the PO<br>
approximation of the scattered field as<br><br>
where . The physical optics approximation of the RCS then yields:<br>
6<br><br><br>
Consequently, the mono-static RCS reduces to:<br><br>
Specular reflection and edge diffraction<br>
Consider the RCS of an antenna in the form of a square plate with side a and a reflection<br>
coefficient p in the PO approximation. Let the direction of an incident wave be given by<br>
  The mono-static RCS of the antenna is then<br>
calculated according to:<br><br>
Here, it is observed that the RCS is proportional to the contrast between the reflection<br>
coefficient in the antenna aperture and the surrounding material i.e. PEC. Moreover, the<br>
value of the RCS oscillates rapidly if ka &gt;&gt; 1 and takes its largest value in the specular<br>
direction θ = 0. Consequently, the edge diffracted field is strongest along the x and y axes,<br>
i.e. Φ= 0, 90°, 180°, 270°. Observe that PO is not very accurate for this diffracted field. The<br>
so-called Physical Theory of Diffraction (PTD) could be used to improve the accuracy.<br>
However, PO illustrates the basic phenomena and it is sufficient for this analysis. The RCS<br>
is smallest along the Φ = ±45, ±135°. This illustrates the importance to align objects such that<br>
the incident waves are reflected in other directions than backwards, i.e. away from the<br>
observer.<br>
Even though this example is very simple, it illustrates the basic phenomenon that has to be<br>
considered when designing an antenna array to provide a low (mono-static) RCS. First of all,<br>
it is necessary to orient the antenna array such that the specular reflection is directed in safe<br>
directions, i.e., away from the radar antenna. Second, it is important to reduce the amplitude<br>
7<br><br>
of the diffracted waves as much as possible. The alignment of the edges of the antenna can<br>
also be used to direct the diffracted waves away from the radar antenna.<br>
The specular reflection is in general no problem for an integrated antenna as it is directed in<br>
the same direction as the specular reflection of the body of the object, i.e., in a safe direction<br>
on a stealth object. Although the alignment can reduce degrading effect of the diffracted<br>
waves it is important to reduce their amplitude as it is difficult to avoid backscattered waves<br>
as well as multiple scattered waves in the mono-static direction.<br>
According to a general aspect of the present invention it is necessary to eliminate the<br>
discontinuity in the reflection coefficient at the edge of the antenna, in order to reduce the<br>
amplitude of the diffracted waves.<br>
Tapered resistive edge treatment is known to reduce edge diffraction and diffraction from<br>
impedance discontinuities [6, [4]. The resistive sheet is highly conductive σ and very thin<br>
d, and is such that σdR1, see e.g. [4, [7, [8]. Such sheets are used in radar absorbing<br>
materials (RAM) such as Salisbury screens and Jaunmann absorbers [4]. They have also<br>
been used to taper the edges of antennas to free space [1, [9]. Their scattering properties<br>
are analyzed in depth in [10, [11].<br>
A basic embodiment of the present invention comprises providing a transition zone with a<br>
tapered resistivity along the perimeter of an antenna array integrated in a surrounding<br>
material to provide a smooth transition of the scattering properties between the antenna and<br>
the surrounding material.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate two different views of an embodiment of an arrangement according to<br>
the invention. The arrangement includes a substantially flat antenna structure 10 integrated<br>
in a surface of a surrounding material 20. The antenna structure 10 is shown with but not<br>
limited to a rectangular shape. The invention is equally applicable to an arbitrarily shaped<br>
antenna.<br>
Further, the arrangement comprises a transition zone 30 provided in the form of a thin<br>
resistive sheet. This zone 30 is arranged along the outer perimeter of the antenna 10 and<br>
extends or overlaps a main outer surface 11 of the antenna 10, leaving a central section of<br>
the antenna 10 un-covered. Simply put, the transition zone 30 circumvents the antenna<br>
surface very much like a frame circumventing a painting. In the illustration of Figure 1 the<br>
8<br><br>
transition zone 30 extends a distance d over the antenna surface from an outer perimeter of<br>
the transition zone 30.<br>
In Fig. 2, the above described antenna structure is shown in a cross-section view, indicating<br>
the previously mentioned main outer surface 11 of the antenna 10 and the manner in which<br>
the transition zone 30 overlaps the antenna surface 11.<br>
Also indicated in the Figs. 1 and 2 are the reflection coefficients of the various components.<br>
However, the actual values of the respective coefficients are not limited to what is indicated<br>
in the Figs. 1 and 2 but can be varied within the inventive concept.<br>
In order to provide the requested smooth transition in the scattering properties across the<br>
interface between the surface of the surrounding material 20 and the main outer surface of<br>
the antenna 10 the transition zone 30 has a tapered resistivity profile. The resistivity of the<br>
transition zone varies with the distance d from the outer perimeter of the transition zone<br>
inwards over the antenna surface. According to a specific embodiment, the resistivity of the<br>
transition zone is dependent of the resistivity of the surrounding material and of the resistivity<br>
of the antenna main outer surface 11.<br>
Even though the above illustrations show the outer perimeter of the transition zone 30 as<br>
coinciding with the outer perimeter of the main surface 11 of the antenna, it is implied that<br>
the transition zone 30 can overlap the surrounding material 20 as well. For that case, the<br>
scattering properties of the transition zone overlapping the surrounding material matches the<br>
scattering properties of the surrounding material.<br>
Preferably, 'he transition zone extends continuously along the entire perimeter of the main<br>
surface 11. However, for some applications it might be beneficial or necessary to allow gaps<br>
or other irregularities in the transition zone. In addition, the transition zone 30 is illustrated as<br>
being of equal width d along the entire main surface 11. It is implied that also the width can<br>
vary depending on the application.<br>
The above-mentioned resistive sheet is preferably highly conductive σ and very thin d<br>
such that σ d = R1. Especially, suitable materials for the sheet is selected from a group<br>
commonly used in radar absorbing materials (RAM) such as Salisbury screens, conductive<br>
paint and conductive films. The materials are also found on metallic coating on so-called<br>
low-emittance windows.<br>
9<br><br>
The theoretics1 considerations for the provisions of the transition zone 30 in the form of a thin<br>
resistive sheet are described more in detail below.<br>
Thin conducting sheet<br>
As previously stated, in order to reduce the diffracted field of an antenna array it is<br>
necessary to provide a smooth transition of the scattering properties i.e. RCS over the<br>
interface between the antenna array and the surrounding material e.g. PEC.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the transition zone 30 is in the form of a thin<br>
resistive sheet (preferably metallic) with high conductivity, i.e. thickness d0 and<br>
conductivity p such that σd = R1 is finite, arranped on the outer main surface 11 of<br>
the antenna 10.<br>
The reflection coefficient of the sheet is, according to the invention, determined by (the<br>
derivation of the expression is shown in Appendix I):<br><br>
where R is resistivity of the sheet and TJT is the transverse wave impedance, i.e. ηr=ηo/cosθ<br>
and ηTM=η0COSθwhere θ is the incident angle. It is easily seen that pR is real valued and -1 
pR
The corresponding circuit model for the antenna and the transition zone is illustrated by Fig.<br>
3.<br>
For the specific embodiment of an antenna integrated in the surface of a PEC, let the<br>
resistance be zero i.e. equal to the resistance of the surrounding material e.g. PEC at the<br>
outer perimeter of the transition zone and increase to infinity i.e. air at distance d from the<br>
edge. The reflection coefficient of the combined sheet and antenna is given by<br><br>
10<br><br>
This represents a conformal map mapping -1 to 1. The unit circle is mapped into a circle<br>
centred at<br>
with radius <br>
A reflection coefficient follows the "inverted" reactive circles towards p' = -1 as R 0. See<br>
Fig. 4.<br>
The mono-static RCS for the arrangement is given by<br><br>
This expression is easily evaluated for any arbitrary transition zone PR(Τ) . The RCS can also<br>
be approximated as <br>
where p" is given by p + 1 convolved with a smooth function having unit area, i.e.,<br><br>
The convolved reflection coefficient follows a straight line from p to -1, see again Fig. 4. The<br>
two parts of the RCS are evaluated as<br><br>
11<br><br>
The first part can be made arbitrary small for a sufficiently large transition zone. The second<br>
part is given by the Fourier transform of the difference between the 'inverted' reactive circles<br>
and the straight lines. The worst case is given by p =+.<br>
To illustrate the effectiveness of the conducting sheet, consider an example with a piecewise<br>
constant, a linear, and cubic spline interpolation of the reflection coefficient, see Fig. 5a and<br>
the corresponding Fourier transform in Fig. 5b. Here it is seen that the resistive tapering<br>
reduces the RCS. There is no major difference between the three cases for low frequencies<br>
i.e. λ&gt;λ0 0.25*length of the transition zone. For higher frequencies the improvement is<br>
noticeable for the smooth transition.<br>
Numerical examples<br>
Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the reduction of the RCS two different array<br>
antennas. Consider the infinite times finite arrays. The infinite antenna array can be<br>
simulated in a known manner using either one of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method<br>
(FDTD), Method of Moments (MoM), or Finite Element Method (FEM) as long as the code<br>
can handle periodic boundary conditions [2, [12, [13]. Here, the code Periodic Boundary<br>
Finite-Difference Time-Domain method (PB-FDTD) developed by H. Holter [13] is used.<br>
Self-complementary patch array<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, consider an infinite antenna array<br>
comprising a plurality of PEC patches. The patches are fed at the corners of each patch<br>
giving a linear polarized field in the ±45° directions depending on the used feed points. The<br>
patch array is almost self complementary, i.e., the PEC structure is almost identical to its<br>
complement.<br>
Transformation zones according to the invention are provided on the outer main surfaces of<br>
the antenna array. The reflection coefficient of the antenna array varies according to Figure<br>
6a and Figure 6b. The dielectric sheets according to the invention act as a filter matching the<br>
antenna for a range of frequencies fl . f . fu. The upper frequency fu is limited by the onset of<br>
grating lobes and the destructive interference from a ground plane at half a wavelength<br>
distance. Hence, the ground-plane distance and the inter-element spacing are much smaller<br>
than the wavelength at the lower frequency fl. In analogy with quarter-wave transformers in<br>
broadband matching, the ground plane distance and the sheets are chosen to be of equal<br>
optical thickness, i.e., a sheet thickness of d/ is used [2, [3, [14]. The case with a<br>
single dielectric sheet is easily analyzed with a parametric study.<br>
12<br><br>
Here, we consider a patch array with dimensions a=9.6 mm, 6=0.8mm and h=13.6 mm<br>
giving the unit-cell length /0=20.8 mm. This gives a resonance frequency around 5.5GHz and<br>
the onset of grating lobes at 7.5GHz. Dielectric sheets with permittivity ε1=7 and ε2=3 are<br>
used. We consider an array consisting of 20 unit cells in the y direction, giving<br>
/=20/0=416mm, and an infinite amount of unit cells in the x-direction, i.e. periodic boundary<br>
conditions in the x-direction. As a plane wave in the yz-plane impinges on the array, it is<br>
convenient to use the polar angles 6 in the range <br>
The bi-static RCS of a self complementary patch array with a single dielectric sheet<br>
according to the above is illustrated graphically in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b. In this case the<br>
dielectric sheet can be designed to give one single loop in the centre of the Smith chart.<br>
Another way to plot the same information is illustrated in Fig. 8a and 8b, where the RCS is<br>
plotted as a function of the reflected angle. Both the results for a structure with the tapered<br>
transition zone according to the invention and without the transition zone are shown.<br>
As expected, the specular reflection at -60° dominates the bi-static RCS. The oscillations of<br>
the RCS away from the specular direction are due to the constructive and destructive<br>
interference of the edge diffracted waves. The oscillations are more rapid for large arrays.<br>
The envelope of the RCS is highlighted to emphasize the dependence of the size of the<br>
array. The mono-static RCS is approximately -20dBm at 3 GHz and -25dBm at 5 GHz for the<br>
integrated array without tapering. With a linear tapering over two unit cells, i.e. d = 2I0 42<br>
mm, the mono-static RCS reduces with approximately 20dBm.<br>
The resistive tapering reduces the RCS by smoothing out the discontinuity between the<br>
antenna and its surrounding material. However the RCS of an array can be significant if the<br>
array supports grating lobes. These grating lobes can occur if the inter element spacing in<br>
the array is larger than half a wave length. The path array supports grating lobes for<br>
frequencies above 7.5 GHz. The RCS of the self complementary 24 x oo array with a linear<br>
resistive tapering over the 2 edge elements for an illumination from 0=60° at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10<br>
GHz is shown in Fig. 6b. As seen in the figure the mono-static RCS is very small for<br>
frequencies up to the onset of grating lobes at 7.5 GHz. The beam width of the grating lobes<br>
as well as the specular lobe depends on the size of the array. The beam width decreases for<br>
larger arrays.<br>
13<br><br>
It is also possible, if not shown that the invention can be further amended to comprise a<br>
broadband dipole array with two dielectric sheets.<br>
Frequency selective radome (FSS)<br>
Also consider the RCS of a finite times infinite FFS radome provided on top of the antenna<br>
structure of the invention, see Fig. 9. Consider a symmetric hybrid radome with four legged<br>
loop element.<br>
The elements are arranged in a square grid with side length of l0 = 6.6 mm and they have a<br>
slot width of 0.17 mm. The loop elements are placed in a 3mm thick dielectric sheet with<br>
permittivity er = 1.6. This gives a bandpass structure with passband from 8.5 GHz to 9 GHz,<br>
see Fig. 10a. The radome is integrated into a PEC structure and an antenna is placed under<br>
the radome. The upper dielectric sheet is placed 5 mm from the inner side of the radome.<br>
For illustration purposes consider the three cases: without tapering, with a 26mm linear<br>
taper, and with a 53 mm linear taper. The radome size excluding the taper is 332mm x 1.<br>
The finite length corresponds to 50 unit cells. The bi-static RCS is shown in Figs. 10b, 10c,<br>
and 10d for a TE wave at 45° and the frequencies 6, 8.5, 11 GHz, respectively. The<br>
envelope of the RCS is highlighted to emphasize the amplitude of the edge diffracted part.<br>
As expected the specular reflection is largest in the passband, i.e., at 8.5 GHz, where the<br>
radome discontinuity between the radome and PEC is large. For frequencies outside the<br>
passband, the radome is highly reflecting and the discontinuity smaller. The effect of the<br>
tapering is negligible in the specular reflection.<br>
The mono-static RCS is also largest in the passband. Here, the effect of the tapering is<br>
considerable. As seen in Fig. 10c, the tapering reduces the mono-static RCS with 15 dBm to<br>
20 dBm. The mono-static RCS is also reduced outside the passband with the tapering;<br>
however the improvement is not as large as the original RCS is much smaller. In Figs. 11a-<br>
d, a comparison between the bi-static RCS calculated with FDTD and with the PO<br>
approximation is shown. The envelope of the FDTD and PO results are given by the solid<br>
and dashed curves, respectively. It is seen that the PO approximation gives a rough<br>
estimate of the RCS for the TE case, as illustrated by Fig. 11a.<br>
Surface waves<br>
With reference to Fig. 12, in order to improve the RCS of an antenna array according to the<br>
invention even further it is possible to reduce the degrading effect of surface waves. This can<br>
14<br><br>
be done by the use of an antenna array structure that does not support surface waves. It is<br>
according to a specific embodiment, possible to include a RAM into the antenna structure to<br>
reduce the degrading effect of surface waves. This is illustrated in Figure 12 by an antenna<br>
structure with an applied transition zone 30 and a RAM structure separating the antenna 10<br>
from the surrounding PEC-material 20 in the interface of the antenna and the surrounding<br>
PEC. The transition zone 20 is preferable adapted to extend over the RAM section as well.<br>
Numerical simulation indicate that the addition of the RAM section according to the invention<br>
absorbs part of the surface waves and reduces the RC3 at grazing angles as seen in Figs.<br>
13a and 13b.<br>
This invention enables reducing the mono-static radar cross section of an antenna array by<br>
providing a resistive sheet adjacent to the interface of the antenna array and the surrounding<br>
electrically conducting material e.g. perfectly electrical conductor (PEC).<br>
Specifically, the present invention shows that a tapered resistive sheet can transform the<br>
scattering properties of an antenna array to the scattering properties of a surrounding<br>
perfectly electrical conductor or PEC in a controlled way. The tapered resistive sheet<br>
transforms the reflection coefficient of the infinite antenna along the inverted reactive circles<br>
towards the -1 point as the resistivity decreases to zero.<br>
Specifically, applying the RCS in the physical optics (PO) approximation shows that the<br>
mono-static RCS reduces uniformly over a large frequency band, a wide angular scattering.<br>
Numerical results using FDTD of the RCS from dipole array, a self-complementary array and<br>
an FSS radome are also presented to illustrate the reduction of RCS.<br>
Advantages of the present invention include:<br>
Reduced mono-static RCS of antenna arrays.<br>
Transformation of the reflection coefficient of the antenna to that of the<br>
surrounding perfectly electrical conductor.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may<br>
be made to the present invention without departure from the scope thereof, which is defined<br>
by the appended claims.<br>
