BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention pertains to safety medical syringes and, in particular, to syringes<br>
including a needle that retracts and is limited to a single use.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Retractable syringes have become extremely increasingly important and desirable for<br>
use in hospitals and medical facilities for a number of reasons. In particular, retractable<br>
syringes are typically limited to a single use, where the hypodermic needle of the syringe is<br>
withdrawn into the syringe after aspiration and injection of a fluid, thus preventing multiple<br>
uses of the syringe and the potential transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as<br>
well as other diseases from patient-to-patient. The retraction of the needle within the syringe<br>
after use also shields the needle and prevents inadvertent needle jabs or pricks from occurring<br>
to patients and health care providers.<br>
A variety of different retractable syringe devices have been designed to effectively<br>
withdraw the needle within the syringe after use. However, the challenge exists to design a<br>
retractable syringe that is limited to a single use yet is simplistic in design and assembly, such<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
that the syringe can be produced on a large production scale while minimizing manufacturing<br>
costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a retractable syringe that is simple to<br>
use and is non-reusable.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a retractable syringe that is<br>
simple in design and inexpensive to manufacture.<br>
The aforesaid objects are achieved individually and in combination, and it is not<br>
intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be<br>
combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a syringe comprises a hollow barrel including an<br>
opening at a proximal end of the barrel, an opening at a distal end of the barrel and a fluid<br>
chamber disposed within the barrel, and a hollow plunger extending into the barrel via the<br>
proximal end opening and axially movable within the barrel toward and away from the distal<br>
end opening, where the plunger includes an end wall that is releasably secured to the plunger<br>
at an opening disposed at a distal end of the plunger and is moved from the plunger distal end<br>
opening during use of the syringe to facilitate access to a retraction cavity disposed within the<br>
plunger. The syringe further includes a needle assembly secured within and at a distal end of<br>
the barrel. The needle assembly includes a needle holder, a resilient member that biases the<br>
needle holder toward the proximal end opening of the barrel, and a retaining member<br>
releasably secured to the needle holder via a reduced material section, where the needle<br>
holder includes a connector to secure a needle to the needle holder so as to permit the needle<br>
to extend through the distal end opening of the barrel.<br>
The retaining member maintains the needle holder at the distal end of the barrel<br>
against the bias of the resilient member and, when the plunger is fully depressed within the<br>
barrel, the plunger is configured to engage the needle holder such that the end wall of the<br>
plunger is forced within the plunger and the retaining member is forced to break away and<br>
separate from the needle holder along the reduced material section to facilitate retraction of<br>
the end wall, the needle holder and a needle secured to the needle holder into the retraction<br>

WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
cavity.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the plunger end wall comprises a plug that frictionally<br>
engages with the plunger at the plunger distal end opening and, upon depression of the<br>
plunger toward the barrel distal end, the plug is configured to engage with the needle holder<br>
to dislodge the plug from the plunger and facilitate retraction of the plug, needle holder and<br>
needle secured to the needle holder into the retraction cavity.<br>
The above and still further objects, features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of a specific<br>
embodiment thereof, particularly when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
wherein like reference numerals in the various figures are utilized to designate like<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a medical syringe 20 includes a hollow cylindrical barrel 22 with<br>
an opening 23 at its proximal end, suitably dimensioned to receive a hollow plunger 30, and<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
an opening at its distal end to permit exposure of a needle 60 from the syringe. The barrel 22<br>
includes a main body portion 24 that receives and retains a portion of the plunger 30 and a<br>
distal end extension 26 of reduced internal diameter in relation to the main body portion 24<br>
that receives a needle assembly 56 as described below. The plunger 30 includes a resilient<br>
seal 32 encircling the plunger near its distal end. A fluid cavity 50 is defined within the barrel<br>
22 between the resilient seal 32 and other distal end portions of the plunger and a distal end<br>
25 of the barrel main body portion 24, where the fluid cavity varies in volume based upon<br>
axial displacements of the plunger with respect to the barrel. A sheath 68 is removably<br>
securable to the distal end of the barrel 22 to enclose a needle 60 secured within the barrel as<br>
described below prior to use of the syringe. The barrel, plunger, resilient seal, sheath and all<br>
other components of the syringe may be constructed of any suitable medical grade materials<br>
(e.g., plastics and/or stainless steels) that facilitate operability of the syringe as described<br>
below.<br>
The proximal end of plunger 30 includes a convex surface or domed thumb pad 38<br>
and a radially extending flange 39 that facilitates engagement with the fingers and/or thumb<br>
of the user during operation of the syringe. Similarly, the main body portion 24 of the barrel<br>
includes a radially extending flange 28 disposed near its proximal end for facilitating<br>
engagement with the fingers and/or thumb of the user during operation. An extended barrel<br>
portion 27 extends between flange 28 and the proximal end of the barrel and is slightly<br>
greater in internal diameter in comparison to the remainder of main body portion 24. The<br>
extended barrel portion 27 is also of a sufficient longitudinal dimension, and is slightly<br>
smaller in internal diameter than the transverse dimension of the plunger defined at the flange<br>
39, such that, when plunger 30 is fully depressed within the barrel, plunger flange 28 forces a<br>
slight flexure of the extended barrel portion 27 at the proximal end of the barrel to permit the<br>
flange to enter the extended barrel portion. Upon complete depression of the plunger within<br>
the barrel, the plunger flange 39 engages in a snap-tight locking relationship with an annular<br>
groove 29 disposed along the interior wall of the extended barrel portion near the proximal<br>
end of the barrel to prevent removal of the plunger from the barrel (as depicted in Fig. 6).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the distal end of plunger 30 is sealingly closed by an end wall 44,<br>
where the end wall is preferably molded as a part of the plunger. The end wall 44 includes an<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
annular notch or scored section 46 extending around a periphery of the end wall. The scored<br>
section 46 defines a thin membrane or reduced material section that is torn or broken away<br>
during depression of the plunger to facilitate access to a retraction cavity 48 of the plunger<br>
during use of the syringe as described below. The end wall 44 further includes a frusto-<br>
conical surface 45 that extends toward the distal end of the barrel and partially engages with a<br>
frusto-conical cavity portion 59 of the needle assembly 56 when the plunger is fully depressed<br>
into the barrel as described below. Alternatively, the end wall may be formed with any<br>
suitable outwardly or inwardly extending surface (e.g., conical, convex, V-shaped,<br>
multifaceted, etc.) or even a flat surface as desired for a particular application.<br>
The needle assembly 56 includes a needle holder or stem 58 that connects with a<br>
syringe needle 60 and is affixed within the distal end extension 26 of the barrel such that the<br>
needle 60 extends from the distal end of the barrel prior to and during use (as depicted in Fig.<br>
1). The needle stem 58 and needle 60 preferably releasably engage with each other (e.g., via<br>
a threaded engagement). An axially extending cavity 57 extends from a proximal end of the<br>
needle stem 58 to the connection point with the needle 60 in order to facilitate fluid<br>
communication between the needle and fluid cavity 50 within the barrel. In addition, cavity<br>
57 includes a widened portion 59 at the proximal end of needle stem 58 that is frusto-conical<br>
in configuration and widens toward the proximal end of the barrel so as to generally<br>
correspond with the frusto-conical surface 45 of the plunger 30. Specifically, the widened<br>
portion 59 is slightly offset from alignment with the central axis of the needle stem 58 (e.g.,<br>
by about 3-5°) and includes angled surfaces that are slightly different than the angled surfaces<br>
of the plunger end wall 44 such that, when the plunger is depressed toward the needle<br>
assembly, the frusto-conical plunger end wall surface 45 does not completely align and<br>
correspond with widened portion 59. The needle stem 58 further includes a radially<br>
extending flange 62 at its proximal end that is suitably dimensioned to engage with a step or<br>
ledge 21 disposed along an interior surface of the distal end extension 26 in order to prevent<br>
movement of the needle assembly distally beyond ledge 21 during depression of the plunger<br>
toward the distal end of the barrel.<br>
A disc-shaped stem ring 64 is secured to and extends radially from the flange 62 of<br>
needle stem 58 to engage with the interior wall surface of distal end extension 26 of the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
barrel. The stem ring 64 is preferably molded as a part of flange 62 and needle stem 58 and<br>
includes a notch or scored section 65 at the connection point of stem ring 64 and needle stem<br>
58. The scored section 65 defines a thin membrane or reduced material section that is torn or<br>
broken during operation of the syringe to facilitate retraction of needle assembly 56 in the<br>
manner described below. The stem ring 64 is preferably dimensioned to facilitate a partial<br>
sliding of a broken portion of the stem ring along the interior wall surface of the barrel when<br>
the plunger is depressed to engage with needle stem 58 as described below.<br>
The diameter of the stem ring can be selected to be slightly smaller, the same, or<br>
slightly larger than the diameter of the interior wall surface of distal end extension 26 at the<br>
location where the stem ring engages the barrel. In the embodiment depicted in Figs. 1-6, the<br>
diameter of stem ring 64 is slightly larger in comparison to the diameter of the interior wall<br>
surface of the barrel that engages with the stem ring such that the stem ring is slightly<br>
compressed during engagement with the barrel and forms an effective fluid tight seal. The<br>
dimensions of the stem ring are further selected to provide a compression fit/fluid tight seal at<br>
the stem ring/barrel interior wall interface while facilitating a sliding of the stem ring with the<br>
barrel interior wall surface when the plunger is completely depressed within the barrel.<br>
A radial protrusion or shoulder 66 is disposed along the interior surface and near the<br>
proximal, end of the distal end extension 26 of the barrel. The shoulder 66 engages with stem<br>
ring 64 to prevent movement of the needle assembly toward the proximal end of the barrel<br>
while the stem ring remains attached with needle stem 58. Alternatively, it is noted that a<br>
series of radially spaced protrusions can be provided to achieve the same result of engaging or<br>
locking the stem ring at the barrel distal end extension so as to prevent movement of the<br>
needle assembly toward the barrel proximal end while the stem ring is still attached to the<br>
needle stem. A resilient member 84 (e.g., a coil spring) is disposed between the flange 62 of<br>
needle stem 58 and an interior ledge 86 disposed on the interior surface of the distal end<br>
extension 26 at a location between the radial protrusion 64 and the distal end of the barrel.<br>
When the needle assembly 56 is press fit into the distal end extension 26 of the barrel (as<br>
described below) such that stem ring 64 is extended distally beyond the radial protrusion 66<br>
of the barrel, resilient member 84 is compressed to bias the needle assembly toward the<br>
proximal end of the barrel.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
The syringe 20 is designed so that complete depression of plunger 30 within barrel 22<br>
facilitates a combined tearing or breaking away of end wall 44 of the plunger and also a<br>
tearing or breaking away of the stem ring 64 from flange 62 of needle stem 58 to facilitate<br>
retraction of the needle stem and the needle 60 into the retraction cavity 48. in particular,<br>
plunger 30 includes an annular edge 78 at its distal end that is inclined at a slight angle (e.g.,<br>
about 3-5°) to a plane that is perpendicular to the central axis of the syringe. Similarly, the<br>
needle stem 58 includes an annular edge 80 at its proximal end that is inclined at a slight<br>
angle (e.g., about 3-5°) to a plane that is perpendicular to the central axis of the syringe.<br>
The plunger and the needle stem can be assembled within the syringe such that the<br>
apexes formed by their facing annular surfaces 78 and 80 are aligned at any selected<br>
orientation with each respect to each other. The specific orientation of the apexes of the<br>
plunger and needle stem with respect to each other within the syringe is not of particular<br>
importance to the function of the syringe. Thus, while Figs. 1-5 depict the apexes of annular<br>
surfaces 78 and 80 of the plunger and needle stem as being offset from each other by a<br>
rotational angle of about 180°, the apexes could also be substantially aligned with each other<br>
or offset by any other selected rotational angle (e.g., 45°, 90°, etc.) without affecting the<br>
operability of the retraction feature of the syringe. The annular surfaces 78 and 80 of the<br>
plunger and needle stem are further suitably dimensioned in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
syringe to facilitate engagement with the plunger end wall 44 and stem ring 64 at and/or near<br>
their scored sections 46 and 65 upon complete depression of the plunger, which in turn<br>
facilitates a tearing or breakage of end wall 44 from the plunger and a tearing or breakage of<br>
stem ring 64 from needle stem flange 58 to initiate retraction of needle assembly 56 into<br>
retraction cavity 48 of the plunger. Alternatively, the annular surface 78 of the plunger can be<br>
oriented to engage with a portion of the needle stem that is removed from the scored section<br>
65 a suitable distance (e.g., closer to the outer diameter of the stem ring and interior wall<br>
surface of the barrel) to establish a desired degree of leverage for the plunger with respect to<br>
the scored section 65 as the plunger engages the needle stem and thus facilitate easier and<br>
more efficient tearing or breakage of the stem ring from the needle stem flange during<br>
operation of the syringe.<br>
Assembly of the syringe is achieved by first inserting the resilient member 84 and then<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
needle assembly 56 (with or without the needle 60) into opening 23 at the proximal end of<br>
barrel 22, through main body portion 24 and into the distal end extension 26. As the stem<br>
ring 64 of needle stem 58 encounters annular shoulder 66 of the barrel, the stem ring is<br>
compressed slightly and forced distally beyond the shoulder 66 in a snap-fit engagement.<br>
Once stem ring 64 is forced distally beyond shoulder 66, the needle assembly 56 is locked in<br>
place within the distal end extension 26, and resilient member 84 is compressed to bias the<br>
needle assembly proximally within the syringe. The stem ring 64 remains compressed to a<br>
selected degree between flange 62 and the barrel interior wall surface in this locked<br>
configuration and provides an effective fluid tight seal at its compressed fit contact point with<br>
the barrel. The plunger 30 is then inserted into opening 23 of barrel 22 and axially displaced<br>
a suitable distance to facilitate use of the syringe. The needle 60 may be connected with<br>
needle stem 58 prior to insertion of the needle assembly into barrel 22. Alternatively, needle<br>
60 may be connected with the connecting portion of needle stem 58 after securing the needle<br>
stem within the barrel. In either case, needle 60 protrudes from the opening at the distal end<br>
of the barrel after assembly to facilitate use of the syringe.<br>
In operation, the distal end of the plunger is displaced a suitable distance toward the<br>
proximal end of the barrel to draw fluid from needle 60 into fluid cavity 50. Upon injection<br>
of the needle into an injection site, the plunger is then depressed toward the distal end of the<br>
barrel to force fluid from cavity 50 and through needle 60. Referring to Figs. 2-5, as the<br>
plunger is further depressed within the barrel, the frusto-conical surface 45 of plunger end<br>
wall 44 moves into the widened portion 59 of central cavity 57 of needle stem 58 to force any<br>
remaining fluid through the needle prior to retraction (thus reducing "dead" space between<br>
the engaging portions of the plunger and needle assembly). In addition, the apex of annular<br>
edge 80 of needle stem 58 engages a portion of end wall 44 at or near frusto-conical surface<br>
45 to initiate a tearing or breaking away of end wall 44 from plunger 30. Approximately<br>
contemporaneously, the apex of annular edge 78 of the plunger engages a portion of stem ring<br>
64 at or near its scored section 65, forcing a tearing or breaking away of the stem ring from<br>
flange 62 along scored section 65 at the point of contact between the stem ring and the<br>
plunger.<br>
Complete depression of the plunger within the barrel further forces plunger annular<br>

WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
edge 78 against stem ring 64, causing the portion of the stem ring that has already broken<br>
away from flange 62 to slide distally a short distance along the interior wall of the barrel so as<br>
to become oriented at a slight angle with respect to the central axis of needle stem 58 (see Fig.<br>
4). In addition, the portion of the stem ring that has not broken away is prevented from<br>
moving distally until it has become broken away from the needle stem. This sliding of the<br>
broken portion of the stem ring 64 along the interior wall of the barrel, in combination with<br>
the continued pressure applied by the fully depressed plunger to the stem ring, results in a<br>
progressive tearing or breakage of the stem ring in both directions along scored section 65<br>
until the stem ring is fully separated from tab 62. In addition, the forced engagement of<br>
annular edge 80 of needle stem 58 with plunger end wall 44 results in a progressive tearing or<br>
breakage of the end wall in both directions along scored section 46, resulting in complete<br>
separation of the end wall from plunger 30. It is noted that breaking the end wall from the<br>
plunger and also the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem requires no cutting action by<br>
annular edges 78 and 80 of the plunger and needle stem, hi fact, it is not necessary for<br>
annular edges 78 and 80 to make any contact with scored sections 65 and 46 to achieve the<br>
tearing or breakage, since the opposing forces applied by the engaging end surfaces of the<br>
plunger and the needle stem are sufficient to achieve complete breakage of plunger end wall<br>
44 from the plunger and stem ring 64 from the needle stem.<br>
The design of the syringe is configured such that end wall 44 is completely separated<br>
from plunger 30 immediately prior to or substantially simultaneously with the complete<br>
separation of stem ring 64 from tab 62. Alternatively, the syringe can also be configured such<br>
that complete separation of the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem occurs immediately<br>
prior to complete separation of the end wall from the plunger, such that the proximal bias of<br>
the needle assembly assists in forcing complete tearing of the plunger end wall. Once<br>
complete separation of the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem and complete separation<br>
of the end wall from the plunger is achieved, resilient member 84 forces needle stem 58 and<br>
needle 60, along with end wall 44, proximally into the retraction cavity 48 within the plunger<br>
(see Figs. 5 and 6).<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 6, when plunger 30 has been fully depressed within barrel 22<br>
and retraction of needle assembly 56 has occurred, flange 39 of the plunger extends slightly<br>

WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
into the extended barrel portion 27 and is locked within annular groove 29.   In this locked<br>
position, removal of the plunger from the barrel is prevented.<br>
An alternative embodiment of a syringe is depicted in Figs. 7-10 and described below.<br>
The syringe is similar in design, assembly and operability to the syringe described above and<br>
depicted in Figs. 1-6, with the same numerals designating similar components. The main<br>
differences between the syringe of Figs. 1-6 and the syringe of Figs. 7 - 10 are the design of<br>
the plunger end wall, the stem ring for the needle assembly, and the locking<br>
ledges/protrusions along the barrel interior wall surface that function to lock the needle<br>
assembly in a fixed manner prior to retraction. Referring to Fig. 7, needle stem 58 of the<br>
syringe 20' includes a radially extending flange 62 and a stem ring 64' that is attached to the<br>
flange 62 (preferably, the stem ring is molded as a part of the flange) and extends radially<br>
therefrom so as to engage with the interior wall of the barrel 22 to provide an effective fluid<br>
tight seal at the engagement. The stem ring 64' of the embodiment of Fig. 7 has a thickness<br>
dimension that is slightly greater than the stem ring 64 of the previous embodiment (depicted<br>
in Figs. 1-6) and includes a distally extending portion that fits within and engages an annular<br>
shoulder or seat 21' defined along the interior wall of the barrel. The stem ring 64' is further<br>
suitably dimensioned such that, when the needle stem 58 is inserted within the barrel and<br>
forced distally beyond annular shoulder 66 within the barrel, stem ring 64' fits snugly<br>
between the annular shoulder 66 and the seat 21' to substantially prevent any proximal or<br>
distal movement of the needle stem within the barrel prior to retraction of the needle<br>
assembly. The stem ring 64' further includes an annular notch or scored section 65' at the<br>
connection point of the stem ring 64' and needle stem 58 defining a thin membrane or<br>
reduced material section that is torn or broken away during retraction of the syringe.<br>
The end wall 44' secured at the distal end of plunger 30 (where the end wall is<br>
preferably molded as a part of the plunger) includes an annular notch or scored section 46'<br>
extending around a periphery of the end wall defining a thin membrane or reduced material<br>
section that is torn or broken away during depression of the plunger. The end wall surface<br>
45' that faces the needle assembly is substantially flat, as opposed to the frusto-conical<br>
surface 45 of the embodiment depicted in Figs. 1 -6. Similarly to that previous embodiment,<br>
the facing annular surfaces 78' and 80' of the plunger 30 and needle stem 58 are both inclined<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
at a slight angle (e.g., about 3-5°) to a plane that is perpendicular to the central axis of the<br>
syringe so as to define an apex at each annular surface that facilitates the application of<br>
pressure to both the plunger end wall 44' and the stem ring 64' during depression of the<br>
plunger within the barrel.<br>
Operation of the syringe 20' is now described with reference to Figs. 7-10. Use of the<br>
syringe is initiated by displacing the distal end of the plunger a suitable distance toward the<br>
proximal end of the barrel to draw fluid from the needle into fluid cavity 50. Upon injection<br>
of the needle into an injection site, the plunger is then depressed toward the distal end of the<br>
barrel to force fluid from cavity 50 and through the needle. As the plunger is further<br>
depressed within the barrel, the apex of annular edge 80' of needle stem 58 engages a portion<br>
of end wall 44' at or near end wall surface 45' to initiate a tearing or breaking away of end<br>
wall 44' from plunger 30.<br>
Approximately contemporaneously, the apex of annular edge 78' of the plunger<br>
engages a portion of stem ring 64' at or near its scored section 65', forcing a tearing or<br>
breaking away of the stem ring from flange 62 along scored section 65' at the point of contact<br>
between the stem ring and the plunger. However, unlike in the previous embodiment, the free<br>
portion of the stem ring 64' that has already broken away from flange 62 does not slide along<br>
the interior wall of the barrel. Rather, this free portion of stem ring 64' is substantially<br>
prevented from moving distally within the barrel due to seat 21' which buts against the stem<br>
ring.<br>
Complete depression of the plunger within the barrel forces further progressive tearing<br>
or breaking away of both stem ring 64' in both directions along its scored section 65' from<br>
flange 62 and the end wall 44' in both directions along its scored section 46' from the plunger<br>
30. As in the previous embodiment, syringe 20' is preferably designed such that end wall 44'<br>
is completely separated from plunger 30 immediately prior to or substantially simultaneously<br>
with the complete separation of stem ring 64' from tab 62. Alternatively, the syringe can also<br>
be configured such that complete separation of the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem<br>
occurs immediately prior to complete separation of the end wall from the plunger, such that<br>
the proximal bias of the needle assembly assists in forcing a complete rupture of the plunger<br>
end wall.   Once complete separation of the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem and<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
complete separation of the end wall from the plunger is achieved, resilient member 84 forces<br>
needle stem 58 and needle, along with end wall 44', proximally into the retraction cavity 48<br>
within the plunger. Thus, the manner in which retraction of the needle assembly is initiated,<br>
like in the previous embodiment, requires no cutting action by annular edges 78' and 80' of<br>
the plunger and needle stem.<br>
A further embodiment of a syringe is depicted in Fig. 11 and described below. The<br>
syringe is similar in design, assembly and operability to the syringe described above and<br>
depicted in Figs. 1 -6, with the same numerals designating similar components. However, the<br>
stem ring of the syringe of Fig. 11 is slightly modified to include one or more additional<br>
notches radially spaced from the notched or scored section along one or more surfaces of the<br>
stem ring. The additional notches enhance the tearing or breaking of the stem ring from the<br>
needle stem along the scored section. It is noted that any suitable number of notches (e.g.,<br>
one or more) can be disposed at any suitable locations along any one or more surfaces of the<br>
stem ring. The notches may further extend in a radial manner with respect to the center of the<br>
stem ring for any selected radial length (e.g., 45°, 90°, 180°, 360°, etc.).<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, the stem ring 64" includes scored section 65" near the connection<br>
point with flange 62 of needle stem 58 and a pair of notched sections 92 and 94 that are<br>
disposed on opposing surfaces of stem ring 64" and at radially spaced locations between<br>
scored section 65" and the periphery of the stem ring. The stem ring further includes a<br>
groove extending along its outer peripheral surface that engages with a notch 94 disposed<br>
along the interior surface of main body portion 24 of the barrel between annular shoulder 66<br>
and ledge 21".<br>
Assembly of syringe 20" is substantially similar to assembly of the syringes described<br>
above, with the additional feature of stem ring 64" being pushed into position within the<br>
barrel such that the peripheral groove of the stem ring mates with barrel protrusion 96. When<br>
the distal end of the plunger engages stem ring 64" to begin tearing or breakage of the stem<br>
ring from needle stem 58 at scored section 65", the stem ring is substantially prevented from<br>
sliding toward ledge 21" due to the engagement of the stem ring at its peripherally located<br>
groove and barrel protrusion 96. In addition, notched sections 92 and 94 enhance the<br>
flexibility of the stem ring as it is contacted by the plunger to further enhance breakage of the<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
stem ring at its scored section 65".<br>
The syringes described above and depicted in the figures can be modified in any<br>
number of ways without falling outside of the scope of the present invention. For example,<br>
the stem ring for the needle stem can be affixed to the interior surface of the barrel wall in any<br>
suitable manner (e.g., by thermal or ultrasonic bonding, adhesion, etc.) rather than being held<br>
in a frictional/compression tight fit with the barrel wall. In such an embodiment, the portion<br>
of the stem ring that attaches to the interior barrel wall would not be forced to an angle with<br>
respect to the central axis of the syringe during separation of the stem ring from the needle<br>
stem. However, separation would still be induced along the scored section of the stem ring to<br>
facilitate a breakage of the stem ring from the needle stem.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments, the plunger end wall can be a plug or membrane<br>
that is frictionally fit to engage with interior surface portions within the hollow plunger or,<br>
alternatively, snap fit into one or more grooves within interior surface portions of the hollow<br>
plunger. For example, referring to Fig. 12, a hollow plunger 30' includes a plug 44' that<br>
frictionally engages an interior wall surface and is held within the plunger at the plunger distal<br>
end. In another embodiment depicted in Fig. 13, a hollow plunger 30" includes a plug 44"<br>
that is snap fit into a corresponding annular groove disposed along interior wall surface near a<br>
distal end of the plunger. In each of these embodiments, the plunger membrane or plug is of<br>
suitable dimensions and is held in place with respect to the plunger during movement of the<br>
plunger within the barrel. Upon engagement of the plunger plug with portions of the needle<br>
stem, the plunger plug is forced from such engagement with the plunger and retracts with the<br>
needle stem and needle into the retraction cavity of the plunger.<br>
Other features can also be provided between the stem ring or needle holder and the<br>
barrel to prevent rotation of the stem ring and needle holder within the barrel after assembly<br>
of the syringe (e.g., when a needle hub is attached to the needle holder via a threaded<br>
engagement, the stem ring and needle holder will resist rotational movement). For example,<br>
the stem ring/needle holder can be provided with grooves, notched protrusions and/or teeth<br>
that engage with complimentary grooves, notches and/or teeth within the barrel when the<br>
needle holder is assembled within the barrel. This engagement between the needle holder and<br>
the barrel prevents rotational movement of the needle holder within the barrel, e.g., when a<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
needle is connected (via a threaded engagement) with the needle holder. Alternatively, or in<br>
addition to the teeth and grooves, any other suitable complimentary engaging structure may<br>
also be provided between the needle holder and the barrel to minimize or substantially<br>
prevent any rotation of the needle holder with respect to the barrel when the syringe is<br>
completely assembled.<br>
Other modifications to the syringe include providing cut-away sections in the<br>
extended portion at the proximal end of the barrel, where the cut-away sections provide<br>
access to gripping surfaces of the plunger thumb pad and flange for the user during aspiration<br>
of fluid into the fluid cavity of the syringe (i.e., when a portion of the plunger is pulled from<br>
the barrel). For example, two or more diametrically opposed cut-away sections can be<br>
provided along the extended barrel section. However, any suitable number of cut-away<br>
sections (e.g., one or more) can be provided in any suitable arrangement along the extended<br>
barrel section as desired for a particular application. The remaining sections of the extended<br>
barrel section will include a locking groove that engages with the thumb pad of the plunger to<br>
lock the plunger within the barrel in a similar manner as described above after use of the<br>
syringe.<br>
A syringe embodiment that incorporates some of the features as noted above, as well<br>
as further additional features, is depicted in Figs. 14-21. The syringe is similar in design,<br>
assembly and operability to the syringes described above and depicted in Figs. 1 -6, with the<br>
additional features described below. Referring to Fig. 14, a medical syringe 120 includes a<br>
hollow cylindrical barrel 122 with an opening 123 at its proximal end and suitably<br>
dimensioned to receive a hollow plunger 130. The barrel further includes an opening at its<br>
distal end to permit exposure of a needle 160 from the syringe. The barrel 122 includes a<br>
main body portion 124 that receives and retains a portion of the plunger 130 and a distal end<br>
extension 126 of reduced internal diameter in relation to the main body portion 124 that<br>
receives a needle assembly 156 as described below. At least one bump or ridge 212 is<br>
disposed along an interior surface wall portion of the main body portion 124 within and near<br>
the proximal end of the barrel to resist or prevent complete removal of the plunger from the<br>
barrel during operation of the syringe.   For example, the ridge could be continuous (e.g.,<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
forming a protruding annular ring) within the barrel. Alternatively, a series (e.g., two or<br>
more) of ridges can be provided at radially spaced locations along the interior barrel surface.<br>
The plunger 130 includes a resilient seal 132 encircling the plunger near its distal end.<br>
A fluid cavity 150 is defined within the barrel 122 between the resilient seal 132 and other<br>
distal end portions of the plunger and a distal end 125 of the barrel main body portion 124,<br>
where the fluid cavity varies in volume based upon axial displacements of the plunger with<br>
respect to the barrel. A sheath 168 is removably secured to the distal end of the barrel 122 to<br>
enclose needle 160 secured within the barrel prior to use of the syringe. As in the previous<br>
embodiments, the barrel, plunger, resilient seal, sheath and all other components of the<br>
syringe may be constructed of any suitable medical grade materials (e.g., plastics and/or<br>
stainless steels) that facilitate operability of the syringe as described below. Further, the<br>
syringe can be designed with a suitable fluid cavity to meet any fluid volume capacity for a<br>
particular application (e.g., 1 cubic centimeter or cc, 3 cc, 5 cc, etc.).<br>
The proximal end of plunger 130 includes a convex surface or domed thumb pad 138<br>
and a radially extending flange 139 that facilitates engagement with the fingers and/or thumb<br>
of the user during operation of the syringe. Similarly, the main body portion 124 of the barrel<br>
includes a radially extending flange 128 disposed near its proximal end for facilitating<br>
engagement with the fingers and/or thumb of the user during operation. An extended barrel<br>
portion 127 extends between flange 128 and the proximal end of the barrel and is slightly<br>
greater in internal diameter in comparison to the remainder of main body portion 124. The<br>
extended barrel portion 127 is also of a sufficient longitudinal dimension, and is slightly<br>
smaller in internal diameter than the transverse dimension of the plunger defined at the flange<br>
139, such that, when plunger 130 is fully depressed within the barrel, plunger flange 128<br>
forces a slight flexure of the extended barrel portion 127 at the proximal end of the barrel to<br>
permit the flange to enter the extended barrel portion.<br>
Referring to Fig. 15, two diametrically opposed sections are removed from extended<br>
barrel portion 127, so as to form cut-out areas or portions 210 along the extended barrel<br>
periphery. The cut-out portions 210 facilitate exposure of sufficient portions of the plunger<br>
thumb pad 138 and flange 139 to assist the user of the syringe in gripping the plunger when<br>
the plunger is pulled from the barrel to initiate aspiration of fluid within the fluid cavity of the<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
barrel as described below. While two cut-out sections are depicted, it is noted that any<br>
suitable number of cut-out sections can be provided (e.g., one or more) at any one or more<br>
selected locations along the extended barrel portion. Preferably, the extended barrel portion<br>
wall thickness and/or plastic or other materials from which this portion is formed are selected<br>
to facilitate a slight elastic and reversible deformation of the extended barrel portion when<br>
grasped by a user so as to further assist in axially displacing a portion of the plunger from the<br>
barrel during aspiration of fluid into the barrel.<br>
An annular groove 129 is disposed along remaining interior wall sections (i.e., the<br>
wall sections that are separated by the cut-out sections) of the extended barrel portion near the<br>
proximal end of the barrel. Upon complete depression of the plunger within the barrel and<br>
retraction of the syringe within the plunger, the plunger flange 139 engages in a snap-tight<br>
locking relationship with annular groove 129 to prevent removal of the plunger from the<br>
barrel.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, plunger 130 includes a membrane or plug 144 disposed at a distal<br>
end of the plunger and that is frictionally held between interior wall portions of the plunger<br>
(e.g., a factional engagement similar to that described above and depicted in Fig. 12). The<br>
plug 144 seals the hollow interior or retraction cavity 148 of plunger 130, with the frictional<br>
engagement between the plug and the plunger being suitable to maintain engagement of the<br>
plug with the plunger until retraction of the needle assembly occurs as described below.<br>
Alternatively, it is noted that the plunger membrane or plug can be secured at the distal end of<br>
the plunger in a snap tight fitting relationship (e.g., as in the embodiment depicted in Fig. 13)<br>
or in any other suitable manner.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 17, the distal end of plunger 130 includes an opening that<br>
communicates with retraction cavity 148 and into which plug 144 is secured. The interior<br>
annular wall at the distal end of the plunger includes an inwardly extending radial ledge 141.<br>
The diameter or transverse cross-section of the plunger opening, as defined at the ledge 141,<br>
is smaller than the diameter or transverse cross-section of the retraction cavity 148 that is<br>
defined within the plunger and lies beyond the ledge 141. Similarly, plug 144 includes an<br>
extending portion 147 that extends transversely from a proximal end of the plug. The<br>
extending portion  147 of the plug  144 is slightly larger in transverse cross-sectional<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
dimension than the transverse cross-sectional dimension of the plunger opening defined at the<br>
ledge 141, so as to facilitate frictional contact between the ledge 141 and the extending<br>
portion 147 of the plug 144. The transverse cross-sectional dimensions of the extending<br>
portion 147 as well as the rest of the plug 144 are smaller than the transverse cross-sectional<br>
dimension of the retraction cavity 148 between the plunger ledge 141 and the proximal end of<br>
the plunger. Further, the transverse cross-sectional dimension of the remaining plug portion<br>
that extends between the extending portion 147 and the distal end of the plug 144 is slightly<br>
smaller than the transverse cross-sectional dimension of the plunger opening. Thus, upon<br>
axial displacement of the extending portion 147 of the plug 144 from the ledge 141 of the<br>
plunger 130 during retraction of the needle assembly, the frictional engagement between the<br>
plunger and the plug is released and the plug is free to move into the retraction cavity.<br>
The plunger plug 144 includes a convex and frusto-conical surface 145 that extends<br>
toward the distal end of the barrel and engages with a generally complimentary, concave and<br>
frusto-conical cavity portion 159 of needle assembly 156 when the plunger is fully depressed<br>
into the barrel as described below. As noted in the previous embodiments described above,<br>
the end wall may alternatively be formed with any suitable outwardly or inwardly extending<br>
surface (e.g., conical, convex, V-shaped, multifaceted, etc.) or even a flat or planar surface as<br>
desired for a particular application. However, complimentary engaging surface features of the<br>
plunger plug and the needle assembly are preferred in order to minimize or eliminate open or<br>
"dead" space within the fluid cavity during removal of fluid from the fluid cavity.<br>
At least one notch 146 is formed on the plug at the base of the frusto-conical surface.<br>
The notch 146 can extend around the periphery of the plug at the base of the frusto-conical<br>
surface or, alternatively, consist of a single notch or one or more spaced notch sections. The<br>
notch basically serves to provide a fluid flow path between the fluid cavity within the barrel<br>
and the fluid channel in the needle assembly when the plunger is substantially or completely<br>
engages with the needle assembly. In addition, the notched plunger plug minimizes or<br>
eliminates the potential for an increase or build-up of hydraulic pressure within the fluid<br>
cavity during movement of the plunger toward the needle assembly.<br>
Needle assembly 156 includes a needle holder or stem 158 that connects with a<br>
syringe needle 160 and is affixed within the distal end extension 126 of the barrel such that<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
the needle 160 extends from the distal end of the barrel prior to and during use. The needle<br>
stem 158 and needle 160 preferably releasably engage with each other via any suitable fluid<br>
tight engagement. In a preferred embodiment, the releasable engagement between the needle<br>
stem and the needle is a threaded engagement, where the needle stem includes a male<br>
threaded configuration and the needle includes a female threaded connector to releasably<br>
connect with the needle stem. This connection, which is depicted in Figs. 14 and 17-20,<br>
differs from conventional syringe needle connections, such as Luer Lock configurations. In<br>
addition, this threaded configuration provides an easy, universal connection with needles of<br>
various gauges and types. However, it is noted that the needle can also be attached to the<br>
needle stem in any other suitable releasable or non-releasable manner.<br>
A cavity 157 extends axially from a proximal end of the needle stem 158 to the<br>
connection point with the needle 160 in order to facilitate fluid communication between the<br>
needle and fluid cavity 150 within the barrel. In addition, cavity 157 includes a widened<br>
portion 159 at the proximal end of needle stem 158 that is frusto-conical in configuration and<br>
widens toward the proximal end of the barrel so as to be generally aligned and complimentary<br>
with the frusto-conical surface 145 of the plunger 130. As noted above, when the plunger is<br>
depressed toward the needle assembly, the frusto-conical surface 145 of plug 144 generally<br>
aligns and engages with widened portion 159. When the plunger plug is brought toward and<br>
fully engages widened portion 159 of the needle assembly, notch 146 defined on plug 144<br>
ensures a fluid flow path exists between fluid cavity 150 and needle assembly cavity 157 and<br>
reduces or eliminates any build-up of hydraulic pressure within the fluid cavity.<br>
The needle stem 158 further includes a radially extending flange 162 at its proximal<br>
end that is suitably dimensioned to engage with a step or ledge 121 disposed along an interior<br>
surface of the distal end extension 126 in order to prevent movement of the needle assembly<br>
distally beyond ledge 121 during depression of the plunger toward the distal end of the barrel.<br>
A stem ring 164 is secured to and extends radially from the flange 162 of needle stem<br>
158 to engage with the interior wall surface of distal end extension 126 of the barrel. The<br>
stem ring 164 is preferably formed or molded as a part of flange 162 and needle stem 158 and<br>
includes notched or scored sections 165 at the connection point of stem ring 164 and needle<br>
stem 158, where the scored sections are formed on opposing surfaces of both the needle stem<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
flange and the stem ring. The scored sections 165 define a thin membrane or reduced<br>
material section that is torn or broken during operation of the syringe to facilitate retraction of<br>
needle assembly 156 in the manner described below. The stem ring 164 is preferably<br>
dimensioned to facilitate a partial sliding of a broken portion of the stem ring along the<br>
interior wall surface of the barrel when the plunger is depressed to engage with needle stem<br>
158 as described below.<br>
The diameter of the stem ring can be selected to be slightly smaller, the same size, or<br>
slightly larger than the diameter of the interior wall surface of distal end extension 126 at the<br>
location where the stem ring engages the barrel. In the present embodiment, the diameter of<br>
stem ring 164 is slightly larger in comparison to the diameter of the interior wall surface of<br>
the barrel that engages with the stem ring such that the stem ring is slightly compressed<br>
during engagement with the barrel and forms an effective fluid tight seal. The dimensions of<br>
the stem ring are further selected to provide a compression fit/fluid tight seal at the stem<br>
ring/barrel interior wall interface while facilitating a sliding of the stem ring with the barrel<br>
interior wall surface when the plunger is completely depressed within the barrel.<br>
Alternatively, it is noted that the stem ring can be connected directly to the barrel interior wall<br>
surface (e.g., via adhesive bonding, welding, etc.).<br>
A radial protrusion or annular shoulder 166 is disposed along the interior surface and<br>
near the proximal end of the distal end extension 126 of the barrel. The shoulder 166 engages<br>
with stem ring 164 to prevent movement of the needle assembly toward the proximal end of<br>
the barrel while the stem ring remains attached with needle stem 158. A resilient member<br>
184 (e.g., a coil spring) is disposed between the flange 162 of needle stem 158 and an interior<br>
ledge 186 disposed on the interior surface of the distal end extension 126 at a location<br>
between ledge 121 and the distal end of the barrel. When the needle assembly 156 is press fit<br>
into the distal end extension 126 of the barrel (as described below) such that stem ring 164 is<br>
extended distally beyond the radial protrusion 166 of the barrel, resilient member 184 is<br>
compressed to bias the needle assembly toward the proximal end of the barrel.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, the needle stem and barrel include complimentary protrusions<br>
and grooves that facilitate easy assembly of the needle stem within the barrel and further limit<br>
or prevent any rotation of the needle stem with respect to the barrel after assembly and during<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
operation of the syringe. In particular, needle stem 158 includes a set of protrusions or teeth<br>
200 extending transversely from the outer surface of the needle stem at a location proximate<br>
the stem ring 164. The teeth are spaced around the periphery of the needle stem and are<br>
aligned to correspond with complimentary grooves 202 disposed along the interior barrel wall<br>
surface at the distal end extension 126 and at a location generally corresponding with the<br>
barrel ledge 121. As can be seen from Fig. 16, the teeth 200 and complimentary grooves 202<br>
are configured to facilitate easy assembly of needle stem 150 within barrel 122, where the<br>
needle stem rotates as necessary upon insertion within the barrel until the teeth are<br>
appropriately aligned with the grooves and the needle stem is forced in place within the barrel<br>
distal end section. Once needle stem 158 is assembled within barrel 122 and the teeth 200<br>
engage with the grooves 202, the needle stem is prevented from rotating with respect to the<br>
barrel during operation of the syringe (e.g., when attaching or removing a needle from the<br>
needle stem, and during retraction of the needle assembly within the plunger).<br>
Alternatively, the syringe can be provided with other needle stem and barrel<br>
configurations that provide a locking engagement between the needle stem and the barrel.<br>
For example, the needle stem and barrel can include suitable complimentary protrusions<br>
and/or grooves to achieve a ratcheting or cam configuration that permits a selected degree of<br>
rotational movement of the needle stem within the barrel in one direction while limiting or<br>
preventing rotational movement of the needle stem within the barrel in an opposite direction.<br>
As in the previous embodiments, the syringe 120 is designed so that complete<br>
depression of plunger 130 within barrel 122 facilitates a displacement of plunger plug 144<br>
from the plunger and also a tearing or breaking away of the stem ring 164 from flange 162 of<br>
needle stem 158 to facilitate retraction of the needle stem and the needle 160 into the<br>
retraction cavity 148. In this embodiment, stem ring 164 of needle stem 158 includes at least<br>
one raised ridge 172 that extends from a proximal end of the needle stem and is configured to<br>
make initial contact with annular distal edge 178 of the plunger when the plunger is displaced<br>
within the barrel. While only one ridge 172 is depicted in Figs. 17-20, it is noted that any<br>
selected number of ridges can be provided at any suitable locations and suitably spaced from<br>
each other along the proximal end of the needle stem that faces the plunger. In this<br>
embodiment, the ridge 172 serves a similar purpose as the angled annular surface with apex<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
in the embodiment described above and depicted in Figs. 1-6. However, the ridge 172 further<br>
permits air bubbles that may accumulate at one or more locations along the interior wall of<br>
the barrel after aspiration of fluid within the fluid cavity to be removed from the syringe with<br>
relative ease prior to forcing fluid from the syringe in an application (e.g., injection into a<br>
patient). The annular distal edge 178 of the plunger is generally planar in configuration.<br>
However, it is noted that the plunger distal end can include any one or more protrusions like<br>
the needle stem or, alternatively, have an angled contour to form an apex as in the<br>
embodiment described above and depicted in Figs. 1 -6.<br>
Plunger resilient seal 132 is further designed and suitably dimensioned and positioned<br>
around the plunger proximate the plunger distal end such that, upon complete depression of<br>
the plunger within the barrel, a distal end of the resilient seal engages and compresses slightly<br>
against a narrowing portion 190 of the interior barrel wall that defines a transition between<br>
main body portion 124 and distal end extension 126. The resilient seal does not slide with<br>
respect to the plunger, but rather compresses slightly against the barrel wall narrowing portion<br>
at the end of the plunger stroke that initiates needle retraction, and this serves to further<br>
minimize or eliminate "dead" space within the fluid cavity 150 as well as to displace any<br>
residual fluid from the fluid cavity into needle stem cavity 157.<br>
The needle stem can be assembled within the syringe such that the ridge (or ridges) is<br>
aligned in any selected orientation with respect to the plunger distal end. The stem ring<br>
ridge(s), plunger and annular distal end of the plunger and needle stem are suitably<br>
dimensioned in the longitudinal direction of the syringe and further suitably aligned with each<br>
other to facilitate engagement of stem ring ridge(s) 172 and/or other proximal end surface<br>
portions of stem ring 164 with annular distal edge 178 of the plunger and plunger plug 144<br>
with needle stem 158 upon complete depression of the plunger, which in turn facilitates a<br>
tearing or breakage of stem ring 164 from needle stem flange 158 at the scored sections 165<br>
and a forcing of plunger plug 144 from its frictional engagement with plunger ledge 141 to<br>
initiate retraction of needle assembly 56 along with the plunger plug into retraction cavity 48<br>
of the plunger.<br>
Assembly of the syringe is achieved in a similar manner as the other syringe<br>
embodiments described above. Resilient member 184 and then needle assembly 156 (with or<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
without the needle 160) are first inserted into opening 123 at the proximal end of barrel 122,<br>
through main body portion 124 and into the distal end extension 126. As the stem ring 164 of<br>
needle stem 158 encounters annular shoulder 166 of the barrel, the stem ring is compressed<br>
slightly and forced distally beyond the shoulder 166 in a snap-fit engagement. Once stem ring<br>
164 is forced distally beyond shoulder 166, the needle assembly 156 is locked in place within<br>
the distal end extension 126, and resilient member 184 is compressed to bias the needle<br>
assembly proximally within the syringe. The stem ring 164 remains compressed to a selected<br>
degree between flange 162 and the barrel interior wall surface in this locked configuration<br>
and provides an effective fluid tight seal at its compressed fit contact point with the barrel.<br>
Plunger 130 is assembled by inserting plunger plug 144 into the plunger such that the<br>
extending portion 147 of the plug frictionally engages plunger ledge 141 located at the open<br>
distal end of the plunger and a distal portion of the plunger plug (including plug surface 145<br>
and notch 146) extends from the plunger. The plunger plug can be inserted directly into the<br>
open distal end of the plunger to its frictional fitting position. In the embodiment depicted in<br>
Figs. 14-21, the proximal end of the plunger, including thumb pad 138 and flange 139, is a<br>
single molded or formed part. Alternatively, in embodiments where the plunger flange and<br>
thumb cap are separate from the rest of the plunger (as in the embodiment described below<br>
and depicted in Fig. 22), the plunger plug can first be inserted through an open proximal end<br>
of the plunger and pushed into its frictional fitting position prior to sealing this open end with<br>
the flange and thumb pad.<br>
After assembly of the plunger, the plunger is inserted into opening 123 of barrel 122<br>
and is axially displaced a suitable distance to facilitate use of the syringe. The needle 160<br>
may be connected with needle stem 158 prior to insertion of the needle assembly into barrel<br>
122 (e.g., via the threaded engagement as depicted in Fig. 16). Alternatively, needle 160 may<br>
be connected with the connecting portion of needle stem 158 after securing the needle stem<br>
within the barrel. Once secured, needle 160 protrudes from the opening at the distal end of<br>
the barrel after assembly to facilitate use of the syringe.<br>
In operation, the distal end of the plunger is displaced a suitable distance toward the<br>
proximal end of the barrel to draw fluid from needle 160 into fluid cavity 150. Upon<br>
injection of the needle into an injection site, the plunger is then depressed toward the distal<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
end of the barrel to force fluid from cavity 150 and through needle 160. Referring to Figs.<br>
17-20, as the plunger is further depressed within the barrel, the frusto-conical surface 145 of<br>
plunger plug 144 moves into the widened portion 159 of central cavity 157 of needle stem<br>
158 to force any remaining fluid through the needle prior to retraction (thus reducing "dead"<br>
 space between the engaging portions of the plunger and needle assembly). The notch 146 on<br>
the plunger plug provides a fluid channel for fluid to continue to flow into central cavity 157<br>
even when plunger surface 145 is substantially in contact with the widened cavity portion<br>
159. In addition, ridge(s) 172 of needle stem 158 initially engages a portion of annular distal<br>
edge 178 of the plunger to initiate a tearing or breaking away of stem ring 164 from needle<br>
 stem 158 along the scored sections 165. Approximately contemporaneously, surface 145 of<br>
plunger plug 144 engages needle stem 158 within the widened cavity portion 159, and such<br>
continued depression of the plunger toward the needle assembly overcomes the frictional<br>
force holding the plunger plug within the plunger, forcing the plunger plug toward the<br>
proximal end of the plunger and into retraction cavity 148.<br>
Complete depression of the plunger within the barrel further forces plunger annular<br>
distal edge 178 against other surface portions of stem ring 164, causing the portion of the<br>
stem ring that has already broken away from flange 62 to slide distally a short distance along<br>
the interior wall of the barrel so as to become oriented at a slight angle with respect to the<br>
central axis of needle stem 158. In addition, the portion of the stem ring that has not broken<br>
 away is prevented from moving distally until it has become broken away from the needle<br>
stem. This sliding of the broken portion of the stem ring 164 along the interior wall of the<br>
barrel, in combination with the continued pressure applied by the fully depressed plunger to<br>
the stem ring, results in a progressive tearing or breakage of the stem ring in both directions<br>
along scored sections 165 until the stem ring is fully separated from tab 162. In addition, the<br>
forced engagement of plunger plug 144 with needle stem 158 results in further movement of<br>
the plunger plug from its frictional engagement with the distal end ledge 141 of the plunger,<br>
resulting in dislodging of the plunger plug from the plunger. Plunger resilient seal 132<br>
compresses slightly against the narrowed portion 190 of the barrel interior wall to force<br>
residual fluid into the needle assembly, while plunger plug notch 146 provides a fluid flow<br>
     path for such fluid when plunger surface 145 engages with needle stem 158 within widened<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
cavity portion 159.<br>
The design of the syringe can be configured such that the stem ring 164 is completely<br>
separated from needle stem 158 immediately prior to, substantially simultaneously with, or<br>
immediately after the complete dislodging of plunger plug 144 from the plunger. As shown<br>
in the series of Figs. 17-20, the initial dislodging and axial displacement of plunger plug 144<br>
begins just prior to initial contact between stem ring ridge 172 and plunger distal edge 178<br>
and partial breakage of stem ring 164 from needle stem tab 162. However, the syringe can<br>
also be designed such that initial and partial breakage of the stem ring occurs prior to any<br>
initial dislodging and axial displacement of the plunger plug. Once complete separation of<br>
the stem ring from the tab of the needle stem and at least a partial dislodging of the frictional<br>
engagement between the plunger plug and the plunger is achieved, resilient member 184<br>
forces needle stem 158 and needle 160, along with plunger plug 144, proximally into the<br>
retraction cavity 148 within the plunger.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 21, when plunger 130 has been fully depressed within barrel<br>
122 and retraction of needle assembly 156 has occurred, flange 139 of the plunger extends<br>
slightly into the extended barrel portion 127 and is locked within annular groove 129. In this<br>
locked position, removal of the plunger from the barrel is prevented.<br>
As noted above, the syringe of Figs. 14-21 can be modified such that the plunger<br>
includes a thumb pad or cap that is a separate part or component from the main plunger body.<br>
An exemplary embodiment is depicted in Fig. 22. Syringe 220 includes a barrel 122 and<br>
needle assembly that are substantially similar to the same parts or components as described<br>
above and depicted in Figs. 14-21. The plunger includes a hollow main body portion 230<br>
including a resilient seal 232 disposed near the distal end of the main body portion and that is<br>
substantially similar to the plunger seal described above in the previous embodiment. A<br>
thumb pad or cap 238 includes an insert 242 that is suitably dimensioned to fit within and<br>
frictionally engage with an opening defined at the proximal end of the main body 230. The<br>
thumb cap further includes a flange 239 that is of greater transverse cross-sectional dimension<br>
than the insert 242 and abuts the proximal end of the plunger upon engagement of the insert<br>
within the plunger. The flange 239 further provides a gripping surface for the plunger during<br>
use of the syringe as well as a tapered edge that engages with annular groove 129 in the<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
extended barrel portion 127 when the plunger is fully depressed and locked within the barrel.<br>
A plunger plug 244 is frictionally held within an opening at the distal end of the<br>
plunger in a substantially similar manner as described in the previous embodiment. However,<br>
plug 244 differs from the plunger plug of the previous embodiment in that it includes a<br>
generally flat or planar distal end surface 245 with a notch 247 disposed along this surface.<br>
The planar surface 245 of plug 244 engages with a portion of the widened cavity portion 159<br>
of the needle stem 158, while notch 247 serves to minimize hydraulic pressure build-up<br>
within the syringe cavity during axial movement of the plunger toward the needle assembly to<br>
initiate needle retraction.<br>
The design of the plunger in this manner allows easy assembly of the plunger plug. In<br>
particular, plug 244 can be inserted within plunger main body 230 at the open proximal end<br>
prior to connection of thumb cap 238 with the main body. The plunger plug can be forced<br>
through the plunger retraction cavity 248 into frictional engagement at the open distal end of<br>
the plunger main body, followed by insertion of thumb cap insert 242 into the opening at the<br>
plunger proximal end. Thumb cap 238 can be firmly secured to main body 230 in any<br>
suitable manner (e.g., via an adhesive, welding, etc.) to prevent removal of the thumb cap<br>
from the main body after assembly. Once the plunger is assembled within barrel 122, the<br>
syringe 220 operates in a substantially similar manner as the previous embodiment described<br>
above and depicted in Figs. 14-21 to facilitate a single use and needle retraction.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the syringe embodiments described above and<br>
can include additional features. For example, the syringe can further include color coding for<br>
the needle holder and matching needle cover to correspond with a particular application. In<br>
particular, matching color codes can be selected that are in compliance with ISO 6009 and/or<br>
any other selected color coding standards.<br>
The resilient seal of the plunger can also be modified such that a portion of the seal<br>
extends over at least part of the distal end of the plunger. The resilient seal can further<br>
include an opening to hold and frictionally retain a portion of a plunger plug as described in<br>
some of the previous embodiments. Providing a resilient seal that extends over the distal end<br>
of the plunger in this manner further reduces potential "dead" space that may otherwise exist<br>
within the fluid cavity of the syringe.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a syringe including a plunger resilient seal that extends<br>
around the plunger distal end is depicted in Fig. 23. The syringe embodiment of Fig. 23 is<br>
similar in design and operation to the syringe described above and depicted in Figs. 14-21,<br>
with the exception that plunger resilient seal 132' includes a distal end 302 that extends over<br>
the distal end of plunger 130. The distal end 302 of the resilient seal 132' further includes an<br>
opening that is suitably dimensioned to receive and frictionally engage plunger plug 144. In<br>
this embodiment, the plunger plug frictionally engages with both the resilient seal and the<br>
distal end ledge of the plunger, and the frictional engagement of the plunger plug with the<br>
resilient seal and plunger is overcome upon complete movement or depression of the plunger<br>
into the barrel during needle retraction. The opening in the plunger seal is also sufficiently<br>
dimensioned to permit movement of the needle stem with needle through the plunger seal<br>
during needle retraction.<br>
The syringe depicted in Fig. 23 could be modified such that the plunger plug<br>
frictionally engages with only one of the resilient seal and the plunger. In another<br>
modification of the syringe of Fig. 23, stem ring ridge 172' includes a pointed or sharp edge<br>
that faces the plunger distal end and engages with the resilient seal distal end 302 upon<br>
complete movement of the plunger into the barrel. The resilient seal 132' substantially<br>
minimizes or prevents the existence of "dead" space within the fluid cavity when the plunger<br>
is fully depressed within the barrel.<br>
As noted above, the plunger plug can also be held in a snap-tight or releasable locking<br>
configuration with respect to one or more portions of the plunger, where the snap-tight fitting<br>
arrangement is overcome upon full or complete depression of the plunger within the barrel<br>
such that the plunger plug can move with the needle stem into the retraction cavity. The<br>
snap-tight fit or releasable locking arrangement can be achieved by providing any suitable<br>
number (e.g., one or more) of protrusions and/or complimentary grooves on one or both of the<br>
plunger and plunger plug.<br>
Referring to Fig. 24, the plunger of the syringe described above and depicted in Figs.<br>
14-21 is modified to include one or more protrusions that serve to lock the plunger plug in<br>
place during use and prior to needle retraction. In particular, plunger 130' includes an<br>
inwardly extending radial protrusion 320 disposed near the plunger distal end and proximally<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
from inwardly extending radial ledge 141. When plunger plug 144 is secured within the<br>
distal end opening of the plunger, protrusion 320 abuts the extending portion 147 of the<br>
plunger plug and prevents movement of the plunger plug proximally within the retraction<br>
cavity during aspiration of fluid into and ejection of fluid from the syringe. However, upon<br>
complete depression or movement of the plunger within the barrel, the contact between the<br>
plunger plug and the needle stem forces the plug extending portion 147 beyond ridge 320,<br>
which allows the plunger plug to retract into retraction cavity 148 along with the needle stem<br>
and needle.<br>
A similar embodiment is depicted in Fig. 25, in which the syringe of Fig. 23 is<br>
modified to include snap-fit or locking elements between the plunger plug and plunger. In<br>
particular, plunger 130' includes an inwardly extending radial protrusion 320 as previously<br>
described in the embodiment of Fig. 24. In addition, plunger plug 144' includes an outwardly<br>
extending radial bump or protrusion 400 that is configured to engage with a corresponding<br>
radial groove 402 disposed along an inward surface of resilient seal 132". The protrusion 400<br>
engages with the groove 402 in a snap-fit locking arrangement to further prevent movement<br>
of the plunger plug with respect to the plunger until the plug engages the needle stem and is<br>
forced into the retraction cavity 148 along with the needle stem.<br>
The syringe can further be designed with a needle locking feature to prevent<br>
inadvertent removal or release of the syringe needle from the needle stem or holder during use<br>
of the syringe. For example, in embodiments in which the needle is removably secured to the<br>
needle holder via a threaded engagement, the needle locking feature prevents inadvertent<br>
separation between the needle and the needle holder that may otherwise occur due to<br>
inadvertent twisting of the needle with respect to the needle holder when the needle cover or<br>
sheath is removed from the syringe and/or other twisting forces are applied to the needle by<br>
the user during syringe operation.<br>
The needle locking feature can be implemented in the syringe described above and<br>
depicted in Figs. 14-21 by providing at least one protrusion and at least one corresponding<br>
locking groove on the male and female threaded connectors of the needle holder and needle.<br>
Referring to Figs. 26A and 26B, a modified embodiment of the syringe of Figs. 14-21 is<br>
depicted, where  needle  stem  158'  of the needle  assembly includes a male threaded<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
configuration that releasably connects with a corresponding female threaded connector 400<br>
for needle 160. As can be seen from Fig. 26A, the male threaded portion of needle stem 158'<br>
extends radially from and winds around the stem. The male threaded portion further includes<br>
a starting or lead-in portion 402 that ramps radially outward from the needle stem until it<br>
achieves the final radial dimension of the male threaded portion. A groove or notch 406 is<br>
disposed on lead-in portion 402 of the needle stem male threaded portion, where the notch<br>
406 extends transversely across the lead-in portion. A corresponding bump or protrusion 408<br>
is disposed on a female threaded portion 404 of connector 400.<br>
The notch and protrusion are suitably dimensioned and aligned on each of the needle<br>
assembly and female threaded connector for the needle such that, upon substantially complete<br>
engagement of the male threaded needle assembly with the female threaded connector for the<br>
needle, protrusion 408 slides into and engages with notch 406 to provide a releasable locking<br>
engagement between the needle assembly and the needle. In particular, the protrusion 408<br>
rides over the initial ramping section of lead-in portion 402 until it encounters and engages<br>
with notch 406. This locking engagement resists slight and inadvertent torque or twisting<br>
forces applied to the needle (e.g., during removal of sheath 168 from the syringe) and can be<br>
overcome upon applying a sufficient twisting force to the needle with respect to the needle<br>
assembly.<br>
Optionally, the protrusion and/or groove can include multi-faceted and/or ramped<br>
surfaces to facilitate a ratchet-like locking action, where the twisting of the needle with<br>
respect to the needle assembly in a first direction (e.g., a clockwise direction) so as to engage<br>
the male and female threaded connections is facilitated with relative ease to lock the<br>
protrusion with the groove, while the twisting of the needle with respect to the needle<br>
assembly in a second direction that opposes the first direction (e.g., a counter-clockwise<br>
direction) is resisted by the engagement of the protrusion in the groove. In addition, the<br>
sheath may also be designed to prevent twisting of the sheath with respect to the syringe<br>
barrel during removal of the sheath, so as to further minimize or prevent inadvertent twisting<br>
of the needle with respect to the needle assembly.<br>
A syringe in accordance with the present invention can also be configured for use in<br>
other, needle-free applications (i.e., applications that do not include the use of needles). For<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
example, a syringe of the present invention can be configured with a suitable connector to<br>
connect directly with an intravenous (IV) fluid line for injection of fluid from the syringe into<br>
the IV line. The retraction of the needle stem would prevent further use of the syringe after a<br>
single fluid injection.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to a specific<br>
embodiment thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Thus,<br>
it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
