The present invention relates to materials handling and more particularly to any one or more of a method of partitioning solids of a slurry three ways, partitioning apparatus useful therefor, a method of handling abrasive solids materials so as to provide for at least a partial recycle of part thereof, a related abrasive slurry cutting plant and abrasive material prepared by such procedures for subsequent use.<br>
In a jet cutting procedure a water jet customarily employs abrasive solids of a desirable size range, density, hardness and abrasiveness to enhance the erosion effect of the jet on a wide variety of work pieces that normally are interposed between the nozzle from which the jet issues and a catcher tank. Examples of the abrasive type materials used are aluminium oxide, garnet, copper slag, etc.<br>
Examples of materials handling insofar as the abrasive components of plant and procedures in water jet systems include those disclosed in the 2000 publication of BHR Group entitled getting Technology"pages 389 to 399,<br>
It can be seen that such prior art systems have attempted to re-employ some of the abrasive caught by the catcher tank along with kert from the work piece whilst rejecting solids of an undesirably small particle size. For this purpose one prior art procedure has employed both a hydro-cyclone and a sieve. Such hydro-cyclones are prone to wear with a result in significant maintenance costs which detracts from the cost saving recycle. Such wear in addition reduces performance and requires the use of large quantities of water.<br>
Another system disclosed uses sieve screens (see www, easijet. com).<br>
The present invention is directed to methods and apparatus having application in a partial recycle of abrasive materials used in a water jet cutting system which relies on a flow through over a sieve to achieve a partition of particles in the flow through or on the sieve not to be used through the nozzle from those that are to be so used. Such a procedure can remove oversized particles that might have a tendency to block the jetting nozzle and at the same time can ensure there is little use in the recycle of abrasive material or kerf material of too small a size to be useful.<br><br>
The system also optionally lends itself to a makeup of abrasive materials in use throughout the overall system that does not undermine the value of the recycle procedure.<br>
The handling system useful in such a jet cutting plant will have application elsewhere wherever a partitioning of solids entrained in a slurry at least two (and preferably three) ways is required. Therefore the partitioning apparatus and partitioning method of the present invention has wider applicability, eg ; with any other liquid entrainment system.<br>

A preferred form of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing a slurry jet issuing nozzle over a catcher tank from whence a fluid tight flow path exists to an inlet into partitioning apparatus having disposed within a housing thereof a sieve over a collection zone and under an outlet for flow through of part of the slurry above the sieve, Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view of a whole abrasive jet cutting plant employing the arrangement substantially as disclosed in Figure 1 showing appropriate controls, and Figure 3 shows a preferred housing with sieve of a partitioning plant in cutaway perspective.<br>
In the preferred form of the present invention a nozzle 7 is adapted to receive a slurry containing abrasive materials (preferably in a size range of from about 10% to about 70%<br><br>
of the nozzle diameter via a flow path 21 from a pressure vessel 17. The abrasive slurry from the nozzle 7 is jetted downwardly over the catcher tank 8.<br>
The catcher tank 8 includes an isolation valve 9 capable of isolating the tank from the drain via flow path 38, There is a flow path 22 to an inlet 23 of the partitioning apparatus such as preferably disclosed in Figures 1 and 3, This flow path 22 includes a further catcher tank isolation valve 10.<br>
The partitioning apparatus comprises a hopper 25 having an inlet 23 and an outlet 26 both above a sieve screen 27 enable of being shaken or vibrated actively above an outlet (the second outlet) 28 which leads to a collection zone 15.<br>
The first outlet 26 forms part of a flow path 29 via a valve 29 to a drain or catchment.<br>
The collection zone 15 includes a flow path therefrom 32 to the pressure vessel 17.<br>
That flow patch 32 is preferably valved by valve 16.<br>
A low pressure water supply (for example 6 to 9 bar) 19 passes via a flow path 33, a pump 31, and a flow path 34 into the pressure vessel 17, As a consequence of use of pump 31a high pressure water feed (for example, of from 690 to 1000 bar) which is sufficient pressure (when the valve 16 is closed and suction pump 12 is not operating on the flow path 35 back to the partitioning apparatus) to express an abrasive material laden slurry from tank 17 via the flow path 36 through the nozzle 7 as a jet.<br>
The water supply 19 is capable of being introduced at valve 16 (eg; an electrical solenoid valve) into the flow path 32 as shown in Figure 2,<br>
A water and/or slurry retum from pressure vessel 17 under the action of a vacuum pump 12 on flow path 35 into the catcher assists in providing the water requirements for a slurry best able to flow along the flow path 32 to the pressure vessel 17.<br><br>
A air pressurising fan or pump 1 on a flow path 40 into make up tank 2 can force, when valve 5 allows and valve 3 is closed, make up abrasive into the catcher tank 8 via flow path 39 and, when valve 5 is closed and valve 3 is open, to the drain 37,<br>
A drain is depicted generally as 37 and to this can be allowed to flow part of the water feed from the pump 31, the outflow of the undersize less dense materials from the partitioning apparatus (eg ; under action of vacuum pump 30) and any water and light material outflow from the catcher tank 8 (via the flow path 38), In addition, if desired a make up abrasive material tank 2 can itself have an operable a feeder valve 5 to the catcher tank 8 where it blends make up feeds of abrasive with used abrasive (and kerf material from any work piece interposed between the slurry and the jet issuing nozzle 7),<br>
A control panel 4 is electrically connected to at least valve 5, (optionally) valve 6, valve 10, valve 16, (optionally) vacuum pump 30, (optionally) pump 31, (optionally) pump 10 (optionally) @@@@pply fan 1.<br>
In operation the slurry passes thru nozzle 7 and cuts worlpiece. The spent abrasive and worlcpiece waste falls into catch tank 8 below. The slurry pump 11 sucks the slurry from the catch tank 8 thru the sieve shaker 13, The small light particles of product waste and non-recyclable abrasive follows the flow out of the sieve shaker 13 to the slurry pump 11 and off to waste containment. The heavier and larger (recyclable) abrasive particles drop onto the sieve screen in the shaker. Any large scrap particles too big to pass thru the screen remains on top for collection, the remaining particles pass thru the screen and fill the hopper below. An abrasive height measurement device 14 inside the hopper sends a signal to the new abrasive feed valve 5 to add new abrasive into the catch tank when the level in the hopper 15 falls below a certain point. The new abrasive feed valve is fed with abrasive from the abrasive hopper 2 under pressure of air and feeds abrasive into the mix to replace the volume of abrasive that has passed straight thru the sieve shaker 13 to the slurry pump 11 and waste due to it being too fine to be recycled. This new abrasive mixes with the used slurry in the catch tank 15 and also passes together with it thru the sieve shaker removing any oversized abrasive.<br><br>
When the pressure vessel 17 needs to refill itself another suction pump 12 sucks water from the vessel and creates a vacuum which then draws abrasive laden slurry from the hopper 15 into the vessel 17, The heavy abrasive settles into and fills the vessel whilst the rest of the water passes thru the slurry pump 12 and is pumped back into the sieve shaker,<br>
A preferred form will now be described with reference to the Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows in cross section the inlet 23 being a 15 mm diameter inlet and the outlet 26 as a 15 mm diameter outlet both positioned about 100 mm above the sieve 27 which in one form of the present invention is a 150 US mesh standard sieve adapted to allow through particles below 0.15 mm in size with such a sieve and such inlet/outlet configuration preferably distance across the housing 25 between the first inlet or inlet 23 and the first outlet 26 is approximately 250 mm.<br>
We have determined that where a slurry having abrasive materials and kerf therein with a solids content of 0.3 kg/min at a flow rate of 2 litres/min is introduced by the inlet 23 there is, in steady state conditions, an outflow of about 2 litres/min via the outlet 26 with the outcome that most of the oversized materials, (ie; above 0,15 mm in particle size re collected on the screen 27 carried under a removable assembly 28 (the removal of preferably also removes an optional trap 29 to which above 0, 15mm particles migrate under the effect of flow and vibration) and most of the other particles sizes (ie ; below 0,025 mm particle size) exit via the outlet 26 whilst the remainder settles into the collection zone 15 from whence it can be reused.<br>
That proportion of material wrongly passing through to the outlet 26, (ie ; is material that should have reached collection zone 15) is not greater than about 5% w/w and that material that should have passed out of the outlet 26 (ie ; undesirable lighter or smaller abrasive particles) but which is collected in collection zone 15 is no more than about 5%<br>
w/w.<br>
It has been found that the three way partitioning can be achieved by the methods and apparatus of the present invention for various slurries and various rates of flow thereof by<br><br>
appropriate tuning to geometry (e, g, inlet with respect to screen and outlet) and screen size.<br>
It is appropriate to ensure with geometry of the apparatus and flow rates that the slurry transit times in flow through from inlet 23 to outlet 26 is such that it is higher than the settling out time of those small particles to be excluded from the collection zone.<br>
With the arrangement of Figure 3 oversized materials collecting on the screen will naturally migrate to a catchment area at the end of the sieve and can be periodically removed (eg ; with screen removal and replacement) or preferably can be collected in a trap peripherally of the screen (ie ; they migrate under the shaking of the screen [e, g. by some eccentric mass (not shown) acting on the member 30] and/or with effect of the flow through) from whence they can be removed. To enhance this effect the sieve or screen 27 can slope slightly to trap 29 and the sieve carrying assembly 28 can be resiliently moimted relative to member 30 reliant on rubber bushes 31,<br><br><br><br>

a slurry at a rate and velocity into the housing above the sieve such that at least<br>
some of the liquid component(s) of the slurry will, as a flow through, entrains a first<br>
part of the solids out through said first outlet, the rate and velocity is such as to<br>
enable at least some oversize material to migrate across the sieve and pass through<br><br>
said second outlet, and at least some sieve passable solids of greater density than the entrained solids of the flow through to pass down through the sieve.<br>
18.	Apparatus of claim 17 wherein there is provided a drive whereby said sieve, in use, is capable of being actively shaken and/or vibrated.<br>
19.	Apparatus as claimed in claim 17 or 18 wherein said collection zone is a reservoir adapted so that collected solids as a slurry on demand (optionally with the addition of additional water) is fed as a slurry to a pressure vessel.<br>
20.	A method of partitioning solids of a slurry three ways, said method comprising providing a housing having an inlet, a first outlet, and a collection zone, and, disposed therein, a sieve disposed below said first inlet and said first outlet but above said collection zone,<br>
passing a slurry via said inlet into the housing across the sieve and, in part, out of<br>
said first outlet whilst at least some of the solids of the slurry fall onto and/or<br>
through the sieve,<br>
harvesting or using the solids that have passed through said sieve and into said<br>
collection zone,<br>
harvesting or disposing of those solids that have passed out of said first outlet,<br>
wherein said housing includes a second outlet via which a removing of those solids<br>
collected on the sieve occurs.<br>
21.	A method as claimed in claim 20 wherein the harvesting or using of the solids that pass out of said second outlet or into said collection zone is as a slurry.<br>
22.	A method as claimed in claim 20 or claim 21 wherein the harvesting or disposal of the solids that pass out of said first outlet is as a slurry.<br>
23.	A method as claimed in any one of claims 20 to 22 wherein the harvesting or using of the solids that pass through the sieve is by a slurry feed thereof from said collection zone or from said second outlet into a pressure vessel from whence the solids may be expressed under the action of water addition into such pressure<br>
vessel.<br><br>
24.	A method of any one of claims 20 to 23 wherein said slurry to be partitioned<br>
includes solids for recycle use in an abrasive water jetting system.<br>
25.	Partitioning apparatus substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to any<br>
one or more of the accompanying drawings.<br>
26.	A method of partitioning solids substantially as hereinbefore described with<br>
reference to any one or more of the accompanying drawings.<br>
