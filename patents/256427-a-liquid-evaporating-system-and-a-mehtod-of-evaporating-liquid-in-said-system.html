				<td>[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an effective evaporation or distillation<br>
method and equipment capable of forming a multiple effective evaporator in the<br>
manner that a plural of horizontal plate typed evaporators having a partitioned<br>
space into a steam heating chamber and an evaporating chamber are<br>
perpendicularly stacked and of using a re-heated steam generated from the<br>
horizontal plate typed evaporator as a heat source of a next adjacent horizontal<br>
plate typed evaporator, and in particular to a method and equipment capable of<br>
evaporating and distilling a salt water or a liquid phased material so that a<br>
re-heated steam may be successively and repeatedly evaporated until the<br>
re-heated steam is reached at a last horizontal plate typed evaporator in the<br>
manner that in a plural of horizontal plate typed evaporators a high temperature<br>
steam supplied from a conventional PTC or CPC typed solar heat, or a general<br>
steam boiler is provided to only first horizontal plate typed evaporator and a steam<br>
is generated from a distillation water and after re-heated a steam generated from<br>
first horizontal plate typed evaporator rs supplied to second first horizontal plate<br>
typed evaporator and a steam is generated from a distillation water at second<br>
horizontal plate typed evaporator. So, an initial solar heat or an evaporation from a<br>
general evaporation boiler functions as an evaporation source and also<br>
evaporation water generated from the horizontal plate typed evaporators gets<br>
evaporated. Evaporation from each of the horizontal plate typed evaporators is<br>
condensed after a heat is mutually exchanged in a heating chamber at the<br>
evaporator, resulting in being changed into high temperature distillation water. The<br>
high temperature distillation water makes evaporation water preheated by carrying<br>
out a heat exchange with the evaporation water to be flowed into an evaporating<br>
chamber and thereby the evaporation water is effectively evaporated.<br>
[Background Art)<br>
For the purpose of enhancing evaporation efficiency, various methods have<br>
been used in a most of conventional evaporators, A multiple effective evaporator<br>
out of conventional evaporators is to improve the gradual degrading of a steam<br>
temperature every when the generated steam is one by one passed through the<br>
evaporators in the course of a reusing the generated steam. The improvement is<br>
to make an atmosphere pressure of a respective evaporating chamber low using a<br>
decompression pump. This requires paying a high expense and having many<br>
equipment sources. Further, in constituting a plural of evaporators a maximum<br>
number of evaporators are restricted by fourteen evaporators to carry out a<br>
multiple effective evaporation. A multiple injection evaporation method which is like<br>
as this method also has problems in that it is to have a reducing pressure which is<br>
the same problem as a multiple effective evaporation method and in a steam<br>
compression evaporation method it is uneconomic to compress a steam and to<br>
have a limit of a processing amount, as well as a big structure.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem!<br>
The present invention is designed in consideration of the above problems,<br>
and therefore it is an object of the invention to provide an effective evaporation or<br>
distillation method and equipment capable of being formed in a plate shape and<br>
stacked with multiple layer structures, thereby minimizing an occupied space on<br>
an evaporation system and reheating a steam generated from an evaporation and<br>
then it is easy to generate the steam without the reducing pressure of the<br>
evaporation at an evaporating chamber, resulting in constituting the effective<br>
evaporation system. In such effective evaporation system, a plural of evaporators<br>
are consisted of more compared to the other evaporation method and also it is<br>
economic to re-heat the steam, that is, the increasing of the steam temperature<br>
with its compression by 101C requires the consumption of 15 kcal/kg, but the<br>
increasing of the steam temperature with its direct heat by 10T: requires the<br>
consumption of 3.8 kcal/kg.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a<br>
multiple effective evaporation equipment in a steam reheating method comprises:<br>
a plate typed horizontal evaporator having a partitioned space into upper and<br>
lower, which includes a heat exchange boundary face formed in a concavo-convex<br>
shape which has a wide heat exchange area to effectively carry out a heat<br>
exchange at the mediate of the horizontal typed evaporating chamber and the<br>
heating chamber and made of a metal plate such as aluminum or copper having a<br>
high thermal conductivity. The multiple effective evaporation equipment is a<br>
construction formed in a multiple stacked method. The steam reheating unit can<br>
individually re-heat the steam from the respective evaporator. The condensed<br>
distillation water from the respective evaporating chamber and the evaporation<br>
water to be flowed into the evaporating chamber are mutually cross-encountered<br>
at a heat exchanger to make to be preheated. In case of using solar heat steam<br>
boiler equipment may be constituted in a condensation typed solar heat method<br>
having a parabolic reflector. The present invention is characterized in having a<br>
structural big volume and an occupation on a wide space with regard to that a<br>
thermal exchange method using a conventional metal tube is used in evaporating.<br>
Also, it may be uneconomic in view of adiabatic, operational, vacuum, or<br>
compression cost. The present invention has an evaporator having a plate shape<br>
and a small spatial occupation with a multi-stacking. Because of a multi stacked<br>
evaporator in view of operation, it is to enhance an energy re-using efficiency and<br>
to reduce an evaporation cost. Moreover, it is to be able to evaporate salt water or<br>
a liquid phased material using a solar heat even where energy supply is not<br>
smooth.<br>
(Advantageous Effects]<br>
By using an effective evaporation or distillation method and equipment<br>
according to the present invention, when a steam generated from a solar heat or a<br>
steam boiler is distillated or evaporated at first evaporator in a plural of<br>
evaporators and successively the other evaporators makes an evaporation of its<br>
next adjacent evaporator to be carried out without the reducing pressure by a<br>
re-heated steam generated from itself, and thereby enhancing an evaporation<br>
efficiency as much as its double number.<br>
