				<td>The present invention relates to antisfatic  composition comprising a thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate and an antistatic mixture.<br>
The invention relates to a composition comprising a thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) and an antistatic mixture (B) in, the form of contiguous fibres, which mixture comprises (b1) an organic polymeric material that is fibrous or forms fibres on mixing and is not soluble in the thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A); (b2) a polymer or copolymer capable of ion conduction that has blocks for complexing or solvating a salt of an<br>
inorganic or low-molecular-weight organic protonic acid (b3) and has a better compatibility with the organic polymer (b1) that is fibrous or forms fibres on mixing than with the polymeric organic substrate (A); and (b3) a salt of an inorganic or low-molecular-weight organic protonic acid that has been complexed or solvated in the polymer or copolymer (b2). The invention relates also to the antistatic mixture (B) itself, to its use for rendering polymers antistatic and to a process for the preparation of antistatic thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrates.<br>
It is known that polymers are subject to a strong electrostatic charge and that charges, once applied, can be discharged only slowly because of the low electrical conductivity of polymers. Rapid discharging is required not only for aesthetic reasons but also, in many cases, for reasons of safety. The following adverse effects in use may be mentioned: soiling of polymer surfaces, electrical shocks to persons touching polymers, disruption of production caused by the adhesion of film webs, destruction of electronic components, lump formation in polymer powders, and sparking, caused by charges being too high, with subsequent ignition, which has already frequently resulted in serious explosions.<br>
It is known to limit static charging by the addition of additives that improve surface conductivity, but such substances have the disadvantage of being ineffective in practice when atmospheric humidity is low. It is therefore better to use additives that are effective at low atmospheric humidity, which can usually be achieved by increasing the volume conductivity. The known substances for increasing volume conductivity, for example carbon black or metal powder, however, alter the mechanical properties of the polymers and cannot be used for transparent polymers. In addition, there is an increasing requirement for additives to be ecologically unobjectionable.<br>
Further details relating to antistatic additives and the mechanism of static charging may be found, for example, in the "Plastics Additives Handbook", editors R. Gachter and H. Muller, Hanser Verlag, 3rd edition, 1990, pages 749-775.<br>
In order to render materials permanently antistatic, it has already been proposed in DE-A-4 324 062 to coat materials that have a large surface area, such as fibres, with a semi-conductive colourless material, for example tin oxide. The coated material may then be admixed and processed with the polymer granules. However the preparation of the coating is complex, since the semi-conductive combination has to be made by impregnating fibrous carriers with an aqueous salt solution, subsequently drying and then thermally conditioning the deposited salt. That chemical and thermal processing applied to the fibres may damage the fibres, which may result in a lower conductivity than was to have been expected from the conductivity of the semi-conductors. A further disadvantage is that the fibres bend as a result of mechanical stress, and the brittle semi-conductor coating may become damaged, thereby also impairing the conductivity.<br>
A further possibility is described in DE-A-4 316 607, which proposes adding commercially available metallised synthetic fibres to lubricants, adhesives or coating materials, thereby increasing their electrical conductivity. Metallised fibres are relatively expensive and complicated to produce, however, and markedly reduce the transparency of the polymer into which they are incorporated. In addition, mechanical damage to the conductive layer and even to the fibres (fracture) cannot be completely avoided.<br>
In EP-A-0 613 919 certain polyether ester amides are proposed as antistatic additives for thermoplastic polymers. In specific embodiments, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halides may be added in addition. The addition also of a polymer that provides compatibility between the thermoplastic substrate and the polyether ester amide is proposed, in order to improve adhesion and mechanical properties. In the concept proposed therein for rendering the polymers antistatic, compatibility and good miscibility of the polymers appear to be important properties.<br>
In view of the above-mentioned limitations of the known methods of rendering polymers antistatic, there continues to be a need for an antistatically active, ecologically unobjectionable additive system for increasing volume conductivity that is effective at low<br>
atmospheric humidity, which system is simple to produce, can easily be incorporated into or mixed with the polymer, retains over a long period the volume conductivity of the polymer achieved and, without any notable restriction, can be used in small amounts in all commercially available polymers.<br>
It has now been found that a fibre-forming or fibrous organic polymeric material together with a further polymer or copolymer capable of ion conduction can be so incorporated into a thermoplastic or elastomeric substrate that the polymer or copolymer is substantially adsorptively bound to the fibre or dissolved in it and together with it forms a network in the thermoplastic or elastomeric substrate in which the fibre is not soluble. A portion of the polymer or copolymer capable of ion conduction has polar groups that are capable of complexing or solvating a salt of an inorganic or organic protonic acid.<br>
The fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric material must be so selected that it does not dissolve in the thermoplastic or elastomeric substrate but is able to form a net-like structure of contiguous fibres.<br>
For good electrical conductivity it is advantageous for the fibres of the organic material to be contiguous with one other or to cross one another at as many sites as possible once they have been incorporated in the polymer. By that means electrically conductive paths are formed through which the charges can flow away.<br>
Since the fibres and the polymers or copolymers capable of ion conduction are high-molecular-weight compounds, there is also virtually no risk of their being exuded, with the result that the antistatic property is especially durable.<br>
The stability properties of the polymer, such as thermostability and resistance to light and hydrolysis, are in most cases virtually unaffected.<br>
When the amounts added are small, the optical properties are modified only slightly and transparent materials remain substantially transparent, which is of great importance for many fields of use.<br>
The invention relates to a composition comprising a thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) and an antistatic mixture (B) in the form of contiguous fibres, which mixture<br>
comprises (b1) an organic polymeric material that is fibrous or forms fibres on mixing and is not soluble in the thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A); (b2) a polymer or copolymer capable of ion conduction that has blocks for complexing or solvating a salt of an inorganic or low-molecular-weight organic protonic acid (b3) and has a better compatibility with the organic polymer (b1) that is fibrous or forms fibres on mixing than with the polymeric organic substrate (A); and (b3) a salt of an inorganic or low-molecular-weight organic protonic acid that has been complexed or solvated in the polymer or copolymer<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) and an antistatic mixture (B) in the form of contiguous fibres, which mixture comprises (bl) an organic polymeric material that is fibrous or forms fibres on mixing and is not soluble in the thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) which is selected from the group consisting of a polyacrylic acid ester, polymethacrylic acid ester, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl alchol, polyvinyl acetate, polyamide, polyurethane or polyester;<br>

Preferably, the thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) is a polyolefin, a poly¬styrene, a copolymer of acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS), a polymer of a,p-unsaturated acids, a halogen-containing polymer, a homo- or co-polymer of cyclic ethers, a polymer of unsaturated alcohols and amines, a polyacetal, a polyphenylene oxide, a polyurethane, a polyamide, a polyester, a polyurea, a polycarbonate, a polysulfone or natural rubber.<br>
The thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) is especially a polyolefin, a poly¬styrene, an acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS) copolymer, a polymer of a,p-unsaturated acids, a halogen-containing polymer or a homo- or co-polymer of cyclic ethers.<br>
The thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate (A) is more especially polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene, polyethylene in its various modifications, or polypropylene.<br>
The fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric material (b1) may already be in the form of long spun fibres or in the form of cut staple fibres, and may be used in that form. It is also<br>
possible for the fibres that are present to be used in the form of a planar network, a woven pattern, a non-woven fabric or a felt.<br>
The fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric material (b1) is preferably in the form of synthetically produced polymer fibres.<br>
Examples of suitable fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric materials are polyamides and copolyamides, polyesters, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, modified cellulose, polyacrylic acid esters, polymethacrylic acid esters, polyacrylonitrile, modacryl (copolymer of acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride), polyolefins, polyanhydrides, polyester amides, polyphenylene sulfide, polyfluorohydrocarbons, polyurethane and polyurea.<br>
Preferably, the fibres comprise the polymer or copolymer (b2) capable of ion conduction at the surface or over the cross-section and they are contiguous with one another in the polymer matrix, since by that means the volume conductivity may occur by way of ions.<br>
The fibrous organic material generally has a length of from 0.01 to 200 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 20 mm. It may be in the form of macroscopic fibres, but also small fibrils having microscopic cavities may be present.<br>
It is also possible, however, to use the fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric material in the form of granules or powder. When mixing and processing with the polymeric substrate, for example in calenders, three-roll mills, extruders or kneaders, a fibrous or fibrillar align¬ment is achieved as a result of the fibre-forming organic polymeric material not being soluble in the substrate polymer and extending substantially in one dimension owing to the processing or mixing process. The result can, if desired, be further improved by a subsequent additional drawing process. Methods of mixing and processing thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers are known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in Kunststoff-Taschenbuch, 12th edition, Manser Verlag 1979, pages 35-195.<br>
The fibrous polymeric material (or polymeric material which forms fibres on mixing) (b1) is preferably a polyacrylic acid ester, a polymethacrylic acid ester, a polyacrylonitrile, a poly¬vinyl alcohol, a polyvinyl acetate, a polyamide, a polyurethane or a polyester.<br>
The fibrous polymeric material (or polymeric material which forms fibres on mixing) (b1) is especially a polyester, polyamide (x) or polyamide (x,y) in which x and y are each independ¬ently a number from 4 to 14.<br>
It is more especially polyamide 4,6, polyamide 6,6, polyamide 6 or the copolyamide 6/6,6.<br>
A large number of fibrous or fibre-forming polymers are available commercially. If material that is already fibrous is used, then the material may be selected in various fibre thick¬nesses. Fibre thicknesses are usually quoted in dtex (g/10000 m). Fibre thicknesses of from 0.5 to 500 dtex are typical, with the use of fibre thicknesses of from 1 to 100 dtex being preferred.<br>
Preferred polymers or copolymers (b2) are oligoethoxylated acrylates or methacrylates, styrene oligoethoxylated at the aromatic ring, polyether urethanes, polyether ureas, polyether amides, polyether ester amides and polyether esters. The copolymers may be random copolymers or block copolymers, with block copolymers being preferred (claim 7).<br>
Polyether amides and polyether ester amides are especially preferred.<br>
A block copolymer is especially a polyether ester amide in which the polyether segments consist of polyethylene glycol units having a molecular weight Mn of from 200 to 6000 daltons and the polyamide segments consist of polyamide (x) or polyamide (x,y) having a molecular weight Mn of from 200 to 6000 daltons, x and y being a number from 4 to 14.<br>
Suitable polyether ester amides are described, for example, in EP-A-613 919.<br>
Other equally well suited polyether ester amides and the preparation thereof are described inDE-OS-2523991.<br>
Polymers or copolymers according to the invention are commercially available or may be prepared, for example, in accordance with a process described in EP-A-613 919 or DE-OS-2523991.<br>
An important prerequisite in the choice of the polymers or copolymers (b2) in conjunction with the fibrous or fibre-forming material (b1) is that the two have a higher affinity for each other than for the thermoplastic or elastomeric polymeric substrate. This can be achieved, for example, by part of each of them having the same polymeric skeleton.
