This invention relates to a stone slicing machine<br>
Stone slicing machines are known to the art. However such machines consist of a single circu¬lar saw blade which necessitates slicing of stone slabs in multiple passes that is to say, the number of times the blade has to pass through the slab deeper and deeper before completing the slic¬ing operation<br>
On the other hand, it is proposed, according to this invention, to provide at least one pair of saw blades in the place of the single saw blade hitherto used in the known machines. However, the mere provision of a pair of saw blades will not be workable unless other constructional features comprised in this invention are present. Firstly, the twin saw blades are positioned to slice the slabs from the top as well as from the bottom of the slabs. Secondly, the vertical axes of the blades passing through their centers of rotation are spaced so that the slicing action is effective from top to bottom, through and through.<br>
Some of other salient advantages and features of this invention are given hereinbelows<br><br>
In the known stone slicing machines, stones have to be sliced, normally, in a multiple pass opera¬tion, which means, that the saw blades will have to 90 over the cut again and again, each time a little deeper, before the slab is fully sliced. In the machine proposed herein, however, a single pass operation will suffice because of the unique slicing operation taking place from top and bot¬tom, with offset twin blades. It is only in the case of a few tough stones such as granite that the need to employ multiple pass operation may become necessary. In such event, the machine proposed has provision for drawing the saw blades of a pair together after each pass to enable them to penetrate the depth of the slab.<br>
The machine proposed herein saves power. The twin saw blades have cutting tip width smaller than that of the larger single saw blade used conven¬tionally; consequently, the sludge formed along the cut is less, which means that the work done is less. Additionally, less sludge formation also signifies less wastage of stone and more produc¬tion,  since the work to be accomplished  is com-<br><br>
pelted in a shorter period, which is the same thing as saying that for a given period of time the output is more.<br>
Less sludge formation also means enhanced service life for the saw blades..<br>
The cost of consumables is also substantially less in the machine proposed. Smaller saw blades, even taken as a pair , cost less by reason of smaller cutting tip width, lesser number of tips and so on.<br>
Slab breakage is less, especially with thin slabs, because in the machine proposed, the slicing stresses acting on the slabs, during operation, are more evenly distributed than in the case of the conventional machines wherein the stresses tend to concentrate. Consequently, wear and tear on the machine, due to vibration and other concom¬itant factors, are less.<br>
As a result of the foregoing advantages, trans¬portation of stone from the quarries to the facto¬ry and of the finished goods from the factory to the consumer will cost less.<br><br>
Various other features of the machine proposed herein will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The stone slicing machine, according to this invention, comprises at least one stone slab carrier provided with means for clamping the slabs in place; at least one pair of power driven circu¬lar saw blades mounted on supporting means such that one blade of the pair slices the slabs from the top, while the other blade of the pair slices the slabs from the bottom, either the carrier or the supporting means being moveable, horizontally, in a linear direction, and the vertical axes pass¬ing through the centers of rotation of the blades being spaced from each other, whereby the combined effect of the rotating blades, during the relative movement between the carrier and the supporting means, is to slice the slabs, fully through, from top and bottom, along the same vertical plane.<br>
This invention will now be described with refer¬ence to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example one of its various possible embodiments, wherein<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the embodiment in front elevation<br>
and Fig.2  illustrates a separate view of  the slab carrier and a pair of saw blades.<br>
The stone slab carrier C is intended for receiving the stone slabs S therein. The carrier C is provided with means for clamping the slabs in place. One of possible forms of such means com¬prise side plates P, which are moveable towards or away from each other to accommodate "the slabs on the carrier and clamp them in place. The plates are rendered movable towards or away from each other by actuators A coupled (by threaded engage¬ment) to a manually ratable handle bar H.  By<br>
rotating the handle bar H in either direction, the actuators are moved away from, or towards, each other, to open out, or close in, the plates P.<br>
At least one pair of power driven circular saw blades are mounted on supporting means such that one blade Bl of the pair slices the slabs from the top, while the other blade B2 of the pair slices the slabs from the bottom.   In the embodiment<br><br>
illustrated, the supporting means comprise the machine housing M with shafts Tl and T2 on which the saw blades are fixed. The floor of the carrier C is provided with a cleft at K for allowing the lower blade B2 to pass there through and slice the slabs from the bottom.<br>
Either the carrier C or the said supporting means are moveable, horizontally, in a linear direction so that there is a relative movement between the saw blades and the slabs, necessary for the slic¬ing operation. Whenever the carrier, is to be rendered moveable it will be made in the form of a trolley movable on wheels R, which will be manual¬ly operable or power driven by means such as a winch and cable drawing the trolley on a track. Similarly, when the supporting- means are to be rendered moveable, such means will have a base resting on wheels whereby the supporting means can be manually operable or power driven to be ren¬dered moveable along a track.<br>
The vertical axes VI and V2 passing through the centres of rotation of the upper and lower blades Bl  and  B2 are spaced (see double arrow  J)  from<br><br>
each other, whereby the combined effect of the rotating blades, during the relative movement between the carrier and the supporting means will be to slice the slabs from top and bottom, through and through, along the same vertical plane. The offset indicated by J can be altered according to requirements by altering the position of the saw blades Bl and B2, horizontally.<br>
The saw blades Bl and B2 will be rotatably driven in opposed angular directions e.g. as indicated by the arrows Fl and F2 in Fig.2 such that the rota¬tion of the blades assists the relative movement of the slabs S in the direction of the arrow F3.<br>
Alternatively,  if for any reason, it is  required<br>
&gt;<br>
to rotate the blades in a direction resisting the relative movement of the slabs, the blades may be driven in the reverse opposed angular directions indicated by the arrows El and E2.<br>
Normally, the machine proposed herein will be able to accomplish the slicing operation in a single pass, unlike multiple passes required by conven¬tional  machines.  However, in the case of  tough<br><br>
stones such as granite, multiple passes may be required to be executed. In such event, while the slicing operation is carried out,. as it will be necessary to cut deeper and deeper into the slabs, after each pass, the supporting means will be operable to move the upper and lower saw blades Bl and B2 towards each other to achieve the re¬quired cutting depths.<br>
It will be appreciated that in the machine pro¬posed it is possible to have a plurality of pairs of blades for slicing slabs accommodated in the same carrier or in a separate carrier or carriers and such pairs of blades, together with the carri¬er or carriers, can be disposed on either or both sides of the said machine. Reference may be made to Fig.l wherein another pair of blades 83 and 84 are depicted on the other side of the machine, by way of illustration. LI L2 are domes for spraying coolant e.g. water on the blades Bl and B2.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and<br><br>
expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the machine proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this inven¬tion.<br><br><br>
