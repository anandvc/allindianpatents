The novel compounds of the invention are ACE inhibitors inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to the pressor substance angiotensin II and thus decrease blood pressure in mammals. Furthermore, compounds of the invention demonstrate inhibition of NEP and thus potentiate the cardiovascular (e.g.. diuretic and natriuretic) effects of atrial natriuretic factors (ANF). The combined effect is beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders in mammals, in particular, hypertension, cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure, and renal failure. A further beneficial effect of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of said cardiovascular disorders is the inhibition of ECE.<br>
The above-cited properties are demonstrable in vitro and in v/vo tests, using advantageously mammals, e.g., mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, or isolated organs, tissues and preparations thereof. Said compounds can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g., preferably aqueous solutions, and in vivo either enterally, parenterally, advantageously, orally (p.o.) or intravenously (i.v.). e.g., as a suspension or in aqueous solution. The dosage in vitro may range between about lO"* molar and 10'^ molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 0.01 and 50 mg/kg. advantageously between about 0.1 and 25 mg/kg.<br>
In vitro testing is most appropriate for the free carboxylic acids of the invention. The test compound is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol or 0.25 M sodium bicarbonate solution, and the solution is diluted with buffer to the desired concentration.<br>
The in vitro inhibition of the ACE by the compounds of this invention can be demonstrated by a method analogous to that given in Biochem. Phamnacol., Vol. 20. p. 1637 (1971). The buffer for the ACE assay is 300 mM NaCI, 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 8.3). The reaction is initiated by the addition of 100 µL of hippuryl-histidyWeucine (2 mg/mL) to tubes containing enzyme and drug in a volume of 150 µL and tubes are incubated for 30 minutes<br><br>
at 37°C. The reaction is temninated by the addition of 0.75 mL 0.6 N NaOH. 100 µL of freshly prepared 0-pthaldehyde solution (2 mg/mL in methanol) is added to the tubes, the contents are mixed and allowed to stand at room temperature. After 10 minutes, 100 µL of 6 N HCI is added. The tubes are centrifuged and the supernatant optical density is read at 360 nM. The results are plotted against drug concentration to determine the IC50, i.e., the drug concentration which gives half the activity of the control sample containing no drug.<br>
Typically, the compounds of invention demonstrate an IC50 in the range of about 0.1-50 nM for ACE inhibition.<br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compound of Example 6(a) demonstrates an IC50 of about 20 nM in the ACE in vitro assay.<br>
Inhibition of ACE can be demonstrated in vivo on p.o. or i,v. administration by measuring inhibition of the angiotensin I induced pressor response in normotensive rats.<br>
The in vivo test for i.v. administered compounds is performed with male, normotensive rats, which are conscious anesthetized with sodium metofan. A femoral artery and femoral vein are cannulated respectively for direct blood pressure measurement on i.v. administration of angiotensin I and i.v. or p.o. administration of a compound of this invention. After the basal blood pressure is stabilized, pressor responses to 3 or 4 challenges of 300 ng/kg angiotensin I i.v., at 15 minute intervals, are obtained. Such pressure responses are usually again obtained at 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes, and then every hour up to 6 hours after i.v. or p.o. administration of the compound to be tested, and compared with the initial responses. Any observed decrease of said pressor response is an indication of ACE inhibition.<br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compound of Example 6(a) inhibits the angiotensin I induced pressor response for 3 hours at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. Similarly, the compound of Example 1(a) inhibits the angiotensin I induced pressor response for 6 hours at a dose of 11.8 mg/kg p.o.<br>
The in vitro inhibition of NEP (EC 3.4.24.11) can be determined as follows:<br>
NEP 3.4.24.11 activity is detennined by the hydrolysis of the substrate glutaryl·Ala-Ala-Phe-2-naphthylamide (GAAP) using a modified procedure of Orlowskl and Wilk (1981). The incubation mixture (total volume 125 µL) contains 4.2 µL of protein (rat kidney cortex membranes prepared by method of Maeda et al., 1983), 50 mM tris buffer, pH 7.4 at 25**C,<br><br>
500 µM substrate (final concentration), and leucine aminopeptidase M (2.5 µg). The mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at 25**C, and 100 µL of fast garnet (250 µg fast garnet/mL of 10% Tween 20 in 1 M sodium acetate pH 4.2) is added. Enzyme activity is measure spectrophotometrically at 540 nm mM. One unit of NEP 24.11 activity is defined as 1 nmol of 2-naphthylamine released per minute at 25**C at pH 7.4. IC50 values are determined, i.e.. the concentration of test compound required for 50% inhibition of the release of 2-naphthylamine.<br>
NEP activity can also be determined using ANF as a substrate. ANF degrading activity is determined by measuring the disappearance of rat-ANF (r-ANF) using a 3-minute reverse phase-HPLC separation. An aliquot of the enzyme in 50 mM tris HCI buffer, pH 7.4, is pre-incubated at 37**C for 2 minutes and the reaction is initiated by the addition of 4 nmol of r-ANF in a total volume of 50 µL. The reaction is temriinated after 4 minutes with the addition of 30 µL of 0.27% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). One unit of activity is defined as the hydrolysis of 1 nmol of r-ANF per minute at 37**C at pH 7.4. IC50 values are determined, i.e., the concentration of test compound required for 50% inhibition of the hydrolysis of ANF.<br>
Typically, the compounds of the invention demonstrate an IC50 in the range of about 0.1-50 nM for NEP inhibition.<br>
Illustrative of the invention, the compound of Example 6(a) demonstrates an IC50 of about 5 nM in the GAAP in vitro assay.<br>
The effect of the compounds of the invention on rat plasma ANF concentration can be determined as follows:<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (275-390 g) are anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg)/acepromazine (10%) and instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery and vein to obtain blood samples and infuse ANF, respectively. The rats are tethered with a swivel system and are allowed to recover for 24 hours before being studied in the conscious, unrestrained state.<br>
In the assay, plasma ANF levels are determined in the presence and absence of NEP inhibition. On the day of study, all rats are infused continuously with ANF at 450 ng/kg/min. i.v. for the entire 5 hours of the experiment Sixty minutes after beginning the infusion, blood samples for baseline ANF measurements are obtained (time 0) and the rats are then randomly divided into groups treated with the test compound or vehicle.

The anti-hypertensive activity can be determined, e.g.. in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the DOCA-salt hypertensive rat, e.g., according fo Bazil et al., J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol.. Vol. 22. pp. 897-905 (1993) and Trapani et al., J. Cardiovasc. Phamiacol., Vol. 14. pp. 419-424 (1989). respectively.<br>

The anti-hypertensive effect can be determined in desoxy-corticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats as follows:<br>
DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (280-380 g) are prepared by the standard method. Rats undergowent a unilateral nephrectomy and one week later are implanted with silastic pellets containing 100 mg/kg of DOCA. The rats are maintained on 1% of NaCI/0.2% KCI drinking water for three to five weeks until sustained hypertension is established. The anti-hypertensive activity is evaluated at this time.<br><br>
Two days before an experiment, the rats are anesthetized with methoxyflurane and instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery to measure arterial blood pressure. Forty-eight hours later, baseline arterial pressure and heart rate are recorded during a one hour period. The test compound or vehicle is then administered and the same cardiovascular parameters are monitored for an additional 5 hours.<br>
The diuretic (saluretic) activity can be determined in standard diuretic screens, e.g., as described in "New Anti-hypertensive Drugs", Spectrum Publications, pp. 307-321 (1976), or by measuring the potentiation of ANF-induced natriuresis and diuresis in the rat.<br>
The potentiation of the natriuretic effect of ANF can determined as follows:<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-360 g) are anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg i.p.) and instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery, femoral vein and urinary bladder to measure arterial pressure, administer ANF and collect urine, respectively. A continuous infusion of normal saline (33 µL/min.) is maintained throughout the experiment to promote diuresis and sodium excretion. The experimental protocol consists of an initial 15-minute collection period (designated as pre-control) followed by three additional collection periods. Immediately after completion of the pre-control period, test compound or vehicle is administered; nothing is done for the next 45 minutes. Then, blood pressure and renal measurements are obtained during a second collection period (designated control, 15 minutes). At the conclusion of this period. ANF is administered (1 µg/kg i.v. bolus) to all animals and arterial pressure and renal parameters are determined during two consecutive 15-minute collection periods. Mean arterial pressure, urine flow and urinary sodium excretion are determined for all collection periods. Blood pressure is measured with a Gould p5O pressure transducer, urine flow is determined gravimetrically. sodium concentration is measured by flame photometry, and urinary sodium excretion is calculated as the product of urine flow and urine sodium concentration.<br>
The in vitro inhibition of ECE can be determined as follows:<br>
ECE is partially purified from porcine primary aortic endothelial cells by DE52 anion exchange column chromatography and its activity is quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as described in Anal. Biochem.. Vol.. 212. pp. 434-436 (1993). Alternatively, the native enzyme can be substituted by a recombinant form of ECE, as described, for example, in Cell, Vol. 78, pp. 473-485 (1994). Human ECE-1 has been described by several groups (Schmidt et al.. FEBS Letters, Vol. 356, pp. 238-243 (1994); Kaw et al.. 4th Int. Conf. on Endothelin; April 23-25, London (UK) (1995) C6; Valdenaire et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 270,<br><br>
pp. 29794-29798 (1995); Shimada at al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., Vol. 207, pp. 807-812 (1995)). The ECE inhibition can be determined as described in Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int., Vol. 31. No. 5, pp. 861-867 (1993), by RIA to measure ET-1 formed from big ET-1.<br>
Alternatively, recombinant human ECE-1 (rhECE-1) can be used, as follows:<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing rhECE-1 (Kaw et al., 4th Int. Conf. on Endothelin; April 23-25, London (UK), (1995) C6) are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic. Cells are harvested by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, and homogenized at 4°C in a buffer containing 5 mM MgCI2. 1 µM pepstatin A, 100 µM leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0. with a ratio of 2 mL of buffer/mL of cells. The cell debris is removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant is centrifuged again at 100,000 x g for 30 minutes. The resulting pellet is re-suspended in a buffer containing 200 mM NaCI and 50 mM Tes, pH 7.0, at a protein concentration about 15 mg/mL and stored in aliquots at -8O**C.<br>
To assess the effect of an inhibitor on ECE-1 activity, 10 µg of protein is pre-incubated with the compound at a desired concentration for 20 minutes at room temperature in 50 mM TES, pH 7.0, and 0.005% Triton X-100 in a volume of 10 µL. Human big ET-1 (5 µL) is then added to a final concentration of 0.2 µM. and the reaction mixture is further incubated for 2 hours at 37**C. The reaction is stopped by adding 500 µL of RIA buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline.<br>
Diluted samples (200 µL) obtained from the above enzyme assay are incubated at 4X overnight with 25 µL each of ['^^l]ET-1 (10.000 cpm/tube) and 1:20,000-fold diluted rabbit antibodies that recognize specifically the carboxyl tenninal tryptophan of ET-1. Goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to magnetic beads (70 µg) are then added to each tube, and the reaction mixture is further incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The beads are pelleted using a magnetic rack. The supematant is decanted, and the radioactivity in the pellet is counted in a gamma counter. Total and nonspecific binding are measured in the absence of non-radioactive ET-1 and anti-ET antibodies, respectively. Under these conditions, ET-1 and big ET-1 displace [^^^l]ET-1 binding to the antibodies with IC50 values of 21 ± 2 and 260,000 ± 66,000 fmol (mean ± SEM. n = 3-5). respectively.<br><br>
In order to determine the IC50 value of an inhibitor, a concentration-response curve of each inhibitor is determined. An IBM-compatible version of ALLFIT program is used to fit data to a one-site model.<br>
ECE inhibition can also be determined in vivo by measuring the inhibition of big ET-1-induced pressor response in the anesthesized or conscious rat, as described below. The effect of the inhibitors on the pressor response resulting from big ET-1 challenge is measured in Sprague-Dawley rats as described in Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int., Vol. 31, No. 5, pp. 861-867 (1993). Results are expressed as percent inhibition of the big ET-1-induced pressor response as compared to vehicle.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg i.p.) and instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery and vein to record mean arterial pressure (MAP) and administer compounds, respectively. A tracheostomy is performed and a cannula inserted into the trachea to ensure airway patency. The body temperature of the animals is maintained at 37 ± I°C by means of a heating blanket. Following surgery, MAP is allowed to stabilize before intenrupting autonomic neurotransmission with chlorisondamine (3 mg/kg i.v.). Rats are then treated with the test compound at 10 mg/kg i.v. or vehicle and challenged with big ET-1 (1 nmol/kg i.v.) 15 and 90 minutes later. Generally, the data are reported as the maximum increase in MAP produced by big ET-1 in animals treated with the test compound or vehicle.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized with methohexital sodium (75 mg/kg i.p.) and instrumented with catheters in the femoral artery and vein to measure MAP and administer drugs, respectively. The catheters are threaded through a swivel system that enables the rats to move freely after regaining consciousness. The rats are allowed to recover from this procedure for 24 hours before initiating the study. On the following day, MAP is recorded via the femoral artery catheter and a test compound or vehicle is administered via the femoral vein. Animals are challenged with big ET-1 at 1 nmol/kg i.v. at various times after dosing. After an adequate washout period, depending upon the dose and regimen, animals can be re-tested at another dose of test compound or vehicle. Generally, the data are reported as the change in MAP produced by big ET-1 at 2-minute intervals in animals treated with the test compound as compared to vehicle.<br>
ECE inhibition can also be determined in vivo by measuring the inhibition of the big ET-1 induced pressor response in conscious SHR, e.g. as described in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., Vol. 204, pp. 407-412 (1994).<br><br>
Male SHR (16-18 weeks of age) are administered either test compound or vehicle (1 M NaHCO3) via an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously. On day 5, femoral arterial and venous catheters are placed in anesthetized rats for the measurement of MAP and for test compound administration, respectively. After a 48-hour recovery period, MAP is recorded (day 7) through the arterial catheter connected to a pressure transducer. Blood pressure and heart rate are allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes before ganglion blockade is performed using chlorisondamine (10 mg/kg i.v.)· Approximately 15 minutes later, a bolus dose of big ET-1 (0.25 nmol/kg i.v.) is administered to both vehicle- and test compound-treated rats. The change in blood pressure in response to big ET-1 is then compared between the two groups of rats.<br>
The inhibition of cerebral vasospasm is demonstrated by measuring the inhibition of experimentally induced constriction of basilar cerebral arteries in the rabbit (Caner et al.. J. Neurosurg.. Vol. 85, pp. 917-922 (1996).<br>
