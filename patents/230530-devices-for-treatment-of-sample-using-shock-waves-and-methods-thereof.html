The main objective of the present invention is to develop device for treatment of sample using shock waves. The samples are used preferably in agricultural sciences. The treatment involves applications such as<br>
•	Modification of plant physiological process using shock waves.<br>
•	Inducing genetic transformations in prokaryotic/plant systems using shock waves.<br>
•	Hardening of crop plant seeds/seedlings using shock waves.<br><br>
•	Designing and fabrication of modular shock tubes for preservative treatment to seeds and increasing oil extraction efficiently.<br>
•	Reduction in oil extraction time and enhancement of oil extraction from seeds.<br>
The shock wave based techniques/devices are inherently non-intrusive in nature. The strength of shock wave in terms of both the pressure and temperature behind the wave is extremely repeatable and as a result the technical robustness of the devices is very satisfactory. We have successfully developed the following shock wave based techniques in the Shock Waves Laboratory in collaboration with dept. of Crop Physiology. University of Agricultural sciences, Bangalore<br>
The devices developed are cost effective, easy to handle, user friendly and efficient. These features of the devices/techniques for treating of sample using shock waves further enhance their commercially viability.<br>
Based on the current studies, the optimum pressure levels where the application has been found to be successful is around 100 bars. The pressure level behind the shock wave are suitably altered to develop many new applications such as breaking crop plant seed dormancy, seed treatment to reduce storage pests and diseases, disinfections of processed agricultural products and enhancement of extractable compounds from agricultural products.<br>
The invention is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, these examples should not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Device for treatment of sample using shock waves<br>
The schematic diagram of the underwater non-linear pressure wave generator is shown in l;igure 1. The two metallic electrodes are placed at a close distance of about 1mm from one another. A high voltage source for the device comprises a high voltage step-up transformer (25KV/130 mAJ, diode array for rectification and a high voltage capacitor (0.32 microfarad). The AC supply voltage is stepped up and thereafter rectification is<br><br>
used for charging the capacitor. The stored energy from the high voltage capacitor is discharged for depositing electrical energy instantaneously in water which results in the formation of a non-iinear spherical pressure pulse in the vicinity of electrodes. The samples in both liquid and solid form are placed above the electrodes at close distances ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm from the electrodes for pressure wave loading of the samples. By altering the applied voltage between the electrodes, the strength of the non-linear pressure wave is varied ranging from abut 60 bars to about 100 bar lasting about 8 microseconds to 10 microseconds depending on the need of the application.<br>
Example 2<br>
Device for treatment of sample using shock waves<br>
The vertical lube as shown in Figure 2 is made out of stainless steel measuring about 50 mm in diameter and with the length of two sections each measuring about 1.5 m. The wall thickness of the tube is about 10 mm comprises of a high pressure section (driver section) and a low pressure sections (driven section). These driver section and driven section are separated by a thin metal diaphragm. The driver section is pressurized using commercial pressure vessels. The driver section is pressurized at levels ranging from about 20 bars to about 30 bars for about 1 millisecond to the desired pressure while filling the driven section with the desired bio-fluid. Once the pressure in the driver section exceeds the desired pressure then the metal diaphragm ruptures instantaneously resulting in the generation of non-linear planar pressure wave that travels in the driven section of the tube. These non-linear planar pressure waves accelerates in the driven section and creates a pocket of high pressure with high temperature at the end of the lube. 1 he sample thus placed inside the driven section is treated by the instantaneous shock waves having high pressure and high temperature. The strength of the non-linear pressure waves is varied by altering length of the driver and driven sections as well as by using appropriate metal diaphragms.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
