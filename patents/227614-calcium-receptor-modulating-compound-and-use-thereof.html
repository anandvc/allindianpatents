				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CALCIUM RECEPTOR MODULATING COMPOUND AND USE THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic<br>
compounds having calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR,<br>
hereinafter simply referred to as Ca receptor) modulating<br>
(agonistic or antagonistic) activity, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing them and intermediate compounds<br>
useful for synthesizing them.<br>
Background Art<br>
Calcium ion (hereinafter simply referred to as Ca)<br>
plays an essential role to maintain and modulate functions<br>
of various cells such as endocrine and exocrine cells, etc.,<br>
in addition to nerve and muscle. For this reason, the<br>
blood Ca level is strictly maintained in a narrow range.<br>
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a central role in<br>
maintaining this blood Ca level. Therefore, secretion of<br>
PTH from parathyroid gland responds sharply to change in<br>
the blood Ca level and is must be modulated according to<br>
this. In fact, when the blood Ca level is changed, the<br>
blood PTH level is rapidly changed in response to this.<br><br>
The possibility of a mechanism by which the extracellular<br>
Ca concentration is sensed by parathyroid gland cells and<br>
the information transmitted into cells has been pointed out<br>
early by Brown et al. In 1993, they succeeded in the<br>
cloning and characterization of a Ca-sensing receptor<br>
(CaSR; hereinafter, simply referred to as Ca receptor) from<br>
bovine parathyroid (Nature, 366, 575-580(1993)).<br>
The Ca receptor is composed of a large terminal<br>
extracellular region spanning 600 amino acids at the N-<br>
terminal, having seven transmembrane spanning domains like<br>
other G protein coupled receptors, and an intracellular<br>
region consisting of 200 or less amino acids at the caboxyl<br>
C-terminal.<br>
It is considered that, when the extracellular Ca<br>
concentration is increased, phospholipase (PL)-C is<br>
activated, leading to increase in the intracellular Ca<br>
concentration and inhibition of PTH secretion due to<br>
increase in inositol triphosphate (IP3) . Since when a high<br>
value of the extracellular Ca concentration is maintained,<br>
the intracellular Ca concentration is thereafter increased<br>
continuously, it is considered that influx of Ca from the<br>
outside of a cell is also promoted. PL-A2 and D are<br>
activated due to increase in extracellular Ca, but there is<br>
a possibility that these are via protein kinase (PK)-C and<br>
the like which are activated at the same time via Ca<br><br>
receptor. The Ca receptor also inhibits adenylyl cyclase<br>
via Gi protein or via arachidonic acid production due to<br>
activation of PL-A2 and decreases intracellular cyclic AMP<br>
(Bone, 20, 303-309 (1997)).<br>
Ca receptor mRNA is expressed in many tissues, and the<br>
expression amount is high, in parathyroid gland, thyroid<br>
gland C cell, medulla and cortex thick ascending limb (MTAL<br>
and CTAL) of kidney uriniferous tubule, intramedullary<br>
collecting tubule (IMCD) and encephalic subfornical organ<br>
(SFO) and hippocampus (Bone, 20, 303-309 (1997)). In<br>
addition, expression is recognized in many tissues such as<br>
encephalic hypothalamus, cerebellum and olfactory nucleus,<br>
regions other than TAL of renal uriniferous tubule, lung,<br>
stomach, pancreas, intestine and skin. Since the Ca<br>
receptor is present in various tissues, its physiological<br>
function has yet to be fully understood. However, it is<br>
expected that the Ca receptor modulating (agonistic or<br>
antagonistic) drug would provide for a novel treatment of<br>
various disease states which include the following:<br>
1. Drugs for Treating Bone Diseases<br>
Since the anabolic activity is manifested by<br>
intermittent administration of PTH, Ca receptor modulating<br>
drugs which are considered to be able to regulate secretion<br>
of PTH are promising as a drug for treating osteoporosis.<br>
In addition, Ca receptor modulating drugs which are<br><br>
selectable for thyroid gland C cell may be also effective<br>
for treating osteoporosis by stimulation of calcitonin<br>
secretion. Whether the same Ca receptor as that of<br>
parathyroid gland is present in osteoblast, osteoclast and<br>
bone cell or not is disputable. However, some Ca-sensing<br>
mechanism is assuredly present therein and, therefore,<br>
drugs which directly act on them can be expected as a drug<br>
for treating bone diseases.<br>
2.	Kidney-Acting Drugs<br>
Handling of water and mineral in kidney is not only<br>
based on the results of function as a target organ for<br>
hormones, such as PTH, vitamin D etc., but also the Ca<br>
receptor in kidney is presumed to function in a response to<br>
the Ca concentration and the magnesium ion concentration in<br>
the extracellular fluid (Kidney Int, 50, 2129-2139 (1996)).<br>
Further, it is also considered that Ca receptor modulating<br>
drugs may modulate the blood amount in kidney, the amount<br>
of glomerulus filtration, renin secretion and activation of<br>
vitamin D in addition to control of influx and efflux of<br>
water and mineral.<br>
3.	Central Nervous System and Endocrine-Acting Drugs<br>
Ca receptor is present in almost all areas in the<br>
central nervous system, and is remarkably expressed, in<br>
particular, in the hippocampus, cerebellum and subfornical<br>
organ (Brain Res, 744. 47-56 (1997)). Although the details<br><br>
of the function are still unclear, the term of Ca receptor<br>
expression after birth in the hippocampus is consistent<br>
with the term of acquisition of LTP (Long Tightening<br>
Phenomenon) (Develop Brain Res, 100, 13-21 (1997)) and,<br>
therefore, the relationship with memory and learning can be<br>
presumed. Therefore, Ca receptor modulating drugs which<br>
are high in brain-blood barrier permeability and selective<br>
for the central nerve system may be utilized for treating<br>
Alzheimer's disease. In addition, since dry mouth occurs<br>
in hypercalcemic patient, Ca receptor modulating drugs may<br>
control them. The presence of Ca receptor in mouse<br>
pituitary gland cells which secreteACTH has been reported<br>
(Mol Endocrinol, 10, 555-565 (1996)). It is also<br>
considered that Ca receptor modulating drugs can be applied<br>
to Sheehann's syndrome and hypopituitarism or<br>
hyperpituitarism.<br>
4. Digestive System-Acting Drugs<br>
It is considered that a Ca receptor is present in the<br>
Auerbach nerve plexus of the digestive tract and controls<br>
intestinal tract motion. Constipation is known in<br>
hypercalcemic patients and stimulation of digestive tract<br>
motion is known in hypocalcemic patients in clinical tests.<br>
The existence of a Ca receptor in the gastrin secreting<br>
cell (G cell) of the stomach has been reported (J. Clin<br>
Invest, 99, 2328-2333 (1997)), and intestinal tract<br><br>
absorption, constipation, diarrhea, defecation and<br>
secretion of acid in the stomach may be controlled by drugs<br>
which act on a Ca receptor in the digestive tract. Further,<br>
it has been found that a Ca receptor is present in human<br>
colon cancer cell strains and it controls c-myc expression<br>
and proliferation (Biochem Biophys Res Commum, 232, 80-83<br>
(1997)), this is better consistent with the fact that the<br>
Ca uptake and sideration of colon and rectum cancers<br>
exhibit the negative correlation and, therefore, Ca<br>
receptor regulating drugs can be expected also as a drug<br>
for preventing and treating such cancers.<br>
Various heterocyclic compounds have been disclosed in<br>
the prior art. For example, WO 01/53266 discloses a<br>
compound of the formula:<br><br>
where in R, R1 and R2 are independently H, hydroxyl, etc.<br>
This compound has a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitory<br>
activity and is useful for treating coronary obstruction,<br>
etc. Indian J. Chem., Sect. B (1993), 32B(5), 586-9<br>
discloses the synthesis of a compound of the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, chlorine, methyl or methoxy.<br>
However, no utility is disclosed. U.S. Patent 4,746,656<br>
(JP 63-33380 A) discloses a compound of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is aryl or heterocyclic group, R2 is aryl, etc.,<br>
R3 and R4 are independently H, alkyl, etc. This compound<br>
is a Ca channel blocker.<br>
EP 217142 discloses a compound of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl, etc., R1 is hydrogen, nitro,<br>
cyano, etc., R2 is phenyl, cycloalkyl, etc., R3 is hydrogen,<br><br>
acyl etc., and R8is carboxyl, carbamoyl, etc. This<br>
compound is also a Ca channel blocker.<br>
However, a heterocyclic compound having Ca receptor<br>
modulating activity is not found in the prior art.<br>

One object of the present invention is to provide<br>
compounds having Ca receptor modulating activity including<br>
novel compounds.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>

These objects as well as other objects and advantages<br>

or ethers (diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane etc.) are<br>

appropriately selected depending on a kind of a carboxyl-<br>
protecting group and an elimination method. Elimination<br>

trifluoride), tetrahalogenated titanium (e.g. titanium<br>
tetrachloride and titanium tetrabromide), and halogenated<br>
aluminium (e.g. aluminium chloride and aluminium bromide),<br>
or an organic acid (e.g. trichloroacetic acid and<br>
trifluoroacetic acid). This elimination reaction is<br>

scavenger (e.g. anisole and phenol) and is usually carried<br>
out in a solvent such as nitroalkane (e.g. nitromethane and<br>
nitroethane), alkylene halide (e.g., methylene chloride and<br>

Examples of a reduction method using in the present<br>
elimination reaction include the conventional catalytic<br>
reduction in the presence of a combination of a metal (e.g.<br>
zinc and zinc amalgam) or a salt of a chromium compound<br>
(e.g. chromate chloride and chromate acetate) and an<br>
organic or inorganic acid (e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid<br>
and hydrochloric acid); or the conventional metal catalyst<br>
(e.g. palladium carbon and Raney nickel). A reaction<br>
temperature is not particularly limited, but a reaction is<br><br>
carried out under cooling, at room temperature of under<br>
warming.<br>

Strategy for cloning of the cDNAs encoding the human<br>
CaR<br>
Strategy for cloning of the cDNAs encoding the human<br>
CaR is shown below. To amplify the cDNA encoding the N-<br>
terminal moiety of the human CaR, the synthetic DNA primers,<br>
Cal-U : 5'-AGAGTCGACGCCACCATGGCATTTTATAGCTGCTGCTGG-3' and<br>
Cal-L : 5'-AAATGAGCTCTCGGTTGGTGGCCTTGAC-3' , were constructed.<br>
In this case, SalI site was added at the 5' end of<br>
amplified cDNA. To amplify the cDNA encoding the C-terminal<br>
moiety of the human CaR, the synthetic DNA primers, Ca2-U :<br>
5'-AAACGAGCTCTCCTACCTCCTCCTCTTC-3' and Ca2-L : 5'-<br>
TCTGCGGCCGCTCCCTAGCCCAGTCTTCTCCTTCC-3', were constructed.<br>
In this case, NotI site was added at the 3' end of<br>
amplified cDNA. PCR was carried out by Hot Start method.<br>
The reaction solution of the upper phase was added of 1 pg<br>
of the human kidney-derived cDNA (TOYOBO), 0.3 mM dNTPs and<br>
2.5 unit LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara shuzo co.) and<br>
filled up to 30 µl with water and buffer attached to the<br>
enzyme. To the reaction solution of the lower phase was<br>
added 12.5 uM each of the synthetic primers and 0.5 mM<br>
dNTPs and filled up to 20 µl with water and buffer attached<br>
to the enzyme. The reaction solution of the upper phase was<br>
added on the lower phase covered with an AmpliWax PCR<br>
Gem100 (Takara Shuzo Co.). The samples were subject to PCR<br>
amplification using a Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Co.).<br><br>
The amplified cDNAs were confirmed by agarose gel<br>
electrophoresis.<br>
Experiment 2<br>
Preparation of CaR-expression CHO cells<br>
The PCR products obtained in Experiment 1 were<br>
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products<br>
were excised and purified from the gel and subcloned into<br>
pT7Blue-T vector (Takara Shuzo Co.). The cDNA fragment<br>
encoding the N-terminal moiety of the human CaR was<br>
released from the subcloned pT7Blue-T vector treated with<br>
SalI and SacI. The cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal<br>
moiety of the human CaR was released from the subcloned<br>
pT7Blue-T vector treated with SacI and NotI. Using DNA<br>
Ligation kit (Takara Shuzo Co.), these fragments were<br>
inserted between the site of SalI- and NotI- in the<br>
digested pMSRαneo vector. Thus, the pMSRαneo-CaR for animal<br>
cell expression was constructed.<br>
Ten ug of the pMSRαneo-CaR was added to the solution<br>
containing 8xl06 CH0-K1 cells, and transfection was carried<br>
out using Gene Pulser (0.4cm cuvette, 0.25kV, 960mF) (Bio-<br>
Rad Laboratories). The cells were cultured in HamF12<br>
containing 10% fetal calf serum for one day. After passage,<br>
the cells were cultured in HamF12 containing 10% fetal and<br>
500ug/ml Genetisine. The cells were seeded on 96-well plate<br><br>
in 1x103 cells/well and transformants, CaR-expressing CHO<br>
cells, were selected in the selection medium.<br>
Experiment 3<br>
Selection of the CaR-expressing CHO cell line by-<br>
calcium mobilization assay<br>
A method for calcium mobilization assay is shown below.<br>
The CaR-expressing CHO cells were seeded on a 96-well white<br>
plate in 2xl04 cells/well, followed by cultivation for 48<br>
hours. After washing the cells with Phosphate-Buffered<br>
Saline, 100 µl of buffer solution (120 mM NaCl, 22 mM<br>
NaHCO3, 6 mM KCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 5<br>
mM HEPES (pH 7.4)) containing 5 uM FuraPE3AM (Texas<br>
Fluorescence Laboratories) was added to the wells and kept<br>
at 37 °C for 1 hour. The cells were washed twice with<br>
Phosphate-Buffered Saline. After adding 180 ul of the<br>
reaction buffer solution (130 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.2 mM<br>
CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4))<br>
to the wells, 20 ul of 60 mM CaCl2 was added and<br>
intracellular calcium concentration were measured with a<br>
fluorometric imaging plate reader (FDSS 2000, Hamamatsu<br>
photonics). One clone increasing intracellular calcium<br>
concentration was selected and used for the following<br>
experiment.<br><br>
Experiment 4<br>
GTPγS binding assay<br>
Preparation of membrane fraction is described bellow.<br>
The human CaR-expressing CHO cells were inoculated to a<br>
F500 flask in 1.8xl05 cells/flask followed by cultivation<br>
for 2 days. The cells were scraped with 10ml of Phosphate-<br>
Buffered Saline containing 0.02% EDTA. After centrifugation<br>
(2000 rpm, 10 min) of the cells, the cell pellet was<br>
resuspended into 12 ml of homogenate buffer solution (10 mM<br>
NaHCO3, 1 mM EDTA, lx Protease inhibitor cocktail (pH 7.4))<br>
and homogenized by Polytron™ (20000 rpm, 1 min) . The cell<br>
debris was removed by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 10 min),<br>
and then the CaR-expressing cell membrane fraction was<br>
collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman 70 Ti type rotor,<br>
30000 rpm, 1 hour).<br>
The GTPyS binding activity was measured as follows.<br>
Twenty ug of the CaR-expressing cell membrane was incubated<br>
with test compounds for 10min. The assays were carried out<br>
at room temperature for an hour in a reaction solution<br>
mixture containing 20 mM HEPES (pH.7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM<br>
MgCl2, 167 µg/ml DTT, 5 µM guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 0.4 nM<br>
[35S]-guanosine 5'-(γ-thio) triphosphate ( [35S]-GTPγS) and 6<br>
mM CaCl2. The mixture was filtered through a GF/C filter.<br>
After washing fourth with 300 µl of Phosphate-Buffered<br>
Saline, the amount of [35S]-GTPYS bound to the filter was<br><br>
measured using a Top-count scintillation counter.<br>
Effects of test compounds on [35S]-GTPYS binding were<br>
expressed in percentage terms. This was calculated from the<br>
equation [100x(t'-b)]/(t-b) where t', t and b are values of<br>
[35S]-GTPYS binding (dpm) , t' in the presence of 6mM<br>
calcium and the test compound, t in the presence of 6mM<br>
calcium only and b in the absence of both 6mM calcium and<br>
the test compound.<br>
The antagonist dose-dependently decreased [35S]-GTPYS<br>
binding in membrane preparation. The agonist dose-<br>
dependently increased [35S]-GTPΓS binding in membrane<br>
preparation.<br>
The results are shown in Table 7.<br><br>
