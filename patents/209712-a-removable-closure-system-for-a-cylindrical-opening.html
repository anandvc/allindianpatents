GRANTED<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
A MEMBER REMOVABLY CLOSING A CYLINDRICAL OPENING Background of the Invention<br>
It is frequently necessary to close an opening in a tubular member either permanently or semi-permanently ~ that is, to close an opening where a valve is not required or is not desirable. One example of a semipermanent closure arises when a hot tap is made into a pipeline through a fitting connected to the pipeline. In the typical hot tapping application as 5 utilized in the petroleum industry, a fitting, usually in the form of a flange, is welded on the exterior of a pipeline that has flowing gas or liquid under pressure. A valve is then secured to the flange and a hot tapping machine secured to the valve. By use of highly specialized equipment, a hole can then be drilled through the wall of the pipeline while gas or liquid continues to flow through it. By this means access is provided to the interior of the pipeline,<br>
10 such as for inserting equipment to temporarily block flow through the pipeline while repairs are made. After the repairs are complete, the tapping equipment is removed and the opening that provides communication to the interior of the pipeline needs to be closed. Preferably the closure is made in such a way that at some future date access can again be obtained through the fitting to the interior of the pipeline.   The disclosure herein provides a system for<br>
15   removably closing a tubular fitting, such as the one described.<br>

Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a removable closure system including a tubular member having a cylindrical opening for the passage of tools or for flow of liquids or gases. In a typical application of the invention, the closure may be in the form of a flange, — that is, a 5 tubular member that has an integral radially extending flange portion that is readily adaptable for the attachment of other structural or piping devices. The tubular member has an inner end and an outer end and an internal passageway that is defined by a first cylindrical surface of a first internal diameter adjacent the inner end and a second cylindrical surface of a larger internal diameter adjacent the outer end, the different internal diameters providing an internal<br>
10   circumferential ledge.   The tubular member second cylindrical surface has an increased<br>
internal diameter circumferential groove therein that is spaced from the circumferential ledge.<br>
A cylindrical plug is positioned within the tubular member. The plug has an external<br>
diameter greater than the diameter of the tubular member first cylindrical surface and slightly<br>
less than the diameter of the second cylindrical surface.  The cylindrical plug is thereby<br>
15 telescopically positionable within the tubular member second internal cylindrical surface and in engagement with the circumferential ledge. The cylindrical plug is preferably made to have two external diameters forming an external circumferential ledge that mates against the tubular member internal circumferential ledge.<br>
An expandable snap ring is secured to an upper surface of the cylindrical plug and has<br>
20 a collapsed and an expanded condition. When in the collapsed condition, the snap ring has an external cylindrical diameter less than the diameter of the tubular member second internal cylindrical surface. In its expanded condition, the snap ring fits into the tubular member circumferential groove so that the cylindrical plug is captured between the circumferential ledge and the snap ring. The snap ring is formed of a first and a second leaf portion. Each<br><br><br>
leaf portion is hinged to the plug body adjacent its inner end. A linkage mechanism is . secured to the outer end of each of the leaf portions. By actuation of a linkage mechanism in one direction, the leaf portions are moved radially outwardly with respect to each other to extend within the tubular member circumferential groove to lock the cylindrical plug within 5 the tubular member. By actuation of the linkage mechanism in the opposite direction the leaf portions are moved radially inwardly with respect to each other to withdraw the leaf portions from the tubular member circumferential groove to permit the plug member to be removed from within the tubular member.<br>
In an improved embodiment of the removable closure system, a plug holder has a<br>
10 rotatable actuator directly interconnected with the leaves, When the actuator is rotated in a first direction the leaves are retracted to their collapsed position allowing the plug body to be inserted into or removed from the tubular member passageway and when rotated in the opposite direction the leaves are extended into their expanded positions so that the outer peripheral edge of each leaf extends into the circumferential groove in the tubular member<br>
15 passageway thereby locking the plug body into the passageway. The plug body has a circumferential groove around the lower cylindrical surface that receives an O-ring seal so that when in position within the tubular member, the plug body seals against fluid flow.<br>
In the preferred and illustrated arrangement of the improved removable closure system the actuator moves the leaves between their expanded and contracted positions by<br>
2 0 cam action - that is, boss portions extending from the rotatable actuator fit into cam shaped slots formed in the leaves so that as the actuator is rotated, the leaves are moved radially inwardly or outwardly with respect to the tubular member passageway wall.<br>
A better understanding of the invention will be obtained from the following description of the preferred embodiments and the claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
25   attached drawings.<br><br><br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring first to Figures 1 and 4, the basic components of a removable closure system are illustrated. A tubular member in the form of a flange generally indicated by the numeral 60 has an inner end 62 and an outer end 64. A passageway is formed through the<br>
5' flange, the passageway being defined by a first cylindrical surface 66 and a slightly enlarged second cylindrical surface 68. Since second cylindrical surface 68 is of larger internal diameter than first cylindrical surface 66 an internal circumferential ledge 70 is formed in the passageway.<br>
Flange 60 typically has an integral radially extending flange portion 72 having bolt<br>
0 opening 74 tlierein. However, the invention is applicable to any type of tubular device that needs to be removably closed.<br>
Formed in the second cylindrical surface 68 of the flange above ledge 70 is an increased diameter circumferential groove 76.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 1-7, a plug body has a top surface 90 and an outer<br>
5 circumferential surface that includes external cylindrical surfaces 80 and 82, a circumferential groove 92 and a rubber O-ring 94. The difference in diameters of surfaces 80 and 82 form a circumferential ledge 84. To install or remove the plug member from a flange (the flange being identified by the numeral 60) a plug holder 132 is employed, the plug holder being removably secured to upper surface 90 of the removable plug member by bolts 134.<br>
0	In the embodiment of Figures 1 -7, a first retainer leaf 192 and a second retainer leaf<br>
194 are employed. First retainer leaf 192 has a first end 196 and a second end 198. Adj acent to first end 196 is an opening 200 as seen in Figure 6 that receives a pin 202 that extends into an opening 204 in the top surface 90 of plug body 86. Adjacent the second end 198 of first<br><br>
retainer leaf 192 is an upwardly extending pin 206.<br>
In like manner, second retainer leaf 194 has a first end 208 and a second end 209. Adjacent the first end 208 is an opening 210 (see Figure 6) that receives a pin 212 that extends within an opening 214 in top surface 90 of plug body 86.  Further, an upwardly 5   extending pin 216 is secured to second retainer leaf 194 adjacent the second end 209.<br>
Retainer leaves 192 and 194 can pivot toward and away from each other around hinge<br>
pins 202 and 212 and are guided in sliding position by retainers 126. Each retainer is held<br>
in position on plug member top surface 90 by a bolt 130. Each bolt 130 preferably receives<br>
a lock washer (not illustrated) to insure retention of the leaves on the plug member top<br>
10   surface. Rotation of retainers 126 is prevented by pins 131.<br>
Plug holder 132 receives a cam shaft 140 (best seen in Figure 6) rotatably supported by a bearing 143, Cam shaft 140 has, on the lower end thereof, a cam portion 142. Slidably positioned on the top surface 90 of plug body 86 is a yoke 144 having an elongated slot 147 therein that receives cam portion 142. As cam shaft 140 is rotated, yoke 144 is reciprocally 15 displaced radially inwardly and outwardly as guided by a slot 146 in the bottom of holder body 136.<br>
Radially positioned by yoke 144 is a link plate 120. Specifically, link plate 120 has<br>
upwardly extending pins 218 that are received in openings 220 in a linkage member 148.<br>
Linkage member 148 is secured to the outer end of yoke 144 by means of bolts 152. Thus<br>
20   by means of linkage member 148, link plate 120 is moved inwardly and outwardly on upper<br>
surface 90 of plug body .86 as cam shaft 140 is rotated.<br>
Formed in link plate 120 are first and second elongated slots 222 and 224. Slot 222 slidably receives pin 206 affixed adjacently the second end of first retainer leaf 192 and slot<br><br><br>
WO 02/18835	PCT/US01/26993<br>
224 slidably receives pin 216 affixed adjacently the second end of second retainer leaf 194.<br>
By the connection of pins 206 and 216 to link plate 120, the rotation of cam shaft 140<br>
radially outwardly expands retainer leaves 192 and 194 or radially inwardly contracts the<br>
leaves. Figure 2 shows link plate 120 radially inwardly positioned so that leaves 192 and 194<br>
5   are radially and inwardly retracted in which case all portions of the leaves are internal of the<br>
plug body external cylindrical surface 82. In the condition shown in Figure 2, the plug body<br>
can be inserted into or removed from the interior of flange 60. Figure3 shows link plate 120<br>
radially outwardly positioned, outwardly expanding leaves 192 and 194 to extend beyond<br>
' circumferential surface 82 of plug body 86 so that when the plug body is positioned within<br>
0   flange 60 the leaves extend into circumferential groove 76 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
To radially guide link plate 120, opposed parallel slots 226 and 228 are provided. These slots receive bolts 230 and 232. Slots 226 and 228 are provided with enlarged area recesses adjacent their inner ends as seen in Figures 2 and 6. When the link plate 120 is radially outwardly expanded to the maximum position as illustrated in Figure 3 (which is the<br>
5 condition in which the plug body 86 is in locked position within a flange) bolts 230 and 232 may be downwardly threaded so that the enlarged heads thereof enter into the enlarged recesses in slots 226 and 228 thereby locking link plate 120 in its outward position and correspondingly locking retainer leaves 192 and 194 in their radially outwardly expanded positions. After a plug body 86 has been inserted into a flange 60 and leaves 192 and 194<br>
0 radially outwardly expanded, plug holder 132 can be removed from top surface 90 of the plug body by removing bolts 134.<br>
Before a plug member that has been locked in position within a flange is removed it is important that any pressure applied against the plug member from within the system to<br><br>
which the flange is attached is relieved, otherwise if retainer leaves 192 and 194 are retracted the plug could blow out and injure a workman. Figure 7 shows an embodiment of a pressure relief system. In the embodiment of Figure 7, plug body 86 has a larger diameter opening 162 that communicates with top surface 90 and that receives acylindrical guide member 234. 5 The plug body has a reduced diameter opening 236 extending downwardly toward a bottom surface 238 of the plug member. Reduced opening 236 is flared out into a frusto-conical opening 240 that communicates with a cylindrical lower opening 242. A valve element has a stem portion 244 that is coaxially affixed to the bottom surface of guide 234 by a bolt 246. Stem portion 244 integrally connects with a valve head portion 248 that has a frusto-conical<br>
10 valve sealing surface 250. Received in frusto-conical opening 240 is a circumferential<br>
groove 252 that receives an O-ring 254, A downward force on pin 158 urges valve stem 244 <br>
and thereby valve head 248 to the lower or valve open condition. A spring 255 urges valve<br>
stem 244 and thereby valve head 248 to the upper or valve closed condition.	Yoke 144<br>
has a cylindrical recess in its lower surface that receives cylindrical guide 234 when yoke 144<br>
15 is in its outward position with leaves 192 and 194 radially outwardly extended locking the plug body in position in the flange. When stem 244 is downwardly depressed, thereby downwardly depressing valve head portion 248, pressure within the flange below plug body 86 is relieved. After the pressure is relieved, cam shaft 140 may be rotated to retract leaves 192 and 194 to permit the removal of a plug.<br>
20	Shear pins 180 and 180A (see the upper portion of Figure 6) that extend through<br>
openings 184 and 188 in holder body 136, can, when downwardly extended via spring pins 182 and 182A, enter openings 186 and 190 in yoke 144. Shear pin 180 is received in opening 186 to lock yoke 144 in its outward position - that is, to lock the yoke when leaves 192 and<br><br>
194 are radially outwardly expanded while shear pin 180A when received in opening 190 functions to lock the yoke in the collapsed position in which the leaves are radially inwardly expanded. The shear pins can be sheared by forced rotation of cam shaft 140. The shear pins serve to provide information to the operator that action of the cam shaft (and thereby yoke 5 144) has taken place to either move the leaves to their retracted positions or to move the leaves to their expanded positions.<br>
Figures 8-15 disclose an improved and alternate embodiment of a member for removably closing a cylindrical opening. Figures 8 and 9 are isometric views of the improved closure member.<br>
10 The closure member has a cylindrical body portion with a top surface 90 and with cylindrical walls defined by a first external cylindrical surface 80 and a slightly larger external surface 82. The differences in diameters between the cylindrical surfaces 80 and 82 result in a circumferential ledge 84. An external circumferential groove 92 in cylindrical surface 80 receives a large rubber O-ring 94 that is in the form of a large O-ring.<br>
15	Positioned in a common plane on plug body 86 is a first leaf 258 and a second leaf<br>
260. Leaves 258 and 260 are formed of flat plates and are of the same configuration. Each of the leaves 258 and 260 have a substantially semicircular peripheral edge 262 and each has a substantially straight inner edge 264.<br>
Leaves 258 and 260 are pivotal on plug member top surface 90, each leaf pivoting<br>
2 0 about a pivot pin 266. Pivot pins 266 are bolts extending through openings in the leaves. The leaves are arranged to have collapsed and expanded positions. Figure 8 shows the leaves in their collapsed position in which their circumferential edges 262 are withdrawn within the confines of the external circumferential surface 82 of the plug body.   In the collapsed<br><br>
condition as in Figures 8 and 11, the closure member may be inserted into or removed from a cylindrical opening such as that formed by flange 60 as illustrated in Figures 1, 4 and 5. In the expanded positions of the leaves (as shown in Figure 9) the peripheral edges 262 extend beyond the diameter of the plug body cylindrical surface 82 and when the closure 5 member is positioned within flange 60 of Figures 1,4 and 5, and extends into circumferential groove 76, thereby locking the closure member in position within the flange. Figure 11 is a cross-sectional view showing leaves 258 and 260 in their collapsed positions while Figure 12 shows the leaves in their expanded positions in which the peripheral edges 262 extend within circumferential groove 76.<br>
10	Formed in each of the leaves is an arcuate guide slot 268 that receives a guide bolt<br>
270, the bolts being extended into threaded openings in surface 90 of plug body 86. The heads of bolts 270 maintain leaves 25 8 and 260 in slidable contact with plug body top surface 90. Slots 268 are each formed in an arc relative to pivot pin 266.<br>
The system and method of moving leaves 258 and 260 between their collapsed and<br>
15 expanded positions in the embodiment of the invention in Figures 8-15 is completely different than the embodiment of the invention in Figures 1-7 as has been previously described. As shown most clearly in Figures 8 and 9 each of the leaves 258,260 has formed therein a cam surface slot 272. The cam surface slot in each leaf is eccentric with respect to the axis of pivotation of each leaf- that is, with respect to a pivot pin 266. In a manner<br>
2 0 that will be described subsequently, an actuator has boss portions that engage slots 272 to move the leaves toward and away from each other - that is, to move the leaves between their collapsed and expanded positions.<br>
As further seen in Figures 8 and 9, each leaf 258,260 has a first plug holder bolt slot<br><br>
274, each being arcuate about a pivot pin 266. Further, each leaf has a second plug holder bolt slot 276. Each slot 276 communicates with the straight inner edge 264 of the leaf. The four openings formed in the pair of leaves - that is, slots 274 and 276 and each leaf, making a total of four slots, are not concerned with moving the leaves with respect to each other but 5 provide openings to receive bolts so that a plug holder, as will now be described can be mounted on the plug body. The plug holder is identified generally by the numeral 278 and is seen in Figures 11-15. Plug holder 278 has a flange portion 280 with four bolts 282. The bolts 282 thread into threaded recesses in the plug body top surface 90. Thus there are four threaded recesses 284, a portion of which are seen in Figures 10,11 and 12.<br>
10	As seen in Figure 15, the plug holder flange portion 280 has an opening 286 for each<br>
of bolts 282 and the flange further has, for each opening 286 integral stand-offs 288. These integral tubular stand-offs have lower ends 290 that rest on plug body top surface 90 so that the main flange portion 280 of the plug holder is held above leaves 258 and 260.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 show the plug holder 278 attached to plug body 86 in the condition<br>
15 that exists when the plug body is being inserted into or being removed from flange 60. After the plug body is inserted into flange 60 or any other cylindrical passageway to be closed and leaves 258 and 260 are moved to their expanded positions (as shown in Figure 12) plug holder 278 may be removed by unthreading the four bolts 282, this allows a cover to be placed over the flange.<br>
2 0	Plug holder 278 includes a rotatable actuating portion 292 that is received in an<br>
opening 294 in flange portion 280 (see Figure 15). A bearing 296 provides for the easy rotation of actuating portion 292, Affixed to a lower end of actuating portion 292 is a plate 298 held in place by screws 299 so that actuating portion 292 remains rotatably secure to<br><br>
flange portion 280. Extending downwardly from plate 298 are two opposed boss portions 300. A boss portion 300 extends within the cam surface slots 272 in each of leaves 258 and 260. Cam surface slots 272 are eccentric with respect to the rotational axis of actuating portion 292 of plug holder 278 so that as the actuator portion is rotated the interaction of boss 5 portions 300 and cam surface slots 272 moves leaves 258 and 260 between their collapsed and expanded positions.<br>
As has been previously stated, it is important that for safety reasons that any pressure below the closure member 86 be relieved before effort is made to release the closure member from its sealed position within the interior of a cylindrical opening and for this reason<br>
10 provision is made to open a bypass passageway before leaves 258 and 260 can be retracted from their expanded positions (as shown in Figure 9) to their collapsed positions (as shown in Figure 8). When the leaves are in their expanded positions, a spring bias valve head 248 is moved into a closed position (as seen in Figure 10) closing passageway 236 through plug body 86. The upward movement of valve head 248 and correspondingly stem 244 moves<br>
15 cylindrical guide 234 to an upward position as shown in Figure 9 and in Figure 10. In this upward position, cylindrical guide 234 is positioned between the inner edges 264 of each of the plates thereby preventing the plates from moving from their expanded positions (as shown in Figure 9) to their collapsed positions (as shown in Figure 8). To accommodate cylindrical guide 234, the straight inner edge 264 of each leaf has a shallow depth<br>
20   semicircular recess 302 therein. •<br>
Plug holder actuator portion 292 has a central opening 304 therethrough (see Figures 13 and 15). With plug holder 278 attached to the upper surface of plug body 86 that has been secured within a cylindrical opening, the leaves cannot be moved toward their collapsed<br><br>
positions until action has been taken to alleviate any pressure differentia] across the plug body. A rod 306 is extended downwardly through central opening 304 in plug holder 278 to engage cylindrical guide 234. Downward force on rod 306 depresses central guide 234 and thereby stem 244 having valve head 248 thereon to open a passage for fluid flow through 5 opening 236 in the plug body. The operator will know when flow through this opening ceases thereby indicating that pressure below plug body 86 has been relieved. While holding down on rod 306, depressing cylindrical guide 234, the operator can then rotate plug holder actuator portion 292 to cause leaves 258 and 260 to move toward each other. The operator then may remove the closure member from within the flange thereby fully exposing the<br>
10   opening through the flange for any desired purpose.<br>
The embodiment of Figures 8 through 15 has advantages over the earlier embodiment as illustrated in Figures 1 through 7. One of the significant advantages is the use of leaves 258, 260 that are made of flat plates and that have large surfaces to slide upon the planar upper surface 90 of the plug body. This substantially alleviates any problem of warpage or<br>
15   twisting that can happen with leaves of other configurations.<br>
Further, the system of Figures 8-15 employs direct mechanical coupling for moving the leaves between collapsed and expanded positions that does not require linkages of any kind. In addition, the positive locking of the leaves in their expanded positions does not depend on any linkages that could fail. The system employs a sturdy cylindrical guide 234<br>
2 0 that is directly interposed between peripheral edges of the leaves to ensure that the leaves cannot be retracted to their collapsed positions without the passage through the plug body being open to relieve any pressure across the plug body.<br><br>
The claims and the specification describe the invention presented and the terms that are employed in the claims draw their meaning from the use of such terms in the specification. The same terms employed in the prior art may be broader in meaning than specifically employed herein. Whenever there is a question between the broader definition 5 of such terms used in the prior art and the more specific use of the terms herein, the more specific meaning is meant.<br>
