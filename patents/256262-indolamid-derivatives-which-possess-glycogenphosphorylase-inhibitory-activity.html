				<td>The present invention relates to an indolamide compounds which possess glyeogen phosphorylase activity.<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic amide derivatives pharmacetielly acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof. These haterocychc amide possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with increased glycogen phosphorylase activity and thus arc potentially useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufactuic of said heterocyclic amide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the nunuhiouue 01 medicaments to inhibit glycogen phosphoryJase activity in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
The liver is the major organ regulating glycaemia in the post-absorptive state. Additionally, although having a smaller role in the contribution to post-prandial blood glucose levels, the response of the liver to exogenous sources of plasma glucose is key to an ability to maintain euglycaemia. An increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) is considered to play an important role in maintaining the elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels seen in tjpe 2 diabetics; particularly those with a EPG &gt;140mg/dl (7.8mM). (Weyer et al, (1999), J Clin Invest 104: 787-794; Clore &amp; Blackgard (1994), Diabetes 43: 256-262; DC Fronzo, R. A., et al, (1992) Diabetes Care 15; 318 - 355; Reaven, G.M. (1995) Diabetologia 38; 3-13).<br>
Since current oral, anti-diabetic therapies fail to bring FPG levels to within the normal, non-diabetic range and since raised FPG (and glycHbAlc) levels are risk factors for both macro- (Charles, M.A. et al (1996) Lancet 348, 1657-1658; Coutinho, M. et al (1999) Diabetes Care 22; 233-240; Shaw, J.E. et al (2000) Diabetes Care 23, 34-39) and micro-vascular disease (DCCT Research Group (1993) New. Eng. J. Med. 329; 977-986); the reduction and normalisation of elevated FPG levels remains a treatment goal in type 2 DM.<br>
It has been estimated that, after an overnight fast, 74% of HGO was derived from glycogenolysis with the remainder derived from gluconeogenic precursors (Hellerstein et al (1997) Am J Physiol, 272: E163). Glycogen phosphorylase is a key enzyme in the generation by glycogenolysis of glucose-1-phosphate, and hence glucose in liver and also in other tissues such as muscle and neuronal tissue.<br>
Liver glycogen phosphorylase a activity is elevated in diabetic animal models including the db/db mouse and the fa/fa rat (Aiston S et al (2000). Dkibetalogia 43, 589-597).<br>
Inhibition of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase with chloroindole inhibitors (CP91149 and CP320626) has been shown to reduce both glucagon stimulated glycogenolysis and glucose output in hepatocytes (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). Additionally, plasma glucose concentration is reduced, in a dose related manner, db/db and ob/ob mice following treatment with these compounds.<br>
Studies in conscious dogs with glucagon challenge in the absence and presence of another glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, Bay K 3401, also show the potential utility of such agents where there is elevated circulating levels of glucagon, as in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In the presence of Bay R 3401, hepatic glucose output and arterial plasma glucose following a glucagon challenge were reduced significantly (Shiota et al, (1997), Am J Physiol, 273: E868).<br>
The heterocyclic amides of the present invention possess glycogen phosphorylase inhibitory activity and accordingly are expected to be of use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, syndrome X, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglucagonaemia, cardiac ischaemia and obesity, particularly type 2 diabetes.<br>

Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof which process (wherein A, Y, R1, R4, m, r and n are, unless otherwise specified, as defined in formula (1)) comprises of: a) reacting an acid of the formula (2):<br><br>
(Formula  Removed) or an activated derivative thereof; with an amine of formula (3):<br>
(Formula  Removed) and thereafter if necessary:<br>
i) converting a compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1); ii) removing any protecting groups; iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester.<br>
Specific reaction conditions for the above reaction are as follows.<br>
Process a)       Acids of formula (2) and amines of formula (3) may be coupled together in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent. Standard peptide coupling reagents known in the art can be employed as suitable coupling reagents, or for example carbonyldiimidazole, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide hydrochloride (EDCI) and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCCI), optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, optionally in the presence of a base for example triethylamine, di-isopropylethylamine, pyridine, or 2,6-di-a/AyJ-pyridines such as 2,6-lutidine or 2,6-di-/£/t-butylpyridine. Suitable solvents include dimethylacetamide, dichloromethane, benzene, tetrahydrofuran and<br>
dimethylformamide. The coupling reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of-40 to 40°C.<br>
Suitable activated acid derivatives include acid halides, for example acid chlorides, and active esters, for example pentafluorophenyl esters. The reaction of these types of compounds with amines is well known in the art, for example they may be reacted in the presence of a base, such as those described above, and in a suitable solvent, such as those described above. The reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature in the range of -40to40°C<br>
The acids of formula (2) are commercially available or they are known compounds or they are prepared by processes known in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (3) where Y is OR3 are commercially available or they are known compounds or they are prepared by processes known in the art. When Y is NR2R3, the amines of formula (3) may be prepared according to Scheme 1:<br><br>
(Scheme   Removed) Scheme 1<br>
Compounds of formula (3a) are commercially available or they are known compounds or they are prepared by processes known in the art. For example, starting from primary amines of formula (4), in which R is H or a suitable protecting group, one or both of R' and/or R2 may be introduced by acylation, (for example reacting with acetoxyacetic acid and l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC)), alkylation, reductive alkylation, sulphonation or related processes, followed by O-deprotection when appropriate. Alternatively, one or both of R1 and/or R2 may be obtained by modification of functionality in groups previously thus introduced, by reduction, oxidation, hydrolysis (for example the<br>
conversion of an acetoxy group to a hydroxy group), nucleophilic displacement, amidation, or a related process, or a combination of these processes, followed by O-deprotection when appropriate. It will be appreciated that such modifications may include modifications which convert one compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1).<br>
(Formula  Removed) Amines of formula (3) may alternatively be obtained by applying the processes described for the preparation of compounds of formula (3a) to compounds of formula (5) in which Z is NHa or a nitrogen atom with one or two suitable protecting groups.<br>
 (Formula  Removed) <br>
Compounds of the formula (3) where r = 1 and wherein A is heteroarylene can be prepared from suitably functionalised cycloalkyl fused heterocycles. For example, when A is pyridine,(Formula  Removed) <br>
compounds of formula (3b) and (3c) may be prepared from the corresponding pyrindinone regioisomer according to Scheme 2 :-<br>
(Scheme   Removed) Scheme 2<br>
Stepl is performed on a compound known in the literature (Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 1995,14. JP 07070136). Steps 2, 3,4, 5, 6,1 and 8 are performed using standard techniques cnown in the art.<br>
It will be appreciated that the bromopyrindinone isomers (6a, 6b and 6c) could<br>
(Scheme   Removed)<br>
be converted to the corresponding heterocylic version of (3) by the means described in Scheme 2. The bromopyrindinones can be prepared from the corresponding pyrindinone by standard techniques known in the art. The pyrindinones (7a, 7b, 7c) are known in the literature or they are prepared by processes known in the art. (Scheme   Removed) The process described above and shown in Scheme 2 may also be applied to other six membered heterocycles containing more than one nitrogen.<br>
It will be appreciated that, in a similar manner, compounds of the formula (3) wherein A is heteroarylene containing a bridgehead nitrogen can be prepared from the appropriate suitably functionalised cycloalkyl fused heterocycles.<br>
It will be appreciated that the processes described above for formation and modification of Y as NR!R2 may be applied similarly whether to make the compound of formula (3) before coupling to the acid of formula (2) or whether to the product of such a coupling.<br>
It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention, for example R1 and R4, may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions may convert one compound of the formula (1) into another compound of the formula (1). Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using l concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alky] halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogen group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley<br>
and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoy] group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a r-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
Certain intermediates in the preparation of a compound of the formula (1) are novel and form another aspect of the invention.<br>

Compounds to be tested are prepared in lOuJ 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOul 10% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 30uM CP320626 (Hoover et al (1998) J Med Chem 41, 2934-8; Martin et al (1998) PNAS 95,1776-81). The reaction is stopped after 30min with the addition of 50u,l acidic ammonium molybdate solution, 12ug ml"1 in 3.48% H2SO4 with 1% sodium lauryl sulphate and lOug ml"1 ascorbic acid. After 30 minutes at room temperature the absorbency at 620nm is measured.<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOuM or lOOuM. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICjo, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound OD620 - fully inhibited OD620)/ (non-inhibited rate OD620 -fully inhibited OD620)) * 100. OD620 = optical density at 620nM.<br>
Typical ICjo values for compounds of the invention when tested in the above assay are in the range lOOuM to InM.<br>
The activity of the compounds is alternatively determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of the compounds on glycogen degradation, the production of glucose-1 -phosphate from glycogen is monitored by the multienzyme coupled assay, as described in EP 0 846 464 A2, general method of Pesce et al ( Pesce, M A, Bodourian, S H, Harris, R C, and Nicholson, J F (1977) Clinical Chemistry 23,1171 - 1717).

The coupling enzymes, phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) are prepared in reagent buffer, final concentration 0.25Units per well. 20uJ of the hrl GPa solution is added to 10u,l compound solution and the reaction started with the addition of 20ul coupling enzyme solution. Compounds to be tested are prepared in lOuJ 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution, with final concentration of 1% DMSO in the assay. The non-inhibited activity of GPa is measured in the presence of lOjxl 5% DMSO in assay buffer solution and maximum inhibition measured in the presence of 5mgs ml"1 N-ethylmaleimide. After 6 hours at 30°C Relative Fluoresence Units (RFUs) are measured at 340nM excitation, 465nra emission .<br>
The assay is performed at a test concentration of inhibitor of lOuM or 100u\M. Compounds demonstrating significant inhibition at one or both of these concentrations may be further evaluated using a range of test concentrations of inhibitor to determine an ICso, a concentration predicted to inhibit the enzyme reaction by 50%.<br>
Activity is calculated as follows:-<br>
% inhibition = (1 - (compound RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)/ (non-inhibited rate RFUs - fully inhibited RFUs)) * 100.<br>
