3-Phenoxy-4-pyridazinol derivatives and herbicidal composition containing the same<br>
[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to a 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol compound, its salt, its ester derivative and agricultural chemical containing the same as an effective ingredient, and a herbicidal composition containing 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol compound and a second herbicidally active compound as effective ingredients.<br>
[Background art]<br>
In Chemical Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 1972, vol. 20, No. 10, pp. 2191-2203, 3-(2-allylphenoxy)-6-chloro-4-methoxypyridazine has been disclosed but .a 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol compound having a hydroxyl group at the 4-position of the pyridazine has not been disclosed, and there is no description about a herbicide.<br>
In Journal of the Chemical Society: Perkin Trans-action I, 1975, No. 6, pp. 534-538, 3-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)-4-methoxypyridazine and 6-chloro-3-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)-4-methoxypyridazine has been disclosed but a 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol compound having a hydroxyl group at the 4-position of the pyridazine has not been disclosed, and there is no description about a herbicide.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 5,559,080, a 3-(phenoxy which may be substituted)pyridazine compound having a haloalkyl-phenoxy group at the 4-position of the pyridazine has been disclosed but a 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol compound having a hydroxyl group at the 4-position of the pyridazine has not been disclosed.  Also, in the 3-(phenoxy which may be substituted)pyridazine compound having a haloalkylphenoxy group at the 4-position of the pyridazine, an oxygen atom bonded to the 4-position of the pyridazine is bonded by a<br><br>
benzene ring, and its herbicidal activity was insufficient.<br>
Also, at present, a number of herbicides have been practically used as a herbicide for a paddy field, and widely been used for general purpose as a single agent and a mixed agent.  However, there are many kinds of paddy field weeds, and germination and growth period of the respective weeds are not uniform, in particular, occurrence of perennial weeds ranges for a long period of time.  Thus, it is extremely difficult to prevent from and kill all weeds with one time spread of a herbicide.  Accordingly, as a herbicide, an appearance of a chemical which can kill many kinds of weeds including annual weeds and perennial weeds, that is, which has a wide weed-killing spectrum, is effective for already grown weeds, preventing and killing effects of weeds of which can be maintained for a certain period of time, and has high safety to paddy rice has earnestly been desired.<br>
Also, as upland herbicides, a number of herbicides have now been commercially available and practically used, but there are many kinds of weeds to be prevented, and occurrence thereof ranges for a long period of time, so that a herbicide which has higher herbicidal effects, has broad weed-killing spectrum, and causes no chemical damage to crops has been desired.<br>
One of the effective ingredient of the herbicidal composition of the present invention (hereinafter referred to as a second herbicidally active compound), 4-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)-1,3-dimethyl-5-pyrazolyl-p-toluenesulfon-ate [hereinafter referred to as Compound A.  General name: Pyrazolate], 2-[4-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)-1,3-dimethylpyra-zol-5-yloxy]acetophenone [hereinafter referred to as Compound B.  General name: Pyrazoxyfen], 2-[4-(2,4-dichloro-m-toluoyl)-1,3-dimethylpyrazol-5-yloxy]-4'-methyl-acetophenone [hereinafter referred to as Compound C. General name: Benzofenap], 5-cyclopropyl-l,2-oxazol-4-yl a,a,a-trifluoro-2-mesyl-p-tolyl ketone [hereinafter<br><br>
referred to as Compound D.  General name: Isoxaflutole], 2-(2-chloro-4-mesylbenzoyl)cyclohexan-1,3-dione [hereinafter referred to as Compound E.  General name: sulcotrione], 2-(4-mesyl-2-nitrobenzoyl)cyclohexan-1,3-dione [hereinafter referred to as Compound F.  General name: mesotrion] and 4-chloro-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl 5-cyclopropyl-4-isoxazolyl ketone [hereinafter referred to as Compound G.  General name: Isoxachlortole] are each conventionally known herbi-cidal compound, and each described in The Pesticide Manual 11th Edition, pp. 1049 to 1050, Ibid. pp. 1054 to 1055, Ibid. pp. Ill to 112, The Pesticide Manual, 12th Edition p. 563, Ibid. p. 848, Ibid. p. 602 and EP 470 856(1990). These compounds have high effects against annual broad-leaved weeds and a part of perennial weeds, but their effects against rice plant weeds or a part of perennial weeds are not necessarily sufficient. [Diclosure of the invention]<br>
The present inventors have earnestly studied about pyridazine derivatives having a phenoxy group at the 3-position thereof, and as a result, they have found that a compound having a hydroxyl group at the 4-position of the pyridazine ring shows substantially no chemical damage against paddy rice, and shows excellent herbicidal activity against a wide range of weeds in a paddy fied with a low dosage to accomplish the present invention.  Moreover, they have found that similar herbicidal activities are possessed by an ester derivative thereof in which a bonding between an oxygen atom at the 4-position of the pyridazine ring and an acyl group is cleaved in a soil or in a plant body to be converted into a compound in which a hydrogen atom binds to the oxygen atom, whereby accomplished the present invention.<br>
Also, the present inventors have continued to search on a herbicide which can completely prevent and remove various kinds of weeds with one time spread, has extremely high safety to paddy rice or upland crops, and has<br><br>
extremely low toxicity against humans and animals for the purpose of overcoming the above-mentioned problems involved in the conventional herbicides such as second herbicidally active compounds A, B, C, D, E, F and G, and as a result, they have found that by formulating the above-mentioned 3-phenoxy-4-pyridazinol derivatives and the second herbicid¬ally active compound as effective ingredients, a weed-killing spectrum can be enlarged, and serious weeds can be prevented and killed with a smaller amount of effective ingredients by their synergistic action, whereby accom¬plished the present invention.<br>

herbicidal activities both by foliar application and soil<br>
application agaist valious kinds of weeds, which are<br>
troublesome in upland fields.<br>
Moreover, they can be used not only in a paddy field<br>
and an upland filed, but also in an orchard, a mulberry<br>
field and a non-crop land.<br>
