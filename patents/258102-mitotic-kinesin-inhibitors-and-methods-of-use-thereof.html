MITOTIC KISfESIN INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/676,890, filed May 2,2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Field of the Invention<br>
[0003] This invention relates to novel inhibitors of mitotic kinesins, in particular the<br>
mitotic kinesin KSP, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors. The<br>
compounds of this invention are useful for the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases, for<br>
example cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders, fungal<br>
infections and inflammation. This invention also provides methods for preparing these<br>
inhibitors.<br>
[0004] Description of the state of the art<br>
[0005] Among the therapeutic agents used to treat cancer are the taxanes and vinca<br>
alkaloids, which act on micro tubules. Microtubules are the primary structural elements of the<br>
mitotic spindle, which is responsible for distribution of replicate copies of the genome to each<br>
of the two daughter cells that result from cell division. It is presumed that disruption of the<br>
mitotic spindle by these drugs results in inhibition of cancer cell division and induction of<br>
cancer cell death. However, microtubules form other types of cellular structures, including<br>
tracks for intracellular transport in nerve processes. Because drugs such as taxanes and vinca<br>
alkaloids do not specifically target mitotic spindles, they have side effects that limit their<br>
usefulness.<br>
[0006] Improvements in the specificity of agents used to treat cancer is of<br>
considerable interest, in part because of the improved therapeutic benefits which would be<br>
realized if the side effects associated with administration of these agents could be reduced.<br>
Traditionally, dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer have been associated with<br>
identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples include not<br>
only the taxanes, but also the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I inhibitors. From both of<br>
these perspectives, mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for new anti-cancer agents.<br>
[0007] Mitotic kinesins are enzymes essential for assembly and function of the<br>
mitotic spindle, but are not generally part of other microtubule structures such as nerve<br>
processes. Mitotic kinesins play essential roles during all phases of mitosis. These enzymes<br>
are "molecular motors" that transform energy released by hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical<br>
1<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
force which drives the directional movement of cellular cargoes along microtubules. The<br>
catalytic domain sufficient for this task is a compact structure of approximately 340 amino<br>
acids. During mitosis, kinesins organize microtubules into the bipolar structure that is the<br>
mitotic spindle. Kinesins mediate movement of chromosomes along spindle microtubules, as<br>
well as structural changes in the mitotic spindle associated with specific phases of mitosis.<br>
Experimental perturbation of mitotic kinesin function causes malformation or dysfunction of<br>
the mitotic spindle, frequently resulting in cell cycle arrest and cell death.<br>
[0008] Among the identified mitotic kinesins is kinesin spindle protein (KSP). KSP<br>
belongs to an evolutionarily conserved kinesin subfamily of plus end-directed microtubule<br>
motors that assemble into bipolar homotetramers consisting of antiparallel homodimers.<br>
During mitosis, KSP associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microinjection of<br>
antibodies directed against KSP into human cells prevents spindle pole separation during<br>
prometaphase, giving rise to monopolar spindles and causing mitotic arrest and induction of<br>
programmed cell death. KSP and related kinesins in other non-human organisms bundle<br>
antiparallel microtubules and slide them relative to one another, thus forcing the spindle poles<br>
apart. KSP may also mediate in anaphase B spindle elongation and focusing of microtubules<br>
at the spindle pole.<br>
[0009] Human KSP or HsEg5 has been described (Blangy, et al., Cell, 83:1159-69<br>
(1995); Whitehead, et al., Arthritis Rheum., 39:1635-42 (1996); Galtio, et al., J. Cell Biol,<br>
135:339-414 (1996); Blangy, et al., J. Bio. Chem., 272:19418-24 (1997); Blangy, et al., Cell<br>
Motil Cytoskeleton, 40:174-82 (1998); Whitehead and Rattner, J. Cell Sci., 111:2551-61<br>
(1998); Kaiser, et al., JBC 274:18925-31 (1999); GenBank accession numbers: X85137,<br>
NM004523 and U37426), and a fragment of the KP gene (TRIP5) has been described (Lee, et<br>
al., Mol. Endocrinol, 9:243-54 (1995); GenBank accession number L40372). Xenopus KSP<br>
homologs (Eg5), as well as Drosophilia K-LP61 F/KRP 130 have been reported.<br>
[0010] Small molecule inhibitors of KSP have recently been described in WO<br>
03/079,973 and WO 2005/035512.<br>
[0011] Mitotic kinesins are therefore attractive targets for the discovery and<br>
development of novel mitotic chemotherapeutics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

particular the mitotic kinesin KSP. The compounds of this invention have utility as<br>

function of microtubule structures, including the mitotic spindle.<br>

[00186] It is to be understood that in instances where two or more radicals are used in<br>
succession to define a substituent attached to a structure, the first named radical is considered<br>
to be terminal and the last named radical is considered to be attached to the structure in<br>
question. Tims, for example, an arylalkyl radical is attached to the structure in question by<br>
the alkyl group.<br>
[00187] The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric<br>
centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or<br>
as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular<br>
compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also<br>
includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers of the<br>
Formula I. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on<br>
the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art,<br>
for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated<br>
by converting the enantiomer mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an<br>
appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and<br>
converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure<br>
enantiomers. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of<br>
stereoisomers are well known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry", 4th edition, J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992).<br>
[00188] In addition to compounds of the Formula I, the invention also includes<br>
solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically active metabolites,<br>
solvates, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds.<br>
[00189] A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be<br>
converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a<br>
33<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein<br>
an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino<br>
acid residues (i.e., peptides) is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free<br>
amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the present invention. Amino acid<br>
residues include, but are not limited to, the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly<br>
designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine,<br>
demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric<br>
acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. One preferred<br>
prodrug of this invention is a compound of Formula I covalently joined to a phosphate<br>
residue. Another preferred prodrug of this invention is a compound of Formula I covalently<br>
joined to a valine residue or an alanine-alanine dipeptide.<br>
[00190] Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, free<br>
carboxyl groups can be deiivatized as amides or alkyl esters. As another example,<br>
compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs<br>
by converting the hydroxy group into groups such as, but not limited to, phosphate ester,<br>
hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl groups, as<br>
outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of<br>
hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and<br>
sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and<br>
(acyloxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted<br>
with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or<br>
where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed.<br>
Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., 1996,39,10. More specific examples<br>
include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C1-<br>
C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, l-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, l-methyl-1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,<br>
(C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl,<br>
(C1-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(C1-C4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-α-<br>
aminoacyl, where each α-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally<br>
occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, -P(O)(O(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting<br>
from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).<br>
[00191] Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or<br>
phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups Including, but not<br>
limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prodrug can be<br>
34<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-<br>
carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R1 are each independently (C1-C10)alkyl,<br>
(C3-C7)cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural a-aminoacyl-<br>
natural a-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H, (C1-C6)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY0)Y1<br>
wherein Y0 is (C1-C4) alkyl and Yi is (C1-C6)alkyl, carboxy(C1-C6)alkyl, amino(C1-C4)alkyl<br>
or mono-N- or di-N,N- (C1-C6)alkylaminoalkyl, -C(Y2)Y3 wherein Y2 is H or methyl and Y3<br>
is mono-N- or di-N,N-(C1-C6)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1 -yl or pyrrolidin-1 -yl.<br>
[00192] Prodrugs of a compound may be identified using routine techniques known in<br>
the art. Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug<br>
derivatives, see, for example, a) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier,<br>
1985) and Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 42, p. 309-396, edited by K. Widder, et al.<br>

[1)0193] A "metabolite" is a pharmacologically active product produced through in vivo<br>
metabolism of a specified compound or salt or prodrug thereof. Such products may result for<br>
example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification,<br>
deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. The<br>
invention also includes products produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of<br>
this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product<br>
thereof.<br>
[00194] Metabolites of a compound may be identified using routine techniques known<br>
in the art. For example, metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a<br>
radiolabelled (e.g., 14C or 3H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it<br>
parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat,<br>
mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur<br>
(typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine,<br>
blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled<br>
(others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the<br>
metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS,<br>
35<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as<br>
conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite<br>
products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for<br>
therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.<br>
100195] The term "solvate" refers to an aggregate of a molecule with one or more<br>
solvent molecules.<br>
[00196] A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," unless otherwise indicated, includes<br>
salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified<br>
compound and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. A compound of the<br>
invention may possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups,<br>
and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and<br>
organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present<br>
invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base, such salts including sulfates,<br>
pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogenphosphates,<br>
dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides,<br>
acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates,<br>
heptanoates, propiolal.es, oxalates, maionates, succinates, suberates, scbacates, fumarates,<br>
maleates, butyn-l,4-dioates, • hexyne-l,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates,<br>
methylbenzoates, dinitromenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates,<br>
sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, pheylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates,<br>
lactates, Y-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methanesulfonates, propanesulfonates,<br>
naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates. Since a single<br>
compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moiety, the<br>
compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
[00197] If the inventive compound is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of<br>
the free base with an acidic compound, particularly an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an<br>
organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such<br>
as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric<br>
acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic<br>
acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
36<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
or the like.<br>
[00198] If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an<br>
inorganic or organic base. Preferred inorganic salts are those formed with alkali and alkaline<br>
earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, barium and calcium. Preferred organic base<br>
salts include, for example, ammonium, dibenzylammonium, benzylammonium, 2-<br>
hydroxyethylammoniurn, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium, phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzyl-<br>
ethylenediamine, and the like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties may include, for example,<br>
those salts formed with procaine, quinine and N-methylglusoamine, plus salts formed with<br>
basic amino acids such as glycine, ornithine, histidine, phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.<br>
[00199] The compounds of Formula I also include other salts of such compounds<br>
which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and which may be useful as<br>
intermediates for preparing and/or purifying compounds of Formula I and/or for separating<br>
enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.<br>
[00200] The inventive compounds may be prepared using the reaction routes and<br>
synthetic schemes such as in Schemes I-XIX described below, employing techniques<br>
available in the art using starting materials that are readily available or can be synthesized<br>
using methods known in the art.<br><br>
[00201] Scheme I illustrates one method of preparing thiadiazoline intermediates of the<br>
Formula 1-3. Thiocarbazide 1-1 (Takasugi, J. J., Buckwalter, B. L., European patent EP<br>
1004241) can be condensed with the desired ketone or aldehyde 1-2 in an appropriate organic<br>
solvent such as ethanol, methylene chloride, 1,1-diethoxyethane or the like, optionally in the<br>
presence of a suitable acid such as acetic acid, at room temperature or elevated temperatures<br>
to give a thiadiazoline of Formula 1-3. In one embodiment, 1-1 is combined with 1-2 in<br>
ethanol at room temperature to afford thiadiazoline 1-3, wherein R1, Ar1 and Ar2 are as<br>
defined herein.<br>

[00202] Thiadiazolylthiadiazolines of the Formula II-4 can be prepared from<br>
intermediate 1-3 as illustrated in Scheme II. One method for generating thiourea intermediate<br>
H-l comprises reacting intermediate 1-3 with an appropriate thiocarbonylating agent such as<br>
thiocarbonyldiimidazole or thiocarbonylditriazole in a suitable solvent such as THF, 1.2-<br>
dichloroethane, methylene chloride, or acetonitrile at elevated temperatures, followed by<br>
treatment with ammonia. In one embodiment, intermediate 1-3 is reacted with<br>
thiocarbonyldiimidazole in THF at elevated temperatures (e.g., from 60 °C to reflux) and then<br>
treated with concentrated aqueous ammonia to afford II-1. Alternatively, II-l can be<br>
synthesized via treatment of 1-3 with a suitable acyl isothiocyanate or alkoxycarbonyl<br>
isothiocyanate such as benzoyl isothiocyanate, ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate, acetyl<br>
isothiocyanate or 4-chlorobenzoyl isothiocyanate in an appropriate solvent such as THF,<br>
methylene chloride, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile or DMF at elevated temperatures to form<br>
II-2, where R is alkyl, aryl or alkoxy.<br>
[00203] Intermediate II-2 can then be converted to II-l by removal of the acyl or<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group with a suitable base such as, but not limited to, K2CO3, NaOH,<br>
NaOMe, ammonia or hydrazine in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetone,<br>
THF, or aqueous mixtures of such solvents at elevated temperatures. In one embodiment, 1-3<br>
is treated with benzoyl isothiocyanate in THF at reflux to afford II-2, which is then subjected<br>
to aqueous K2CO3 in methanol with heating (70 °C) to generate II-l. Intermediate II-l can<br>
38<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
be converted to II-4 by heating with an appropriate a-haloketone or a-haloaldehyde II-3 in a<br>
suitable solvent such as efhanol, DMF or acetone at elevated temperatures. Optionally, a<br>
base such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine can be added to the reaction mixture<br>
when either II-l or II-3 bears acid-sensitive functionality. In one embodiment, intermediate<br>
II-l is heated (60-70 °C) with II-3 and diisopropylethylamine in ethanol to provide<br>
compound II-4.<br>
[00204] For the purposes of Scheme II, R1, Ar1 and Ar2 are as defined herein, R5<br>

[00205] Compounds of Formulas m-5 and III-9 can be synthesized as illustrated in<br>
Scheme III. To prepare a compound of Formula III-5, intermediate 1-3 can be reacted with<br>
carbonyldiimidazole in a suitable solvent such as THF or methylene chloride at elevated<br>
temperatures to provide III-1. Intermediate III-1 can men be alkylated with a suitable<br>
alkylating agent such as, but not limited to, iodomethane, methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate,<br>
or benzyl bromide, in an appropriate solvent such as acetonitrile or methylene chloride at<br>
room temperature or elevated temperatures to produce imidazolium intermediate III-2, where<br>
R' is alkyl or arylmethyl. In one embodiment, III-1 is alkylated using iodomethane in<br>
acetonitrile. III-4 can be synthesized by treating III-2 with an appropriate amine of the<br>

Formula III-3 in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or<br>
excess m-3 in a suitable solvent such as THF, DMF or methylene chloride. In another<br>
embodiment, ni-2 is subjected to excess III-3 in methylene chloride to afford urea III-4.<br>
Urea III-4 can be converted to 3-oxazolylthiadiazoline III-5 by a procedure that includes<br>
hydrolysis of the dialkyl acetal utilizing an appropriate acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
TFA or sulfuric acid in a suitable aqueous-organic solvent mixture such as wet acetone,<br>
chloroform-water, or wet methanol, followed by isolation of the deprotected intermediate<br>
(which can exist as a mixture of aldehyde and hemiacetal species) and subjecting this crude<br>
material to conditions for oxazole formation. Oxazole formation can be achieved under a<br>
variety of reaction conditions such as, but not limited to: 1) a two-step, one-pot procedure in<br>
which the first step comprises treatment with a combination of a phosphine such as<br>
triphenylphosphine, a halogenating reagent such as iodine, bromine, hexachloroethane or 1,2-<br>
dibromo-l,l,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and a suitable base such as triethylamine, pyridine,<br>
collidine, or 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in an appropriate solvent such as methylene chloride or<br>
acetonitrile, and the second step comprises treatment with a suitable base such as DBU,<br>
triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine at room temperature or elevated temperatures; or 2)<br>
POCl3, SOCl2, Burgess reagent or like reagents in a suitable solvent such as toluene, pyridine,<br>
acetonitrile or THF at elevated temperatures. In one embodiment, III-4 is heated at elevated<br>
temperature (e.g., 70 °C) with p-toluenesulfonic acid in THF-water solvent. The crude<br>
product is then isolated and immediately treated with triphenylphosphine, 1,2-dibromo-<br>
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in dichloromethane followed by DBU<br>
in acetonitrile to afford III-5.<br>
[00206] To prepare a compound of Formula III-9, as shown in Scheme III,<br>
imidazolium intermediate III-2 can be converted to urea intermediate EI-7 by treatment with<br>
the appropriate amino alcohol 1U-6 in the presence of a base such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine or excess III-6 in a suitable solvent such as THF or methylene<br>
chloride. Oxidation of III-7 to provide ketone III-8 can be achieved by treatment with a<br>
suitable oxidizing agent in an appropriate solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents include, but are not limited to, DMSO/oxalyl chloride/NEt3 and<br>
Dess-Martin periodinane. Intermediate III-8 can be converted to III-9 under suitable reaction<br>
conditions such as, but not limited to: 1) a two-step, one-pot procedure in which the first step<br>
comprises treatment with a combination of a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine, a<br>
halogenating reagent such as iodine, bromine, hexachloroethane or 1,2-dibromo-l,1,2,2-<br>
tetrachloroethane, and a suitable base such as triethylamine, pyridine, collidine, or 2,6-di-tert-<br>

diisopropylethylamine at room temperature or elevated temperatures; or 2) POCI3, SOCl2,<br>
Burgess reagent or like reagents in a suitable solvent such as toluene, pyridine, acetonitrile or<br>

thiadiazolines of Formula V-2. Intermediate V-l can be prepared from 1-3 in a manner<br>
similar to the preparation of II-l in Scheme II. In one embodiment, 1-3 is reacted with<br>
thiocarbonyldiimidazole in THF at reflux and then treated with 2-bromoethylamine at reflux<br>
to afford V-l where X is bromine. Optionally, a base such as diisopropylethylamine or<br>

where X is a leaving group, can be converted to a thiadiazoline V-2 with a suitable base such<br>
as, but not limited to, a tertiary amine, K2CO3, NaOMe, or NaOH, or by heating intermediate<br>
V-l at elevated temperatures in a suitable organic solvent such as THF, ethanol, methylene<br>

1 is treated with N,N'-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine in<br>
tetrahydrofuran, followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid in dioxane to remove the tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl protecting groups to afford XIX-3 wherein R18, R20 and R21 are hydrogen.<br>
[00235] In the preparation of some analogues such as described in Schemes I-XIX, the<br>
use of appropriate protecting groups for functionality contained within the various<br>
substituents may be necessary. In these cases, deprotection of said functionality can be<br>
accomplished using standard methods known by and available to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00236] The compounds of the invention find use in a variety of applications. As will<br>
be appreciated by those skilled in the art, mitosis may be altered in a variety of ways. That is,<br>
one can affect mitosis either by increasing or decreasing the activity of a component in the<br>
mitotic pathway. Stated differently, mitosis may be affected (e.g., disrupted) by disturbing<br>
equilibrium, either by inhibiting or activating certain components. Similar approaches may<br>
be used to alter meiosis.<br>
[00237] In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are used to modulate<br>
mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis. The term<br>
"modulate" as used herein means altering mitotic spindle formation, including increasing and<br>
decreasing spindle formation. The term "mitotic spindle formation" as used herein refers to<br>
organization of microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. "Mitotic spindle<br>
dysfunction" refers to mitotic arrest and monopolar spindle formation.<br>
[00238] The compounds of the invention are useful to bind to and/or modulate the<br>
activity of a mitotic kinesin. In an embodiment, the mitotic Idnesin is a member of the bimC<br>
subfamily of mitotic kinesins as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,480, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In a further embodiment, the mitotic kinesin is human<br>
KSP, although the activity of mitotic kinesins from other organisms may also be modulated<br>
by the compounds of the present invention. In this context, modulate means either increasing<br>
or decreasing spindle pole separation, causing malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle<br>
poles, or otherwise causing morphological perturbation of the mitotic spindle. Also included<br>
within the definition of KSP for these purposes are variants and/or fragments of KSP. In<br>
addition, other mitotic kinesins may be inhibited by the compounds of the present invention.<br>
[00239] The compounds of the invention are useful for treating diseases and conditions<br>
caused by abnormal cell growth or cellular proliferation. Disease states which can be treated<br>
60<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
by the methods and compositions provided herein include, but are not limited to, cancer,<br>
autoimmune disease, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, and proliferation<br>
induced after medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the<br>
like. It is appreciated that in some cases the cells may not be in a hyperproliferative or<br>
hypoproliferative state (abnormal state), but still require treatment. For example, during<br>
wound healing, cells may be proliferating "normally", but proliferation enhancement may be<br>
desired. Similarly, in the agriculture arena, cells may be in a "normal" state, but proliferation<br>
modulation may be desired to enhance a crop by directly enhancing growth of a crop, or by<br>
inhibiting the growth of a plant or organism which adversely affects the crop. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment, the invention herein includes application to cells or individuals that are afflicted<br>
or may eventually become afflicted with any one of these disorders or states.<br>
[00240] The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions for treating a<br>
hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug,<br>
metabolite or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment,<br>
said pharmaceutical composition is for the treatment of a hyperproliferative disorder such as<br>
cancer, including, but not limited to, skin, brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric,<br>
pancreatic, breast, head, neck, renal, kidney, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, esophageal,<br>
testicular, gynecological, cardiac, liver, bone, meninges, spinal cord, blood, skin, adrenal and<br>
thyroid cancer.<br>
[00241] The compounds of the present invention may also be useful as antifungal<br>
agents, by modulating the activity of the fungal members of the bimC kinesin subgroup, as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,480.<br>
[00242] The invention also relates to a method of treating a hyperproliferative disorder<br>
in a mammal, comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug,<br>
metabolite or solvate thereof. In one embodiment, said method relates to the treatment of<br>
cancer such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck,<br>
renal, kidney, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, esophageal, testicular, gynecological, cardiac,<br>
liver, bone, meninges, spinal cord, blood, skin, adrenal or thyroid cancer.<br>
[00243] Patients that can be treated with compounds of the present invention, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, metabolites or solvates of said compounds,<br>
according to the methods of this invention include, for example, patients that have been<br>
diagnosed as having lung cancer, bone cancer, CMML, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer<br>
61<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
of the head and neck, cutaneous or intraocular melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer,<br>
rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer,<br>
testicular, gynecologic tumors (e.g., uterine sarcomas, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes,<br>
carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina or<br>
carcinoma of the vulva), Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small<br>
intestine, cancer of the endocrine system (e.g., cancer of the thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal<br>
glands), sarcomas of soft tissues, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, prostate cancer,<br>
/ chronic or acute leukemia, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphomas, cancer of the<br>
bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal<br>
pelvis), or neoplasms of the central nervous system (e.g., primary CNS lymphoma, spinal<br>
axis tumors, brain stem gliomas or pituitary adenomas).<br>
[00244] The terms "abnormal cell growth" and "hyperproliferative disorder" are used<br>
interchangeably in this application and, unless otherwise indicated, refer to cell growth that is<br>
independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This<br>
includes, but is not limited to, the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) that<br>
proliferate by expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase or overexpression of a receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase; (2) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant<br>
tyrosine kinase activation occurs; (3) any rumors that proliferate by receptor tyrosine<br>
kinases; (4) any tumors that proliferate by aberrant serine/threonine kinase activation; and<br>
(5) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant<br>
serine/threonine kinase activation occurs.<br>
[00245] The term "treating," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means<br>
reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to<br>
which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term<br>
"treatment," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as<br>
"treating" is defined immediately above. "Treating" is intended to mean at least the<br>
mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, and includes, but is not<br>
limited to, modulating and/or inhibiting the disease condition; and/or alleviating the disease<br>
condition.<br>
[00246] The compounds of this invention may be used alone or in combination with<br>
other drugs and therapies used in the treatment of disease states which would benefit from the<br>
inhibition of mitotic kinesins. Accordingly, another aspect of this invention provides a<br>
method for treating a hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal that comprises administering<br>
to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or<br>

comprising contacting said cells with an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a<br>
solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of Formula I.<br>
[00262] It is believed that the compounds of the present invention can render abnormal<br>
cells more sensitive to treatment with radiation for purposes of killing and/or inhibiting the<br>
growth of such cells. Accordingly, this invention further relates to a method for sensitizing<br>
65<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
abnormal cells in a mammal to treatment with radiation, which comprises administering to<br>
the mammal an amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>

sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of treatment<br>
[00264] The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with<br>
inhibitors of mitotic kinesins. Examples of inhibitors of mitotic kinesins, and in particular the<br>
human mitotic kinesin KSP, are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 00/130,768, WO<br>

[00268] A compound of the present invention may also be administered in<br>
combination with an agent useful in the treatment of neutropenia, by way of simultaneous,<br>
sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of treatment. Such a neutropenia<br>
treatment agent is, for example, a hematopoietic growth factor, which regulates the<br>
production and function of neutrophils such as a human granulocyte colony stimulating<br>
factor, (G-CSF). An example of a G-CSF is filgrastim.<br>

of treatment.<br>
[00270] Although the compounds of Formula I are primarily of value as therapeutic<br>
agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including humans), they are also useful whenever it<br>
is required to inhibit the effects of KSP kinesin. Thus, they are also useful as<br>
pharmacological standards in the development of new biological tests and in the search for<br>
new pharmacological agents.<br>
[00271] The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a<br>
compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, metabolite, solvate or prodrug<br>
thereof, and methods of use thereof for inhibiting abnormal cell growth in a mammal,<br>
comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof an amount of a compound of Formula<br>
I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite, or prodrug, thereof, alone or in<br>
combination with an amount of one or more substances selected from anti-angiogenesis<br>
agents, signal transduction inhibitors, and antiproliferative agents, in amounts effective to<br>
inhibit abnormal cell growth.<br>
[00272] For example, anti-angiogenesis agents, such as MMP-2 (matrix-<br>
metalloprotienase 2) inhibitors, MMP-9 (matrix-metalloprotienase 9) inhibitors, and COX-II<br>
(cyclooxygenase II) inhibitor's, can be used in conjunction with a compound or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors<br>
include CELEBREX™ (alecoxib), valdecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib and rofecoxib).<br>
Examples of useful matrix metalloprotienase inhibitors are described in PCT Publication Nos.<br>
WO 96/33172, WO 96/27583, WO 98/07697, WO 98/03516, WO 98/34918, WO 98/34915,<br>

U.S. Patent No. 5,863,949, and U.S. Patent No. 5,861,510. Preferred MMP-2 and MMP-9<br>
inhibitors are those that have little or no activity inhibiting MMP-1. More preferred, are<br>
those that selectively inhibit MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 relative to the other matrix-<br>
metalloproteinases (i.e., MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-4, MMP-5, MMP-6, MMP-7, MMP-8,<br>
MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, and MMP-13). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by<br>
way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of<br>
treatment Such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the<br>
dose range described herein and the other pharmaceutically active agent within its approved<br>
dose range.<br>
[00273] It will be understood that the specific dosage level and frequency of dosage for<br>
any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the<br>
68<br>
WO 2006/119146 ' PCT/US2006/016526<br>
activity of the specific compound of Formula I, the species, age, body weight, general health,<br>
sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug<br>
combination, and severity of the particular condition, but can nevertheless be routinely<br>
determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
[00274] This invention also provides compounds of Formula I for use in therapy. An<br>
additional aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of Formula I for the preparation<br>
of a medicament for use as a kinesin inhibitor.<br>
[00275] In order to use a compound of the Formula I, or a phannaceutically acceptable<br>
salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof, for the therapeutic treatment (including<br>
prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in<br>
accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition that<br>
comprises a compound of the Formula I, or a phannaceutically acceptable salt, solvate,<br>
metabolite or prodrug thereof as defined herein, in association with a phannaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
[00276] To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention, a<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof (alone or together<br>
with an additional therapeutic agent as disclosed herein) is preferably intimately- admixed<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical<br>
compounding techniques to produce a dose. A carrier may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral.<br>
Examples of suitable carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media, adjuvants,<br>
coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents,<br>
sweeteners, stabilizers (to promote long term storage), emulsifiers, binding agents, thickening<br>
agents, salts, preservatives, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, flavoring agents, and<br>
miscellaneous materials such as buffers and absorbents that may be needed in order to<br>
prepare a particular therapeutic composition. The use of such media and agents with<br>
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional media or agent is incompatible with a compound of Formula I, its use in the<br>
therapeutic compositions and preparations is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients<br>
can also be incorporated into the compositions and preparations as described herein.<br>
[00277] The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for<br>
example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions,<br>
69<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams,<br>
ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation<br>
(for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by<br>
insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for<br>
example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular<br>
dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing).<br>
[00278] Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation<br>
include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or<br>
calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid;<br>
binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or<br>
talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such<br>
as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their<br>
disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using<br>
conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
[00279] Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in<br>
which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active<br>
ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. For<br>
example, compositions intended for oral use may also contain, for example, one or more<br>
coloring, sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.<br>
[00280] Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely<br>
powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as<br>
lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example<br>
polyoxethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain<br>
aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of<br>
ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial<br>
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan<br>
monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives (such as<br>
ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate), anti-oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), coloring agents,<br>
flavoring agents, and/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
70<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
[00281] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such<br>
as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as<br>
beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and<br>
flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions<br>
may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
[00282] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a<br>
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already<br>
mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents<br>
may also be present<br>
[00283] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of<br>
oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil,<br>
or a mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or<br>
gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, esters or partial<br>
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring and preservative<br>
agents.<br>
[00284] Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent,<br>
preservative, flavoring and/or coloring agent.<br>
[00285] The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile<br>
injectable aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known<br>
procedures using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending<br>
agents, which have been mentioned above. For parenteral formulations, the carrier will<br>
usually comprise sterile water, aqueous sodium chloride solution, 1,3-butanediol, or any other<br>
suitable non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent Other ingredients including<br>
those that aid dispersion may be included. Of course, where sterile water is to be used and<br>
maintained as sterile, the compositions and carriers must also be sterilized. Injectable<br>
suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending<br>
agents and the like may be employed.<br>
71<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
[00286] Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient<br>
with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at<br>
the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable<br>
excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
[00287] Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily<br>
solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient with<br>
a conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedures well<br>
known in the art.<br>
[00288] Compositions for administration by insufflation may be in the form of a finely<br>
divided powder containing particles of average diameter of, for example, 30 urn or much less,<br>
the powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one or more<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is then<br>
conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50 mg of active ingredient<br>
for use with a turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known agent<br>
sodium cromoglycate.<br>
[00289] Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a<br>
conventional pressurized aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an<br>
aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants<br>
such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol<br>
device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>
[00290] Compositions for transdermal administration may be in the form of those<br>
transdermal skin patches that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[00291] For further information on formulations, see Chapter 25.2 in Volume 5 of<br>
Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board),<br>
Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
[00292] The amount of a compound of mis invention that is combined with one or<br>
more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the<br>
subject treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the<br>
disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an<br>
effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day,<br>
preferably about 0.5 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human,<br>
this would amount to about 0.0035 to 2.5 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In<br>
some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than<br>
adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any<br>
72<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses<br>
for administration throughout the day. For further information on routes of administration<br>
and dosage regimes, see Chapter 25.3 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry<br>
(Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
[00293] The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of<br>
Formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age<br>
and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known<br>
principles of medicine.<br>
[00294] In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or "kit",<br>
containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. In<br>
one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a composition of Formula I or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt thereof. The kit may further comprise a label or<br>
package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example,<br>
bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of<br>
materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a compound of Formula I or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt thereof, or a formulation thereof which is<br>
effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the<br>
container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a<br>
hypodermic injection needle). The label or package insert indicates that the composition is<br>
used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In one embodiment, the label or<br>
package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a compound of Formula I or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt thereof, can be used to treat a disorder resulting<br>
from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the<br>
composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of<br>
manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered<br>
saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials<br>
desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters,<br>
needles, and syringes.<br>
[00295] The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the<br>
compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt thereof, and, if<br>
present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit comprises a first<br>
composition comprising a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate<br>
or salt thereof, and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise<br>
73<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second<br>
pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof,<br>
[00296] In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral<br>
forms of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt thereof,<br>
such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits<br>
can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example<br>
of such a kit is a "blister pack". Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and<br>
are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid<br>
can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a<br>
calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be<br>
administered.<br>
[00297] According to one embodiment, an article of manufacture may comprise (a) a<br>
first container with a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or salt<br>
thereof, contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second<br>
pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a third<br>
container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for<br>
injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may<br>
further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including<br>
other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
[00298] In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a composition of<br>
Formula I and a second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the<br>
separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet; however, the separate<br>
compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit<br>
comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is<br>
particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in<br>
different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage<br>
intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the<br>
prescribing physician.<br>
[00299] Accordingly this invention also provides a kit for treating an abnormal cell<br>
growth condition, wherein said kit comprises a) a first pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and<br>
b) instructions for use.<br>

[00300] In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises (c) a second pharmaceutical<br>
composition, wherein the second pharmaceutical composition comprises a second compound<br>
having anti-hyperproliferative activity. In certain embodiment comprising a second<br>
pharmaceutical composition, the kit further comprises instructions for the simultaneous,<br>
sequential or separate administration of said first and second pharmaceutical compositions to<br>
a patient in need thereof. In certain embodiments, said first and second pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are contained in separate containers. In other embodiments, said first and<br>
second pharmaceutical compositions are contained in the same container.<br>
[00301] In certain embodiments, this invention provides a kit for treating an abnormal<br>
cell growth condition such as hyperproliferative disorder or a hypoproliferative disorder. In<br>
other embodiments, this invention provides a kit for treating an abnormal cell growth<br>
condition such as cancer, autoimmune disease, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, or proliferation induced after a medical procedure. In other embodiments, this<br>
invention provides a kit for treating a fungal or other eukaryote infection in a mammal.<br>

[00388] The biological activities of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
demonstrated by the following assays.<br>
BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS<br>
Example A<br>
Enzyme assay<br>
[00389] The activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined by<br>
the following procedure. The assays were conducted at 30 °C in a Costar 3695 (96-well,<br>
polystyrene, 1/2-area, clear) plate in a final volume of 50 uL. Hydrolysis of ATP was<br>
129<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
monitored in a system that coupled the product ADP to the oxidation of NADH using<br>
pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Assay mixtures contained the following: 20 mM<br>
K^Pipes, pH 7.0, 0.01% Triton X-100,2 % DMSO, 25 mM KC1,2 mM MgCl2,1 mM DTT,<br>
25 uM ATP, 1 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate, 200 uM NADH, 7.9 U/mL pyruvate kinase, 9<br>
U/mL lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 uM bovine microtubules, 20 uM paclitaxel and 20 nM<br>
Eg5. The concentration of inhibitor was typically varied over the range of 10-200,000 nM.<br>
The reaction was monitored kinetically in an absorbance-based plate reader for a period of 10<br>
minutes. Velocities were estimated from linear fits to the progress curves and were expressed<br>
as POC (percent of uninhibited control wells). IC50's were estimated from the POC data<br>
using a standard 4-parameter logistical model and compared to a control inhibitor run in each<br>
plate. In this assay, compounds of the invention exhibited an IC50 of less than 50 μM.<br>
Example B<br>
Cell Viability Assay<br>
[00390] The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit cellular<br>
viability may be determined by the following procedure. Cells from a variety of established<br>
tumor cell lines, e.g. HeLa, were plated in Costar 3904 96-well plates, in growth medium, at a<br>
density that allowed for logarithmic growth over the period of the assay, and incubated at 37<br>
°C, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, compounds were added to the cells, at a final<br>
DMSO concentration of 0.5%. The concentration of inhibitor was typically varied over the<br>
range of 0.1-50,000 nM. Plates were then incubated as above. After a 72 to 96 hour<br>
incubation, 20 uL resazurin solution (Cell Titer Blue, Promega G8081) was added to all wells<br>
and the plates incubated for a further period of time. Viable cells convert resazurin to<br>
resorufin, a fluorescent end-product. The fluorescent signal was determined in a fluorescent<br>
plate reader at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission. The POC (percent of uninhibited control<br>
signal) was determined for each well, and the EC50 for inhibition of viability was determined<br>
from the inflection point of a standard 4-parameter logistical curve fitted to the values<br>
obtained. In this assay, compounds of the invention exhibited an EC50 of less man 50 uM.<br>
Example C<br>
Mitotic Arrest Assay<br>
[00391] Phosphorylation of Histone H3 on SerlO, which peaks in metaphase, is a well-<br>
established indicator of mitosis. Phosphorylation in excess of control cells is indicative of<br>
mitotic arrest. The ability of the compounds of the present invention to induce mitotic arrest<br>
was determined by the following procedure. Cells from a variety of established tumor cell<br>
lines, e.g. HeLa, were plated in Greiner 655946, 96-well, poly-D-lysine coated plates, in<br>
130<br>
WO 2006/119146 PCT/US2006/016526<br>
growth medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, compounds<br>
were added to the cells at a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. The concentration of<br>
inhibitor was typically varied over the range of 0.1-50,000 nM. Once compound was added to<br>
the cells, plates were incubated as above. After approximately 16 hours, cells were fixed<br>
with cold methanol. Plates were blocked and labeled with primary antibody to<br>
phosphoHistone H3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies SC-8656-R, 1 μg/mL) and to GapDH (RDI<br>
TRK-5G4-6C5). The cells were then labeled with secondary antibodies which were<br>
conjugated to fluorescent dyes emitting in the near infrared range (Molecular Probes Alexa<br>
680, Rockland IR800) and scanned on a Licor Odyssey or Aerius. The integrated intensity of<br>
signal for phosphoHistone H3 was normalized to the signal for GapDH for each well. The<br>
POC (percent of completely inhibited control signal) was determined for each well, and the<br>
EC50 for induction of mitotic arrest was determined from the inflection point of a standard 4-<br>
parameter logistical curve fitted to the values obtained. In this assay, compounds of the<br>
invention exhibited an EC50 of less than 50 μM.<br>
Example D<br>
Tumor Growth Inhibition<br>
[00392] The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit tumor growth in vivo<br>
may be determined by the following procedure, using the HT-29 human colon tumor cell line<br>
obtained from the American Type Culture collection (ATCC). HT-29 tumor cells (3 - 5 x<br>
106, in a volume of 100 μL PBS) are implanted subcutaneously in the flank of female nude<br>
mice. Tumors are allowed to grow to 150-250 mm3 in size. The length and width of the<br>
tumors are measured with calipers, and tumor volume is calculated using the formula: volume<br>
= (length x widtH2)/2. The mice are then randomized into treatment groups, typically 5 to 8<br>
per group, based on tumor volume. The mice then receive vehicle or compound on days 1,5,<br>
9 by IP injection. Dose is based on weight, measured the day of dosing. Tumor volume and<br>
weight are measured twice a week for the duration of the study. Mice are kept on study until<br>
tumors grow to about 1500 mm3 in size, after which the mice are euthanized by CO2<br>
inhalation. Tumor volume data are typically reported as V/V(0), where V = tumor volume on<br>
the day of measurement, and V(0) = tumor volume at day 1.<br>

the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will be readily apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and<br>
process shown as described above. Accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents<br>
