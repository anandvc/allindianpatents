Glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in mice and rats) are an important class of adrenocorticosteroids that regulate many metabolic and homeostatic processes and form a key component of the response to stress. Glucocorticoids act via intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and, in some tissues, mineralocorticoid receptors; both being nuclear transcription factors. Glucocorticoid action on target tissues depends not only on circulating steroid concentrations and the cellular expression of receptors, but also on intracellular enzymes that critically determine to which extent glucocorticoids gain access to receptors in an active forms, llbeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (llbeta-HSD's) catalyze the interconversion of the principal active ll-hydroxy-glucocorticoid (Cortisol in men) and their inactive 11-keto metabolites (cortisone in men).<br>
The enzyme 1 Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (1 Ibeta-HSDl) inter-converts inactive into active glucocorticoids, thereby playing a major role in local modulation of cellular agonist concentration and thus activation of corticosteroid receptors in target tissues. In a recent study made by F. Hoffmann-La Roche 'differences in gene expression in lean and obese men were analyzed using gene array technology in order to identify specific changes in gene expression that might be associated with insulin resistance or altered metabolism. This study revealed that the rnRNA for 1 Ibeta-HSDl is approximately two-fold up regulated in adipose tissue in obese individuals. Moreover, overexpressing llbeta-HSDl in adipocytes of mice led to visceral obesity and to a syndrome-X like phenotype (Masuzaki H. et al., Science. 2001 Dec 7; 294(5549):2166-70.). Taken together, these data very strongly support an important role of 1 Ibeta-HSDl in the induction of obesity and the impairment of glucose homeostasis and lipid parameters. Thust selective inhibition of this enzyme could lower blood glucose levels in Type 2<br>
diabetic patients, normalize elevated lipid parameters and/or reduce weight in obese subjects.<br>
The first pharmacological indication that llbeta-H5L&gt;i inniDinon in men might have beneficial effects were obtained by using carbenoxolone, an anti-ulcer drug which inhibits both llbeta-HSDl and the related enzyme llbeta-HSD2. Treatment with carbenoxolone led to an increase in insulin sensitivity indicating that that inhibition of 1 Ibeta-HSDl may reduce cellular cortisol levels and therefore minimizing some of its deleterious effects. (Walker et al. 1995; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80,31155-3159).<br>
1 Ibeta-HSDl is expressed in many tissues including liver, adipose tissue, vascular smooth muscles, pancreas and brain. Its activity is dependent on NADP(H) and it has a relatively low affinity for its substrate (compared to llbeta-HSD2). 11 beta-HSDl in tissue homogenates and when purified is bidirectional, exhibiting both llbeta-dehydrogenase and llbeta-reductase reactions, with greater stability of the dehydrogenase activity (P.M. Stewart and Z.S. Krozowski, Vitam. Horm. 57 (1999), pp. 249-324). However, when the enzyme activity is tested in intact cells, the llbeta-reductase activity predominates, which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inert 11-keto forms. Suchglucocorticoid regeneration will increase effective intracellular glucocorticoid levels and thereby amplifying glucocorticoid activity. It is this elevated cellular cortisol concentration that might lead to increased hepatic glucose production, adipocyte differentiation and insulin resistance.<br>
Inhibition of llbeta-HSDl should not only reduce the typical Syndrome-X / Diabetes associated symptoms, but it should also be save and without major side effect Studies with the unspetific inhibitor carbenoxolone. highlight the importance of developing specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors. The inhibition of the llbeta-HSD2 enzyme is badly tolerated and results in increased blood pressure. In contrast inhibition of llbeta-HSDl should be well tolerated since llbeta-HSDl knockout mice were found be healthy and to resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress (Kotelevtsev Y. et aL, Proc Nati Acad Sci USA. 1997 Dec 23;94(26):14924-9). Similar upon starvation these mice had attenuated activation of key hepatic enzymes that are involved in gluconeogenesis. In addition, these mice had improved lipid and lipoprotein profiles suggesting that inhibition of HSD1 might be highly efficacious and safe. Recent reports indicate that llbeta-HSDl inhibitors might also be beneficial to reduce high blood pressure (Masuzaki H. et al., J Clin Invest. 2003 July,112(l):83-90; Rauz S. et al., QJM. 2003 July;96(7):481-90) to improve<br>
cognition (Sandeep TC. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr. 27;101(17):6734-9) or to improve Alzheimer associated deficits. Taken together llbeta-HSDl inhibition might be a save and efficacious approach to treat symptoms of diabetes, obesity and other diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. In particular they are 1 Ib-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) and they display selectivity against the related llbeta-HSD2 enzyme. Therefore the compounds which are specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) represent an approach to e.g. lower blood glucose levels and normalize lipid parameters in Type 2 diabetic patients by modulating the local concentration of the active glucocorticoid cortisol in target tissue (liver, adipose tissue).<br>

Processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula I are an object of the invention.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula I of the present invention may be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses of the invention are shown in the following Schemes. The skills required for carrying out the reaction and purification of the resulting products are known to those in the au. The substituents and indices used in the following description of the processes have the significance given above unless indicated to the contrary.<br>
Compounds of general formula I can be obtained according to scheme 1 from compounds of formula II comprising R1 to R7 substituents and A, E, G definitions according to the above description via a condensation reaction with aryl, heteroaryl or heterocyclyl sulfonyl chlorides, in the presence of a base such as trietylamine or (4-dimetylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) in a solvent such THF, ethanol, methylene chloride DMF or DMSO, or in pyridine as a solvent, with or without the addition of a base such as trietylamine or DMAP, at room temperature or at elevated temperatures, to give compounds of general formula I. Compounds of formula I where R5 equals alkyl can also<br>
be prepared from compounds of formula I where R5 equals H via an alkylation reaction, using, for example, NaH as a base and DMF as solvent, at room temperature or at elevated temperatures.<br>
lternatively, compound of general formula I can be prepared according to scheme 2 from compounds of general formula III in a substitution reaction with an corresponding aryl heteroaryl or heterpcydyl sulphonamide, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride, NaaCOs or triethyl amine and in a solvent such as THF, DMF or DMSO at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. The reaction can also be carried out under the condition of an UUman-type reaction with, for example Cu(I) chloride, or Cu(I) iodide in a solvent such as dioxane or DMF, in analogy to a method described by S.L. Buchwald (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2001,7727).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A further alternative consists of reacting compounds of general formula IV via a metal-catalysed (Pd or Ni) cross-coupling reaction with corresponding organometallic reagent such as (hetero)arylboron, (hetero)arylzink or (hetero)aryltin reagents using Suzuki-,<br>
Stifle- or Negishi-type coupling reactions (for literature: Suzuki, Chem. Rev., 1995,95, 2475; Stille, Angew. Chem. IEE, 1986,25,508; Negishi, Ace. Chem: Res., 1982,15,340).<br>
Intermediated II, III and IV are either commercial available, known in the literature or can be prepared by applying a sequence of standard reactions known in the art and outlined in scheme 4. Thus, starting from appropriate 2-pyridones of formula V, which are either known in the literature or can be prepared according to standard procedures, subsequent halogenation with POC13.PC13 or POBrs gives rise to the corresponding 2-chloro or 2-bromo pyridines of formula VI. The iodo derivatives can be obtained from the chloro or bromo derivatives via halogen exchange with Nal (for general reaction of this type: R.C. Corcoran, Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, p6757). Subsequent reaction with alkyl amines or ammonia, either applied in access, without solvent, or in equimolar amounts, in a suited solvent such as ethanol, water, DMF or THF, gives rise to compounds of formula VEL The reaction can also be performed in an autoclave at elevated pressure in analogy to published procedures (for an example: T. Haga, Heterocyles, 22, pl!7).<br><br>
Compounds of formula II can then be be prepared from VU via a metal-catalysed (Pd or Ni) cross-coupling reaction with corresponding organometallic reagent such as (hetero)arylboron, (hetero)arylzink or (hetero)aryltin reagents using Suzuki-, Stille- or Negishi-type coupling reactions as descibed above. The amino group can optionally be protected with standard protecting groups such as BOC or pivaloyl prior to performing the cross-coupling reaction. Compounds of formula III are obtained from compounds of formula VIII (prepared from V via metal-catalysed cross-coupling as for II) by an halogenation reaction (as for the preparation of VI). Compounds of formula IV can be prepared from VI via a nudeophilic substitution reaction with a corresponding aryl, heteroayryl or heterocycylyl sulfonamide in a solvent such as DMSO or DMF in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydride, at room temperature or at elevated temperature. The sulfonamides used in this step are either commercial, known in the literature or can be obtained by standard procedures known in the art. They can also first be converted into their sodium or potassium and these salts can then be used in the reaction, a procedure which does not require the addition of further base. Alternatively, IV can be obtained from VII by reacting with the corresponding aryl, heteroaryi or heterocyclyl sulfonyl chlorides as described above.<br>

Assay Procedures Transient expression and partial Purification:<br>
The cDNA encoding the human llbeta-HSDl protein was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Stratagene). This construct (for details see Alex Odermatt et al.; J Biol Chem.,1999, Vol. 274, Issue 40, 28762-28770) was used to transiently express the protein in HEK293 cells (ATCC number: CRL-1573, described in Graham, F.L., Smiley, J., Russell, W.C., Nairn, R.; (1977)) using lipofectamine. 48h after transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (Phsophate buffered Saline). To 1 volume of cell suspension in PBS 2 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Trisj pH7.5; ImM EDTA; lOOmM NaCl) were added. The cells were lysed by Potter-homogenization (20 strokes). The resulting homogenate was sonicated wit a tip sonicator (10% output; 2 x 30 sec.) and cleared by a low speed centrifugation (lOmin x 9000g; 4°C). The microsomal fraction was collected by a high speed centrifugation (60 min x 110'OOOg). The resulting pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 10% Glycerol) and the centrifugation was repeated. The resulting pellet containing the microsomal fraction was again taken up into storage buffer and aliquots were kept frozen in liquid Nitrogen until use.<br>
Generation of stable cell lines expressing llbeta-HSDl:	<br>
The same construct used for transient expression of human llbeta-HSDl was also used to establish cell lines stably expressing the protein. Briefly, (HEK293) cells were transfected with llbeta-HSDl construct using the lipofectamine reagent (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transfection, geneticin selection (0.8 mg/ml) was initiated and several stable clones were isolated. One clone was further used for pharmacological characterization.<br>
Microsome Assay<br>
Microsomes isolated from HEK293 cells transiently expressing human llbeta-HSDl (for details see above) were incubated in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl; ImM EDTA; ImM EGTA; ImM MgCl; 250 mM Sucrose; 20 mM Tris pH 7.4; Cortisone 50-200nM and NADPH ImM) together with different concentrations of test substances. After 60 min. of incubation at 37°C the assay was stopped by heating to 80°C (5 min.) and by addition of the inhibitor Carbenoxolone (1 uM). The amount of Cortisol produced in this assay was determined using a commercially available, ELISA-based Cortisol-detection kit<br><br>
(Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.). Inhibitors were characterized by there IC50 values, e.g. the concentration at which the production of cortisol was 50% reduced.<br>
In this test preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. Most preferred compounds have IC50 values below lOnM.<br>
Cellular Assay<br>
To measure the effect of inhibitors in intact cells HEK293 cells stably expressing human llbeta-HSDl (see above) were cultivated in 96 well plates in DMEM. First inhibitors and 60 min later Cortisone was added to the cells. After 60 min of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere part of the medium was removed and the conversion from Cortisone to Cortisol was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.).<br>
Results obtained in the microsome assay using representative compounds of the invention as the test compounds are shown hi the following table:<br><br>
Compounds as described above have ICso values below 1000 nM; preferred compounds have ICso values below 100 nM. More preferred compounds have ICso values below 10 nM. These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered internally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drage'es, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions).<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic adjuvants for the production of tablets, coated tablets, drage'es and hard gelatin capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used, for example, as such adjuvants for tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for soft gelatin capsules, are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid substances and liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, viscosity-increasing substances, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
In accordance with the invention the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and particularly eating disorders and obesity. The dosage can vary in wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral idministration a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to 20 mg per kg body weight, preferably ibout 0.5 mg to 4 mg per kg body weight (e.g. about 300 mg per person), divided into<br>
preferably 1-3 individual doses, which can consist, for example, of the same amounts, should be appropriate. It will, however, be clear that the upper limit given above can be exceeded when this is shown to be indicated.<br>
The invention is illustrated hereinafter by Examples, which have no limiting character.<br>
