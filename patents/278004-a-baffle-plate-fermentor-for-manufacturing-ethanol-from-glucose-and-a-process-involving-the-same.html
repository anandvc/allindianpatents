FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a baffle plate fermentor, and in particular, relates to<br>
the fermentor comprising of baffle plates in aqueous phase adapted for the<br>
manufacture of ethanol from glucose by subjecting glucose to fermentation in the<br>
presence of yeast in a biphasic medium. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to an improved process for manufacturing ethanol from glucose, facilitated by<br>
the use of the said baffle plate fermentor and a suitable organic solvent in the said<br>
biphasic medium having high distribution coefficient for ethanol.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The conventional way of making ethanol from starch involves either acid or<br>
enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation and atmospheric distillation.<br>
Anhydrous ethanol is obtained from the ethanol-water azeotrope produced in<br>
atmospheric distillation by several ways e.g. using a third component such as<br>
benzene to break the azeotrope or using either a membrane or a solid dessicant to<br>
remove the water from aqueous ethanol.<br>
The conventional processes are both capital and energy intensive. For instance it<br>
takes about 24 hours hold up time to complete fermentation of a given batch. Also<br>
both capital and energy consumption are high in obtaining anhydrous alcohol using<br>
any conventional azeotrope breaking process.<br>
Lately, the processes developed are directed to extractive fermentation using a<br>
suitable organic solvenc followed by distillation to produce 99.99 % ethanol wherein<br>
inert particles of proper shape were employed in the aqueous medium and the<br>
fermentor was vibrated to expedite fermentation by increasing the rate of mass<br>
transfer in and out of the yeast cells. Faster transfer of alcohol from aqueous to<br>
organic phase was achieved by recycling alcohol rich solution from bulk to interfacial<br>
region and withdrawal of alcohol depleted liquid from the interface and dispersal into<br>
the bulk.<br>
The advantages with the abovesaid process rests in cut down of fermentation time,<br>
and hence the size of the fermentor, produces 100 % ethanol, and produces the said<br>
 <br>
100 % ethanol as one of the product using simple technique of extraction of the<br>
alcohol into a high boiling organic solvent followed by distillation of the alcohol<br>
thereby producing ethanol. Since alcohol is removed into the organic phase as it is<br>
produced there is a gradual build up of alcohol in the aqueous phase leading to the<br>
higher conversion of glucose. The problem of alcohol inhibition was therefore<br>
eliminated in such fermentation processes due to formation of alcohol and<br>
simultaneous extraction.<br>
The process mainly comprises of simultaneous fermentation and extraction wherein<br>
glucose is fermented to ethanol and ethanol is simultaneously extracted out into the<br>
organic solvent such as 1- Decanol, Ethyl benzene, Isopropyl benzene, M-ethyl<br>
toluene, N-butyl propionate etc. the prerequisites of the said organic solvent being<br>
immiscibility with water, has high ethanol solubility and is lighter than the aqueous<br>
phase.<br>
The quantity of the said organic solvent used depends on a number of factors such<br>
as volume of the aqueous phase and distribution coefficient.<br>
Since it is the interface through which the alcohol transfer occurs, for faster transfer<br>
from the bulk to the interface, the aqueous phase can be pumped out from the bulk<br>
and discharge it near the interface continuously during the simultaneous<br>
fermentation and extraction process. Thus, maintaining a higher concentration<br>
gradient near the interface leads to higher rate of transfer. It is necessary to release<br>
the pumped liquid near the interface over the whole area uniformly such that the<br>
velocity is reduced as it enters but sufficient to penetrate the whole width of the<br>
interface. To enhance the rate of mass transfer appreciably it is suggested that not<br>
only one should recycle the alcohol rich liquid from the bulk to the interfacial region<br>
but also withdraw alcohol depleted layer (which sinks from the interface) from the<br>
interface where alcohol concentration is low and discharge below it in the bulk of the<br>
phase uniformly such that the concentration of alcohol in the bulk reduces uniformly.<br>
Essentially, what is achieved is faster rate of mass transfer by forced recycle and<br>
forced withdrawal that is faster than the natural convection currents.<br>
The rate of transfer of the alcohol rich liquid from the bulk can be varied by means of<br>
a valve and the rate of withdrawal of alcohol depleted liquid can also be controlled by<br>
 <br>
means of a valve. Both these rates should be optimized such that the rate of<br>
decrease of alcohol concentration in the bulk matches the rates of transfer across the<br>
interface and that from the interface to the organic phase.<br>
As already discussed above the fermentation process can be further expedited by<br>
shaking the fermentor and adding a iarge number of inert particles of appropriate<br>
shape and size in the aqueous phase.<br>
As the vessel is moved back and forth, the liquid adjacent to the vessel wall moves<br>
and portion of it pushes the particle while the other portion passes through the gap.<br>
Thus there occurs a velocity gradient in the gap because the particle moves at a<br>
slower velocity due to its weight than the liquid through the gap. Due to this velocity<br>
gradient within the liquid body, mass transfer rates in and out of the yeast cells<br>
increase by different amounts in the liquid layers which otherwise will not happen in<br>
absence of the particles and the said back and forth movement.<br>
At the end of the fermentation and extraction process the organic phase is pumped<br>
to a distillation column for separating 100 % ethanol from the organic solvent which<br>
is recycled. The aqueous phase containing ethanol, yeast, water and unconverted<br>
glucose is pumped to a distillation column after solid separation wherein alcohol is<br>
separated out as 95.6 % ethanol at the top and the bottom is waste water which can<br>
be either biodegraded or incinerated.<br>
Further modification to the above process in Indian patent no. 201474 by Dr. A.<br>
Sirkar was based on recycling techniques of the organic phase in addition to the<br>
already existing recycling of the aqueous phase, vibrating the fermenting vessel<br>
packed with inert particles to increase the rate of production. The reason behind such<br>
a modification is to recover maximum amount of alcohol from glucose in the shortest<br>
possible time and it was also observed in the said improved process that the rate of<br>
transfer of alcohol from the aqueous phase to the organic phase is affected by<br>
concentration factors of alcohol in the organic phase.<br>
The process mainly comprises of simultaneous fermentation and extraction wherein<br>
glucose is fermented to ethanol and ethanol is simultaneously extracted out into the<br>
 <br>
organic solvent such as 1- Decanol, Ethyl benzene, Isopropyl benzene, M-ethyl<br>
toluene, N-butyl propionate etc.<br>
Amongst these solvents the desirable ones are those for which the distribution<br>
coefficient, which is the concentration ratio of alcohol between the organic phase and<br>
aqueous phase, are high, in addition to the high boiling point such that substantial<br>
amount of alcohol can be extracted into the organic phase and separation of alcohol<br>
from the organic solvent would be easier with less capital investment and lower<br>
operating cost.<br>
It is thus clearly apparent form the abovesaid discussions that there is a long felt<br>
need in the art to provide for improvements in the existing process for the<br>
manufacture of ethanol from glucose involving fermentation of glucose by yeast that<br>
would thereby lead to a cost-effective process and would further assist to curtail the<br>
fermentation time required to ferment glucose along with the size of the fermentor.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for baffle plate<br>
fermentor for the manufacture of ethanol from glucose by subjecting glucose to<br>
fermentation in the presence of yeast in a biphasic medium which would avoid the<br>
limitations of the known prior art processes employing a solvent with low distribution<br>
coefficient and flat particles (with gaps inside) which require regular stacking to be<br>
effective as otherwise the same leads to not only poor extraction of the produced<br>
ethanol in the said solvent in the said fermentor or vessel but also lower the rate of<br>
fermentation in the aqueous phase.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a suitable organic solvent in<br>
the said biphasic medium into which ethanol is extracted after being produced from<br>
fermented glucose in aqueous medium with high distribution coefficient for ethanol.<br>

existing process for the manufacture of ethanol from glucose involving fermentation<br>
of glucose by yeast that would lead to a cost-effective process by employing the said<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENT ION<br>
As described hereinbefore, there is provided a baffle plate fermentor adapted to<br>
manufacture ethanol from glucose comprising subjecting an aqueous solution of<br>
around 10 percent glucose concentration and fermented at around 30 °C in the<br>
presence of yeast followed by separating ethanol produced at a pH of 4.5 and<br>
wherein the fermentation is carried out in the presence of organic solvent with high<br>
 <br>
distribution coefficient such as ethyl oleate so as to obtain an organic phase having<br>
high purity ethanol obtained from fermentation and wherein the organic phase and<br>
the aqueous phase are maintained in the volume ratio of 1:1, further subjecting the<br>
aqueous phase at the lower level of the biphase to recirculate in the following<br>
manner:<br>
a)	withdrawing a stream of the aqueous phase from the intermediate location in<br>
the aqueous phase and recirculate same to the aqueous phase at a level<br>
below that of the interface of aqueous phase and organic phase;<br>
b)	withdraw the stream of aqueous phase from the level immediately adjacent to<br>
interface from a location which is above the location at which the first<br>
mentioned recirculated stream is admitted as mentioned under point (a)<br>
above and recirculating the said withdrawn stream to a lower level in the<br>
aqueous phase;<br>
c)	withdrawing the product stream from near the bottom of the aqueous phase;<br>
d)	subjecting the said stream to centrifugation to separate spent yeast and<br>
useful liquid stream;<br>
e)	Recirculate the recovered yeast and subjecting the useful liquid stream to<br>
distillation to obtain ethanol stream (95.6 percent pure) and waste water<br>
effluent stream and wherein the organic phase at the top level of the biphase<br>
is subjected to recirculation in the following manner;<br>
<br>
a)	withdrawing the organic stream containing alcohol from near and above<br>
the interface and recirculate same to the bulk of the organic phase at a<br>
higher level;<br>
b)	withdrawing the stream organic phase from the bulk region and<br>
recirculating the same at near the interface;<br>
c)	withdrawing the product stream from the organic phase at a level from<br>
just above the interface containing high purity alcohol;<br>
d)	Subjecting the above stream to distillation to separate the organic solvent<br>
and the alcohol recycling the recovered solvent to the fermentor and<br>
recovering alcohol as the final product from the final product stream<br>
having 100 percent ethanol.<br>
It is seen form the flow diagram in Figure 1 that a fermentor (1) with baffle plates<br>
(BP) is used in which the fermentation of the required liquid takes place. An aqueous<br>
phase (2) is obtained which stays at the lower portion of the fermentor as aqueous<br>
 <br>
phase and wherein the organic and the aqueous phase is divided by an interface (I).<br>
An organic solvent is used to extract the alcohol produced due to fermentation and<br>
this produces an upper organic phase (3). The liquid slightly below the interface is<br>
recycled (4) to the aqueous phase. From an intermediate location in the aqueous<br>
phase, a stream (7) is withdrawn and recycled as stream (6) just below the level of<br>
withdrawal of (4). A stream (5) having alcohol is withdrawn from the bottom of the<br>
aqueous phase and is pumped to a centrifuge (8). In the centrifuge the spent yeast<br>
is separated from the liquid phase (9) having the alcohol. The liquid phase (9) is<br>
subjected to distillation in the distillation column (10) to obtain the distilled alcohol<br>
phase (11) of 95.6 % strength and a waste water stream (12) is sent to the effluent<br>
treatment plant.<br>
The organic phase containing the alcohol is also subjected to recycling in a manner<br>
similar to the aqueous phase. The liquid in the organic phase (3) from the bulk is<br>
recycled to a lower level as stream 4-A. A stream 6-A is withdrawn from below the<br>
level of injection of stream 4-A adjacent to the interface and injected in the bulk of<br>
the organic phase. Further a stream 5A having pure alcohol (99.9 %) is withdrawn<br>
from the bottom of the organic phase as stream (13) and is subjected to the<br>
distillation unit (14) for the separation of solvent and alcohol. The distilled alcohol<br>
stream is 100 % pure ethanol wherein the solvent stream is further sent to the<br>
fermentor.<br>
The finely divided inert particles used in prior fermentation processes were<br>
substituted by the baffle plate (BP) fermentor by way of the present invention that<br>
provides for an improved technique for cutting down the fermentation time as<br>
illustrated in (Figure 2) representing the top view of the baffle plate fermentor with<br>
incorporated baffle plates.<br>
The fermentor consists of baffle plates installed vertically (parallel to the wall of<br>
fermentor) in the aqueous phase. When the fermentor moves the liquid inside the<br>
vessel moves and creates a velocity gradient in the boundary layer next to the<br>
plates. This velocity gradient is responsible for increased rates of mass transfer from<br>
bulk containing glucose to cell walls of yeast and from cell wall of yeast to bulk of<br>
alcohol thus, cutting down the fermentation time. With higher velocities of back and<br>
forth movement, higher are the velocities of different layers within the boundary<br>
 <br>
layer and since the flocs are subjected to lateral velocity, mass transfer rates are<br>
higher compared to stagnant system.<br>
The invention is explained in further details by way of the following non-limiting<br>
examples:<br>
Example-I: Process and process parameters for the conversion of Glucose to<br>
alcohol<br>
20 liters of Molasses diluted to 10 % fermentable sugar (which is glucose), specific<br>
gravity 1.08 and 20 liters of solvent ethyl oleate were subjected to fermentation at<br>
around 30 °C in the presence of yeast for about 2.0 hours. The conversion of glucose<br>
to alcohol achieved was 90%. Recycle rates were 4 litres/hr, for two recycles in the<br>
aqueous phase and 2 litres/fr for two recycles in the organic phase. Time of<br>
fermentation in the aqueous phase and simultaneous extraction into the organic<br>
phase was 2 hours. The amount of total ethanol produced at the end of the<br>
fermentation was found to be 0.9568 kg of alcohol in 2 hours. This total amount of<br>
alcohol was the amount present in the upper organic phase as 100 % ethanol and in<br>
the lower aqueous phase as 95.6 % ethanol. The amount of ethanol in the organic<br>
phase (20 litres) was about 0.6834 kg. The amount of ethanol in the aqueous phase<br>
was about 0.2734 Kg. Further the correctness in the actual amount of ethanol<br>
produced was further confirmed and verified form the distribution coefficient of the<br>
said organic solvent and water in use of the aforesaid fermentation process, the<br>
calculations for which are presented below:<br>
Aqueous phase volume = 20 litres<br>
Organic phase volume = 20 litres<br>
Initial Glucose Concentration in Aqueous phase = 10 % by volume (sp.gr.-1.04)<br>
Glucose conversion Achieved = 90%<br>
Total alcohol produced = 0.9568 kg<br>
.-.0.9568 = cw x 20 + csol x 20<br>
where cw &amp; csol are final concentration of ethanol in aqueous and solvent phase<br>
respectively.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The total amount of absolute alcohol thus produced in the organic phase = 0.6834 kg<br>
in 20 litres of solvent (0.01367 kg/lit x 20 lit = 0.6834 kg)<br>
This is equivalent to 71.4% (0.6834 kg / 0.9568 kg x 100) of the total alcohol<br>
produced that is 100% pure.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a superior<br>
fermentation technique by way of employing the baffle plate fermentor with baffle<br>
plates installed vertically in the aqueous phase of the biphase facilitating the<br>
fermentation process by creating a velocity gradient in the boundary aqueous layer<br>
next to the plates due to the back and forth movement of the fermentor thereby<br>
leading to increased rates of mass transfer from bulk containing glucose to cell walls<br>
of yeast and from cell wall of yeast to bulk of alcohol thus, cutting down the<br>
fermentation time. The process of the present invention is thus cost-effective in<br>
achieving higher yield of 100 % ethanol in reduced fermentation time and also helps<br>
in curtailing the size of the fermentor to achieve the same higher yield of ethanol.<br>

distribution coefficient of ethanol in the said organic solvent.<br>
 <br>
4.	A process for the manufacture of ethanol from glucose as claimed in claim 3<br>
wherein said fermentor used comprises a baffle plate fermentor with the baffle plates<br>
installed vertically that are parallel to the walls of fermentor in the said aqueous<br>
phase to favour the formation of the said velocity gradient in the boundary layer of<br>
the said aqueous phase next to the plates due to the said back and forth movement<br>
of the said fermentor thereby adapted to increased rates of mass transfer from bulk<br>
to cell wall of glucose and from cell wall to bulk of alcohol whereby the flocs are<br>
subjected to lateral velocity to favour the mass transfer rate and reduce the<br>
fermentation time.<br>
5.	A process for the manufacture of ethanol from glucose as claimed in anyone of<br>
claims 3 or 4 wherein the aqueous phase at the lower level of the fermentor is<br>
recirculated in the process in the following manner:<br>
<br>
a)	withdrawing a stream of the aqueous phase from the intermediate location in the<br>
aqueous phase and recirculate the same to the aqueous phase at a level below that<br>
of the interface of the aqueous phase and organic phase;<br>
b)	withdrawing a stream of the aqueous phase from a level immediately adjacent to<br>
interface from a location which is above the location of the admitted stream (a)<br>
above and recirculating the said withdrawn stream to a lower level in the aqueous<br>
phase;<br>
c)	withdrawing the product stream from near the bottom of the aqueous phase;<br>
d)	subjecting the said stream to centrifugation to separate spent yeast and useful<br>
liquid stream;<br>
e)	Recirculate the recovered yeast and subjecting the useful liquid stream to<br>
distillation to obtain ethanol stream (95.6 % pure) and waste water effluent stream<br>
and wherein the organic phase at the top level of the biphase is subjected to<br>
recirculation in the following manner;<br>
a)	withdrawing the organic stream containing alcohol from near and above the<br>
interface and recirculate same to the bulk of the organic phase at a higher<br>
level;<br>
b)	withdrawing the stream organic phase from the bulk region and recirculating<br>
the same at near the interface;<br>
c)	withdrawing the product stream from the organic phase at a level from just<br>
above the interface containing high purity alcohol;<br>
 <br>
d) Subjecting the above stream to distillation to separate the organic solvent<br>
and the alcohol recycling the recovered solvent to the fermentor and<br>
recovering alcohol as the final product from the final product stream having<br>
100 % ethanol.<br>
6.	Process as claimed in anyone of claims 4 or 5 wherein the fermentor comprising<br>
the baffle plates in the aqueous phase is subjected to mechanical vibration so as to<br>
move back and forth facilitating the creation of a velocity gradient in the boundary<br>
layer of the aqueous phase next to the said plates characterized in that the higher<br>
velocity of back and forth movement facilitates higher velocities of different layers<br>
within the boundary layer and thus higher mass transfer from bulk to cell wall of<br>
glucose and from cell wall to bulk of alcohol.<br>
7.	A fermentor comprising baffle plates in aqueous phase for the manufacture of<br>
ethanol from glucose by subjecting glucose to fermentation in the presence of yeast<br>
in a biphasic medium and a process thereof substantially as herein described and<br>
illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
 <br>
<br>
A baffle plate fermentor comprising of baffle plates in aqueous phase adapted for the<br>
manufacture of ethanol from glucose by subjecting glucose to fermentation in the<br>
presence of yeast in a biphasic medium. The organic solvent of the said biphasic<br>
medium has high distribution coefficient for ethanol.<br>
