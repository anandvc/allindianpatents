				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>To achieve the aim of giving 2 bulbs almost for a single bulb price, 2 filaments are mounted in a single bulb with extra marginal materials and further this bulb can be fixed in present day holders without any change or modification to it. To facilitate to use the filaments one at a time, the principle that if two ends of an electrical load are connected to same point no current will flow through the load even though the point is electrically alive. In this bulb as shown in Fig. 3/Sheet No.3 when the twisted lead-in-wire 11 of both the filaments (F2-2l &amp; Fl-22) is inserted in the eyelet 2 by the change over connecting wi~e 3 and put in service in a holder, the current flows through Filament F 1- 22 since the two eyelets 1 &amp; 2 are connected to different potential. No current will flow through filament F2-2l since both the ends of the filament are connected to the same eyelet 2. If the change over connecting wire 3 is inserted in eyelet 1, the current will flow through only in Filament F2-21 and not through Filament Fl-22 as shown in . Fig. 4. Thus the two filaments are put in service one after another extending the life of bulb two times.</td>

BACKGROUND<br>
All types of electric bulbs mounted with tungsten filament produce light due to burning of tungsten filament at high temperatures. After certain burning hours (Approximately 1000 hours) the bulb fails due to the failure of filament only, whereas other parts of the bulb are in tact without any damage. If in case the damaged filament can be replaced with a new one, without causing any damage to the seal, the bulb can be reused Â£is fresh as a new one. By this invention "Sequentially operated twin filaments Electric Bulb", instead of replacing the damaged filament after its failure, during the original manufacturing process itself two filaments are mounted. The bulb is manufactured in such a fashion that the user can put the two filaments in service one after the another, thereby extending the life of the bulb by two times, (i.e.) approximately 2000 hours.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an Electric current connection in an incandescent bulb with two filaments to facilitate to utilise the two filaments in the bulb in sequence that is one after another.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Multi filament Electric bulbs are known in the art. Different approaches and ways of using filaments one after another have been suggested to put the filament in operative position one after another.<br>
Page No. 2/11<br><br>
1.	In us pat 3673534 the base of bulb is formed with multiple foldable contacts, insolated from each other, a new contact becoming in contact on folding away the contact of the defective filament.<br>
2.	In GB446297 dated 1936 04-28 one eyelet is used as common point where as in the other eyelet the other ends of multiple filaments are superimposed on one another but insulated from one another by non anchored discs or strips of wafer like form.<br>
3.	In WO 9710611 dated 1997-03-20 a circuit selecting mechanism comprising a sleeve which snugly but freely swivellable, a stem with ridge, a circuit selecting mechanism etc. is used to select the filament.<br>
So far no multifilament bulbs are found in use either due to economic considerations or due to technical reasons such as arcing, piercing of insulation etc.<br>
Page No. 3/11<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
By mounting two filaments of same watts or different watts with an incorporated electric connection in the cap of bulb we get, "Sequentially operated twin filaments Electric Bulb" with double life.<br>
The consumer gets two bulbs almost for the same price of one bulb. By doubling the utilisation of other parts of the bulb, pollution due to broken pieces of glass is also reduced.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Reference drawing No. Fig. 2/Sheet No. 2<br>
In this invention two filaments (Fl-22) and (F2-21) are mounted in a single bulb at different planes.<br>
Two lead in wires for each filament (Totally four lead-in-wires 9,10,15 &amp; 16) are provided to support and as well as to electrically connect each filament at its ends.<br>
To hold these four lead-in-wires (9,10,15 &amp; 16) in positions without touching each other and maintaining the required electrical insulation value of 50 MO between them, a modified stem (13) is incorporated in the bulb.<br>
To manufacture this modified stem (13), modified stem Holders with four holes to hold these four lead-in-wires in place during process of production of stems are incorporated in Stem making machine.<br>
Page No. 4/11<br><br>
One lead-in-wire of each filament is connected and soldered with each eyelet of the Cap (i.e. Lead-in-wire 9 of filament 22(F1) to eyelet 1 and lead-in-wire 10 of filament 21 (F2) to eyelet (2). The other two lead-in-wires 15 &amp; 16 of filaments 21 &amp; 22 are twisted together at above the stem as shown in Fig. 2/Sheet No. 2 and this twisted wire 11 is taken out through a hole 4 made in the black glass of the cap. The end of twisted wire 11 is connected to change over coimecting wire 3 which in turn is inserted into the tiny hole provided in the eye-let 2 to which already one lead-in-wire F2-21 is connected and soldered.<br>
Now the bulb is put in service by putting it in any bulb holder connected to power supply through a switch in a house. As shown in the Fig. 3/Sheet No. 3 once the supply to the bulb is switched on the current flows from one terminal of holder through eyelet 1, the lead-win-wire 9 of Filament Fl-22, Filament Fl-22, the other lead-in-wire 16 of Filament Fl-22, Twisted lead in wire 11, change over connecting wire 3, Eyelet 2 and returns to second terminal of holder completing the electrical circuit and so filament Fl-22 glows and gives light.<br>
Since both the lead-in-wires (of Filament F2-21) 10 and 15 through twisted wire 11 and change over connecting wire 3 are connected to the same eyelet 2 i.e. to the same electrical potential no current will flow through Filament F2-21 and so it would not glow.<br>
Page No. 5/11<br><br>
Once the Filament Fl-22 fails say after about 1000 hours burning the bulb is removed from holder, the change over connecting wire 3 is just gently pulled out from tiny hole of Eyelet 2 and then re-inserted in the tiny hole of Eyelet 1. The bulb is refixed in the holder. Now if power supply is switched on the Filament F2-21 glows giving light since the current flows through it as shown in Fig. 4/Sheet No. 3 and there will be no current flow through filament Fl-22 since both of its lead-in-wire are connected to same Eyelet-1.<br>
Just gently pulling out the change over connecting wire 3 from one eyelet 2 and re-inserting it in the tiny hole of other eyelet is simple and easy for any person, who used to change the fused bulbs in the house.<br>
By this invention, an improvement/modification is done over my previous invention patent (Applicant No. 1130/CHE/2004 and of which I am the applicant).<br>
The particulars of improvement are as follows :-<br>
a)	No change is to be done to the existing holder and it can be used as such as is done now.<br>
b)	No metal part either Aluminium/Brass part of the bulb cap or the metal part in holder is used to carry electrical current and it is same in every respect as the existing bulbs but with double life hours.<br>
Page No. 6/11<br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
I claim,<br>
1.	An Electrical circuit arrangement for a Two filaments incandescent tungsten<br>
electric bulb, incorporated in the metal cap of the said bulb itself with a<br>
provision to put the two filaments in sequent operation, wherein when the said<br>
bulb is put into operation, causes the current to flow through only one filament<br>
of the bulb at any time and keeping the second filament of the bulb short<br>
circuited characterised in that both ends of the second filament are connected to<br>
the same eye-let of the cap and hence not allowing the current to flow through<br>
that filament.<br>
2.	The Electrical circuit arrangement as claimed in CLAIM 1 in which in the<br>
metal cap of the said bulb the end of one lead-in-wire of one filament is<br>
electrically connected to one eye-let of the cap and similarly the end of one<br>
lead-in-wire of second filament is electrically connected to the second eye-let<br>
of the cap whereas the ends of the other two remaining lead-in-wires, one from<br>
each filament, are joined together as common wire taken out through a tiny<br>
hole provided in the black glass of metal cap and is electrically connected to<br>
any one of the eye-let at a time through a change over arrangement which<br>
facilitates to put the second filament in operation, after the failure of first<br>
filament, by changing over the change over wire to connect the common wire<br>
to the second eye-let.<br><br></td>
