The present invention relates to cucurbit[n]urils and method for producing said cucurbit[n]urils. The present invention also relates to cucurbit[n]urils, to cucurbit[s, u]urils, and to a method of separating cucurbit[n]urils and/or cucurbit[s, u]urils. The present invention also relates to novel compounds used in the preparation of cucurbit[n]urils and cucurbit[s, u]urils.<br><br>
Cucurbituiji is the name given to a cyclic oligomer formed by 3inl~.ng six (6) glyzoliirii units via methylene bridges. Cacurbituri1 was first described in the literature in 1905 in a paper by R. Behrenel, E. Meyer and F. Rusohe, Leibigs Ami. ~hem• ; 339, 1,2905. The macrocyclic sTh~cture of cucurbituril was first described it 1981 by WA Freeman et. aL, "Cucurbituril" J. Am.. Ohern. Soc., 103 (1981),<br>
7367-7368.	Cucurbituril has •a chemical formula of CH36NO12 ~nd is a inacrocyclac compound having a central cavity. An AMI. -mnnm1~e~ .s~wucture of cucu.rbituril is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The internal cavity of cucurbituril has ~ diameter of about .550 pm, a depth of 650 pm with portals at either end about 400 ~m across. This rigic~ cavity TZias been shown to have high selectively in binding a variety of medium-small molecules and in this regard reference is made to Cintas, P., 1. Inclusion Phenomena and Molecvi.ar Recognition in Chemisty; I7~ 205, 1994<br>
The preparatioh of cucurbituril has generally followed the procedure first described in the article byR. 3ehrend et, a.L published in .1.905.<br>
In German patent no' DE 196 0377, published 7 August 1997~ a process for synthesising cucurbitu.ril is described. This process includes dissolving acetylene diur~a (glycoluril) in an aqueous solution of a strong mineral acid in the presence of excess formaldehyde, with war~ning. The wateZ is evaporated from the mixture to completely eliminate the water from the mixtute. The remaining polymer mixture is then. heated to a temperature. up to 1450C to~ complete the reaction. The applicants for this patent have stated that a yield of up to 824% of the theoretical yield can. be obtained.<br><br><br><br>
LEn German patent no. DE 4001139, the use of cucurbituril to remove organic compounds with hydrophobic groups, dyes. decomposition products from dyes and/or heavy metals from aqueous solutions is described. The patent actually states that a cyclic oligomer which is obtained by condensation of urea. thiourea. derivates of urea and/or derivatives of the thiourea with dialdehydes and formaldehyde is used. Although the patent states that the degree of polymerisation. n, of the cyclic oligomer varies between about 3 and about 8. the examples of the patent showing cyclic o1i~omers having a degree of polymerisation. n. only of 6. Example 1 shows the preparation of cucurbituril by heating glycoluril under reflux with formaldehyde.<br><br>
Experiments conducted by the present inventors in fol1owin~ the procedure of Example 1 of DE 4001139 have shown that cucurbituril having 6 g1~coluri1 units joined together is formed. In the words of DE 4001139. n~6 for this product. No evidence was found of any cyclic oligomer having a degree of polvmerisation, n, other than 6. Indeed, a paper by Buschmann et. al.. Inorgica Chiroica Acta, 1992. 193, 93 states that under the synthetic conditions as described in DL 400 1139, only cucurbituril having a degree of polymerisation. n, of 6 is formed.<br><br>
The present inventors have now developed a method for producing cucurbiturils having a degree of polymerisation of 4 to 12. To assist in differentiating such compounds. the present inventors have adopted the terminology "cucurbit[n]uril"' where n is a number from 4 to 12, to: denote the different compounds. For example, a cyclic oligomer having 4 basic glycoluril (substituted or unsubstituted). units joined together would be denoted as "cucurbit [4]uril". <br><br><br><br><br><br>
In a first aspect. the present invention provides a cucurbit[n]uril having the formula (I)<br><br><br><br>
whereinn=~4to 12.<br><br>
and wherein. for each unit of the formula (IL<br><br><br><br>
making up the cucurbit[n]uril, R1 and R2 are independently selected from H, an optionally substituted straight chain, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical or a heterocyclyl radical, or R1 and R2 form a cyclic hydrocarbon radical or heterbcyclyl radical, but excluding unsubstituted cucurbit[6]uril and decamethylcucurbit[5]uril.<br><br><br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for producing a cucurbit[n]uril, where n is from 4 to 12. but excluding unsubstituted cucurbit [6]uril and decamethyl cucurbitli5]uril which comprises mixing substituted and/or unsubstituted g1~coiuri1 with an acid and a compound that can form methylene bridges between glycoluril units;<br><br>
and optionally a templating compound selected from ammQnium chloride, lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, rubidium chloride, caesium chloride. ammonium bromide, lithium bromide, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, rubidium bromide. caesium bromide, lithium iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, rubidium iodide. caesium iodide, potassium sulfate. lithium sulfate. tetrabutviammonium chloride. tetraethylammonium chloride, o-carborane. thioacetamide. N -(1-napthyl) ethyienedianiine. 2,2'-biquinoline, p-bromo aniline. taurine, blue tetrazolium, 2 -amino- 3-methyl benzoic acid, indol-3-aidehvde, cysteine. 4-acetamidoaniline. p-aniinophenol, acetamide. 4-amino acetophenone, 4-dimethvlaminobenzaldehyde, 2-aminobenzimadazole. bis-( 4,4' -bipyridyl)- a,d-p-xylene. red phosphorus and lithium p-toluenesuifonate;<br><br>
and optionally a solvent;<br><br>
and heating the mixture to a temperature of from 20~ to 1200C to thereby form a cucurbit[n]uril.<br><br>
Preferably, n is from 5 to 10.<br><br>
Preferably. the method of the present adding a salt to the mixture. It has a salt to the mixture assists<br><br>
synthesis of a variety of cucurbit[mllurils<br>
invention further comprises been ound that adding<br>
	in	achieving	the<br><br>
of differing unit sizes,<br><br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed, that an ion ternolating effect may be occurring. Thus, 'selection of the particular salt can control the amount of ~. derived cucurbit~n]uril in the product.<br><br>
It has also been found that a number of other compounds can be added to the mixture in place of the salt, or in combination with the salt, to achieve the templating effec: described above. The templating effect causes the relative amount of cucurbit[njurils of differing unit sizes to be altered if the salt or otb.er compound is added to the mixture. For example, the salt or other compound, when added to the reaction m~xnire. may alter the ratio of, say, cucurbitr5~uri1 to cucurbit~6~uxil, when that ratio is compared with the ratio of cuqurbit~5~uri1 to cucurbitF6~u.ril that is produced using reaction mIxtures having no salt or other compound added thereto but otherwise reacted underj i~entica1 conditions.<br>
For ease of descriotion.. such salts and other compounds will be described hereinafter throughout this specification as "templating compounds1'. In a ~roferred embodiment the method of the first aspect of the present invention further compnses adding one or more tempiating compounds to the mixture,<br><br>
The emniating zom~ounds can be selected from a large number of compounds and indeed any compounc~ that can alter the ratio of cu.curbit~n.~urils of different unit sizes produced in the method of the present fttventio~t can be used as a tempiating compound. The rempiating compound may be an organic compound, a salt of an organic compound, or an .iuorganic compound. Suitable compounds that may be used as a templating compound include ammoniuz chloride, lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, rubidium chloride, caes.iu.tn chloride, amnionium chloride, lithium bromide, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, rubidium bromide, caesium bromide, litbi.um iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, rubidium iodide, caesium iodide, potassium sulfate, lithium sulfate, tetrabutylarnmonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, O-carb orane, thioacetantide, N- (2. -napthyl) ethylenediamine, 2,2 -biquinoyl, p-bromoanal.ine, taurine, blue tetrazolium, 2-antino-3-methyl benzoic acid, indol-3-aldehyde, cystine. p.-acetamidoanitine p-aminophenol, acetamide, 4-acetami doaiutine, p-aminophenol, acetamide, 4- amino acetopben.one, 4-dimethylaininobenzaldehyde, 2-<br><br><br>
aminobenzimadazol, bis-(4,4'-bi~yridy1~ )-~. o~-p-xylene, red phosphorus, and lithium p-toluenesulfonate. The present inventors believe fhat a large number of other compounds couk be suitable for use as templating compounds and therefore the above list should no: be considered to be exhaustive, The anions of the acid may also be considered to be a template.<br><br>
The tetnplating eomoounds may be added singly to the reaction rnxtu~e or ~wo or more tempiatng compounds may be added to the reaction mixture<br>
L~ a salt is used as the templating compound salt that is added to the mixture is preferably a metal balide, ammonium halide, or the corresponding suiphates. or metal tos-Aates, It is preferred that the anion of the salt corresponds to the anion of the acid used. For example, where the acid tised is hy&amp;oohlorie acid, a metal chloride or ammonium chloride is the preferred salt, If sulphuric acid is used, metal sulphate or ammoniun sulphate is the preferred salt, Similarly, iodide-containing salts are ~referabiy used where hvdriodic acid is the acid, and bromide-containing salts are preferably used where hydrobromic acid is used.<br><br>
The acid, is vreferably a strong mineral acid or a strong organic acid. I:<br>
principle, any acid can ~e usec~ The acid acts to catalyse the reactions ta~.ng place.<br><br>
Preferred acids for use ~n the ~nethod of the first aspect of the ~resenz invention include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobrounic acid, hydrojodic acid, deuterated sulfuric acid. phosphoric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and methane sulfonic acid. I: will be appreciated that this list is not exhaustive and that any acid that can catalyse the reaction may be used in the method of the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
It is especially preferred that the acid has a concen~atiozt of at least 5 M.<br>
In some embodiments of the first aspect of the present invention, a solvent may aIsb be added to the reaction mixture. The solvent is preferably selected from trifluoroacetic acid, methanesuffonic acid, and 1,1, l-~-ifluorethanoi.<br><br>
The compound that can form merhylene bridges between gycoluril units is most preferably formaldehyde, Daraformaldehyde, ~ioxane or one or more precursors for formaldehyde. For convenience, the invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the case where formaldehyde is used.<br><br><br>
The mixture is preferably heated to temperarure of from 20CC to 11 000, more preferably 600C to I 10~0, most preferably from R0~C to Ii 0CC, It is preferred that boiling of the mixture is avoided, Heating under reflux~ as required in the prior art, is not requfred (but may be use d~. Such temperature conditions are much milder than those u.tiiised in the prior art synthesis process that led to the formation of cucuroitf6Nrii. The prior art processes involved heating the mixmre t.inder reflux follo~'ed by heating to temperatures of up to 145 to 1650C. At room temperatures the present inventors have found that, cucurbit[n]urii was formed only if concentrated sulphuric acid was used as the acid. It has been found that the mixture should, generally be heated to a temperature cf 6000 and above to produce cucarbit~njurils, with increased yields being obtained at temoeratures on the range of 8000 to 1000C.<br><br>
The glycolurils that are used in the ~resen: invention have an unsubstitured structure ~s shown in :or~ula I beiow~The general structure for ~he cucurbitfnlurils synthesised in accordance with the process of the present invention iS shown in formula 2 below<br><br><br>
wherein n = 4 to 1.2, preferably 4 to 10.<br>
(Formula 2)<br><br><br>
Substituted and unsubstituLed glycolurils, or a n~,i,~ure thereof, zn~y be used to synthesise cucurnitrnjuril in accor~.snce with the present invention, Substituted glycolurils have the general formula as shown in formula below:<br><br>
(Formula 3)<br><br>
wherein k1 and P~ are the same or different and selected front an optionally substituted strai~hr chain, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical or R~, and R2form a cyclic hydrocarbon radical. The hydrocarbon radical for substituents Th and R2 may include alkyl, alkertyl, alkynyl, aryl and heterocyclyl radicals, There are large numbers of substituted glycolurils l~own in the literature, Particular reference is made to a review article by Harm Petersen in Synthesis4 1 923, 243-293, which contains a list of about 30 substituted glycoiurils~ The entire contents of this review article are hereby e~press1y incorporated into this specification by cross reference, The literature since the Petersen article has disclosed several other examples of substituted glycolurils and it is believed that essentially any o.4~-diketone could he used to make a glycoluril.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(Formula 7)<br>

Invesugarions conducted by present inventors have shown that :ucurbit~n2uri1-1ike systems can be synthesised with marv of the substituted glycolurils, preferably when used, in conjunctior. with unsubstituted glycoiur~1s. The following substituted glycolutil compounds have been prepared and used to synthesise substituted cucurbitrlurils:<br>
	(Formula 4)	(Formula 5)<br><br><br>
ula 6)<br><br>
The compounds of forinu.lae 5, 6 and 7 above are 'novel and accordingly, in another aspect,<br><br>
the present invention provides a substituted glycoluni compound of formula 5, formula 6<br><br>
or formula 7.<br><br>
The synthesis of substituted cucurbit[njurils opens the possibility of being able to chemically link the substituted cucurbitlnjuril to a substz'ate or to chemisorb them onto a substrate, The solubility characteristics of the product znay also be manipulated by selection of appropriate substituents.<br>
As mentioned earlier, cucurbitE6]uri2. was first cheracterised and synthesised in<br>
1905. ~ioweyer, the present inventors believe that cucurbit[njuril. where n—4, 5, 7, 8, 9,<br><br>
IC, 11 or 12 has never previously been synthesised. Accordingly, in a fu~her aspect, the<br>
present invention provides cucurbit[njurL, where n = 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2.1 or 12,<br><br>
Preferably, n = 5,7, B, 9 or 10.<br><br><br>
The presen: also. provides substituted cucurbit~n3uriis, where r. = 4, 5. ~, 7, B, 9, 1.0, IL or 12. lo order to clarify nomenclature when substituted cucurbiturils are forme&amp; t~e presen: inventors have ~roDose.d that substituted cucurbiturlis it. accordance with the present invention be identified, by the scheme "cuctzbliEs,uluril", ~'here s the number or substituted glycoluril units and u = the number of unsubstituted glycoluril units in the cucuroituriL Using this nomenclature, the present invention also provi cucurbit~s,.uThrii, where s and u are as de~ned above and s-~-u=~ to 2.2, preferaciv 5 'tc 10.<br>
In all of the experimental work conducted by the present invez~tors •ro date in relation to substituted cucu~oiturils1, the substituted cucurbiturils have incorporated both substituted and unsubstituted glycoluril units into the cucu~bituril structure. Thus, it is prefez~ed that u does not equal zero. If s e~uais zero, cucurbit[s,~Juril is equivalent to cucurbitlnlurils, The substituted cucurbitlinjurils are preferably synthesized from substituted g~yco}uri1. or amixture of substituted and unsubstituted glyc~luril. The substituents may be as described above,n order  show the structure of cucurb4n~uri. in cases where n = 4. 5, 7 or 8, zliaimised chemical structures were Drepared using ?C-Sparan. a rnoiecuiar modelling and visualisation package. The mini~ised structures are shown as formulae S tc K below:<br><br>

The inimnsed structures of Pormu~ae S to 11 clea&amp;~ show the inner cavity of the eucurbituril. As the value o: n increases, the stze of the inner cavity increases" w~ch enables different compotuids to fit into the inner cavity.<br><br>
The reaction product of the process of the ~resenr ~nvenho: contains a mix~ure of di~erent cucurbitLn]u.riis or cucurbitFs,u}uriis. There ~e several methods that could be used to seDarate and purify these products and these are described below<br><br><br>
Successive Recrystalltsation<br><br>
All of the cuoc it~n~ urils that have been obse~red are apparently soluble in acid solutions. Oucur'bitF5 or 7 or ~ or 1 0~uril have been purified by successive recrystallisations from acid solutions. Eecause of the siiniiar nature of the cucurbiturils. this is a ato~w process with more than 10 recrvstaflisations recuired to '~urLfy cu&amp;~rbit7Jurfl, As shown in the German patents zucurbit~6Jur2 can be obtained in a relatively pure state from ~ single recystallisation process.<br><br>
Selective disso1utionIpreci~itation<br><br>
We have been able to demonstrate that different cucurbiturils have mark.ediy different solubilities in various salt solutions. It is possible to separate cucurbit~6j.uril and cucurbitf7jurii from a tixture contaimng cucurbit[5-8~urils by dissolving cucurbitL~ or 7]uril out of the con~plex mixture using a 0.1M Na2 304 solution.<br>
We have also demonstrated the use of selective precipitation as a purification method. A solution of cucurbit[6Jurii and cuourbit~7Juril was mixed with bis(4~~,ct-z-xylene with several crystals depositing out of the saxnole.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention comprises separating a mixture of cucurbit[n]urils. where n = 4 to .2, by mixing the mixture of eucurbit~njurils with a salt solution in whic1'~ at least one of the cucurbit~n2uriis, but not all of the cucurbit[n]urils, dissolves, separating solids ir. which at least one of the cucurbit~nJuri1s, but not all of the cucit~n~urils, dissolves, separating solids from the solution recovering the dissolved at least one cucurbitfn3utils from the solution. This method may also be used to sevarate mixtures of different substituted cucurbit[s,ujurlLs.<br><br>
As ar. example, Utbiuit chloride ir. hydrochloric acid solutions selective&gt; assists the crvstaliisa:ion of zucurbi:~6]urii and '-cucurbitfSjuri leaving cucurbizF5]ut'L and cucurbit~T]uri in solution.<br>
Potassium chloride in hydrochloric acid solutions seiect~ve1y assists the crystallisanon of cucurbit~5~uri and cucuroit~Sjuri1 ieavit~g cucurbit~6~uril and cucar~it(7]uri1 ui solution,<br>
Any of the salt compie~~ed cucurbit[n~uriis can be separated from their salt b~' a process of desalting or ion exchange resins such as Dowel 50. Dissolved in formic 'acid water, the mixtures are loaded onto the resin and the salts eluted with dilute drochioric acid/formic acid solutions until satisfactory salt removal and ther. the final recovery of the cucurbit[njuril is achieved by elution with 5M or higher of aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br><br>
Chrornatographic Separation<br><br>
&amp;tb Thin Layer Ohomatography (The and Kigh Pressure Uquid Chromatography (LC have demonstrated ability to separate out various oligomers of cuuroit~n~nri1. 3och of these systems are under continuing invest~gat1om TLC using -a silica stationary phase and 0. IM Hydrochloric acid as the mobile phase resulted in a mixture of cucu:bit[n~urils se~rating into several bands, HPLC separation has beer. attempted using a C—2.~ stationary phase and C.5M Na2SO4 mobile chase. The retention times of :ecrysta.ilised samples of cucurbit~6~urll arid cucurbit[7~urii were comparable with peaks foi.2nd in mixed samples of crude cucurbit~nJurils.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides amethod for separating a mixture of cueurbitLn1uriis~ where = 4 to 10. by dissolving the mixture of cucurbitLn]uril~ ~nd subjecting the thus- ted solution of cucurbit[rijurils to chromatographic separation. This method tu.ay also be used to separate mixtures of cueurbit[sj~urils.<br>
In addition, rolymer resins as chromatographic supports, such as, Dowex or Sephadex ion exchange columns or polyanilnes arc effective :n the purification of cucurbit~n~urils. The eluant most commonly used was, 30-50% acucous formic acid or a mixture of fo~nic acid 98% and aqueous hydrochloric acid 0.5M in a. ratio of 1:2 respectively. Samples sizes of to 2 gin were able to be purified on a b~d of 25cm of resin,<br>
In order to more fully understand the present invention, the proposed reaction mechanism will be discussed hereunder i: is to be understood that the following reaction<br><br><br>
mechanism is a proposed mechanism and the present invention should no; be considered to be limited thereto. The proposed reaction me.chanism hereunder should be rca: z conjunction with Figures la. Ib, to and Id,<br>
The synthesis of cucurbitfn~uril or substicared cuzurbit&gt;JurL (where r. equals the nuinoer of glycouuli units marking up cuourbirarit is an acid caralysed process. In the mechanism detailed below the first important intermediate 1 has bee: isolated and is the reaction of a glycoluril with four equivalents of formaldehyde. The dehydration of this retro to. the cyclic diether 2 has been demons~ated by the isolation of pure 2 where R = pheny&gt; The intermediates .~ or B are both produced through a series of acid catalysed steos. This mechanism is not prescriptive, as it is nossibie for either A or B to be produced<br>
Similarly, it<br>
without going througt 1 or 2.	- is possible for glycoluril units to begin linking<br>

-. Following the addition of formaldehyde there. is an. exotherziic reaction. On larger scale the reaction inixture is cooled in an ice bath. Formaldehyde can be substimted by paraforxnaldehvde or trioxane or any formaldehyde producii~g precursor.<br><br>
2. ?roceeding to the ne~; stage of the reaction procedure after lhr or 1 month a: room temperature makes little difference to the our come except in the case of concentrated sulphufic acid where the reaction continues to cucurbit~n2urils a: room temperature.<br><br><br>
3. A reaction temperature of 6O~C and above is sufficient to give cucurbit~nJurUs but at the lower temperatures with extended reaction times to achieve completion, up to SDhrs. The given yields above for the larger unit oueurbit(&gt;=7L~ril are on average increased a further 50% on the tabled yields.<br><br>
.~n some cases pressure was generated during heating. In the e'vent of a -pressure build u~ the pressure was released<br><br><br>
5.	The repeated dissolving and evaporation was primarily carried out to remove excess formaldehyde and volatile formaldehyde by products.<br><br><br>

A mixture of tetracyclic ether B (2.5 nunol) and glycoluril (0.355 gin, 2.5 namol) was dissolved or suspended in the appropriate acid (6~9tnl) (note 1). Then in the cases where a salt was used to maninulate reaction products the alkali metal ion or ammonium salt (Sinmol) with rite corresponding anion appropriate to the acid was added Heat was then applied to the reaction mixture, which was maintained at a temperature of 1 O0~C for 3hrs (Note 2). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and th~ products were isolated by adding methanol (lOmi) and collecting the resultant precipitate by filtration. The solid material was washed with methanol ~nd acetone and air dried, Further<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
purification was effected bx recrystafisatior. from aqueous hydrochloric acid or hvdrobromac acid or dissolving in formic at and precipitating by the addiuor."o-f water.<br>

Analysis of Cucurbituril Mixture<br>

The results of this Table are graphieaflv shown in Figures and 3, Using this info~atior.. the inventors have now identified zuourbit[]uril (methine carbon<br>
73.45	p~rn and methylene carbon ~5.42 ppm) in standard reaction nii~tures. Cucurbit[ Ijuril and cucurbitF 12)uril have only been observed by the methylene carbon when ~C labeLed formaldehyde was used as a reactant. Under these conditions the ouourbitfll2uru methylene carbon was observed at 56.86 p~m and the cucurbitf2~uril metbylene carbon was observed at 5775 ppm.<br><br>
The inventors have routnely used the integration of ~C MAR over the methine region of the spectra to determine the relative amounts of each cucurbit[n]uzfl in the mixture, In... d.oing so it was assumed that the signs]. response for each species is related to the number of methine carbons for that eucurbit~n]uril and that there is little difference in signal response between the different cucurbit[n3urils. The integration-percent is then directly pro'oortional to the mass percent of each, component.<br><br>

Template function<br><br>
The conrroliin~ factors for achieving the sy~thesis of a variey of cucurbiturils of differing uni sizes are pos:ulate~ tc be primatily derived from a templating effect. For example, a: anion is apparently held in position by a rnetaJ cation or the azninonium ion. The metal cations coordinate to the carbonyls of the forming cucur'oituri: intermediates (such as F, GI. and G2j or in the case of the ainmonium cation is held through hydrogen<br>
•oondin~ to the carbonyls of these intermediates. The iege: iodide anion and its tight pairing witi-. th~ lithium cation favours cucurbit~7juril bu~ for the more diffuse. ion2 pairs of Sodium. potasSium. or rubidium, iodide does not control the size by templating around the anion but rather templating is predominantly controlled by the cation although this effect diminishes as the anion decreases in size. There has been found a common tend where the eouilibriuin shifts by varying combinations of anion and cations. The proton from the acid not only serves as a catalyst but also acts as a cation capable of hydrogen bonding to the carbonyls of the forming cucurbirfnjurL and also ~ontrol1ing the placement of anions, The degree of the competing influence between these protons and any added cations affects the equilibrium and hence the product distribution. Cucurbitfri]unils where n&gt;7 appears to be controlled by a temnoladug around a cation/anion cluster rather than a single ion pair. Electrospray mass spectroscopy of larger cucurbituuils snpports this showing muTh charged cationic complexes.<br>
Further influences upon the equilibrium and hence the product out come is the precipitation of product complexes. For example increasing the concentration by 10 times of a cation such as lithium in sulphuric acid changes the relative proportion of cucuibitL5luril from 5% to 25% as a consequence of the precipitation of the eucurbit[5Juff lithium complexes.<br>
In addition to equilibrium shifts caused by changes to the cation zoncentration the equilibrium is also affected by the formation of the cucurbitt6juril iodine complex which occurs under the reaction conditions where hydriodic acid is used and hydriodic acid<br><br>
decomposes to fort. xod±ine. The ad&amp;rior. of red vhbsnhorus eliminates this effect b~ the in s:w reduction of the iodine generated.<br>
It. addition, we have found tha: a wide range of other inorganic and organic compounds car. be used as templates These affect the equilibriua through a variet of subtle effects including ion-dipole, diople-diopie and hydrogen bonding. hydrophobic and weal: Van der Waals interactions. lr~ essence any material or compound stable to the reecuor conditions could ac: as s. potential template.<br><br><br>
Industrial app hoabii ry<br><br><br>
The potential uses for cucurbitEnjurils axe large with academic. industrial, analytical and pharmaceutical applications As a class these molecules can be favourable compared to the cvziodexn-ins because both molecular systems posses a hydrophobic cavity with polar end caps. Cyclodextrins have been used in a wide range of applications includinz slow release drugs odour entrapment agents in plastic films, and enzinilrnies for synthesis. I: is believed that cucurbit[r3urils will be of use in similar areas where benefit can he taker. of the ability of the cuzurbit~nJurils to take up molecules or compounds into there central cavity.

Cucurbitfn]urils are thermally more robust than cyciodextrins and are stable to strong acid solutions unlike cyciodexuins.<br><br><br>
The present inventors have also found that cucurbit[6~uril and cucurbitFflu.ril can both bind dioxane aqueous solutions, This dioxane binding property can form the basis of processes for the removal of dioxane. According to a fur~her aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a process for removing dioxane from a fluid comprising contacting the fluid with cucurbitf63urii andlor cucurbit['7]uril,<br><br>
The physical removal of dioxane could take place using one of the following techniques:<br><br>
•	Cucurbitl6 or 7]uril bound to a non-reactive solid support (silica or alum.ina) where the dioxane would bind to the cucurbit[6 or 7Juril and then be removed from solution by simple filtratio~ to collect the solid support<br>
•	A solution of cucurbitt6 or 7]uril placed in dialysis tubing which would allow the passage of dioxane into the solution where it would be bound by the cucurbit[6 or 7] uril.<br><br>
•	Incorporation of the cucurbitL6 or 7Juril into a solid clay support and use filtration techniques to remove bound dioxane.<br><br>
•	lnco~oratior. intc a polymer film. lr. this case the dioxane would be entra~ned bY the cucurbit~E or Tluril inside the polmer film When the. capacity of the film has been reached it is simply removed from contact with the product stream,<br><br>
•	In all cases the material itself could be regenerated for repeated use,<br><br><br>
If the dJoxane is contained in the solid, for example in diaxane/contatninared soil, th~ process of this aspec: of the invention may comprise the further sten of wasbin~ the soil wttn a fluid tc thereby cause the dioxane to go into the fluid and subsecuently creating the fluid in accordance with this aspect of the invention.<br><br>

The presenz invention provides a method for producing a range of cucurbitfnjurils and cucurbitLs~ujuriis. The synthesis method results in the production of a number of cucurbit~n]uriJs and cucurbitfs~u]urils that have never before been produced or isoia.ted.. S e~aration is possible via chromatography andlor selective. preci~itation~ The vroduet cucurbizfnlurils and cucurbitfs.u]urils are stable to vigorous reaction conditions over a wide range of p~ values. They are soluble in aqueous acid or aqueous salt solutions. The method gives cucurbitarils in much larger yields than previously possible, The use of templatirig compound.s allows a degree of control over the relative amounts of the different<br>
cucurbitrn]urils being produced.<br>
