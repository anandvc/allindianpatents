CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a Continuation-In-Part Application of US Ser. No 11/301,707 filed December 13, 2005 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/726,409, filed October 13,2005<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to extreme environment compositions comprising<br>
disiloxane surfactant compositions that exhibit resistance to hydrolysis over a wide<br>
pH range. More particularly the present invention relates to such extreme<br>
environment compositions having a resistance to hydrolysis between a pH of about<br>
3 to a pH of about 12,	'<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The topical application of liquid compositions to the surfaces of both animate and inanimate objects to effect a desired change involve the processes of controlling wetting, spreading, foaming, detergency, and the like. When used in aqueous solutions to improve the delivery of active ingredients to the surface being treated, trisiloxahe type compounds have been found to be useful in enabling the control of  these processes to achieve the desired effect. However, the trisiloxane compounds may only be used.in a narrow pH range, ranging from a slightly acidic pH of 6 to a very mildly basic pH of 7.5. Outside this narrow pH range, the trisiloxane compounds are not stable to hydrolysis undergoing a rapid decomposition.<br>

set forth to limit other possible olefinically modified alkyleneoxide components. As used herein the phrase "olefinicalLy modified poly alkyleneoxide" is defined as a molecule possessing one or more alkyleneoxide groups containing one or more," terminal or pendant, carbon-carbon double bonds. The polyether is an olefinically modified polyalkyleneoxide (hereinafter referred to as "polyether") is described by the general formula:<br><br>

Example 8<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the organomodified disiloxane composition of the present invention to reduce aqueous surface tension thereby showing utility as surfactants. Surface tension was measured using a Kruss surface tensiometer, with a sand blasted platinum blade as the sensor. Solutions of the various components were prepared at 0.1 wt% in 0.005M NaCl water (Deionized), as an equilibrium aid.<br>
Table 4 shows that solutions of these unique compositions provide a significant reduction in surface tension relative to the conventional surfactant.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also provide spreading properties similar to the TSAs (E and F), and comparative disiloxane surfactants (A, B, C, D and H). Additionally, organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention provide improved spreading relative to the conventional silicone polyether (G) and conventional organic surfactant product OPE (Table 4).<br>
Spreading was determined by applying a 10 uL droplet, of surfactant solution to polyacetate film (USI, "Crystal Clear Write on Film") and measuring the spread diameter (mm) after 30 seconds, at a relative humidity between 50 and 70% (at 22 to 25°C). The solution was applied with an automatic pipette to provide droplets of<br>
17<br><br>
reproducible volume. Deionized water that was further purified with a Millipore filtration system was used to prepare the surfactant solutions.<br>

Tables 6-16 demonstrates that the compositions of the present invention provide improved resistance to hydrolytic decomposition relative to the standard comparative siloxane-based surfactants siloxanes B and E under similar pH conditions.<br>
Comparative siloxanes B and E show rapid hydrolysis at  pH 7, while the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention demonstrate a higher resistance to hydrolysis under the same conditions.<br>
Although comparative D shows similar resistance to hydrolysis, it does not provide<br>
the enhanced spreading properties associated with the organomodified disiloxane<br>
surfactants of the present invention. For example comparative D gave a spread<br>
diameter of only 6 mm (0.4%) and had 82% product remaining by HPLC, after 48h at<br>
pH4, while the organomodified disiloxane surfactant product 10 gave a spread<br>
diameter of 34 mm and maintained 75% product after lweek, under the same<br>
conditions (Tables 4,11 and 16).	<br>

Unlike traditional siloxane based surfactants, which are subject to rapid hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions (<ph and> pH 9) the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention provide increased resistance to hydrolysis relative to traditional trisiloxane alkoxylates (Comparative E and F), as well as the comparative trimethylsilyl terminated disiloxane surfactants, represented by Comparative B. An artifact of hydrolysis is observed as a reduction in superpsreading properties over time. Therefore solutions of the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention, as well as comparative surfactants were prepared at desired use levels and pH. Spreading was determined as a function of time to illustrate resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
22<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Table 17 is an illustrative example of the organomodified disiloxane surfactants, where product No. 10, has improved resistance to hydrolysis, at pH 3, relative to a traditional trisiloxane ethoxylate superspreading surfactant (Product E). As mentioned above, resistance to hydrolysis was observed by monitoring the spreading properties over time. Here a 0.4 wt% solution was prepared at pH 3, and spreading determined according to the procedure in Example 8.<br>
Table 17-Spreading Properties at pH 3 Vs Time (h)<br><br>
Example 11<br>
In another example the organomodified disiloxane surfactants of the present invention represented by product Nos. 6 and 11, demonstrate improved resistance to hydrolysis relative to product F, a trisiloxane ethoxylate superspreader (Table 18). Solutions ( 0.4wt%) of the surfactants were prepared at pH 4 and pH 5 and spreading properties were observed over time. The test conditions are outlined in Example 8.<br>
23<br>
Table 18- Spreading Properties at pH 4 and pH 5 Vs Time<br><br><br>
Example 12<br>
In another example the organomodif ied disiloxane surfactants of the present invention, represented by product No. 5, shows improved resistance to hydrolysis relative to comparative product E. Here surfactant solutions (0.1wt%) were prepared at pH 4, pH 5, pH 8, pH 9 and pH 10, and the spreading properties over time were observed as,described in Example 8.<br>
Table 19 demonstrates that the comparative silicone E shows a more rapid loss of spreading properties at pH 4, pH 5, pH 9 and pH 10, than product No. 5.<br>
Table 19-Spreading Properties vs. Time<br><br>
Example 13<br>
The impact of other ingredients on spreading was determined by blending the organosilicone disiloxane surfactant of the present invention, with a conventional organic based cosurfactant. The cosurfactants are described in Table 20.<br>
Blends were prepared' as physical mixtures where the weight fraction silicone is represented by a (alpha), indicating that the cosurfactant makes up the balance of the blend ratio. For example when a = 0 this indicates that the composition contains 0% of the silicone component and 100% cosurfactant, while an a = 1.0 indicates the composition contains 100% silicone, and no (0%) cosurfactant. Mixtures of the two<br>
24<br><br>
components are represented by the weight fraction a, where a ranges as follows: 0 
Spreading was determined as described in Example 8, at either 0.1 wt% or 0.2wt% total surfactant.<br>
Table 21 demonstrates that representative examples of the cosurfactants of the present invention provide favorable spreading results, and in some cases provide an unexpected synergistic enhancement, where the spread diameter of the mixture exceeds that of the individual components.<br>
