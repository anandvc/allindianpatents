				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin. More particularly, the present in-<br>
vention is concerned with a polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late resin comprised mainly of trimethylene terephthalate<br>
recurring units, which has the following characteristics:<br>
an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.8 to 4.0 dl/g; a molecu-<br>
lar weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of from 2.0 to 2.7; a<br>
psychometric lightness L-value (L-l) of from 70 to 100<br>
and a psychometric chroma b*-value (b*-l) of from -5 to<br>
25; and a psychometric lightness L-value (L-2) of from 70<br>
to 100 and a psychometric chroma b*-value (b*-2) of from<br>
-5 to 25 as measured after heating the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin at 180 Â°C for 24 hours in air. By<br>
using the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the<br>
present invention, a shaped article having high strength<br>
and excellent color can be stably produced on a commer-<br>
cial scale. Further, the present invention is also con-<br>
cerned with a method for stably producing the poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin with high productivity<br>
on a commercial scale.<br>
Prior Art<br>
A polytrimethylene terephthalate resin (hereinaf-<br>
ter, referred to as "ptt") not only has characteristics<br>
similar to those of a nylon (e.g., soft feeling due to<br>
the low elasticity of the resin, excellent elastic re-<br>
covery and good dyeability), but also has characteris-<br>
tics similar to those of a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "PET") (e.g., wash and<br>
wear property, dimensional stability and discoloration<br>
resistance). Therefore, a PTT has been attracting at-<br>
tention as a raw material which can be used for produc-<br>
ing carpets, clothes, shaped articles and the like.<br>
For further expanding the application fields of a<br>
PTT, it has been desired to improve the strength and<br>
color of the fibers and shaped articles of a PTT.<br>
For improving the strength of the fibers and<br>
shaped articles of a polymer, it is necessary to in-<br>
crease the polymerization degree of the polymer, and to<br>
narrow the molecular weight distribution of the polymer<br>
so as to reduce the amount of low molecular weight<br>
components in the polymer. Further, for improving the<br>
color of the fibers and shaped articles of a polymer,<br>
it is necessary not only to improve the whiteness of<br>
the polymer, but also to improve the heat resistance of<br>
the polymer so as to prevent the discoloration of the<br>
polymer, which is caused by the thermal history experi-<br>
enced by the polymer during the drying, melting and the<br>
like.<br>
As a polymerization method for producing a PTT, a<br>
melt polymerization method is widely known. For exam-<br>
ple, Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Specification No. Hei 5-262862 (corresponding to U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,340,909), WO98/23662, WO01/14450 and<br>
WO01/14451 disclose a method in which a melt polymeri-<br>
zation is performed using a polymerization vessel<br>
equipped with a stirrer. The above-mentioned polymeri-<br>
zation vessel has advantages in that it exhibits excel-<br>
lent volume efficiency and has a simple structure.<br>
Such a polymerization vessel can be used on a small<br>
scale for efficiently performing a polymerization to<br>
produce a polymer having a high polymerization degree.<br>
However, when the above-mentioned polymerization vessel<br>
is used for performing a polymerization on a commercial<br>
scale, the depth of the liquid reaction mixture in the<br>
polymerization vessel inevitably becomes deep, leading<br>
to a marked occurrence of heat decomposition of the<br>
polymer. Thus, a polymer having high polymerization<br>
degree cannot be produced on a commercial scale.<br>
Various techniques have been proposed for produc-<br>
ing a PTT having a high polymerization degree by melt<br>
polymerization. Examples of such techniques include a<br>
technique in which a lower alcohol diester of<br>
terephthalic acid and trimethylene glycol are subjected<br>
to a transesterification reaction and a polycondensa-<br>
tion reaction in the presence of a titanium compound,<br>
wherein the molar ratio of the lower alcohol diester of<br>
terephthalic acid to trimethylene glycol is in the<br>
range of from 1/1.2 to 1/1.8 (Unexamined Japanese Pat-<br>
ent Application Laid-Open Specification No. Sho 51-<br>
140992); a technique in which an organometal catalyst<br>
is used as a polycondensation catalyst, and an organic<br>
sulfonic acid or an aliphatic carboxylic acid is used<br>
as a catalyst auxiliary (U.S. Patent No. 4,611,049); a<br>
technique in which a tin catalyst is used as a polycon-<br>
densation catalyst (Unexamined Japanese Patent Applica-<br>
tion Laid-Open Specification No. Hei 5-262862 (corre-<br>
sponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,340,909)),- a technique in<br>
which a specific titanium catalyst is used as a poly-<br>
condensation catalyst (Unexamined Japanese Patent Ap-<br>
plication Laid-Open Specification Nos. 2000-159875 and<br>
2000-159876); a technique in which an antimony compound<br>
is used as a polycondensation catalyst (Chemical Fiber<br>
International Vol. 46, pp 263-264, 1996); a tech-<br>
nique in which heat decomposition of a PTT is sup-<br>
pressed by using a hindered phenol-type stabilizer hav-<br>
ing a specific structure (Unexamined Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open Specification No. Sho 51-142097);<br>
and a technique in which the by-production of acrolein<br>
(formed by heating of a prepolyiner and a polymer in air<br>
during the polymerization) is suppressed by blocking<br>
the terminals of the prepolymer and the polymer with a<br>
phosphorus-containing stabilizer and a hindered phenol<br>
-type stabilizer (WO98/23662 and WO99/11709). However,<br>
the above-mentioned techniques are disadvantageous in<br>
that the molecular weight of the obtained PPT is not<br>
satisfactorily high, in that a lowering of the molecu-<br>
lar weight of the PTT occurs during the molding thereof,<br>
and/or in that a discoloration of the PTT occurs. Thus,<br>
by the above-mentioned techniques, a PTT having satis-<br>
factory properties cannot be obtained.<br>
Further, a method is proposed in which, for the<br>
purpose of obtaining a high molecular weight PTT which<br>
exhibits excellent heat stability during the spinning<br>
of the PTT, a solid-phase polymerization of a PTT pre-<br>
polymer having a relatively low molecular weight is<br>
performed, in which the PTT prepolymer has not suffered<br>
heat decomposition and has excellent color (Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
Hei 8-311177, Japanese Patent Application prior-to-<br>
examination Publication (Tokuhyo) No. 2000-502392 and<br>
Korean Patent No. 1998-061618). However, the solid-<br>
phase polymerization proceeds while releasing<br>
trimethylene glycol (hereinafter, referred to as "TMG")<br>
from the surface of pellets of the prepolymer during<br>
the polymerization reaction. Therefore, the polymeri-<br>
zation degree varies depending on the size and shape of<br>
the pellets, and also varies depending on the position<br>
in the pellets. Therefore, the PTT obtained by this<br>
method is markedly non-uniform with respect to the po-<br>
lymerization degree. Further, in the solid-phase po-<br>
lymerization, the pellets of the solid prepolymer get<br>
rubbed with one another over a long period of time,<br>
thereby generating a polymer powder which becomes a<br>
loss. Furthermore, in the above-mentioned method, the<br>
solid-phase polymerization should be conducted after<br>
the production of the prepolymer by the melt polymeri-<br>
zation and the like, and thus, the entire process for<br>
producing a PTT becomes complicated and costly. Still<br>
further, the presence of the polymer powder in the<br>
spinning process causes breakage or fuzzing of polymer<br>
fibers. For removing the polymer powder, an addition<br>
step therefor becomes necessary.<br>
As a method for producing a PTT having a high po-<br>
lymerization degree only by melt polymerization, a<br>
technique has been proposed in which the polymerization<br>
is performed using a disc ring reactor or a cage type<br>
reactor (WO00/64962) or a disc and donut conductor (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,599,900) to withdraw the TMG efficiently<br>
from the reaction system. However, each of the above-<br>
mentioned apparatuses is a horizontal agitation-type<br>
polymerizer which is equipped with a rotary driving<br>
part. Therefore, in the above-mentioned method, when a<br>
polymerization is performed under a high vacuum for ob-<br>
taining a polymer having a high polymerization degree,<br>
it is impossible to seal the driving part completely.<br>
Thus, it is impossible to prevent the intrusion of a<br>
trace amount of oxygen into the polymer, and hence, a<br>
discoloration of the polymer inevitably occurs. Espe-<br>
cially, in the case of a PTT, such discoloration mark-<br>
edly occurs. When the driving part is sealed with a<br>
sealing liquid, it is likely that the sealing liquid<br>
gets mixed with the polymer, thereby lowering the qual-<br>
ity of the resultant PTT. Further, even when the driv-<br>
ing part of the apparatus is tightly sealed at the<br>
start of the operation thereof, the tightness of the<br>
sealing is lowered during the operation conducted for a<br>
long period of time. Thus, the above-mentioned method<br>
also has a serious problem with respect to the mainte-<br>
nance of the apparatuses.<br>
On the other hand, a method for producing a resin<br>
(other than PTT) is known in which the polymerization<br>
apparatus used therein does not have a rotary driving<br>
part, and a polymerization is performed by allowing a<br>
prepolymer to fall from a perforated plate (free-fall<br>
polymerization method).<br>
For example, a method is disclosed in which a<br>
polyester prepolymer is allowed to fall in the form of<br>
fibers in vacuo in an attempt to obtain a polyester<br>
having a desired molecular weight (U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,110,547). In this method, a polymerization reaction<br>
is performed in a one pass mode without recycling the<br>
polymer, because the recycling of a polymer which has<br>
already been allowed to fall in the form of fibers<br>
causes the lowering of the quality of the final polyes-<br>
ter. However, the above-mentioned method has the fol-<br>
lowing disadvantages. The polymer in the form of fi-<br>
bers are easily broken during the polymerization reac-<br>
tion, thereby causing a disadvantageously large varia-<br>
tion in quality of the final condensation polymer prod-<br>
ucts. In addition, a low molecular weight condensation<br>
polymer is scattered from the polymer fibers during the<br>
polymerization reaction to stain the lower surface of<br>
the perforated plate. Due to such staining of the<br>
lower surface of the perforated plate, it becomes dif-<br>
ficult to cause the polymer to fall in the form of fi-<br>
bers, so that the polymer fibers contact with one an-<br>
other to cause breakage of the polymer fibers or the<br>
polymer fibers are combined together to form a thick<br>
fiber in which the reaction does not proceed effi-<br>
ciently.<br>
In order to solve these problems, various methods<br>
have been proposed. Examples of such methods include a<br>
method in which a polyester or a polyamide is produced<br>
by allowing a prepolymer to fall along and in contact<br>
with the surface of a perforated guide or a wire guide,<br>
which is vertically arranged in a reaction vessel, so<br>
that the polymerization of the prepolymer is effected<br>
during the fall thereof (Examined Japanese Patent Ap-<br>
plication Publication No. Sho 48-8355 and Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
Sho 53-17569); a method for continuously condensation-<br>
polymerizing bis-(Ã-hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (which<br>
is an initial-stage condensation product of polyethyl-<br>
ene terephthalate (PET)), in which bis-(Ã-hydroxyalkyl)<br>
terephthalate is allowed to fall along and in contact<br>
with wire guides in an atmosphere of inert gas, wherein<br>
the wire guides are hung vertically from the holes of a<br>
perforated plate, so that the polymerization of bis-(Ã-<br>
hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate is effected during the fall<br>
thereof (Examined Japanese Patent Application Publica-<br>
tion No. Hei 4-58806); and a method for producing a<br>
melt-polycondensation polymer, such as a polyester, a<br>
polyamide and a polycarbonate, in which a melt<br>
-polycondensation prepolymer is caused to absorb an in-<br>
ert gas, and then, polymerized under reduced pressure<br>
(WO99/65970 which also discloses an apparatus used in<br>
the method).<br>
However, each of the above patent documents only<br>
describes a method for producing a polyester, such as a<br>
PET, or nylon, and has no proposal or suggestion about<br>
the production of a PTT. As a result of the studies of<br>
the present inventors, it has been found that, when any<br>
of the above-mentioned methods are simply applied to<br>
the production of a PTT (that is, when the production<br>
of a PTT is conducted by the above-mentioned methods,<br>
using raw materials and conditions which are conven-<br>
tionally used in the production of a PTT), a foaming of<br>
a polymer vigorously occurs, thereby staining the lower<br>
surface of the perforated plate or the inner wall of<br>
the reaction vessel having the guides provided therein.<br>
A PTT is susceptible to heat decomposition, as compared<br>
to a PET. Therefore, the stain caused by the above<br>
-mentioned vigorous foaming of the polymer is easily<br>
decomposed. When the resultant decomposition products<br>
get mixed with the polymer, disadvantages are caused in<br>
that the quality of the polymer is lowered, in that the<br>
desired polymerization degree cannot be obtained, and<br>
in that the obtained PTT suffers discoloration. Fur-<br>
ther, the simple application of the above-mentioned<br>
methods to the production of PTT is accompanied by<br>
problems in that it is difficult to achieve a satisfac-<br>
torily high polymerization degree, and in that the fi-<br>
nal PTT contains low molecular weight polymers, which<br>
result in a broad molecular weight distribution of the<br>
final polymer and are likely to lower the mechanical<br>
strength of an ultimate shaped article.<br>
As mentioned above, the conventional methods for<br>
producing a PTT have the following problems:<br>
(1) It is difficult to produce a PTT having a high<br>
polymerization degree only by melt polymerization (i.e.,<br>
without solid-phase polymerization) on a commercial<br>
scale. When the production of a PTT is conducted by<br>
solid-phase polymerization, disadvantages are caused in<br>
that the molecular weight distribution of the obtained<br>
PTT becomes too broad, and in that the production proc-<br>
ess becomes complicated and costly (due to the loss<br>
caused by the formation of polymer powder).<br>
(2) When it is attempted to produce a PTT having high<br>
polymerization degree by using a specific catalyst or<br>
stabilizer, the obtained polymer is likely to suffer<br>
heat decomposition and discoloration.<br>
With respect to the free-fall method (in which a<br>
polymerization is performed by allowing a prepolymer to<br>
fall freely in the form of fibers from a perforated<br>
plate) and the guide-wetting fall method (in which a<br>
polymerization is performed by allowing a prepolymer to<br>
fall along and in contact with a guide), it is known<br>
that these methods can be used for producing polyamide<br>
and polyesters (such as a PET) other than a PTT. How-<br>
ever, the application of the above-mentioned methods to<br>
the production of a PTT is not known, and a PTT having<br>
satisfactory properties cannot be obtained by a simple<br>
application of these methods to the production of a PTT<br>
which is different from the above-mentioned polyamides<br>
and other polyesters with respect to the melt viscosity,<br>
and resistance to heat decomposition, and volatilities<br>
of by-products.<br>
For these reasons, there has been a demand for the<br>
development of a method which can be used for producing<br>
an excellent PTT having a high polymerization degree on<br>
a commercial scale, which PTT can be used for stably<br>
producing a shaped article having excellent strength<br>
and color.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this situation, the present inventors have made<br>
extensive and intensive studies with a view toward<br>
solving the above-mentioned problems accompanying the<br>
prior art techniques. As a result, it has unexpectedly<br>
been found that, by polymerizing a molten form of a<br>
specific trimethylene terephthalate prepolymer by the<br>
so-called "guide-wetting fall process" at a temperature<br>
of from the crystalline melting point of the prepolymer<br>
to 290 Â° C, it becomes possible to produce a specific<br>
excellent polytrimethylene terephthalate resin which<br>
can be used for stably producing a shaped article<br>
exhibiting excellent strength and color. The above-<br>
mentioned specific polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
is composed mainly of recurring units of trimethylene<br>
terephthalate, and has the following characteristics:<br>
an intrinsic viscosity [n] of from 0.8 to 4.0 dl/g; a<br>
molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of from 2.0 to<br>
2.7; a psychometric lightness L-value (L-1) of from 10<br>
to 100 and a psychometric chroma b*-value (b*-l) of<br>
from -5 to 25; and a psychometric lightness L-value (L-<br>
2) of from 70 to 100 and a psychometric chroma b*-value<br>
(b*-2) of from -5 to 25 as measured after heating the<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate resin at 180 Â° C for 24<br>
hours in air. The present invention has been completed,<br>
based on these novel findings.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present inven-<br>
tion to provide a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
which can be used for stably producing a shaped article<br>
having excellent strength and color on a commercial<br>
scale.<br>

Hereinbelow, the present invention is described in<br>
detail.<br>
The polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the<br>
present invention comprises:<br>
90 to 100 mole % of trimethylene terephthalate re-<br>
curring units, and<br>
0 to 10 mole % of at least one monomer unit se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of monomer units ob-<br>

The polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the<br>
present invention may further comprise: cyclic or chain<br>
oligomers other than polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
resin; monomers, such as dimethyl terephthalate (here-<br>
inafter, referred to as "DMT"), terephthalic acid<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "TPA") and trimethylene<br>
glycol (hereinafter, referred to as "TMG"); and/or any<br>
of various additives, such as a delustering agent, a<br>
thermal stabilizer and a flame retardant.<br>
For obtaining a fiber or a shaped article, which<br>
has excellent strength and color, and which is aimed at<br>
in the present invention, it is necessary not only to<br>
improve the polymerization degree of the polytrimethyl-<br>
ene terephthalate resin while narrowing the distribu-<br>
tion of polymerization degree, but also to improve the<br>
whiteness of the resin while improving the resistance<br>
of the resin against the discoloration at high tempera-<br>
tures .<br>
As a yardstick of the polymerization degree, the<br>
intrinsic viscosity [r|] can be used. For obtaining the<br>
above-mentioned excellent fiber or shaped article,<br>
which has excellent strength, it is necessary that the<br>
resin (used for producing the fiber or shaped article)<br>
have an intrinsic viscosity of 0.8 dl/g or more. On<br>
the other hand, from the viewpoint of improving the<br>
moldability of the resin and the ease in measuring the<br>
amount of the resin in a gear pump, the intrinsic vis-<br>
cosity should not be too high. For this reason, it is<br>
necessary that the intrinsic viscosity [n] be 4.0 dl/g<br>
or less. The intrinsic viscosity [n] is preferably in<br>
the range of from 1.05 to 3.0 dl/g, more preferably<br>
from 1.25 to 2.5 dl/g, still more preferably from 1.3<br>
to 2.0 dl/g.<br>
Further, for improving the strength of the above-<br>
mentioned fiber or shaped article, not only should the<br>
average polymerization degree be high, but also the<br>
amount of a low molecular weight polymer should be low,<br>
namely, the molecular weight distribution should be<br>
narrow. In the present invention, the molecular weight<br>
distribution is expressed in terms of a value (Mw/Mn)<br>
which is calculated by dividing the weight average mo-<br>
lecular weight (Mw) by the number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn), wherein each of Mw and Mn is measured by<br>
gel permeation chromatography. In the present inven-<br>
tion, it is necessary that the Mw/Mn value be 2.7 or<br>
less. The Mw/Mn value is preferably 2.6 or less, more<br>
preferably 2.5 or less, still more preferably 2.4 or<br>
less. In general, the lower limit of the molecular<br>
weight distribution of a condensation polymer is 2.<br>
With respect to the color of the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin, for suppressing the darkening of the<br>
ultimate shaped article and for enabling the resin to ex-<br>
hibit a desired color by the use of a dye or a pigment,<br>
it is necessary that the polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
resin have a psychometric lightness L-value (L-l) of 70<br>
or more and a psychometric chroma b*-value (b*-l) of -5<br>
or more. From the viewpoint of suppressing the discol-<br>
oration of the resin by heat decomposition, it is neces-<br>
sary that the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin have a<br>
psychometric chroma b*-value of 25 or less. There is no<br>
particular limitation with respect to the upper limita-<br>
tion of the (L-l) value, but in general, it is 100. The<br>
(L-l) value is preferably 75 or more, more preferably 80<br>
or more. The (b*-l) value is preferably from -3 to 15,<br>
more preferably from -2 to 10.<br>
Further, from the studies of the present inventors,<br>
it has been found that, for improving the whiteness of<br>
the ultimate shaped article, a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin used for producing a shaped article<br>
should exhibit not only excellent whiteness, but also<br>
excellent resistance to discoloration during the heat-<br>
ing of the resin (e.g., during the high temperature<br>
drying, melt molding or the like of the resin). The<br>
reason for this is not clear, but it is presumed that<br>
the discoloration of the resin is caused by not only<br>
the thermal decomposition of the resin per se, but also<br>
certain substances or functional groups which are in-<br>
evitably contained in the polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late resin. It is considered that the above-mentioned<br>
substances or functional groups are formed by heat de-<br>
composition of a prepolymer (used in the production of<br>
the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin) and/or the<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate resin. However, espe-<br>
cially when the below-mentioned polymerization method<br>
proposed by the present inventors is employed, it is<br>
possible to obtain a polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
resin which has excellent resistance to the discolora-<br>
tion during the heating. The reason for this is con-<br>
sidered as follows. The proposed method is advanta-<br>
geous not only in that the leakage of oxygen into the<br>
polymerization reaction system can be suppressed,<br>
thereby preventing the formation of the above-mentioned<br>
substances and functional groups, but also in that the<br>
surface area of the prepolymer being polymerized in the<br>
polymerizer employed in this method is extremely large<br>
as compared to the case of polymerizers which are con-<br>
ventionally employed for the production of a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin, and the surface of<br>
the prepolymer is efficiently renewed, so that the<br>
above-mentioned substances or functional groups, if any,<br>
can be easily withdrawn from the reaction system.<br>
As a yardstick of the susceptibility to discolora-<br>
tion by heat, the color of a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin after heating at 180 Â°C for 2 4<br>
hours in air can be used. In the present invention,<br>
the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin heated under<br>
the above-mentioned conditions needs to have a psycho-<br>
metric lightness L-value (L-2) of 70 or more, and a<br>
psychometric chroma b*-value (b*-2) of from -5 to 25.<br>
The psychometric lightness L-value (L-2) is preferably<br>
7 5 or more, more preferably 8 0 or more. The psychomet-<br>
ric chroma b*-value (b*-2) is preferably from -4 to 21,<br>
more preferably from -3 to 18, still more preferably<br>
from -2 to 16.<br>
In the present invention, for preventing the hy-<br>
drolysis of the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
even when the shaping of the resin which has not been<br>
fully dried is performed, and for improving the<br>
weatherability of a shaped article of the poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin, it is preferred that<br>
the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the present<br>
invention has a terminal carboxyl group content of not<br>
more than 30 meq/kg (based on the weight of the poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin). The terminal car-<br>
boxyl group content is preferably not more than 20<br>
meq/kg, more preferably not more than 15 meq/kg, still<br>
more preferably not more than 10 meq/kg. It is pre-<br>
ferred that the terminal carboxyl group content is as<br>
small as possible.<br>
The polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the<br>
present invention can be used, for example, for produc-<br>
ing an extrusion-molded article, such as a film or a<br>
sheet. In the production of such an extrusion-molded<br>
article, it is desired that the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin simultaneously satisfies all of<br>
such requirements as a very high molecular weight, a<br>
very narrow molecular weight distribution and a very<br>
low terminal carboxyl group content. Therefore, it is<br>
preferred that the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
for use in the production of an extrusion-molded arti-<br>
cle has an intrinsic viscosity [r\] of from 1.25 to 2.5<br>
dl/g, an Mw/Mn ratio of 2.6 or less and a terminal car-<br>
boxyl group content of 20 meq/kg or less; it is more<br>
preferred that the resin has an intrinsic viscosity [n]<br>
of from 1.30 to 2.0 dl/g, an Mw/Mn ratio of 2.5 or less<br>
and a terminal carboxyl group content of 15 meq/kg or<br>
less; and it is still more preferred that the resin has<br>
an intrinsic viscosity [?] of from 1.30 to 2.0 dl/g, an<br>
Mw/Mn ratio of 2.4 or less and a terminal carboxyl<br>
group content of 10 meg/kg or less. When the produc-<br>
tion of the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin is<br>
conducted by the below-mentioned polymerization method<br>
proposed by the present inventors, the polymerization<br>
rate is high and the surface area of the prepolymer be-<br>
ing polymerized is large. Therefore, not only can the<br>
polymerization degree be improved, but also the termi-<br>
nal carboxyl group content can be lowered to a level<br>
which has never been achieved by the conventional melt<br>
polymerization. Further, in this method, the polymeri-<br>
zation degree can be improved while maintaining a high<br>
piston flowability (the "high piston flowability" means<br>
a property that the flowing resin in the polymerizer<br>
has no local variation of the flow rate, i.e., the<br>
flowing resin as a whole has a uniform flow rate).<br>
Thus, by the proposed method, it is possible to obtain<br>
a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin having a narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution, i.e., a resin which does<br>
not contain polymers having largely different molecular<br>
weights. When a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
is produced by solid-phase polymerization, the resin<br>
produced exhibits a high polymerization degree. How-<br>
ever, in the solid-phase polymerization, the polymeri-<br>
zation degree varies depending on the reaction site in<br>
the pellets (i.e., whether the reaction site is at an<br>
inner portion or outer portion of the pellets), and<br>
also varies depending on the size and shape of the pel-<br>
lets, so that it is very difficult to obtain a polymer<br>
having a narrow molecular weight distribution. By the<br>
proposed polymerization method, it has, for the first<br>
time, become possible to produce a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin which can be suitably used for the<br>
commercial scale production of the above-mentioned ex-<br>
trusion-molded article.<br>
The polytrimethylene terephthalate resin of the<br>
present invention, which is in a molten form obtained<br>
immediately after the production thereof, can be spun<br>
or shaped. Alternatively, the resin can be formed into<br>
pellets, and then re-melted at the time of spinning or<br>
shaping of the resin.<br>
When the resin is used in the form of pellets, it<br>
is desired that the amount of loss is small, and that<br>
the pellets can be extruded uniformly by means of an<br>
extruder. Therefore, it is preferred that each pellet<br>
has an appropriate size, and that the amount of polymer<br>
powder adhering to the surface of the pellets is small.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the<br>
average weight of pellets is from 1 to 1,000 mg per<br>
pellet. The pellets having such an average weight is<br>
advantageous in that uniform extrusion of the pellets<br>
by means of a extrusion molding machine becomes easy,<br>
that the pellets can be handled with ease at the time<br>
of transportation, drying and spinning thereof, and<br>
that the drying rate of the pellets becomes fast. The<br>
average weight of the pellets is more preferably from 5<br>
to 500 mg per pellet, still more preferably from 10 to<br>
200 mg per pellet. With respect to the shape of the<br>
pellet, there is no particular limitation, and the<br>
shape of the pellet may be any of a sphere, a rectangle,<br>
a cylinder and a cone. However, from the viewpoint of<br>
ease in handling of the pellets, it is preferred that<br>
the length of the largest portion of each pellet is 15<br>
mm or less, more advantageously 10 mm or less, still<br>
more advantageously 5 mm or less.<br>
With respect to the polymer powder adhering to the<br>
surface of the pellets, it is preferred that the amount<br>
of the polymer powder is in the range of from 0 to<br>
0.5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the pel-<br>
lets, which powder passes through a 30-mesh filter and<br>
does not pass through a 300-mesh filter. When the<br>
amount of the polymer powder is 0.5 % by weight or less,<br>
not only is the loss decreased, but also it becomes<br>
possible to prevent the clogging of a pneumatic line<br>
(i.e., pipe line in which pellets are transferred by<br>
gas) or a filter of an air-exhaust ventilator attached<br>
to a dryer, and to suppress the pressure variation in<br>
an extruder during the spinning, molding or compounding,<br>
so that ultimate products having a uniform quality can<br>
be easily obtained. It is preferred that the amount of<br>
the polymer powder is as small as possible. From a<br>
practical point of view, the amount of the polymer pow-<br>
der is preferably in the range of from 0 to 0.2 % by<br>
weight, more preferably from 0 to 0.1 % by weight,<br>
still more preferably from 0 to 0.05 % by weight, based<br>
on the total weight of the pellets.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the pellets have a<br>
crystallinity (Xc) of 0 to 40 %, wherein the crystal-<br>
Unity is defined by the following formula:<br>
Xc (%) = {?c X (?s - ?a)}/(?s X (?c - ?a)&gt; X<br>
100<br>
wherein pa is 1.300 g/cm3 which is an amor-<br>
phous density of trimethylene terephthalate<br>
homopolymer, pc is 1.431 g/cm3 which is a<br>
crystal density of trimethylene terephtha-<br>
late homopolymer, and pE represents a den-<br>
sity (g/cm3) of the pellets.<br>
The above-mentioned crystal density of trimethyl-<br>
ene terephthalate homopolymer (1.431 g/cm3) is a theo-<br>
retical value which is calculated from the number of<br>
crystal lattices of trimethylene terephthalate ho-<br>
mopolymer. The above crystal density value (1.431<br>
g/cm3) is described in "Poritorimechirenterefutareto no<br>
Kesshoudanseiritsu (Crystal elasticity of poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate)" ("Zairyou (Material)",<br>
written by Katsuhiko Nakamae, Vol. 35, No. 396, p. 1067,<br>
2000). Further, the amorphous density of trimethylene<br>
terephthalate homopolymer (1.300 g/cm3) is obtained by<br>
measuring the density of a sample amorphous polymer ob-<br>
tained by quenching a trimethylene terephthalate ho-<br>
mopolymer in a molten form. (With respect to the sample<br>
polymer, it can be confirmed that the sample polymer is<br>
amorphous, when no crystal peak is observed in the<br>
analysis of the sample polymer by X-ray diffractorae-<br>
try. )<br>
When the pellets have the above-mentioned crystal-<br>
linity, it becomes possible to prevent a problem which<br>
is unique to a PTT and is unlikely to arise in the case<br>
of other polyesters, such as a PET and a PBT (polybuty-<br>
lene terephthalate), i.e., a problem that pellets be-<br>
come brittle and generate a large amount of polymer<br>
powder during the transportation of the pellets by<br>
means of a pneumatic conveyor or a feeder. It is pre-<br>
ferred that the crystallinity is from 0 to 35 %, more<br>
advantageously from 0 to 30 %.<br>
In the present invention, the crystallinity of a<br>
pellet means an average value of crystallinity values<br>
measured at different portions of the pellet. Specifi-<br>
cally, for example, it is preferred that, when a sur-<br>
face portion of the pellet is cut away from a central<br>
portion of the pellet and crystallinities of these por-<br>
tions are measured, both of the surface portion and the<br>
central portion are in the above-mentioned crystallin-<br>
ity range. Further, it is preferred that the differ-<br>
ence in crystallinity between the surface portion and<br>
the central portion is 40 % or less, more advanta-<br>
geously 30 % or less, still more advantageously 20 % or<br>
less .<br>
For obtaining pellets having the above-mentioned<br>
crystallinity, it is preferred that a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate in a molten form, which is obtained by<br>
polymerization, is extruded into a strand or a sheet,<br>
and, subsequently, the obtained strand or sheet is im-<br>
mersed in a coolant, such as water, to cool the strand<br>
or sheet, followed by cutting of the strand or sheet to<br>
obtain pellets. It is preferred that the temperature<br>
of the coolant is 20 Â°C or less, more advantageously<br>
15 Â°C or less, still more advantageously 10 Â°C or less.<br>
From the viewpoint of economy and ease in handling of<br>
the pellets, it is preferred to use water as a coolant.<br>
Naturally, the temperature of water as a coolant is<br>
0 Â°C or more. It is preferred that the cutting to ob-<br>
tain pellets is performed with respect to the strand or<br>
sheet solidified by cooling the extruded strand or<br>
sheet to 55 Â° C or lower within 120 seconds after the<br>
extrusion.<br>
Hereinbelow, the method for producing the poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin of the present inven-<br>
tion is described in detail.<br>
The method for producing the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin of the present invention comprises<br>
the following steps (1) and (2):<br>
(1) providing a molten form of a trimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer comprising:<br>
90 to 100 mole % of trimethylene terephthalate re-<br>
curring units, and<br>
0 to 10 mole % of at least one monomer unit se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of monomer units ob-<br>
tained from comonomers which are other than the mono-<br>
mers used for forming the trimethylene terephthalate<br>
recurring units and which are copolymerizable with at<br>
least one of the monomers used for forming the<br>
trimethylene terephthalate recurring units,<br>
the trimethylene terephthalate prepolymer having<br>
an intrinsic viscosity [?] of from 0.2 to 2 dl/g, and<br>
(2) polymerizing the molten form of a trimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer at a temperature which is<br>
equal to or higher than the crystalline melting point<br>
of the prepolymer and is not higher than 290 Â°C under<br>
reduced pressure by the guide-wetting fall process in<br>
which the prepolymer is allowed to fall along and in<br>
contact with the surface of a guide so that polymeriza-<br>
tion of the prepolymer is effected during the fall<br>
thereof.<br>
As mentioned above, a polymerizer which does not<br>
have a rotary driving part has been proposed as a poly-<br>
merizer for producing resins other than a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate. However, the melt<br>
-polycondensation reaction for producing a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate greatly differs from the<br>
melt-polycondensation reactions for producing other<br>
types of polyesters, such as a PET and a PBT, and for<br>
producing polyamides. Therefore, a practical produc-<br>
tion of a polytrimethylene terephthalate cannot be re-<br>
alized simply by employing the polymerizers which have<br>
been used for the production of the other types of<br>
polyesters and for the production of polyamides. The<br>
important differences between the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate, and polyamides and the other types of<br>
polyesters (such as a PET and a PBT) are explained be-<br>
low.<br>
Firstly, both of the melt-polycondensation reac-<br>
tion for producing polyamides and the melt<br>
-polycondensation reaction for producing the other<br>
types of polyesters are equilibrium reactions. However,<br>
the equilibrium constants of the above two reactions<br>
greatly differ from each other. In general, the equi-<br>
librium constants of the melt-polycondensation reac-<br>
tions for producing polyamides are in the order of 10 ,<br>
whereas the equilibrium constants of the melt<br>
-polycondensation reactions for producing the other<br>
types of polyesters is approximately 1. Thus, despite<br>
that both of the reactions for producing polyamides and<br>
the reactions for producing the other types of polyes-<br>
ters are polycondensation reactions, the equilibrium<br>
constants of the reactions for producing the other<br>
types of polyesters are extremely small as compared to<br>
those of the reaction for producing the polyamides.<br>
When an equilibrium constant of a certain reaction is<br>
large, the reaction proceeds even without efficiently<br>
withdrawing a by-product from the reaction system.<br>
Therefore, it is easy to increase the polymerization<br>
degrees of polyamides. With respect to the other types<br>
of polyesters (such as a PET and a PBT), although the<br>
equilibrium constants of the reactions for producing a<br>
PET and a PBT are small, the by-products can be easily<br>
withdrawn from the reaction systems, so that it is also<br>
easy to increase the polymerization degree of each of a<br>
PET and a PBT. The reason for this is as follows. In<br>
the case of a PET, the PET has a satisfactory heat sta-<br>
bility, and hence, a polymerization reaction for pro-<br>
ducing the PET can be performed at a temperature (gen-<br>
erally from 280 to 300 Â°C) which is much higher than<br>
the boiling point (198 Â°C) of ethylene glycol which is<br>
a by-product of the polymerization reaction. By per-<br>
forming the polymerization at such a high temperature,<br>
the vapor pressure of ethylene glycol can be increased<br>
and, hence, the ethylene glycol can be easily withdrawn<br>
from the reaction system. Also in the case of a PBT,<br>
1,4-butanediol, which is a by-product of the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction for producing a PBT, can be easily<br>
withdrawn from the reaction system. The reason for<br>
this has not yet been elucidated, but is considered as<br>
follows. In the polymerization reaction system for<br>
producing a PBT, 1,4-butanediol (which is a by-product<br>
having a high boiling point) is converted into low<br>
boiling point substances, such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
(formed by hydrolysis) and butadiene (formed by heat<br>
decomposition), which low boiling point substances can<br>
be easily withdrawn from the reaction system.<br>
As in the case of the polymerization reactions for<br>
producing the other types of polyesters, the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction for producing a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate has a low equilibrium constant, and hence,<br>
the by-produced trimethylene glycol (TMG) needs to be<br>
efficiently withdrawn from the reaction system so as to<br>
advance the polymerization reaction. The TMG has a<br>
boiling point as high as 214 Â°C. On the other hand,<br>
the polytrimethylene terephthalate is susceptible to<br>
heat decomposition, so that the polymerization reaction<br>
for producing the polytrimethylene terephthalate needs<br>
to be performed at a low temperature. Therefore, it is<br>
difficult to withdraw the TMG from the reaction system.<br>
Further, when the polymerization degree of a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate becomes high, the following<br>
disadvantage is caused. The viscosity of the poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate also becomes high and, hence,<br>
it becomes difficult to withdraw TMG from the reaction<br>
system. In such a case, a heat decomposition of the<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate markedly occurs, so that<br>
the reaction rate is lowered, and then, the polymeriza-<br>
tion degree of the polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
starts to be lowered. If the polymerization reaction<br>
is performed at a high temperature, the withdrawal of<br>
the TMG becomes easier; however, the heat decomposition<br>
of the polytrimethylene terephthalate markedly occurs,<br>
thereby leading to the above-mentioned disadvantage<br>
that, when the polymerization degree of a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate becomes high and the viscos-<br>
ity of the polytrimethylene terephthalate also becomes<br>
high, the reaction rate is lowered, and then, the po-<br>
lymerization degree of the polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late starts to be lowered.<br>
However, as a result of the studies of the present<br>
inventors, it has unexpectedly been found that, when a<br>
molten form of a polytrimethylene terephthalate pre-<br>
polymer having an intrinsic viscosity within the above-<br>
mentioned specific range is polymerized by the above-<br>
mentioned guide-wetting fall process at an appropriate<br>
temperature under reduced pressure, a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate can be produced without causing the prob-<br>
lems accompanying the conventional polymerization meth-<br>
ods for producing the other types of polyesters, such<br>
as a PET, and for producing polyamides, i.e., methods<br>
in which a polymerization is performed by allowing a<br>
prepolymer to fall in the form of fibers or to fall<br>
along and in contact with a guide, such as a wire.<br>
With respect to the guide-wetting fall process,<br>
reference can be made, for example, to U.S. Patent Nos .<br>
5,589,564, 5,840,826, 6,265,526 and 6,320,015.<br>
The features of the method of the present inven-<br>
tion are described below.<br>
Firstly, for obtaining a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin having a high polymerization degree<br>
only by melt polymerization, it is required not only to<br>
suppress the heat decomposition of the PTT, but also to<br>
remove efficiently a TMG (by-product of the reaction<br>
for producing the PTT). In the method of the present<br>
invention, these requirements are satisfied by perform-<br>
ing the polymerization by allowing a prepolymer to fall<br>
along and in contact with the guide at an appropriate<br>
temperature under reduced pressure to thereby increase<br>
the surface area of the prepolymer. Further, by allow-<br>
ing the polymer to fall along and in contact with a<br>
guide, it becomes possible to prevent the disadvanta-<br>
geous fluctuation of qualities of the products, wherein<br>
the fluctuation occurs due to the breakage of the poly-<br>
mer flow in the polymerizer.<br>
Secondly, for preventing the discoloration of the<br>
polymer which is caused by the entrance of oxygen and a<br>
sealing liquid into the polymer, it is required to em-<br>
ploy a polymerizer having no rotary driving part at a<br>
portion of the polymerizer, which portion contains a<br>
gaseous phase during the polymerization. In the guide-<br>
wetting fall process, there is no need for the polymer-<br>
izer to have a rotary driving part in such a gaseous<br>
phase portion of the polymerizer, and the polymerizer<br>
exhibits an excellent sealability under a highly vac-<br>
uumized condition, so that a discoloration caused by<br>
leakage of oxygen into the polymerizer can be almost<br>
completely prevented. Further, since the polymerizer<br>
has no rotary driving part, a mixing of a sealing liq-<br>
uid into a polymer would not occur, and the maintenance<br>
of the polymerizer is easy. Thus, a high quality poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate which is free from a disad-<br>
vantageous discoloration can be obtained.<br>
Thirdly, for stably producing a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin on a commercial scale, it is re-<br>
quired to suppress the foaming of the prepolymer intro-<br>
duced into the polymerization reaction zone, so as to<br>
prevent the staining of the lower surface of the perfo-<br>
rated plate and inner wall of the polymerizer. In the<br>
method of the present invention, this requirement is<br>
satisfied by introducing a prepolymer having an in-<br>
creased viscosity, more specifically by polymerizing a<br>
prepolymer having a high intrinsic viscosity within a<br>
specific range at a specific low temperature. By vir-<br>
tue of this feature, it becomes possible to suppress<br>
the lowering of the quality of the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin, which is caused by the mixing or<br>
entrance of the stain into the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin.<br>
Thus, by the method of the present invention, the<br>
problems accompanying the conventional techniques for<br>
performing a melt-polycondensation to produce a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin can be solved, and it<br>
becomes possible to produce resin which is free from a<br>
discoloration caused by heat decomposition, and which<br>
has high quality and high polymerization degree. Such<br>
effects are unexpected from the conventional techniques<br>
for performing polymerization reactions for producing<br>
polyamides and the other types of polyesters.<br>
In the present invention, it is necessary to in-<br>
troduce a trimethylene terephthalate prepolymer in a<br>
molten form through the holes of the perforated plate<br>
into the polymerization reaction zone at a temperature<br>
which is equal to or higher than the crystalline melt-<br>
ing point of the prepolymer and is not higher than<br>
290 Â°C, wherein the prepolymer has an intrinsic viscos-<br>
ity [r|] of from 0.2 to 2 dl/g.<br>
In the present invention, the "trimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer" means a polycondensation<br>
product which has a molecular weight lower than the fi-<br>
nal polytrimethylene terephthalate resin obtained<br>
therefrom.<br>
In the present invention, it is important to sup-<br>
press the scattering of the prepolymer in the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction zone, which is caused by the vigorous<br>
foaming of the prepolymer. In the present invention,<br>
for suppressing the scattering of the prepolymer, and<br>
for effectively removing the by-produced TMG from the<br>
reaction system, it is essential to introduce the<br>
above-mentioned prepolymer having a specific intrinsic<br>
viscosity [r|] into the polymerization reaction zone at<br>
the above-mentioned specific temperature. When the<br>
scattering of the prepolymer is caused by the vigorous<br>
foaming of the prepolymer introduced through the holes<br>
of the perforated plate into the polymerization reac-<br>
tion zone, the polymer adheres to the lower surface of<br>
the perforated plate and the inner wall of the polymer-<br>
izer, thereby staining them. The prepolymer which ad-<br>
heres to the lower surface of the perforated plate and<br>
the inner wall of the polymerizer remains in the poly-<br>
merizer for a long period of time, and hence, suffers<br>
heat decomposition to form a discolored low molecular<br>
weight product and/or a discolored modified product.<br>
When such discolored products get mixed with the final<br>
48<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate resin, the quality of<br>
the resin is lowered. For suppressing the scattering<br>
of the prepolymer caused by the vigorous foaming<br>
thereof, it is necessary that the prepolymer has an in-<br>
trinsic viscosity [?] of 0.2 or more. Further, for<br>
constantly producing a resin having a narrow molecular<br>
weight distribution, it is preferred that the prepoly-<br>
mer has a high viscosity. The reason for this is as<br>
follows. In the guide-wetting fall process employed in<br>
the present invention, a fluctuation of polymerization<br>
degree of the prepolymer being polymerized may occur<br>
due to the fluctuation of the falling rate of the pre-<br>
polymer and the fluctuation of the level of surface re-<br>
newal of the prepolymer, leading to a broad molecular<br>
weight distribution of the final resin. For preventing<br>
such fluctuation of the falling rate of the prepolymer<br>
and fluctuation of the level of surface renewal of the<br>
prepolymer, it is preferred that the viscosity of the<br>
prepolymer is high.<br>
However, on the other hand, when the prepolymer<br>
has too high an intrinsic viscosity, it becomes diffi-<br>
cult to withdraw efficiently the by-produced TMG from<br>
the reaction system. Further, when the intrinsic vis-<br>
cosity is too high, the amount of the by-produced TMG<br>
becomes extremely small, so that it becomes difficult<br>
to cause an appropriately mild foaming of the prepoly-<br>
mer during the fall thereof in the polymerizer, which<br>
foaming of the prepolymer is an important feature of<br>
the polymerization method of the present invention.<br>
Thus, it becomes difficult to improve the polymeriza-<br>
tion degree of the polytrimethylene terephthalate resin.<br>
For preventing the above disadvantages, it is nec-<br>
essary that the prepolymer has an intrinsic viscosity<br>
[?] of 2 dl/g or less. It is preferred that the pre-<br>
polymer has an intrinsic viscosity [?] of from 0.3 to<br>
1.8 dl/g, more advantageously from 0.4 to 1.5 dl/g.<br>
In addition, for preventing disadvantages (e.g.,<br>
vigorous foaming of the prepolymer, and heat decomposi-<br>
tion of the prepolymer) which are caused by the low<br>
viscosity of the prepolymer and which lead to a lower-<br>
ing of the quality of the polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late resin, it is necessary that the temperature of the<br>
prepolymer introduced into the polymerization reaction<br>
zone be 290 Â°C or less. On the other hand, for uni-<br>
formly introducing the prepolymer into the polymeriza-<br>
tion reaction zone without solidifying the prepolymer<br>
in the holes of the perforated plate, and for causing<br>
the prepolymer as a whole to fall uniformly along and<br>
in contact with the guide without partially solidifying<br>
the prepolymer during the fall thereof, it is necessary<br>
that the temperature of the prepolymer introduced into<br>
the polymerization reaction zone be equal to or higher<br>
than the crystalline melting point of the prepolymer.<br>
In the present invention, the crystalline melting<br>
point of the prepolymer means a temperature at which an<br>
endothermic peak ascribed to the melting of a crystal<br>
is observed in a differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC) chart of the prepolymer, wherein the DSC chart is<br>
obtained by means of an input compensation-type differ-<br>
ential scanning calorimeter (trade name: Pyris 1; manu-<br>
factured and sold by Perkin Elmer, Inc., U.S.A.) under<br>
the following conditions:<br>
Measuring temperature: 0 to 280 Â°C, and<br>
Rate of temperature elevation: 10 "C/min.<br>
The temperature of the prepolymer introduced into<br>
the polymerization reaction zone is preferably 5 Â° C or<br>
more higher than the crystalline melting point of the<br>
prepolymer and not higher than 280 Â°C, more preferably<br>
10 Â° C or more higher than the crystalline melting point<br>
of the prepolymer but not higher than 27 5 Â° C, still<br>
more preferably 15 oC or more higher than the crystal-<br>
line melting point of the prepolymer but not higher<br>
than 26 5 Â°C.<br>
In the present invention, the above-mentioned per-<br>
forated plate is a plate having a plurality of<br>
through-holes through which the prepolymer is intro-<br>
duced into the polymerization reaction zone. There is<br>
no particular limitation with respect to the thickness<br>
of the perforated plate. However, the thickness of the<br>
perforated plate is generally in the range of from 0.1<br>
to 300 mm, preferably from 1 to 200 mm, more preferably<br>
from 5 to 150 mm. The perforated plate needs to have a<br>
strength sufficient to sustain the pressure inside the<br>
chamber of the polymerizer, into which the molten pre-<br>
polymer is fed. Also, when the guide(s) in the polym-<br>
erization reaction zone of the polymerizer is (are)<br>
hung from the perforated plate, it is necessary that<br>
the perforated plate can sustain the weight of the<br>
guide(s) and the molten prepolymer which is falling<br>
along and in contact with the surface of the guide(s).<br>
For this reason, it is preferred that the perforated<br>
plate is reinforced with a rib. The shape of the hole<br>
of the perforated plate is generally selected from a<br>
circle, an ellipse, a triangle, a slit, a polygon, a<br>
star and the like. The area at the opening of each<br>
hole is generally in the range of from 0.01 to 100 cm2,<br>
preferably from 0.05 to 10 cm , more preferably from<br>
0.1 to 5 cm . Further, nozzles or the like may be at-<br>
tached to the holes of the perforated plate. The dis-<br>
tance between mutually adjacent holes of the perforated<br>
plate is generally from 1 to 500 mm, preferably from 25<br>
to 100 mm, as measured between the respective centers<br>
of the mutually adjacent holes. The perforated plate<br>
may have tubes attached thereto, such that the hollow<br>
portions of the tubes serve as the holes of the perfo-<br>
rated plate. Further, the hole of the perforated plate<br>
may have a tapered configuration. It is preferred that<br>
the size and shape of the hole are determined so that<br>
the pressure loss which occurs when the molten form of<br>
a prepolymer passes through the perforated plate is<br>
from 0.01 to 5 MPa, more preferably from 0.1 to 5 MPa.<br>
When the pressure loss is in the above-mentioned range,<br>
it becomes easy to obtain a resin having a further im-<br>
proved polymerization degree (the reason for this is<br>
not clear). In general, it is preferred that the mate-<br>
rial used for the perforated plate is selected from the<br>
group consisiting of metallic materials, such as<br>
stainless steel, carbon steel, Hastelloy, nickel, tita-<br>
nium, chromium and alloys other than mentioned.<br>
Further, it is preferred that a filter is provided<br>
in the flowing path of the prepolymer in the polymer-<br>
izer at a point which is upstream of the perforated<br>
plate. The reason for this is that the filter can be<br>
used for removing an impurity, if any, which is con-<br>
tained in the prepolymer, and which may cause the clog-<br>
ging of the holes of the perforated plate. The type of<br>
filter is appropriately selected so that the impurity<br>
having a size larger than the diameter of the holes of<br>
the perforated plate can be removed, and that the fil-<br>
ter is not destroyed by the passage of the prepolymer<br>
therethrough.<br>
Examples of methods for causing the molten pre-<br>
polymer to pass downwardly through a perforated plate<br>
provided in the polymerizer and fall along and in con-<br>
tact with the guide include a method in which the pre-<br>
polymer is allowed to fall only by liquid head or by<br>
gravity, and a method in which the prepolymer on the<br>
perforated plate is pressurized by using a pump or the<br>
like to thereby force the molten prepolymer to pass<br>
downwardly through a perforated plate. It is preferred<br>
that the fluctuation of the amount of falling prepoly-<br>
mer is suppressed by means of a pump which has a meas-<br>
uring ability, such as a gear pump.<br>
There is no particular limitation with respect to<br>
the number of holes of the perforated plate. The ap-<br>
propriate number of holes of the perforated plate var-<br>
ies depending on the polymerization conditions (such as<br>
a polymerization temperature and a polymerization pres-<br>
sure), the amount of the catalyst used, the range of<br>
the molecular weight of the prepolymer, and the like.<br>
For example, when it is intended to produce the resin<br>
at a rate of 100 kg/hr, it is preferred that the perfo-<br>
rated plate has 1 to 104 holes, more advantageously 2<br>
to 102 holes.<br>
In the present invention, it is necessary that the<br>
prepolymer which has been introduced through the holes<br>
of the perforated plate into the polymerization reac-<br>
tion zone is polymerized by allowing the prepolymer to<br>
fall along and in contact with the guide in the polym-<br>
erization reaction zone under reduced pressure. It is<br>
preferred that the prepolymer in the polymerization re-<br>
action zone is in a foaming state such that the bubbles<br>
formed in the prepolymer in the polymerization reaction<br>
zone would not be broken instantaneously. It is espe-<br>
cially preferred that the prepolymer at a lower portion<br>
of the guide is in a foaming state. Needless to say,<br>
it is most preferred that the whole of the prepolymer<br>
in the polymerization reaction zone is in a foaming<br>
state.<br>
The guide used in the method of the present inven-<br>
tion may be any of a wire, a chain, a wire mesh (each<br>
of the chain and the wire mesh is made by combining<br>
wires), a jungle gym-like body (having a lattice struc-<br>
ture composed of wires), a flat or curved thin plate, a<br>
perforated plate, and a filler column (which is formed<br>
by regularly or irregularly piling fillers together).<br>
For efficiently withdrawing TMG from the reaction<br>
system, it is preferred that the surface area of the<br>
falling prepolymer is increased. Therefore, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the guide is a wire, a chain, a wire mesh<br>
or a jungle gym-like body. Further, for more effi-<br>
ciently withdrawing TMG from the reaction system to<br>
further improve the polymerization rate, it is espe-<br>
cially preferred not only to increase the surface area<br>
of the guide, but also to form concave portion(s)<br>
and/or convex portion(s) on the surface of the guide<br>
which are arranged along the length thereof, so as to<br>
promote the agitation and surface renewal of the pre-<br>
polymer falling along and in contact with the surface<br>
of the guide. Thus, it is preferred that the guide has<br>
at least one portion selected from the group consisting<br>
of a concave portion, a convex portion and a perforated<br>
portion. Specifically, it is preferred to use a guide<br>
having a structure which hampers the fall of the poly-<br>
mer, such as a chain, a jungle gym-like body or a wire<br>
having concavo-convex portions on the surface thereof<br>
along which the prepolymer falls. Needless to say, the<br>
above-mentioned guides can be used in combination.<br>
In the present specification, the term "wire"<br>
means a body in which the ratio of the length of the<br>
body to the average perimeter of the cross-section of<br>
the body is very large. There is no particular limita-<br>
tion with respect to the cross-sectional area of the<br>
wire. However, in general, the cross-sectional area is<br>
in the range of from 10-3 to 102 cm2 , preferably from<br>
10-2 to 10 cm2, more preferably from 10"1 to 1 cm2.<br>
There is no particular limitation with respect to the<br>
shape of the cross-section of the guide, and the shape<br>
is generally selected from a circle, an ellipse, a tri-<br>
angle, a quadrangle, a polygon, a star and the like.<br>
The shape of the cross-section of the wire may be uni-<br>
form or may vary along the length of the wire. The<br>
wire may be hollow. Further, the wire may be made of a<br>
single strand, or made of a plurality of strands,<br>
wherein, for example, the strands are twisted together.<br>
The surface of the wire may be smooth or may have con-<br>
cavo-convex portions as mentioned above, a locally pro-<br>
truding portion or the like. There is no particular<br>
limitation with respect to the material used for the<br>
wire, but the material is generally selected from the<br>
group consisting of, for example, stainless steel, car-<br>
bon steel, Hastelloy, nickel, titanium, chromium and<br>
other alloys. If desired, the wire may be subjected to<br>
surface treatment. Examples of surface treatments in-<br>
elude plating, lining, passivation, and washing with an<br>
acid.<br>
The "wire mesh" means a body which is made by com-<br>
bining the above-mentioned wires so as to form a lat-<br>
tice. The wires can be linear or curved, and the angle<br>
between the combined wires can be appropriately se-<br>
lected. With respect to the area ratio of the wires of<br>
the wire mesh to the open spaces (which ratio is meas-<br>
ured with respect to the projected image of the wire<br>
mesh), there is no particular limitation, but the area<br>
ratio is generally in the range of from 1/0.5 to<br>
1/1,000, preferably from 1/1 to 1/500, more preferably<br>
from 1/5 to 1/100. It is preferred that the area ratio<br>
of the wire mesh does not vary horizontally relative to<br>
the vertical direction of the wire mesh. Further, it<br>
is preferred that the area ratio of the wire mesh along<br>
the vertical length of the wire mesh does not vary or<br>
varies such that, when the wire mesh is provided as the<br>
guide in the polymerizer, the area of each open space<br>
at a lower portion of the wire mesh becomes smaller<br>
than that at an upper portion of the wire mesh (which<br>
means that the area ratio at a lower portion of the<br>
wire mesh becomes larger than that at an upper portion<br>
of the wire mesh).<br>
In the present invention, the "chain" means a body<br>
in which rings formed by the above-mentioned wires are<br>
linked together. The shape of rings can be a circle,<br>
an ellipse, a rectangle, a square or the like. The<br>
rings can be linked in one dimension, two dimensions or<br>
three dimensions.<br>
In the present invention, the term "jungle gym<br>
-like body" means a material in which the above<br>
-mentioned wires are three-dimensionally combined with<br>
one another so as to form a lattice. The wires used<br>
can be linear or curved, and the angle between the com-<br>
bined wires can be appropriately selected.<br>
Examples of wires having convex portion(s) and/or<br>
concave portion(s) on the surface thereof (along and in<br>
contact with which the prepolymer is allowed to fall)<br>
include a wire to which a rod having a circular or po-<br>
lygonal cross-section is attached such that the rod ex-<br>
tends substantially vertically of the wire, and a wire<br>
to which a disc-shaped or cylindrical-shaped body is<br>
attached such that the wire penetrates through the<br>
disc-shaped or cylindrical-shaped body around the cen-<br>
ter thereof. It is preferred that the convex portion<br>
has a height which is at least 5 mm larger than the<br>
diameter of the wire. As a specific example of wires<br>
having convex portion(s), there can be mentioned a wire<br>
to which a plurality of discs are attached at intervals<br>
of from 1 to 500 mm, in which each disc has a diameter<br>
which is at least 5 mm larger than the diameter of the<br>
wire and not more than 100 mm, and a thickness of from<br>
approximately 1 to 10 mm.<br>
With respect to the chain, jungle gym-like body<br>
and wire having concavo-convex portions on the surface<br>
thereof, which are used as the guides, there is no par-<br>
ticular limitation on the volume ratio of the skeleton<br>
of the guide (e.g., wires used to form the guide) to<br>
the open spaces in the guide. However, in general, the<br>
volume ratio is in the range of from 1/0.5 to 1/10 ,<br>
preferably from 1/10 to 1/10 , more preferably from<br>
1/102 to 1/105. It is preferred that the volume ratio<br>
does not vary horizontally of the downwardly extending<br>
guide. Further, it is preferred that the volume ratio<br>
of the downwardly extending guide along the length of<br>
the guide does not vary or varies such that, when the<br>
guide is provided in the polymerizer, the volume ratio<br>
at a lower portion of the guide becomes larger than<br>
that at an upper portion of the guide.<br>
The above-mentioned guides can be used individu-<br>
ally or in combination, depending on the configuration<br>
of the guides. When the guide is a wire or a linear<br>
chain, the number of guide(s) used is generally in the<br>
range of from 1 to 100,000, preferably from 3 to 50,000.<br>
When the guide is a wire mesh, a chain formed by two-<br>
diraensionally combining the wires, a thin plate or a<br>
perforated plate, the number of guide(s) used is gener-<br>
ally in the range of from 1 to 1,000, preferably from 2<br>
to 100. When the guide is a chain formed by three-<br>
dimensionally combining the wires, a jungle gym-like<br>
body or a filler column, the number of the guide(s) can<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the sizes of the<br>
polymerizer and the polymerization reaction zone where<br>
the guide(s) is (are) provided.<br>
When a plurality of guides are used, it is pre-<br>
ferred to arrange the guides so as for the guides not<br>
to contact with each other by using a spacer or the<br>
like.<br>
In the present invention, in general, the prepoly-<br>
mer is introduced through at least one hole of the per-<br>
forated plate into the polymerization reaction zone<br>
where the prepolymer is allowed to fall along and in<br>
contact with the guide. The number of holes of the<br>
perforated plate can be appropriately selected depend-<br>
ing on the shape of the guide. In the method of the<br>
present invention, the prepolymer which has passed<br>
through a single hole of the perforated plate can be<br>
allowed to fall along and in contact with a plurality<br>
of guides. However, for causing the prepolymer to fall<br>
uniformly so as to obtain a resin having a narrow mo-<br>
lecular weight distribution constantly, it is preferred<br>
that the number of guide(s) along which the prepolymer<br>
(which has passed through a single hole of the perfo-<br>
rated plate) is allowed to fall is small. For example,<br>
when the guide is a wire, it is preferred that the num-<br>
ber of guide(s) along which the prepolymer (which has<br>
passed through a single hole of the perforated plate)<br>
is allowed to fall is 3 or less. There is no particu-<br>
lar limitation with respect to the position of the<br>
guide(s) in the polymerizer so long as the prepolymer<br>
can fall along and in contact with the guide(s), and<br>
the guide(s) can be provided such that the guide passes<br>
through the hole of the perforated plate or is hung be-<br>
low the hole of the perforated plate.<br>
With respect to the distance over which the molten<br>
prepolymer (having passed through the holes of the per-<br>
forated plate) falls along and in contact with the sur-<br>
face of the guide, the distance is preferably from 0.3<br>
to 50 m, more preferably from 0.5 to 20 m, still more<br>
preferably from 1 to 10 m.<br>
The flow rate of prepolymer passing through the<br>
holes of the perforated plate is preferably in the<br>
range of from 10+2 to 10 liters/hr per hole of the<br>
perforated plate, more preferably from 0.1 to 50 li-<br>
ters/hr per hole of the perforated plate. When the<br>
flow rate of prepolymer is within the above-mentioned<br>
range, it becomes possible to prevent a marked lowering<br>
of the polymerization rate and the productivity of the<br>
final resin.<br>
In the method of the present invention, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the average falling time of the prepolymer<br>
is in the range of from 10 seconds to 100 hours, more<br>
preferably from 1 minute to 10 hours, still more pref-<br>
erably from 5 minutes to 5 hours, most preferably from<br>
20 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
In the method of the present invention, as men-<br>
tioned above, it is necessary that the polymerization<br>
reaction (performed by allowing the prepolymer to fall<br>
along and in contact with the guide) be performed under<br>
reduced pressure. By performing the polymerization re-<br>
action under reduced pressure, TMG (which is by-<br>
produced during the polymerization reaction) is effi-<br>
ciently withdrawn from the reaction system so as to ad-<br>
vance the polymerization reaction. The reduced pres-<br>
sure means a pressure which is lower than the atmos-<br>
pheric pressure. Generally, it is preferred that the<br>
polymerization is conducted under a pressure of 100,000<br>
Pa or less, more preferably 10,000 Pa or less, still<br>
more preferably 1,000 Pa or less, most preferably 100<br>
Pa or less. There is no particular limitation with re-<br>
spect to the lower limit of the pressure under which<br>
the polymerization is conducted. However, from the<br>
viewpoint of the size of the equipment for reducing the<br>
pressure in the reaction system, it is preferred that<br>
the pressure is 0.1 Pa or more.<br>
Further, an inert gas which does not adversely af-<br>
fect the polymerization reaction can be introduced into<br>
the reaction system under reduced pressure, so as to<br>
remove the by-produced TMG in such a form as entrained<br>
by the inert gas . In the method of the present inven-<br>
tion, the inert gas is generally used in an amount of<br>
from 0.005 to 100 mg per gram of the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin withdrawn from the polymerization<br>
reaction zone.<br>
Conventionally, it has been understood that the<br>
introduction of inert gas into a polycondensation reac-<br>
tion system lowers the partial pressure of a by-product<br>
formed during the polycondensation reaction, thereby<br>
displacing the equilibrium of the reaction in the di-<br>
rection of the desired product formation. However, in<br>
the present invention, the inert gas is introduced into<br>
the reaction zone only in a very small amount, and<br>
hence, the improvement of the polymerization rate by<br>
the lowering of partial pressure of a by-product cannot<br>
be expected. Thus, from the conventional understanding,<br>
the function of the inert gas used in the method of the<br>
present invention cannot be explained. From the stud-<br>
ies of the present inventors, it has surprisingly been<br>
found that the introduction of inert gas into the po-<br>
lymerization reaction zone causes an appropriately mild<br>
foaming of the molten prepolymer on the guide, so that<br>
not only is the surface area of the molten prepolymer<br>
greatly increased, but also the surface renewal of the<br>
prepolymer vigorously occurs without staining the inner<br>
wall of the polymerizer. It is presumed that a vigor-<br>
ous movement of the prepolymer at various portions (in-<br>
cluding inner and surface portions) thereof causes the<br>
remarkable improvement in the polymerization rate.<br>
As the inert gas introduced into the polymeriza-<br>
tion reaction zone, it is preferred to use inert gas<br>
which does not cause discoloration, denaturation or de-<br>
composition of the polymer. Preferred examples of in-<br>
ert gases include nitrogen gas, argon gas, helium gas,<br>
carbon dioxide gas and a lower hydrocarbon gas. Need-<br>
less to say, a mixture of the above mentioned gases can<br>
also be used in the present invention. As the inert<br>
gas, it is more preferred to use nitrogen gas, argon<br>
gas, helium gas and/or carbon dioxide gas. Among these<br>
gases, nitrogen gas is most preferred from the view-<br>
point of availability.<br>
In the present invention, the amount of inert gas<br>
introduced into the polymerization reaction zone may be<br>
very small. Specifically, it is preferred that the<br>
amount of inert gas is in the range of from 0.05 to 100<br>
mg per gram of the final resin withdrawn from the po-<br>
lymerization reaction zone. By using the inert gas in<br>
an amount of 0.05 mg or more per gram of the final res-<br>
in withdrawn from the polymerization reaction zone, it<br>
becomes possible to foam the polymer satisfactorily so<br>
as to increase the polymerization degree. On the other<br>
hand, by using the inert gas in an amount of 100 mg or<br>
less, it becomes easy to maintain the appropriate<br>
reduced pressure in the polymerization reaction zone.<br>
It is preferred that the amount of inert gas introduced<br>
into the polymerization reaction zone is in the range<br>
of from 0.1 to 50 mg per gram of the final resin with-<br>
drawn from the polymerization reaction zone, more ad-<br>
vantageously from 0.2 to 10 mg.<br>
Examples of methods for introducing the inert gas<br>
into the polymerization reaction zone include a method<br>
in which at least a part of the inert gas is introduced<br>
to the polymerization reaction zone, independently from<br>
the feeding of the trimethylene terephthalate prepoly-<br>
mer to the polymerization reaction zone, and a method<br>
in which at least a part of the inert gas is introduced<br>
to the polymerization reaction zone in such a form as<br>
absorbed and/or contained in the trimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer, such that the inert gas is<br>
caused to be discharged from the prepolymer under re-<br>
duced pressure in the polymerization reaction zone.<br>
These two methods can be used individually or in combi-<br>
nation .<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to em-<br>
ploy the above-mentioned method in which at least a<br>
part of the inert gas is introduced to the polymeriza-<br>
tion reaction zone in such a form as absorbed by the<br>
trimethylene terephthalate prepolymer or in such a form<br>
as contained in the trimethylene terephthalate prepoly-<br>
mer. The former means that the inert gas is dissolved<br>
in the prepolymer, and is not present in the form of<br>
bubbles in the prepolymer. On the other hand, the lat-<br>
ter means that the inert gas is present in the form of<br>
bubbles in the prepolymer. When the inert gas is pre-<br>
sent in the form of bubbles in the prepolymer, it is<br>
preferred that the size of each bubble is as small as<br>
possible. It is preferred that the average diameter of<br>
each bubble is 5 mm or less, more advantageously 2 mm<br>
or less.<br>
When the inert gas is introduced to the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction zone, independently from the feeding of<br>
the prepolymer to the polymerization reaction zone, it<br>
is preferred to feed the inert gas to the polymerizer<br>
at a position remote from the perforated plate and<br>
close to the outlet for withdrawing the final resin.<br>
Further, it is preferred to feed the inert gas to the<br>
polymerizer at a position remote from the vent to which<br>
a vacuum gas discharge line is connected.<br>
On the other hand, examples of methods for causing<br>
the inert gas to be absorbed by and/or contained in the<br>
prepolymer include a method using any of conventional<br>
absorption devices, such as a packed column type ab-<br>
sorption device, a tray-containing column type absorp-<br>
tion device, a spraying device-containing column type<br>
absorption device (in which a liquid is sprayed in a<br>
gas to be absorbed in the liquid), a turbulent contact<br>
absorption device, a gas-liquid film cross-contacting<br>
type absorption device, a high-speed rotary flow type<br>
absorption device, an absorption device utilizing me-<br>
chanical force, which are described in "Kagaku Souchi<br>
Sekkei"Sousa Shiriizu No. 2, Kaitei Gasu Kyushu (Design<br>
and Operation of Chemical Devices, No. 2, Gas Absorp-<br>
tion (Revised Version))", pp. 49-54 (published on March<br>
15, 1981 by Kagaku Kogyosha, Inc., Japan); and a method<br>
in which the inert gas is injected into the prepolymer<br>
in a conduit for transferring the prepolymer to the po-<br>
lymerizer. Most preferred is a method using a device<br>
in which the prepolymer is allowed to fall along and in<br>
contact with the surface of a guide in an atmosphere of<br>
inert gas to thereby cause the prepolymer to absorb the<br>
inert gas during the fall thereof. In this method, in-<br>
ert gas having a pressure higher than the pressure in-<br>
side the polymerizer is introduced into the gas absorp-<br>
tion device. The pressure of the inert gas introduced<br>
into the gas absorption device is preferably from 0.01<br>
to 1 MPa, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.5 MPa, still<br>
more preferably from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa.<br>
In both of the above-mentioned methods for intro-<br>
ducing the inert gas into the polymerization reaction<br>
system, it is preferred that at least a part of the<br>
prepolymer falling in the polymerization reaction zone<br>
is in a foaming state. It is especially preferred that<br>
the prepolymer at a lower portion of the polymerization<br>
reaction zone is a forming state. Needless to say, it<br>
is most preferred that the whole of the prepolymer fal-<br>
ling in the polymerization reaction zone is in a foam-<br>
ing state. In the present invention, the "foaming<br>
state" encompasses both a state in which the formed<br>
bubbles are immediately broken and a state in which the<br>
formed bubbles are maintained for a relatively long<br>
time.<br>
In the method of the present invention, it is nec-<br>
essary that the temperature in the polymerization reac-<br>
tion zone is equal to or higher than the crystalline<br>
melting point of the prepolymer, and not higher than<br>
290 Â°C. By performing the polymerization reaction at a<br>
temperature which is equal to or higher than the crys-<br>
talline melting point of the prepolymer, it becomes<br>
easy to cause the prepolymer to fall stably without<br>
causing the prepolymer to get too viscose or solidified.<br>
Further, by performing the polymerization reaction at a<br>
temperature which is not higher than 290 Â°C, a discol-<br>
oration of the prepolymer caused by heat decomposition<br>
of the prepolymer is suppressed, and hence, a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin having high quality<br>
can be easily obtained. It is preferred that the dif-<br>
ference between the temperature in the polymerization<br>
reaction zone (which is within the above-mentioned<br>
range) and the temperature of the molten prepolymer in-<br>
troduced into the polymerization reaction zone through<br>
the perforated plate is 20 Â°C or less, more advanta-<br>
geously 10 Â°C or less, still more advantageously 5 Â°C<br>
or less, and it is most preferred that the temperature<br>
in the polymerization reaction zone and the temperature<br>
of the molten prepolymer introduced into the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction zone are the same. The temperature in<br>
the polymerization reaction zone can be controlled by<br>
adjusting the temperature of a heater or a jacket which<br>
is provided on the inner wall of the polymerizer, or by<br>
adjusting the temperature of a heater or a heating me-<br>
dium which is provided inside the guide.<br>
In the present invention, for improving the polym-<br>
erization rate, it is preferred that the prepolymer<br>
contains a polycondensation catalyst.<br>
Examples of polycondensation catalysts include ti-<br>
tanium alkoxides, such as titanium tetrabutoxide and<br>
titanium tetraisopropoxide; titanium compounds, such as<br>
titanium dioxide and a double salt of titanium dioxide<br>
and silicon dioxide; antimony compounds, such as dian-<br>
timony trioxide and antimony acetate; and tin compounds,<br>
such as butyl stannate, butyltin tris(2-ethylhexoate)<br>
and tin 2-ethylhexanoate. Of these, titanium tetrabu-<br>
toxide and tin 2-ethylhexanoate are especially pre-<br>
ferred from the viewpoint of improvement in the polym-<br>
erization reaction rate and the color of the final<br>
resin. These catalysts can be used individually or in<br>
combination. It is preferred that the polycondensation<br>
catalyst is contained in the prepolymer in an amount of<br>
from 0.001 to 1 % by weight, more advantageously from<br>
0.005 to 0.5 % by weight, still more advantageously<br>
from 0.01 to 0.2 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the prepolymer.<br>
In the present invention, for obtaining a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin having a very high mo-<br>
lecular weight, it is preferred that the polymerization<br>
degree of the prepolymer is increased, and that the<br>
terminal carboxyl group ratio of the prepolymer is low-<br>
ered, wherein the terminal carboxyl group ratio is a<br>
molar ratio (%) of the terminal carboxyl groups at the<br>
terminals of the prepolymer to the total of terminal<br>
groups of the prepolymer. It is preferred that the<br>
prepolymer has an intrinsic viscosity [?] of 0.5 or<br>
more. By using a prepolymer having such a high intrin-<br>
sic viscosity, it becomes possible to obtain a desir-<br>
able falling rate of the prepolymer and a desirable<br>
foaming state of the prepolymer, thereby greatly im-<br>
proving the polymerization rate. It is preferred that<br>
the prepolymer has an intrinsic viscosity [r|] of 0.55<br>
or more, more preferably 0.60 dl/g or more.<br>
On the other hand, it is preferred that the pre-<br>
polymer has a terminal carboxyl group ratio of 50 % or<br>
less. The terminal carboxyl group ratio is calculated<br>
by the following formula:<br>
Terminal carboxyl group ratio (%)<br>
= (terminal carboxyl group content)/(total terminal<br>
group content) x 100<br>
wherein:<br>
the terminal carboxyl group content is the molar<br>
amount of carboxyl group per kg of a sample, and<br>
the total terminal group content is the total mo-<br>
lar amount of terminal groups per kg of a sample.<br>
When the terminal carboxyl group ratio is 50 % or<br>
less, the polymerization reaction rate can be improved,<br>
so that a resin having a high molecular weight can be<br>
obtained and that a discoloration of the resin can be<br>
suppressed. The terminal carboxyl group ratio is more<br>
preferably 30 % or less, still more preferably 20 % or<br>
less, most preferably 0 %.<br>
The above-mentioned prepolymer which is suitable<br>
for producing a resin having a high molecular weight<br>
has a high intrinsic viscosity. Therefore, when such a<br>
prepolymer is used, it becomes difficult not only to<br>
withdraw TMG from the reaction system due to the high<br>
viscosity of the prepolymer, but also to produce the<br>
prepolymer by means of a conventional vertical agita-<br>
tion type polymerizer. In addition, for decreasing the<br>
terminal carboxyl group ratio of the prepolymer, it is<br>
necessary to improve the polymerization rate and sup-<br>
press heat decomposition. Therefore, it is preferred<br>
that the prepolymer is produced by means of a horizon-<br>
tal agitation type polymerizer equipped with one or two<br>
stirrers, each having a large surface area and a high<br>
surface renewal efficiency.<br>
The method of the present invention can be prac-<br>
ticed in either a manner in which the prepolymer in a<br>
molten form is continuously fed into the polymerizer<br>
and introduced into the polymerization reaction zone<br>
through the holes of the perforated plate, and the pre-<br>
polymer in a molten form is allowed to fall along and<br>
in contact with the guide to thereby perform a polym-<br>
erization, and all of the resultant resin is withdrawn<br>
form the polymerizer; or a manner in which a part of<br>
the resin (obtained by the above-mentioned polymeriza-<br>
tion performed by allowing the prepolymer to fall along<br>
and in contact with the guide) is recycled to the poly-<br>
merizer and subjected to further polymerization. How-<br>
ever, it is preferred to employ the former (in which,<br>
all of the obtained resin is withdrawn from the poly-<br>
merizer). When the method of the present invention is<br>
practiced in the above-mentioned manner in which a part<br>
of the obtained resin is recycled to the polymerizer<br>
and subjected to further polymerization, for suppress-<br>
ing the heat decomposition of the resin which occurs at<br>
a reservoir portion of the polymerizer (i.e., a bottom<br>
portion of the polymerizer where the resin obtained by<br>
the polymerization is accumulated.) and a conduit for<br>
recycling of the resin, it is preferred to reduce the<br>
retention times and lower the temperatures at the<br>
above-mentioned reservoir portion and conduit.<br>
Hereinbelow, the method for producing a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate prepolymer which is used in<br>
the present invention is described in detail.<br>
As representative examples of preferred methods<br>
for producing the polytrimethylene terephthalate pre-<br>
polymer on a commercial scale, there are the following<br>
two methods which differ in the materials used. In one<br>
of the methods, a lower alcohol diester of terephthalic<br>
acid and TMG are subjected to transesterification reac-<br>
tion to obtain bis(3-hydroxylpropyl)terephthalate<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "BHPT") which is an inter-<br>
mediate of a PTT, and the obtained BHPT is subjected to<br>
a polycondensation reaction, thereby obtaining a PTT<br>
prepolymer (hereinafter, this method is referred to as<br>
a "transesterification method"). In the other method,<br>
terephthalic acid and TMG are subjected to an esterifi-<br>
cation reaction to obtain BHPT, and the obtained BHPT<br>
is subjected to a polycondensation reaction as in the<br>
above-mentioned transesterification method, thereby ob-<br>
taining a PTT prepolymer (hereinafter, this method is<br>
referred to as "direct esterification method").<br>
Further, the production of the polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer can be performed in either a<br>
batchwise manner in which all of the raw materials are<br>
charged into the polymerizer at once and reacted to-<br>
gether simultaneously to obtain a PTT prepolymer, or a<br>
continuous manner in which the raw materials are con-<br>
tinuously fed into the polymerizer to continuously ob-<br>
tain a PTT prepolymer. In the present invention, it is<br>
preferred that the production of the PTT prepolymer is<br>
performed in a continuous manner, and that the resul-<br>
tant prepolymer is continuously polymerized by the<br>
method of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, the above-mentioned BHPT<br>
may contain unreacted raw materials (such as<br>
terephthalic acid, a lower alcohol diester of<br>
terephthalic acid and TMG) and a PTT oligomer. However,<br>
it is preferred that the BHPT comprises 70 % by weight<br>
or more of the BHPT and/or a low molecular weight PTT<br>
oligomer, based on the total weight of the BHPT, and<br>
the above-mentioned unreacted raw materials and PTT<br>
oligomer.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanations are made on some exam-<br>
ples of the methods for obtaining the BHPT.<br>
First, an explanation is made on the "transesteri-<br>
fication method". In the transesterification method,<br>
the BHPT is produced by subjecting dimethyl terephtha-<br>
late (hereinafter, referred to as "DMT") (which is a<br>
lower alcohol diester of terephthalic acid) and TMG to<br>
a transesterification reaction at 150 to 240 Â° C in the<br>
presence of a transesterification catalyst. In the<br>
transesterification reaction, the DMT used as a raw ma-<br>
terial exhibits a high volatility, so that it is pre-<br>
ferred to use two or more reactors in combination, and<br>
to control the reaction temperature appropriately.<br>
It is preferred that the lower alcohol diester of<br>
terephthalic acid and the TMG are charged into the re-<br>
actor in a molar ratio (a lower alcohol diester of<br>
terephthalic acid/TMG molar ratio) of from 1/1.3 to 1/4,<br>
more advantageously from 1/1.5 to 1/2.5. When the<br>
amount of TMG is too small so that the above-mentioned<br>
ratio is larger than 1/1.3, the reaction time is likely<br>
to become disadvantageously long. Also when the amount<br>
of TMG is too large so that the above-mentioned ratio<br>
is smaller than 1/4, the reaction time is likely to be-<br>
come disadvantageously long, because it becomes neces-<br>
sary to volatilize the excess TMG.<br>
In the transesterification method, it is necessary<br>
to use a transesterification catalyst. Preferred exam-<br>
ples of transesterification catalysts include titanium<br>
alkoxid.es, such as titanium tetrabutoxide and titanium<br>
tetraisopropoxide; tin compounds, such as tin 2-<br>
ethylhexanoate; cobalt acetate; calcium acetate; and<br>
zinc acetate. Among these catalysts, titanium tetrabu-<br>
toxide and tin 2-ethylhexanoate are preferred because<br>
they function also as catalysts in the subsequent poly-<br>
condensation reaction to produce the final resin. The<br>
amount of transesterification catalyst is preferably in<br>
the range of from 0.02 to 1 % by weight, more prefera-<br>
bly from 0.05 to 0.5 % by weight, still more preferably<br>
from 0.08 to 0.2 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the diester of terephthalic acid.<br>
Next, an explanation is made on the "direct es-<br>
terification method". In the direct esterification<br>
method, the BHPT is produced by subjecting terephthalic<br>
acid and TMG to esterification reaction at 150 to<br>
240 Â° C.<br>
It is preferred that the terephthalic acid and the<br>
TMG are charged into a reactor in a molar ratio<br>
(terephthalic acid/TMG molar ratio) of from 1/1.05 to<br>
1/3, more preferably from 1/1.1 to 1/2. When the<br>
amount of TMG is too small so that the above-mentioned<br>
molar ratio is larger than 1/1.05, the reaction time is<br>
likely to become disadvantageously long and the resul-<br>
tant prepolymer is likely to be discolored. Also when<br>
the amount of TMG is too large so that the above<br>
-mentioned molar ratio is smaller than 1/3, the reac-<br>
tion time is likely to become disadvantageously long<br>
because it becomes necessary to volatilize the excess<br>
TMG.<br>
In the direct esterification method, free protons<br>
derived from terephthalic acid function as a catalyst.<br>
Therefore, in the direct esterification method, an es-<br>
terif ication catalyst is not always necessary. However,<br>
for improving the reaction rate, it is preferred to use<br>
an esterification catalyst. Preferred examples of es-<br>
terif ication catalysts include titanium alkoxides, such<br>
as titanium tetrabutoxide and titanium tetraisopropox-<br>
ide, and tin compounds, such as tin 2-ethylhexanoate.<br>
It is preferred that the amount of esterification cata-<br>
lyst used is from 0.02 to 1 % by weight, more prefera-<br>
bly from 0.05 to 0.5 % by weight, still more preferably<br>
from 0.08 to 0.2 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
terephthalic acid.<br>
For advancing the esterification reaction smoothly,<br>
it is preferred to add BHPT to a raw material mixture<br>
at the start of the reaction in an amount of 5 to 80 %<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the raw mate-<br>
rial mixture and the BHPT. When the production of BHPT<br>
is performed in a batchwise manner, the esterification<br>
reaction can be initiated by simultaneously charging<br>
the terephthalic acid and the TMG (raw materials) into<br>
a reactor. On the other hand, when the production of<br>
BHPT is performed in a continuous manner, the esterifi-<br>
cation reaction can be performed by continuously feed-<br>
ing a predetermined amount of a mixture of terephthalic<br>
acid and TMG into a reactor to perform a transesterifi-<br>
cation reaction, while withdrawing a predetermined<br>
amount of the reaction product (BHPT) from the reactor.<br>
The BHPT obtained by any of the above-mentioned<br>
methods is then subjected to polycondensation, thereby<br>
obtaining the prepolymer used in the present invention.<br>
The production of the prepolymer by polycondensa-<br>
tion is performed by subjecting the BHPT to reaction at<br>
a predetermined temperature under reduced pressure or<br>
in an inert gas atmosphere, while withdrawing by-<br>
produced TMG from the reaction system.<br>
It is preferred that such polycondensation reac-<br>
tion is performed at 230 to 280 Â°C. When the reaction<br>
is performed at a temperature lower than 230oC, disad-<br>
vantages are likely to occur that the formed prepolymer<br>
gets solidified and that the reaction time becomes long.<br>
On the other hand, when the reaction is performed at a<br>
temperature which is higher than 280 Â°C, a disadvantage<br>
is likely to occur that a vigorous heat decomposition<br>
of the formed prepolymer occurs, and the resultant pre-<br>
polymer cannot be used for producing a polymer having<br>
excellent color. It is preferred that the polyconden-<br>
sation reaction is performed at a temperature of from<br>
232 to 275 Â°C, more advantageously from 235 to 270 Â°C.<br>
As mentioned above, the polycondensation reaction<br>
can be performed under reduced pressure or in an inert<br>
gas atmosphere. When the reaction is performed under<br>
reduced pressure, the pressure is appropriately con-<br>
trolled, talcing into consideration the sublimation of<br>
the BHPT and polycondensation product, and the reaction<br>
rate. When the reaction is preformed in an inert gas<br>
atmosphere, it is important that the inside of a reac-<br>
tor used is always satisfactorily purged with inert gas<br>
to withdraw the by-produced TMG efficiently from the<br>
reaction system.<br>
When the BHPT is subjected to polycondensation, it<br>
is preferred to use a polycondensation catalyst. When a<br>
polycondensation catalyst is not used, the reaction time<br>
is likely to become disadvantageously long. Preferred<br>
examples of polycondensation catalysts include titanium<br>
alkoxides, such as titanium tetrabutoxide and titanium<br>
tetraisopropoxide; titanium dioxide and a double salt of<br>
titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide; antimony compounds.<br>
such as diantimony trioxide and an antimony acetate; and<br>
tin compounds, such as butyl stannate, butyltin tris(2-<br>
ethylhexoate) and tin 2-ethylhexanoate. From the view-<br>
point of improving the reaction rate and color of the<br>
final resin, titanium tetrabutoxide and tin 2-<br>
ethylhexanoate are especially preferred. The above-<br>
mentioned catalysts can be used individually or in com-<br>
bination. The amount of polycondensation catalyst used<br>
is preferably from 0.001 to 1 % by weight, more prefera-<br>
bly from 0.005 to 0.5 % by weight, still more preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 0.2 % by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
prepolymer. When a compound which functions as a poly-<br>
condensation catalyst is used in the production process<br>
of the BHPT, it is preferred that the total amount of<br>
the compounds capable of functioning as a polycondensa-<br>
tion catalyst is within the above-mentioned range.<br>
Examples of devices for conducting such polycon-<br>
densation reaction include a vertical agitation type<br>
polymerizer, a horizontal agitation type polymerizer<br>
equipped with one or two stirrers, a free-fall type<br>
thin film polymerizer having trays therein, and a thin<br>
film polymerizer in which the prepolymer is allowed to<br>
fall on a plane surface of an angled plate. Needless<br>
to say, these polymerizers can be used in combination.<br>
When a polycondensation of BHPT is performed in a<br>
batchwise manner, a single polymerizer can be employed<br>
from the start of the polycondensation reaction through<br>
the completion of the polycondensation reaction. Need-<br>
less to say, two or more polymerizers can be used. On<br>
the other hand, when a polycondensation of BHPT is per-<br>
formed in a continuous manner, for effectively advanc-<br>
ing the reaction, it is preferred to perform the reac-<br>
tion of from the polycondensation to the formation of<br>
the prepolymer in a stepwise manner, using two or more<br>
different polymerizers, wherein the two or more poly-<br>
merizers are operated under different temperature<br>
-pressure conditions.<br>
In the present invention, if desired, various ad-<br>
ditives can be incorporated into the PTT resin by co-<br>
polymerization or mixing. Examples of additives in-<br>
clude a delustering agent, a thermal stabilizer, a<br>
flame retardant, an antistatic agent, an anti-foaming<br>
agent, an orthochromatic agent, an antioxidant, an ul-<br>
traviolet absorber, a nucleating agent and a brightener.<br>
These additives can be added at any time during the<br>
production of the PTT resin.<br>
In the present invention, from the viewpoint of<br>
improving the whiteness and melt stability of the PTT<br>
resin, and suppressing the formation of organic sub-<br>
stances having a molecular weight of 300 or less, such<br>
as acrolein and an allyl alcohol, it is preferred that<br>
a stabilizer is added at an appropriate stage of the<br>
production of the PTT resin, more advantageously before<br>
the polycondensation of BHPT.<br>
Preferred examples of such stabilizers include<br>
pentavalent and/or trivalent phosphorus compounds and<br>
hindered phenol compounds.<br>
Examples of pentavalent and/or trivalent phospho-<br>
rus compounds include trimethyl phosphate, triethyl<br>
phosphate, tributyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate,<br>
trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tributyl<br>
phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, phosphoric acid and<br>
phosphorous acid. Among the above-mentioned phosphorus<br>
compounds, trimethyl phosphite is especially preferred.<br>
It is preferred that the amount of phosphorus compound<br>
added is in the range of from 2 to 250 ppm by weight,<br>
more advantageously from 5 to 150 ppm by weight, still<br>
more advantageously from 10 to 100 ppm by weight, in<br>
terms of the weight of phosphorus atom contained in the<br>
PTT.<br>
The hindered phenol compound is a phenol deriva-<br>
tive which has a substituent exhibiting a steric hin-<br>
drance at a position adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl<br>
group, and has at least one ester bond in its molecule.<br>
Examples of hindered phenol compounds include pen-<br>
taerythritol-tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate] , 1,1,3-tris(2-methyl-4 -<br>
hydroxy-5-tert-butylphenyl)butane, 1,3,5-trimethyl-<br>
2,4,6-tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)benzene,<br>
3,9-bis{2-[3-(3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-<br>
propionyloxy]-1,1-dimethylethy1}-2,4,8,10-<br>
tetraoxaspiro[5,5 Jundecane, l,3,5-tris(4-tert-butyl-3 -<br>
hydroxy-2,6-dimethylbenzene)isophthalic acid, triethyl<br>
glycol-bis[3-(3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
propionate], 1,6-hexanediol-bis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate], 2,2-thio-diethylene-bis[3-<br>
(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] and oc-<br>
tadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
propionate].<br>
Among the above-exemplified hindered phenol com-<br>
pounds , pentaerythritol-tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-<br>
4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] is preferred.<br>
It is preferred that the amount of hindered phenol<br>
compound added is in the range of from 0.001 to 1 % by<br>
weight, more advantageously from 0.005 to 0.5 % by<br>
weight, still more advantageously from 0.01 to 0.1 % by<br>
weight, based on the weight of the PTT resin. Needless<br>
to say, the above-mentioned stabilizers can be used in<br>
combination.<br>
Next, preferred examples of the polymerizer used<br>
in the method of the present invention are described<br>
below, referring to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an explanatory diagrammatic view of a<br>
specific example of a polymerizer used in the method of<br>
the present invention. In Fig. 1, trimethylene<br>
terephthalate prepolymer A is fed through inlet 2 into<br>
polymerizer 10 by means of transferring pump 1. Then,<br>
prepolymer A is introduced through perforated plate 3<br>
into the interior (polymerization reaction zone) of po-<br>
lymerizer 10, and is allowed to fall along and in con-<br>
tact with guides 5. The pressure in the interior (po-<br>
lymerization reaction zone) of polymerizer 10 is con-<br>
trolled so as to maintain a predetermined reduced pres-<br>
sure. If desired, inert gas E, such as nitrogen, can<br>
be introduced into the polymerizer through inlet 6 for<br>
a gas. TMG (which is distilled from the prepolymer)<br>
and inert gas E are discharged as exhaust gas D from<br>
vent 7. The resultant PTT resin B is withdrawn from<br>
the polymerizer by means of withdrawal pump 8 through<br>
outlet 9. Polymerizer 10 is heated by means of a<br>
heater or a jacket so as to maintain the temperature<br>
inside the polymerizer at a desired level.<br>
Fig. 2 shows explanatory diagrammatic views of<br>
specific examples of an inert gas absorption device and<br>
a polymerizer, which can be used in the present inven-<br>
tion when the inert gas is introduced to the polymeri-<br>
zation reaction zone in such a form as absorbed or con-<br>
tained in the PTT prepolymer, and the inert gas is<br>
caused to be released from the prepolymer in the polym-<br>
erization reaction zone under reduced pressure. In Fig.<br>
2, PTT prepolymer A is continuously fed through inlet N3<br>
into the inert gas absorption device Nl by means of<br>
transferring pump N2 . Then, the prepolymer is continu-<br>
ously fed through perforated plate 4 into the interior<br>
of the inert gas absorption device, into which inert<br>
gas E is introduced through inlet N6 for inert gas. In<br>
the inert gas absorption device, the prepolymer is al-<br>
lowed to fall along and in contact with guides 5. The<br>
resultant prepolymer (which contains and/or has ab-<br>
sorbed therein the inert gas) is fed through inlet 2<br>
into polymerizer 10 by means of transferring pump 7.<br>
The prepolymer is then continuously fed through perfo-<br>
rated plate 4 into the interior (polymerization reac-<br>
tion zone) of polymerizer 10, and is allowed to fall<br>
along and in contact with guides 5.<br>
The pressure in the interior (polymerization reac-<br>
tion zone) of polymerizer 10 is controlled so as to<br>
maintain a predetermined reduced pressure. The inert<br>
gas which is absorbed and/or contained in prepolymer A<br>
is released from the prepolymer in the polymerization<br>
reaction zone of the polymerizer. TMG (which is dis-<br>
tilled from the prepolymer) and the inert gas (which is<br>
introduced into the polymerizer) are discharged as ex-<br>
haust gas D through vent 7. The resultant PTT resin B<br>
is continuously withdrawn from outlet 9 by means of<br>
withdrawal pump 8. Inert gas absorption device Nl and<br>
polymerizer 10 are heated by means of a heater or a<br>
jacket so as to maintain the temperature inside the po-<br>
lymerizer at a desired level.<br>
In each of the above-mentioned methods, the PTT<br>
resin (obtained by a polymerization performed by allow-<br>
ing the prepolymer to fall along and in contact with<br>
the guide) which is accumulated at the bottom portion<br>
of the polymerizer is withdrawn from the outlet by<br>
means of a withdrawal pump. It is preferred that the<br>
withdrawal of the PTT resin from the polymerizer is<br>
performed in a manner such that the amount of the PTT<br>
resin accumulated at the bottom portion of the polymer-<br>
izer becomes as small as possible and constant. When<br>
the withdrawal of the PTT resin is performed in such a<br>
manner, it becomes easy to prevent the PTT resin from<br>
suffering disadvantages, such as discoloration (caused<br>
by heat decomposition), lowering of polymerization de-<br>
gree, and fluctuation of the quality. The amount of<br>
the PTT resin accumulated at the bottom portion of the<br>
polymerizer can be controlled by means of transferring<br>
pump 1 and withdrawal pump 8, while observing the<br>
amount of the PTT resin accumulated at the bottom por-<br>
tion of the polymerizer.<br>
The polymerizer used in the present invention can<br>
be equipped with a stirrer at the bottom portion<br>
thereof, but such a stirrer is not necessary. Thus, in<br>
the method of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
perform a polymerization reaction using a polymerizer<br>
having no rotary driving part, so that the polymerizer<br>
can be tightly sealed even when a polymerization is<br>
performed under high vacuum conditions. The sealabil-<br>
ity of the rotary driving part of the withdrawal pump<br>
is improved due to the liquid head, as compared to that<br>
of a polymerizer having a rotary driving part.<br>
The method of the present invention can be con-<br>
ducted using either a single polymerizer or a plurality<br>
of polymerizers. Further, it is also possible to use a<br>
multi-chamber polymerizer prepared by dividing an inner<br>
space of a single polymerizer into a plurality of hori-<br>
zontally adjacent chambers or a plurality of vertically<br>
adjacent chambers.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to in-<br>
crease, in advance, the polymerization degree of the<br>
prepolymer (which is to be subjected to the above-<br>
mentioned guide-wetting fall polymerization process) to<br>
some extent by at least one polymerization method se-<br>
lected from the following methods (a) to (d):<br>
(a) a polymerization method using a vertical agi-<br>
tation type polymerizer;<br>
(b) a polymerization method using a horizontal<br>
agitation type polymerizer;<br>
(c) a polymerization method using a free-fall po-<br>
lymerizer having a perforated plate,- and<br>
(d) a polymerization method using a thin film<br>
type polymerizer.<br>
Examples of horizontal agitation type polymeriz-<br>
ers include a screw-type polymerizer (such as a single-<br>
screw type polymerizer or a twin-screw type polymer-<br>
izer) and an independent agitation element type poly-<br>
merizer, which are described in "Hanno Kougaku Kenkyu-<br>
kai kenkyu Repoto: Riakutibupurosessingu Part 2 (Re-<br>
search Group on Reaction Engineering, Research Report:<br>
Reactive Processing Part 2)", Chapter 4, edited by The<br>
Society of Polymer Science, Japan, 1992.<br>
With respect to the free-fall polymerizer having a<br>
perforated plate, reference can be made to, for example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,596,067. When the free-fall polymer-<br>
izer is used, a polymerization is performed by allowing<br>
the prepolymer to fall freely from the holes of the<br>
perforated plate provided in the polymerizer. More<br>
specifically, a polytrimethylene terephthalate prepoly-<br>
mer in a molten form is allowed to fall freely from the<br>
holes of the perforated plate, thereby improving the<br>
polymerization degree of the prepolyraer. Herein, the<br>
expression "fall freely" means that the prepolymer is<br>
allowed to fall without contacting any materials (such<br>
as a guide and an inner wall of the polymerizer) which<br>
obstruct the fall of the prepolymer. The prepolymer is<br>
allowed to fall freely in the form of a film, a fiber,<br>
a droplet, a fog or the like. TMG which is produced<br>
during the polycondensation reaction is withdrawn from<br>
the reaction system during the fall of the prepolymer.<br>
In the above-mentioned method using a free-fall<br>
polymerizer, there is no particular limitation with re-<br>
spect to the shape of the holes of the perforated plate,<br>
and generally, the shape can be a circle, an ellipse, a<br>
triangle, a slit, a polygon, a star or the like. The<br>
cross-sectional area of each of the holes is generally<br>
in the range of from 0.01 to 100 cm , preferably from<br>
0.05 to 10 cm , more preferably from 0.1 to 5 cm .<br>
Further, the holes can have a nozzle or a short guide<br>
attached thereto. However, it is necessary that the<br>
nozzle or the short guide is attached to the holes so<br>
that the prepolymer can fall freely after having passed<br>
through the nozzle or after having fallen along and in<br>
contact with the guide. The distance between mutually<br>
adjacent holes of the perforated plate is generally<br>
from 1 to 500 mm, preferably from 5 to 100 mm, as meas-<br>
ured between the respective centers of the mutually ad-<br>
jacent holes. With respect to the distance over which<br>
the prepolymer (having passed through the holes of the<br>
perforated plate) falls freely, the distance is pref-<br>
erably from 0.3 to 50 m, more preferably from 0.5 to 20<br>
m. The amount of prepolymer which is caused to pass<br>
through the holes varies depending on the molecular<br>
weight of the prepolymer, but is generally in the range<br>
of from 10"4 to 104 liters/hr, preferably from 10"2 to<br>
102 liters/hr, more preferably from 0.1 to 50 liters/hr,<br>
per hole of the perforated plate. There is no particu-<br>
lar limitation with respect to the time for allowing<br>
the prepolymer to fall freely from the perforated plate,<br>
but in general, it is in the range of from 0.01 second<br>
to 1 hour. The thus obtained prepolymer may be with-<br>
drawn from the polymerizer. Alternatively, the ob-<br>
tained prepolymer may be recycled to the free-fall po-<br>
lymerizer, and subjected to further free-fall polymeri-<br>
zation. The recycling of the obtained prepolymer to<br>
the polymerizer has the following advantage. When the<br>
free-fall polymerization is performed while recycling<br>
the obtained prepolymer, the area of the prepolymer<br>
surface renewed per unit time is large, as compared to<br>
that in the case where the obtained prepolymer is not<br>
recycled. Therefore, by recycling the obtained polymer<br>
to the polymerizer, it becomes easy to achieve a de-<br>
sired degree of polymerization.<br>
Further examples of vertical and horizontal agi-<br>
tation type polymerizers include those which are de-<br>
scribed in "Kagaku Souchi Binran (Handbook of Chemical<br>
Apparatuses)", Chapter 11, edited by The Society of<br>
Chemical Engineers, Japan, 1989. There is no particu-<br>
lar limitation with respect to the shape of the vessel,<br>
and in general, the shape may be a vertical or horizon-<br>
tal cylinder. Further, there is no particular limita-<br>
tion with respect to the shape of the agitation element,<br>
and the shape of agitation element can be a paddle, an<br>
anchor, a turbine, a screw, a ribbon, double wings or<br>
the like.<br>
Examples of thin film type polymerizers include a<br>
wall-wetting fall polymerizer, and polymerizers<br>
equipped with a centrifugal thin film type heat ex-<br>
changer, a liquid film scraping type heat exchanger or<br>
the like. As an example of the above-mentioned wall<br>
-wetting fall polymerizer, there can be mentioned a po-<br>
lymerizer described in the above-mentioned "Kagaku<br>
Souchi Binran (Handbook of Chemical Apparatuses)",<br>
Chapter 11, p. 461, published by The Society of Chemi-<br>
cal Engineers, Japan, 1989. The thin film type poly-<br>
merizer may have a multi-tubular structure. Further,<br>
the prepolymer obtained by the wall-wetting fall may be<br>
recycled to the polymerizer, and subjected to further<br>
wall-wetting fall polymerization. Examples of liquid<br>
film scraping type heat exchangers and centrifugal thin<br>
film type heat exchangers include those which are de-<br>
scribed in "Netsukoukanki Sekkei Handobukku (Handbook<br>
for designing a heat exchanger)". Chapters 21-22, pub-<br>
lished by Kougakutosho Ltd., Japan, 1974.<br>
The production of a prepolymer from the raw mate-<br>
rials can be performed in either a batchwise manner or<br>
a continuous manner. When the prepolymer is produced<br>
in a batchwise manner, all of the raw materials or the<br>
whole of a reaction product (i.e., a prepolymer having<br>
a molecular weight lower than a desired level) are or<br>
is charged into a reaction vessel and reacted for a<br>
predetermined period of time, and then, the whole of<br>
the resultant reaction product is transferred to an-<br>
other reaction vessel. On the other hand, when the<br>
prepolymer is produced in a continuous manner, raw ma-<br>
terials or a reaction product (i.e., a prepolymer hav-<br>
ing a molecular weight lower than a desired level) are<br>
or is continuously fed into a reaction vessel, while<br>
continuously withdrawing the resultant reaction product<br>
from the reaction vessel. For obtaining a large amount<br>
of a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin having a uni-<br>
form quality, it is preferred that the production of<br>
the prepolymer is performed in a continuous manner.<br>
With respect to the material of the polymerizer<br>
used in the present invention, there is no particular<br>
limitation. In general, the material is selected from<br>
the group consisting of, for example, stainless steel,<br>
nickel and glass lining.<br>
Next, preferred examples of combinations of poly-<br>
merizers which are used for producing a PTT resin from<br>
the raw materials are described below, referring to the<br>
drawings. However, the combinations of polymerizers<br>
usable in the present invention should not be limited<br>
to those examples.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of a system used for pro-<br>
ducing the PTT resin from terephthalic acid and TMG as<br>
raw materials, which system comprises a combination of<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizers and a polymerizer<br>
used for performing the guide-wetting fall process. In<br>
Fig. 3, mixture C containing raw materials (terephthalic<br>
acid and TMG) and a catalyst is charged into esterifica-<br>
tion reaction vessel 11, and subjected to an esterifica-<br>
tion reaction for a predetermined period of time, while<br>
stirring by means of agitation element 12, thereby ob-<br>
taining bis(3-hydroxylpropyl)-terephthalate (BHPT). The<br>
atmosphere inside the reaction vessel is an atmosphere<br>
of inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, and/or an atmosphere<br>
containing water (steam) and/or TMG which are distilled<br>
from a reaction mixture in the reaction vessel. In gen-<br>
eral, the pressure inside the reaction vessel is con-<br>
trolled so as to be around atmospheric pressure. The<br>
water and TMG (which are distilled from the reaction<br>
mixture) and/or excess nitrogen gas are discharged from<br>
vent 13 as exhaust gas D. The BHPT obtained in esteri-<br>
fication reaction vessel 11 is transferred by means of<br>
transferring pump 14 to first vertical agitation type<br>
polymerizer 15, where the BHPT is subjected to polymeri-<br>
zation for a predetermined period of time, while stir-<br>
ring by means of agitation element 16, thereby obtaining<br>
a low molecular weight prepolymer A. The inside of the<br>
polymerizer is under reduced pressure, or inert gas<br>
(such as nitrogen gas) is flowed through the inside of<br>
the polymerizer. The water and TMG (which are distilled<br>
from polymer A) and/or excess nitrogen gas is discharged<br>
from vent 17 as exhaust gas D.<br>
The low molecular weight prepolymer A obtained in<br>
first vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 is trans-<br>
ferred by means of transferring pump 18 to second ver-<br>
tical agitation type polymerizer 19, where the prepoly-<br>
mer A is subjected to polymerization for a predeter-<br>
mined period of time, while stirring by means of agita-<br>
tion element 20, thereby obtaining a prepolymer. The<br>
inside of the polymerizer is under reduced pressure, or<br>
inert gas (such as nitrogen gas) is flowed through the<br>
inside of the polymerizer. The water and TMG (which<br>
are distilled from the prepolymer A) and/or excess ni-<br>
trogen gas is discharged from vent 21 as exhaust gas D.<br>
The prepolymer A having an increased molecular weight,<br>
which is obtained in second vertical agitation type po-<br>
lymerizer 19, is transferred and continuously fed<br>
through inlet 2 into polymerizer 10 by means of trans-<br>
ferring pump 1. In polymerizer 10, the prepolymer A is<br>
caused to pass through perforated plate 3, and is in-<br>
troduced into the interior (polymerization reaction<br>
zone) of the polymerizer, where the prepolymer A is al-<br>
lowed to fall along and in contact with guides 5. The<br>
pressure in the polymerization reaction zone is con-<br>
trolled so as to be a predetermined reduced pressure.<br>
TMG (distilled from the prepolymer A) and inert gas E<br>
(which is optionally introduced into the polymerizer<br>
through inlet 6 for a gas) if any, are discharged from<br>
vent 7. The obtained PTT resin B is continuously with-<br>
drawn from outlet 9 by means of withdrawal pump 8.<br>
Esterification reaction vessel 11, first vertical<br>
agitation type polymerizer 15, second vertical agita-<br>
tion type polymerizer 19, polymerizer 10, conduits and<br>
transferring pumps are heated by means of a heater or a<br>
jacket so as to maintain the temperatures of the reac-<br>
tion vessel, polymerizers, conduits and pumps at de-<br>
sired levels.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an example of a system used for pro-<br>
ducing the PTT resin from terephthalic acid and TMG as<br>
raw materials, which system comprises a combination of<br>
a vertical agitation type polymerizer, a horizontal<br>
agitation type polymerizer and a polymerizer for per-<br>
forming the guide-wetting fall process. In Fig. 4,<br>
mixture C of raw materials (terephthalic acid and TMG)<br>
and a catalyst is charged into esterification reaction<br>
vessel 11, and subjected to an esterification reaction<br>
for a predetermined period of time, while stirring by<br>
means of agitation element 12, thereby obtaining BHPT.<br>
The atmosphere inside the reaction vessel is an atmos-<br>
phere of inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, and/or an at-<br>
mosphere containing water (steam) and/or TMG which are<br>
distilled from a reaction mixture in the reaction ves-<br>
sel. In general, the pressure inside the reaction ves-<br>
sel is controlled to approximately atmospheric pressure.<br>
The water and TMG (which are distilled from the reac-<br>
tion mixture) and/or excess nitrogen gas are discharged<br>
from vent 13 as exhaust gas D. The BHPT obtained in<br>
esterification reaction vessel 11 is transferred by<br>
means of transferring pump 14 to first vertical agita-<br>
tion type polymerizer 15, where the BHPT is subjected<br>
to polymerization for a predetermined period of time,<br>
while stirring by means of agitation element 16,<br>
thereby obtaining a low molecular weight prepolymer A.<br>
The inside of the polymerizer is under reduced pressure,<br>
or inert gas (such as nitrogen gas) is flowed through<br>
the inside of the polymerizer. The water and TMG<br>
(which are distilled from polymer A) and/or excess ni-<br>
trogen gas is discharged from vent 17 as exhaust gas D.<br>
The low molecular weight prepolymer A obtained in<br>
first vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 is trans-<br>
ferred by means of transferring pump 20 to horizontal<br>
agitation type polymerizer 22, where the prepolymer A<br>
is subjected to polymerization for a predetermined pe-<br>
riod, while stirring by means of agitation element 23,<br>
thereby obtaining a prepolymer A having an increased<br>
molecular weight. The inside of the polymerizer is un-<br>
der reduced pressure, or inert gas (such as nitrogen<br>
gas) is flowed through the inside of the polymerizer.<br>
The water and TMG (which are distilled from polymer A)<br>
and/or excess nitrogen gas is discharged from vent 24<br>
as exhaust gas D. The prepolyraer A having an increased<br>
molecular weight, which is obtained in horizontal agi-<br>
tation type polymerizer 22, is transferred and continu-<br>
ously fed through inlet 2 into polymerizer 10 by means<br>
of transferring pump 1. In polymerizer 10, the pre-<br>
polymer A is caused to pass through perforated plate 3,<br>
and is introduced into the interior (polymerization re-<br>
action zone) of the polymerizer, where the prepolymer A<br>
is allowed to fall along and in contact with guides 5.<br>
The pressure in the polymerization reaction zone is<br>
controlled to a predetermined reduced pressure. TMG<br>
(distilled from the prepolymer A) and inert gas E<br>
(which is optionally introduced into the polymerizer<br>
through inlet 6 for a gas) if any, are discharged from<br>
vent 7. The obtained PTT resin B is continuously with-<br>
drawn from outlet 9 by means of withdrawal pump 8.<br>
Esterification reaction vessel 11, vertical agi-<br>
tation type polymerizer 15, horizontal agitation type<br>
polymerizer 22, polymerizer 10, conduits and transfer-<br>
ring pumps are heated by means of a heater or a jacket<br>
so as to maintain the temperatures of the reaction ves-<br>
sel, polymerizers, conduits and pumps at desired levels.<br>
Each of Figs. 5 and 6 shows an example of a sys-<br>
tem used for producing the PTT resin from DMT and TMG<br>
as raw materials . In each of Figs . 5 and 6 , mixture C<br>
of raw materials and a catalyst is charged into first<br>
transesterification reaction vessel 25, and the resul-<br>
tant reaction product is transferred to second trans-<br>
esterif ication reaction vessel 29. In each of first<br>
transesterification reaction vessel 25 and second<br>
transesterification reaction vessel 29, mixture C of<br>
raw materials is subjected to a transesterification re-<br>
action for a predetermined period of time, while stir-<br>
ring by means of agitation element (26 or 30), thereby<br>
obtaining BHPT. The atmosphere inside the reaction<br>
vessel is an atmosphere of inert gas, such as nitrogen<br>
gas, and/or an atmosphere containing methanol and/or<br>
TMG which are distilled from a reaction mixture in the<br>
reaction vessel. In general, the pressure inside the<br>
reaction vessel is controlled to approximately atmos-<br>
pheric pressure. The vent of each of the reaction ves-<br>
sels is connected to a fractionating column. TMG dis-<br>
tilled from the fractionating column is recycled to the<br>
reaction vessel. Methanol and excessive nitrogen are<br>
discharged from the fractionating column. The obtained<br>
BHPT is subjected to polycondensation in the same man-<br>
ner as mentioned above in connection with the systems<br>
shown in Figs. 3 and 4, thereby obtaining prepolymer A<br>
and then, PTT resin B.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be de-<br>
scribed in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples, which should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion .<br>
In the following Examples and Comparative Examples,<br>
various measurements and analyses were conducted by the<br>
following methods.<br>
(1) Intrinsic viscosity [?]<br>
Intrinsic viscosity [?] of a polymer (i.e., a pre-<br>
polymer or a final polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
resin) was measured by means of an Oswald viscometer.<br>
Specifically, with respect to each of o-chlorophenol<br>
solutions of a polymer, which have different concentra-<br>
tions [C] (g/100 ml) of the resin, the relative viscos-<br>
ity [?sp] was measured at 35 Â°C. The obtained {?sp/C)<br>
values were plotted against the concentrations of the<br>
resin, and the resultant gradient is extrapolated into<br>
the zero (0) concentration to thereby obtain an intrin-<br>
sic viscosity [?] of the polymer. That is, the intrin-<br>
sic viscosity [?] of the polymer was calculated by the<br>
following formula:<br>
102<br>
[?] = lim (T]sp/C)<br>
.<br>
(2) Crystalline melting point<br>
The crystalline melting point of a prepolymer was<br>
measured by means of a differential scanning calorime-<br>
ter (trade name-. Pyris 1; manufactured and sold by<br>
Perkin Elmer, Inc., U.S.A.) under the following condi-<br>
tions :<br>
Measuring temperature: 0 to 280 Â° C<br>
Rate of temperature elevation: 10 â¢ C/min<br>
Specifically, a temperature at which an endother-<br>
mic peak ascribed to the melting of a crystal is ob-<br>
served in the obtained differential scanning calo-<br>
rimetry (DSC) chart was defined as the crystalline<br>
melting point of the prepolymer, wherein the determina-<br>
tion of the peak was conducted using an analytic soft-<br>
ware attached to the calorimeter.<br>
(3) Terminal carboxyl group content<br>
1 g of a polymer (i.e., a prepolymer or a final<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate resin) was dissolved in<br>
25 ml of benzyl alcohol, followed by addition of 25 ml<br>
of chloroform, thereby obtaining a mixture. The ob-<br>
talned mixture was subjected to a titration with a 1/50<br>
N solution of potassium hydroxide in benzyl alcohol.<br>
From the obtained titration value VA (ml) and a blank<br>
test value Vo (ml) which is obtained by a titration<br>
conducted in the absence of the polymer, the terminal<br>
carboxyl group content was calculated by the following<br>
formula:<br>
Terminal carboxyl group content (meq/kg)<br>
= (VA - Vo) x 20 .<br>
(4) Total terminal group content<br>
The total amount of terminal groups per kg of a<br>
sample is defined as the total terminal group content.<br>
Specifically, the total terminal group content (meq/kg)<br>
is calculated from the intrinsic viscosity [?] by the<br>
following formula:<br>
Total terminal group content (meq/kg)<br>
= 1,000/(polymerization degree x 206) x 2 x 1,000<br>
wherein:<br>
the polymerization degree<br>
= intrinsic viscosity [?] x 144.6 - 26.2.<br>
(5) Molecular weight distribution<br>
The ratio of the weight average molecular weight<br>
(Mw) to the number average molecular weight (Mn) (Mw/Mn<br>
ratio) was used to evaluate the molecular weight dis-<br>
tribution of a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin.<br>
The Mw and Mn of a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
Specifically, the GPC was conducted under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
Apparatus: chromatograph model HLC-8120 (manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Tosoh Corporation, Japan);<br>
Columns: HFIP804-803 (30 cm) (manufactured and<br>
sold by Showa Denko K.K., Japan) (x 2);<br>
Carrier: hexafluoroisopropanol;<br>
Measurement temperature: 40 Â°C; and<br>
Flow rate : 0.5 ml/min.<br>
A calibration curve used in the determination of the Mn<br>
and Mw was obtained by using standard polymethyl<br>
methacrylate (PMMA) samples (manufactured and sold by<br>
Polymer Laboratories Ltd., U.K.). The molecular<br>
weights of the PMMA samples used were 620, 1,680, 3,805,<br>
7,611, 13,934, 24,280, 62,591 and 186,000, respectively.<br>
(6) Color (L-value and b*-value)<br>
A pellet of a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
(PTT) was heated at 100 Â°C for 10 minutes to partially<br>
crystallize the pellet. The color (in terms of L-value<br>
and b*-value thereof) of the obtained partially crys-<br>
tallized pellet was measured by means of a color meas-<br>
uring computer (manufactured and sold by SUGA TEST IN-<br>
STRUMENTS Co., Ltd., Japan).<br>
Separately from the above, another pellet of PTT<br>
resin was heated at 180 Â°C for 24 hours, and then, the<br>
color thereof was measured in the same manner as men-<br>
tioned above, except that the heating at 100 Â°C for<br>
partially crystallizing the PTT resin was not conducted<br>
since the pellet was already crystallized by the above<br>
-mentioned heating at 180 Â°C. The thus obtained<br>
L-value and b*-value of the PTT resin were used as a<br>
yardstick of the discoloration of the PTT resin caused<br>
by the heating.<br>
(7) Pellet size<br>
Approximately 2 g of pellets were used as sample<br>
pellets . The total weight of the sample pellets was<br>
accurately weighed, and the number of sample pellets<br>
was counted. From the total weight and the number of<br>
the sample pellets, the average weight of the pellets<br>
was calculated.<br>
(8) Polymer powder<br>
The amount of polymer powder attached to the sur-<br>
face of pellets was measured as follows.<br>
1. 1 kg of pellets were placed In a beaker filled<br>
with water.<br>
2. The pellets in the beaker were stirred for 5<br>
minutes to wash away the polymer powder from<br>
the surface of the pellets.<br>
3. The contents of the beaker were filtered<br>
through a 30-mesh filter. Then, the pellets on<br>
the filter were repeatedly washed with water so<br>
that broken pieces of pellets and/or polymer<br>
powder would not remain on the pellets.<br>
4. The resultant filtrate obtained in step 3 above<br>
was filtered again through a 300-mesh filter.<br>
The residue on the filter was dried at 80 "C<br>
under reduced pressure, namely, under a pres-<br>
sure of 1 kPa. The dried residue was weighed,<br>
and the measured weight was defined as the<br>
weight of the polymer powder.<br>
(9) Crystallinity<br>
The density of the pellets was measured in accor-<br>
dance with JIS-L-1013, in which the density of<br>
the pellets was measured by gradient density tube<br>
method in which a gradient density tube prepared using<br>
tetrachlorocarbon and n-heptanone was used. The meas-<br>
urement was conducted with respect to 10 pellets, and<br>
the average of the measured values was defined as the<br>
density of the pellets. Using the obtained value (ps)<br>
of the density, the crystallinity of the pellets was<br>
calculated by the following formula:<br>
Xc (%) = {?c x (?s - ?a)}/(?s x (?c - ?a)&gt; x<br>
100<br>
wherein pa is 1.300 g/cm3 which is an amor-<br>
phous density of trimethylene terephthalate<br>
homopolymer, pc is 1.431 g/cm3 which is a<br>
crystal density of trimethylene terephtha-<br>
late homopolymer, and ps represents a den-<br>
sity (g/cm3) of the pellets.<br>
Example 1<br>
Using the device as shown in Fig. 1, production of<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate resin B was conducted as<br>
follows. A polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) pre-<br>
polymer A having an intrinsic viscosity [?] of 0.5 dl/g,<br>
a terminal carboxyl group ratio of 7 % and a crystal-<br>
line melting point of 230 Â° C was fed through, prepolymer<br>
feeding inlet 2 into polymerizer 10 by means of trans-<br>
ferring pump 1 . In polymerizer 10 , PTT prepolymer A<br>
was caused to pass through the holes of perforated<br>
plate 3 in a molten form at 260 Â°C (temperature of the<br>
molten polymer) and at a rate of 10 g/min per hole, and<br>
then, was allowed to fall along and in contact with<br>
guides 5 at an atmospheric temperature of 260 oC, which<br>
is the same as the temperature of the molten prepolymer<br>
(having passed through the holes of perforated plate 3),<br>
under reduced pressure, namely, under a pressure of 10<br>
Pa, to thereby perform a polymerization to obtain PTT<br>
resin B. The obtained PTT resin B was withdrawn from<br>
outlet 9 by means of withdrawal pump 8. The perforated<br>
plate had a thickness of 50 mm and nine holes, each<br>
having a diameter of 1 mm, in which the holes of the<br>
perforated plate are arranged such that a checkered<br>
pattern is formed when lines connecting the holes are<br>
drawn on the surface of the perforated plate. The<br>
guide was a wire made of stainless steel, which wire<br>
had a circular cross- section, and had a diameter of 3<br>
mm and a length of 5 m. Guides 5 were attached to per-<br>
forated plate 4 so that each hole of perforated plate 5<br>
had one guide 5 attached thereto. The withdrawal pump<br>
was operated while observing the polymer inside the po-<br>
lymerizer through observing window 4, so that almost no<br>
polymer was accumulated at the bottom of the polymer-<br>
izer. (The above-mentioned prepolymer A contained ti-<br>
tanium tetrabutoxide (polymerization catalyst) and<br>
trimethyl phosphate (stabilizer) in amounts of 0.1 % by<br>
weight and 100 ppm by weight (in terms of the weight of<br>
phosphorus), respectively, both of which are based on<br>
the weight of the prepolymer.) The results are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
In the above-mentioned polymerization, the reten-<br>
tion time was 60 minutes. The retention time herein is<br>
a value calculated by dividing the total amount of the<br>
prepolymer and polymer inside the polymerizer by the<br>
feeding rate of the prepolymer.<br>
With respect to the staining of the lower surface<br>
of the perforated plate, which was caused by the foam-<br>
ing of the prepolymer immediately below the holes of<br>
the perforated plate, the level of staining was low.<br>
The obtained PTT resin had a high molecular weight, a<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution, a low terminal<br>
carboxyl group content, and excellent color. Further,<br>
the degree of discoloration of the obtained PTT resin<br>
occurring by heating was very small.<br>
The obtained PTT resin was solidified in cool wa-<br>
ter having a temperature of 5 Â°C, and then, cut into<br>
pellets, each having a weight of 20 rag. The amount of<br>
polymer powder (which had adhered to the pellets) was<br>
as low as 0.01 % by weight, and the pellets had a crys-<br>
tallinity of 5 %. Therefore, the obtained pellets were<br>
not easily broken and easy to handle.<br>
Examples 2 to 4<br>
In each of Examples 2 to 4, polymerization was<br>
performed in substantially the same manner as in Exam-<br>
ple 1, except that polymerization was performed under<br>
the conditions indicated in Table 1. The results are<br>
shown in Table 1. In each of Examples 2 to 4, with re-<br>
spect to the staining of the lower surface of the per-<br>
forated plate, which was caused by the foaming of the<br>
prepolymer immediately below the holes of the perfo-<br>
rated plate, the level of staining was low. The ob-<br>
tained PTT resins had a high molecular weight, a narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution, a low terminal carboxyl<br>
group content, and excellent color. Further, with re-<br>
spect to each of the obtained PTT resins, the degree of<br>
discoloration occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 4<br>
In each of Comparative Examples 1 to 4, polymeri-<br>
zation was performed in substantially the same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that the polymerization was<br>
performed under the conditions indicated in Table 1 .<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
In Comparative Example 1, the temperature of the<br>
molten preploymer introduced into the polymerization<br>
reaction zone was too high, so that a vigorous foaming<br>
of the prepolymer occurred just below the holes of the<br>
perforated plate, thereby markedly staining the lower<br>
surface of the perforated plate. The obtained PTT<br>
resin was discolored to assume a yellow color and the<br>
color of the PTT resin thereof was non-uniform. Fur-<br>
ther, the PTT resin suffered severe discoloration by<br>
heating.<br>
In Comparative Example 2, the temperature of the<br>
molten preploymer introduced into the polymerization<br>
reaction zone was too low, so that the prepolymer was<br>
solidified, and hence, the prepolymer could not pass<br>
through the holes of the perforated plate.<br>
In Comparative Example 3, the prepolymer had an<br>
intrinsic viscosity [?] of 0.18 dl/g, which was too low,<br>
so that a vigorous foaming of the prepolymer occurred<br>
just below the holes of the perforated plate, thereby<br>
markedly staining the lower surface of the perforated<br>
plate, and the inner wall of the polymerizer. The ob-<br>
tained PTT resin contained a large amount of black im-<br>
purities (heat deterioration products). Further, the<br>
obtained PTT had a low molecular weight.<br>
In Comparative Example 4. polymerization in the<br>
polymerizer was performed under atmospheric pressure.<br>
As a result, it was found that the polymerization de-<br>
gree of the obtained PTT was not increased, but rather<br>
lowered by the heat decomposition.<br>
Example 5<br>
A polymerization was performed in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 1, except that the guide<br>
was changed to a jungle gym-like body, in which wires<br>
(each having a diameter of 3 mm) were three<br>
-dimensionally connected with one another at intervals<br>
of 30 mm as viewed in the vertical direction and at in-<br>
tervals of 50 mm as viewed in the horizontal direction.<br>
The upper end portions of the wires extending in the<br>
vertical direction were attached to the holes of the<br>
perforated plate. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
With respect to the staining of the lower surface of<br>
the perforated plate, which was caused by the foaming<br>
of the prepolymer immediately below the holes of the<br>
perforated plate, the level of staining was low.<br>
The obtained PTT resin had a high molecular weight<br>
a narrow molecular weight distribution, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained PTT resin occurred even by heating.<br>
Example 6<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 1, except that the guide was<br>
changed to a wire mesh, in which wires (each having a<br>
diameter of 3 mm) were two-dimensionally connected with<br>
one another at intervals of 30 mm as viewed in the ver-<br>
tical direction and at intervals of 50 mm as viewed in<br>
the horizontal direction. The upper end portions of<br>
the wires extending in the vertical direction were at-<br>
tached to the holes of the perforated plate. The re-<br>
sults are shown in Table 1.<br>
With respect to the staining of the lower surface<br>
of the perforated plate, which was caused by the foam-<br>
ing of the prepolymer immediately below the holes of<br>
the perforated plate, the level of staining was low.<br>
The obtained PTT resin had a high molecular weight,<br>
a narrow molecular weight distribution, a low terminal<br>
carboxyl group content, and excellent color. Further,<br>
the degree of discoloration of the obtained PTT resin<br>
occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example 7<br>
Using the production system as shown in Fig. 3,<br>
130 kg of a polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin<br>
was continuously produced per day, in which<br>
terephthalic acid and TMG were used as raw materials.<br>
With respect to the apparatuses used in the above-<br>
mentioned production system, each of esterification re-<br>
action vessel 11, first vertical agitation type poly-<br>
raerizer 15 and second vertical agitation type polymer-<br>
izer 19 was a vertical agitation type polymerizer<br>
equipped with a stirrer having paddle-shaped agitation<br>
blades, and polymerizer 10 was the same as used in Ex-<br>
ample 5 .<br>
Specifically, production of the PTT resin was per-<br>
formed as follows. Terephthalic acid and TMG were<br>
mixed together (terephthalic acid/TMG molar ratio =<br>
1/1.5), followed by addition of 0.1 % by weight of ti-<br>
tanium tetrabutoxide, based on the weight of<br>
terephthalic acid, thereby obtaining a mixture (in the<br>
form of a slurry). The obtained mixture was continu-<br>
ously charged into esterification reaction vessel 11,<br>
and a polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 1, except that the polymeri-<br>
zation was performed under the conditions indicated in<br>
Tables 1 and 2, thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate (PTT) resin. During the polymerization.<br>
trimethyl phosphate (stabilizer) was continuously added<br>
to first vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 in an<br>
amount of 20 ppm by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
polymer. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The prepolymer which was fed into the final poly-<br>
merizer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present<br>
invention, and the obtained PTT resin had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example 8<br>
Using the production system as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
130 kg of a polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin<br>
was continuously produced per day, wherein terephthalic<br>
acid and TMG were used as raw materials. With respect<br>
to the apparatuses used in the above-mentioned produc-<br>
tion system, each of esterification reaction vessel 11<br>
and first vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 was a<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer equipped with a<br>
stirrer having paddle-shaped agitation blades; horizon-<br>
tal agitation type polymerizer 22 was equipped with a<br>
uniaxial stirrer having disc-shaped agitation blades;<br>
and polymerizer 10 was the same as used in Example 5.<br>
Specifically, production of the PTT resin was per-<br>
formed as follows. Terephthalic acid and TMG were<br>
mixed together (terephthalic acid/TMG molar ratio =<br>
1/1.5), followed by addition of 0.1 % by weight of ti-<br>
tanium tetrabutoxide, based on the weight of<br>
terephthalic acid, thereby obtaining mixture C (in the<br>
form of a slurry). The obtained mixture C was continu-<br>
ously charged into esterification reaction vessel 11,<br>
and polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 1, except that the polymeri-<br>
zation was performed under the conditions indicated in<br>
Tables 1 and 3, thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate (PTT) resin. During the polymerization,<br>
trimethyl phosphate (stabilizer) was continuously added<br>
to first vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 in an<br>
amount of 20 ppm by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
polymer. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The prepolymer which was fed into the final poly-<br>
merizer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present<br>
invention, and the obtained PTT resin had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained PTT resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example 9<br>
Using the production system as shown in Fig. 5,<br>
130 kg of polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin<br>
was continuously produced per day, wherein DMT and TMG<br>
were used as raw materials . With respect to the appa-<br>
ratuses used in the above-mentioned production system,<br>
each of first transesterification reaction vessel 25<br>
and second transesterification reaction vessel 29 was a<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer equipped with a<br>
stirrer having turbine blades (26 or 30); each of first<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 and second ver-<br>
tical agitation type polymerizer 19 was equipped with a<br>
stirrer having paddle-shaped agitation blades (16 or<br>
20); and polymerizer 10 was the same as the polymerizer<br>
used in Example 5, except that the number of holes of<br>
the perforated plate was changed to four (wherein the<br>
four holes were arranged such that a square is formed<br>
when lines connecting the holes are drawn on the sur-<br>
face of the perforated plate); the length of each guide<br>
5 was changed to 9 m, and the length of the polymerizer<br>
casing was increased accordingly. During the operation<br>
of polymerizer 10, the prepolymer was caused to pass<br>
through the holes of the perforated plate at a rate of<br>
23 g/min per hole.<br>
Specifically, production of the PTT resin was per-<br>
formed as follows. DMT and a mixture of TMG and tita-<br>
nium tetrabutoxide (amount of titanium tetrabutoxide =<br>
0.1 % by weight, based on the weight of DMT) (DMT/TMG<br>
molar ratio = 1/1.5) were continuously charged into es-<br>
terification reaction vessel 11, and polymerization was<br>
performed under the conditions indicated in Tables 1<br>
and 4, thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late (PTT) resin. During the polymerization, trimethyl<br>
phosphate (stabilizer) was continuously added to first<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer 15 in an amount of<br>
20 ppm by weight, based on the weight of the polymer.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
The obtained polytrimethylene terephthalate resin<br>
was immersed in cool water having a temperature of 5 Â° C<br>
to thereby solidify the PTT resin. The solidified PTT<br>
resin was cut into pellets, each having a weight of 20<br>
mg. The amount of polymer powder (which had adhered to<br>
the pellets) was as low as 0.01 % by weight, and the<br>
pellets had a crystallinity as low as 5 %. Therefore,<br>
the obtained pellets were not easily broken and easy to<br>
handle.<br>
Example 10<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 9, except that nitrogen gas E<br>
was introduced through inlet 6 into polymerizer 10 in<br>
an amount indicated in Table 1, thereby obtaining a<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin (the condi-<br>
tions employed in this Example are indicated in Tables<br>
1 and 4). The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example11<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 9, except that the production<br>
system as shown in Fig. 6 was employed instead of the<br>
production system as shown in Fig. 5 (i.e., except that<br>
horizontal agitation type polymerizer 22 equipped with<br>
a uniaxial stirrer having disc-shaped agitation blades<br>
23 was used instead of second vertical agitation type<br>
polymerizer 19), thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin (the conditions employed in this<br>
Example are indicated in Tables 1 and 5). The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example 12<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 11, except that nitrogen gas<br>
E was introduced through inlet 6 into polymerizer 10 in<br>
an amount indicated in Table 1, thereby obtaining a<br>
polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin (the condi-<br>
tions employed in this Example are indicated in Tables<br>
1 and 5).<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Examples 13 and 14<br>
In each of Examples 13 and 14, polymerization was<br>
performed in substantially the same manner as in Exam-<br>
ple 12 (in which the production system as shown in Fig.<br>
6 was employed), except that, in Example 13, guides 5<br>
provided in polymerizer 10 were changed to chains, each<br>
formed by the combination of elliptical rings (the di-<br>
ameter of a wire forming each ring was 3 mm; the major<br>
axis of the ellipse defined by each ring was 50 mm; and<br>
the curvature of each ring was 2 0 mmF)) , and that, in<br>
Example 14, guides 5 provided in polymerizer 10 were<br>
changed to wires, each having a diameter of 5 mm and<br>
having welded thereto discs (each having a diameter of<br>
20 mmF) and a thickness of 3 mm) at intervals of 200 mm<br>
in a manner such that the wire penetrates the center of<br>
each disc, thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene<br>
terephthalate resin (the conditions employed in these<br>
Examples are indicated in Tables 1 and 6) . The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
The prepolymer obtained in Example 13 was immersed<br>
in cool water having a temperature of 5 Â°C to thereby<br>
solidify the prepolymer. The solidified prepolymer was<br>
then cut into pellets, and the pellets were dried at<br>
120 Â°C in air. 100 kg of the dried pellets were<br>
charged into a 300 liter tumbling solid-phase polymer-<br>
izer, and solid-phase polymerization was performed at<br>
205 Â°C for 72 hours, while flowing nitrogen gas into<br>
the polymerizer at a rate of 100 liters/hr, thereby<br>
obtaining a polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) resin.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The obtained PTT resin had a satisfactorily high<br>
molecular weight. However, the obtained resin had a<br>
broad molecular weight distribution. Further, the ob-<br>
tained pellets not only had attached thereto polymer<br>
powder in an amount as large as 1.0 % by weight, but<br>
also had a crystallinity as high as 55 %, and hence.<br>
the obtained, pellet was brittle. If it is attempted to<br>
transfer the obtained pellets by means of a feeder or a<br>
pneumatic conveyer, the pellets would be broken,<br>
thereby forming a large amount of polymer powder.<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 12, except that the amount of<br>
a polytrimethylene terephthalate resin produced per day<br>
was reduced to 75 kg, and that polymerizer 10 was not<br>
used, thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late resin. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The obtained PTT resin had a low polymerization<br>
degree, a broad molecular weight distribution and a<br>
high terminal carboxyl group content. Further, the de-<br>
gree of discoloration of the obtained resin occurring<br>
by heating was very large<br>
Example 15<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 1, except that the system as<br>
shown in Fig. 2 was employed in which inert gas was in-<br>
troduced into the polymerizer by means of inert gas ab-<br>
sorption device Nl, and that the polymerization was<br>
performed under the conditions indicated in Table 1.<br>
Perforated plate N4 provided in inert gas absorption<br>
device Nl had nine holes, each having a diameter of 1<br>
mm, in which the holes of the perforated plate are ar-<br>
ranged such that a checkered pattern is formed when<br>
lines connecting the holes are drawn on the surface of<br>
the perforated plate. Each of guides N5 used in inert<br>
gas absorption apparatus Nl was a wire made of<br>
stainless steel, which had a circular cross-section,<br>
and had a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 3 m. Guides<br>
N5 were attached to perforated plate N4 so that each<br>
hole of perforated plate N5 had one guide N5 attached<br>
thereto. Nitrogen gas E was fed into the gas absorp-<br>
tion apparatus so that the internal pressure thereof<br>
was 0.11 Pa. Prepolymer N5" was allowed to fall along<br>
and in contact with guides N5 so as to cause the pre-<br>
polymer to absorb and contain nitrogen gas. Transfer-<br>
ring pump N7 was operated while observing the prepoly-<br>
mer inside the gas absorption apparatus through the ob-<br>
serving window, so that almost no prepolymer was accu-<br>
mulated at the bottom of the gas absorption apparatus.<br>
Prepolymer A withdrawn from inert gas absorption appa-<br>
ratus Nl contained very small bubbles. After conduct-<br>
ing the production of the PTT resin for a while in the<br>
above-mentioned manner, the feeding of nitrogen gas<br>
E into inert gas absorption apparatus Nl was stopped.<br>
and the difference in the internal pressure of inert<br>
gas absorption apparatus Nl before and after the stop-<br>
ping of the feeding of nitrogen gas was measured. As a<br>
result, it was found that the difference in the amount<br>
of nitrogen gas was 0.5 mg per gram of the prepolymer.<br>
This difference in the amount of nitrogen gas was de-<br>
fined as the amount of nitrogen gas which was absorbed<br>
by and contained in the prepolymer. Using the thus ob-<br>
tained amount of nitrogen gas absorbed by and contained<br>
in the prepolymer, the amount of nitrogen gas intro-<br>
duced into the polymerizer was calculated on the as-<br>
sumption that all nitrogen gas contained in the pre-<br>
polymer was introduced into the polymerizer. The re-<br>
sults are shown in Table 1. When the prepolymer fal-<br>
ling in polymerizer 10 was observed through observing<br>
window 4, it was found that the prepolymer was in a<br>
foaming state and contained a large amount of bubbles.<br>
The resultant polytrimethylene terephthalate resin had<br>
a high molecular weight, a narrow molecular weight dis-<br>
tribution and a low terminal carboxyl group content,<br>
and excellent color. Further, the degree of discolora-<br>
tion of the obtained resin occurring by heating was<br>
very small.<br>
Example 16<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 9, except that the second<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer was replaced by a<br>
free-fall polymerizer (which is the same as polymerizer<br>
10 of Fig. 5 except that guides 5 were removed so that<br>
the prepolymer was caused to fall freely from the holes<br>
of perforated plate 3), thereby obtaining a poly-<br>
trimethylene terephthalate resin (the conditions em-<br>
ployed in this Example are indicated in Tables 1 and 4).<br>
The free-fall polymerizer was operated at 260 Â° C under<br>
a pressure of 100 Pa. The results are shown in Table 1<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
Example 17<br>
Polymerization was performed in substantially the<br>
same manner as in Example 9, except that the second<br>
vertical agitation type polymerizer was replaced by a<br>
thin film type polymerizer (which is the same as poly-<br>
merizer 10 of Fig. 5 except that the perforated plate<br>
had 4 holes arranged, in a line, and that a flat board<br>
is vertically provided as guide 5, so that prepolymer A<br>
is allowed to fall in the form of a film on the flat<br>
board), thereby obtaining a polytrimethylene terephtha-<br>
late resin (the conditions employed in this Example are<br>
indicated in Tables 1 and 4). The thin film type poly-<br>
merizer was operated at 260 Â° C under a pressure of 100<br>
Pa. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Prepolymer A which was fed into the final polymer-<br>
izer 10 satisfied the requirements of the present in-<br>
vention, and the obtained PTT resin B had a high mo-<br>
lecular weight, a narrow molecular weight distribution,<br>
a low terminal carboxyl group content, and excellent<br>
color. Further, the degree of discoloration of the ob-<br>
tained resin occurring by heating was very small.<br>
