Field of invention :<br>
The present invention relates to improved processes for the preparation of p-polymorphic form of Imatinib mesylate. The invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of p~form of Imatinib mesylate . which has the formula given below<br>
The invention also provides a novel, stable cx2-form of Imatinib mesylate and a process for its preparation<br>
This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel stable (X2 form of Imatinib mesylate useful in the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia p-form of Imatinib mesylate . which has the formula given below (CML).<br><br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Imatinib mesylate which is N-{5-[4-(4-methylpiperazino-methyl)- benzoylamido]-2-methylphenyl}-4- (3-pyridyl) 2-pyrimidine -amine, having the formula given above is approved under the trademark "Gleevec ®" by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia before and after the failure of interferon alpha. It has also been approved for the treatment of patients with kit (CD117) positive unresectable and / or metastatic malignant Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs). Recently   it has been approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with<br><br>
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)^ chronic phase. It is known that Imatinib mesylate exists in two polymorphic forms a and p (WO 99/03854).<br>
The preparation of Imatinib mesylate a and (5 forms are disclosed in WO99/03854 issued on 28th January 1999. In the Examples 1 to 3 of the said patent the process for the preparation of Imatinib mesylate p-form has been described using a maximum of 50 gms Imatinib base in solution.<br>
In the Example-2 of the said patent a process has been described for the preparation of the P-form which involves suspending Imatinib base in methanol, adding methane sulfonic acid in methanol, heating to 50°C, followed by carbon treatment and distilling off methanol. Then dissolving the residue in minimum methanol and inoculation by some seeding crystals of Imatinib mesylate P-form.<br>
In Examples land 3 of the said patent, two processes are described for the conversion of a-polymorphic form to P-polymorphic form.<br>
The first process (Example-1) involves<br>
(i)        Digesting a-modification with methanol solvent at 25°C for 2 days. The second process (Example-3) involves<br>
(i)        Heating a modification in methanol to 60°C and inoculating with p- modification.<br>
In the same Example-1, the a-crystal form is prepared as follows:<br>
Imatinib base was suspended in ethanol, methane sulfonic acid was added and heated under reflux for 20 minutes and then filtered at 65°C. The filtrate was evaporated down to 50% and the residue filtered off at 25°C (filter material A). The mother liquor was evaporated to dryness.   The residue and filter material   A were suspended in ethanol<br><br>
dissolved under reflux with addition of water. Cooling overnight to 25°C, filtration and drying yielded Imatinib mesylate a-crystal form.<br>
These processes suffers from the following disadvantages<br>
1.	In Examples 2 and 3 seed crystals of p-form are required to crystallize out the product<br>
2.	The process for preparing a-crystal form given under Example-1 is not reproducible. Repetition of the experiment exactly under identical conditions as reported in the above patent (WO 99/03854) resulted only in the p-form<br>
3.	Thus, there is currently no available process to prepare the a-crystal modification.<br>
Important solid state properties of a pharmaceutical substance are its rate of dissolution in aqueous fluid. The rate of dissolution of an active ingredient in a patients stomach fluid may have therapeutic consequences because it imposes an upper limit on the rate at which an orally-administered active ingredient may reach the blood stream. The solid state form of a compound may also affect its behavior on compaction and its storage stability.<br>
These practical physical characteristics are influenced by the conformation and orientation of molecules in the unit cell, which defines a particular polymorph form of a substance. The polymorphic form may give rise to thermal behavior different form that of the amorphous material (or) another polymorphic form.<br>
Thermal behaviour is measured in the laboratory by such techniques as capillary melting point, Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and may be used to distinguish some polymorphic forms from others. A particular polymorphic form may also give rise to distinct properties that may be detectable by powder x-ray diffraction (XRPD) solid state ,3CNMR spectrometry and infrared spectrometry.<br><br>
The various characteristics and properties of the polymorpohic forms of a substance, e.g. shape, colour, density and the like, will make one polymorphic form preferable over the others for production and /or pharmaceutical compounding. As a result, a very first step in the processes of product development of a new pharmaceutical agent is the determination of whether it exists in polymorphic forms and if so which of such form possesses advantages for the eventual commercial pharmaceutical application. In the case of Imatinib mesylate, p form is offered commercially under the trade name Gleevec ®./Glivec®<br>
In the patent mentioned above (WO 99/03854), p-form was selected over a-form based<br>
on the following observations and conclusions.<br>
(i)        p-form is thermodynamically   stable   at room temperature and at temperatures<br>
below    140°C.   Greater stability of the p-form is thus expected, (ii)       p-crystal form is less hygroscopic than the a-crystal form, (iii)      a-crystal form is meta stable at room temperature (iv)      p-crystal has the advantage that its flow properties are substantially more<br>
favourable than those of that the a-crystal form.<br>
Based on the above information, we undertook a detailed study of the solid state physical properties of the polymorphic forms of Imatinib mesylate. The presumption was that these properties may be influenced by controlling the conditions under which Imatinib mesylate is obtained in solid form. Our studies on a and p-crystal forms of Imatinib Mesylate, surprisingly we could prepare a novel stable -form of Imayininb Mesylate which is also as good as the p-form for commercial pharmaceutical applications. We have designated this new form as a2 polymorphic form.<br>
Based on the above findings the need for a thorough investigation on a -form of Imatinib Mesylate was felt, as the prior art on this polymorphic form, is either inadequate or erroneously documented.<br><br>
Accordingly we focused our R&amp;D efforts in taking up an elaborate study on the polymorphism of Imatinib Mesylate with particular reference to a -form. Surprisingly, these studies also resulted in developing an improved process for the preparation of P-crystal form as well.<br>
The focused R&amp;D program undertaken revealed that:<br>
(i)        the new ot2 form is not meta stable and is stable at room temperature and even at higher temperatures like 120°C.<br>
(ii)      0&amp;2 form is stable at normal and accelerated stress conditions both in bulk and formulated capsule form.<br>
(iii)     ot2 form is as freely soluble in water as is the P-form. The rate of dissolution of ot2 form in the formulation is comparable and even better than that of the P-form.<br>
(iv) Flow properties of   the formulations prepared with the new ot2 are  comparable with that of p form as the same excipient composition is employed in both cases.<br>
Determination of presence of Imatinib mesylate form-p in Imatinib mesylate form ai may be made by analysis for the presence of various peaks associated with form-p particularly at 9.7, 13.9, 18.2, 20.0, 20.6, 21.1, 22.1, 22.7, 23.8, 29.8, 30.8 ± 0.2 degree 26.(WO99/03854).<br>
Therefore we focussed our R&amp;D efforts in taking up an elaborate study on the polymorphism of Imatinib Mesylate with particular reference to stable forms..<br>
Such a stable ct2 form of imatinib Mesylate is not hitherto known and is a novel<br>
polymorphic form. Our copending application No.    A	describes and claims the<br>
novel, stable form and deals with the on form of imatinib Mesylate and a pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition containing the novel ot2 form Imatinib Mesylate which is stable and less hygroscopic and water soluble and having the XRPD characteristics shown in Table 1.<br><br>
In addition, the form prepared by us now is also suitable for developing a pharmaceutical composition. Such a pharmaceutical composition containing ct2 form is also not known and is novel is the subject matter of our above mentioned co pending application no A..<br><br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Beta form of Imatinib Mesylate<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel az crystalline form oi Imatinib Mesylate which is stable at room temperature and even at higher temperatures like 120°C and accelerated stress conditions, freely soluble in water and having tfa characteristics given in Table 1 given below<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel ot2 form of Imatinib Mesylate which is stable and less hygroscopic and water soluble having the characteristics given in table 1<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia which comprises novel (X2 form of Imatinib Mesylate which is stable and less hygroscopic and water soluble having the characteristics given in table 1 and a commonly employed pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention there is provided an improved process for the preparation of Imatinib mesylate form-p which comprises suspending Imatinib base in a solvent selected from methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, mixture of methanol and isopropanol and mixture of isopropanol and water and adding methane sulfonic acid to the resulting solution at room temperature and maintaining the solution at the reflux temperature of the solvent (or) at room temperature and filtering the p-crystal form.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provide a novel (X2 crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate which is stable at room temperature and even at higher temperatures like 120°C and accelerated stress conditions, freely soluble in water and having the characteristics given in Table 1 .<br><br>
According to still another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation novel α2 crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate which is stable at room temperature and even at higher temperatures like 120°C and accelerated stress conditions, freely soluble in water and having the characteristics given in Table 1 which comprises suspending Imatinib base in isopropanol and adding methane sulfonic acid at room temperature and maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature in the range of 40-80°C, for a period in the range of 20-30 minutes, cooling and filtering to obtain the α2 crystal form.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment of Lukemia which comprises novel ot2 form of Imatinib Mesylate which is stable and less hygroscopic and water soluble having the characteristics given in table 1 and a commonly employed pharmaceutically acceptable exepients<br>
It is to be noted that the ot2 form of Imatinib mesylate of the present invention does not substantially convert over time to form p, either as such in bulk form or after formulation in the dosage form, upon storage at about 40° and about 75% relative humidity for at least about 6 months.<br>
We have also observed that the pharmaceutical formulation, particularly oral dosage forms such as capsules containing fine crystals of novel Imatinib mesylate form α2 along with other usually employed pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The dosage form of the formulation of the present invention may be a capsule containing the composition preferably a powdered on granulated solid composition of the invention, within either a hard (or) soft shell. The shell may be made from gelatine and optionally contain a plasticizer such as glycerin and sorbitol and an opacifying agent (or) colorant.<br><br>
Storage of capsule containing highly pure Imatinib mesylate form α2 at about 40° C and about 75% relative humidity for about 3-4 months, does not show any significant conversion to p-polymorphic form of Imatinib mesylate preferably less than about 5%. The detection of Imatinib mesylate form-p in a pharmaceutical formulation to the extent about 1% w/w or more may be accomplished by use of x-ray powder diffraction.<br>
Pharmaceutical composition contains the new α2 form Imatinib mesylate as the active ingredient and one or more excipients conventionally used in such compositions. Excipients are added to the composition for a variety of purposes. Methods known in the art, may be used to prepare the composition. Accordingly the composition may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a combination of excipients including micro crystalline cellulose, lactose, crospovidone XL, colloidal silicon dioxide magnesium stearate and talc.<br>
Table-2 shows suitable ranges of active ingredients and excipients (weight %) and the preferred amounts for the present pharmaceutical formulations. Same ranges of active ingredients and excipients (weight %) is applicable for P-crystal pharmaceutical formulations as well.<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical formulations are useful in the treatment of Chroma ITVW*V&amp;W»VM» Leukemia. The oral pharmaceutical dosage forms of the present invention preferably contain about 100 mg of the base equivalent.<br>
The industrial sized batch of novel Imatinib mesylate form-α2 does not substantially convert over time to form p, either as such in bulk form or after formulation in the dosage form, upon storage at about 40° and about 75% relative humidity for at least about 6 months.<br>

Inference : The release profile and dissolution data show that the capsule formulation with α2 -form is better than the formulation with p-form<br>
Storage of capsule containing pure Imatinib mesylate α2 form prepared by the process of the present invention at about 40° C and about 75% relative humidity for 6 months.<br><br>
does not show any significant conversion to p-polymorphic form of Imatinib mesylate preferably less than about 5%. The detection of Imatinib mesylate form-p in a pharmaceutical formulation to the extent about 1% w/w or more may be accomplished by use of x-ray powder diffraction.<br>
