This invention relates to a/Banier Detection Device to produce uniform denier of raw silk yarn reeled in a Reeling Machine.<br>
In the present system of reeling, production of uniform denier silk depends largely on the skill of the reeler.<br>
The main disadvantage of the present system is that there is variation in fiiament denier within the cocoon as also between cocoons. This produces variation in denier of raw silk beyond acceptable limit.<br>
Another disadvantage of the present system is that the reeier is to feed cocoons to maintain a uniform denier.<br>
The skill of the reeler is limited and has a tendency to feed cocoons whether required or not which leads always to a coarser denier and fails to produce a gradable quality of raw silk.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple, effective Denier detection device which provides the reeler to monitor the denier of the raw silk being reeled through a monitoring means and take quick corrective measures.<br>
Another abject of the present invention is to provide a Denier detection device which reduces the stress and thereby less fatigue on the part of the reeler to intently watch the number of cocoons being reeled.<br><br>
The device thus improves quality and productivity.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device which improves the standard size deviation and maximum size deviation and evenness of raw silk to the international standards.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a denier device which is inexpensive and can be titled into an existing reeling machine, both in cottage basin and multi and reeling machine.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a denier detection device to produce an uniform denier of raw silk yarn reeled in a reeling machine having a denier detector with a mounting means being provided within the path of the coissure and an idle pulley for carrying the thread to the tension pulley through a denier detector of the detecting device, the denier detecting device comprising in an assembly a denier indicator consisting of an indicating plate with a front and back metal pin, the indicating plate being connected to a bolt through a balancing plate, a pair of left hand and right hand denier sensing plates, the left hand sensing plate being attached to the indicating plate through a washer and the right hand sensing plate being attached with the left hand sensing plate via a thickness maintaining spacer which is attached to a nut through a washer, the said denier detector is adapted in the mounting means having a mounting bracket in which the denier detector is placed in a metal insert fixed on the mounting bracket, one end of a balance weight chain being connected to a balance lever the other end of the chain being connected to a denier adjustment apparatus, a sensor placed inside the said bracket, the sensor being connected to an indicating lamp and generating infrared beam which turn on or off indicating lamp depending on non matching of denier of raw silk being reeled with a set denier or matching of the denier of reeled silk thread with the set denier respectively when the sensing plates in contact with the reeled silk thread hold the indicating plate titled downwards or upright.<br><br>
means having a mounting bracket in which the denier detector is placed in a metal insert fixed on the mounting bracket, one end of a balance weight chain being connected to a balance lever the other end of the chain being connected to a denier adjustment apparatus,a sensor placed inside the said bracket, the sensor being connected to an indicating lamp and generating infrared beam which turn on or off the indicating lamp depending on non matching of denier of raw silk being reeled with the set denier or matching of the denier of reeled silk thread with the set denier respectively when the sensing plates in contact with the reeled silk thread hold the indicating plate tilted downward or upright.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings:<br>

Figure 6       -        represents power supply arrangement for infrared sensor<br>
and indicating lamp through stepdown transformer<br>
Figures 7 &amp; 8	represent USTER diagram of multivoitine raw silk reeled with and<br>
without CSTRI denier detector in which the abscissae represents the length of the sample yarn taken for testing and the ordinate represents the percentage of denier variation from the mean denier.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a denier detector device can be easily fitted onto a reeling machine without disturbing the preset prior arrangement for silk thread production. Such arrangements and present layout of the reeling machine with detecting device is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The cocoons (2) are being boiled in the basin (1) and the multiple threads are passed onto the jette boute (3), from thereto the bottom (4) to a croissure (5) and croissure Pulley (6). There is a tension pulley (7) before the silk threads passes through the denier detector (8).<br>
There is a denier indicating lamp (9) and the threads are winded on the reel (11) via a thread guide (10).<br>
The denier detector mounting means as in Figure 2 shows a balancing lever (12) metal insert (13), balance weight chain (14) a simultaneous denier adjustment apparatus (15), a mounting bracket (16) and an infrared sensor (17). The denier detector is placed in the metal insert (13) fixed inside a mounting bracket (16) in which balancing lever and infrared sensor are also placed.<br><br>
The denier detector of Figure 3 comprises a denier indicating plate (19) with a front and back metal pin (21 &amp; 22). The indicating plate is connected to a bolt (18) through a balancing plate (19). There is a pair of left hand and right hand denier sensing plates (24 &amp;26).<br>
The L/H sensing plate (24) is attached with the indicating plate (20) through a plastic washer (23). The R/H sensing plate (26) is attached with the L/H sensing plate via a thickness maintaining spacer (25) which is attached to a nut (29) through a plastic washer (27) and washer (28). The assembled parts of the denier detector is shown separately in Fig. 3.<br>
The denier detecting device consists of the following parts:<br>
1.	Denier detector w ith mounting bracket.<br>
2.	Infrared sensor with indicating lamp.<br>
3.	6 to 9 volts output AC to DC transformer for sensor and indicating lamp power supply.<br>
4.	Simultaneous denier adjustment apparatus.<br>
The denier detecting unit (8) operates on friction principle. The raw silk thread passing through the friction plates (24,26) causes frictional force that positions the plate (20). When the denier of the raw silk being reeled is equal to the set denier, the frictional resistance caused due to its contact with the sensing plates (24,26) would hold the Denier Indicating plate (20) upright as the sensing plates (24,26) and the denier indicating plate (20) are fixed together. However, if the denier becomes finer, the plate<br><br>
(20) tilts downward due to the variation in the frictionai resistance. In this position the metal pin (21) attached to the denier indicating plate comes in the way of infrared beam emitted from the sensor (17) and cuts the beam. This inturn glows the indicator lamp (9) and emits a beep sound, which draws the attention of the reeler to cast a cocoon. This casting of a fresh cocoon thread would increase the raw silk denier. When the corrected raw silk denier matches the set denier, the frictionai resistance moves ttie denier indicating plate (20) to the upright position thereby turning off the indicator lamp (9).<br>
Denier detector (8) consists of two parallel sensing plates (24,26) of ground glass with a thickness maintaining spacer (25) in between, which has a thickness corresponding to the target denier of raw silk. A denier indicating plate [(crank) (20)] with a definite length and weight is attached such that balancing of unit is performed for a particular denier of yarn. Brass balancing plate (19) is used to balance the denier detector. The movement of indicating plate (20) in downward and upward direction will vary with the variation in denier of raw silk. This movement of the denier indicating pfate (20) as per the denier of raw silk has been utilized to give light signal to the reeler with the help of infrared sensor (17) and indicating lamp (9). Bolt (18), washers (23,27,28) and nut (29) are the parts of the detector used to fix together the brass balancing plate (19), denier indicating plate (20), sensing plates (24,26), thickness maintaining spacer (25) in between sensing plates properly and balancing of the detector unit is performed for a particular denier of the yarn. Denier detecting unit (8) works on the friction principle. But friction between raw silk and the denier detector will be affected by cocoon characteristics (like distribution of cocoon yarn denier, denier of cocoon yarn etc), cocoon cooking conditions, reeling speed, temperature of reeling water, ambient temperature and humidity etc. and hence affecting the targeted average denier of raw-silk even though same denier detector is used. In<br><br>
such a situation by using simultaneous denier adjustment apparatus (see Fig,4) adjustment of the friction between detector and raw silk is made by adjusting the balance weight chain length (14) attached to balancing lever (12) In order to meet the targeted average denier. Simultaneous denier adjustment apparatus consists of a central shaft<br>
(30)	which runs throughout the length of the machine. On this shaft one worm wheel<br>
(31)	is mounted behind each reeling end of the reeling machine/ On this worm wheel (31), denier detector balancing weight chain (14) is mounted and other end of the chain is connected to balancing lever (12) placed in the denier detector mounting bracket (16). To the left hand side of the reeling machine on the centra! shaft (30), denier- regulating dial is mounted. Adjustment of the balance weight chain (14) will be made by turning the balancing weight chain adjustment handle (33) on denier regulator dial so that all the denier detectors on one side of the reeling machine will be adjusted simultaneously in a synchronized manner. In other words the simultaneous denier adjustment apparatus is a synchronizer of the whole operations of the detecting device along with the control circuit of the sensor and indicating lamp.<br>
The test results of the raw silk reeled with and without denier detecting device are given in Tables 1 &amp; 2. It could be seen from the table that the size deviation, maximum size deviation and evenness characteristics of raw silk reeled with the CSTRI denier detecting device are of superior grade than raw silk reeled without denier detecting device as used in pior art knowledge. From the USTER diagrams (Figs. 7 &amp; 8), it could be observed that the denier detecting device helps to a great extent in controlling the short term deviations and hence producing superior grade raw silk.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
