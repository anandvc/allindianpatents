				<td>BENZOIMIDAZOL-2-YL pyridinES AS MODULATORS OF<br>
THE HISTAMINE H, RECEPTOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain benzoimidazol-2-yl pyridines,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of using them for the<br>
treatment of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by histamine H4<br>
receptor activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is the most recently identified receptor for<br>
histamine (for reviews, see: Fung-Leung, W.-P., et al., Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs<br>
2004, 5(11), 1174-1183; de Esch, I.J.P., et al.. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005,<br>
26(9), 462-469). The receptor is found in the bone marrow and spleen and is<br>
expressed on eosinophils, basophils, mast cells (Liu, C, et al., Mol. Pharmacol.<br>
2001, 59(3), 420-426; Morse, K.L., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 296(3),<br>
1058-1066; Hofstra, C.L., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305(3), 1212-<br>
1221; Lippert, U., et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004,123(1), 116-123; Voehringer,<br>
D., et al., Immunity 2004,20(3), 267-277), CD8+ T cells (Gantner, F., et al., J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002, 303(1), 300-307), dendritic cells, and human<br>
synovial ceils from rheumatoid arthritis patients (Ikawa, Y., et al., Biol. Pharm.<br>
Bull. 2005, 28(10), 2016-2018). However, expression in neutrophils and<br>
monocytes is less well defined (Ling, P., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004, 142(1),<br>
161-171). Receptor expression is at least in part controlled by various<br>
inflammatory stimuli (Coge, F., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001,<br>
284(2), 301-309; Morse, et al., 2001), thus supporting that H4 receptor activation<br>
influences inflammatory responses. Because of its preferential expression on<br>
immunocompetent cells, the H4 receptor is closely related with the regulatory<br>
functions of histamine during the immune response.<br>
A biological activity of histamine in the context of immunology and<br>
autoimmune diseases is closely related with the allergic response and its<br>
deleterious effects, such as inflammation. Events that elicit the inflammatory<br><br>
response include physical stimulation (including trauma), chemical stimulation,<br>
infection, and invasion by a foreign body. The inflammatory response is<br>
characterized by pain, increased temperature, redness, swelling, reduced<br>
function, or a combination of these.<br>
Mast cell degranulation (exocytosis) releases histamine and leads to an<br>
inflammatory response that may be Initially characterized by a histamine-<br>
modulated wheal and flare reaction. A wide variety of immunological stimuli (e.g.,<br>
allergens or antibodies) and non-immunological (e.g., chemical) stimuli may<br>
cause the activation, recruitment, and de-granulation of mast cells. Mast cell<br>
activation initiates allergic inflammatory responses, which in turn cause the<br>
recruitment of other effector cells that further contribute to the inflammatory<br>
response. It has been shown that histamine induces chemotaxis of mouse mast<br>
cells (Hofstra, et al., 2003). Chemotaxis does not occur using mast cells derived<br>
from H4 receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, the response is blocked by an H4-<br>
specific antagonist, but not by H1, H2 or H3 receptor antagonists (Hofstra, et al.,<br>
2003; Thurmond, R.L., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004, 309(1), 404-413).<br>
The in vivo migration of mast cells to histamine has also been investigated and<br>
shown to be H4 receptor dependent (Thurmond, et al., 2004). The migration of<br>
mast cells may play a role in allergic rhinitis and allergy where increases in mast<br>
cell number are found (Kirby, J.G., et al., An. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1987,136(2),<br>
379-383; Crimi, E., et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991, 144(6), 1282-1286; Amin,<br>
K., et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000,162(6), 2295-2301; Gauvreau, G.M.,<br>
et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000,161(5), 1473-1478; Kassel, O., et al.,<br>
Clin. Exp. Allergy 2001, 31(9), 1432-1440). In addition, it is known that in<br>
response to allergens there is a redistribution of mast cells to the epithelial lining<br>
of the nasal mucosa (Fokkens, W.J., et al., Clin. Exp. Allergy 1992, 22(7), 701-<br>
710; Slater, A., et al., J. Laryngol. Otol. 1996,110, 929-933). These results show<br>
that the chemotactic response of mast cells; is mediated by histamine H4<br>
receptors.<br>
It has been shown that eosinophils can chemotax towards histamine<br>
(O'Reilly, M., et al., J: Recept. Signal Transduction 2002, 22(1-4), 431-448;<br>
Buckland, K.F., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003,140(6), 1117-1127; Ling et al.,<br><br>
2004). Using H4 selective ligands, it has been shown that histamine-induced<br>
chemotaxis of eosinophils is mediated through the H4 receptor (Buckland, et al.,<br>
2003; Ling et al., 2004). Cell surface expression of adhesion molecules<br>
CD11b/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD54 (ICAM-1) on eosinophils increases after<br>
histamine treatment (Ling, et al., 2004). This increase is blocked by H4 receptor<br>
antagonists but not by H-t, H2, or H3 receptor antagonists.<br>
The H4R also plays a role in dendritic: cells and T cells. In human<br>
monocyte-derived dendritic cells, H4R stimulation suppresses IL-12p70 production<br>
and drives histamine-mediated chemotaxis (Gutzmer, R., et al., J. Immunol. 2005,<br>
174(9), 5224-5232). A role for the H4 receptor in CD8* T cells has also been<br>
reported. Gantner, et al., (2002) showed that both H4 and H2 receptors control<br>
histamine-induced IL-16 release from human CD8+ T cells. IL-16 is found in the<br>
bronchoatveolar fluid of allergen- or histamine-chailenged asthmatics (Mashikian,<br>
V.M., et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998, 101 (6, Part 1), 786-792; Krug, N., et<br>
al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000,162(1), 105-111) and is considered<br>
important in CD4+ cell migration. The activity of the receptor in these cell types<br>
indicates an important role in adaptive immune responses such as those active in<br>
autoimmune diseases.<br>
In vivo H4 receptor antagonists were able to block neutrophilia in zymosan-<br>
induced peritonitis or pleurisy models (Takeshita, K., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp.<br>
Ther. 2003, 307(3), 1072-1078; Thurmond, et al., 2004). In addition, H4 receptor<br>
antagonists have activity in a widely used and well-characterized model of colitis<br>
(Varga, C, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005, 522(1-3), 130-138). These results<br>
support the conclusion that H4 receptor antagonists have the capacity to be anti-<br>
inflammatory in vivo.<br>
Another physiological rote of histamine is as a mediator of itch and H1<br>
receptor antagonists are not completely effective in the clinic. Recently, the H4<br>
receptor has also been implicated in histamine-induced scratching in mice (Bell,<br>
J.K., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004, 142(2), 374-380). The effects of histamine<br>
could be blocked by H4 antagonists. These results support the hypothesis that<br>
the H4 receptor is involved in histamine-induced itch and that H4 receptor<br>
antagonists will therefore have positive effects in treating pruritis.<br><br>
Modulation of H4 receptors controls the release of inflammatory mediators<br>
and inhibits leukocyte recruitment, thus providing the ability to prevent and/or treat<br>
H4-mediated diseases and conditions, including the deleterious effects of allergic<br>
responses such as inflammation. Compounds according to the present invention<br>
have H4 receptor modulating properties. Compounds according to the present<br>
invention have leukocyte recruitment inhibiting properties. Compounds according<br>
to the present invention have anti-inflammatory properties.<br>

Background and review material on inflammation and conditions related<br>
with inflammation can be found in articles such as the following: Nathan, C,<br>
Nature 2002, 420(6917), 846-852; Tracey, K.J., Nature 2002,420(6917), 853-<br>
859; Coussens, L.M., etal., Nature 2002,420(6917), 860-867; Libby, P., Nature<br>
2002, 420, 868-874; Benoist, C, et al., Nature 2002, 420(6917), 875-878;<br>

420(6917), 885-891; Steinberg, D., Nature Med. 2002, 8(11), 1211-1217.<br>
Thus, small-molecule histamine H4 receptor modulators according to this<br>
invention control the release of inflammatory mediators and inhibit leukocyte<br>
recruitment, and may be useful in treating inflammation of various etiologies,<br>
including the following conditions and diseases: inflammatory disorders, allergic<br>
disorders, dermatological disorders, autoimmune disease, lymphatic disorders,<br>
pruritis, and immunodeficiency disorders. Diseases, disorders and medical<br>
conditions that are mediated by histamine H4 receptor activity include those<br>
referred to herein.<br>
2-Arylbenzimidazoles have been described as histamine H4 receptor<br>
modulators, See: U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2005/0070550A1. However, there still<br><br>
remains a need for potent histamine H4 receptor modulators with desirable<br>
pharmaceutical properties.<br>

Detailed Description of Invention<br>
The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following<br>
description, including the following glossary of terms and the concluding<br>
examples. For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the publications, including<br>
patents, cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
As used herein, the terms "including", "containing" and "comprising" are<br>
used herein in their open, non-limiting sense.<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyi group having<br>

groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein<br>
would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated or partially saturated,<br>
monocyclic, fused polycyclic, or spiro polycyolic carbocycle having from 3 to 12<br>
ring atoms per carbocycle. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include the<br>
following entities, in the form of properly bonded moieties:<br><br><br><br>
A "heterocycloalkyl" refers to a monocyclic, or fused, bridged, or spiro<br>
polycyclic ring structure that is saturated or partially saturated and has from 3 to<br>

sulfur) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per heterocycle. Illustrative examples of<br>
heteroaryl groups include the following entities, in the form of properly bonded<br>
moieties:<br><br><br><br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the species of heteroaryl,<br>
cycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl groups listed or illustrated above are not<br>
exhaustive, and that additional species within the scope of these defined terms<br>
may also be selected.<br>
The term "halogen" represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine, or iodine. The<br>
term "halo" represents chloro, fluoro, bromo, or iodo.<br>
The term "substituted" means that the specified group or moiety bears one<br>
or more substituents. The term "unsubstitu ted" means that the specified group<br>
bears no substituents. The term "optionally substituted" means that the specified<br>
group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the<br>
term "substituted" is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is<br>
meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system.<br>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative<br>
expressions given herein are not qualified with the term "about". It is understood<br>
that, whether the term "about" is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein<br>
is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the<br>
approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and approximations due to the<br>
experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. Whenever a<br>
yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers to a mass of the entity for which<br>
the yield is given with respect to the maximum amount of the same entity that<br>
could be obtained under the particular stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations<br>
that are given as percentages refer to mass ratios, unless indicated differently.<br>
Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having<br>
structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms.<br>
In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric<br>
centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers<br><br>
and stereoisomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures<br>
thereof, are considered within the scope of 1he formula. Thus, any formula given<br>
herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one<br>
or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric Isomers (i.e., cis<br>
and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. Additionally, any formula<br>
given herein is intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such<br>
compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Reference to a chemical entity herein stands for a reference to any one of:<br>
(a) the actually recited form of such chemical entity, and (b) any of the forms of<br>
such chemical entity in the medium in which the compound is being considered<br>
when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-COOH,<br>
encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH
R-COO"(SOi). In this example, R-COOH(S) refers to the solid compound, as it could<br>
be for example in a tablet or some other solid pharmaceutical composition or<br>
preparation; R-COOH(SOi) refers to the undissociated form of the compound in a<br>
solvent; and R-COO"(Sol) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a<br>
solvent, such as the dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous<br>
environment, whether such dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt<br>
thereof, or from any other entity that yields F:-COO upon dissociation in the<br>
medium being considered. In another example, an expression such as "exposing<br>
an entity to compound of formula R-COOH" 'efers to the exposure of such entity<br>
to the form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the<br>
medium in which such exposure takes place In this regard, if such entity is for<br>
example in an aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-<br>
COOH is in such same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to<br>
species such as R-COOH(aq) and/or R-COO(aq), where the subscript "(aq)" stands<br>
for "aqueous" according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and<br>
biochemistry. A carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these<br>
nomenclature examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it<br>
is merely an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be<br><br>
provided in terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl,<br>
basic nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that<br>
interacts or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains<br>
the compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited<br>
to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis,<br>
solvation, including hydration, protonation, and deprotonation. In another<br>
example, a zwitterionic compound is encompassed herein by referring to a<br>
compound that is known to form a zwitterions, even if it is not explicitly named in<br>
its zwitterionic form. Terms such as zwitterion. zwitterions, and their synonyms<br>
zwitterionic compound(s) are standard lUPAC-endorsed names that are well<br>
known and part of standard sets of defined scientific names. In this regard, the<br>
name zwitterion is assigned the name identification CHEBI:27369 by the<br>
Chemical Entities of Biological (nerest (ChEBI) dictionary of molecular entities.<br>
(See, for example its on line version at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/init.do). As<br>
generally well known, a zwitterion or zwitterionic compound is a neutral compound<br>
that has formal unit charges of opposite sign. Sometimes these compounds are<br>
referred to by the term "inner salts". Other sources refer to these compounds as<br>
"dipolar ions", although the latter term is regarded by still other sources as a<br>
misnomer. As a specific example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine)<br>
has the formula H2NCH2COOH, and it exists in some media.(in this case in<br>
neutral media) in the form of the zwitterion +H3NCH2COO". Zwitterions,<br>
zwitterionic compounds, inner salts and dipolar ions in the known and well<br>
established meanings of these terms are within the scope of this invention, as<br>
would in any case be so appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. Because<br>
there is no need to name each and every embodiment that would be recognized<br>
by those of ordinary skill in the art, no structures of the zwitterionic compounds<br>
that are associated with the compounds of this invention are given explicitly<br>
herein. Thery are, however, part of the embodiments of this invention. No further<br>
examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and<br>
transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art.<br><br>
Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as<br>
well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled<br>
compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that<br>
one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or<br>
mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of<br>
the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O,<br>
17O 3ip 32p, 35s 18F 36Cl 125, respectively. Such isotopically labelled<br>
compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with 14C), reaction kinetic<br>
studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques [such as<br>
positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed<br>
tomography (SPECT)] including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in<br>
radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or 11C labeled compound<br>
may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further, substitution<br>
with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic<br>
advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in<br>
vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of<br>
this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the<br>
procedures disclosed in the schemes or in trie examples and preparations<br>
described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for<br>
a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>
When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular<br>
moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to<br>
define the same choice of the species for the variable appearing elsewhere. In<br>
other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species<br>
from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same<br>
variable elsewhere in the formula, unless stated otherwise.<br>

For example, reference to disubstituent -A-B-, where A ^ B, refers herein to such<br>
disubstituent with A attached to a first substituted member and B attached to a<br>
second substituted member, and it also refers to such disubstituent with A<br>
attached to the second substituted member and B attached to the first substituted<br>
member.<br>
According to the foregoing interpretive considerations on assignments and<br>
nomenclature, it is understood that explicit reference herein to a set implies,<br>

The invention includes also pharmaceirtically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds represented by Formula (I) or Formula (II), preferably of those<br>
described above and of the specific compounds exemplified herein.<br><br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean a salt of a free<br>
acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) or Formula (II) that is<br>
non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for<br>
administration to the subject. See, generally, S.M. Berge, et al., "Pharmaceutical<br>
Salts", J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66:1-19, and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts,<br>
Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and yl)CA,<br>
Zurich, 2002. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are<br>
pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients<br>
without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I)<br>
or Formula (II) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group,<br>
or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of<br>
inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates,<br>
monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates,<br>
pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates,<br>
caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates,<br>
oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates,<br>
butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dbates, be izoates, chlorobenzoates,<br>
methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates,<br>
phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates,<br>
phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroybutyrates. glycolates, tartrates,<br>
methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1 -sulfonates, naphthalene-<br>
2-sulfonates, and mandelates.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) contains a basic nitrogen,<br>
the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an<br>
inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic<br>
acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid,<br>
such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid,<br>
valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid,<br><br>
salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidy! acid, such as<br>
glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic<br>
acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic<br>
acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic<br>
acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible<br>
mixture of acids such as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and<br>
mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light<br>
of the ordinary level of skill in this technology.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) is an acid, such as a<br>
carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with<br>
an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary),<br>
an alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth melal hydroxide, any compatible mixture<br>
of bases such as those given as examples herein, and any other base and<br>
mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light<br>
of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable<br>
salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine,<br>
ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and<br>
cyclic amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and<br>
piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium,<br>
magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.<br>
The invention also relates to treatment methods employing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the&gt; compounds of Formula (I) or<br>
Formula (II). The term "prodrug" means a precursor of a designated compound<br>
that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a<br>
chemical or physiological process such as soivolysis or enzymatic cleavage, or<br>
under physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological<br>
pH is converted to the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II)). A<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a prodrug that is not toxic, biologically<br>
intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration to the subject.<br>
Illustrative procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug<br><br>
derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>
Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Examples of prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue,<br>
or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid<br>
residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino,<br>
hydroxy, or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II).<br>
Examples of amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino<br>
acids, commonly designated by three letter symbols, as well as 4-hydroxyproline,<br>
hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-rrethylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine,<br>
gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and<br>
methionine sulfone.<br>
Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free<br>
carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) or Formula (II) as amides or alkyl<br>
esters. Examples of amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C1-6<br>
alkyl amines and secondary di(C1-6alkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5-<br>
or 6-membered heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties. Examples of amides<br>
include those that are derived from ammonia, C1-3alkyl primary amines, and di(C1-2<br>
alkyl)amines. Examples of esters of the invention include C1-7alkyl, C5-7<br>
cycloalkyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C1-6alkyl) esters. Preferred esters include methyl<br>
esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using<br>
groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and<br>
phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in<br>
Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19,115. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and<br>
amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters,<br>
and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Oerivatization of<br>
hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl<br>
group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine,<br>
or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester<br>
as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be<br>
prepared as described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,10. Free amines can also be<br>
derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug<br><br>
moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine, and carboxylic acid<br>
functionalities.<br>
Pharmaceutically active metabolites may also be used in the methods of<br>
the invention. A "pharmaceutically active metabolite" means a pharmacologically<br>
active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula<br>
(II) or salt thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be<br>
determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g.,<br>
Bertolini, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan, et al., J. Pharm. Scl.<br>
1997, 86 (7), 765-767; Bagshawe, Drug Dev. Res. 1995, 34, 220-230; Bodor,<br>
Adv. Drug Res. 1984, 13, 224-331; Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs (Elsevier<br>
Press, 1985); and Larsen, Design and Application of Prodrugs, Drug Design and<br>
Development (Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers,<br>
1991).<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) and their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically<br>
active metabolites (collectively, "agents") of the present invention are useful as<br>
histamine m receptor modulators in the methods of the invention. The agents<br>
may be used in the inventive methods for tie treatment or prevention of medical<br>
conditions, diseases, or disorders mediated through modulation of the histamine<br>
H4 receptor, such as those described herein. Agents according to the invention<br>
may therefore be used as an anti-inflammatory agents. Symptoms or disease<br>
states are intended to be included within the scope of "medical conditions,<br>
disorders, or diseases."<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of using the pharmaceutical<br>
agents described herein to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a<br>
disease, disorder, or condition mediated through histamine H4 receptor activity,<br>
such as inflammation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an agent of the present invention is<br>
administered to treat inflammation. Inflammation may be associated with various<br>
diseases, disorders, or conditions, such as inflammatory disorders, allergic<br>
disorders, dermatological disorders, autoimmune disease, lymphatic disorders,<br>
and immunodeficiency disorders, including the more specific conditions and<br><br>
diseases given below. Regarding the onset and evolution of inflammation,<br>
inflammatory diseases or inflammation-mediated diseases or conditions include,<br>
but are not limited to, acute inflammation, allergic inflammation, and chronic<br>
inflammation.<br>
Illustrative types of inflammation treatable with a histamine H4 receptor-<br>
modulating agent according to the invention include inflammation due to any one<br>
of a plurality of conditions such as allergy, asthma, dry eye, chronic obstructed<br>
pulmonary disease (COPD), atherosclerosis;, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple<br>
sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases (including colitis, Crohn's disease, and<br>
ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, pruritis, itchy skin, atopic dermatitis, urticaria (hives),<br>
ocular inflammation, conjunctivitis, nasat polyps, allergic rhinitis, nasal itch,<br>
scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid diseases, immune-mediated (also known as<br>
type 1) diabetes mellitus and lupus, which are characterized by excessive or<br>
prolonged inflammation at some stage of the disease. Other autoimmune<br>
diseases that lead to inflammation include Myasthenia gravis, autoimmune<br>
neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barre, autoimmune uveitis, autoimmune hemolytic<br>
anemia, pernicious anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, temporal arteritis,<br>
anti-phospholipid syndrome, vasculitides, such as Wegener's granulomatosis,<br>
Behcet's disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligio, primary<br>
biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis,<br>
autoimmune disease of the adrenal gland, polymyositis, dermatomyositis.<br>
spondyloarthropathies, such as ankylosing spondylitis, and Sjogren's syndrome.<br>
Pruritis with a histamine H4 receptor-modulating agent according to the<br>
invention includes that which is a symptom of allergic cutaneous diseases (such<br>
as atopic dermatitis and hives) and other metabolic disorders (such as chronic<br>
renal failure, hepatic cholestasis, and diabetes mellitus).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, an agent of the present invention is<br>
administered to treat allergy, asthma, autoimmune diseases, or pruritis.<br>
The term "treat" or "treating" as used herein is intended to refer to<br>
administration of an agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the<br>
purpose of effecting a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through modulation of<br>
histamine H4 receptor activity. Treating includes reversing, ameliorating,<br><br>
alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, lessening the severity of, or preventing a<br>
disease, disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease,<br>
disorder or condition mediated through modulation of histamine H4 receptor<br>
activity. The term "subject" refers to a mammalian patient in need of such<br>
treatment, such as a human. "Modulators" include both inhibitors and activators,<br>
where "inhibitors" refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate,<br>
desensitize or down-regulate histamine H4 receptor expression or activity, and<br>
"activators'* are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize, or up-<br>
regulate histamine H4 receptor expression or activity.<br>
In treatment methods according to the invention, an effective amount of at<br>
least one pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a<br>
subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder, or<br>
condition. An "effective amount" means an amount or dose sufficient to generally<br>
bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of<br>
such treatment for the designated disease, disorder, or condition. Effective<br>
amounts or doses of the agents of the present invention may be ascertained by<br>
routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and<br>
by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of<br>
administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the severity<br>
and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or<br>
ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the<br>
judgment of the treating physician. An illustrative dose is in the range of from<br>
about 0.001 to about 200 mg of agent per kg of subject's body weight per day,<br>
preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or<br>
divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative<br>
range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about<br>
0.2 to about 2.5 g/day.<br>
Once improvement of the patient's disease, disorder, or condition has<br>
occurred, the dose may be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment.<br>
For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be<br>
reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic<br><br>
or prophylactic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated<br>
to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require<br>
Intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.<br>
In addition, the agents of the invention may be used in combination with<br>
additional active compounds in the treatment of the above conditions. The<br>
additional compounds may be coadministered separately with an agent of<br>
Formula (I) or Formula (II) or included with such an agent as an additional active<br>
ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an<br>
illustrative embodiment, additional active compounds are those that are known or<br>
discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases<br>
mediated by histamine H4 receptor activity, such as another histamine H4 receptor<br>
modulator or a compound active against another target associated with the<br>
particular condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase<br>
efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the<br>
potency or effectiveness of an agent according to the invention), decrease one or<br>
more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the agent according to the<br>
invention.<br>
When referring to modulating the target receptor, an "effective amount"<br>
means an amount sufficient to affect the activity of such receptor. Measuring the<br>
activity of the target receptor may be performed by routine analytical methods.<br>
Target receptor modulation is useful in a variety of settings, including assays.<br>
The agents of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or<br>
more other active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an<br>
effective amount of at least one pharmaceutical agent in accordance with the<br>
invention; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" refers to a substance that is not<br>
toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration<br>
to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition<br>
or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a<br>
pharmaceutical agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients<br><br>
include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of<br>
starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more<br>
dosage units of the pharmaceutical agents may be prepared using suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become<br>
available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the<br>
inventive methods by a suitable route of delivery, e.g., oral, parenteral, rectal,<br>
topical, or ocular routes, or by inhalation.<br>
The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees,<br>
powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or<br>
suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous<br>
infusion, topical administration, or oral administration.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in<br>
the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To<br>
prepare the oral compositions, the agents may be formulated to yield a dosage of,<br>
e.g., from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 20<br>
mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 rig/kg daily.<br>
Oral tablets may include the agent and any other active ingredients mixed<br>
with compatible pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as diluents,<br>
disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents,<br>
flavoring agents, coloring agents and preseivative agents. Suitable inert fillers<br>
include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose,<br>
starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol,<br>
and the like. Examples of liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water,<br>
and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (F'VP), sodium starch glycolate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are examples of disintegrating agents.<br>
Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present,<br>
may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be<br>
coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to<br>
delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric<br>
coating.<br><br>
Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To<br>
prepare hard gelatin capsules, active ingredient may be mixed with a solid, semi-<br>
solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the active<br>
ingredient with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a<br>
mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol<br>
400, or propylene glycol.<br>
Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions,<br>
solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry<br>
product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such<br>
liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose,<br>
sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethyicellulose, carboxymethyicellulose, aluminum<br>
stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil<br>
or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water; preservatives<br>
(for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents<br>
such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.<br>
The active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral<br>
routes. For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal<br>
administration as a suppository. For parente rai use, including intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the agents of the invention<br>
may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an<br>
appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous<br>
vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms may<br>
be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices,<br>
in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be<br>
withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentraVe that can be used to prepare an<br>
injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses range from about 1 to 1000<br>
ng/kg/minute of agent, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period<br>
ranging from several minutes to several days.<br>
For topical administration, the agents may be mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another<br><br>
mode of administering the agents of the invention may utilize a patch formulation<br>
to affect transdermal delivery.<br>
Agents may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by<br>
inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing<br>
a suitable carrier.<br>
Examples of agents useful in methods of the invention will now be<br>
described by reference to illustrative synthetic schemes for their general<br>
preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize<br>
that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably<br>
selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the<br>
reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired<br>
product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of<br>
the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through<br>
the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to<br>
Formula (I) or Formula (II).<br>
In the Schemes depicted below, one skilled in the art will recognize that R11<br>
may be replaced with a suitable nitrogen protecting group, such as a tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl group (Boc), and that protecting group replaced at a later stage in<br>
the synthesis.<br><br>
Referring to Scheme A, amines A2 are commercially available or are<br>
prepared from acids A1 or alcohols A3. Coupling of acids A1 with amines R6NH2,<br><br>
in the presence of activating agents such as dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide,<br>
EDC/HOBt, or carbonyl diimidazole, in a solvent such as DMF or THF, provides<br>
the corresponding amides (not shown). Alternatively, acids A1 are activated to<br>
their corresponding acid chlorides and reacted with amines R6NH2 in the<br>
presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine or diisopropyiethylamine, in a<br>
solvent such as DCM or THF. The resulting amides are reduced to amines A2 by<br>
a suitable reducing agent such as LiAIH4, in a solvent such as THF. Alcohols A3<br>
are activated using general methods to form, for example, alkyl halides or alkyl<br>
tosylates. Displacement with R6NH2 in the presence of a suitable base such as<br>
NaH, NaOH, triethylamine, or diisopropyiethylamine, in a solvent such as DCM or<br>
THF, provides amines A2. Alternatively, amines A2 are prepared from alcohols<br>
A3 by reaction with phthalimide or a suitable amino surrogate under Mitsunobu<br>
conditions. Where phthalimide is used, the free amine is revealed through<br>
treatment with hydrazine.<br><br>
Referring to Scheme B, amines A2 are allowed to react with pyridines B1,<br>
which are commercially available or which are produced using general methods,<br>
in a solvent such as pyridine, DMF, MeOH, or EtOH, or a mixture thereof, at<br>
temperatures between about room temperature and the reflux temperature of the<br>
solvent, or in a sealed tube at temperatures up to about 120 °C. 2-<br>
Aminopyridines B2 are converted to aldehydes B3 by reduction of the Y<br>
substituent with a suitable reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminum hydride.<br><br>
Where Y is an ester group, reduction produces aldehydes B3 or the<br>
corresponding alcohols (not shown). Where an alcohol is produced, oxidation<br>
using a suitable oxidizing agent such as Mn02, Dess-Martin periodinane, or<br>
Swern conditions, provides aldehydes B3. Condensation of aldehydes B3 with<br>
suitably substituted diamines B4, in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as<br>
NaH2S2O5, in a solvent such as DMF, MeOH, or EtOH, or a mixture thereof, at<br>
temperatures between about room temperature and the reflux temperature of the<br>
solvent, produces compounds of Formula (I) where each of R7 is H.<br><br>
Referring to Scheme C, acids A1 or alcohols A3 may be coupled with 2-<br>
aminopyridines C1 using the methods described in Scheme A to form amides and<br>
amines C2. Compounds C2 are processed as described in Scheme B to provide<br>
compounds of Formula (I).<br>
Compounds of Formula (II) are prepared using methods analogous to<br>
those depicted for compounds of Formula (I), with the exception that pyridines B1<br>
are replaced by the N-oxo analog, 2-chloro-1 -oxy-isonicotinonitrile.<br>
Additional synthetic methods are described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ.<br>
2005/0070550A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Compounds prepared according to the schemes described above may be<br>
obtained as single enantiomers, diastereomers, or regioisomers, or as racemic<br>
mixtures or mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomers, or regioisomers. Where<br>
regioisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures are obtained, isomers may be separated<br>
using conventional methods such as chromatography or crystallization. Where<br>
racemic (1:1) and non-racemic (not 1:1) mixtures of enantiomers are obtained,<br><br>
single enantiomers may be isolated using conventional separation methods<br>
known to one skilled in the art. Particularly useful separation methods may<br>
include chiral chromatography, recrystallization, diastereomeric salt formation, or<br>
derivatization into diastereomeric adducts followed by separation.<br>
The following examples are provided to further illustrate aspects of the<br>
invention and various preferred embodiments.<br>

Biological Testing:<br>
Binding Assay on Recombinant Human Histamine H4 Receptor<br>
SK-N-MC cells or COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pH4R and<br>
grown in 150 cm2 tissue culture dishes. Cells were washed with saline solution,<br>
scraped with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min).<br>
Cell membranes were prepared by homogenization of the cell pellet in 20 mM<br>
Tris-HCI with a polytron tissue homogenizer for 10 sec at high speed.<br>
Homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant<br>
was then collected and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C. The final<br>
pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCI. Cell membranes were incubated with<br>
3<br>
H-histamine (5-70 nM) in the presence or absence of excess histamine (10,000<br>
nM). Incubation occurred at room temperature for 45 min. Membranes were<br>
harvested by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C filters and washed 4 times with<br>
ice-cold 50 mM Tris HCI. Filters were then dried, mixed with scintillant and<br>
counted for radioactivity. SK-N-MC or COS/' cells expressing human histamine<br>
H4 receptor were used to measure the affinity of binding of other compounds and<br>
3<br>
their ability to displace H-ligand binding by incubating the above-described<br>
reaction in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor or compound to be<br><br>
tested. For competition binding studies using 3H-histamine, K1 values were<br>
calculated, based on an experimentally determined KD value of 5 nM and a ligand<br>
concentration of 5 nM, according to Y.-C. Cheng and W.H. Prusoff (Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 1973, 22(23):3099-3108): Ki=(IC5o)/(1 + ([L]/(KD)). Results for the<br>
compounds tested in this assay are presented in Table 1 as an average of results<br>
obtained, and rounded to the nearest 10 nM.<br><br><br>
