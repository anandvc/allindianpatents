				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a disinfecting composition for use in the treatment of livestock buildings and more specifically to a disinfecting composition in aqueous solution especially suitable for the treatment of livestock buildings during the so-called "cleanout" periods which separate each group of animals.<br>
There are currently a  large number of disinfecting compositions   on  the market which  are  intended   for the  cleaning of buildings  associated with industrial  livestock rearing.<br>
In order to be  satisfactory,   such compositions must of course have a  pronounced disinfecting activity,   that is  to  say,   a bactericidal, virucidal and  fungicidal  action;     they must also be  chemically degradable or biodegradable,   and they must be non-toxic and exhibit low corrosiveness.<br>
In  order to meet  these various  criteria,   the publication  FR-A-87   15   212  has   already proposed  a composition  comprising,   by weight,   from  3   to   35% of  quaternary  ammonium  salts,   from   1   to   20%  of straight-chain dialdehyde,   especially glutaraldehyde,   and  from  1   to   15%  of  ethoxylated fatty alcohols.<br>
In use, that composition has been found to be especially active, easy to eliminate, and to pose no danger to public health.<br>
The bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal qualities of quaternary ammonium compounds and glutaraldehyde have been well known for a long time.<br>
In the above-mentioned disinfecting composition, the fatty alcohols act as wetting agents and solubilisers capable of improving the "stability" of the solution and permitting an increase in the proportion of active products.<br>
The combination of quaternary ammonium salts, glutaraldehyde and ethoxylated fatty alcohols therefore makes it possible to obtain, in aqueous solution, very concentrated disinfecting compositions having a very broad spectrum of disinfecting activity and having, especially, a (very pronounced virucidal activity owing to the excellent surfactant activity of the quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
By way of example, the following composition has been found to be especially active:<br>
Didecyldimethylammoniura chloride	18.75 g<br>
Dioctyldimethylammonium chloride	18.75 g<br>
Octyldecyldimethylammonium chloride	37.50 g<br>
Alkyl (C14 50% - C12 40% - C16 10%)<br>
dimethylbenzylammonium chloride	50    g<br>
Glutaraldehyde	62.50 g<br>
Terpineol	20   g<br>
Pine oil	20   g<br>
Ethoxylated fatty alcohol having<br>
10 moles of ethylene oxide and 90%<br>
of active substances	'	40    g<br>
Angelica green colorant (E 131 + E 104)   1   g<br>
Water q.s.	^   1  litre<br>
Despite its undoubted advantages, this disinfecting composition has the disadvantage of having no insecticidal action and therefore of having to be combined with a supplementary treatment using an insecticidal product in order to obtain a complete sanitary "process".<br>
Those operations constitute an economic and material constraint (number of operations, exposure of personnel, lengthening of "cleanout" periods in the livestock buildings, ...).<br>
Consequently, and despite manufacturers' recommendations, users are sometimes tempted to<br>
mix, in the course of the same treatment, disinfecting agents having no insecticidal action and insecticidal agents having no bactericidal or virucidal power.  The mixtures so produced, however, bring together substances which are not necessarily compatible with one another and may even cause poisoning accidents.<br>
In addition, studies which enable manufacturers to determine the efficacy of their product do not take systematic account of the interactions which may occur when the products are associated with another agent and cannot ensure that the products so mixed preserve their activity and their chemical stability.<br>
It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide a polyvalent agent that efficiently combines disinfecting (bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal) properties with insecticidal properties.<br>
Despite this apparent need, it has not been possible hitherto to combine the necessary active substances in a stable water-miscible form at suitable concentrations enabling the efficacy indispensable for a single useful dose to be obtained.<br>
The object of the present invention is to fill this gap by proposing a composition suitable for the treatment of livestock buildings which is chemically stable while having a high degree of both insecticidal and bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal efficacy and which is at the same time non-toxic in respect of the use for which it is intended and which exhibits low corrosiveness towards the materials exposed to it (especially metals).<br>
In accordance with the invention, the composition is characterised in that it comprises, by weight, from 1 to 20% of monoaldehydes or dialdehydes, especially glutaraldehyde, from 3 to 35% of salts, especially quaternary ammonium chlorides, from 1 to 15% of ethoxylated fatty alcohol and from 0.5 to 15% of an insecticidal agent selected from synthetic pyrethrinoids, that is to say, analogues of pyrethrin, which is an insecticide known per se formed by toxic constituents extracted from the flowers and the overground parts of pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum CjLneraria Folium) .<br>
It has surprisingly been realised that it is possible, by starting from the above-mentioned known disinfecting composition forming the subject<br>
matter of document FR-A-87 15 212 and by adjusting the nature and proportions of the solvents and surfactants used, to obtain a stable and efficient polyvalent composition by dint of the incorporation of a particular insecticidal agent.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a disinfecting composition for use in the treatment of livestock buildings, said .composition comprising an aqueous solution by weight:<br>
-	from 1 to 20% of one of a monoaldehyde and a dialdehyde;<br>
-	from 3 to 35% of quaternary ammonium chlorides;<br>
-	from 1 to 15% of ethoxylated fatty alcohols; and<br>
-	from 0.5 to 15% of a synthetic pyrethroid insecticidal agent.<br>
matter of document t]K-A-87 15 212 and by adjusting the nature and proportions of the solvents and surfactants used, tjb obtain a stable and efficient polyvalent composition by dint of the incorporation of a^ particular insecticidal agent.<br>
In accordance with the invention, that insecticidal agent may advantageously be constituted by an isomer or a mixture of isomers of permethrin, especially a mixture of approximately 25% of cis isomer and approximately 75% of'trans isomer.<br>
Permethrin or 3-phenoxybenzyl (1,RS)-cis,trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate is a pyrethrinoid which has a broad spectrum of activity and which is distinguished by good persistence and the efficacy of which permits insecticidal protection when it is used at a low dose.<br>
The composition according to the invention may advantageously comprise approximately 20 g of synthetic pyrethrinoids and especially of permethrin per litre of solution.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the composition comprises from 0.2 to 40% of terpene extract and especially of terpineol.<br>
The addition of terpineol to the composition according to the invention is especially advantageous bearing in mind the fact that that compound, which has notable bactericidal qualities, at the same time acts as a perfume.<br>
By way of example, 100 g of terpineol may be used per litre of solution.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the composition basically comprises, per litre of solution, 60 g of ethoxylated fatty alcohols, constituted by ethoxylated compounds having 11 moles of ethylene oxide, and 45% of active substance.<br>
Those fatty alcohols act as wetting agents and solubilisers.<br>
Advantageously, it is also possible to use, as quaternary ammonium salts, salts broadly similar to those included in the above-mentioned disinfecting composition forming the subject matter of document FR-A-87 15 212, namely<br>
dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides and/or alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides of which the alkyl radicals comprise from 8 to 16 carbon atoms.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the composition basically comprises, per litre of solution, 125 g of quaternary ammonium salt constituted by a mixture of didecyldimethyl-ammonium chloride, dioctyldimethylammonium chloride, octyldecyldimethylammonium chloride and alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides, the latter 
According to a further feature of the invention, the composition basically comprises 62.5 g of glutaraldehyde per litre of solution.<br>
The composition according to the invention may, of course, comprise other additives, such as, for example, a colorant, especially a green colorant.<br>
By way of example, the following composition has been found to be especially advantageous in use:<br>
Didecyldimethylammonium chloride         18.75  g Dioctyldimethylammonium chloride        18.75  g<br>
Octyldecyldimethylamraonium chloride	37.50	g<br>
Alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride	50	g<br>
(Alkyl: C14 50% - C12 40% - C16 10%)<br>
Glutaraldehyde	62.50	g<br>
Permethrin (cis/trans isomer: 25%/75%)	20	g<br>
Ethoxylated fatty alcohol having<br>
11 moles of ethylene oxide and 45% of<br>
active substances	60	g<br>
Terpineol	100	g<br>
Angelica green colorant (E131 - E104)	0.020	g<br>
• Demineralised water q.s.	1 litre<br>
The properties of the composition forming the subject matter of the invention have been demonstrated by the experimental tests described below:<br>
1) Insecticidal efficacy<br>
Two tests were carried out in order to evaluate the insecticidal power of the composition according to the invention.  The use of such tests proved to be indispensable bearing in mind the fact that, although the insecticidal properties of pyrethrinoids are well known per se, it did not automatically follow that there was no risk of the occurrence, within the composition, of an antagonist or of a phenomenon of the active<br>
substances' being "trapped" by the other constituents.<br>
a) Trial carried out in the laboratory<br>
This test was carried out in accordance with the "Protocole experimental destin6 a 6tablir, en laboratoire, I'efficacit6 d'une sp6cialit6 insecticide" (Experimental protocol for determining, in the laboratory/ the efficacy of an insecticidal agent) (Centre National d'Etudes V6t§rinaires et Alimentaires) (National Centre for Veterinary and Food Studies) and demonstrated the efficacy of treatment with the composition according to the invention on different kinds of surface (wood, cement and metal).  The results, which give the percentage mortalities obtained with flies, are compiled in Figure la (corresponding to mortality without treatment) and in Figure Ib (corresponding to mortality after treatment).<br>
From the first 20 minutes of exposure, efficacy is optimum.<br>
b) Trials carried out in situ<br>
Only natural conditions of use enable the real efficacy of an insecticide to be evaluated. The remanence of treatment is an important criterion for this type of product.  Remanence is influenced by the stability and the persistence of the insecticide on surfaces inasmuch as the insecticide acts by contact with the insect. Contact with the insect is itself influenced by the natural fouling of livestock buildings in the course of time.<br>
The trial was carried out in accordance with method No. 107: "Methode d'essai d'efficacit
the fly population in livestock buildings in the course of the 3 months following the treatment.<br>
The trial was carried out on an untreated building, on a building treated with the composition according to the invention and on a building treated with a known insecticide, in this case used as a positive control.<br>
The results obtained are indicated in Figure 2. Conclusion:<br>
The results show that the composition according to the invention is as efficient as a known exclusively insecticidal product.<br>
2) Bactericidal and virucidal efficacy a) Bactericide<br>
Preliminary tests demonstrated that the active<br>
substances responsible for bactericidal activity t<br>
preserve their power.  The synergistic association of the mixture of quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehydes in the prior art disinfecting composition according to document FR-A-87 15 212 is not inhibited in the composition according to the invention.  This check was carried out by<br>
comparing the MBC (minimum bactericidal concentrations) obtained on the strain Pseudomonas aeruorinosa in the presence of hard water at 30°f (method: by microplates according to AFNOR NF T 72-170).  Four variants of the composition according to the invention were tested (the variations concerned the ratios of surfactants and co-solvents).<br>
Results:<br>
For each trial (including prior art disinfecting composition), the Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations are obtained for dilutions lower than or equal to 0.125%.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Bactericidal efficacy is maintained compared with the prior art disinfecting composition which is authorised for use at a dilution of 0.5% on the Pseudomonas strain aeruginosa;  the use of the composition according to the invention is intended for a dilution of 2%.<br>
b) Virucide<br>
The preliminary trial was carried out by micro-method on the virus of Talfan's disease (type 1 picornavirus) which is well known for its resistance to disinfectants, which resistance therefore constitutes the limiting factor for the usable dilution.<br>
Results:<br>
The composition according to the invention/ diluted to 2%, leads to a fall of at least 3 Log in the viral content, in conformity with the requirements of the Laboratoire des Medicaments V6terinaires (Laboratory of Veterinary Medicaments) regarding disinfectants for agricultural use.<br>
3) Chemical stability<br>
(The stability study carried out on the composition comprises a check on the appearance of the product, measurement of the pH and the content of the active substances.  The study is carried out on samples stored in polypropylene bottles in an oven at 37°C in order to obtain an accelerated ageing profile.<br>
The data below correspond to groups stored at 37°C for more than 3 months.<br>
a)	Appearance of the samples<br>
Absence of precipitates<br>
No phase separation of the constituents<br>
Stable colouring<br>
In other words, appearance unchanged after 3 months at 37°C.<br>
b)	Stability of the aldehydes<br>
The stability at 37°C of the aldehydes is represented in Figure 3.<br>
No significant degradation after 99 days at 37°C.<br>
c)	Stability of the quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
The stability at 37°C of the quaternary ammonium compounds is represented in Figure 4.<br>
No significant degradation after 99 days at 37°C.<br>
d)	Stability of permethrin<br>
The stability at 37°C of permethrin is represented in Figure 5.<br>
No significant degradation after 99 days at 37°C.<br>
e)	Variations in the pH<br>
The evolution of the pH at 37°C is represented in Figure 6.<br>
The pH decreases slightly after two months.<br>
f)	Observations<br>
The graphs below correspond to the results of quantitative analyses carried out on six different batches of the composition according to the invention.  There is some variation between the batches in respect of the percentages of excipients.<br>
It will be noted that the active substances exhibit satisfactory resistance to the ageing conditions at 37°C for at least three months.<br>
4) Toxicological aspect<br>
The various constituents of the composition according to the invention do not present any particular danger at the useful dose provided for (2% in aqueous dilution).<br>
5) Corrosiveness of the composition<br>
At the useful doses, the composition does not present any particular risk to the materials exposed to the treatments.<br><br><br><br>
