5                                                     Field of the Invention<br>
This invention pertains to a diaphragm expansion tank and exemplary flow-<br>
through connectors therefor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Expansion tanks are known for use in flow systems for controlling flow of<br>
10      liquid under varying pressures. Generally, expansion tanks comprise an essentially<br>
cylindrical or spherical housing containing a bladder-type diaphragm which divides<br>
areas of a liquid and a pressurized gas. For a general discussion of expansion tanks and<br>
bladder-type diapbragms, see U.S. Patent No. 4,784,181 to Hilveidink entitled<br>
"Expansion Tank with a Bladder-Type Diaphragm".<br>
15                 An expansion tank generally has one nozzle through which liquid flows in and<br>
out depending on the pressure level controlled by the contraction and expansion of the<br>
interior diaphragm. Many municipalitics require that expansion tanks for use with<br>
potable water include devices to ensure that water circulates through the tank and that<br>
there is not actually stagnant water in the tank when the tank is "empty".<br>
20                                                 Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the invention is a bladder. The bladder includes a non-flexible<br>
diaphragm having a peripheral edge and an aperture adapted and constructed to receive<br>
a flow-through connector, and a flexible diaphragm having a peripheral edge. The<br>
peripheral edges of the non-flexible diaphragm md the flexible diaphragm are sealed to<br>
25      one another to form a ciscumferential seam. The peripheral edges of the non-flexible<br>
and flexible diaphragms may be heat sealed to each other. The bladder may further<br>
include a clench ring. Where a clench ring is used, the peripheral edge of the non-<br>
flexible diaphragm includes a circumferential recess and the peripheral edge of the<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/010441                                                                                                  PCT/US2004/023252<br>
flexible diaphragm includes a circumferential rib. The circumferential recess meshes<br>
with the circumferential rib and the peripheral edges of the non-flexible diaphragm and<br>
the flexible diaphragm are clamped together by the clench ring.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is an expansion tank. The expansion tank<br>
5      includes an outer shell having a side wall and opposite end walls, a flow-through<br>
connector, and a bladder disposed within the outer shell. The bladder includes a<br>
non-flexible diaphragm having a peripheral edge aud a flexible diaphragm having a<br>
peripheral edge. The non-flexible diaphragm is positioned between the flow-connector<br>
and the flexible diaphragm and having an aperture which is connected to either the<br>
10      outer shell or the flow-through connector such that the flow-through connector provides<br>
fluidic communication between an exterior of the expansion tank and an interior of the<br>
bladder. The peripheral edges of the non-flexible diaphragm and the flexible<br>
diaphragm are sealed to one another to form a circumferential seam, and a space within<br>
the bladder is fluidicly isolated from a space between the bladder and the outer shell.<br>
15                 The flow-through connector may include a nipple having first and second end.<br>
The frist end has a plurality of tabs that are manipulable between an insertion position<br>
and a securing position to secure the nipple to the bladder. The flow-connector may<br>
further include a first retainer ring fixedly attached to the nipple and disposed between<br>
the bladder and the outer shell, a second retainer ring disposed about the nipple and<br>
20      within the bladder, a first o-ring disposed between the first retainer ring and the<br>
bladder, and a second o-ring disposed between the second retainer ring and the bladder.<br>
In the securing position the tabs press the second retainer ring towards the first retainer<br>
ring to create a seal preventing fluidic communication between an. interior of the<br>
bladder and a space between the bladder and the outer shell.<br>
25                 In an alternative embodiment, the flow-through connector includes a non-<br>
rotating flow guidance element defining a central high pressure inflow channel, a low<br>
pressure outflow channel disposed concentrically about the central inflow channel, and<br>
a contoured path through which water passes out of the inflow channel into the bladder<br>
and containing a plurality of inlets into the low pressure outflow channel having a total<br>
30      cross sectional area less than or equal to the total cross sectional area of the inflow<br>
channel. When the flexible diaphragm rests against the cap, the bladder is essentially<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/010441                                                                                                  PCT/US2004/023252<br>
empty, and the tank is adapted and constructed to circulate water such that a first<br>
portion of water entering the tank leaves the tank before a second portion of water<br>
entering the tank after the first portion of water leaves the tank. The plane of an inlet<br>
opening of the high pressure in flow channel may be oriented perpendicular to that of<br>
5      an outlet opening of the in flow channel.<br>
Optionally, in the embodiment where the bladder includes a clench ring that<br>
clamps the peripheral edges of the flexible and non-flexible diaphragms together, the<br>
plane formed by the clench ring may be perpendicular to the center line of the<br>
expansion tank. The housing of the tank may include inward projections that lie in a<br>
10     plane that is perpendicular to the center line of the expansion tank and is at a distance<br>
from the liquid port such that the clench ring of the bladder is between me liquid port<br>
and the plane in which the inward projections lie. Typically, the inward projections<br>
project inward enough to prevent movement of the clench ring along the center line of<br>
the expansion tank but do not project inward enough to significantly prevent expansion<br>
15      of the second diaphragm.<br>

5                                                      Detailed Description<br>
A bladder 10 is shown in an expanded state in Figure 1. Bladder 10 includes a<br>
first non-flexible diaphragm 12 attd a second flexible diaphragm 14. The bladder is also<br>
provided with an aperture 16. The peripheral edges 18 and 20 of the first and the<br>
second diaphragms, respectively, are connected to each other to form a seal. In the<br>
10      embodiment shown (see also Figure 2) the peripheral edges 18 and 20, which project to<br>
the outside, lie against each other and are clamped together by a clench ring 22. As<br>
shown in Figure 2A the peripheral edge 20 of the flexible diaphragm 14 is provided<br>
with a circumferential rib 24 that meshes with a circumferential recess 26 on the<br>
peripheral edge 18 of the non-flexible diaphragm 12 in order to obtain a seal.<br>
15                 In an alternative embodiment, the peripheral edges of the-nun-ftexible<br>
diaphragm 12 and flexible diaphragm 14 are heat sealed together. In this embodiment,<br>
it is not necessary for the peripheral edges of the diaphragms to be clamped together or<br>
to have a circumferential rib or groove.<br>
The non-flexible diaphragm may be produced from a polymer that is relatively<br>
20      stiff. When the bladder 10 is used to hold potable water, the polymer is preferably<br>
approved for use with food or is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and non-mutagenic and<br>
does not leach such materials into the water. Exemplary materials for use in producing<br>
the non-flexible diaphragm 12 include but are not limited to polypropylene, teflon,<br>
nylon, polyalkylene terephthalate, polyformaldehyde, polystyrene, poly(methyl<br>
25      methacrylate), polycarbonate, and poly(hexylisocyanate).<br>
The second flexible diaphragm may be produced from a resilient, flexible<br>
polymer. When the bladder 10 is used to hold potable water, the polymer is preferably<br>
approved for use with food by the appropriate government agency or is non-toxic, non-<br>
carcinogenic and non-mutagenic and does not leach such materials into the water.<br>
30      Exemplary materials for use in producing Ihe flexible diaphragm 14 include but are not<br>

WO 2005/010441                                                                                                  PCT/US2004/023252<br>
limited to isobutylene, polybutadiene, poly(dimethylsiloxane), poly(cis-l,4-isoprene),<br>
poly(trans-l,4-isoprene), and thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
The bladder 10 of the invention is suitable for use In an expansion tank. An<br>
exemplary tank 110 includes a central portion 40 that defines a side wall of tank 110.<br>
5      Central portion 40 is capped by first dome 42 and second dome 44 to make an outer<br>
shell 46 (Figure 3). Those skilled in the art will also recognize that outer shell 46 may<br>
be formed out of two domes welded together or in other configurations. The bladder 10<br>
sits within outer shell 46. When empty, the pressure of gas between outer shell 46 and<br>
bladder 10 causes flexible diaphragm 14 to collapse against non-flexible diaphragm 12.<br>
10                In one embodiment, in order to prevent the flexible diaphragm 14 from fully<br>
closing the aperture 16 of the non-flexible diaphragm 12 when the liquid is expelled<br>
from the bladder 10, the flexible diaphragm 14 is provided on the inside, at the point<br>
opposite the aperture 16, with a number of raised pads 28 (Figure 4A), between which<br>
the liquid can flow from the aperture 16 into the bladder through grooves 29. The pads<br>
15     28 prevent the development of a vacuum between the two diaphragms. Figure 4B<br>
shows the bladder 10 depicted in Figure 1 in its collapsed State. When liquid enters the<br>
bladder 10, it exerts pressure on the inside of the bladder and causes the flexible<br>
diaphragm 14 to expand. This expansion compresses the gas in the space between the<br>
flexible diaphragm 14 and the outer shell 46. When the liquid pressure inside the<br>
20     bladder 10 is less than the pressure of the gas, the gas expands and pushes against the<br>
flexible diaphragm 14, causing it to collapse against non-flexible diaphragm 12 and<br>
expel the liquid. The operation of diaphragm expansion tanks is well known to those<br>
skilled in the art and is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,784,181,<br>
To pass into bladder 10, water must pass through an opening in outer shell 46<br>
25      and aperture 16 of non-flexible diaphragm 12. A flaw-through nozzle attachment that<br>
passes through outer shell 46, for example, through second dome 44, and is sealingly<br>
attached to non-flexible diaphragm 12 at one end and to a pipe or other apparatus at the<br>
other end allows water to flow from the pipe into and out of the bladder 10 without<br>
entering the space between bladder 10 and outer shell 46. An exemplary flow-through<br>
30     nozzle attachment for use with bladder 10 is described in U.S. Patent 4,784,181, and<br>
those skilled in the art will be familiar with other flow-through attachments that are<br>

WO 2005/010441                                                                                                   PCT/US2004/023252<br>
appropriate for use with the invention, In an alternative embodiment, the flow-through<br>
nozzle attachment 120 depicted in Figure 5 may be employed.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 and ia larger scale in Figure 5A, nipple 50 extends<br>
through non-flexible diaphragm 12 to allow liquid to pass into bladder 10. As shown in<br>
5     Figure 5A, nipple 50 is positioned to extend through outer shell 46. Within outer shell<br>
46, the nipple 50 further extends through first retainer ring 52 and second retainer ring<br>
54 that secure bladder 10 therebetween. O-rings 56 are used as sealing devices at the<br>
interfaces of the bladder 10 with first retainer ring 52 and second retainer ring 54. The<br>
nipple 50 is welded to first retainer ring 52 on the side closest to the outer shell 46. In<br>
10     one embodiment, the o-rings 56 are made of Viton® and the nipple 50 and retainer<br>
rings 52 and 54 are made of stainless steel.<br>
The nipple 50 includes, at one end, at least one tab 60 that may be made of the<br>
same material as tbe nipple 50. Tabs 60 may be an integral portion of nipple 50.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates three such tabs 60; a fourth is not shown, The tabs 60 are designed<br>
15      to bo manipulable to secure the end of the nipple 50 in place. After insertion of the<br>
nipple 50 through the first retainer ring 52,. bladder 50, and second retainer ring 54, the<br>
tabs 60 are folded over in a position to contact the outer rim of the second retainer ring<br>
54 and to secure the nipple 50 against second retainer ring 54. Once the nipple 50 is in<br>
place, liquid can pass through it into bladder 10 without leaking into the space between<br>
20      outer shell 46 and bladder 10.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that flow-through nozzle attachment 120<br>
may also be used with prior art bladders and diaphragm tanks, not just the inventive<br>
bladders described herein. Flow-through nozzle attachment 120 may be used to<br>
connect an expansion tank, for example, expansion tanks employing bladder 10, to a<br>
25      system in which there is a quantity of liquid, such as a water pipe system or a hot water<br>
supply system.<br>
Where the bladder is used to hold potable water, it is desirable to promote<br>
circulation of water through the bladder 10 so that water enters and leaves the bladder<br>
on a "first-in-first-out" (FIFO) basis rather than a "last-in-first-out" (LIFO) basis. Even<br>
30     if the circulation of water is imperfect, that is, water enters and leaves the bladder on<br>
some combination of FIFO and LIFO, tocreased circulation reduces the time that water<br>

WO 2005/010441                                                                                                   PCT/US2004/023252<br>
is resident in the bladder and prevents the water from becoming stagnant. Exemplary<br>
flow diverters that may be used to promote water circulation include that disclosed by<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,343,622, and additional diverters are well-known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
5                 In an alternative embodiment, the bladder 10 is used with a flow diverter 130 as<br>
shown in Figure 6. A flow guidance element 70 of the flow-through diverter device<br>
130 is positioned in a main liquid flow path to face in an upstream direction. In one<br>
embodiment, the flow guidance element 70 resembles that of a scooping device.<br>
The flow guidance element 70 establishes the inlet flow passage 72 to divert<br>
10      liquid from the main liquid flow path into the bladder 10. The inlet flow passage 72 is<br>
an interior cylindrical shaped passage running along the longitudinal axis of the flow-<br>
through diverter device 130. The design of the flow guidance element 70 and inlet flow<br>
passage 72 allows a high pressure water flow into the bladder 10.<br>
Water flows out of bladder 10 via discharge inlets 74 through discharge flow<br>
15      passages 76. In one embodiment, the discharge flow passages 76. are arranged<br>
circumterentially around the inlet flow passage 72. In another embodiment, flow-<br>
through diverter 130 has a single  annular discharge flow passage 76 suroundmg inlet<br>
flow passage 72. A plurality of discharge inlets 74 all direct water into the single<br>
discharge flow passage 76. Water passes from the discharge flow passage(s) 76 into<br>
20     the main liquid flow path. The discharge flow passage(s) 76 need not extend as far into<br>
the main liquid flow path as inlet flow passage 72.<br>
The upper portions of inlet flow passage 72 and the portions of flow-through<br>
diverter 130 that support discharge inlets 74 may be shaped according to a "beehive<br>
crown" design, as shown in Figure 6. This round shape helps flexible diaphragm 14<br>
25      conform to the opposite surface of bladder 10 when the bladder 10 is empty. The<br>
conforming fit of the two diaphragms when flexible diaphragm 14 is pressed against<br>
non-flexible diaphragm 12 helps ensure that all water is expelled from the bladder as it<br>
empties. Also, the "beehive crown" shape helps water initially entering empty bladder<br>
10 to displace flexible diaphragm 14 away from non-flexible bladder 12.<br>

WO 2005/010441                                                                                                   PCT/US2004/023252<br>
One skilled in the art will recogoize that flow-through diverter 130 may be used<br>
with other double-diaphragm tanks besides those disclosed herein. In addition, flow-<br>
through diverter 130 may also be used with single-diaphragm tanks.<br>
