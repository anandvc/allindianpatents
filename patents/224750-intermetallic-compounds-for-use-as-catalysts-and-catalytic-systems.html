				<td>A CATALYST FOR USE IN A CATALYTIC<br>
SYSTEM AND A FUEL CELL<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to intermetallic compounds for use as catalysts and<br>
catalytic systems, and, more particularly, to ordered intermetallic compounds used as<br>
electrocatalysts in fuel cell applications.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without, itself,<br>
being consumed in the reaction. Catalyzed reactions proceed through a mechanism that is not<br>
apparent in the stoichiometry of the reaction. For example, catalysts may be used in the rate-<br>
determining step of a reaction and later re-formed, so there is no net change in the<br>
concentration of the catalyst during the reaction. Specifically, catalysts lower the activation<br>
energy associated with the rate-determining step which accelerates the chemical reaction.<br>
Many types of materials may function as catalysts for different types of reactions.<br>
Catalysts may be used in numerous applications. For example, a fuel cell is an<br>
electrochemical device that utilizes catalysts. Typically, a fuel cell includes an anode, a<br>
cathode, and a solid or liquid electrolyte therebetween. Fuel materials (e.g., hydrogen, fossil<br>
fuels, and small organic molecules) are brought in contact with the anode, and an oxidizing<br>
gas (e.g., oxygen and air) is brought in contact with the cathode. The fuel is oxidized in a<br>
chemical reaction which may be accelerated by the presence of a catalyst at the anode. The<br>
oxidizing gas is reduced in a chemical reaction which also may be accelerated by a catalyst at<br>
the cathode. The cell generates electricity when electrons generated in the fuel oxidation<br>
reaction at the anode flow through an external circuit to the cathode where the electrons are<br>
consumed in the reduction reaction.<br>
A number of different materials have been investigated for use as catalysts an fuel cell<br>
electrodes (i.e., anodes and cathodes). In particular, anodes in cells that utilize small organic<br>
molecule fuels (e.g., methanol, formic acid, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, amongst others)<br>
must satisfy a number of property requirements. For example, in these fuel cells the anode<br>
must sufficiently catalyze the oxidation reaction, while minimizing the strong binding of CO,<br>
which is often produced in intermediate reactions, to the surface. This so-called "CO<br>
poisoning" can limit the catalytic activity of the anode over time which can severely impair<br>
cell maximum output power and efficiency.<br>
Pure transition metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni) have been used as electrocatalysts in small<br>
organic molecule fuel cells because of their high catalytic activity for these fuels. However,<br>
these metals, and particularly Pt, readily become poisoned with CO thus limiting cell<br>
performance over time. CO poisoning is particularly problematic at lower temperatures (e.g.,<br>
less than 200 degrees C).<br>
Surface modified transition metal electrodes have also been investigated in small<br>
organic molecule fuel cells. Surface modification involves adsorbing monolayer amounts of<br>
metal adatoms (e.g., Bi) on the surface of the electrode. The metal adatoms may be selected<br>
from groups of metals that weakly bind oxygen, which is necessary for oxidation reactions,<br>
thus, enhancing the oxidation of CO to CO2 and mitigating CO poisoning. However, the<br>
surface composition of surface modified electrodes may change over time as the metal<br>
adatoms react with impurities, desorb, or otherwise migrate from the electrode surface. Thus,<br>
CO poisoning can increase over time and may compromise cell performance.<br>
Alloys of transition metals (e.g., Pt-Ru, Pt-Rh) have also been used as electrodes in<br>
small organic molecule fuel cells. However, while such alloys may perform better than Pt<br>
electrodes, they still may be susceptible to CO poisoning effects. Moreover, the composition<br>
of such alloys may change over time as species (e.g., Ru, Rh) migrate from the surface into<br>
the bulk to leave primarily the other alloy component (e.g., Pt) at the surface, which can be<br>
more susceptible to CO poisoning.<br>
CO poisoning may also prevent hydrogen gas that includes relatively high levels of<br>
CO (e.g., greater than about 0.01 mole percent) from being used as a fuel in conventional<br>
hydrogen fuel cells that operate at relatively low temperatures (e.g., 80 degrees C or less).<br>
The rapid adsorption of CO on electrode surfaces of these cells when oxidizing hydrogen gas,<br>
which includes high levels of CO, rapidly reduces the maximum output power and efficiency<br>
of such cells to unacceptable levels. Hydrogen gas that is produced by processing<br>
hydrocarbons (e.g., natural gas) in a reformer typically includes between about 3 and 10 mole<br>
percent CO. Therefore, such hydrogen gas must be further processed (e.g., using water gas<br>
shift reactors and/or preferential oxidizers) to reduce the CO concentration to acceptable<br>
levels (typically less than 0.001 mole percent) prior to using in conventional fuel cells at low<br>
temperatures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention involve the recognition that ordered<br>
intermetallic compounds may be used as high performing catalytic materials. The ordered<br>
intermetallic compounds may be used to catalyze reactions in fuel cells, amongst numerous<br>
other applications. As described further below, the unique structure of ordered intermetallic<br>
compounds enables such compounds to function as highly efficient catalysts. Ordered<br>
intermetallic compounds may be tailored to produce desired electronic and/or geometric<br>
effects that optimize catalytic behavior for specific reactions.<br>
As used herein, the term "ordered intermetallic compound" refers to compounds that<br>
comprise more than one metal and have an ordered atomic structure. In an ordered<br>
intermetallic compound, substantially all unit cells include the same arrangement of metal<br>
atoms. Thus, a given atomic site in a unit cell is occupied by the same type of metal atom<br>
(e.g., Pt) in substantially all unit cells of an ordered intermetallic compound. Defects, which<br>
may be present in an ordered intermetallic compound, can cause a small number of unit cells<br>
in an ordered intermetallic compound to have a different arrangement of metal atoms than the<br>
majority of the unit cells. Defect types, for example, include vacancies, interstitials, atom<br>
substitutions and anti-site defects. In some cases, the defect concentration may be about 1<br>
defect per 10 atoms, though, in many cases, the defect concentration is much lower (e.g., 1<br>
defect per 105 atoms or less).<br>
In the present application, the term "ordered intermetallic compound" has the same<br>
meaning as the terms "intermetallic compound," "intermetallic," and "ordered intermetallic."<br>
All of these terms are used interchangeably throughout the application.<br>
Ordered intermetallic compounds are to be distinguished from metal alloys and metal<br>
solid solutions. Alloys and solid solutions do not have an ordered atomic structure, as<br>
described above. Metal atoms are arranged randomly in unit cells of alloys and solid<br>
solutions. That is, a given atomic site may be occupied by different types of atoms in<br>
different unit cells of an alloy or solid solution. For example, in a 50:50:: Pt:Ru alloy<br>
(Pt0.5Ru0.5), the probability of an Ru atom occupying a specific site is 50% and the probability<br>
of a Pt atom occupying a specific site is 50%.<br>
Ordered intermetallic compounds and their distinctions from alloys and solid<br>
solutions have been described in a number of references, for example, "Challenges and<br>
Opportunities in Solid-State Chemistry," DiSalvo, F. J., Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 72, No. 10,<br>
p. 1799-1807,2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. However, it is also noted that<br>
other references have used the term "intermetallic compound" when referring to an "alloy" or<br>
"solid solution" as defined herein.<br>
As described above, ordered intermetallic compounds have the same arrangement of<br>
atoms throughout the crystal. Generally, the catalytic properties of a compound are<br>
influenced by the atomic arrangement of its constituent elements (e.g., the distance between<br>
and identity of nearest neighbor atoms). A given surface of an ordered intermetallic<br>
compound, defined by a set of three Miller indices, therefore, has a uniform catalytic<br>
behavior. If an intermetallic compound has a high catalytic activity for a particular reaction,<br>
then the entire surface of the intermetallic compound can provide that same high catalytic<br>
activity. In this way, ordered intermetallic compounds may be used to provide optimal<br>
catalytic performance. Fig. 1 schematically shows the atomic structure of the (001) plane of<br>
a PtBi ordered intermetallic compound.<br>
In contrast, alloys and solid solutions have random arrangements of atoms. Thus,<br>
catalytic behavior varies across surfaces of alloys and solid solutions as the distance between<br>
and identity of nearest neighbor atoms varies. Therefore, even though alloys and solid<br>
solutions may have some highly catalytic regions, such compounds also have regions of<br>
lower catalytic activity. The regions of lower catalytic activity limit the overall ability of<br>
alloys and solid solutions to function as catalysts. For example, Pt alloys and solid solutions<br>
(e.g., Pt-Ru) may include regions where Pt atoms become randomly segregated. Because<br>
such segregates can behave like bulk Pt, these regions are highly susceptible to CO poisoning<br>
as described above. The CO poisoning in these regions, thus, can limit the overall catalytic<br>
performance of these alloys and solid solutions. Since ordered intermetallic Pt compounds<br>
(e.g., BiPt) do not have regions of Pt segregation, CO poisoning may be avoided across the<br>
entire surface. Fig. 2 schematically shows the atomic structure of the (111) plane of a<br>
P0.5Ru0.5 alloy.<br>
Ordered intermetallic compounds also have a more stable atomic arrangement as<br>
compared to alloys and solid solutions. This stability results in consistent catalytic behavior<br>
that may be maintained over time. Some atoms in alloys and solid solutions are more prone<br>
to migrate to or from the surface into or out of the bulk over time, and thus, catalytic behavior<br>
may deteriorate.<br>
The stability and ordered structure of intermetallic compounds also leads to less<br>
sample-to-sample variation in catalytic behavior than found in alloys and solid solutions,<br>
especially in small particles which may be preferred in some applications as described further<br>
below. For example, all catalytic surfaces of a specific orientation (e.g., (001) Pt plane in<br>
BiPt) of the same intermetallic compound have the same catalytic activity; while, all catalytic<br>
surfaces of a specific orientation of an alloy or solid solution need not have the same catalytic<br>
activity due to the random occupancy of surface sites.<br>
A variety of ordered intermetallic compounds may be used as catalysts according to<br>
different embodiments of the present invention. As described further below, different<br>
intermetallic compounds may be more suited to catalyze certain reactions.<br>
Typically, one (or more) metallic components) of the intermetallic compound has<br>
(have) a high catalytic activity for the reaction that the intermetallic compound is used to<br>
catalyze. A number of transition metals (e.g., platinum, palladium, nickel, cobalt, iron,<br>
manganese, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, and iridium) are known to have relatively high<br>
catalytic activities for certain fuels and may be suitable as components in intermetallic<br>
compounds of the invention in embodiments that involve catalyzing such fuels. In particular,<br>
platinum is one of the most efficient catalytic materials for the oxidation of certain fuels such<br>
as small organic molecule fuels or hydrogen. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention,<br>
including embodiments that utilize small organic molecule fuels or hydrogen, platinum may<br>
be a preferred component of the intermetallic compound.<br>
The second metallic component of the intermetallic compound is selected from the<br>
group of metals capable of forming an intermetallic compound with the first component. The<br>
ability of metals to form intermetallic compounds may readily be determined by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art from published phase diagrams which indicate the presence of<br>
intermetallic phases.<br>
The second metallic component may also be selected based on considerations the type<br>
of reaction to be catalyzed. For example, when catalyzing the oxidation of small organic<br>
molecule fuels, it may be desirable to select a metal as the second component that binds<br>
oxygen weakly enough so as to limit CO poisoning by promoting the final oxidation of CO to<br>
CO2, which leaves the surface. Metals that weakly bind oxygen include heavier Group III-<br>
VI metals such as bismuth, lead, indium, germanium, lead, tin, gallium, cadmium, and<br>
antimony. In particular, lead, bismuth, gallium and indium may be effective in limiting CO<br>
poisoning, especially when combined with platinum, and are preferred in some embodiments<br>
of the invention.<br>
Examples of suitable intermetallic compounds that may be used in accordance with<br>
the invention include, but are not limited to, BiPt, BfePt, PtIn, PtPb, PtGe, PtIn2, Pttn3, Pt3In7,<br>
PdGe, PdSb, IrBi, NiBi, PtSn, PtSn2, Pt3Sn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn4, PtSb, PtSb2, RhBi, PtGa, PtCd2,<br>
PtMn, and BiPd. Other ordered intermetallic compounds also may be used in accordance<br>
with the invention including other intermetallic compounds that comprise the aforementioned<br>
elements at different stoichiometrics.<br>
It should be understood that intermetallic compounds of the invention may have a<br>
variety of stoichiometric ratios. For example, if a binary intermetallic compound is<br>
represented by the general formula AxBy, then x may equal 1,2,3 and the like; and y may<br>
equal 1,2,3, and the like. In some cases, intermetallic compounds having a 1:1<br>
stoichiometric ratio (e.g., x - 1 and y=1) may exhibit particularly high electrocatalytic<br>
activity. It should also be understood that the value of x or y may be slightly greater or<br>
slightly less than the whole numbers noted above, in part, due to the presence of defects (e.g.,<br>
vacancies, interstitials, atom substitutions, anti-site defects) in the intermetallic compound<br>
atomic structure. For example, even though x or y may be represented in a formula as 1, the<br>
actual values of x or y may be between about 0.9 and 1.1 due to the presence of defects.<br>
Suitable intermetallic compounds may be binary compounds (represented by the<br>
general formula AxBy). It should also be understood that higher order intermetallic<br>
compounds may also be used including ternary intermetallic compounds (represented by the<br>
general formula AxByCz), quarternary intermetallic compounds (represented by the general<br>
formula AxByCzDw), and the like. Also, mixtures and alloys of binaries (e.g., PtBi1-xPbx) are<br>
also suitable.<br>
The ordered intermetallic compounds described herein may be used as catalysts in a<br>
variety of different reactions. In one set of preferred embodiments, the intermetallic<br>
compounds are used to catalyze oxidation reactions in fuel cell applications. Any suitable<br>
fuel used in fuel cells may be catalyzed using the ordered intermetallic compounds of the<br>
invention. Suitable fuels include small organic molecule fuels, hydrogen, and fossil fuels,<br>
amongst others.<br>
The intermetallic compounds described herein may be particularly suitable for<br>
catalyzing the oxidation of small organic molecule fuels. Small organic molecule fuels are<br>
characterized by having one to four carbon atoms per molecule, such as formic acid,<br>
methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, 2 butyne l,4diol, 2 butene 1,4 diol, acetic acid, and oxalic<br>
acid. It should be understood that molecules with a larger number of carbon atoms per<br>
molecule may also be used in some embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The intermetallic compounds described herein also may be particularly suitable for<br>
catalyzing the oxidation of hydrogen. As described further below, intermetallic compounds<br>
of the invention may catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen even in the presence of relatively<br>
high concentrations of CO (e.g., greater than about 0.01 mole percent) because the structure<br>
of the intermetallic compounds can limit the binding of CO to surfaces of the compounds,<br>
thus, limiting CO poisoning. The ability to use hydrogen that includes relatively high<br>
concentrations of CO can lead to significant advantages because this may reduce, or<br>
eliminate, processing steps that are employed in order to lower the concentration of CO in<br>
hydrogen that is produced, for example, by steam reforming. In some cases, the intermetallic<br>
compounds may catalyze the reaction that converts CO to CO2 at an electrode surface of the<br>
fuel cell. In addition to consuming CO, this reaction may advantageously increase the<br>
efficiency of the fuel cell. When used in hydrogen fuel cells, the intermetallic compound<br>
may also be used to catalyze fuel reformation.<br>
It should be understood that the intermetallic compounds may also be used as highly<br>
efficient catalysts in a number of reactions including reactions that are not fuel cell-based.<br>
Other applications include, but are not limited to, water purification, toxic waste destruction,<br>
controlled explosive destruction and conversion of CO to CO2 for pollution migration.<br>
Though the intermetallic compounds listed herein may be suitable to catalyze a<br>
number of different reactions as a result of the above-described structural advantages of<br>
intermetallic compounds, certain intermetallics may be better suited to catalyze certain<br>
reactions. It has been found that BiPt, BiPt2, PtPb and PtIn are particularly well suited for<br>
catalyzing the oxidation of formic acid. PtPb, PtSn and PtIn have been found to be<br>
particularly well suited for the oxidation of methanol, and PtPb, PtBi and PtIn have been<br>
shown to be particularly well suited for the partial oxidation of ethanol. The Examples below<br>
further illustrate the performance of specific intermetallic compounds with respect to certain<br>
fuels.<br>
In some cases, it may be desired to catalyze the reaction at intermetallic compound<br>
surfaces having a specific orientation (e.g., (001)Pt plane in BiPt). Certain orientations may<br>
lead to increased catalytic activity for certain fuels.<br>
It has been found that the surface electronic structure of an intermetallic compound is<br>
an important factor in determining its ability to optimally catalyze a particular reaction. For<br>
example, the electronic structure of a specific intermetallic compound may cause the<br>
intermetallic to have an increased affinity for a particular fuel which can enhance catalytic<br>
performance. The electronic structure of a specific intermetallic may also enable formation<br>
of reaction intermediates (e.g., surface oxides) at lower potentials during oxidation of a<br>
specific fuel which also increases catalytic activity. For example, the electronic structure of<br>
BiPt appears to result in an increased affinity for formic acid and the ability to enable<br>
formation of reaction intermediates during oxidation of formic acid, as illustrated further in<br>
the Examples below.<br>
The atomic geometry of the surface of an intermetallic compound appears to be an<br>
important factor in determining its optimal ability to catalyze a particular reaction. In some<br>
cases, certain interatomic distances (or ranges thereof) may lead to improved adsorption for<br>
particular fuels and, thus, increased catalytic behavior. In other cases, certain interatomic<br>
distances (or ranges thereof) may limit binding of CO to surfaces and, thus, limit CO<br>
poisoning and enhance catalytic behavior. For example, the increase in interatomic nearest<br>
neighbor distance along one axis between Pt-Pt atoms in BiPt (4.3 Angstroms on the (001)<br>
plane) from the interatomic nearest neighbor distance between Pt-Pt atoms in Pt (2.77<br>
Angstroms) has been shown to limit or eliminate CO poisoning. In some cases, it may be<br>
preferred for the intermetallic compounds to have interatomic nearest neighbor distances<br>
(e.g., between Pt-Pt atoms) of greater than at least 3.0 Angstroms along at least one axis; in<br>
some cases, greater than 3.2 Angstroms; in some cases, greater than 3.5 Angstroms; and, in<br>
some cases, greater than 4.0 Angstroms. In some of these cases, it may be preferred for the<br>
intermetallic compounds to have any of the above-noted interatomic nearest neighbor<br>
distances (e.g., greater than 3.0,3.2,3.5 or 4.0 Angstroms) along one axis and about 2.8<br>
Angstroms along a second axis.<br>
By controlling the electronic structures and geometric structure of an intermetallic<br>
compound through its composition, therefore, it is possible to optimize catalytic activity for<br>
certain fuels. That is, certain intermetallic compounds may be optimally matched with<br>
certain fuels using the methods of the present invention.<br>
Screening techniques (See, e.g., van Dover, R. B.; Schneemeyer, L. F.; Fleming, R.<br>
M. Nature 1998, 392, 162) may be useful in rapidly determining which intermetallic<br>
compounds are particularly well-suited to catalyze certain types of reactions (e.g., fuel<br>
oxidation reactions). One screening technique is thermographic analysis. This technique<br>
involves forming an electrode by sputtering, or other methods, to produce a spread of<br>
compositions on a substrate which may include intermetallic compounds. This<br>
thermographic technique is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The electrode<br>
and a reference electrode may be submerged in an electrolyte containing a possible fuel. A<br>
thermographic map of the electrode surface is generated at several different, but uniform,<br>
potentials. The maps can then be examined by eye or image processing to determine the<br>
extent of electrocatalytic activity at different locations on the electrode surface which<br>
correspond to different compositions. The locations with the highest catalytic activity<br>
generally show the largest temperature changes. Such locations may be further analyzed to<br>
determine the composition (e.g., using XRF) and atomic structure (e.g., using XRD) of the<br>
material at that location. This information may be used to determine which intermetallic<br>
compounds may be particularly well-suited to catalyze the oxidation of certain fuels.<br>
A second screening technique is scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). An<br>
electrode is produced by sputtering a spread of compositions on a substrate, as described<br>
above in connection with the thermographic technique. After submersing the substrate in a<br>
suitable electrolyte/fuel mixture, a small electrochemical probe is scanned across the<br>
electrode surface to measure current at different locations (with high spatial resolution) and probe potentials, thereby generating a map of the electrocatalytic activity on the surface. The<br>
map may be examined to determine the extent of electrocatalytic activity at different<br>
locations. Such locations may be further analyzed to determine the composition (e.g., using<br>
XRF) and atomic structure (e.g., using XRD) of the material at that location. This<br>
information may be used to determine which intermetallic compounds may be particularly<br>
well-suited to catalyze the oxidation of certain fuels.<br>
The intermetallic compounds of the invention may be formed using known<br>
techniques. One suitable technique can involve forming a mixture that includes the desired<br>
stoichiometric ratios of the different metal components in solid form, (e.g., powder). The<br>
mixture may be thoroughly mixed and pressed to form a dense solid (e.g., a pellet) that is<br>
heated to a temperature above the melting point of the compound to produce a liquid. The<br>
temperature may be maintained above the melting point for an extended time period and,<br>
eventually, cooled to room temperature. If desired, to ensure production of a highly pure<br>
intermetallic compound the above process may be repeated. The resulting intermetallic<br>
compound may be characterized, for example, using x-ray diffraction techniques to determine<br>
the presence of the intermetallic phase.<br>
When used as an electrode material for fuel cells, the intermetallic compound may be<br>
ground to form a high surface area powder. The powder may be embedded in the surface of<br>
an electrically conductive material, such as graphite, to form the electrode. Other<br>
conventional methods of producing powders (e.g., spray pyrolysis) and, particularly, powders<br>
having certain shapes may be employed. Certain shapes may be designed to expose surfaces<br>
having particular crystallographic orientations.<br>
As noted above, the ordered intermetallic compounds of the invention may be used as<br>
catalysts in a number of applications including fuel cells. Fig. 3 schematically shows a fuel<br>
cell 10 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Fuel cell 10 includes an anode<br>
12 and a cathode 14 and an separator 16 therebetween. In the illustrative embodiment, the<br>
anode is formed of a conducting plate 18 that has a plurality of ordered intermetallic particles<br>
20 embedded therein. Particles 20 may be formed of any of the intermetallic compounds<br>
described herein. An external circuit 22 may be electrically connected to the anode and<br>
cathode.<br>
In some cases, separator 16 may be a proton exchange separator. The proton<br>
exchange separator may be any suitable type known in the art. In some cases, the proton<br>
exchange separator is a membrane. In some cases, the proton exchange separator may be a<br>
liquid (e.g., water). The proton exchange separator, for example, may be formed of a<br>
polymeric material or a salt. Proton exchange separators are particularly useful when a<br>
hydrocarbon fuel is being oxidized and/or the reaction is occurring at room temperature or<br>
relatively low temperatures. Such separators also serve to mitigate or completely block the<br>
flow of fuel to the cathode and to keep the fuel and oxidizer (typically oxygen from the air)<br>
separate. In some cases, fuel cell 10 may not include any type of separator, for example, in<br>
certain types of micro-fuel cells.<br>
During use, fuel materials 24 are brought in contact with anode 12, and an oxidizing<br>
gas 26 is brought in contact with the cathode. The fuel is oxidized at the anode in a chemical<br>
reaction which is accelerated by the presence of the intermetallic compound which functions<br>
as a catalyst. The oxidizing gas is reduced at the cathode. The cell generates electricity when<br>
electrons generated in the oxidation reaction at the anode flow through the external circuit to<br>
the cathode where the electrons are consumed in the reduction reaction.<br>
It should be understood that fuel cells of the invention may have any suitable<br>
construction and that the particular construction will depend upon the application. In some<br>
cases, the anode may be formed entirely of an intermetallic compound. In some cases, the<br>
cathode may comprise an intermetallic compound either in solid or particulate form..<br>
Depending on the application, the fuel cell may operate in a number of different temperature<br>
ranges. For example, the fuel cell may operate at relatively high temperatures (e.g., greater<br>
than 200 °C), at lower temperatures (e.g., less than 200 °C, less than 80 °C, etc.), or at about<br>
room temperature (about 20 °C).<br>
In one set of embodiments, the fuel cells of the invention may use fuels having<br>
relatively high concentrations of CO because of the ability of electrodes of the invention to<br>
oxidize fuel, while limiting CO binding to their surfaces, thus preventing the CO poisoning<br>
that would be expected to occur in conventional fuel cells using such fuels. In some of these<br>
embodiments, the fuel cells are hydrogen fuel cells. This advantage of the present invention<br>
is particularly significant in fuel cells that operate at temperatures of 80 degrees C or less. At<br>
these temperatures, CO, when present in hydrogen fuel in relatively high levels (e.g., greater<br>
than about 0.01 mole percent) rapidly adsorbs and sticks to electrode surfaces of conventional<br>
fuel cells. Thus, the maximum output power (and efficiency) of conventional fuel cells using<br>
such fuel rapidly drops to unacceptable levels (e.g., efficiency of less than 5%) soon after<br>
operation (e.g., after about 10 minutes or less) at these operating temperatures. Also, the<br>
maximum output power (and efficiency) of conventional fuel cells when oxidizing hydrogen<br>
that includes relatively high levels of CO (e.g., greater than about 0.01 mole percent) at these<br>
operating temperatures is significantly worse (e.g., less than about 5%) than the maximum<br>
output power (and efficiency) of the same conventional fuel cell operating at the same<br>
conditions when oxidizing hydrogen fuel including relatively low levels of CO (e.g., less than<br>
about 0.0001 mole percent).<br>
As known in the art, the maximum fuel cell output power may be determined by<br>
generating a current-voltage curve for the fuel cell. The output power of a fuel cell, for a<br>
given current and voltage on the curve, may be obtained by multiplying the current and the<br>
voltage. The maximum output power is equal to the maximum value obtained when<br>
multiplying the respective fuel cell currents and voltages on the curve.<br>
Fuel cells of the present invention are capable of oxidizing hydrogen fuel including<br>
relatively high levels of CO (e.g., greater than about 0.01 mole percent) with a maximum<br>
output power (and efficiency) that is comparable to when oxidizing hydrogen fuel including<br>
relatively low levels of CO (e.g., less than about 0.0001 mole percent) under the same<br>
conditions, even at low operating temperatures of 80 degrees C or less. For example, the<br>
maximum power (and efficiency )of a fuel cell using hydrogen fuel including relatively high<br>
levels of CO may be at least 20% that when using hydrogen fuel including relatively low<br>
levels of CO when operating for at least 30 minutes (i.e., substantially steady-state condition)<br>
under the same conditions including a temperature of 80 degrees C or less. In other cases, the<br>
maximum output power (and efficiency) when oxidizing relatively high levels of CO may be<br>
at least 50%, or even at least 90%, that when using hydrogen fuel including relatively low<br>
levels of CO relatively low levels of CO when operating for at least 30 minutes (i.e.,<br>
substantially steady-state condition) under the same conditions including a temperature of 80<br>
degrees C or less.<br>
The maximum output power (and efficiencies) described above are also achievable<br>
when the level of CO is significantly higher than 0.01 mole percent, such as greater man<br>
about 0.2 mole percent, greater than about 1.0 mole percent, greater than about 30 mole<br>
percent, or even higher. Therefore, fuel cells of the present invention may advantageously<br>
oxidize hydrogen fuel that has been produced in a reformer, which typically has CO levels of<br>
between about 3 and about 10 mole percent, without the need for further operating steps that<br>
reduce CO levels. The elimination of the processing steps that reduce CO concentration can<br>
lead to significant advantages because of the cost, time and complexity associated with such<br>
steps.<br>
The fuel cells of the invention are also capable of oxidizing hydrogen fuel including relatively high levels of CO (e.g., greater than about 0.01 mole percent) at high current<br>
densities for an extended time period after the start of the oxidation step (e.g., at least about<br>
30 minutes), even at low operating temperatures of 80 degrees C or less. For example.,<br>
hydrogen fuel cells of the invention may be capable of oxidizing hydrogen fuel including<br>
greater than about 0.01 mole percent carbon monoxide, when operating for at least 30<br>
minutes at a temperature of 80 degrees C or less, at a current density per unit surface area of<br>
the cathode of at least about 0.05 Amp/sq. cm. In some cases, significantly higher current<br>
densities per unit surface area of cathode are achievable under these conditions such as at<br>
least about 0.1 Amp/sq. cm and at least about 1.0 Amp/sq. cm.<br>
Hydrogen fuel cells of the present invention may maintain their maximum output<br>
power (and efficiency) at relatively high levels over extended periods of time at low<br>
operating temperatures, even when relatively high levels of CO are present in the hydrogen<br>
fuel. For example, fuel cells may oxidize hydrogen fuel including greater than about 0.01<br>
mole percent carbon monoxide at temperatures of 80 degrees C or less such that the<br>
maximum output power (and efficiency) after 30 minutes of operation is at least about 20%<br>
the initial maximum output power (i.e., the maximum output power at the start of oxidation)<br>
(and efficiency). La some cases, the maximum output power (and efficiency) after 30 minutes<br>
of operation are significantly higher, such at least about 50% or at least about 90% the initial<br>
maximum output power (and efficiency).<br>
It should be understood that fuel cells of the present invention may also oxidize<br>
hydrogen fuel including relatively high levels of CO at higher temperatures (e.g., greater than<br>
80 degrees C) with the above noted advantages. In general, oxidizing hydrogen fuel at higher<br>
temperatures reduces effects of CO poisoning in conventional fuel cells and fuel cells of the<br>
invention.<br>
In some embodiments, the fuel cells of the invention may use fuels (e.g., hydrogen)<br>
having relatively high concentrations of sulfur because of the ability of electrodes of the<br>
invention to oxidize fuel, while limiting the binding of sulfur to their surfaces. For example,<br>
the fuel cells of the invention may use fuels having at least about 0.0001 mole percent sulfur.<br>
This prevention of sulfur poisoning, which generally occurs in conventional fuel cells when<br>
using fuels with high sulfur concentrations (e.g. greater than about 0.00001 mole percent),<br>
may allow processing steps that reduce sulfur concentration to be eliminated when producing<br>
fuel for use in fuel cells of the present invention. This can lead to significant cost and<br>
processing advantages.<br>
Intermetallic compounds may also be used as catalysts in fuel reformers. Fuel:<br>
reformers can be used to convert hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based compounds, and<br>
mixtures thereof, to lighter fuels such as methane or hydrogen. The reformed fuel, such as<br>
hydrogen, can then be fed to a fuel cell for oxidation and electricity production. Fuel<br>
reformers, such as the one illustrated schematically in Fig. 11 may include an inlet 101 for<br>
receiving a hydrocarbon base stock and an outlet 102 for dispensing a reformate, such as<br>
hydrogen. The hydrocarbon base stock may be mixed with air and/or steam, for examples,<br>
prior to entering the catalyst bed 103. The catalyst bed 103 is positioned so that the<br>
hydrocarbon base stock passes over the catalyst where it can be reformed to a lighter fuel<br>
such as hydrogen. The catalyst bed may be in any form known to those skilled in the art, such<br>
as, for examples, a granular powder, coated beads, or a coated ceramic monolith. A fuel<br>
reformer using a catalyst that includes one or more intermetallic compounds may be less<br>
susceptible to poisoning and may provide greater conversion efficiency of the fuel. A<br>
reformer catalyst including an ordered intermetallic compound, as disclosed herein, may be<br>
used with a feedstock mix of lower purity than other conventional catalysts.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples, which are<br>
intended to be illustrative in nature and are not to be considered as limiting the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example illustrates the improved performance of an electrode formed from an<br>
ordered intermetallic compound (BiPt) according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
and, in some cases, compares the performance to a conventional solid metal electrode.<br>
Sample Preparation and Experimental System<br>
A BiPt ordered intermetallic compound was prepared using the following procedure.<br>
Platinum powder (Johnson Matthey 99.999%) was mixed with bismuth powder from pellets<br>
(Alfa Aesar, 99.9999%) in a 1:1 molar ratio to obtain a 1.5 gram mixture. The mixture was<br>
thoroughly mixed using an agate mortar and pellets (6 mm O.D., 4 mm length) were pressed<br>
using a hydraulic press and a force of 3500 pounds. The pellets were sealed in evacuated<br>
fused silica tubes (10 mm I.D., 10 cm length) and placed upright in a box furnace. The tubes<br>
were heated at 800 °C for 24 hours and annealed at 650 °C for 48 hours. The pellets were<br>
ground to form a powder mixture which was mixed, pressed into pellets, and heated a second<br>
time following the same procedure described above.<br>
The pellets were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (Scintag XDS2000<br>
equipped with an energy sensitive detector, Cu K-alpha radiation) which indicated the<br>
presence of a single phase BiPt32 (P63/mmc, a = 4.315 Angstroms, c = 5.490 Angstroms)<br>
The resulting pellets were cut into cylinders (3 mm length) which were press-fitted<br>
into Teflon rods to form an electrode structure. Electrical contact was made through a<br>
graphite felt plug, which was, in turn, connected to a stainless steel holder. The plug could be<br>
connected to the rotating arbor of a Pine electrode rotator. Contact resistances between the<br>
stainless steel holder and the surface of the electrode were typically on the order of 3-4 ohms.<br>
Once mounted, the electrode surfaces were polished with 400 and 600 grid emery paper<br>
(Buehler) followed by a 1 micron diamond paste (Buehler) to a mirror finish.<br>
Pure platinum electrodes were formed using the above-described platinum powder<br>
and following a similar procedure.<br>
Prior to each experiment, electrodes were polished with the 1 micron diamond paste,<br>
rinsed with Millipore water (Millipore Milli-Q) and placed in an ultrasound bath for 10<br>
minutes.<br>
All the solutions used in the experiment were prepared with Millipore water. 0.1 M<br>
sulfuric acid (J.T. Baker - Ultrapure Reagent) solutions were used as supporting electrolyte.<br>
Formic acid (Fisher Chemical, 88% Certified ACS) was used. All solutions were deaerated<br>
with nitrogen for at least 15 minutes and measurements were conducted at room temperature.<br>
Carbon Monoxide (Matheson Air Products), CP Grade, was used.<br>
An electrochemical setup similar to the one described in Smith, S. P.E.; Abruna, H.D.<br>
Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 1998 102,3506 was used. All potentials are referenced to a<br>
saturated Ag/AgCl electrode without regard for the liquid junction. Differential<br>
electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) was used to determine the production of CO and<br>
CO2 from the oxidation of formic acid on the BiPt and bare Pt electrode surfaces. The<br>
ionization chamber used in the DEMS experiments was pumped by a Varian 2501/s<br>
turbomolecular pump, which was backed by a Varian Triscroll dry pump in order to avoid<br>
contamination from oil vapors. Due to the high pressure in the ionization chamber during the<br>
electrochemical experiments, a Pfeiffer 65 1/s turbomolecular pump backed by a Pfeiffer dry<br>
diaphragm pump differentially pumped the mass spectrometer analysis chamber. The<br>
chamber was isolated from the ionization chamber through a pressure converter (Leybold<br>
Inficon DPC2A). The quadrupole mass spectrometer (Leybold Inficon Transpector H-100M)<br>
was connected to the analysis chamber and contained a Channeltron electron<br>
multiplier/faraday cup detector. The very short delay times allowed the measurement of the<br>
mass intensity of the products as a function of potential by slowly sweeping the potential (2<br>
mV/sec).<br>
Voltammetrv in 0.1 M H2SO4<br>
Voltammetry measurements were obtained for the Pt electrode and the ordered<br>
intermetallic BiPt electrode in 0.1 M H2SO4. Fig. 4 shows the results for both samples. The<br>
Pt electrode shows its characteristic profile (A) including oxide formation and reduction<br>
peaks, as well as hydrogen adsorption waves. The BiPt intermetallic electrode profile (B)<br>
also shows oxide formation and reduction peaks, as well as a small wave at about - 0.2 V<br>
which may suggest weak hydrogen adsorption.<br>
The surface oxide formation and reduction peaks in BiPt profile are shifted negative<br>
as compared to Pt profile indicating the formation/reduction of surfaces oxides at lower<br>
potentials using BiPt electrodes. The BiPt electrode also had a significantly higher current<br>
density as compared to the Pt electrode.<br>
Formic Acid Oxidation<br>
Fig. 5 shows the voltammetric profile for formic acid oxidation on the Pt and BiPt<br>
electrode surfaces.<br>
The Pt profile is consistent with known data and has an onset potential on the first<br>
anodic sweep of about +0.2 V. The current significantly increases in the cathodic sweep with<br>
a well defined hysteresis as a result of poisoning effects by CO and upon oxidation of the<br>
adsorbed CO.<br>
The BiPt profile shows an onset potential of about -120 mV and reaches an apparent<br>
steady-state current (of ca. 5 mA/cm2) at about +0.10 V. Scanning to more positive potentials<br>
results in an additional peak (peak II) followed by a decrease in current, presumably due to<br>
small CO poisoning effects. On the subsequent cathodic sweep there is a sharp peak (peak<br>
III) that decays as more negative potentials are reached. If the potential scan is limited to<br>
-0.20 V to +0.20 V the forward and reverse scan are virtually super-imposable. This suggests<br>
limited CO poisoning effects associated with the BiPt electrode.<br>
A number of observations may be made from a comparison of the Pt profile and BiPt<br>
profile.<br>
First, the current density at the BiPt electrode is dramatically higher than that for the<br>
Pt electrode. This is believed to be from a difference in activities between the two electrodes,<br>
but also may be due to difference in the microscopic electrode areas.<br>
Second, the onset potential for formic acid oxidation is shifted negatively by over 300<br>
mV for the BiPt electrode. In order to further study this dramatic advantage of the BiPt<br>
electrode, the onset potential for formic acid oxidation was measured as a function of its bulk<br>
concentration (Fig. 6). In these studies, the onset potential was taken as that at which the<br>
current reached 10 microAmps. Although the choice of the current magnitude was arbitrary,<br>
it does provide an estimate of the limiting value. In these studies the electrode was rotated at<br>
3000 rpm in order to minimize the blockage of the electrode surface from gas (ostensibly<br>
CO2 bubbles formed). In addition, the potential was swept slowly; typically at a rate of 10<br>
mV/s.<br>
As seen in Fig. 6, initially, the onset potential increases approximately linearly with<br>
formic acid concentration. At higher formic acid concentrations, there is less dependence.<br>
At the highest concentration examined, the onset potential for formic acid oxidation<br>
asymptotically reaches a value of ca. -0.13 V. As discussed above, this represents a dramatic<br>
improvement over the Pt electrode, with a difference of over 300 mV.<br>
CO Poisoning<br>
As discussed above, one disadvantage of using platinum as an electrocatalyst in fuel<br>
cell applications is its high propensity to poisoning by CO. In order to assess the<br>
susceptibility of BiPt to CO poisoning we carried out studies in sulfuric acid solution<br>
saturated with CO and compared the results to those on Pt.<br>
Fig. 7A shows the voltammetric profile for a Pt surface before exposure to CO and<br>
Fig. 7B shows the voltammetric profile for a Pt surface after exposure to CO. The results<br>
show that exposure to CO resulted in a rapid and irreversible adsorption by CO. As shown in<br>
Fig. 7A, the surface is strongly passivated to the point where there is essentially no current up<br>
to about +0.60V where there is a sharp peak ascribed to the oxidation of adsorbed CO to CO2.<br>
Fig. 7C shows the voltammetric profile for a BiPt surface before and after exposure to<br>
CO. As shown in Fig. 7C, the voltammetric profiles are qualitatively very similar with a<br>
slight enhancement of peak b in the anodic sweep. It is believed that the slight enhancement may be due to both oxidation of CO to CO2 as well as desorption of adsorbed CO. Peak C<br>
remained essentially unchanged. The results show that insignificant amounts, if any, of CO<br>
adsorbed to the BiPt surface.<br>
These results indicate that CO has a much lower affinity towards the BiPt surface as<br>
compared to Pt. Thus, significantly less CO poisoning is found in BiPt electrodes. It is believed that the dramatic drop in the affinity of CO for BiPt is a direct consequence of its<br>
structure and, in particular, the difference in Pt-Pt interatomic distance in Pt versus the Pt-Pt<br>
distance in BiPt. In Pt, the Pt-Pt interatomic distance is 2.77 Angstroms; while in BiPt, the<br>
Pt-Pt interatomic distance is increased to 4.3 Angstroms (see Figs. 8A and 8B). It is believed<br>
that the larger interatomic distances in BiPt make it very difficult for CO to bond to BiPt<br>
surfaces in a bridge site configuration, thus decreasing its bonding affinity.<br>
Kinetic Studies<br>
In order to examine the kinetics of formic acid oxidation at a BiPt electrode surface,<br>
rotated disk electrode experiments were carried out. In these studies the potential was swept<br>
(at 10 mV/sec) from -0.20 V to +0.25 V; the region that is of interest in certain fuel cell<br>
applications. It should also be mentioned that due a significant gas evolution (ostensibly<br>
CO2) the surface might be partially covered (especially at the slower rates of rotation).<br>
The inset to Fig. 9 shows a Levich plot (iL vs. (rps)1/2) for the oxidation of formic acid<br>
at the BiPt electrode. In these experiments, the limiting current was measured at +0.20 V.<br>
As seen on the inset, the plot exhibits significant curvature, suggesting a reaction that is<br>
kinetically and not transport limited.<br>
For a system that is kinetically controlled, theory predicts that a Koutecky-Levich plot<br>
(1/iL vs. l/(rps)l/2) should be linear and from the intercept the value of the rate constant can<br>
be obtained. The main panel of Fig. 9 shows a linear Koutecky-Levich plot. From the<br>
intercept, a value of 1.4 x 10-4 cm/s was obtained for the rate constant. This value is<br>
comparable to values obtained for various Pt surfaces under conditions that were intended to<br>
minimize poisoning by CO, as well as surface blocking from CO2 evolution as described in<br>
Smith, S.P.E.; Ben-Dor, K.F.; Abruna, H.D. Langmuir, 1999,15,7325.<br>
As discussed above, it is believed that the surface of the BiPt electrode is partially<br>
blocked by the evolution of CO2. Thus, the value presented above likely represents a lower<br>
limit. In addition, the fact that it is comparable to platinum (even when the surface is partially<br>
blocked), attests to its electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, as discussed above, the onset<br>
potential is significantly shifted to less negative values and the surfaces appear to be<br>
relatively immune and/or tolerant to CO. All of these attributes clearly make BiPt a superior<br>
electrocatalyst for formic acid oxidation.<br>
DEMS Studies<br>
DEMS experiments were conducted to characterize the products from the<br>
electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid using a BiPt electrode. DEMS allows for the<br>
detection of the (neutral) products of electrochemical reactions in real time. In these<br>
experiments, the potential applied to the BiPt electrode was varied at a slow scan rate (2<br>
mV/sec), while the ion intensities at mass values of 28 and 44 corresponding to CO (as well<br>
as N2) and CO2, respectively, were monitored.<br>
Fig. lOA shows the cyclic voltammetric profile (at 2 mV/sec) for the oxidation of<br>
formic acid at a BiPt electrode over the potential range of-0.2 to 1.0 V. Figs. 10B and 10C<br>
show the ion current intensities corresponding to CO2 and CO respectively. It is clear that the<br>
oxidation of formic acid gives rise to the generation of both CO2 and CO and that there is a<br>
clear correspondence between the voltammetric profile in Fig. 10A and the profiles for the<br>
ion current intensities. The fact that both CO2 and CO are generated would suggest that the<br>
dual path mechanism for formic acid oxidation is operating at the BiPt surface. In addition,<br>
the detection of CO also indicates that it is not strongly bound to the BiPt surface.<br>
Discussion<br>
The results obtained in these studies indicate that the BiPt ordered intermetallic phase<br>
has properties and reactivities that are dramatically different from those of bare platinum<br>
surfaces, with regards to formic acid oxidation. The onset potential for the electrocatalytic<br>
oxidation of formic acid on BiPt is significantly shifted (by over 300 mV) to more negative<br>
values as compared to Pt. The current density (at a given potential) is significantly increased<br>
for BiPt when compared to bare platinum. Finally, the BiPt surface appears to have a<br>
dramatically lower sensitivity to poisoning by CO.<br>
The differences between Pt and BiPt are ascribed to both electronic and geometric<br>
effects. It is believed that the shift in onset potential and increase in current density are<br>
dominated by electronic effects. It is believed that formation of the BiPt ordered<br>
intermetallic results in a charge redistribution (as a first approximation arising from the work<br>
function differences), which enhances the affinity of BiPt towards formic acid, and further<br>
gives rise to the formation of surface oxides at lower potentials. These two effects combine to<br>
give rise to the enhanced performance observed. In addition, these effects are consistent with<br>
the generally accepted concept that, in these types of systems, the catalytic performance<br>
comes as the result of a combination of enhanced activation and the presence of surface<br>
oxides at low potentials.<br>
In terms of geometric effects, it is believed that the greatly reduced propensity of BiPt<br>
towards poisoning by CO (relative to Pt) arises to a significant extent as a result of the<br>
increased Pt-Pt distance in BiPt (Pt-Pt = 4.3 A), (Fig. 1) in relation to Pt (2.77), (Fig. 8).<br>
However, it is also possible that electronic effects are involved.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The activity of the BiPt ordered intermetallic phase towards the electrocatalytic<br>
oxidation of formic acid has been investigated and the results compared to those on platinum.<br>
Relative to platinum, BiPt exhibits a greatly enhanced performance in terms of the current<br>
density and the onset potential. Moreover, BiPt was virtually immune to poisoning effects by<br>
CO. These factors suggest that BiPt is a superior material than pt for electrocatalytic<br>
oxidation of formic acid.<br>
It is believed that the enhanced performance of the ordered intermetallic phase is due to<br>
electronic and geometric factors. It is believed that the current enhancement and onset<br>
potential are most influenced by electronic effects, whereas the immunity to CO poisoning is<br>
largely controlled by the geometric/structural factors.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example illustrates the improved performance of electrodes formed from a<br>
number of different ordered intermetallic compounds and, in some cases, compares the<br>
performance to a conventional solid metal electrode.<br>
Sample Preparation and Experimental System<br>
PtBi2, PtPb, PtIn, PtIn2, Pt3In7, PtSn2, PtSm, PtSb, PdBi, and PdSb intermetallic<br>
compounds were prepared using the following procedure. Stoichiometric amounts of<br>
platinum or palladium powder and powder of the appropriate second metal were sealed under<br>
vacuum in a silica tube. The samples were then heated (see Table 1 for temperatures) in a<br>
box furnace and held for from nine to twelve hours at that temperature before quenching to<br>
room temperature. Samples that exhibit peritectic decomposition typically needed to be<br>
annealed below the peritectic temperature for up to several days to achieve reasonable phase<br>
purity.<br>
The samples were then ground in an agate mortar and pestle, and XKD powder<br>
patterns were taken to confirm the composition and structure of the intermetallic phase. The<br>
procedure was repeated, without grinding, to cast the samples into suitable bulk electrodes.<br>
In order to eliminate porosity, the molten samples were periodically shaken to remove<br>
trapped gases.<br>
PtMn, Pt3Sn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn and PtSb2 intermetallic compounds were prepared using the<br>
following procedure. Stoichiometric amounts of platinum powder and powder of the<br>
appropriate second metal were pressed into a pellet in a pellet press and subsequently arc-<br>
melted, forming a metallic button. Samples that exhibit peritectic decomposition typically<br>
needed to be annealed below the peritectic temperature for up to several days to achieve<br>
phase purity. These buttons were then cast into cylindrical slugs in graphite crucibles in an<br>
RF furnace. The samples were ground in an agate mortar and pestle, and XRD powder<br>
patterns were taken to confirm the composition of the intermetallic phase. The procedure<br>
was repeated, without grinding, to cast the sample into a suitable bulk electrode.<br>
In most cases, the resulting pellets were cut into cylinders of ca. 3-5 mm in length and<br>
either 3 or 7 mm in diameter. The cylinders were press-fitted into Teflon rods to form an<br>
electrode structure. Electrical contact was made through a graphite felt plug which was, in<br>
turn, connected to a stainless steel holder. The plug could be connected to the rotating arbor<br>
of a Pine electrode rotator. Contact resistances between the stainless steel holder and the<br>
surface of the electrode were typically on the order of 3-4 ohms.<br>
In cases where it was not possible to produce a cylindrical sample, the irregularly-<br>
shaped samples were polished (as described further below) and then connected to a platinum<br>
or silver wire with tin solder (this connection was subsequently covered with Teflon tape).<br>
For these electrodes, the contact resistance was less than 0.5 ohms and the electrochemical<br>
studies were performed using the hanging meniscus technique.<br>
Prior to each experiment, electrodes were polished with diamond paste (METADI-<br>
Buehler, ø = lum) and rinsed with Millipore water (leMOcm-1, Millipore Milli-Q). In most<br>
cases after polishing with diamond paste, the electrodes were cycled in the supporting<br>
electrolyte over a potential range where there was no evidence of decomposition processes<br>
until a stable cyclic voltammogram was obtained (~10 min at 50 or 10 mV/s) prior to the<br>
oxidation of the fuel. All the solutions were prepared with Millipore water. Solutions of 0.1<br>
M sulfuric acid (J.T. Baker-Ultrapure Reagent) were used as the supporting electrolyte in<br>
some cases. In other cases, perchloric acid (Aldrich Chemical Company Inc. - HClO4<br>
Redistilled 99.999% HClO4 content 69.0-72.0%) was used as the supporting electrolyte<br>
instead of sulfuric acid. Formic acid (Fisher Chemical, 88% Certified ACS), methanol<br>
(Mallinckrodt Analytical Reagent, Anhydrous Meets ACS Specifications 99.9%), ethanol<br>
(Pharmaco Products Inc. 200 proof ACS/USP Grade), ethylene glycol (Mallinckrodt<br>
Analytical Reagent, Acidity 0.001%) and acetic acid (Alfa Aesar - Johnson Matthey, Glacial<br>
99.9985%) were added (as received) to obtain fuel concentrations of 0.1 to 0.5 M. All<br>
solutions were deaerated with pre-purified nitrogen for at least 10 minutes and measurements<br>
were conducted-at room temperature. All potentials are referenced to a saturated Ag/AgCl<br>
electrode without regard for the liquid junction.<br>
Results: Oxidation of the electrode surface<br>
A number of electrodes were tested in sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Figs. 12A and 12B<br>
respectively show the cyclic voltammograms obtained for a conventional pure Pt electrode<br>
and a PtPb electrode in a 0.1 M sulfuric acid solution. Fig. 12A shows the characteristic<br>
voltammetric profile for Pt with hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks, as well as well-<br>
defined surface oxidation and reduction peaks (onset of oxidation at +0.56 V). In contrast,<br>
Fig. 12B shows very little, if any, evidence of hydrogen adsorption/desorption for the PtPb<br>
intermetallic compound.<br>
Both profiles exhibited an oxidation wave in the potential range of +0.4 V to +0.6 V,<br>
which has been ascribed to surface oxide formation. The onset of surface oxidation tended to<br>
be shifted negative in the intermetallics compounds compared to that of pure Pt. Because it is<br>
widely believed that the presence of oxygenated species at the surface is critical to the<br>
oxidation of candidate fuels, these shifts are noteworthy and are summarized in Table 2.<br>
A number of other electrode materials were tested in O.IM HClO4. The choice of acid<br>
used as electrolyte was guided by the stability of the intermetallic in each acid. For instance,<br>
it was found that PtIn was unstable in H2SO4 at positive potentials and was thus studied in<br>
HClO4, Pt3In7, PtSn2 and PtSfy were determined to continuously corrode in both sulfuric<br>
acid and perchloric acid and were not studied further. Electrode stability appeared to be<br>
enhanced by high Pt content Pt, as particularly Pt-poor materials such as these readily<br>
dissolved at any potential. It is not known whether this effect was primarily driven by overall<br>
Pt content, or by dilated nearest neighbor Pt-Pt distances.<br>
Figs. 13A-13C respectively shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained for pure Pt<br>
electrode, PtBi electrode (prepared following the procedure in Example 1), and a PtIn<br>
electrode in a 0.1 M perchloric acid solution. The Pt electrode (Fig. 13A) showed the<br>
characteristic well-defined surface oxidation and hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks. The<br>
profiles for the intermetallic compounds (PtBi, Figure 2b; PtIn, Figure 2c) had fewer features,<br>
lacking strong indication of hydrogen adsorption, and with far broader surface oxidation<br>
peaks. Data is summarized in Table 3.<br>
While the Sn-containing intermetallics displayed a dramatic negative shift in the onset<br>
of surface oxidation potential, these peaks were quite poorly defined, and partially obscured<br>
by a large ohmic current; thus the above values for these intermetallic compounds are<br>
presented with caution.<br>
Formic acid oxidation<br>
It is considered that formic acid may be used as an effective initial screen for<br>
candidate electrode materials. Mechanistically, formic acid can act as a model system for<br>
more complex oxidation pathways, such as those for ethanol and for methanol. For<br>
methanol, the catalyst must provide an additional oxygen atom to each fuel molecule, in<br>
addition to catalyzing dehydrogenation, to produce CO2 For ethanol a catalyst must also<br>
break the C-C bond, to produce two CO2 molecules from each ethanol molecule. Unlike<br>
those fuels, for formic acid oxidation, C-C bond cleavage is not necessary nor does additional<br>
oxygen need to be provided to generate CO2. Thus, it is believed than any electrode that is<br>
active for either methanol or ethanol should show pronounced electrocatalytic activity for<br>
formic acid oxidation.<br>
Fig. 14A-14C depict representative cyclic voltammograms for PtIn (Fig. 14A), PtPb<br>
(Fig. 14B), and PtSn (Fig. 14C), all of which exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for the<br>
oxidation of formic acid. The PtIn2, PtSb2, PdBi and PdSb electrodes were also tested but<br>
were found to exhibit relatively low electrocatalytic activity toward formic acid oxidation,<br>
and thus are not shown. In fact, these materials were also found to be exhibit relatively low<br>
electrocatalytic activity toward other fuels tested (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and<br>
acetic acid), thus supporting the contention that formic acid can be a useful screen. PtIn2 and<br>
PtSb2 have nearest Pt-Pt distances of 4.501 Angstrom and 4.555 Angstrom, respectively, so<br>
these findings suggest Pt is necessary and having at least some Pt-Pt distances greater than<br>
2.77 Angstrom (nearest neighbor distance between Pt-Pt atoms in Pt) may be advantageous<br>
for the materials to be active to fuel oxidation. Results for electrodes active toward formic<br>
acid oxidation are summarized in Table 4, noting that all values refer only to the anodic<br>
sweep of each CV.<br>
Of the materials tested, PtBi, PtBi2, PtPb, and PtIn showed the most promising results<br>
in formic acid. Upon cycling, each produced bubbles concomitant with the onset of anodic<br>
current, suggesting that formic acid was completely oxidized to CO2. In fact, PtPb showed an<br>
onset of oxidation potential of approximately 300 mV less positive than pure Pt. While all<br>
current densities reported herein were calculated with respect to geometric surface area, and<br>
there was likely some degree of roughness associated with each electrode, all materials<br>
displayed a mirror finish upon polishing, which was still evident after cycling. Thus, it was<br>
highly unlikely that the enhanced current densities displayed by a number of the intermetallic<br>
electrodes (a factor of 40, in the case of PtPb) were primarily due to surface area<br>
discrepancies, but rather to significant increases in specific activity. In fact, the Pt electrode<br>
used for comparison was prepared and cleaned using the same procedure that was used for<br>
the intermetallic electrodes, and hence it likely had comparable surface roughness.<br>
Methanol oxidation<br>
Each intermetallic compound was tested as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation.<br>
Figs. 15A-15C presents the cyclic voltammograms of PtIn (Fig. 15A), PtPb (Fig. 15B), and<br>
PtSn (Fig. 15C), all of which were active towards the oxidation of methanol. The PtBi, PtBi2,<br>
PtMn, Pt2Sn3, and Pt3Sn ordered intermetallic phases, which all exhibited varying levels of<br>
activity toward formic acid oxidation, did not exhibit significant activity towards methanol to<br>
electro-oxidation. Results of the initial anodic sweeps for the materials studied in the<br>
activation of methanol are summarized in Table 5. Not surprisingly, all active electrodes<br>
showed a significant positive shift in onset of oxidation relative to that of formic acid,<br>
reflecting the expected difficulty in oxidizing methanol compared to formic acid. In this<br>
case, the catalyst must provide oxygen to the fuel to generate CO2, in addition to<br>
dehydrogenating the fuel. However, a number of these intermetallic phases demonstrated<br>
enhanced activity when compared to pure Pt. For example, PtPb had an onset of oxidation<br>
potential 100 mV less positive man Pt. The PtIn and PtPb electrodes also displayed high<br>
current densities, similar to the values they displayed for formic acid oxidation. The current<br>
density of PtIn was approximately 3 times that of pure Pt, while PtPb had a current density<br>
more than 40 times as great as Pt.<br>
Ethanol and acetic acid oxidation<br>
Each intermetallic compound was tested as an electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation.<br>
The PtBi2, Pt2Sn3, and Pt3Sn intermetallic phases were found to exhibit non-significant<br>
activity towards ethanol oxidation. However, both PtBi and PtMn, which exhibited non-<br>
significant activity towards methanol oxidation, exhibited significant ability to oxidize<br>
ethanol.<br>
Representative cyclic voltammograms for PtBi (Fig. 16A; prepared in Example 1),<br>
PtIn (Fig. 16B), and PtPb (Fig. 16C) are shown in Figure 5, and the results from active<br>
materials are summarized in Table 6. While measurements of peak current were limited to<br>
the oxidation wave at ca. 0.6 V for each material, a second oxidation wave was visible at<br>
between 1.0 and 1.1 V. It is believed that none of these materials oxidized ethanol<br>
completely to CO2 at low potentials, instead generating only intermediates (likely including<br>
acetic acid) as C-C bond cleavage is likely the most mechanistically difficult step.<br>
To explore this hypothesis, all electrodes were tested for activity toward acetic acid<br>
oxidation. Figs. 17A and 17B respectively show cyclic voltammograms for PtIn and PtPb.<br>
None of these materials (including pure Pt) exhibited significant activity towards the<br>
oxidation of acetic acid, supporting the hypothesis. Of all electrodes tested, PtPb shows both<br>
a greater negative shift in onset of oxidation potential and a significantly higher current<br>
density, both compared to pure Pt.<br>
Ethylene Glycol Oxidation<br>
The electrode materials were tested with ethylene glycol as a potential fuel for<br>
electro-oxidation. Figs. 18A-C show the cyclic voltammograms for PtBi (Fig. 18A; prepared<br>
in Example 1), PtIn (Fig. 18B), and PtPb (Fig. 18C), all of which were active in the oxidation<br>
of ethylene glycol. PtBi2, Pt2Sn3, Pt3Sn and PtMn exhibited relatively little activity. The<br>
results are summarized in Table 7. As previously seen for other fuels, each active<br>
intermetallic material displayed both enhanced current densities and improved onset of<br>
oxidation potentials when compared to pure Pt. In particular, PtPb showed a 110 mV<br>
negative shift in the oxidation wave and a current density six times that of Pt. As with<br>
ethanol, however, it was unclear that for any of these materials the fuel was completely<br>
oxidized to CO2 until significantly more positive potentials than shown above, or if a partially<br>
oxidized species were generated. Preliminary differential electrochemical mass<br>
spectrometry, DEMS, results (unpublished) for the oxidation of ethylene glycol on PtBi<br>
indicate that the latter might be true, since no CO nor CO2 was detected.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The electrocatalytic activities of a wide range of ordered intermetallic compounds<br>
toward a variety of potential fuels have been studied, and results have been compared to those<br>
of a pure Pt electrode, prepared in an identical manner. A significant number of the ordered<br>
intermetallic phases showed electrocatalytic activity far superior to that of pure Pt in terms of<br>
both potential of onset of oxidation and current density.<br>
Pt-containing intermetallic compounds, in particular, may exhibit high electrocatalytic<br>
activities toward a number of fuels. This finding is not surprising, because, of all elements,<br>
Pt excels at catalysis of dissociative chemisorption of SOMs (small organic molecules),<br>
which is believed to be the initial step in electroxidation. For each element tested in multiple<br>
phases (Bi, In, Sn, Sb), the one-to-one stoichiometric phase (in most cases, a NiAs structure)<br>
displayed the highest activity in terms of onset potential, current density, and types of fuel<br>
oxidized. Electrode stability appeared to be enhanced by the presence Pt, as particularly Pt-<br>
poor materials (PtSn2, PtSiu, Pt3In7) readily dissolved at any potential, though it is too soon to<br>
conclude whether this effect was primarily driven by overall Pt content, or by dilated nearest<br>
neighbor Pt-Pt distances. PtIn2 and PtSb2 were both relatively inactive and have nearest Pt-Pt<br>
distances of 4.501A and 4.555 A, respectively. Most active phases have nearest neighbor Pt-<br>
Pt of approximately 2.8 A along one axis and of greater than 4 A in any other direction, and<br>
these dilated Pt-Pt distances may be the source of higher resistance to poisoning.<br>
The contention that formic acid can serve as a model fuel for candidate materials is<br>
now well-founded, as no material relatively inactive to formic acid showed any activity<br>
toward any other fuel tested, and formic acid can be used with confidence as an initial screen<br>
for new active intermetallic phases.<br>
In summary, ordered intermetallic phases afford enough control of surface<br>
characteristics to tailor a substrate to enhance C-C bond cleavage so as to make ethanol and<br>
other C-2 SOMs viable fuels for fuel cell applications.<br>
Summary of Results<br>
The following table (Table 8) summarizes the results of the experiments described<br>
above.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The poisoning effects of thiophene (a representative sulfur containing material) was<br>
examined on Pt and PtPb intermetallic compound electrodes. In these experiments, the<br>
electrodes (Pt, PtPb) were in contact with a 0.5M solution of formic acid in 0.1M sulfuric<br>
acid. An initial potential of -0.3 volts was applied and then changed to +0.3; a value where<br>
formic acid is oxidized at both electrodes. After the current had stabilized, (after 1700 sec.)<br>
50 µL of a solution of thiophene in ethanol were added so that the thiophene concentration<br>
was 8.5 ppm (parts per million).<br>
Fig. 19A shows a precipitous drop of the current to essentially background levels in a<br>
very short time period for the Pt electrode.<br>
Fig. 19B shows a slow, initial drop of about 30% and maintenance of a stable current<br>
at about 70% of the level present prior to the injection of thiophene for the PtPb electrode.<br>
The results suggest that the PtPb retains a high degree (70%) of activity even in the<br>
presence of high concentrations of sulfur-containing materials.<br>
It should be understood that although particular embodiments and examples of the<br>

modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
