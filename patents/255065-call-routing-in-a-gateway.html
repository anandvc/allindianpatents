COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"EXTENDING MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS"<br>
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a corporation of the State of Washington<br>
having a place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington<br>
98052, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
l<br>
EXTENDING MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to mobile phone networks. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to methods, systems, and computer program products for<br>
bridging mobile phone networks with other telephone networks.<br>
Background and Related Art<br>
Cellular phones are becoming increasing popular. Initially, size, cost, and<br>
geographic coverage limited most cellular phone use to a business context. Eariy<br>
cellular phones frequently were referred to as "bricks," due to their bulk and<br>
inconvenience. Professionals and technicians with on-call responsibilities were the<br>
typical cellular phone user. In many circumstances, numeric and text pagers provided<br>
an economical and convenient alternative to early cellular phones.<br>
Today's cellular phones are compact enough to fit in a user's pocket, have<br>
purchase and monthly service costs similar to traditional telephones, and offer local,<br>
regional, and national coverage. Often, a single household will have multiple cellular<br>
phones. With the increasing popularity of cellular phones, some are beginning to<br>
realize that a separate home or office phone may not be necessary. Over the next five<br>
yeats, it is estimated. that up to. 30% of landlines ia homes wilt be disconnected. and<br>
users will depend solely on cellular phone service.<br>
As consiimers begin to make the transition from home or office landlines to<br>
exclusive (or principle) cellular use, they are likely to encounter some loss of<br>
convenience. For example, a cellular phone can only be located in a single place at<br>
once. In particular, user' s often charge their cellular phone in the evening so they will<br>
be ready for use the next day. Accordingly, users generally do not or cannot carry<br>
their cellular phone around with them while at home in the evening. Of course, even<br>
if a user elects to carry the cellular phone around while awake, the phone may be<br>
inadvertently left in one room when the user moves to another room, making it<br>
difficult to locate the cellular phone when it rings. Where multiple users share a<br>
cellular phone, these difficulties are likely to be more pronounced.<br><br>
2<br>
In addition to the foregoing problems, other customer satisfaction issues are<br>
likely to arise as well, including the perceived health concerns about cellular phone<br>
radiation. This health concern may be particularly manifested where users are faced<br>
with extended exposure. Naturally, limited battery life for talk and standby time also<br>
will present barrière to increased cellular phone use. Furthermore, the benefit of<br>
automated addressing for emergency 911 response usually is tied to a landline. On<br>
the other hand, eliminating the cost of a landline and the convenience of a single<br>
telephone number are attractive objectives.<br>
In an effort to address some of the shortcomings associated with increased<br>
cellular telephone usage, some have proposed products that are essentially a cellular<br>
phone charger with a telephone jack. By attaching a cordless or other telephone to the<br>
jack in the charger, a traditional telephone may be used for placing and receiving calls<br>
through the cellular phone. While providing some benefits, these simple products<br>
lack many features that consumers will find userul. For example, consumers may<br>
want to route incoming calls to particular telephones within a house or office. This<br>
feature may be of particular value where multiple cellular telephones are available for<br>
use.<br>
Similarly, consumers also may wish to automatically route outgoing calls to<br>
any of multiple cellular telephones or to either a cellular phone or a landlines<br>
depending on the circumstances surrounding the outgoing calls. As a further<br>
convenience, consumers may desire call routing for incoming and outgoing calls to<br>
vary over the course of a day. Support for a variety of telephone types may help<br>
address certain needs in business or relatively sophisticated home installations.<br>
Furthermore, rudimentary charger products fail to exposé the rich call feature sets<br>
available in most cellular networks. Due at least in part to the simplicity of these<br>
products, they offer no facility for receiving configuration information, such as from a<br>
personal computer. Accordingly, methods, systems, and computer program products<br>
are desired for bridging mobile phone networks with other telephone networks.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It should be appreciated that this summary is intended only to providé a brief<br>
overview of the invention and should not be interpreted as limiting its scope, which is<br>
defmed by the claims. The present inventïon extends to methods, systems, and<br><br>
3<br>
computer program products for bridging mobile phone networks with other telephone<br>
networks. For example, a telephone network may comprise multiple individually<br>
addressable telephone lines connected to one or more telephones. The individually<br>
addressable telephone lines are connected to a gateway, which in turn is connected to<br>
one or more mobile phones. The gateway also may be connected to one or more<br>
landlines.<br>
When the gateway receives an inbound call from one of the mobile phones,<br>
the gateway applies one or more routing mies to determine one or more of the<br>
individually addressable telephone lines through which the inbound call should be<br>
connected. Once identified, the gateway connects the inbound call to the one or more<br>
individually addressable telephone lines, allowing the telephones connected to the<br>
individually addressable telephone lines to be used for the call inbound from the<br>
mobile phone. To help identify the mobile phone as the source of the inbound call, a<br>
distinctive ring option may be selected.<br>
Similarly, when the gateway receives an outbound call from a telephone<br>
connected to the gateway through one of the individually addressable telephone lines,<br>
the gateway applies one or more routing rules to select a mobile phone or landline<br>
through which the outbound call should be routed. Having selected a mobile phone or<br>
landline, the gateway connects the outbound call appropriately.<br>
Routing may depend on a variety of factors, such as time of day, cost, the<br>
mobile phone receiving an inbound call, etc. Telephones may be any or a<br>
combination of analog telephones, integrated service digital network telephones,<br>
digital telephones, Internet protocol telephones, and the like. Due to differences in the<br>
mobile phone network and the telephone network, the gateway translates signals<br>
between the two networks. This translation allows for the generation of appropriate<br>
ring voltages and dial tones, as well as features like call waiting, message<br>
notifications, caller ID, caller waiting ID, call forwarding, phone forwarding,<br>
conference calls, transferring calls, and so forth, which may be available at the mobile<br>
phone network, but not at the telephone network at all, or not at the telephone network<br>
with the same interaction as would occur directly with the mobile phone network.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the<br>
description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be<br><br>
4<br>
leanied by the practica of the invention. The features and advantages of the invention<br>
may be realized and obtained by means of the Instruments and combinations<br>
particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the<br>
present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and<br>
appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth<br>
hereinafter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order to describe the marmer in which the above-recited and other<br>
advantages and features of the invention can be obtained, a more particular<br>
description of the invention briefly described above will be rendered by reference to<br>
specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.<br>
Understanding that these drawings depict only typical embodiments of the invention<br>
and are not therefore to be considered as limiting its scope, the invention will be<br>
described and explained with additional specificity and detail through the use of the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure l illustrates an example environment for practicing the present<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows an example embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figures 3A-3B show example acts and steps for methods of routing calls in<br>
accordance with the present invention; and<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example system that provides a suitable operating<br>
environment for the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program<br>
products for bridging a mobile phone network and another telephone network. The<br>
embodiments of the present invention may comprise one or more special purpose<br>
and/or one or more genera! purpose computers including various computer hardware,<br>
as discussed in greater detail below.<br>
Figure l illustrates an example environment for practicing the present<br>
invention, where gateway 130 operates as a bridge between cellular network 120 and<br>
a telephone network with multiple individually addressable telephone lines 170<br>
connected to telephones 180. Cellular network 120 may be any type of cellular<br><br>
5<br>
network, including, for example, a GSM network, a TDMA network, or a CDMA<br>
network. GSM or global system for mobile communication is a digital mobile<br>
telephone system used widely in Europe and other areas. GSM is the most widely<br>
used of these three technologies and is a variation of TDMA. TDMA or time division<br>
multiple access divides each cellular channel into three time slots. CDMA or<br>
code-division multiple access uses a spread spectrum technology and generally refers<br>
to any of various protocols. Both TDMA and CDMA are common in the United<br>
States.<br>
For gateway 130 the connection to cellular network 120 includes a connection<br>
to cellular phone 140 through connection 132 and a wireless connection from cellular<br>
phone 140 to the cellular network 120. It should be noted that cellular phone 140 is<br>
one type of mobile phone. As used in this specification, the term "mobile phone"<br>
refers to wireless phones that connect directly with a third-party wireless service<br>
provider, in contrast to, for example, cordless phones, which connect directly to a<br>
consumer base station. Accordingly, "mobile phone" includes cellular phones,<br>
satellite phones, etc.<br>
Connection 132 between cellular phone 140 and gateway 130 may comprise a<br>
serial connection, a universal serial bus ("USB") connection, a Bluetooth connection,<br>
an 802.l lx connection, or some other type of connection, including other wired and<br>
wireless connections. 802.11 is a family of specifications related to wireless local<br>
area network ("LAN") technology. Specifically, 802.11 specifïes a wireless interface<br>
between a wireless cliënt and a base station or between two wireless clients.<br>
Similarly, Bluetooth defïnes a short-range wireless connection specification for<br>
mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants ("PDAs"). It is appropriate<br>
to point out here, that the term "connection" should be interpreted broadly to<br>
encompass any type of link that allows for the transfer of information.<br>
As indicated above various telephones 180 are also connected to gateway 130<br>
through individually addressable telephone lines 170. For example, single-line analog<br>
POTS telephone 180a is connected to gateway 130 through wired line 170a;<br>
multi-line analog POTS telephone 180b is connected to gateway 130 through one or<br>
more wired lines 170b; wireless POTS telephone 180c is connected to gateway 130<br>
through wireless line 170c; digital, 802.11, or other telephone 180d is connected to<br><br>
6<br>
gateway 130 through line 170d; and serial POTS telephones 180e are connected to<br>
gateway 130 through a common line 170e. Similar to connection, the term "line"<br>
should be interpreted broadly to encompass any link capable of transferring data,<br>
whether wireless or wired. In some implementations, a single line may be<br>
multiplexed for multiple phones, using, for example, some form of frequency-based<br>
or time-based multiplexing. It should be noted that line 170e represent an<br>
individually addressable telephone line even though three serial (i.e., daisy-chained)<br>
telephones are connected to it.<br>
Figure l shows mostly POTS telephones. POTS is short for plain old<br>
telephone service and refers to the standard telephone service that most homes in the<br>
United States use. POTS may be contrasted with high-speed digital communication<br>
lines, like ISDN and FDDI, which offer greater bandwidth and speed. Often, POTS is<br>
used interchangeably with PSTN, or public switched telephone network.<br>
Of course, telephones 180 can be any type of telephones, including analog<br>
telephones, digital telephones, ISDN telephones, wireless telephones, Internet<br>
protocol telephones, session initiation protocol ("SIP") telephones, etc. SIP<br>
telephones allow for various services, such as instant messaging ("IM"), short<br>
message service ("SMS"), multimedia message service ("MMS"), and the like.<br>
PSTN 110 is connected to gateway 130 through dMark 112 and includes one<br>
or more landlines. (Although many portions of PSTN 110 may be digital, historically<br>
the fïnal link between a home and the central or local telephone office ("CO") is<br>
analog.) Personal computer 150 and other computer 160 are also connected to<br>
gateway 130 through line or connection 132, and may be used as phones and/or for<br>
configuring gateway 130.<br>
To help appreciate the benefits of gateway 130, consider the following<br>
scenario. A family that includes a father, a mother, and a son lives in a single family<br>
house with standard POTS phones in most rooms. Because each of them has their<br>
own cellular phone, they have decided to cancel their POTS phone service. Prior to<br>
canceling their POTS phone service, when the family members arrived home they<br>
placed their cellular phones in chargers to préparé the phone for use the next day.<br>
This is inconvenient now because people call their cellular phones rather man their<br>
home phones. With their cellular phones in the chargers, the family found that they<br><br>
7<br>
missed calïs because the chargers were frequently in another room away from at least<br>
some of the family members. However, by keeping their phones with mem, the<br>
family members occasionally forgot to put their phone in the charger and would not<br>
have enough of a charge for the next day.<br>
Installing gateway 130 solved many of the problems the family experienced,<br>
without having to reactivate the POTS line. (Although, it should be pointed out that<br>
in some embodiments of the invention, one or more POTS lines are available to the<br>
gateway.) A sputter plugged into the house's dMark 112 isolates the house from the<br>
PSTN 110 and allows the gateway to address various phone lines (170a-170e)<br>
individually. (Among other things, isolation is important because gateway 130 will<br>
generale ring voltages.) For configuration, gateway 130 may be connected to a USB<br>
port on PC 150.<br>
The family's cellular phones (like cellular phone 140) are connected to<br>
chargers that are connected to the gateway through connection 132. Note that the<br>
chargers may be incorporated into the gateway 130, may be separate but connected to<br>
gateway 130, etc. When configuration begins, PC 150 shows the three cellular<br>
telephones and their corresponding numbers. (An example embodiment for PC 150 is<br>
described in greater detail below with respect to Figure 4.) The configuration<br>
software then discovers each of the available phones in the house by trying each of<br>
the telephone lines 170a-170e. As each telephone rings, a descriptive name may be<br>
entered to help better identify the phone through the remainder of the configuration<br>
process. (Descriptive names also may be given to each cellular phone.)<br>
Continuing on with more advanced configuration options, various of the<br>
telephone lines (and corresponding telephones) are selected for routing inbound calls<br>
on each of the cellular phones. For example, one or more routing rules may route<br>
inbound calls to the son's cellular telephone to only the kitchen, the TV room, and the<br>
son's bedroom. Routing rules also may include a time-of-day component. For<br>
example, to establish quiet time, calls inbound to the son's cellular telephone may be<br>
routed to an answering machine (including a voice messaging system) during late<br>
evening and early morning hours. These routing rules also may restrict outbound<br>
calls. During configuration, unique rings may be assigned to everyone's cellular<br>
phone to help identify the source of an inbound call. When the configuration is<br><br>
8<br>
complete, the configuration Information is downloaded to the gateway 130 from PC<br>
150 so that the gateway does not need the PC to function correctly.<br>
Sometime after the gateway 130 has been configured, the father returns home<br>
and places his cellular phone into a charger. Later, the correct phones ring in the<br>
house as determined by the routing rules for the father. The phones ring with a ring<br>
tone indicating that the father's cellular phone is the source of the call. The father<br>
answers the call with the nearest POTS phone, just as when the family had POTS<br>
service. During the call, hè conferences his wife into the call. Again, like when the<br>
family had POTS service, the father does a flash hook, dials the number for his wife,<br>
and does another flash hook to connect the conference call. This is possible because<br>
the gateway maps the POTS telephone network signals to their cellular equivalent.<br>
While his parents are on their call, the son determines hè would like to call a<br>
friend. He plugs his phone into the charger and goes to his room to make the call. He<br>
picks up his telephone and makes the call just like hè did when hè had a POTS line,<br>
except, whereas before the family had only one POTS line and only one person could<br>
make a call at a time, the gateway routes the son's call from his room to his cellular<br>
telephone. This is possible because the gateway's routing rules associate the<br>
telephone in the son's room with his cellular telephone.<br>
Figure 2 shows some additional details for an example gateway 200 in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Gateway 200 includes one or more mobile<br>
phone connectors / charging cradles 210, one or more telephone connectors 220, one<br>
or more landline connections 230, and one or more computer network connectors 240.<br>
It should be noted that each of these connectors should be interpreted broadly to<br>
encompass any structure suitable for linking gateway 200 to a mobile telephone, a<br>
telephone line, a landline, and/or a computer network.<br>
Within gateway 200, each of these connectors is connected to one or more line<br>
interfaces 250, which may be included within the connectors, within the processor<br>
260, or as a separate component as shown in Figure 2. One or more storage media<br>
270 store data 272, routing rules 274, map instructions 276, synchronize instructions<br>
278, etc. (Note that as described with respect to Figure 4, storage media may take any<br>
of a variety of forms, including solid state devices for enhanced reliability.)<br>
Synchronize instructions 278 are for synchronizing data 272 with a version of the data<br><br>
9<br>
stored on a connected mobile telephone. For exarnple, data 272 might include a<br>
telephone directly, a call log, etc. The processor 260 executes the routing rules 274,<br>
synchronize instructions 278, map instructions 276, and other instructions, to direct<br>
the operation of the gateway.<br>
Map instructions 276 are used to map mobile phone network signals to the<br>
telephone network equivalent, and vice-versa. This allows gateway 200 to exposé the<br>
rich fünctionality offered by most cellular phone networks to the telephone network.<br>
These signals may include a call waiting signal, an abandoned call signal, a hold<br>
signal, a message notification signal, a caller LD signal, a caller waiting ID signal, a<br>
call forward signal, a phone forward signal, a conference call signal, a transfer call<br>
signal, a ring voltage signal, a dial tone signal, a signal for indicating received<br>
messages, etc. The gateway 200 may include various other computer hardware and<br>
software as discussed in greater detail below with respect to Figure 4.<br>
The present invention also may be described in terms of methods comprising<br>
functional steps and/or non-functional acts. The following is a description of acts and<br>
steps that may be performed in practicing the present invention. Usually, functional<br>
steps describe the invention in terms of results that are accomplished, whereas<br>
non-functional acts describe more specific actions for achieving a particular result.<br>
Although the functional steps and non-functional acts may be described or claimed in<br>
a particular order, the present invention is not necessarily limited to any particular<br>
ordering or combination of acts and/or steps.<br>
Specifkally, Figures 3A-3B show example acts and steps for methods of<br>
routing calls in accordance with the present invention, For inbound calls (Figure 3A),<br>
a gateway may perform an act of receiving (310 A) configuration information, such as<br>
from a PC. This configuration information may include routing mies, ring options,<br>
other rules, etc. The gateway receives (320A) an inbound call. A step for<br>
determining (330A) which of one or more line(s) of the individually addressable<br>
telephone lines connected to the gateway should be used for routing an inbound call<br>
may include acts of applying (332A) one or more routing rules to the inbound call, an<br>
act of applying (334A) one or more other rules that control operation of the gateway,<br>
and selecting (336A) one of one or more available ring options to identify the mobile<br>
phone that is the source of the inbound call.<br><br>
10<br>
A step for mapping (340A) one or more mobile phone network signals to one<br>
or more corresponding telephone network signal and mapping one or more telephone<br>
network signals to one or more corresponding mobile phone network signals may<br>
include an act of translating (342A) between the one or more mobile phone network<br>
signals and the one or more telephone network signals. A step for routing (350A) an<br>
inbound call to the one or more of the individually addressable telephone lines that the<br>
gateway determined should be used for routing the inbound call may include an act of<br>
connecting (352A) the inbound call to the one or more of the individually addressable<br>
telephone lines identify by the routing rules.<br>
For outbound calls (Figure 3B) a gateway may perform an act of receiving<br>
(310B) confïguration information from a PC. It should be noted that showing this act<br>
in both Figures 3A (310A) and 3B (310B), does not necessarily require separate<br>
receiving acts for inbound and outbound calls. This confïguration information may<br>
include routing and other rules. The gateway receives (320B) an outbound call. A<br>
step for determining (330B) which of one or more mobile phones and one or more<br>
landlines should be selected to carry the outbound call may include acts of applying<br>

Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include computer-<br>
readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data<br>
structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media<br>
that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of<br>
example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM,<br>
ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disc storage, magnetic disk storage or<br><br>
11<br>
other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or<br>
store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or<br>
data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose<br>
computer.<br>
When information is transferred or provided over a network or another<br>
Communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of<br>
hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a<br>
computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a<br>
computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included<br>
within the scope of computer-readable media. Computer-executable instructions<br>
comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer,<br>
special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certaïn<br>
function or group of functions.<br>
Figure 4 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general<br>
description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be<br>
implemented. Although not required, the invention will be described in the general<br>
context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being<br>
executed by computers in network environments. Generally, program modules<br>
include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform<br>
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer-executable<br>
instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of<br>
the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The<br>
particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures<br>
represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described<br>
in such steps.<br>
Those skilied in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in<br>
network computing environments with many types of computer system<br>
configurations, including personal computers, hand-held devices, multi-processor<br>
systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs,<br>
minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be<br>
practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local<br>
and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless<br><br>
12<br>
links, or by a combination of hardwired or wireless links) through a Communications<br>
network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located<br>
in both local and remote memory storage devices.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, an example- system for implementing the invention<br>
includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer 420, including<br>
a processing unit 421, a system memory 422, and a system bus 423 that couples<br>
various system components including the system memory 422 to the processing unit<br>
421. The system bus 423 may be any of several types of bus structures including a<br>
memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a<br>
variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)<br>
424 and random access memory (RAM) 425. A basic input/output system (BIOS)<br>
426, containing the basic routines that help transfer information between elements<br>
within the computer 420, such as during start-up, may be stored in ROM 424.<br>
Although not shown in Figure 4, the various connectors and interfaces shown<br>
in Figure 2 may be present where the computer shown in Figure 4 is used as a<br>
gateway. It should be noted that the relatively complexity of a gateway may depend<br>
on whether conftguration will occur through an external computer or if the gateway is<br>
completely self-sufficient, as well as other factors. Furthermore, Figure 4 represents<br>
only an example of one possible embodiment for a gateway according to the present<br>
invention or a computer used to configure the gateway. Accordingly, much of the<br>
hardware and software described with respect to Figure 4 is optional and is likely to<br>
vary from one implementation to another.<br>
The computer 420 may also include a magnetic hard disk drive 427 for<br>
reading from and writing to a magnetic hard disk 439, a magnetic disk drive 428 for<br>
reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk 429, and an optical disc drive<br>
430 for reading from or writing to removable optical disc 431 such as a CD-ROM or<br>
other optical media. The magnetic hard disk drive 427, magnetic disk drive 428, and<br>
optical disc drive 430 are connected to the system bus 423 by a hard disk drive<br>
interface 432, a magnetic disk drive-interface 433, and an optical drive interface 434,<br>
respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide<br>
nonvolatile storage of computer-executable instructions, data structures, program<br>
modules and other data for the computer 420. Although the exemplary environment<br><br>
13<br>
described herein employs a magnetic hard disk 439, a removable magnetic disk 429<br>
and a removable optical disc 431, other types of computer readable media for storing<br>
data can be used, including magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile<br>
discs, Bemoulli cartridges, RAMs, ROMs, and the like.<br>
Program code means comprising one or more program modules may be stored<br>
on the hard disk 439, magnetic disk 429, optical disc 431, ROM 424 or RAM 425,<br>
including an operating system 435, one or more applicaüon programs 436, other<br>
program modules 437, and program data 438. A user may enter commands and<br>
information into the computer 420 through keyboard 440, pointing device 442, or<br>
other input devices (not shown), such as a microphone, joy stick, game pad, satellite<br>
dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the<br>
processing unit 421 through a serial port interface 446 coupled to system bus 423.<br>
Alternatively, the input devices may be connected by other interfaces, such as a<br>
parallel port, a game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor 447 or another<br>
display device is also connected to system bus 423 via an interface, such as video<br>
adapter 448. Of course, a gateway may not require any type of display or may include<br>
a display integrated within the gateway itself, such as a relatively small liquid crystal<br>
display. In addition to the monitor, computer 420 may include other peripheral output<br>
devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.<br>
The computer 420 may operate in a networked environment using logical<br>
connections to one or more remote computers, such as remote computers 449a and<br>
449b. Remote computers 449a and 449b may each be a personal computer, a server, a<br>
router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically<br>
include many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer 420,<br>
although only memory storage devices 450a and 450b and their associated applicaüon<br>
programs 436a and 436b have been illustrated in Figure 4. The logical connections<br>
depicted in Figure 4 include a local area network (LAN) 451 and a wide area network<br>
(WAN) 452 that are presented here by way of example and not limitation. Such<br>
netwerking environments are commonplace in office-wide or enterprise-wide<br>
computer networks, intranets and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN netwerking environment, the computer 420 is connected<br>
to the local network 451 through a network interface or adapter 453. When used in a<br><br>
14<br>
WAN netwerking environment, the computer 420 may include a modem 454, a<br>
wireless link, or other means for establishing Communications over the wide area<br>
network 452, such as the Internet. The modem 454, which may be intemal or<br>
external, is connected to the system bus 423 via the serial port interface 446. In a<br>
nerworked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer 420, or<br>
portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be<br>
appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of<br>
establishing Communications over wide area network 452 may be used.<br>
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are<br>
to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of<br>
the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the<br>
foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of<br>
equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.<br>
