OIL FEED SYSTEM FOR A HYDRAULICALLY ACTUATED CAM PHASER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an oil feed system operable to<br>
communicate pressurized oil to a hydraulically actuated cam phaser.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A cam phaser is a device operable to selectively create a variable<br>
rotational offset between a camshaft and a crankshaft of an internal combustion engine.<br>
The degree of rotational offset created by the cam phaser enables the operating<br>
characteristics of the internal combustion engine to be tuned for specific performance<br>
requirements. The operation of the cam phaser is typically facilitated by providing<br>
pressurized oil to the cam phaser.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An internal combustion engine is provided having an engine block with a<br>
pressurized oil source and rotatably supporting a crankshaft. The internal combustion<br>
engine includes a camshaft rotatably mounted within the engine block and defines an<br>
axially extending cavity. The axially extending cavity extends between opposed first<br>
and second ends of the camshaft. A selectively actuatable cam phaser is mounted to the<br>
second end of the camshaft and is operable to vary the timing of the camshaft with<br>
respect to the crankshaft in response to pressurized oil. A cover is removably mounted<br>
to the engine block and is operable to substantially enclose the first end of the camshaft.<br>
The cover at least partially defines a passage in communication with the pressurized oil<br>
source, defined by the engine block, and the axially extending cavity, defined by the<br>
camshaft. The passage and the axially extending cavity are operable to communicate<br>
pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source to the cam phaser to actuate the cam<br>
phaser.<br><br>
GP-308798-PTE-JK<br>
2<br>
[0004]	The cover may be mounted to the engine block via a plurality of<br>
fasteners. Preferably, the cover is sealed with respect to the engine block. A portion<br>
of the cam phaser may be at least partially housed within the axially extending cavity.<br>
The portion defines a cam phaser feed passage operable to communicate pressurized oil<br>
from the axially extending cavity defined by the camshaft to the cam phaser.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure 1 is a exploded view of a portion of an internal combustion engine<br>
illustrating an engine block having a cover mountable thereto;<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a front view of the cover of Figure 1 illustrating a passage<br>
partially defined therein; and<br>
[0008]	Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a cam phaser mounted to a camshaft<br>
of the internal combustion engine, shown in Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0009]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
portion of an internal combustion engine, generally indicated at 10. The internal<br>
combustion engine 10 includes a cylinder block or engine block 12 defining at least one<br>
cylinder 14 within which a piston, not shown, is reciprocally movable. A crankshaft 16 is<br>
rotatably supported by the engine block 12 and is operatively connected to a camshaft 17<br>
through a cam drive assembly 18, shown in Figure 3, to effect rotation of the camshaft<br>
17. The camshaft 17 is rotatably supported within the engine bock 12 and is operable to<br>
selectively open and close intake and exhaust valves, not shown, during the operation of<br>
the internal combustion engine 10. The camshaft 17 defines a hollow passageway or<br><br>
GP-308798-PTE-JK<br>
3<br>
cavity 20. The cavity 20 extends generally axiaily along the entire length of the camshaft<br>
17 between a first end 22 and an opposed second end 24, shown in Figure 3.<br>
[0010]	The engine block 12 is preferably cast from a metal, such as cast iron or<br>
aluminum, and includes a pressurized oil source 26. The pressurized oil source 26 is<br>
configured to communicate pressurized oil to lifter galleries to enable operation of<br>
hydraulic lash adjusters or lifters, not shown. A cover 28 is configured to be removably<br>
mounted to the engine block 12 by a plurality of fasteners 30. The cover 28 is operable<br>
to substantially enclose the pressurized oil source 26 and the first end 22 of the camshaft<br>
17. The cover 28 sealingly engages the engine block 12. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize suitable means of sealing the cover 28 to the engine block 12 such as, for<br>
example, room temperature vulcanization (RTV) sealant, gasket, etc.<br>
[0011]	The cover 28 defines a bore 32 configured to receive a generally<br>
cylindrical portion 34 of the crankshaft 16 therethrough. A lip seal 36 is provided within<br>
the bore 32 and is operable to sealingly engage the portion 34 of the crankshaft 16. The<br>
lip seal 36 is operable to prevent foreign material from entering the internal combustion<br>
engine 10 through the cover 28 to crankshaft 16 interface. Additionally, the lip seal 36 is<br>
operable to prevent the external leakage of oil from within the internal combustion engine<br>
10.<br>
[0012]	Referring to Figure 2, and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
shown a front view of the cover 28, i.e. the side of the cover 28 that engages the engine<br>
block 12 when mounted thereto. The cover 28 at least partially defines a passage 40 that,<br>
when the cover 28 is installed on the engine block 12, is in communication with<br>
pressurized oil source 26 and the cavity 20. Therefore, pressurized oil contained within<br>
the pressurized oil source 26 is communicated directly to the cavity 20 via the passage<br>
40. The engine block 12 may partially define the passage 40 while remaining within the<br>
scope of that which is claimed herein.<br>
[0013]	Referring to Figure 3, and with continued reference to Figures 1 and 2.<br>
there is shown a cam phaser assembly 42 mounted to the second end 24 of the camshaft<br>
17 and configured to be driven by the crankshaft 16 through the cam drive assembly 18.<br>
The cam drive assembly 18 includes a crankshaft sprocket 44, mounted to the crankshaft<br><br>
GP-308798-PTE-JK<br>
4<br>
16, and a camshaft sprocket 46, mounted to the cam phaser assembly 42. The crankshaft<br>
sprocket 44 is drivingly connected to the camshaft sprocket 46 by a timing chain 48.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize other methods of providing drive force between the<br>
crankshaft 16 and the cam phaser assembly 42 such as, for example, a gear drive. The<br>
cam drive assembly 18 further includes a tensioner or snubber 50 operable to tension and<br>
stabilize the timing chain 48 during operation of the internal combustion engine 10.<br>
[0014]	The cam phaser assembly 42 is hydraulically actuated and includes a valve<br>
body 52 that extends at least partially into the cavity 20 defined by the camshaft 17. The<br>
valve body 52 is operable to selectively and variably communicate pressurized oil from<br>
within the cavity 20 to the cam phaser 42 to effect actuation thereof. In operation,<br>
pressurized oil is communicated from the pressurized oil source 26 to the cavity 20 via<br>
the passage 40. The cavity 20 communicates the pressurized oil the entire length of the<br>
camshaft 17 to the valve body 52. The valve body 52 defines a cam phaser feed passage<br>
53 operable to communicate pressurized oil from the cavity 20 to the cam phaser<br>
assembly 42. The valve body 52, in response to control signals, selectively and variably<br>
actuates the cam phaser assembly 42 to vary the rotational offset or timing of the<br>
camshaft 17 with respect to the crankshaft 16. A target wheel 54 is mounted to the cam<br>
phaser assembly 42 and cooperates with a sensor, not shown, to communicate the<br>
position, i.e. advanced or retarded, of the camshaft 17.<br>
[0015]	While the internal combustion engine 10 illustrated in Figure 1 is shown<br>
having only one camshaft 17, those skilled in the art will recognize that additional<br>
camshafts 17 may be provided while remaining within the scope of that which is<br>
claimed. By providing a main or priority pressurized oil supply circuit to the cam<br>
phaser 42, performance of the cam phaser 42 may be improved since pressurized oil<br>
provided to the cam phaser 42 is not significantly affected by leakage within other<br>
components of the internal combustion engine 10, nor is it significantly affected by<br>
engine speed.<br>
[0016]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br><br>
GP-308798-PTE-JK<br>
5<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
