The invention relates to a  pneumatic   brake   for  a textile combing machine.<br>
Conventional combing machine is provided with electrically operated brake attached to the drive shaft which drives the cylindrical comber. The electrically operated brake hold the shaft in position arresting the motion of the drive shaft when power is switched off. This ensures the maintenance of the correct position of the comber relative to other moving parts. However when there is a power failure this brake will not function. In an alternative embodiment, the brake used for sloping the shaft is pneumatic. Lack of pressurised air which may be resulted due to power failure of longer duration or due to other reasons will result in non functioning of such pneumatic brakes. Further monitoring the wear of the braker plates cannot be carried out with the conventional braking systems.<br>
It is desirable to have a braking system for arresting the motion of the shaft of the combing machine which is effective even when the electric supply is absent. It is also desirable to monitor and control of the wear of braking plate in a brake provided in a combining machine.<br><br>
The pneumatic brake for a combing Machine according to the invention provides a brake which arrest the motion of the shaft of the combing machine when power fails or switched off and it continuously monitors the wear of the brake plates. In the pneumatic brake according to the invention the pressure plate gets automatically adjusted exerting pressure on a pressure pad by a spring provided in a pneumatic cylinder and the pressure on the pressure pad is released by the release of the spring by activating the pneumatic cylinder when the power is restored. While the brake is operated it provides an information regarding the wear of the brake plates and thus avoid brake failure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a pneumatic brake for a textile combing machine comprising a first fixed plate located on the projection of drive motor of the combing machine and concentric to the shaft of the said drive motor, a brake drive having a hub, the hub portion being fixed to the shaft of the drive motor and capable of moving freely, a second fixed plate fixed rigidly to a pneumatic cylinder and mounted on the first fixed plate providing a space between the first fixed plate and the second fixed plate, a moving plate being fixed to the piston rod of the pneumatic cylinder capable of moving along the axis of the shaft of the drive motor, the said moving plate being at its extended position when the pneumatic cylinder is not activated, exerting pressure on the brake disc and arresting the motor shaft by the contact of brake disc with the first fixed plate and an extended member being provided on the moving plate, the position of which is being sensed by a sensor.<br><br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the pneumatic brake for a textile combing machine according to the invention.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 shows two prefered embodiments of the pneumatic brake shown in fig. 1.<br>
The pneumatic brake according to the invention comprises a first fixed plate (B) fixed to the projection of the motor (A) of the combing machine. The fixed plate (B) is fixed to the motor body concentric to the shaft of the motor (A). A brake disc (D) having a hub (C). Preferably the hub ( C ) is provided with splines. The hub portion is fixed to the shaft of the motor. The brake disc (D) move freely on the hub (C) axially. A second fixed plate (F) is fixed rigidly to a pneumatic cylinder (G). The assembly of second fixed plate (F) and the pneumatic cylinder (G) is mounted on to the first fixed plate (B) providing a space between the first and second fixed plates. Preferably the assembly is mounted on to the first fixed plate (B) by at least three long bushes (I) and screws (M) providing the space between the first and second fixed plates (B and F). A moving plate (E) is fixed to the end of the piston rod of the pneumatic cylinder (G) and the moving plate (E) is at its extended position applying pressure on the brake disc (D) which in turn presses  against the first fixed plate (B ).<br><br>
The piston of the pneumatic cylinder (G) is spring loaded to provide the required torque. When the pneumatic cylinder (G) is activated the moving plate (E) releases the pressure on the brake disc (D) by the backward movement of the piston of the pneumatic air cylinder (G) and the brake is released from the shaft of the motor (A) making it free to rotate.<br>
The normal position of the moving plate (E) is in its extended position and therefore the brake on the shaft of the motor is applied when the power is switched off. An extended member (L) is provided on the moving plate (E) which is sensed by a sensor (M. Nr O). The sensor comprises two sensing elements. One of them is located farther from the first fixed plate (B) for sensing that the brake is in the released condition. The other sensing element is located to sense the critical thickness of the brake lining on the brake disc (D) to avoid metalic contact when the brake lining wears out by use.<br>
A prefered embodiment of the sensing elements comprises two insulated electrical contacts (M) which provides a signal when the extended member (L) on the moving plate (E) makes a contact with any of these electrical contacts.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the sensor elements comprises two limit switches (N) which provides signals when the extended member (L) on the moving plate (E) activates any one of the two limit switches (N). Yet another embodiment of the sensing elements comprises two proximity switches (O) which provides a signal when the extended member (L) on the moving plate (E) comes close to any one of the proximity switches (O). The signal from the sensor may be connected to a programmable logic controller (PLC) which provides the information on the display that the brake is in released condition and provides warning that the brake lining js worn out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
