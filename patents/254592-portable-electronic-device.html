TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a structure of a<br>
portable electronic device, and in particular, to a structure<br>
for improving the operability of the portable electronic<br>
device.<br>
BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY<br>
Recently various types of gaming products have been<br>
developed and they occupy a high position in entertainment<br>
field. In particular, portable gaming devices become popular<br>
recently and a user can enjoy playing games with the device<br>
anywhere.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various types of portable electronic devices such as<br>
portable gaming devices and personal digital assistances<br>
(PDAs) are developed. Many of them have a casing taking shape<br>
similar to a rectangular solid. When a user plays a game with<br>
the portable electronic device, it is difficult for the user<br>
to grip the casing, and low operability of the device reduces<br>
interest in the game. There is another problem that the user's<br>
hands become fatigued easily when the user grips the casing of<br><br>
rectangular shape for a long time.<br>
It is a general purpose of the invention to provide a<br>
portable electronic device having an easy-to-operate shape by<br>
a user.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to a<br>
portable electronic device comprising a horizontally long<br>
casing, both ends of which are capable of being gripped by a<br>
user's both hands, respectively, and a display unit fit into<br>
the casing, wherein outwardly projecting bulges are<br>
respectively formed at both sides of the rear face of the<br>
casing where fingers of the user gripping the casing placed.<br>
According to the embodiment, since the fingers and a palm<br>
of a user are naturally flexed to fit to the dome-like bulges<br>
on the rear face of the casing, it is easy to grip the<br>
portable electronic device. And the operability is hard to be<br>
degraded even if the portable electronic device is vibrated<br>
strongly while a game is being played with the device. In<br>
addition, the portable electronic device fits comfortably in<br>
the user's hands. Therefore, even if the user grips the<br>
portable electronic device for a long time, the user feels<br>
hardly tired.<br>
The casing of the portable electric device may be a resin<br>
molded part. The resin molded part comprises a transparent<br>
window through which the display unit can be viewed and a<br>
frame other than the transparent window. The transparent<br>
window is made of a first transparent resin. The frame is made<br><br>
from a second colored resin. The first resin and the second<br>
resin are preferably molded in a unified fashion by two-color<br>
molding. As such, by molding the transparent window and the<br>
frame in a unified fashion, strength of the casing may be<br>
ensured.<br>
The first resin may be molded to cover whole surface of<br>
the frame in the resin molded part of the casing. Thus,<br>
uniform surface without a joint, a step, or a gap on the<br>
surface of the casing may be formed, which adds to the beauty.<br>
The portable electronic device may comprise a speaker<br>
within the casing. A through hole may be formed at the bottom<br>
face of the casing for emitting sounds generated from the<br>
speaker. The through hole may be formed with an angle toward<br>
the front face of the casing. Thus, sounds are emitted toward<br>
the face of the user gripping the portable electronic device.<br>
The portable electronic device may comprise a second<br>
through hole formed in the front face of the casing,and a<br>
duct formed inside the casing for directing sounds generated<br>
from the speaker to the second through hole. Thus, the user<br>
feels such that sounds are output from the front face of the<br>
casing. So, high realistic feeling is realized.<br>
Any combination of elements stated above is also<br>
effective as one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to the embodiments, the operability of a<br>
portable electronic device may be improved because of bulges<br>
are provided on a back face of a casing of the device.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
Figs. 1 through 6 are views showing the appearance of a<br>
portable electronic device 100 according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Fig. 1 is a front view of the portable<br>
electronic device 100. A casing 10 has a horizontally long<br>
oval shape as a whole. Each end of the casing 10 is formed in<br>
a circular curve shape with its center decentered from a<br>
center line 14 by a certain distance.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 4, the casing 10 is composed of<br>
an upper part 10a, an intermediate part 10b, and a lower part<br>
10c. Inside the casing 10, a circuit board (not shown) is<br>
provided. The circuit board includes: switch contacts for<br><br>
generating a signal by the operation of various corresponding<br>
buttons; a central processing unit which processes the signals<br>
so as to execute various computations; an image processing<br>
unit for executing image process; and a sound processing unit<br>
for executing sound process. The circuit board (not shown) is<br>
secured to the upper part 10a or the lower part 10c. The<br>
intermediate part 10b has a higher rigidity than those of the<br>
upper part 10a and the lower part 10c to ensure the rigidity<br>
of the entire casing 10.<br>
Returning to Fig. 1, a liquid crystal display 12<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as an "LCD 12") serving as a display<br>
device is fit into the center of the casing 10. The LCD 12<br>
displays, for example, a game screen when the portable<br>
electronic device 100 functions as a game machine or displays<br>
a schedule or an address list when the portable electronic<br>
device 100 functions as a personal digital assistant (PDA).<br>
FIG.7 shows the shape of the upper part 10a. The upper<br>
part 10a is a resin molded part. The LCD 12 and various<br>
buttons mounted on the circuit board are covered by the upper<br>
part 10a. The upper part 10a comprises a transparent window<br>
102 and a frame 104. FIG. 8 shows the frame 104. A<br>
substantially rectangular space for the transparent window 102<br>
is formed in the frame 104. Holes 106, 108 where the various<br>
buttons are loosely inserted and holes for checking the LEDs<br>
therethrough are also formed in the frame 104.<br>
The transparent window 102 is made of transparent resin<br><br>
material for protecting the LCD 12 and for enabling the LCD 12<br>
being viewed through the window. The frame 104 is made of a<br>
colored resin material to conceal the circuit board from view.<br>
The transparent window 102 and the frame 104 are molded in a<br>
unified manner by two-color molding technology, which molds<br>
two resins of different colors or materials at the same time.<br>
More specifically, after injecting a colored resin material<br>
for forming the frame 104 into a mold form, a transparent<br>
resin material for forming the transparent window 102 is also<br>
injected into the mold form. At that time, the transparent<br>
material is molded to cover not only the transparent window<br>
102 but the whole surface of the frame 104 (that is, the<br>
surface viewed by the user gripping the portable electronic<br>
device 100) except for the button holes like a thin film. Thus,<br>
uniform surface without a joint, a step, or a gap between the<br>
transparent window 102 and the frame 104 is formed, adding to<br>
the beauty and improving the visibility of the LCD 12 through<br>
the transparent window 102.<br>
Regions of the frame 104 situated above and below the<br>
transparent window 102 (that is, a decorative area 16 and a<br>
button area 50), is very narrow as shown in Figs. 7 and 8.<br>
Therefore, by performing the two-color molding, strength of<br>
the upper part 10a become improved when compared to the<br>
structure that a transparent sheet is attached onto the LCD<br>
for protection or the structure that transparent sheet is fit<br>
into the frame 104. Since the user sometimes pushes strongly<br><br>
the surface of the casing of the portable electronic device<br>
for button operation, the casing should have certain strength.<br>
By molding the transparent window and the frame in a unified<br>
manner according to the embodiment, strength can be ensured.<br>
In addition, since the transparent window 102 and the frame<br>
104 can be molded in a unified manner at the same time,<br>
molding cost may be reduced. Further, by coating the whole<br>
surface of the frame 104 with a transparent resin material,<br>
surface with luster appearance may be acquired, which adds to<br>
the beauty.<br>
As the resin materials, polycarbonate resin with shock<br>
resistance and transparency is preferable, but other resin<br>
such as acrylic may be employed. The transparent window and<br>
the frame may be molded in different resin materials from each<br>
other.<br>
Returning to Fig. 1, the surface of the upper part 10a of<br>
the casing 10, that is, the front face being opposite to the<br>
user is mainly composed of: a left-hand area 48L gripped by<br>
the left hand of the user; a right-hand area 48R gripped by<br>
the right hand of the user; the LCD 12; a horizontally long<br>
button area 50 positioned below the LCD 12, where various<br>
buttons are provided; and a decorative area 16 positioned<br>
above the LCD 12. Notches 84L and 84R are formed on an upper<br>
left corner and an upper right corner of the upper part 10a of<br>
the casing 10, respectively.<br>
In the left-hand area 48L, an arrow key 20 mainly for<br><br>
inputting a direction instruction and an analog device 22<br>
mainly for analog input of the direction instruction are<br>
provided. The detailed structures and functions thereof will<br>
be described below. Indicators 32 and 34 are also provided in<br>
the left-hand area 48L. The indicator 32 lights up during<br>
access to a removable recording medium, and the indicator 34<br>
lights up during wireless LAN (WLAN) communication.<br>
The analog device 22 is located on the device closer to<br>
the user than the arrow key 20. The horizontal center of the<br>
analog device 22 is located closer toward the center line of<br>
the casing 10 than the horizontal center of the arrow key 20.<br>
The reason for this arrangement is as follows. When the left<br>
thumb of the user moves between the arrow key 20 and the<br>
analog device 22, the user pivotally moves his thumb with his<br>
palm on the lower left corner of the casing 10 as a supporting<br>
point. And the user tilts the center of the analog device 22<br>
for operation. Therefore, the operation is facilitated when<br>
the analog device 22 is positioned closer to the center of the<br>
casing 10.<br>
In the right-hand area 48R, buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d<br>
(hereinafter, also collectively referred to as "button keys<br>
30") are provided mainly for inputting a unique instruction. A<br>
structure and functions of the button keys 30 will be<br>
described below. Additionally, indicators 36 and 40 are<br>
provided in the right-hand area 48R. The indicator 36 lights<br>
up when the portable electronic device 100 is ON. The<br><br>
indicator 40 lights when the portable electronic device 100 is<br>
in a hold status where every key of the portable electronic<br>
device 100 is invalid.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the center of the arrow key 20 and<br>
the center of the button keys 30 are preferably shifted upward<br>
in the vertical direction from the horizontal center line of<br>
the casing 10.<br>
The center of the arrow key 20 and the center of the<br>
button keys 30 are preferably located at the same distance<br>
from the center line 14 of the casing 10 in the horizontal<br>
direction. Each distance between pressed faces 20a, 20b, 20c<br>
and 20d on a disk-like key top of the arrow key 20 is<br>
preferably set smaller than that between the buttons 30a, 30b,<br>
30c and 30d. The reason for this arrangement is as follows.<br>
Since the arrow key 20 is mainly used to direct the vertical<br>
and horizontal movements, the user often keeps operating the<br>
arrow key 20. Therefore, it is preferable to set the distances<br>
between the pressed faces 20a, 20b, 20c and 20d of the key top<br>
so that the user can operate the arrow key 20 without taking<br>
his thumb off the pressed faces of the arrow key 20. On the<br>
other hand, the button keys 30 are often used to give<br>
different instructions by respective buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and<br>
30d. Therefore, it is easier for the user to operate taking<br>
his thumb off the button keys 30. Hence it is preferable that<br>
the buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d are located with a certain<br>
distance so as to avoid pressing unintended button with a tip<br><br>
of the thumb when the user places his/her thumb on one button.<br>
At both ends of the transparent window 102 of the upper<br>
part 10a, a front-face through hole 28L is provided in the<br>
left-hand area 48L, and a front-face through hole 28R is<br>
provided in the right-hand area 48R.<br>
The button area 50 is located in the vicinity of an outer<br>
edge of the upper part 10a of the casing 10 on the side closer<br>
to the user holding the portable electronic device 100. In the<br>
button area 50, buttons 52 to 64 are located other than the<br>
arrow key 20, analog device 22 and button keys 30. Preferably,<br>
the button area 50 is constituted so as to be visually<br>
distinct from the left-hand area 48L and the right-hand area<br>
48R. In this embodiment, the button area 50 is formed in a<br>
horizontally extending elongated hill-like shape. The button<br>
area 50 is elevated above the level of the plane formed by the<br>
left-hand area 48L, the right-hand area 48R and the LCD 12. In<br>
the vicinity of the top of the hill, various buttons 52 to 64<br>
are provided. With this arrangement, the user can visually<br>
distinguish the buttons to be operated during gameplay or an<br>
application operation from the other buttons. Furthermore,<br>
since the button area 50 is elevated, the user can be<br>
tactilely aware of the arrangement of these buttons 52 to 64.<br>
The elevated shape of the button area 50 also serves to<br>
protect the LCD 12.<br>
The structure of the button area 50 is not limited to the<br>
above-described structure. Any structure may be employed as<br><br>
long as the height of the button area 50 differs from the<br>
height of the left-hand area 48L and the right-hand area 48R.<br>
Herein, the "height" means a height based on a horizontal<br>
plane, on which the casing 10 is placed so that the upper part<br>
10a is oriented upward. For example, an elongated step having<br>
a trapezoidal or rectangular cross section may be provided to<br>
arrange the various buttons 52 to 64 thereon. Alternatively,<br>
walls having the height equal to or greater than height of top<br>
of the buttons 52 to 64 may be provided above and below the<br>
buttons 52 to 64 arranged on the same plane with the left-hand<br>
area 48L, the right-hand area 48R and the LCD 12. With these<br>
walls, the buttons 52 to 64 are not easily pressed down by the<br>
user's hands operating the arrow key 20 or the button keys 30.<br>
It is preferable that the buttons 52 to 64 (also referred<br>
to as "sub operation buttons") arranged in the button area 50<br>
are not frequently used for gameplay or a main operation of<br>
the other applications, and therefore the buttons 52 to 64 are<br>
not required to be frequently pressed. Specifically, a home<br>
button 52 is used to go 12 back to a main screen. A volume<br>
buttons 54, 56 serve to decrease / increase the volume of a<br>
sound reproduced through a speaker or a headphone,<br>
respectively. A display button 58 turns ON/OFF a backlight of<br>
the LCD 12. A sound button 60 turns ON/OFF a sound output. A<br>
select button 62 serves for selecting one item from items<br>
displayed on the LCD 12. A start button 64 mainly serves to<br>
start a game when a game program is being executed.<br><br>
In a conventional portable electronic device or game<br>
controller, buttons stated above are not provided on the plane<br>
different from the plane with the arrow key or the button keys<br>
as this embodiment, but provided below the arrow key or the<br>
button keys, for example. With such conventional arrangement,<br>
when the user operates the arrow key or the button keys, the<br>
finger of the user carelessly touches such buttons, sometimes<br>
leading to an erroneous operation. On the other hand,<br>
according to this embodiment, since the various buttons are<br>
arranged on the plane distant from the arrow key or the button<br>
keys, erroneous operations are reduced.<br>
Notches 86L and 8 6R are also formed on the lower left<br>
corner and the lower right corner of the upper part 10a of the<br>
casing 10 as on the upper left corner and the upper right<br>
corner. Below the notches 86L, grip parts 87L are provided. A<br>
hole 24 is formed in the grip part 87L to allow a strap (not<br>
shown) or the like to be passed therethrough and tied.<br>
When the portable electronic device 100 according to this<br>
embodiment is used, the forefingers are placed on the top side<br>
face of the casing 10 so that the left thumb is placed above<br>
the arrow key 20 or the analog device 22 and the right thumb<br>
is placed above the button keys 30, as described with<br>
reference to Fig. 9. The other fingers are placed so as to<br>
cover dome-like bulges on the rear face of the casing 10. In<br>
this manner, the curve formed by the forefingers fits to the<br>
shape of the left and right side faces of the casing to help<br><br>
the user's grip. At the same time, the weight of the casing 10<br>
is kept by the middle fingers to the little fingers. Therefore,<br>
even if the thumb or the forefinger is moved for operation,<br>
the remaining fingers can stably support the portable<br>
electronic device 100.<br>
Fig. 2 is a top view of the portable electronic device<br>
100. As described above, dome-like bulges 42L and 42R<br>
(hereinafter, also collectively referred to as "bulges 42")<br>
are formed on b6th ends of the rear face of the casing 10. A<br>
plane is formed between the two bulges 42. Almost the entire<br>
plane is a lid 44 of a small disk drive unit. One end of the<br>
lid 44 is pivotally supported to the lower part 10c of the<br>
casing. By sliding a switch 76 provided in the intermediate<br>
part 10b, another end of the lid 44 opens backward of the<br>
portable electronic device 100. A small disk drive unit (not<br>
shown) is housed in the casing under the open lid 44. A small<br>
disk can be loaded on the disk drive unit. The small disk<br>
provides an application program or a game program for the<br>
portable electronic device 100. Most of mechanical parts of<br>
the small disk drive unit such as optical pick-up (for example,<br>
a lens and servo system) are positioned under the right half<br>
part of the LCD 12 in Fig. 1.<br>
An L-button 46L and an R-button 46R (hereinafter, also<br>
collectively referred to as "LR-buttons 46") are buttons<br>
respectively operated by the left forefinger or left middle<br>
finger and the right forefinger or right middle finger of the<br><br>
user. The LR-buttons 46 are preferably used for giving a<br>
special instruction that cannot be commanded only with the<br>
arrow key 20 or the button keys 30. For example, when a game<br>
screen is displayed on the LCD 12, the LR-buttons 46 may be<br>
operated for a special action of a character in the game (for<br>
example, a fighting stance or a squatting position), firing a<br>
special weapon and the like.<br>
By providing the dome-like bulges 42 for grip on the rear<br>
face of the casing 10, the fingertip of the user is unlikely<br>
to touch the lid 44 of the small disk drive unit, preventing a<br>
large force from being applied to the disk drive unit.<br>
Furthermore, the dome-like bulges 42 are provided on both ends<br>
of the rear face of the casing 10. Therefore, even if the<br>
portable electronic device 100 is placed on a plane, the lid<br>
44 of the small disk drive unit does not come into contact<br>
with the plane. Further, since the impact to the small disk<br>
drive unit become smaller, stable operation of the disk drive<br>
unit is ensured, leading to decrease read errors.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the tops of the arrow key 20<br>
and the button keys 30 are higher than the maximum height of<br>
the transparent window 102 of the upper part 10a when the<br>
casing 10 is placed on a horizontal plane so that the face<br>
without the LCD 12 is oriented downward. Therefore, even if<br>
the casing 10 is placed so that the face with the LCD 12 is<br>
oriented downward, surface of the transparent window 102 over<br>
the LCD 12 is not worn. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, the<br><br>
casing 10 has a circular curve cross section so that its<br>
thickness decreases from its center toward both ends. The<br>
arrow key 20 and the button keys 30 are arranged so as to be<br>
inclined toward the ends of the casing 10 in accordance with<br>
the cross-sectional shape of the casing 10. This arrangement<br>
helps the user to grip the casing 10 and improves the<br>
operability of the arrow key 20 and the button keys 30.<br>
In the intermediate part 10b of the casing 10, an input<br>
terminal 70 for an external device and attachment holes 74 for<br>
fixing the external device to the casing 10 are provided.<br>
Using the input terminal 70 for connection with the external<br>
device, the portable electronic device 100 can be used as an<br>
input device for a personal computer or the like in place of a<br>
key board or a mouse, for example. Connection with the<br>
external device will be further described later in detail. A<br>
switch 7 6 for opening the cover of the small disk drive unit<br>
and an infrared port 88 for infrared communication module are<br>
also provided in the intermediate part 10b.<br>
Fig. 3 is a rear view of the portable electronic device<br>
100. As described above, the dome-like bulges 42R and 42L are<br>
provided on the both ends of the rear face of the portable<br>
electronic device 100. Between the bulges 42R and 42L, the lid<br>
44 of the small disk drive is provided. The dome-like bulge<br>
42R also serves as a lid for a battery box (not shown). By<br>
pressing down an oblong projection 43 and sliding the bulge<br>
42R leftward (direction to the end of the portable electronic<br><br>
device 100), the bulge 42R is detached from the casing and<br>
replaceable battery in the casing shows up.<br>
Fig. 4 is a bottom view of the portable electronic device<br>
100. As indicated with a dotted line in Fig. 4, speakers 80L<br>
and 8OR are provided in the casing 10. In front of the<br>
speakers 80L, 80R, bottom-face through holes 26L, 26R are<br>
formed on the intermediate part 10b, respectively. A plug 82<br>
for a code 84 connected to a headphone or a remote controller<br>
is inserted into jacks. The jacks will be described later with<br>
reference to Fig. 12. On the right of the upper part 10a, a<br>
terminal 66 for supplying DC power to the portable electronic<br>
device 100 is provided. On the right of the intermediate part<br>
10b, electrodes 78 are provided for supplying electric power<br>
from a so-called "cradle" to the portable electronic device<br>
100 when the portable electronic device 100 is placed on the<br>
cradle. Projections of the cradle are inserted into the<br>
bottom-face through holes 26L, 26R for supporting the portable<br>
electronic device 100 when the device 100 is placed on the<br>
cradle.<br>
Fig. 5 is a left side view of the portable electronic<br>
device 100. A WLAN switch 90 is provided in the intermediate<br>
part 10b, and an insert slot 92 for receiving a removable<br>
recording medium is provided in the lower part 10c. Fig. 6 is<br>
a right side view of the portable electronic device 100. A<br>
power switch 94 for switching ON/OFF the portable electronic<br>
device 100 is provided in the intermediate part 10b.<br><br>
Fig. 9 is a view showing how the portable electronic<br>
device 100 is gripped by the user. The portable electronic<br>
device 100 is basically operated while being held by the<br>
user's both hands. The right and left ends of the casing 10<br>
are held by the right and left hands, respectively. As shown,<br>
the user's left hand is slightly flexed to hold the casing 10<br>
along the arc shape of the left side face of the casing 10. At<br>
this time, the left thumb of the user is placed on the arrow<br>
key 20 to operate the arrow key 20. Similarly, the user's<br>
right hand is also slightly flexed to hold the casing 10 along<br>
the arc shape of the right side face of the casing 10. The<br>
right thumb of the user is placed on the center of the button<br>
keys 30 to operate the button keys 30. Only the user's<br>
forefingers or forefingers and middle fingers are slightly<br>
flexed and are placed on the LR-buttons 46. The LR-buttons 4 6<br>
are operated by the forefingers or middle fingers.<br>
The user's middle finger, ring finger and little finger,<br>
or ring finger and little finger are put on the rear face of<br>
the casing 10 while being slightly flexed to support the<br>
weight of the portable electronic device 100. As described<br>
above, the dome-like bulges 42 are provided at both ends of<br>
the rear face of the casing 10 so as to fit to the curve of<br>
the user's fingers. For example, the dome-like bulges 42 are<br>
made of a plastic material. A slip-resistant material such as<br>
a rubber or a metal material for texture may be used. Each of<br>
the dome-like bulges 42 has a smooth arc cross section as<br><br>
shown in Fig. 2 or Fig. 4. Alternatively, steps may be put on<br>
the bulges 42 for receiving the user's fingers, or a plurality<br>
of small protrusions may be formed on its surface to improve<br>
the resistance against slip. The bulges 42 make it easier to<br>
grip the portable electronic device 100. Therefore, even if<br>
the device 100 is vibrated strongly by the user while a game<br>
is being played with the device, the operability is hard to be<br>
degraded. Moreover, since the fingers and a palm are naturally<br>
flexed to fit to the arc shape of both ends of the casing 10<br>
and to the dome-like bulges 42 on the rear face of the casing<br>
10, the portable electronic device 100 fits comfortably in the<br>
user's hands. Therefore, even if the user grips the portable<br>
electronic device 100 for a long time, the user feels hardly<br>
tired. Furthermore, since the weight of the portable<br>
electronic device 100 is supported by the middle fingers, ring<br>
fingers and little fingers, the portable electronic device 100<br>
can be stably held even when the user releases his thumb or<br>
forefinger off the buttons.<br>
FIG. 10 is a functional block diagram of the portable<br>
electronic device 100. When the arrow key 20, the buttons 30a,<br>
30b, 30c, 30d, the L-button 46L, and the R-button 46R are<br>
pushed down, a digital signal in response to the push<br>
operation is input to the central processing unit 180 via<br>
interface (shown as "I/F 190" in FIG. 10) . Other buttons not<br>
shown in FIG. 10 are same. When the user takes his/her finger<br>
off the button, the button comes back to its original position.<br><br>
Operation of the analog device 22 is converted into a digital<br>
signal, and input to the central processing unit 180 via I/F<br>
190. Input signals into the infrared module 88 and the WLAN<br>
module 90 is input to the central processing unit 180 via I/F<br>
190. Sound input to the microphone 142 is converted into a<br>
digital signal, and is input to the central processing unit<br>
180. When the remote controller 140 is operated, a digital<br>
signal depending on the operation is input to the central<br>
processing unit 180 via I/F 190. The small disk drive unit 186<br>
and memory 188 is connected to the central processing unit 180.<br>
The central processing unit 180 processes various input<br>
signals with application software program recorded on the disk<br>
loaded on the small disk drive unit 186 or stored in the<br>
memory 188, and outputs image signals and audio signals as a<br>
result of the process. The image processing unit 182 treats<br>
output image signals to display images on the LCD 12. The<br>
sound processing unit 184 treats output audio signals to make<br>
sounds over the speakers 28 or the headphone 144.<br>
The portable electronic device 100 has a plurality of<br>
functions. As an example, the portable electronic device 100<br>
functions as a game machine. The user inserts a disk storing a<br>
game program therein onto the small disk drive unit 186<br>
provided on the rear face of the casing 10 to play a game.<br>
More specifically, when the power switch 94 is turned ON after<br>
loading the disk, the game program is read out from the small<br>
disk to display a start screen on the LCD 12. When the start<br><br>
button 64 is pressed in this state, the game starts. When the<br>
user operates the arrow key 20, the analog device 22, or the<br>
button keys 30 to select menu items or to operate a character<br>
displayed on the screen, the input signal is transmitted to a<br>
central processing unit 180. The central processing unit 180<br>
makes the game progress in accordance with the input signals<br>
and the game program.<br>
In another example, the portable electronic device 100<br>
also functions as a music player. The user loads a disk<br>
storing music data therein onto the small disk drive unit 18 6<br>
or inserts a removable recording medium into the slot 92 to<br>
listen to recorded music. In this case, the user uses the<br>
arrow key 20 or the analog device 22 to select a title of the<br>
song from the titles displayed on the LCD 12 which the user<br>
would like to listen to. The selected music data is converted<br>
into analog sounds by a sound processing unit 184 to be output<br>
from speakers 28 or a headphone 144.<br>
The functions of the portable electronic device 100 are<br>
not limited thereto. The portable electronic device 100 may<br>
have functions such as an address list, a schedule, a memo pad,<br>
an E-mail communication, and the like as is the case of a<br>
conventional personal digital assistant (PDA).<br>
The overall configuration of the portable electronic<br>
device 100 according to this embodiment has been described<br>
above. Next, the configuration and the function of each main<br>
component will be described in detail.<br><br>
1. Arrow key<br>
The arrow key 20 gives a discrete direction instruction<br>
for eight directions, that is, up, down, right and left, plus<br>
four directions between them. As shown in Fig. 1, the arrow<br>
key 20 comprises the convex pressed faces 20a, 20b, 20c and<br>
20d corresponding to four directions (up, down, right, and<br>
left) on the surface of the disk-like key top. The disk-like<br>
key top is tiltably supported by a supporting point 20e at the<br>
center of the key top, which is able to tilt in the eight<br>
directions. A deformation member, a conductive member, and a<br>
switch contacts are provided below each of the pressed faces<br>
20a, 20b, 20c and 20d. When any one of the pressed faces 20a,<br>
20b, 20c and 20d of the arrow key is pressed down, only the<br>
switch contacts below the pressed convex face is turned ON.<br>
The arrow key 20 is used to move a character in the vertical<br>
and horizontal directions in the game or to select an item<br>
from those listed in the menu screen. Since each of the<br>
pressed faces 20a, 20b, 20c and 20d of the arrow key 20 is<br>
formed in a convex shape, the user can perform a desired<br>
operation without directly viewing the arrow key 20. Since the<br>
top of the convex faces is formed to be higher than the<br>
maximum height of the transparent window 102 of the upper part<br>
10a, the surface of the transparent window 102 over the LCD 12<br>
can be protected from wearing even when the casing 10 is<br>
placed as the LCD 12 is oriented downward. Moreover, since the<br><br>
disk-like key top is slant toward its center in a cone shape,<br>
it is easy to put the thumb on the center to ensure the<br>
operation of the arrow key 20.<br>
2. Analog device<br>
The analog device 22 is used to continuously give a<br>
direction instruction in 360 degrees. The analog device 22<br>
includes a hole 22a formed in the front face of the casing 10,<br>
an operation pad 22b, and detection means (not shown). The<br>
operation pad 22b passes through the hole 22a and is<br>
constructed to be longitudinally and horizontally movable in<br>
the hole 22a. The operation pad 22b is made of, for example, a<br>
rubber. The detection means converts the amount of movement<br>
and the direction of movement of the operation pad 22b into an<br>
electric signal.<br>
The operation pad 22b of the analog device 22 is biased<br>
toward the center of the hole 22a by a spring or the like.<br>
When the user does not operate the operation pad 22b, the<br>
operation pad 22b is positioned in the center of the hole 22a.<br>
In operation, the user can tilt the operation pad 22b in 360<br>
degrees. Since the stroke of the tilting is set to about 2 mm,<br>
the user can tilt the operation pad 22b for minute input to<br>
great input.<br>
With such a structure, the portable electronic device 100<br>
according to the embodiment can realize the game controller<br>
with same functions as those of a so-called "joystick" and<br><br>
have high operability in spite of its small size.<br>
The input transmitted by the detection means as an<br>
electronic signal is converted into a digital signal by an<br>
analog/digital converter provided on the circuit board (not<br>
shown), which is then transmitted to the central processing<br>
unit 180. The central processing unit 180 performs a<br>
computation based on the program to display images on the LCD<br>
12 in accordance with the user's input.<br>
The input from the arrow key 20 and the input from the<br>
analog device 22 may be easily switched by the software<br>
process. Alternatively, an analog switch for switching the<br>
input between the arrow key 20 and the analog device 22 may be<br>
provided on the portable electronic device 100.<br>
3. Button keys<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the button keys 30 are composed of<br>
the buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d. On the surfaces of<br>
cylindrical key tops of the buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d,<br>
circle, triangle, square, and cross signs are printed,<br>
respectively. These buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d are used to<br>
input a single instruction. The deformation member, the<br>
conductive member, and the switch contacts described above are<br>
provided below each of the buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d. When<br>
any one of the buttons 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d is pressed down,<br>
only the switch contact just below the pressed button is<br>
turned ON. The correlation between the type of input and each<br><br>
button key differs depending on the type of the game program<br>
or the application running on the portable electronic device<br>
100. For example, the buttons keys are used for input such as<br>
an attack in a game, item acquisition, menu screen display,<br>
item selection, or response to inquiry.<br>
Each button key is arranged with predetermined spacing<br>
between the button keys so as to be placed at the four apexes<br>
of the square, as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, if the user<br>
extends the right thumb, the user can operate the triangle<br>
button and the square button on the far side when viewed from<br>
the right hand side without changing the gripping position of<br>
the casing 10. When the right thumb is flexed, the user can<br>
operate the circle button and the cross button on the close<br>
side when viewed from the right hand side. For identification<br>
of each of the buttons, protrusions or grooves and the like<br>
corresponding to circle, cross, triangle, and square signs may<br>
be provided on the surfaces of the buttons.<br>
4. LR-keys<br>
Recent video games require complicated operation. So,<br>
operation means sometimes would be short only with the arrow<br>
key and the button keys. Therefore, many controllers provide<br>
the L-button and R-button so as to increase the number of<br>
operation means. In the portable electronic device 100<br>
according to this embodiment, the LR-buttons 4 6 are provided<br>
on the top side face of the intermediate part 10b of the<br><br>
casing 10 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The LR-buttons are press-<br>
type buttons. When the LR-buttons 46 are not pressed, the LR-<br>
buttons 46 exhibit such appearance that the LR-buttons 4 6<br>
constitute a part of the intermediate part 10b. Moreover, as<br>
described above, the LR-buttons 46 are provided at the<br>
positions that the fingertips of the forefingers touch when<br>
the user grips the casing 10.<br>
By the way, when a game creator conceives the game<br>
contents, he/she must take the operability of a controller<br>
into account. In this sense, the functions of the controller<br>
and the game contents are in close relation with each other.<br>
In other words, the game contents are often restricted by the<br>
functions or the operability of the controller. The portable<br>
electronic device according to this embodiment has the<br>
operation buttons including the arrow key, the analog device,<br>
the button keys, and the LR-buttons, which are equivalent to<br>
or superior to the functions of the controller of a stay-at-<br>
home type game machine although its size is compact. Since a<br>
conventional portable game machine is not equipped with<br>
various operation buttons, the feasible game contents are<br>
restricted or a game program is required to be changed when<br>
some stay-at-home type game is ported to the portable game<br>
machine. In the portable electronic device according to this<br>
embodiment, however, such problems do not arise. Thus, the<br>
sphere of creation by game creators can be expanded.<br>
Operating means such as the arrow key, the button keys,<br><br>
or the LR-keys function as man-machine interface between the<br>
user and the portable electronic device, which is very<br>
important for the user during a game play. In other words, the<br>
operability of the casing or the functionality of the<br>
operating means of the portable electronic device is very<br>
linked to easy-to-play gaming and the fun of gaming. According<br>
to the embodiment, the portable electronic device can be<br>
provided having high operability and high extensibility in<br>
spite of its size capable of being gripped by both hands of<br>
the user.<br>
5. Speakers<br>
The portable electronic device 100 can output sounds from<br>
the front-face through holes 28L, 28R on the front face of the<br>
casing 10 and from the bottom-face through holes 26L, 26R on<br>
the bottom face of the casing 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the speakers 80L, 8OR outputting<br>
sounds are provided one by one on either side near the bottom<br>
face of the casing 10. The speakers 80L, 80R are placed<br>
substantially perpendicular to the bottom face of the casing<br>
10. The speakers 80L, 80R are placed for outputting sounds to<br>
bottom direction of the casing 10. The bottom-face through<br>
holes 26L, 26R are placed in front of the speakers 80L, 80R in<br>
the intermediate part 10b. Sounds from the speakers 80L, 80R<br>
are emitted outside of the casing 10 through the bottom-face<br>
through holes 26L, 26R. The bottom-face through holes 26L, 26R<br><br>
are formed with an upper angle toward the front face of the<br>
casing 10 such that sounds come toward the face of the user<br>
gripping the portable electronic device 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, ducts 98L, 98R are formed inside the<br>
casing 10 having a route from backside of the speakers 80L,<br>
80R to the front-face through holes 28L, 28R. With these ducts,<br>
part of sounds output from the speakers 80L, 8OR is emitted<br>
toward the face of the user gripping the casing 10. Thus, the<br>
user feels such that sounds are output from the front face of<br>
the casing 10. So, high realistic feeling is realized. These<br>
ducts may be designed as so-called bus reflex structure for<br>
emphasizing bass sounds.<br>
Since sounds are emitted to two different directions from<br>
four through holes on the front face and the bottom face of<br>
the casing 10, the realistic feeling may be improved. By these<br>
four through holes, sounds with surrounding effect may be<br>
output from the portable electronic device 100.<br>
6. Headphones<br>
FIG. 12 shows the casing 10 with plug 82 of a headphone<br>
(not shown) detached from jacks. A circular jack 146 is a jack<br>
for outputting sounds to the headphone and a rectangular jack<br>
148 is a jack for inputting from a remote controller (not<br>
shown) and a microphone (not shown) . The plug 82 has two<br>
different shaped terminals for being inserted to the jack 14 6<br>
and 148, respectively.<br><br>
7. Input terminal and power terminal<br>
As mentioned above, the input terminal 70 for external<br>
device and attachment holes 74 for fixing the external device<br>
to the casing 10. The portable electronic device 100 according<br>
to the embodiment may be used instead of, for example, an<br>
existing keyboard or a mouse as inputting device to a personal<br>
computer or so by using the input terminal 70 to be connected<br>
to the external device.<br>
In some cases, the input terminal 70 cannot supply power<br>
to the external device from the portable electronic device 100.<br>
When external device such as a camera is attached to the<br>
portable electronic device 100 for receiving data input from<br>
the external device, power terminals 72 may be provided on<br>
either side of the input terminal 70 for supplying power to<br>
the external device from the portable electronic device 100.<br>
The external device may include a camera unit or a GPS<br>
unit. With a camera unit, the portable electronic device 100<br>
may be used as general digital camera. In addition, the<br>
portable electronic device 100 may be used as a game screen by<br>
displaying the face of the user gripping the portable<br>
electronic device 100 on the LCD 12. Further, the portable<br>
electronic device 100 may be used for recognizing the user's<br>
bodily movement shot by the camera as game input. With the GPS<br>
unit, the portable electronic device 100 may be used as<br>
handheld-type GPS locator for providing location guidance or<br><br>
record of user's movement history to the user. In addition, a<br>
keyboard or a cellular phone module can be connected to the<br>
input terminal 70.<br>
Second embodiment<br>
Fig. 13 shows a front view of a portable information<br>
device according to another embodiment of the invention. As<br>
shown, the portable information device 200 comprises a LCD 210,<br>
a small stick 212, an analog / digital selecting switch 214,<br>
main buttons 216, a center board 250, a front cover 260, a<br>
left recess 280, and a right recess 282.<br>
The LCD 210 is positioned in central part of the portable<br>
information device 200 for displaying game images or movie<br>
contents. Display of LCD 210 is adjusted with predetermined<br>
luminance and color tone such that the user can view the<br>
displayed contents through the front cover 260 described later.<br>
The small stick 212 can be slanted for any direction of 360-<br>
degree, which realizes joystick function with its compact body.<br>
The slanted degree of the small stick 212 is acquired as input<br>
strength in analog manner. The analog / digital selecting<br>
switch 214 is a switch for the user to select analog or<br>
digital input from the small stick 212 in accordance with a<br>
need for the operation of a game or so. The main buttons 216<br>
are buttons printed with circle, triangle, square and cross,<br>
respectively, each having a certain function. The main buttons<br>
216 are disposed at a position of top, bottom, right and left<br><br>
part of a same circle, respectively. The small stick 212 and<br>
the main buttons 216 are used for operating a game character,<br>
for example.<br>
The LCD 210 and built-in parts such as a CPU (not shown)<br>
are mounted on a center board 250. Outer rim of the center<br>
board 250 protrudes from the casing defined with the front<br>
cover 260 and a back cover 270 described later. Since the<br>
center board 250 is made of material having certain hardness<br>
such as metal, bending stiffness of the casing may be<br>
increased.<br>
The front cover 260 is put on the front side of the<br>
center board 250 and covers built-in parts on the center board<br>
150. The front cover 260 is made of material with<br>
predetermined transparency and a color, for example a resin<br>
such as polycarbonate. The front cover 260 is molded in a<br>
unified manner. With polycarbonate having a protection effect<br>
against ultraviolet rays, the center board 250 and the built-<br>
in parts may be protected against direct light or so when the<br>
portable information device is used in the open air. The front<br>
cover 2 60 made of such a resin has a predetermined color and<br>
transparency. Therefore, the user can view displayed contents<br>
on the LCD 210 with luminance adjusted described above through<br>
the front cover 260. Thus, no transparent window needs to be<br>
formed in the casing as a conventional portable information<br>
device. Therefore, since unity of the front cover is realized,<br>
the device may provide novelty impression to the user. The<br><br>
front cover 260 may be cast from metal such as aluminum. In<br>
this case, the shape of the front cover needs to be<br>
appropriately changed for ensuring the visibility of the LCD<br>
210.<br>
The portable information device 200 is gripped with both<br>
hands or one hand by the user. The shape of the portable<br>
information device 200 is configured such that a forefinger of<br>
the user is placed on a top face and a thumb of the user is<br>
placed on a front face.<br>
On the front cover 260, substantially circular left<br>
recess 280 is provided with the small stick 212 as its center.<br>
Inside the circumference of the circle where circle, triangle,<br>
square and cross printed main buttons 216 are positioned, the<br>
right recess 282 is provided. Peripheral areas around the left<br>
recess 280 and the right recess 282 have predetermined size<br>
such that a user can hang the tip of his / her thumb on the<br>
fringe of the recess. Since the user can grip the casing with<br>
his / her thumb hanging on the left recess 280 and the right<br>
recess 282, the user can hold the portable information device<br>
stably and operate the device easily. In addition, even if the<br>
user takes his / her thumb off the joy stick when operating<br>
the small stick 212, the user can hang the thumb on the recess<br>
at once to hold the portable information device 200. So, the<br>
recess has an advantage to prevent falling of the device.<br>
Further, since the main buttons 216 are arranged at the<br>
peripheral area around the right recess 282, the user's thumb<br><br>
for operating the main buttons is received in the recess<br>
naturally. Thus, the portable information device 200 is easily<br>
held with the thumb hanging the recess, increasing holding<br>
stability of the device.<br>
The left recess 280 and the right recess 282 are arranged<br>
at symmetric position in the front face of the casing as shown.<br>
The user can grip the portable information device more<br>
naturally with the recesses. In addition, the front cover 260<br>
has a gentle curve slanted to both right and left ends of the<br>
casing such that the whole casing comprises substantially<br>
spindle shape as shown. The left recess 280 and the right<br>
recess 282 are placed on a left slope and a right slope,<br>
respectively. With such arrangement, when the user's thumb is<br>
received in the recess, pushing power of the thumb directs to<br>
the center of the casing. Thus, the user can hold the portable<br>
information device 200 more stably.<br>
FIG. 14 is a. top view of the portable information device<br>
200 according to the second embodiment. As shown, the portable<br>
information device 200 further comprises a disk cartridge slot<br>
220, group of media reproduction buttons 222, a small USB<br>
connector 224, a left shoulder switch 226, a right shoulder<br>
switch 228, an eject button 230, and a back cover 270.<br>
Into the disk cartridge slot 220, a disk cartridge<br>
storing game software, movie contents, or music contents or so<br>
is inserted. The group of media reproduction buttons 222 is<br>
provided in a part surrounded in broken line in FIG. 14. The<br><br>
details of group of media reproduction buttons 222 are also<br>
shown in enlarged version for better understanding. The group<br>
of media reproduction buttons 222 is a group for controlling<br>
the reproduction of music contents or movie contents, which<br>
includes a play button, a fast-forwarding button, a fast-<br>
rewinding button, a stop button and a suspending button in a<br>
left-to-right fashion. The small USB connector 224 is a<br>
connector for connecting a personal computer or so to the<br>
portable information device 200, for example. Each of the left<br>
shoulder switch 226 and the right shoulder switch 228 is<br>
mainly operated by a forefinger of the user, which is used for<br>
operating a game character same as the small stick 212 and the<br>
main buttons 216 described with reference to FIG. 13. The<br>
eject button 230 is a button for ejecting a disk cartridge<br>
inserted into the disk cartridge slot 220.<br>
The back cover 270 is put on the back side of the center<br>
board 250. The back cover 270 and the front cover 260 define<br>
the casing of the portable information device 200. The back<br>
cover 270 is also made of resin or metal same with the front<br>
cover 260. However, it is preferable that the back cover 270<br>
is made of material having a certain frictional resistance. By<br>
employing material with raising fabric on its surface or with<br>
such finishing on its surface for example, friction is made<br>
between user's hand and the material. With such material,<br>
gripping feeling is increased. Such material functions as<br>
antislin when the Dortable information device 200 is gripped<br><br>
by hands, enabling stable holding. In another example, the<br>
back cover 270 may be made of leather or rubber, for example.<br>
FIG. 15 is a back view of the portable information device<br>
200 according to the second embodiment. As shown, the portable<br>
information device 200 further comprises a battery 232, a<br>
transparent member 234, a stand 236, a memory slot 238, and an<br>
AC adapter jack insertion slot 240.<br>
The battery 232 supplies power for drive the portable<br>
information device 200. The battery 232 is configured to be<br>
detachable from the portable information device 200. The user<br>
charges the battery by a battery charger (not shown). In<br>
another example, the battery 232 is fixed to the portable<br>
information device 200. In this case, the battery may be<br>
charged by the AC adapter (not shown) through the AC adapter<br>
jack insertion slot 240 described later. The transparent<br>
member 234 is provided such that the user can view the<br>
operating state of the disk cartridge by the user. Thus, the<br>
user can view the rotation of the disk cartridge loaded in the<br>
disk cartridge slot 220 described in FIG. 14. This also<br>
contributes to good design of the device. The stand 236 is a<br>
two-support-type member for standing the portable information<br>
device 200 on a table so that the user can view movie contents<br>
or so instead of holding the device 200 by hands. The memory<br>
slot 238 is an insertion slot for a recording medium storing<br>
contents such as game, movie or music. To the AC adapter jack<br>
insertion slot, a jack of the AC adapter (not shown) is<br><br>
inserted for directly acquiring power for driving the portable<br>
information device 200 without the battery 232 from home power<br>
supply, for example. As stated above, this AC adapter may be<br>
used to supply power to the battery 232.<br>
FIG. 16 is a front view of a portable information device<br>
300 according to a first variation of the second embodiment.<br>
Only a difference with FIG. 13 is described herein. In this<br>
variation, four corners of the casing and four corners of the<br>
center board 250 projecting from the casing have a round shape.<br>
With this, when the user operates the left shoulder switch 226<br>
or the right shoulder switch 228 (not shown) by his / her<br>
forefinger, the casing fits comfortably in his / her hand and<br>
the user can operate the switches without discomfort. The<br>
shape of whole casing is designed roundly, so fresh impression<br>
can be provided. Furthermore, two-support-type gripping part<br>
312 is housed in either side of the casing 10 of the portable<br>
information device 300. The user may pull out the gripping<br>
parts as needed and hold the portable information device 300<br>
stably with them.<br>
FIG. 17 is a front view of a portable information device<br>
400 according to a second variation of the second embodiment.<br>
Only a difference with FIG. 13 is described herein. In this<br>
variation, upper left corner and upper right corner of the<br>
casing and the center board 250 projecting from the casing<br>
have a round shape. Thus, there is same advantage with the<br>
first variation in regard to the operation of the left<br><br>
shoulder switch 226 and the right shoulder switch 228. In this<br>
variation, lower right corner and lower left corner of the<br>
casing and the center board 250 projecting from the casing are<br>
formed substantially right angle same with the portable<br>
information device 200 in FIG. 13. Hence, holding stability of<br>
the casing by the user is not decreased at these corners.<br>
FIG. 18 is a front view of a portable information device<br>
500 according to a third variation of the second embodiment.<br>
Only a difference with FIG. 13 is described herein. This<br>
