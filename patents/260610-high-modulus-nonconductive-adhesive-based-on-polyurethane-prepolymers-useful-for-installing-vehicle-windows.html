HIGH MODULUS, NONCONDUCTIVE ADHESIVE BASED ON POLYURETHANE PREPOLYMERS USEFUL FOR INSTALLING VEHICLE WINDOWS<br>
Field of Invention<br>
(0001) The invention relates to a composition useful as an adhesive which is useful in bonding glass into vehicles and buildings which adhesive demonstrates high modulus and nonconductive properties. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of bonding two or more substrates together, wherein such substrates may include glass, buildings and vehicles. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of replacing a window in a vehicle using the composition of the invention.<br><br>
Background of Invention<br>
(2)	Adhesive compositions are used to affix (bond) glass (windows) into buildings and vehicles, see Rizk, U.S. 4,780,520; Bhat, US 5,976,305; Hsieh et al, U.S. 6,015,475 and Zhou, U.S. Patent 6,709,539, all incorporated herein by reference. In automobile factories windows are installed using robots and computer controlled processing. This facilitates the use of a variety of high performance adhesives used on a variety of automobiles, for instance nonconductive adhesives and high modulus adhesives. Further, new vehicles are not driven a significant distance for several days after window installation, and thus the speed of cure is not a significant issue. Conversely, when a vehicle needs a window replaced, it is often performed in a remote location by an installer working from a vehicle. In this environment, speed of cure is important as the vehicle owner desires to drive the vehicle away as soon as possible after installation on the window. Adhesives useful in replacing windows for vehicles which facilitate fast drive away times are known see Bhat, U.S. 5,976,305 and Zhou, U.S. Patent 6,709,539. The introduction of various high performance adhesive compositions used for installing windows in automobile factories presents a problem for replacement window installers. First adhesives that meet all the varied performance requirements are not available in the market place. Second, it is difficult to formulate many high performance adhesive compositions to allow rapid drive away times, such as one hour and more preferably 30 minutes. Thus, a replacement window installer often has tQ cany a variety of adhesives so that the installer can match the adhesive to the properties of the original adhesive. It is also difficult to formulate a high performance adhesive that does not sag, that is, lose the shape of the adhesive bead applied to the vehicle or the glass.<br>
(3)	Adhesives have been developed which provide good initial green strength that allows the adhesive to hold the glass in place without additional fixturing to hold the glass in place. This is achieved through the inclusion of crystalline polyesters in the adhesive. These adhesives have hot melt properties that require that the adhesive be melted and applied hot. As the adhesive cools the polyester portion crystallizes and provides initial green strength to hold the glass in place, see Proebster, U.S. 5,747,581,<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference. The problem with these adhesives is that they require heat to apply and the use of complex equipment including a heater for their use. The initial green strength provided is not sufficient for rapid drive away time. In the replacement glass industry segment rapid strength development is necessary to allow safe rapid drive away times. Because of the use of hot melt adhesives in the automobile window replacement market, many installers insist on heating adhesives prior to applying the adhesive to the window or the window flange. Many adhesives when heated demonstrate sagging, that is the deformation as the result of gravitational forces. This deformation if severe enough can interfere in the proper installation and sealing of the window into the vehicle.<br>
(4)	Several approaches to providing non-conductive adhesives including using non-conductive carbon black in adhesive formulations are known, see commonly assigned Patent Publication Number 2005-0054764 titled COMPOSITION USEFUL AS AN ADHESIVE FOR INSTALLING VEHICLE WINDOWS. WO 02/053671 discloses the use of low or non-oixidized carbon black with polycarbonate based polyols to achieve this objective. The problem with this technology is that low conductive carbon black and polycarbonate polyols are significantly more expensive than standard grades of carbon black which are conductive.<br>
(5)	Windows in buildings and vehicles are installed and replaced in a variety of environmental conditions. Many of the present adhesive compositions are limited with respect to the environmental conditions of application. As a result window installers often need to use different adhesives based on the environmental conditions.<br>
(6)	What is needed is a composition which is useful as an adhesive for bonding glass into a structure which exhibits a variety of high performance properties (such as high modulus and nonconductive nature), exhibits fast safe drive away times when applied under a variety of conditions, fast strength development, can be applied without the need for heating the adhesive, can be applied under a wide range of environmental conditions, does not require expensive ingredients and does not sag when applied. Further,<br><br>
what is needed is an adhesive composition which does not sag when heated prior to application to temperatures of up to 80°C.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
(0007)	in one embodiment, the invention is a composition comprising<br>
a)	one or more isocyanate functional polyether based prepolymers containing one or more organic based polymers dispersed therein;<br>
b)	one or more isocyanate functional polyester based prepolymers which is solid at 23°C;<br>
c)	one or more polyisocyanates having a nominal functionality of about 3 or greater;<br>
d)	one or more conductive carbon blacks in an amount such that the composition has a dielectric constant of about 15 or less; and<br>
e)	one or more catalysts for the reaction of isocyanate moieties with hydroxyl groups, wherein the composition demonstrates upon cure a modulus of about 2.0 MPa or greater a 25°C measured according to ASTM D4065; a dielectric constant of about 15 or less; a sag of an uncured sample of less than about 2 mm, a press flow viscosity of about 20 to about 50 seconds and a storage modulus of about 5.3X103 Pa or greater.<br><br>
(8)	In another embodiment the invention is a method of bonding two or more substrates together which comprises contacting the two or more substrates together with a composition according to this invention disposed along at least a portion of the area wherein the substrates are in contact.<br>
(9)	In yet another embodiment the invention is a method of replacing a window of a vehicle comprising:<br>
i) removing the window from the vehicle;<br>
ii) applying a composition according to the invention to a replacement window or to the<br>
flange of the vehicle adapted to hold the window into the vehicle;<br>
iii) contacting the flange of the vehicle and the replacement window with the composition<br>
disclosed between the replacement window and the flange of the vehicle; and<br>
iv) allowing the adhesive to cure.<br>
(0010)	The composition of the invention is useful as an adhesive to bond<br>
substrates together. A variety of substrates may be bonded together using the composition<br>
for instance, plastics, glass, wood, ceramics, metal, coated substrates, such as plastics with<br>
an abrasion resistant coating disposed thereon, and the like. The compositions of the<br><br>
invention may be used to bond similar and dissimilar substrates together. The compositions are especially useful for bonding glass or a plastic with an abrasion resistant coating disposed thereon to other substrates such as vehicles and buildings. The compositions of the invention are also useful in bonding parts of modular components together, such as vehicle modular components. The glass or plastic with an abrasion resistant coating disposed thereon can be bonded to coated and uncoated portions of vehicles. Advantageously the adhesive is pumpable, sag resistant and bonds parts together at temperatures between about 20°C and about 80°C. This allows the adhesives prepared from the composition of the invention to be applied at a wide range of temperatures. Heated application machinery is not necessary for the application of the adhesive. Furthermore, the adhesive demonstrates rapid strength development which facilitates rapid drive away times of preferably one hour, and more preferably 30 minutes, after application of the adhesive at temperatures of from about 0 °F(-18°C) to about 115°F (46°C). In particular, windshields installed under such conditions meet United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 212. The compositions of the invention are nonconductive and demonstrate a dielectric constant of about 15 or less. The compositions of the invention preferably demonstrate a modulus after application for two weeks of about 2 MPa or greater, more preferably about 2.2 MPa or greater and preferably about 3 MPa or less according to ASTM D4065. The compositions of the invention exhibit a storage modulus, G', of about 5.3 x 103 Pa or greater, preferably about .53 MPa or greater and most preferably about 1.0 MPa or greater. Pumpability of the composition can be measured according to the press flow viscosity test described hereinafter; according to that test the composition exhibits a press flow viscosity of about 20 to about 50 seconds.<br><br>

Detailed Description of Invention<br>
(12)	One or more as used herein means that at least one, or more than one. of the recited components may be used as disclosed. Nominal as used with respect to functionality means the theoretical functionality. This can be calculated from the stoichiometry of the ingredients used. Generally, the actual functionality is different due to imperfections in raw material, incomplete conversion of the reactants and formation of byproducts.<br>
(13)	The one or more isocyanate functional polyether based prepolymers are present in sufficient quantity to provide adhesive character to the composition. Such prepolymers have an average isocyanate functionality sufficient to allow the preparation of a crosslinked polyurethane upon cure and not so high that the polymers are unstable. Stability in this context means that the prepolymer or adhesive prepared from the prepolymer has a shelf life of at least 6 months at ambient temperatures, in that it does not demonstrate an increase in viscosity during such period which prevents its application or use. Preferably, the prepolymer or adhesive prepared therefrom does not undergo an increase in viscosity of more than about 50 percent during the stated period. The prepolymer preferably has a free isocyanate content which facilitates acceptable strength in adhesives prepared from the prepolymers 60 minutes after application and stability of the prepolymer. Preferably, the free isocyanate content is about 0.8 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the prepolymer and more preferably about 0.9 percent by weight or greater, and preferably about 2.2 percent by weight or less, more preferably about 2.0 percent or less, even more preferably about 1.4 percent by weight or less and even more preferably about 1.1 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 1.0 percent by weight or less. Above about 2.2 percent by weight, the adhesives prepared from the prepolymer may demonstrate lap shear strengths after 60 minutes which are too low for the intended use. Below about 0.8 percent by weight the prepolymer viscosity is too high to handle and the working time is too short.<br>
(14)	The prepolymer preferably exhibits a viscosity, which facilitates formulation of a pumpable adhesive which has good green strength. Preferably, the<br><br>
viscosity of the prepolymer is about 100,000 centipoise (]00Pa s) or less and more preferably about 70,000 centipoise (70Pa s)) or less, and most preferably about 45,000 centipoise (45Pa s) or less and about 30,000 centipoise (30Pa s) or greater. The viscosity used herein is Brookfield viscosity determined using a number 5 spindle. The viscosity of the adhesive can be adjusted with fillers, although the fillers generally do not improve the green strength of the final adhesive. Below about 30,000 centipoise (30 Pa s) the adhesive prepared from the prepolymer may exhibit poor green strength. Above about 100,000 (1 OOPa s) the prepolymer may be unstable and hard to dispense. The prepolymer may be prepared by any suitable method, such as by reacting polyols, such as diols, triols and dispersion triols such as a copolymer polyol or grafted polyol, with an excess over stoichiometry of one or more polyisocyanates under reaction conditions sufficient to form a prepolymer having isocyanate functionality and free isocyanate content which meets the criteria discussed above. In a preferable method used to prepare the prepolymer, the polyisocyanates are reacted with one or more diols, one or more triols and one or more dispersion triols.<br>
(15)	Preferable polyisocyanates for use in preparing the prepolymer include those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,922,809 at column 3, line 32 to column 4, line 24 incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the polyisocyanate is an aromatic or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate such as diphenylmethane^^'-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, tetramethylxylenediisocyanate, and is most preferably diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate. The diols and triols are generically referred to as polyols. Polyols useful in this invention are diols and triols corresponding to the polyols described in U.S. Patent 5,922,809 at column 4, line 60 to column 5, line 50, incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the polyols (diols and triols) are polyether polyols and more preferably polyoxyalkylene oxide polyols. Most preferred triols are ethylene oxide-capped polyols prepared by reacting glycerin with propylene oxide, followed by reacting the product with ethylene oxide.<br>
(16)	Preferably, the prepolymer contains one or more organic based polymers dispersed therein. Preferably, the organic based polymer is included in the<br><br>
prepolymer by inclusion of a dispersion triol having dispersed therein particles of an organic based polymer. The preferable dispersion triols are disclosed in Zhou, U.S. Patent 6.709,539 at column 4, line 13 to column 6, line 18. incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the triol used to disperse the organic particles is a polyether triol and more preferably a polyoxyalkylene based triol. Preferably, such polyoxyalkylene oxide triol comprises a polyoxypropylene chain with a polyoxyethylene end cap. Preferably, the triols used have a molecular weight of about 4,000 or greater, more preferably about 5,000 or greater and most preferably about 6,000 or greater. Preferably, such triol has molecular weight of about 8,000 or less and more preferably about 7,000 or less.<br>
(0017) Preferably, the particles dispersed in the dispersion triol comprise a thermoplastic polymer, rubber-modified thermoplastic polymer or a polyurea dispersed in a triol. The polyurea preferably comprises the reaction product of a polyamine and a polyisocyanate. Preferable thermoplastic polymers are those based on monovinylidene aromatic monomers and copolymers of monovinylidene aromatic monomers with conjugated dienes, acrylates, methacrylates, unsaturated nitriles or mixtures thereof. The copolymers can be block or random copolymers. More preferably the particles dispersed in the triol comprise copolymers of unsaturated nitriles, conjugated dienes and a monovinylidene aromatic monomer, a copolymer of an unsaturated nitrile and a monovinylidene aromatic monomer or a polyurea. Even more preferably the particles comprise a polyurea or polystyrene-acrylonitrile copolymer with the polystyrene-acrylonitrile copolymers being most preferred. The organic polymer particles dispersed in the triol preferably have a particle size which is large enough to improve the impact properties and elastomeric properties of the finally cured adhesive, but not so large so as to reduce the ultimate strength of the adhesive after cure. The particles may be dispersed in the triol or grafted to the backbone of some of the triols. Preferably, the particle size is about 10 microns or greater and more preferably the particle size is about 20 microns or greater. Preferably, the particle size is about 50 microns or less and more preferably the particle size is about 40 microns or less. The triol dispersion contains a sufficient amount of organic polymer particles such that the adhesive upon cure has sufficient hardness for the desired use and not so much such that the cured adhesive has too much elasticity as<br><br>
defined by elongation. Preferably, the dispersion contains about 20 percent by weight or greater of organic polymer particles copolymer based on the dispersion, preferably about 30 percent by weight or greater and more preferably about 35 percent by weight or greater. Preferably, the dispersion contains about 60 percent by weight or less of organic polymer particles based on the dispersion, preferably about 50 percent by weight or less and more preferably about 45 percent by weight or less.<br>
(18)	The poiyols (diols and triols and dispersion triols) are present in an amount sufficient to react with most of the isocyanate groups of the isocyanates leaving enough isocyanate groups to correspond with the desired free isocyanate content of the prepolymer. Preferably, the poiyols are present in an amount of about 30 percent by weight or greater based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 40 percent by weight or greater and most preferably about 55 percent by weight or greater. Preferably, the poiyols are present in an amount of about 75 percent by weight or less based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 65 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 60 percent by weight or less.<br>
(19)	The weight ratio of diols to triols and dispersion triols is important to achieving the desired cure rate and strength of the adhesive. If the weight ratio is too low the formulation is too viscous to handle and the resulting adhesive has insufficient elasticity to retain glass in an automobile window frame under crash conditions. If the ratio is too high the adhesive does not have adequate green strength. The weight ratio of diol to triol and dispersion triol is preferably about 0.8 or greater and more preferably about 0.85 or greater and most preferably about 0.9 or greater. The weight ratio of diol to triol and dispersion triol is about 1.2 or less; more preferably about 1.0 or less and most preferably about 0.95 or less. In the embodiment where the poiyols comprise a mixture of diols and triols, the amount of diols present is preferably about 15 percent by weight or greater based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 25 percent by weight or greater and most preferably about 28 percent by weight or greater; and about 40 percent by weight or less based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 35 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 30 percent by weight or less. In the embodiment where the poiyols<br><br>
comprise a mixture of diols and triols, the amount of triols (non dispersion trio! and dispersion triol) present is preferably about 15 percent by weight or greater based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 25 percent by weight or greater and most preferably about 28 percent by weight or greater; and preferably about 45 percent by weight or less based on the prepolymer, more preferably about 35 percent by weight or less and most preferably about 32 percent by weight or less.<br>
(20)	The dispersion of organic polymer particles in a triol is present in the prepolymer in an amount of about 10 percent by weight or greater of the prepolymer and more preferably about 12 percent by weight or greater, and about 18 percent by weight or less of the prepolymer and more preferably about 15 percent by weight or less.<br>
(21)	The polyurethane prepolymers of the invention may further comprise a plasticizer. The plasticizers useful in the prepolymer are common plasticizers useful in polyurethane adhesive applications and well known to those skilled in the art. The plasticizer is present in an amount sufficient to disperse the prepolymer in the final adhesive composition. The plasticizer can be added to the adhesive either during preparation of the prepolymer or during compounding of the adhesive composition. Preferably, the plasticizer is present in about 1 percent by weight or greater of the prepolymer formulation (prepolymer plus plasticizer), more preferably about 20 percent by weight or greater and most preferably about 30 percent by weight or greater. Preferably,<br>
he plasticizer is present in about 45 percent by weight or less of the prepolymer<br>
ormulation and more preferably about 35 percent by weight or less.<br>
(0022)	The polyurethane prepolymer may be prepared by any suitable<br>
nethod, such as bulk polymerization and solution polymerization. Preferable processes for<br>
he preparation of the prepolymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,922,809 at column 9, line<br>
i to 51 incorporated herein by reference. The polyurethane prepolymers are present in the dhesive composition in an amount sufficient such that when the resulting adhesive cures ubstrates are bound together. Preferably, the polyurethane prepolymers are present in an mount of about 25 parts by weight based on 100 parts of the adhesive composition or reater, more preferably about 30 parts by weight or greater and most preferably about 35<br><br>
parts by weight or greater. Preferably, the polyurethane prepolymers are present in an amount of about 55 parts by weight based on 100 parts of the adhesive composition or less, more preferably about 50 parts by weight or less and even more preferably about 45 parts by weight or less.<br>
(0023) The composition further comprises one or more isocyanate functional prepolymers containing one or more polyester based polyols which are solid at ambient temperature, about 23°C. The polyester based polyols have melting points such that the prepolymer provides sufficient green strength to prevent the substrates from moving in relation to one another due to gravitational forces and such that the prepolymer is solid at ambient temperatures. In terms of installing a window in a vehicle or building, the polyester based prepolymer prevents the window from sliding after installation. Preferably, the polyester polyols have melting points of about 40°C or greater, even more preferably about 45°C or greater and most preferably about 50°C or greater. Preferably, the polyester polyols exhibit melting points of about 85°C or less and most preferably about 70°C or less and even more preferably about 60°C or less. The polyester based isocyanate prepolymer can be prepared using one or more polyester polyols. The amount of polyester polyol in the prepolymer is a sufficient amount to provide the needed green strength to the composition of the invention and to render it solid. Preferably, the polyester polyol is present in the polyester polyol based isocyanate prepolymer in an amount of about 70 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the prepolymer and more preferably about 80 percent by weight or greater. Preferably, the polyester polyol is present in the polyester polyol based isocyanate prepolymer in an amount of about 95 percent by weight or less based on the weight of the prepolymer and more preferably about 90 percent by weight or less. Preferably, the polyester polyol based isocyanate prepolymer is present in the adhesive composition in sufficient amount to give the needed green strength and the desired rheology of the composition. Preferably, the polyester polyol based isocyanate prepolymer is present in the adhesive composition in an amount of about 1 part by weight or greater based on 100 parts by weight of the adhesive composition and most preferably about 2 parts by weight or greater. Preferably, the polyester polyol based isocyanate prepolymer is present in the adhesive composition in an amount of about 5 parts by weight<br><br>
or less based on 100 pails of the adhesive composition and most preferably about 3 parts by weight or less. The polyester polyol can be any polyester composition that meets the property requirements defined, which is crystalline at ambient temperatures and melts in the desired temperature range. Preferred polyester polyols are prepared from linear diacids and linear diols. A more preferred diacid is adipic acid. More preferred diols are the C2-6 diols, with butane diols, pentane diols and hexane diols being most preferred. The polyester based polyisocyanate prepolymers can be prepared using the processes and isocyanates described hereinbefore. Preferred polyester polyols are available from Creanova under the trade name Dynacol and the designations 7360 and 7330, with Dynacol 7360 polyester polyols, more preferred.<br>
(0024) The composition of the invention further comprises a polyfunctional isocyanate for the purpose of improving the modulus of the composition in the cured form. Polyfunctional as used in the context of the isocyanates refers to isocyanates having a functionality of 3 or greater. The poly isocyanates can be any monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric isocyanate having a nominal functionality of about 3 or greater. More preferably the polyfunctional isocyanate has a nominal functionality of about 3.2 or greater. Preferably, the polyfunctional isocyanate has a nominal functionality of about 5 or less, even more preferably about 4.5 or less and most preferably about 4.2 or less. The polyfunctional isocyanate can be any isocyanate which is reactive with the active hydrogen containing compounds used in the composition or water and which improves the modulus of the cured composition. The polyisocyanates can be monomeric; trimers, isocyanurates or biurets of monomeric isocyanates; oligomeric or polymeric, the reaction product of several units of one or more monomeric isocyanates. Examples of preferred polyfunctional isocyanates include trimers of hexamethylene diisocyanate, such as those available from Bayer under the trademark and designation Desmodur N3300, and polymeric isocyanates such as polymeric MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanates) such as those marketed by The Dow Chemical Company under the trademark of PAPFM including PAPI ™ 20 polymeric isocyanate.

(35)	As used herein all parts by weight relative to the components of the adhesive composition are based on 100 total parts by weight of the adhesive composition.<br>
(36)	The adhesive composition of this invention may be formulated by blending the components together using means well known in the art. Generally, the components are blended in a suitable mixer. Such blending is preferably conducted in an inert atmosphere in the absence of oxygen and atmospheric moisture to prevent premature reaction. It may be advantageous to add any plasticizers to the reaction mixture for preparing the isocyanate containing prepolymer so that such mixture may be easily mixed and handled. Alternatively, the plasticizers can be added during blending of all the components. Once the adhesive composition is formulated, it is packaged in a suitable container such that it is protected from atmospheric moisture and oxygen.

(37)	The adhesive composition of the invention is used to bond a variety of substrates together as described hereinbefore. The composition can be used to bond porous and nonporous substrates together. The adhesive composition is applied to a substrate and the adhesive on the first substrate is thereafter contacted with a second substrate. In preferred embodiments, the surfaces to which the adhesive is applied are cleaned and primed prior to application, see for example, U.S. Patents 4,525,511; 3,707,521 and 3,779,794; relevant parts of all are incorporated herein by reference. Generally the adhesives of the invention are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result in curing<br><br>
of the adhesive. Curing can be accelerated by the addition of additional water or by applying heat to the curing adhesive by means of convection heat, microwave heating and the like.  Preferably, the adhesive of the invention is formulated to provide a working time of about 6 minutes or greater more preferably about 10 minutes or greater. Preferably, the working time is about 15 minutes or less and more preferably about 12 minutes or less.<br>
(38)	The adhesive composition is preferably used to bond glass or plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating, to other substrates such as metal or plastics.

The plastic coated with an abrasion resistant coating can be any plastic which is clear, such as polycarbonate, acrylics, hydrogenated polystyrene or hydrogenated styrene conjugated diene block copolymers having greater than 50 percent styrene content. The coating can comprise any coating which is abrasion resistant such as a polysiloxane coating. Preferably, the coating has an ultraviolet pigmented light blocking additive. Preferably, the glass or plastic window has an opaque coating disposed in the region to be contacted with the adhesive to block UV light from reaching the adhesive.<br>
(39)	In a preferred embodiment the composition of the invention is used to replace windows in structures or vehicles and most preferably in vehicles. The first step is removal of the previous window. This can be achieved by cutting the bead of the adhesive holding the old window in place and then removing the old window. Thereafter the new window is cleaned and primed. The old adhesive that is located on the window flange can be removed, although it is not necessary and in most cases it is left in place. The window flange is preferably primed with a paint primer. The adhesive is applied in a bead to the periphery of the window located such that it will contact the window flange when placed in the vehicle. The window with the adhesive located thereon is then placed into the flange with the adhesive located between the window and the flange. The adhesive<br><br>
bead is a continuous bead that functions to seal the junction between the window and the window flange. A continuous bead of adhesive is a bead that is located such that the bead connects at each end to form a continuous seal between the window and the flange when contacted. Thereafter the adhesive is allowed to cure.<br>
(40)	In another embodiment the compositions of the invention can be used to bond modular components together. Examples of modular components include vehicle modules, such as door, window or body.<br>
(41)	Viscosities as described herein are determined according to the procedure disclosed in Bhat, U.S. Patent 5,922, 809 at column 12 lines 38 to 49, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
(42)	Molecular weights as described herein are determined according to the following to the procedure disclosed in Bhat U.S. Patent 5,922, 809 at column 12 lines 50 to 64, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
(43)	In reference to polyurethane prepolymers, average isocyanate functionality is determined according to the procedure disclosed in Bhat, U.S. Patent 5,922, 809 at column 12 lines 65 to Column 13, line 26, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Illustrative Embodiments of the Invention<br>
(0044)	The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention, but<br>
are not intended to limit the scope thereof. All parts and percentages are by weight unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br><br>
Preparation of Polyether Prepolymer<br>
(0045)	A polyether polyurethane prepolymer was prepared by mixing 980 g<br>
of a polyoxypropylene diol having an average molecular weight of 2,000 with 595 g of a<br>
polyoxypropylene triol having an average molecular weight of 4500 and 455 g of a styrene<br>
acrylonitrile dispersed polyoxypropylene triol with an average molecular weight of 5400.<br>
Mixing was carried out in a reactor by heating the mixture to 48°C. 320 g of<br>
dipheylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate and 0.17 g of stannous octoate were added to the<br>
mixture. The whole mixture was then reacted for one hour at 80°C. Finally, 1120 g of a<br>
dialkyl phthalate plasticizer was added to the mixture and the mixing was continued for<br>
one hour.<br>
Preparation of Polyester Prepolvmer 1<br>
(0046)	A polyester polyurethane prepolymer was prepared by charging 150<br>
g of diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (MDI) to a reaction vessel and heating to 48°C.<br>
Then 850 g of molten linear polyester diol (Dynacol 7360) was slowly added and allowed<br>
to react for thirty minutes with a maximum allowable temperature of 88°C.<br>
Preparation of Polyester Prepolvmer 2<br>
(0047)	A polyester polyurethane prepolymer was prepared by charging 175<br>
g of a dialkyl phthalate plasticizer to a reaction vessel and heating to 48°C. To this 108 g<br>
of diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate was added and mixed to insure that the MDI was<br>
molten.   Then 717 g of molten linear copolyester diol (Dynacol 7330) was slowly added<br>
and allowed to react for thirty minutes. The maximum temperature allowed is 88°C. The<br>
polyester used demonstrated a melting point of 80-85°C.<br><br>
Compounding of Adhesives<br>
(48)	All of the adhesives were made according to the following compounding procedure using the raw material percentages listed in Table 1 below. The only change between the different formulations is the compounding temperature. Adhesives without the polyester prepolymers were compounded at room temperature; otherwise, the mixing vessel was heated to 55°C for the polyester polyurethane prepolymers.<br>
(49)	The mixing vessel was heated to the desired temp if the polyester polyurethane prepolymer were used. The appropriate amounts of polyether prepolymer and multifunctional isocyanate (Desmodur® N3300 or PAPI™ 2020) were charged to the vessel and degassed under vacuum for 15 minutes. The polyester polyurethane prepolymers were then added and the materials were degassed under vacuum for an additional 15 minutes. The carbon black and clay fillers were added and mixed for five minutes at slow speed under vacuum until the fillers were sufficiently wetted by the prepolymers. The mixing speed was increased and the fillers dispersed for 20 minutes. Finally, the dimorpholino diethyl ether and bismuth octoate catalysts and the N-methyl pyrolidone were added to the mixing vessel and the mixture was mixed under vacuum for an additional 10 minutes.<br>
Testing Procedures<br>
(50)	G-Modulus: The shear modulus of the fully cured adhesives was determined by Instron at 10 percent and 20 percent strain. A lap shear sample was made with 5 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm dimension and fully cured prior to testing.<br>
(51)	Storage Modulus (Green Strength) at Short Cure Times: The storage modulus of the adhesives was determined at short cure times through the use of a Dynamic Stress Rheometer (DSR). The DSR was programmed to apply a stress at a frequency of five rad/sec using 8 mm parallel plate geometry with a plate separation height of 1 mm. The adhesive sample was applied to the plates and the storage modulus was recorded every 2 minutes for the first two hours after dispensing at the indicated temperatures.<br><br>
(52)	High Temperature Sag Test: An 8 mm by 12 mm isosceles triangle bead of the adhesive is dispensed with a standard caulking gun onto a surface held at a 60° angle from horizontal. Acceptable performance is a minimal deflection of the bead tip; no defection or change in shape is preferred. The test used was conducted on the adhesives after aging for 10 hours at 80°C. The adhesives were dispensed while still hot at 80°C and the amount of sag was recorded as the number of mm of deflection of the bead tip.<br>
(53)	Press Flow Viscosity: The press flow viscosity is determined as the time (seconds) required to extrude 20 grams of adhesive through a capillary. The width of the capillary is fixed at 0.203 in (5.1 mm) and the applied pressure is 80 psi (5.5 x 10s Pa). Unless otherwise noted, all press flow viscosity values were determined at 23+/-l°C.<br>
Results<br>
(54)	The dielectric constant of the fully cured adhesive was determined by using a Hewlett Packard 4396A Network/Spectrum Analyzer PC, as per DIN 53482 test.<br>
(55)	Table 1 describes the formulations tested and the results.<br>
(56)	The tested adhesives can be dispensed at room temperature (typically demonstrating a press flow viscosity range of between 20 and 50 seconds for materials that will be applied with a caulking gun).<br><br><br>
(0057) Table 2 Illustrates formulations made as described by Example 2 above with different carbon black formulations.<br><br><br>
(0058)	The sag performance of examples 3-10 is excellent, the carbons used<br>
had the properties of Oil Absorption Number (OAN) of 60 or greater, and surface area of<br>
31 m2/g or greater. The low conductivity requirement is demonstrated by each of these adhesives by demonstrating a dielectric constant of less than 15.<br>
(0059)	Table 3 demonstrates dielectric constant versus carbon black levels<br>
used. Standard Cabot carbon black was used in Examples 13-19. The data shows that the<br>
dielectric constant increases with the increased amount of carbon usage. The adhesives<br>
meet low conductive specification when conductive carbon is used at 20 percent or less and<br>
demonstrate excellent rheology properties. Figure 1 presents the data of Table 3 in graphic<br>
form which graphs the percent carbon black verses the dielectric constant.<br><br><br><br>
