DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF OPERATING A RADIO STATION<br>
The invention relates to a method of operating a radio station. The invention has application in, particularly but not exclusively, mobile terminals suitable for use in a mobile communication system such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) or cdma2000.<br>
Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Services (MBMS) are currently being introduced to the UMTS specifications Release 6. This will enable efficient delivery of multimedia services to multiple mobile terminals simultaneously. In UMTS, a mobile terminal is referred to as a User Equipment, or UE.<br>
One feature currently under specification is Frequency Layer Convergence (FLC) where the network sends an indication of a preferred frequency (also referred to as a "preferred layer", PL) for a point-to-multipoint MBMS service, so that UEs that intend to join a particular service switch to the PL of that service in order to receive the service. As a result, the number of UEs gathered on the same frequency for the purpose of receiving an MBMS service may be quite high.<br>
When a high number of UEs is receiving the same point-to-multipoint MBMS service on the same PL, they will be camping on that frequency for the duration of the MBMS session. Once the transmission of the MBMS service has stopped, the UEs will start signalling on the network for their next service, for example making a call, receiving a short message service (SMS), or subscribing to another MBMS service. Some UEs may be able to receive simultaneously a MBMS service together with another service such as a dedicated or point-to-point service (e.g. voice call). In the case of a UE that would not be able to receive both simultaneous services, it might have to reduce its data rate on the non-point-to-multipoint MBMS service in order to receive the MBMS service. When the MBMS service terminates, the UE would then have to start signalling in order to increase its data rate again and restart the non-MBMS service.<br><br>
As the network will have to handle this signalling and the corresponding next services for previously MBMS-subscribed UEs on the same preferred frequency they were camping on for the reception of the MBMS service, a network overload may occur on that frequency at the end of the MBMS session.<br>
One possibility for alleviating this problem is to force the UEs to move to other frequencies as soon as an MBMS session ends, so that the signalling load for the next services is spread over several frequencies. This can be done by the use of a single-bit Frequency Dispersion Indicator, which would indicate to UEs that they have to select and move to another frequency before continuing with setting up their next service.<br>
However, when dispersion happens it would apply to all UEs instantly when an MBMS session on a PL stops, and as a result this process of dispersion may create further problems. An overload of network signalling may occur as a result of a large number of UEs simultaneously selecting alternative frequencies and switching to them. Also, unnecessary dispersion could take place for UEs that would next be starting to receive a different MBMS service on the same PL; such UEs would have to go through two successive cell reselection procedures, one to disperse after the first MBMS session, and another to re-converge for the next MBMS session.<br>
An object of the invention is to reduce the risk of signalling overload when a point-to-multipoint service ends.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method of operating a radio station comprising:<br>
terminating a first service on a first radio frequency channel; selecting a second radio frequency channel; and engaging in a second service on the second radio frequency channel; wherein at least one of selecting the second radio frequency channel and engaging in the second service occurs after a time period, relative to the termination of the first service, dependent on at least one of a state of the radio station and a characteristic of the second service.<br><br>
The present invention reduces the risk of overloading and/or increased signalling on all frequencies when a point-to-multipoint service transmission ends, by applying a configurable time delay to the frequency dispersion mechanism based on a prioritisation scheme linked to the current state of the radio station or a characteristic of a following service.<br>
Optionally the state of the radio station is one of: an idle mode in which the radio station does not receive any service, an active mode in which the radio station receives a point-to-point service, an active mode in which the radio station receives a point-to-multipoint service.<br>
Optionally the characteristic of the second service is a priority level of the second service. Optionally the characteristic of the second service is the provision of a point-to-point service or a point-to-mulitpoint service.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described. When a UE engages in a second service following the termination of a first service, the selection by the UE of a radio frequency channel for the second service, or the engagement by the UE in the second service, occurs after a time period relative to the termination of the first service. This time period is dependent on a state of the radio station or on a characteristic of the second service, or on both. As a result the dispersion procedure does not occur instantly for all UEs but takes a certain time depending on the UE's own state transition procedures. This introduces an element of time delay to the frequency dispersion process, resulting in a relative spread over time of the signalling involved in the frequency reselection and/or service transition, and a reduction in network overloading, as well as avoiding unnecessary frequency re-selections. For some state transitions the time period may be zero, resulting in immediate frequency dispersion, whilst for other state transitions the time period may be non-zero.<br>
In one example of state transitions the UE will, after the end of the MBMS service transmission, perform a frequency dispersion procedure if it is transitioning to a point-to-point service (such as receiving a voice call or sending an SMS), and will not perform a frequency dispersion procedure if it suspends all activity and goes into idle mode.  So according to the invention, the time period<br><br>
for performing the state transition after the end of the end of the MBMS service depends on the next state, in this example either idle mode or a point-to-point service.<br>
Another example of state transitions in which different time periods for the dispersion procedure are used is as follows:<br>
a)	If the UE moves to a non-MBMS service, such as a point-to-point service, immediately perform a frequency dispersion procedure<br>
b)	If the UE moves to an idle mode, perform a frequency dispersion procedure after a time delay<br>
c)	If the UE subscribes to another MBMS service (point-to-multipoint):<br>
o   If the MBMS service is on the same PL, do not perform the frequency<br>
dispersion procedure o   If the MBMS service is on the same PL, perform cell re-select for that PL o   If no PL is indicated for the new MBMS service, perform the frequency<br>
dispersion procedure o   If a PL different from the current frequency is indicated for the new MBMS service, perform frequency dispersion direct to the indicated PL. Optionally, the procedures under item c) above may be applied if (and only if) the next MBMS service is scheduled to commence within a predetermined time period after the end of the recently-finished MBMS session.<br>
In a further example, different time delays for frequency dispersion may be realised by setting different time delays in random access procedures. The random access procedures for a UE that is required to back off for a random time period if its first random access attempt fails may be modified in one or more of the following ways when the UE has just finished receiving an MBMS session:<br>
a)	The back-off time after a failed random access attempt by a UE may have different properties (e.g. mean duration or minimum duration) depending on the current state or next action of the UE.<br>
b)	A UE, depending on its current state or next action, may be required to apply a delay before its first random access attempt after an MBMS session terminates.   This delay may be pre-determined or variable, and may be the<br><br>
same  as,  or  different from,  or calculated  from,  the   back-off time  for<br>
subsequent random access repeat attempts, c) The delay before the first random access attempt, and/or the duration of the<br>
back-off time for subsequent random access attempts, may be set according<br>
to the class of service for which the UE is using the random access channel.<br>
Thus a UE wishing to commence a higher-priority service after the end of an<br>
MBMS session may start its frequency dispersion earlier than a UE wishing to<br>
commence a lower-priority service.<br>
The timing of the time periods for the frequency dispersion procedure may be triggered in response to an external stimulus, for example: i)   a received protocol message indicating a start, change or update of a service,<br>
or ii)   receipt of data in a buffer to awaken a UE in idie mode, or iii) receipt of a paging indicator (for a dedicated service or an MBMS service)<br>
which informs the UE of an impending transmission.<br>
Various known frequency dispersion procedures may be triggered by the schemes described above. Examples include:<br>
-	randomly select a new frequency<br>
-	select the strongest signal frequency (including the current frequency)<br>
-	select the strongest signal frequency (excluding the current frequency)<br>
-	select the previous frequency on which the UE was camped before moving to the current frequency<br>
-	some combination of the above.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to UMTS, the invention is not limited to UMTS but can be used in other radio communication systems requiring selection of frequencies for reception of data services.<br>
In the present specification and claims the word "a" or "an" preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. Further, the word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps than those listed. The inclusion of reference signs in parentheses in the claims is intended to aid understanding and is not intended to be limiting.<br><br>
From reading the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. Such modifications may involve other features which are already known in the art of radio communication and which may be used instead of or in addition to features already described herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
