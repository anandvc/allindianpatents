				<td>Method, System and Apparatus for Locating Reverse Link<br>
Interference<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to wireless communication technology, and particularly to a method. system and apparatus for locating reverse link interference at a wireless access system.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Generally, wireless access system employs a plurality of frequency bands. For example. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system employs 13 frequency bands and more than 140 sub-bands distributed from 400 M to 2100 M. Abundance of frequency bands allow the wireless access system to be applied widely, but meanwhile bring some problems. Due to particularity of radio resources, different countries employ different frequency distribution modes. Especially for the widely used 450M band, a variety of complex freq. entry distribution modes are used. Typically application examples in the 450M band include wireless intercom, data radio, analog wireless access, etc. As known to those skilled in the art, complex frequency distribution mode brings serious interferences to the wireless access system, and greatly affects applications of the wireless access system.<br>
For a CDMA system, serious reverse link interference may result in poor system performance and may cause several problems:<br>
1)	Difficult accessing for a user terminal. An existence of reverse link interference lowers reverse sensitivity, and shortens reverse covered distance, thus leads to a difficult accessing for a user terminal.<br>
2)	Unbalance of forward and reverse links, in which case the user terminal displays good signaling but is unable to implement a call.<br>
3)	Higher transmitting power needed by the user terminal, which leads to a higher power consumption and lower system capacity.<br>
4)	Call drop during a call.<br>
Therefore, detection and localization of reverse link interference is an important issue of much concern from the industry for a long time. At present, a commonly used method for detecting and locating reverse link interference is determining reverse link interference conditions of a current sector according to a Received Signal Strength indicator (RSSI) value recorded by the wireless access system. If the RSSI value is at a high level, the system may encounter serious reverse link interference; otherwise,   the   reverse   link   interference   in   the<br><br>
When the RSSI value recorded by the wireless access system is used to determine whether the system encounters serious reverse link interference, a special interference detector such as a spectrum analyzer is needed to collect wireless signals around the system, analyze the wireless signals collected and locate an interfering source. This kind of method for detecting and locating reverse link interference needs person participation and has several shortcomings:<br>
A.	A long time should be spent in continuously collecting the wireless signals if the wireless<br>
circumstance is complex. In this case, it is difficult for a person to complete this task especially<br>
in an atrocious area such as an alpine station or a desert.<br>
B.	If the location of the spectrum analyzer is not consistent with the location of system<br>
antenna, especially in a hilly or mountainous area, collecting wireless signals by using the<br>
interference detector manually may lead to a detection error, thereby increasing locating<br>
difficulty.<br>
As described above, the method for detecting and locating reverse link interference described above is difficult to be implemented, is easily affected by the circumstance and human factors, and has poor accuracy in reverse link interference detection and localization.<br>
