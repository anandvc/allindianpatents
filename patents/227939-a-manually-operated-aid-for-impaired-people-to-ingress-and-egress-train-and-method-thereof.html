				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an aid to ingress and egress to train compartment, more particularly invention relates to a manually operated aid for impaired people to ingress and egress in a passenger train compartment that employs foldable steps, fixed below the door of the compartment. The instant invention helps aged persons and children who can not reach the door step of railway compartment with ease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The existing trends of staircases fail to address limitations of elderly people in entering into the train compartment. The current compartment of trains doesn"t overcome the limitations of elderly people in terms of access and strength.<br>
Many elderly people fall in the category of impaired people. People suffering from arthritis, spinal chord injury and dementia are some of the causes of bringing in disability in the elderly people. Arthritis, spinal chord injury, muscular atrophy reduces the range of motion of legs in elderly people due to which they cannot make steps that are more than 6 inches in height.<br>
The instant invention solves the problem of elderly, impaired people and children. The major problems faced while accessing the train compartment are:<br>
a.	The steps to get into the train compartment vertically, so people find it difficult to<br>
get through the steps without the side support.<br>
b.	The horizontal gap between the train compartment and the surface of the railway<br>
platform varies from 3 inches to 11 inches in different stations<br>
c.	The vertical gap between the train compartment floor and the railway platform exists<br>
in three different heights 1 ft 6 inches; 2ft 6 inches and 1 inch at different stations.<br>
Elderly people find difficulty in accessing vertical gaps of 1 ft 6 inches and 2 ft 6<br>
inches and require human assistance to get into the train compartment.<br>
Common device for mobility are cranes and walkers, which come in various shapes and styles.<br><br>
In the present scenario there are no products in India for assisting the impaired people at railway stations. Foldable ramps cover the horizontal gap between the train floor and the platform floor. Ramps serve the purpose when there is very less vertical gap not more than 3 inches between the platform surface and the train floor. These ramps are generally used to move people sitting on wheel chair.<br>
Apart from ramps, wheel chair lifts are also available for lifting a wheel-chair to the level of the train floor so as to make the wheel-chair to enter into the train. It is basically electrically driven which is placed on platforms to assist the movement of severely impaired people.<br>
The foldable ramps are electrically powered. The instant invention provides for bridging the horizontal as well as the vertical gap between the train floor and the platform which is operated manually. In Indian scenario, where platform heights and gap varies from one station to other station, instant invention overcomes the problem of platform height and provides the solution.<br>
People who fall in this impaired category are as follows: Permanent impaired:<br>
1.	Aged people<br>
2.	People suffering from diseases like arthritis, spinal chord injury, muscular atrophy etc.<br>
3.	People without one or more than one limbs (lower or upper)<br>
Temporarily impaired:<br>
1.	People suffering from back pain or leg pain<br>
2.	People in the rejuvenating stage after surgery, heart attack or high fever<br><br>
4.	People having plaster in one of his limbs due to bone facture etc.<br>
5.	Pregnant women.<br>
6.	Children between the age group of 6 to 12<br><br>
In existing trends for example US 3,408,959, wherein the document has folding staircase for a passenger vehicles. A folding staircase for a passenger vehicle that converts from a platform in the vestibule of the vehicle to a pair of steps extending outwardly from the door of the vestibule and down to a station platform. The convertible staircase pivots 180Â° around the vehicle"s doorsill by means of an arm and linked mechanism to fold from the exterior stair position into the interior platform position.<br>
Another existing step arrangement for example US 3,572,754, bus-type vehicle ingress and egress of passengers is carried out through a door opening the upper portion of which is closed by a swingably mounted door and the lower portion of which is closed by a step and platform arrangement selectively movable between a raised position wherein a portion of the step and platform structure is movable to either close the door opening or open the opening and provide a high level platform for passenger ingress and egress at vehicle floor level, and a lowered position wherein it provides a plurality of steps between ground level and vehicle floor level.<br>
The citations do not provide for slider mechanism and parallel bar mechanism with sets of parallel rods which is simple in construction. The citations include gear and chain mechanisms which are driven by electric motor and are controlled by micro switches. These gear arrangements with the chain links to transmit the power will make the step arrangement complex. The instant invention is deployed on platforms independent of their height.<br>
The instant invention doesn"t require sophisticated remote control system and hence reduces total manufacturing cost. The citations doesn"t provide for capacity of the step system, whereas the instant invention clearly indicates that the steps (1) sufficiently bears load of up to about 700 N. The citations doesn"t provides for the operation of the device manually as it is remote controlled and automatic in nature. The instant invention successfully overcomes the problems faced by the impaired people while climbing the train compartment. The impaired people find difficulty in making large steps while climbing the steps. The impaired people are able to climb the stairs safely with shorter steps, with less effort and easily. Even though the citations provides for the high end<br><br>
model of the steps wherein the system is automated, the system still has not overcome the problem faced by the impaired people. The instant invention clearly states that impaired people are more comfortable in using the steps defined in instant invention, wherein the horizontal and vertical gap is less than 6 inches. In the instant invention, the horizontal and vertical gap in between the steps is less than 6 inches and is sufficient enough to climb the steps by impaired, elderly people and children to ingress and egress the Train Compartment.<br>
The citations make use of Gear and Chain arrangements which drives the staircase to open and close. However, the instant invention doesn"t make use of such gear and chain arrangements instead, it uses the simple slider mechanism to obtain the objective of complete deployment of the steps.<br>
The instant invention clearly states that the steps (1) always remain horizontal with respect to the platform of the station, whereas in case of the citations, it is evident that the staircases are extended outwardly and are pivoted. The arms (42) pivoted needs to rotate clockwise in order to open completely. But, the instant invention makes use of simple parallel bar mechanism which is not of rotatable type whereas, any person with less effort can easily deploy it for use and it is user friendly, and ease in operation.<br>
The citation US 3, 572, 754 provides for vehicle step arrangement wherein the step arrangement is placed at the door and it is operated hydraulically. The citation clearly fails to overcome the problem in situations of varying height of the platforms, whereas the instant invention clearly solves the problem of step arrangements for varying platforms heights. The citations doesn"t talk about steps arrangement which are used by impaired people, whereas the instant invention"s principal object is to construct the step arrangement which is deployed very easily and is used by impaired people independent of platform heights.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the invention is to develop a manually operated aid for impaired people to ingress and egress train compartment from railway platform with ease.<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop a foldable step system and to keep the system inside a box which is fixed under the door of the train compartment, whenever not in use. The foldable step system is pulled out and pushed downwards for deployment and folded back again by manual operation.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method of manual operation of an aid for ingress and egress to train compartment from railway platform.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in relation to a manually operated aid for impaired people to ingress and egress train compartment from railway platform independent of platform height comprises plurality of steps (1) joined to sets of parallel rods (2) at side ends through rotational joints (3), and guide (la) joining the sets of parallel rods (2) with guide (lb) of box (A) fixed under door of the train.<br>
In yet embodiment of the present invention the rods (2) are hollow in nature and have holes perpendicular to its axis at predetermined locations for joining with the steps (1) through the rotational joints (3).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the rods (2) and the box (A) are made of steel and mild steel respectively.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the system is capable of withstanding load up to about 700 N.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the rod ends are covered by nylon clad (7) which touch the railway platform.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the steps (1) are plates preferably made of Aluminium.<br>
The present invention is in relation to a method of manual operation of an aid for ingress and egress train compartment from railway platform comprises acts of pulling folded system (B) from box (A) fixed under door of the train till the system (B) extends completely, pushing the extended system (B) downwards for its complete deployment and thereby touching the railway platform, and locking guide (la) with guide (lb) of the box (A) to prevent the system (B) from sliding on railway platform and thereby making the system (B) stable for ingress and egress to the train compartment.<br>
The instant invention is inspired from parallel bar mechanism, wherein all the steps remain horizontal with the platform at different angles of the vertical bar rotation. The<br><br>
system essentially consists of steps, folded and kept inside a box. The steps are attached with a set of parallel rods (Fig 1, Fig.2, and Fig.3) that moves with respect to each other, enabling the steps to expand or retract. Set of parallel guides are provided inside the box, on which the entire system consisting of the set of steps and the sets of parallel rods is guided fro movement (to expand or to retract). The aid is fixed under the passenger door compartment in the space as shown in the figure 39. Figure 4 shows the details of the system. Figure 5 illustrates computer generated model showing the internal structures of the instant invention. Figure 6 illustrates the front portion of the prototype developed by instant invention. The entire proposed system is folded inside the metal cover, which is fitted under the door of the existing passenger railway compartment door. Figure 7 shows the system wherein the system is fitted under the compartment"s door without any modification on the door entrance or on the door.<br>
The step system needs to be pulled manually out of the box (A) and has to push back to its initial state before the train leaves the railway platform. The instant invention eliminates the necessity for specialized personnel to help a disabled person and this providing the disabled person more comfort. The device as designed and developed is opened and closes by any public, with less effort.<br>
Maximum vertical distance between the train floor and the railway platform is 26 inches; while the maximum horizontal distance between the train surface and the platform vertical surface is 11 inches and the vertical gap between which the product assembly fits is 10 inches; steps dimensions are fixed considering the above conditions.<br>
Ergonomic step height for a normal person is 6 inches and maximum depth of step is 10 inches. Considering the dimensional conditions and ergonomic views finalized on the step height to be 5.2 inches and 7 inches as step overhang between adjacent steps. The horizontal gap between the two vertical rods is 7 inches.<br>
Number of steps = 26/5.2=5 steps<br>
It is required to put 4 steps as the train floor serves the purpose of last step.<br><br>
When the vertical gap between the train floor and the platform is 18 inches then the step height reduces to (18/5) 3.6 inches.<br>
The whole assembly is fixed through a space of 30 inches width; hence there was a condition imposed on deciding the maximum width of the step. The finalized width of the step ranges from 610 mm to 785 mm.<br>
The mechanical assembly is pulled out manually hence rollers (bearings) are provided to reduce the effort of pulling. A person gets support while climbing the steps are provided to the entrance of the compartment as shown in Figures 13-18. Hence there is no need to provide another side support rail. The side rails provided at the entrance of the compartment are within the reach of the person when the horizontal gap between the train surface and the platform vertical surface is 5 inches and when the gap is 11 inches the side rails are reachable from first step.<br>
The following materials has been selected for different components of the aid system steel for rods, aluminum for step plates , mild steel for box guide (la) and guide (lb), nylon clad. Engineering design calculations has been carried out to ascertain the required dimensions of all parts of the system, taking a 700 N load which is weight of an 50"^ percentile male.<br>
Vertical rods are painted in yellow which increases visibility in the dark and the side support bars at the train entrance are also painted in yellow. Yellow colour of the rods (hollow pipes) makes the product harmonious with the train colour pattern.<br>
Total cost of fabrication of the prototype = material cost + fabrication cost =5200 + 4000. Total cost of fabrication = Rs.9200.<br>
Weight of the aid system optimized (without the cover): 15.16 kg. Effort required using the system is 75 N (pulling in horizontal direction).<br>
A prototype of this embodiment has been successfully fabricated and tested in a passenger railway compartment with public volunteers.<br><br>
Operation:<br>
The following steps describes the system<br>
Step 1: When the train arrives at the station, the systems is in the folded state (Fig. 8)<br>
Step 2: The system is then manually pulled out by any person (Fig.9)<br>
Step 3: After pulling the staircase out the staircase needs to be pushed down in, order to<br>
open it completely (Fig.9) The system is then touching the station (Fig. 10)<br>
Step 4: The step system is then pushed a little inside as required in order to lock itself so<br>
that it becomes stable and can take the full designed load (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12)<br>
The system gets for use. The system is folded back before the train starts from the station, following similar procedure. The procedure of how a person can use for ingress and egress the train by using the product has been described using a set of figures (figures ISIS, figures 19-24, figures 25-30 and figures 31-36). Figure 37 illustrates testing of the setup to simulate variations in vertical height difference between the passenger railway coach and railway platforms. Figure 38 illustrates the front view of testing setup to simulate variations in vertical height difference between the passenger railway coach and railway platforms. Figure 39 illustrates the box (A) is required to be fitted under the door of a compartment. Figure 40 illustrates the aid system tested by a public volunteer by ingressing in to the compartment.<br>
The characteristic feature of instant invention is that disabled people are easily able to enter and exit the train compartment. Prototype has been fabricated and successfully tested.<br><br><br><br>
