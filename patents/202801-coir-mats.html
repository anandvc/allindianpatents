Various types of door mats are employed at entry ways to reduce the dirt and water typically found on shoe soles entering the door. Such mats inchide a provision of brushing and wiping action against shoe sole and storing of collected dirt and water. Some of mats may have good wiping capacity, some otheis may have good stoiage capacity and few otheis may haN7e xapid water evaporation capacity and few more may satisfactorily hide the collected dirt from view, few may provide luxuriant underfoot surface and others may be<br>
attractive, some have bottom layer and some are without bottom layers. A single mat of all above features above mentioned is not known. There is one or the other shortcoming in the mats known currently. It is desired to achieve a mat, which has all the features herein above mentioned, and also capable of being woven in an conventianal equipment without any mechanical modification to the conventional equipment.<br>
OBJECT OF THB INVERTION :-<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a luxuriant underfoot surface, attractive to look, which have good scraping effect, have sufficient capacity for storage of dirt and from which water will be evaporated quickly.<br><br>
The another object of the invention is to have a mat which acts as a good dirt scraper and also to provide openers to store the removed dirt, which alongwith provides a luxuriant^ attractive and durable surface capable of wiping shoe soles, receiving, obscuring and holding therein dirt removed from shoe soles, wipic^ water from the shoe soles and facilitating evaporation of water.<br>
The another object of the invention is to have a mat with alternate material to coir for a mat, or an alternate material useable with coir for a mat with above essential features.<br>
The another object of the invention is to have a mat with alternate material which is a natural fiber like jute or grass.<br>
The another object of the invention is to have a mat with alternate material which is a natural fiber and also which is easily available in abundance and is cost effective.<br>
The another object of the invention is to have a mat with alternate material, which will essentialty have aH the characteristics desked in a material suitable for weaving a mat and which characteristics are found and well utiliased in coir mats of known art.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to weave a mat with coir and grass yams, wherein coir fibers provide a sufficiently open mat to store dirt between fibers, the open end grass fibers are very eSecttve in scraping, absorbing and storing the dirt alongwith good water absorbing and evaporating water quickly after absorption. The pile portion of the mat prevents the retracking, by having sufficient dirt storage space within, so as to leave veiy little dirt on the top of the mat and will not cause the next person walking to pickup the dirt and to move further along on the joiat.<br>
It is another object of the invention wherein the preferred mat of the invention includes piles of cut grass and tufts of looped coir. VJhile the coir loop may be cut, it is preferred that there be uncut, thereby making the mat more effective in storing.<br>
SUMBIARY OF THE HTVENTIOBT:-<br>
A mat having pluxality of looped coir yarns and phixality of piled g^ass yarns woven in a conventional loom. The coir yarn is wound to the ti^t chain beam to foim the tig)at chain of the mat. The second set of coix yarn and grass yarn is combinedly wound to warp beam to form the warp yarn arrangement. The predefined combination is equal member of strands of grass yarn and coir yam alternating. The mat is woven. Thereafter the grass portion in warp bunch is cut to form the pile and coir portion is left uncut to form the loop.<br><br>
The mat i^ finally fiimhed by shearing after being taken ofE from loom. The preferred pattern of grass pile and coir loops is alternate stripes consisting essentially of grass or coir in an area,<br>
DESCRIPTIPy OF mVETXTlOTX &gt;<br>
The mat of the present invention may be produced by conventional equipments. Yarn is a bundle of crimped fibers of the appropriate size. The coir yams are crimped to give the area containing these coir yarns with sufl&amp;cient openness to receive and hide dirt and debris.<br>
A mat having plurality of looped coir yams and plurality of piled grass yarns woven in a conventional loom. The coir yarn is wound to the tight chain beam to form the tight chain of the mat. The second set of coir yam and grass yarn is combinediy wound to warp beam to form the warp yam arrangement. The predefined combination is equal member of strands of grass yarn and coir yarn alternating. The mat is woven. Thereafter the grass portion in warp bunch is cut to form the pile and coii portion is left uncut to form the loop. The mat is finally finished by shearing after being taken off from loom. The preferred pattern of grass pile and coir loops is alternate stripes consisting essentially of grass or coir in an area.<br><br>
The relative proportion of tufts of crimped, coir yarns lo piled tufts of grass yams are adjusted to provide sufficient wiping action and water absorbency, thought to be a function mainly of the grass yams and sufficient openness to collect and obscure collected dirt, the latter being a function mainly of the tufts of coir yam. Most preferable, the areas of grass are in areas separate from areas of the tufts of coir, to form a pattern of alternate stripes of each area.<br>
The method of making the g^tass and coir mat is described herein.<br>
The coir yam and grass yarn in the required quantity is taken. The weaving is done on a conventional mat weaving loom. The first set of yarn essentially coir yam is wound to the tight chain beam. The open end of the strand is drawn to the loom through the wire healds and the reeds and then tied on the iron rod. This becomes the tight chain of the mat. In the tight chain there will be 9 strands in 10cm in a preferred embodiment.<br>
The second set of yarn and comprising of combination of coir yarn and grass yarn is wound to the warp beam at equal specified intervals and is then dra!wi3L through the wiie-healds and reeds and tied to the same iron rod. The warp yarn arrangement has a plurality of combination yarn arrangement wherein the warp yam arrangement general^ has equal member of strands of<br><br>
grass yams followed by a similar number of coir yams in the preferred embodiment.<br>
Thereafter aftjer the yarn arrangBment is decided the mat is woven. The woven mat will ha\7e grass portion and coir portion alternate on the warp. The gjcass portion in the warp bunch is cut from the above woven mat with a knife to form a pile. The coir portion is left untouched to be retained as loop. The mat thus made is cut and removed from the loom. The top portion of the mat is then sheared usic^ scissors for even surface.<br>
The combination of grass and coir in this type of formation and weaving is novel and is not known in the prior ait.<br>
The preferred embc^diment wherein the coir and grass yam altematmg is illustrated in the drawings annexed hereto.<br>
Fig 1: gives the top view illustrating the surface area of tufts of coir yarn (A) and piles of grass yarn (B) alternating along the length. The length of each unit (C} is predetermined in relation to the size of a human feet (D).<br>
Fig. 2: shows the side view of the mat wherein the tufts would be alternating with the piles so that the cleaning and the collecting process is achieved.<br><br>
Each of the areas is preferably at least about 40 mm to 60 mm in smallest dimension, that being the approximate width of one row of tufts of a typical crimped looped coir, to provide an adequate space for storage of dirt, but not more than 60 mm in its smallest dimension so that the shoe sole of a pedestrian will always contact both areas with each step.<br>
In the preferred pattern of stripes, the areas of coir and areas of grass may be of same height, or the areas of coir may be slightly shorter than the height of cut grass. The cut ends of the grass provide a wiping action agamst the shoe sole which removes dirt therefrom and the crimped looped coir creates a very open structure which is capable of easily receiving and obscuring dirt once the dirt enters therein.<br>
The preferred mat of the invention includes tufts of looped, crimped g;rass and tufts of looped crimped coir woven alternatively and parallel^. The grass portion is cut to enhance the wiping action. It is however preferred that coir portion be always left uncut to retain the storage e£5ciently of the mat.<br>
The pile height is between 25 mm to 28 mm. If the pile height is too high, the fibers tend to hiyover on th&amp;nselves and could interfere with the dirt storage capacity. A pile height which is too hi^ may also provide a trippiog hazard. If the pile height is too low the dirt hiding capacity is diminished.<br><br>
The aim of the invention is to achieve a mat which has good fictional surface, good wiping, action of dirt and water storing of removed dirt and water^ to lower retraddng eSect alongmth rapid evaporation of water absorbed alongwLth dirt. The other features desired in the mat are providing a hixiiriarxt, attractive and durable surface capable of wiping, receiving, obscuring and holding therein the dirt removed from shoe soles, wiping water from shoe soles and fSsLciHtating rapid evaporation of water. Moreover it is possible to use a conventional machine to make this mat, without making any alteration to the existing machine.   The equipment and the process of loom are well known in<br>
the art.<br>
The mat of the present inveatton may also include a bottom bacldag, which provides wei§^t or body to the mat, to prevent it from beiag displaced as it is being walked over. The bottom backing material may be formed torn conventional materials known for this purpose. The bottom backing also retains and holds the dust and water collected in the mat to be retained and not to he dropped off an floor until picked up for cleaning and shaking.<br>
Generally bottom backing is rubber latex and similar matters well known in the field.<br><br><br><br>
