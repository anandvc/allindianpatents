Description<br>
1,4-Benzothiazepine-1,1 -dioxide derivatives substituted by sugar residues, process for their preparation, pharmaceuticals comprising these compounds, and their use<br>
The invention relates to substituted 1,4-benzothiazepine-1,1-dioxide derivatives, their physiologically tolerable salts and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
1,4-Benzothiazepine-1,1-dioxide derivates and their use for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and also arteriosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have already been described [cf. PCT Application No. PCT/GB 95/01884, Publication No. WO 96/05188].<br>
The invention is based on the object of making available further compounds which display a therapeutically valuable hypolipidemic action. In particular, the object consists in finding novel compounds which cause a higher excretion of bile acid, even at a lower dosage, compared with the compounds described in the prior art.<br><br><br><br><br>
R	is ethyl, butyl;<br>
R2	is H, OH;<br>
_3<br>
R	is a sugar residue, the sugar residue optionally being mono-<br>
or polysubstituted by a sugar protective group;<br>
Z	is -(C=0)-Crj-C4-alkyl, a covalent bond;<br>
and their pharmaceutically tolerable salts.<br>
On account of their higher water solubility compared with the starting or base compounds, pharmaceutically tolerable salts are particularly suitable for medicinal applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically tolerable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically tolerable acid addition salts of the compounds according to the invention are salts of inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, meta-phosphoric, nitric, sulfonic and sulfuric acids and also organic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethane-sulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic, tartaric and trifluoro-acetic acids. For medicinal purposes, the chlorine salt is particularly preferably used. Suitable pharmaceutically tolerable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
Salts with a nonpharmaceutically tolerable anion are likewise included in the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically tolerable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in-vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used here designates any physiologically tolerable derivative of a compound according to the invention, e.g. an ester which on administration to a mammal, such as, for example, man, is able (directly or indirectly) to form such a compound or an active metabolite thereof.<br><br>
A further aspect of this invention is prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs can themselves be active or inactive.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be present in various polymorphic forms, e.g. as amorphous and crystalline polymorphic forms. All polymorphic forms of the compounds according to the invention are included in the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Below, all references to "compound(s) according to formula (I)" relate to compound(s) of the formula (I) as described above, and to their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
The amount of a compound according to formula (I) which is necessary in order to achieve the desired biological effect is dependent on a number of factors, e.g. the chosen specific compound, the intended use, the manner of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. In general, the daily dose lies in the range from 0.1 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.1 mg and 50 mg) per day per kilogram of body weight, e.g. 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. Tablets or capsules can contain, for example, from 0.01 to 100 mg, typically from 0.02 to 50 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically tolerable salts, the abovementioned weight data relate to the weight of the benzothiazepine ion derived from the salt. For the prophylaxis or therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds according to formula (I) can be used themselves as the compound, but they are preferably present with a tolerable carrier in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. The carrier must of course be tolerable, in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and is not harmful to the health of the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as an individual dose, for example as a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Further pharmaceutically active substances can likewise be present, including further compounds according to formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist in mixing the constituents with pharmacologically tolerable carriers and/or excipients.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral and peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration, even if the most suitable manner of administration in each individual case is dependent on the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and on the type of the compound according to formula (I) used in each case. Sugar-coated formulations and sugar-coated sustained release formulations are also included in the scope of the invention. Acid-resistant and enteric formulations are preferred. Suitable enteric coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinal acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can be present in separate units, such as, for example, capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets, which in each case contain a certain amount of the compound according to formula (I); as powders or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions can be prepared, as already mentioned, according to any suitable pharmaceutical method which comprises a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which can consist of one or more additional constituents) are brought into contact. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product, if necessary, is shaped. Thus, for example, a tablet can be prepared by compressing or shaping a powder or granules of the compound, if appropriate with one or more additional constituents. Pressed tablets can be prepared by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, if appropriate mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or a (a number) of surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be prepared by shaping the pulverulent compound, moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges, which contain a compound according to the formula (I) with a flavoring, customarily sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br><br>
The invention furthermore relates both to isomeric mixtures of the formula I and to the pure stereoisomers of the formula I, and also to diastereomer mixtures of the formula I and the pure diastereomers. The separation of the mixtures is carried out chromatographically.<br>
Racemic and enantiomerically pure compounds of the formula I having the following structure are preferred:<br><br>
Sugar residues are understood as meaning compounds which are derived from aldoses and ketoses having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, which can belong to the D or L series; these also include amino sugars, sugar alcohols or sugar acids. Examples which may be mentioned are glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, ribose, erythrose, glyceraldehyde, sedoheptulose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, galactonic acid, mannonic acid, glucamine, 3-amino-1,2-propanediol, glucaric acid and galactaric acid.<br>
Disugars are intended to mean saccharides which consist of two sugar units. Di-, tri- or tetrasaccharides are formed by acetal-like bonding of 2 or more sugars. The bonds can occur here in the a or p form. Examples which may be mentioned are lactose, maltose and cellobiose.<br>
If the sugar is substituted, the substitution preferably takes place on the hydrogen atom of an OH group of the sugar.<br>
The following protective groups are essentially suitable for the hydroxyl groups of the sugars: benzyl, acetyl, benzoyl, pivaloyl, trityl, tert-butyl-<br><br>
dimethylsilyl, benzylidene, cyclohexylidene or isopropylidene protective groups.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical^ tolerable salts and physiologically functional derivatives are ideal pharmaceuticals for the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders, in particular of hyperlipidemia. The compounds of the formula I are likewise suitable for influencing the serum cholesterol level and for preventing and treating arteriosclerotic symptoms. The compounds can optionally also be administered in combination with statins, such as, for example, simvastatatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin or atorvastin. The following findings confirm the pharmacological activity of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The biological testing of the compounds according to the invention was carried out by means of the perfusion test. This test investigates the action of the compounds according to the invention on the bile acid transport in the ileum. The diastereomer mixtures of the compounds were tested.<br>
The perfusion test was carried out as follows:<br>
Experimental set-up<br>
Male Wistar rats (weight range 250-350 g) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg i.p.) and the bile duct was cannulated with a polyethylene tube. Eight cm proximally to the ileocecal flap, an incision was made into the ileum and a silicone adapter for tubes was sewn in. A second incision with implantation of a corresponding silicone adapter was made in the cecum. Silicone tubes were attached to the adapter in order to perfuse the ileum in an orthograde and open manner (nonrecirculating) with perfusion buffer at a perfusion rate of 1 ml/min.<br>
The perfusion tubes were filled with perfusion buffer (137 mM NaCI,<br>
0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.51 mM MgCl2, 8.1 mM Na2HPC&gt;4, 2.7 mM KCI, 1.47 mM<br>
KH2PO4) (pH 7.4),   1% (v/v) ethanol + 1% DMSO. The perfusion buffer<br>
contained the test compounds in concentrations as indicated or the vehicle.<br>
The buffer was preheated to 37 C. The perfusion buffer contained 3 mM<br>
3<br>
taurocholic acid (TCA), which in turn was labeled with 1000 dpm//vl of H TCA as a marker.<br><br>
Study design and evaluation of the results<br>
An experimental batch was chosen which allowed the determination of the inhibition of bile acid transport in the individual animal. The bile was collected at 10 min intervals over a period of 90 min (in the case of a following wash-out phase for testing the reversibility over a period of up to 160 min. The perfusion of the vehicle-containing buffer solution over a period of 40 min (pre-test substance) was followed by a perfusion with perfusion buffer which contained the test compound in the concentration to be tested (to 90 min).<br>
For the calculation of the percentage inhibition by the test compound, the<br>
3<br>
dpms (disintegrations per min of H-TCA) in the bile from 80-90 min (end of the perfusion with the test substance) were related to the collection period 30-40 min during the preliminary phase, when the excretion of the H-TCA in the control phase had reached its maximum and plateau. The EC50 (= effective concentration 50) was calculated as the effective concentration between the inhibitory values of different concentration which inhibited the maximum bile acid excretion by 50%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
