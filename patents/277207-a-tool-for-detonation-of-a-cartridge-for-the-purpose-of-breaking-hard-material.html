HANDHELD PNEUMATIC TOOL FOR BREAKING UP ROCK<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No.<br>
60/594,037 entitled "HANDHELD PNEUMATIC TOOL FOR BREAKING UP<br>
ROCK" filed on 7 March 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Numerous devices have been utilized in the art of breaking up rock. Most<br>
such devices are quite large, and are used in mining, quarries and excavation endeavors.<br>
These devices and methods are typically for large-scale efforts resulting in massive<br>
explosions, and the destruction or generation of large areas of broken rock. Few<br>
devices exist for specialized small scale breaking efforts; however, these devices tend<br>
to be larger than the present device, utilize far more explosive force and dollar.<br>
[0003] For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,789,694 ('694) shows a tool and method for<br>
breaking up rock. The tool of '694 has a barrel, a breech body for receiving a gas<br>
discharge cartridge loaded with gas producing propellant and a firing-handle<br>
mechanism (a firing pin) for firing the cartridge. The method involves drilling a hole in<br>
rock, filling the hole with water, passing the barrel down the hole, and firing the<br>
cartridge. The cartridge used is similar to a shotgun cartridge and has a rim-fire<br>
percussion cap, which complements the firing pin. In operation, the barrel is inserted<br>
into a water-filled hole while the cartridge, which is engaged at the top of the barrel<br>
opposite the bottom of the hole, is detonated by the firing pin thereby producing rapid<br>
gas expansion into the water generating shock waves throughout the water and<br>
fracturing of the rock. The device additionally uses a blast shield.<br>
[0004] The explosive gas cartridge of the '694 invention is placed in the middle of<br>
the device at the top of the barrel. The barrel of the '694 patent is used as a pipe for<br>
channeling the force of the detonated gas chamber into the bottom of the borehole. The<br>
device of '694 requires a blast shield indicating the great force released thereby. A<br>
smaller device, which has a smaller explosion, is desired so that the device may be used<br>
in circumstances not conducive to most explosions.<br>
[0005] Many related art devices involve methods that require drilling boreholes and<br>
generating a rapid increase in the concentration of pressure in the bottom of a borehole<br>
either by explosions, or a sudden increase in fluid pressure, to facilitate and propagate<br>
fracturing of the rock. Many of these inventions are designed to excavate rocks or dig<br>
1<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
tunnels, and include various boom-supported devices. All of these devices use impact<br>
and expansive gas in order to break apart rock or other hard material. These devices<br>
are quite large and produce substantial explosions/gas expansions, and are otherwise<br>
unsuitable for the purposes of the present invention. The majority of the related art<br>
uses large-scale devices, which are disposed on boom arms.<br>
[0006] Methods of breaking up rock which couple explosive (or rapid gas<br>
expansion) and mechanical impact breaking to excavate rock and dig tunnels are well<br>
known. U.S. Patent No. 5,803,550 (550) discloses a method for breaking rock using<br>
small-charge blasting techniques followed by a mechanical impact breaker. In the<br>
small-charge blasting technique, a gas is released into the bottom of a sealed hole. The<br>
gas pressure rises rapidly in the hole until the gas pressure causes the hard material to<br>
fracture followed by an impact breaker to complete the fracturing of the rock and to<br>
remove the fractured material. The '550 device involves a large mobile undercarrier<br>
having a boom assembly with a mechanical impact breaker and a small charge blasting<br>
apparatus attached thereto. It is desirable to have a very small charge blasting<br>
technique that is effective without using an impact breaker to increase the fracture of<br>
the rock generated by the detonation of the load. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 5,308,149<br>
('149) uses a controlled-fracturing process accompanied by pressurizing the bottom of<br>
a drill hole in such a way as to initiate and propagate a controlled fracture. The process<br>
of' 149 uses a large apparatus to operate.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,145,933 ('933) describes a method for removing hard rock<br>
by a combination of impact hammers and small charge blasting. The method of '933<br>
uses small-charged blasting techniques followed by a mechanical impact breaker. In<br>
the small-charge blasting technique of the '933 patent, a gas is released into the bottom<br>
of a sealed hole located at a free surface of the rock. The gas pressure rises rapidly in<br>
the hole until the gas pressure causes the rock to fracture. A blasting agent may be used<br>
to cause initial subsurface fractures. An impact breaker is then used to complete<br>
fracturing and removal of the material. The devices utilized in the invention of '933 are<br>
large scale and are held into position by boom arms.<br>
[0008] It is known in the art to seal or block the bore hole to increase the pressure<br>
at the bottom of the hole without using additional impact apparatuses. U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,148,730 describes a method and apparatus for controlled small-charge blasting by<br>
pressurization of the bottom of a drill hole. The invention therein involves drilling a<br>
hole in rock, inserting a cartridge containing an explosive apparatus, bracing the<br>
2<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
cartridge with a massive stemming bar in the drilled hole, and detonating the explosive<br>
thereby generating fractures in the rock. Likewise, U.S. Patent No. 6,035,784 discloses<br>
a method and apparatus for controlled small-charge blasting of hard rock explosive<br>
pressurization of the bottom of a drill hole which uses a cartridge containing an<br>
explosive charge inserted into the bottom of a drilled hole wherein the cartridge is held<br>
in place by a massive stemming bar. The stemming bar also serves to partially block<br>
the hole increasing the pressure of the explosion.<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent No. 5,765,923 teaches a cartridge for generating high-pressure<br>
gases in a drilled hole. The cartridge includes a base member, a body member, a<br>
propellant, and a device for sealing a surface of the cartridge to the surface of a hole in<br>
the material. Upon ignition of the propellant, gas pressure rapidly rises in the hole due<br>
to the sealing device. The gas pressure causes the material to form a penetrating cone<br>
fracture. The cartridge is placed in a hole by a boom suspended from large-scale<br>
equipment. In operation, the cartridge is first loaded into a combustion chamber and a<br>
gas injector barrel is placed into the drill hole. A firing pin is actuated thereby<br>
triggering the primer which in turn ignites the propellant. As the propellant burns,<br>
pressure is built up within the cartridge. At a desired psi (pounds per square inch), the<br>
cartridge body ruptures releasing the generated gas into the combustion chamber and<br>
the barrel.<br>
[0010] Many related art devices and methods involve apparatuses that insert<br>
explosives into a hole using a boom, which explosives may then be detonated remotely.<br>
Additionally, the boom arm may serve to partially seal the hole. U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,721,471 shows a drill-and-blast module which is disposed on the end of a boom for<br>
insertion in a hole and detonation thereof. U.S. Patent No. 5,098,163 ('163) discloses a<br>
controlled fracture method for breaking hard compact rock which involves a boom<br>
supported apparatus that inserts an explosive, or a propellant charge, in a pre-drilled<br>
hole. The '163 apparatus may utilize a barrel to insert the explosives, and the hole may<br>
be sealed behind the explosive in an effort to control the explosion.<br>
[0011] Furthermore, it is well known to use devices and methods, which increase<br>
fluid pressure by means other than explosive or rapid gas expansion, to break apart the<br>
rock. U.S. Patent No. 4,669,783 teaches a process and apparatus for fragmenting rock<br>
using an explosion-free pulse of water directed into a borehole resulting in high-<br>
pressure shock waves that fractures the rock. U.S. Patent No. 6,375,271 describes a<br>
controlled foam injection system for fragmentation of hard compact rock whereby a<br>
3<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
high pressure foam is inserted into a drill hole by a barrel, which seals the hole and is<br>
disposed at the end of a boom attached to heavy equipment.<br>
[0012] Alternative detonation techniques and hybrid methodologies are also<br>
known. U.S. Patent No. 2,058,099 describes a blasting cartridge that is inserted into a<br>
drill hole. High water pressure is exerted on the cartridge through a pipe resulting in a<br>
sudden explosive release of pressure increasing substance from the cartridge. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,803,551 ('551) discloses a method, apparatus and cartridge, which are<br>
disposed on a boom truck, for non-explosive rock fragmentation. The '551 method<br>
involves first drilling a hole into a rock, positioning a charging system having a<br>
propellant cartridge inserted therein, which cartridge has a propellant and means for<br>
igniting the propellant, and forcing the propellant cartridge through the charging system<br>
and into the hole to ignite the propellant.<br>
[0013] U.S. Patent No. 6,318,272 teaches a method of breaking rock, which<br>
includes drilling a hole in the rock by a drilling machine having an articulated boom<br>
and a drilling tool at the end of the boom. After removing the drilling tool, a rock<br>
breaking charge is charged into the hole, which charge includes a propellant, a fuse<br>
head, and a tamping medium contained in a casing. The tamping medium is discharged<br>
into the hole and allowed to set around and rearward of the propellant. The driving<br>
mechanism is removed and the propellant is actuated from a remote position via<br>
electrical charge or the like.<br>
[0014] U.S. Patent No. 4,508,035 involves an explosive charging apparatus for rock<br>
drilling which charges a controlled amount of explosives sequentially to bores drilled in<br>
a rock surface and includes an explosive charging pipe, a boom mechanism carrying the<br>
explosive charging pipe, boom actuators, a control circuit and an explosive charging<br>
pipe. U.S. Patent No. 5,611,605 describes a method, apparatus and cartridge for non-<br>
explosive rock fragmentation which involves drilling a hole into a rock, and inserting a<br>
propellant cartridge into a charging housing with a means for igniting the propellant,<br>
and forcing the propellant cartridge through a charging hose and into the hole to ignite<br>
the propellant. The apparatus and cartridge of '605 are inserted using a boom device.<br>
[0015] It is known to use pressurized fluids in a hole to break rocks. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,339,992 ('992) shows a small charge blasting apparatus including an apparatus<br>
for sealing pressurized fluids in holes. The invention therein provides a relief volume<br>
for a pressurized working fluid in the bore of a barrel that is inserted into a hole in the<br>
material to be broken. The invention seals the fluid into the hole while a gas-generator<br>
4<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCI/US2006/007866<br>
generates greater pressure. The requirement of a separate apparatus for sealing<br>
pressurized fluids into bore holes is inconvenient especially in any emergency rescue<br>
operations where the least amount of equipment, especially bulky equipment, in most<br>
desirable.<br>
[0016] Numerous diverse methods and apparatuses have been developed to aid in<br>
breaking rock and other hard surfaces. U.S. Patent No. 5,573,307 ('307) describes a<br>
method and apparatus for blasting hard rock using a highly insensitive energetic<br>
material ignited with a moderately high-energy electrical discharge causing the<br>
fracturing and break up of hard rock. The blasting apparatus of '307 has a reusable<br>
blasting probe which includes a high voltage electrode and a ground return electrode<br>
separated by an insulating tube. The two electrodes of the blasting probe are in<br>
electrical contact with a metal powder and oxidizer mixture that will generate an<br>
exothermic reaction upon generation of an electric current therebetween creating a gas<br>
expansion to fracture the rock.<br>
[0017] U.S. Patent No. 2,587,243 ('243) describes a cutting apparatus, which<br>
produces a very high velocity gaseous penetrating jet for cutting materials or objects<br>
using a chemical charge. No borehole is drilled prior to the use of the '243 apparatus.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,208,381 shows a device for loading bore holes with explosives in<br>
bar-shaped or tubular packages, which device is a generally tubular sleeve constructed<br>
of resilient material to receive one end of an explosive package.<br>
[0018] A variety of cartridges are used in the related art. Cone-shaped blasting<br>
cartridges or plugs are designed to contain or control the explosion in a drilled/bore<br>
hole. U.S. Patent No. 5,705,768 shows a shaped charge to be placed into a bore hole,<br>
which shaped charge includes an elongate housing having a concave recess in an upper<br>
end, an explosive located within the housing and below the recess, and a detonator<br>
positioned beneath the recess and explosive.<br>
[0019] Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 2,296,504 ('504) teaches a blasting plug designed<br>
to control the level of explosion resulting from the detonation of dynamite, and prevent<br>
an uncontrolled explosion and resultant fire hazard. The method of using the device of<br>
'504 involves inserting the device in a borehole and detonating the device remotely.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,900,578 describes a method of breaking slabs that involves drilling<br>
bore holes along a desired break line, inserting a detonating cord therein, filling the<br>
bore, holes with a shock transmitting/moderating composition, and detonating the<br>
detonation cord.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
[0020] U.S. Patent No. 1,585,664 ('664) shows a method and apparatus for<br>
breaking rock which utilizes projectiles (similar to bullets) and a forcible ejection<br>
means attached to a boom. The projectiles are fired at the surface of the rock. The<br>
'664 invention demonstrates that the use of bullet-like explosives is known in the art.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,069,130 describes a propellant igniter. U.S. Patent No. 4,900,092<br>
discloses a barrel for a rock breaking tool and method for breaking rock which involves<br>
drilling a hole in rock, filling the hole with water, inserting a short barrel of a rock<br>
breaking tool into the hole entrance, covering the tool with a recoil restraining mat, and<br>
discharging a cartridge down the barrel.<br>
[0021] None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singularly or in<br>
combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Specifically, these<br>
devices lack the simplicity and portability desired for truly small-scale rock breaking,<br>
and especially, for rock breaking that must not generate an explosion of any significant<br>
force.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] The present invention relates to a tool designed for the small scale cracking<br>
and demolition of solid materials, including but not limited to rock and masonry. In<br>
particular the present invention relates to a remote pneumatic detonation tool that is<br>
used in splitting off part of a rock or other hard material. The term "rock" when used<br>
herein shall include any suitable hard material, such as concrete. The present invention<br>
further contemplates a kit incorporating the rock-breaking tool, and a method of using<br>
the tool and kit to break rock by creating a small explosion in the bottom of a hole<br>
drilled in the rock. This type of drill hole is frequently referred to as a borehole.<br>
Presently, the kit contains the tool, a rubber bulb hole blower, hose, pump, two tapered<br>
drift pins, and an instruction manual. The kit may further contain a brush for cleaning<br>
the borehole.<br>
[0023] The tool (12) for breaking hard, material, according to the present invention,<br>
has a body (14) having an opening (16) therethrough forming a barrel (18). The barrel<br>
(18) has a top and a bottom (20 and 22), an opening (30) at the bottom (22) extending<br>
through the body (14), and a pressure input (44) for fluid communication into the barrel<br>
(18). The barrel (18) receives a piston (24) therein, and has a magnet (23) at the top<br>
(20) of the barrel (18). The magnet (23) is contiguous with the pressure input (44)<br>
allowing air to be pumped into the barrel (18) past the magnet (23). In the cocked<br>
position, the piston (24) is in contact with the magnet (23). An actuator pin tube (26) is<br>
6<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
received in the opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel (18), and an actuator pin<br>
(38) is slidably engaged therein. A second opening (28) may be provided in the top ()<br>
of the barrel (18) for engaging the magnet (23), piston (24), actuator pin tube (26), and<br>
actuator pin (38).<br>
[0024] A kit (110) containing the tool (12), hose (94), a package (120) of cartridges<br>
(84), a rubber bulb hole blower (112), two tapered drift pins (118), a borehole cleaning<br>
brush (122), an instruction manual (124), and a device (P) for communicating pressure<br>
into the hose taken from the group consisting of pump, bike pump, CO2 cartridge, and<br>
the like. A method of using the tool (12) is also contemplated. Multiple tools (12) may<br>
be detonated at the same time by hooking them up to a manifold (95 or 95').<br>
[0025] The present invention may be used by a large variety of potential users<br>
including excavators, blasting contractors, farmers, geologists, park trail builders,<br>
demolition contractors, prospectors, mining operations, road departments, landscapers,<br>
quarry operations, tactical personnel including police and armed services, structure<br>
collapse rescue teams, cave rescue and exploration groups. Equipment rental centers<br>
may also have use for such devices.<br>
[0026] An aspect of the present invention is that the tool and method require very<br>
small diameter boreholes, which are typically about 0.375 inches or smaller, which can<br>
be more easily drilled by cheaper and more readily available consumer level<br>
equipment. Other methods of cracking hard material require the drilling of relatively<br>
large holes, generally an inch in diameter or larger. Alternatively, other methods<br>
require strenuous and often dangerous manual labor. The drilling equipment used to<br>
accomplish the other methods is expensive and generally requires high skill levels to<br>
operate.<br>
[0027] Another aspect of the present invention is that the tool and method generate<br>
a relatively low energy output. This low energy output allows operators to use the tool<br>
and method in environments sensitive to the use of higher energy methods and devices.<br>
[0028] Yet another aspect of the present invention is the portability of the tool.<br>
Since the device is quite small, it can be transported almost anywhere. An example of<br>
the usefulness of the small configuration of the tool is the potential use miles<br>
underground to open passages in caves for rescue or exploration. The tool easily fits<br>
into a hand held carry case with all the essential equipment needed to operate the tool.<br>
[0029] A further aspect gained by the small size and relative simplicity of the<br>
system is its projected low cost to own and operate. This coupled with the elimination<br>
7<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
of large borehole drilling devices will allow many more people to successfully and<br>
economically deal with demolition problems in a far easier manner than has previously<br>
been available.<br>
[0030] Since the tool's uses are not typically governed by blasting regulations and<br>
license requirements in most areas, the tool saves the users money by eliminating the<br>
expenses and logistics of hiring separate highly trained and licensed personnel. The<br>
tool also eliminates the risks of collateral damage to nearby property, which is always a<br>
concern when using high explosives. Many municipalities now have outright bans on<br>
the use of high power explosives within their jurisdictions which forces contractors to<br>
use track loader mounted hydraulic demolition hammers, pneumatic jack hammers, or<br>
expensive and slow acting hydraulic cements to crack materials. All of these methods<br>
can cost many times as much as using the present invention and can severely delay<br>
projects when unexpected obstacles are encountered.<br>
[0031] Yet another aspect of the present invention is that several tools may be<br>
detonated simultaneously by using a manifold. This aspect of the present invention may<br>
facilitate precision blasting where very discrete breaks are desired. Such uses are<br>
beneficial in breaking rock associated with rescue, cave, trail, and the like, and<br>
elsewhere, especially where equipment must be carried manually.<br>
[0032] These and other aspects of the present invention will become readily<br>
apparent upon further review of the following drawings and specification.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0033] The novel features of the described embodiments are specifically set forth in<br>
the appended claims; however, embodiments relating to the structure and process of<br>
making the present invention, may best be understood with reference to the following<br>
description and accompanying drawings.<br>

(84) in the proper position in the borehole (B). FIG. 2 shows the tool (12) in an<br>
uncocked or released position. The tool (12) of FIG. 2 is shown relative to an average<br>
human hand (H) demonstrating the size of a preferred embodiment of the tool (12) of<br>
the present invention. Nonetheless, the tool (12) may be of different dimension and is<br>
not restricted to the general size shown. FIG. 3 is a view of the cartridge (84) used with<br>
the present invention. The cartridge (84) are also disclosed in the published patent<br>
application, US 2005/0257,675 Al, all of the contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
in their entirety by reference.<br>
[0045] The tool (12) for breaking hard material, according to the present invention,<br>
has a body (14) having an opening (16) therethrough forming a barrel (18), which can<br>
be seen most clearly in the exploded view of the tool (12) depicted in FIG. 4. The barrel<br>
(18) has a top and a bottom (20 and 22), an opening (30) at the bottom (22) extending<br>
through the body (14), and a pressure input (44) for fluid communication into the barrel<br>
(18). The barrel (18) receives a piston (24) therein, and has a magnet (23) at the top<br>
9<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
(20) of the barrel (18). The magnet (23) is contiguous with the pressure input (44)<br>
allowing air to be pumped into the barrel (18) past the magnet (23). In the cocked<br>
position, shown in FIG. 1, the piston (24) is in contact with the magnet (23). In the<br>
released position, shown in FIG. 2, the piston (24) is in contact with a strike sensitive<br>
throw, such as a retention head (42) of an actuator pin (38), as discussed hereafter,<br>
adjacent the bottom (22) of the barrel (18). An actuator pin tube (26) is received in the<br>
opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel (18).<br>
[0046] As used herein, the term "barrel" is not limited to a cylindrical shape but<br>
may also encompass alternative shapes as long as opposing sides of the barrel are<br>
parallel thereby permitting the piston to move freely from the magnet (23) disposed at<br>
the first end of the barrel (18) to the second end thereof. The term "piston" is<br>
conventionally defined as a metallic cylinder sliding within a tube; specifically, a<br>
metallic cylinder that slides up and down inside a tubular housing, receiving pressure<br>
from or exerting pressure on a fluid. The piston (24) herein may be comprised of a<br>
ferrous metal attracted to a magnet, or of another composition having such a metal<br>
formed into the top of the piston (24). The barrel (18) of the present invention is<br>
analogous to the conventional tubular housing except that the barrel (18) need not be<br>
tubular but could instead have a square or oval cross section provided however that the<br>
piston (24) has a complimentary shape and may free slide up and down the barrel (18)<br>
from the magnet to strike the retention head (42) of the actuator pin (38).<br>
[0047] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the body (14) may be<br>
comprised of carbon steel. The barrel (18) may be a 9/16-inch hole with the threaded<br>
opening (28) extending 3/8 inch into the barrel (18) wherein the entire barrel goes down<br>
2 5/8 inches to the opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel (18) with the fitted<br>
opening (30) extending therebelow. A second opening (28) may be disposed at the top<br>
(20) of the barrel (18) to allow the magnet (23) and the piston (24) to be inserted<br>
therethrough. In a preferred embodiment, the magnet (23) is disposed on a cap (70)<br>
engaged in the second opening (28) at the top (20) of the barrel (18). A preferred cap<br>
(70) has a screw (60) engaged in a washer (58) engaged in a rubber washer (56) with a<br>
plug (68) holding them in place relative to the barrel (18), as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[0048] The actuator pin tube (26) has a first end (32) and a second end (34). An<br>
opening (36) extends throughout the actuator pin tube (26) for slidably engaging an<br>
actuator pin (38). The first end (32) of the actuator pin tube (26) is engaged securely in<br>
the opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel (18), and the second end (34) of the<br>
10<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
actuator pin tube (26) extends from the opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel<br>
(18). The actuator pin tube (26), which may be composed of a hardened tool steel, may<br>
have an external diameter of 5/16 inch and an internal diameter of 1/8 inch, and a<br>
length of 8 14 inches with 8 inches exposed.<br>
[0049] The actuator pin (38) has a tip (40) and a retention head (42) at opposing<br>
ends (41 and 43), as shown most clearly in FIG. 4. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
retention head (42) may have a 1/4  inch diameter and be 1/8-inch long. The retention<br>
head (42) is wider than the opening (36) in the actuator pin tube (26). The actuator pin<br>
(38) is longer than the actuator pin tube (26) permitting the tip (40) to extend through<br>
the second end (34) of the actuator pin tube (26), as shown in FIG. 2. The actuator pin<br>
(38) may be 8 7/8 inches long with 1/8 inch diameter and a hemispherical tip (40).<br>
[0050] The piston (24) has a top (52) and a bottom (54), and is slidably disposed in<br>
the barrel (18) between the magnet (23) and the retention head (42). The magnet (23)<br>
attracts and holds the top (52) of the piston (24) with a force M when in partial contact<br>
therewith. The pressure input (44) is in fluid communication with the top (52) of the<br>
piston (24) for forcefully dislodging the piston (24) upon applying pressure through the<br>
pressure input (44) such that the piston (24) strikes the retention head (42) forcing the<br>
tip (40) to strike the primer (102) disposed at the top of the cartridge (84), causing the<br>
propellant (96) to forcefully expand and crack the rock (R). The bottom (100) of the<br>
cartridge (84) is positioned in the borehole (B) such that the primer (102) is in contact<br>
with the tip (40). The bottom (54) of the piston (24) may have a complimentary shape<br>
to the bottom (22) of the barrel (18), as shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4.<br>
[0051] The pressure input (44) is disposed substantially perpendicular to the barrel<br>
(18) and adjacent to the magnet (23). A tubing or hose (94) is in fluid communication<br>
with the pressure input (44) for increasing the pressure in the top (52) of the piston (24)<br>
so that the magnet (23) will release the piston (24) when magnetic flux is overcome<br>
allowing it to strike the head (42) of the pin (38). The pressure input (44) may be an<br>
opening and, in a preferred embodiment shown in FIGS 5a through 5d, may have a first<br>
part (82) with a first diameter, a second part (84) with a second diameter that is<br>
narrower than the diameter of the first part (82), and an inner collar (86). The first part<br>
(82) may be threaded to accommodate a nut (88) with an external threaded fitting and<br>
an opening therethrough, the second part (84) may accommodate a thermo plastic<br>
angular ring (90) with an opening therethrough. The tubing or hose (94) extends<br>
through the nut (88), the angular ring (90) and the inner collar (86). The tubing (94)<br>
11<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
engaged in the opening may be further supported with an inner support tube (92) which<br>
keeps the hose or tubing (94) from collapsing when nut (88) is tightened. A collar (93)<br>
may be disposed on one end of the inner support tube (94) to prevent the tube (94) from<br>
becoming dislodged into the tubing or hose (94).<br>
[0052] A means for generating pressure in fluid communication with the pressure<br>
input (44) is used to dislodge the piston (24) from the magnet (23). Typically, the<br>
tubing or hose (94) is in fluid communication with a pump (P) of some sort; however,<br>
any well know method of increasing pressure is contemplated hereby, including air<br>
compressors, air storage tanks, CO2 cylinders, and the like. The term pump (P) as used<br>
herein incorporates any pressure source.<br>
[0053] Additional modifications include the barrel (18) having at least one pressure<br>
output (112) disposed adjacent the bottom (22) of the barrel (18) allowing fluid<br>
pressure to be released from beneath the bottom (54) of the piston (24). The pressure<br>
output (112) may serve as a sighting mechanism for visually determining whether the<br>
actuator pin (38) is properly positioned. The pressure output (112) serves as a sight hole<br>
in the body (14) and a visual indicator (114) disposed on the retention head (42) of the<br>
actuator pin (38), wherein the visual indicator (114) is visible through the sight hole<br>
(112) when the actuator pin (38) is in proper position relative to a cartridge (84), as<br>
shown in FIG. 1. In operation, a person can see the visual indicator (114) through the<br>
output (112) when they position their eye (116) accordingly.<br>
[0054] An anchor device which may comprise two anchor openings (79), shown in<br>
FIG. 4, designed to accommodate anchor cords, are disposed through the body (14).<br>
The two anchor openings (79) are disposed substantially perpendicular to the barrel<br>
(18), for applying restraining forces upon the tool (12) preventing the tool's (12)<br>
dislodgement do to the effect of gravity from a borehole (B) during detonation of<br>
cartridge (84). In a preferred embodiment, the anchor openings (79) may be 3/8-inch<br>
openings. Alternative anchor devices which can be attached to the body (14), as are<br>
well known, may be used. Such devices include holes extending though the body (14)<br>
as shown or in other positions, brackets attached to the body (14), or other means to<br>
hold the tool (12) in position.<br>
[0055] The actuator mechanism of the present invention represents a one-way<br>
pneumatic actuator having a body (14) having an opening (16) therethrough forming a<br>
barrel (18). The barrel (18) has a top and a bottom (20 and 22), an opening (30) at the<br>
bottom (22) thereof, and a pressure input (44) for fluid communication into the barrel<br>
12<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
(18). The barrel (18) receives a piston (24) therein, and has a magnet (23) at the top<br>
(20) of the barrel (18) that is contiguous with the pressure input (44). The piston (24)<br>
has a top (52) and a bottom (54), and is slidably disposed in the barrel (18) between the<br>
magnet (23) and the opening (30). The magnet (23) attracts and holds the top (52) of<br>
the piston (24) with a force M when in partial contact therewith. The pressure input<br>
(44) is in fluid communication with the top (52) of the piston (24) for forcefully<br>
dislodging the piston (24) upon applying pressure through the pressure input (44) such<br>
that the piston (24) strikes the retention head (42). A strike sensitive throw, such as the<br>
actuator pin (38), is actuated by being struck by the bottom (54) of the piston (24) upon<br>
contact therewith. A second opening (28) may be disposed at the top (20) of the barrel<br>
(18), and the magnet (23) may be disposed on a cap (70) engaged in the second opening<br>
(28) at the top (20) of the barrel (18).<br>
[0056] A method of breaking hard material using the tool (12), according to the<br>
present invention, involves providing a hose or tubing (94) in fluid communication with<br>
a pump (P) and the pressure input (44). A cartridge (84) is provided having a tubular<br>
shaped casing (96) with a closed bottom (100) at one end and a primer (102) at the<br>
opposing end and a propellant (98) interspersed therebetween the bottom (100) and the<br>
primer (102). A borehole (B) is drilled in a hard material (R) wherein the borehole (B)<br>
will accommodate the full length of the actuator pin tube (26) which extends from the<br>
opening (30) at the bottom (22) of the barrel (18). The borehole (B) is cleaned. An air<br>
blower (112) and a brush (122) may be used to thoroughly clean the borehole (B). The<br>
cartridge (84) is then inserted all the way into the borehole (B) so the primer (102) will<br>
come into contact with the tip (40) of the actuator pin (38) once the actuator pin tube<br>
(26) is engaged in the borehole (B). The tool (12) is shaken to assure free movement of<br>
the actuator pin (38) so that the tip (40) will slidably extend from the second end (34)<br>
of the actuator pin tube (26). The actuator pin tube (26) is then inserted into the<br>
borehole (B) such that the tip of the actuator pin (38) meets the primer (102) of the load<br>
cartridge (84). The hose (94) is then extended to its full length. The pump (P) is then<br>
activated to detonate the cartridge (84). The present invention is not limited to the<br>
pump (P) shown but may incorporate any other device for increasing pressure in the<br>
tubing (94).<br>
[0057] Additionally, the actuator pin (28) is appropriately positioned relative to the<br>
bottom (42) of the piston (24) and the primer (102) of the load cartridge (84) by using a<br>
sighting mechanism (112) for visually determining whether the actuator pin (38) is<br>
13<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/096615	PCT/US2006/007866<br>
properly positioned. Furthermore the tool (12) may be anchored by guiding cord<br>
through the openings provided. Additional mechanisms may be provided to evenly<br>
distribute forces, and retain the tool in the proper firing position.<br>
[0058] A manifold (95 and 95') such as that shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 may be used to<br>
detonate multiple tools (12) at one time. FIG. 8 is an environmental view of a manifold<br>
(95) with three hoses (94) attached to it. Such manifolds (95 and 95') are well known,<br>
and may be provided with pressure release valves and control valves for proper<br>
operation. This permits the operator to eliminate pressure from the tool (12) to avoid<br>
unintentional actuation. Conventional manifold and quick connectors may be used to<br>
connect the hose in a conventional manner. A manifold with a three way slide valve<br>
may be used as is well known in the art. This allows resetting the pneumatic rock<br>
breaking tool (12) without having to disconnect the tools (12) from the hose (94). The<br>
term "manifold" is not limited to the examples shown here and is seen to cover any<br>
pipe fitting with several lateral outlets for connecting one pipe with others that<br>
distributes the air flow from the one pipe evenly to the other pipes. The tool (12) is<br>
reset by turning it upside-down allowing the piston (24) to contact the magnet (23).<br>
[0059] A kit (110) containing a pneumatic rock breaking tool (12) is shown in FIG.<br>
9. The kit may contain a rubber bulb hole blower (112), two tapered drift pins (118) for<br>
wedging apart cracked material, a borehole cleaning brush (122), an instruction manual<br>
(124), and a pump (P) for communicating pressure into the hose (94) such as a bike<br>
pump, CO2 cartridge, and the like. A small cylinder of CO2 may be used as an<br>
alternative pressure source to trigger the system. Commercially available 12 and 20<br>
ounce CO2 cylinder coupled with available pressure regulator feeding manifold/valve<br>
system may be advantageous. Pneumatic quick-connect couplings or other equivalent<br>
couplings may be used to connect the hose to the air pressure supply and the manifold,<br>
if present.<br>
