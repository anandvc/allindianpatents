End hose for discharge of thick substances<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to an end hose for discharge of thick<br>
substances, particularly of liquid concrete, which can be<br>
connected with its entry-side end to a pressure feed line and has<br>
a discharge opening for the thick substances at its exit-side<br>
end, and which consists of flexible material.<br>
End hoses of this type are, for example, components of a feed<br>
device for liquid concrete. There, they form the end of a<br>
pressure feed device, whose pressure feed lines can be disposed<br>
on the concrete distributor mast of a stationary or mobile<br>
concrete pump. The end hose is connected, at its entry-side end,<br>
with the pressure feed line to which liquid concrete is applied<br>
by way of a pump, and hangs vertically down from the mast tip in<br>
the operating state. In order for an operator (end hose operator)<br>
to be able to guide it, with its discharge opening, to an<br>
application site, by hand, within a certain circumference, it has<br>
not only its articulated suspension on the mast tip but also a<br>
certain flexibility. Therefore it consists predominantly of a<br>
flexible material, for example of rubber or of an elastomer<br>
plastic. In the feed of thick substances of this type, blockage<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
formations in the feed lines or in the end hose can always occur,<br>
again and again. Such blockages are generally loosened by means<br>
of building up a corresponding excess pressure in the pressure<br>
feed line. Greater forces occur at the end hose when blockages<br>
are loosened, and because of the flexibility of the end hose,<br>
these forces can cause the end hose to kick out. Kicking out of<br>
the end hose can also occur when the thick substance column is<br>
first pumped up, or if air inclusions are released. In this<br>
connection, situations that are hazardous for the operator can<br>
occur, when the operator can no longer keep hold of the end hose.<br>
Proceeding from this, the invention is based on the task of<br>
improving the end hose of the type indicated initially in such a<br>
manner that the risk of the end hose kicking out when blockages<br>
are loosened is reduced.<br>
To accomplish this task, the combination of characteristics<br>
indicated in claim 1 is proposed. Advantageous embodiments and<br>
further developments of the invention are evident from the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The solution according to the invention proceeds from the idea<br>
that at least two hose parts having different bending rigidity,<br>
connected with one another at a transition point, are provided. A<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention provides that the bending<br>
rigidity of the exit-side hose part is greater than that of the<br>
entry-side hose part. It is advantageous if the lower bending<br>
rigidity is achieved by means of a lesser hardness. The region of<br>
lesser hardness makes it possible to position and distribute the<br>
exiting thick-matter material, while the region of greater<br>
rigidity and hardness prevents the end hose from kicking out<br>
during the pressure discharge.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
hose parts having different bending rigidity accordingly have an<br>
elastomer material having different material hardness. The hose<br>
parts having different bending rigidity can have a different wall<br>
thickness while having the same hose material. In particular, in<br>
this connection, the wall thickness of the hose parts is<br>
configured to be increasing or decreasing in the transition<br>
region, whereby it is practical if the inside diameter in the<br>
hose parts having different bending rigidity is constant.<br>
It is advantageous if at least one of the hose parts has a woven<br>
fabric insert. The woven fabric inserts in the hose parts having<br>
great rigidity can be more tightly braided or woven, in this<br>
connection, than in the hose part having low rigidity. The same<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
can be done by means of a change in the distance of the insert<br>
from the bending line.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment variant consists of the fact that<br>
at least one of the hose parts has a material having greater<br>
strength, e.g. a steel wire insert. Here again, the insert amount<br>
or density can be selected to be different in the different hose<br>
parts. In a special case, the steel wire insert in the hose part<br>
having greater rigidity can be wound more tightly than in the<br>
hose part having lower rigidity.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment of the invention provides that<br>
the hose part having greater rigidity has a steel wire insert and<br>
the hose part having lesser rigidity has a woven fabric insert.<br>
When using a hose material made of a wound plastic non-woven<br>
fabric, e.g. carbon fiber reinforced plastic, woven fiber<br>
reinforced plastic, or compound non-woven fabric, the different<br>
bending thickness can also be achieved by means of different<br>
winding density.<br>
It is advantageous if the hose parts having different bending<br>
rigidity are connected with one another in one piece at the<br>
transition point.  Fundamentally,  however,  it is also possible<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
that  the  hose parts  having  different  bending  rigidity  are<br>
releasably coupled with one another at the transition point.<br>
The end hoses according to the invention are preferably used in<br>
connection with pressure feed lines for thick substances,<br>
particularly for liquid concrete, whereby the end hose is<br>
disposed at the end of the pressure feed line. In this<br>
connection, it is practical if the pressure feed line is disposed<br>
on a distributor mast of a stationary or mobile thick-matter<br>
pump, which mast has several mast arms connected with one another<br>
at bending joints. The pressure feed line in turn is composed of<br>
several segments that carry the end hose at their one end. The<br>
feed line segments can consist of a metal, preferably of steel,<br>
or of a composite material, preferably of fiber-reinforced<br>
plastic with a friction-wear-resistant inner coating.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in greater<br>
detail using exemplary embodiments shown schematically in the<br>
drawing. This shows:<br>
Fig. 1        the mast tip of a distributor mast of a mobile<br>
concrete pump having an end hose;<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Fig. 2a to 2f different variants of an end hose having different<br>
bending rigidity over the length, in a<br>
representation in partial section, and reduced in<br>
length.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the mast tip 10 of a distributor mast, not shown for<br>
the remainder, configured as a bending mast, of a mobile concrete<br>
pump, which carries an end hose 12 that hangs vertically down in<br>
an operating state, which hose is connected with a pressure feed<br>
line 14 to which concrete is applied by way of a pump, guided<br>
along the concrete distributor mast at its upper end, and through<br>
the outlet opening 16 of which hose,  which faces down,  the<br>
transported liquid concrete exits into an application site on the<br>
construction site. The end hose 12 carries a metallic connector<br>
piece 20 on its entry-side end 18,  with which piece it is<br>
connected with the exit-side end 22 of the pressure feed line 14,<br>
so as to rotate. So that the operator 24 (end hose operator) can<br>
pivot the end hose 12 when the mast tip 10 is standing in place,<br>
in a certain circumference above the application site, the end<br>
hose 12 consists of a flexible material, for example of rubber or<br>
of an elastomer plastic. On the other hand, the flexibility of<br>
the end hose 12 is not allowed to be so great, particularly in<br>
the exit-side lower region, that kicking out of the end hose can<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
occur when loosening blockages, since this could represent a<br>
hazard for the operator 24.<br>
In order to achieve this, the end hose 12 consists, in the case<br>
of the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1, of two hose parts<br>
26, 28, of which the upper hose part 26 has a lesser bending<br>
rigidity, and the lower hose part 28 has a greater bending<br>
rigidity. The two hose parts 26, 28 are connected with one<br>
another, in one piece, in a transition region 30.<br>
The exemplary embodiments shown schematically in Fig. 2a to 2f<br>
show different variants for the internal structure of an end hose<br>
having hose parts having different rigidity.<br>
In the case of the embodiment variant shown in Fig. 2a, the end<br>
hose consists of a rubber material that is uniform over the<br>
entire length, which contains a woven fabric insert 32 in the<br>
region of the upper hose part 26 and a steel wire insert 34 in<br>
the region of the lower hose part 28. In the transition region<br>
30, the woven fabric insert 32 and the steel wire insert 34 are<br>
linked with one another. The structure material 36, which<br>
consists of rubber, has the same Shore hardness over the entire<br>
length of the end hose 12. The different bending rigidity of the<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
two hose parts 26 and 28 results exclusively from the different<br>
flexibility of the inserts 32, 34.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2b, a<br>
woven fabric insert that is continuous from the top to the bottom<br>
is provided. The structure material 36, which consists of rubber,<br>
consists of rubber having the same Shore hardness throughout. The<br>
different bending rigidity is achieved in that the woven fabric<br>
insert 3 8 has a greater mesh width in the region of the upper<br>
hose part 26 than in the region of the lower hose part 28. The<br>
woven fabric insert 38 is also not interrupted in the transition<br>
region 30. Instead, all that happens there is that the mesh width<br>
is changed, constantly or in steps, from top to bottom. With<br>
these measures, as well, a greater bending rigidity is obtained<br>
in the lower hose part 28 than in the upper hose part 26.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2c,<br>
there is a woven fabric insert 4 0 having a constant mesh width in<br>
the upper and lower hose part 26, 28. Here, the end hose 12 is<br>
composed of two partial hoses that contain a softer rubber<br>
mixture, forming the upper hose part 26, and a harder rubber<br>
mixture in the lower hose part 28. The transition region 30 is<br>
formed by a vulcanization region in which the two hose parts 26,<br>
2 8 have been vulcanized onto one another.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2d, a<br>
hose having a continuous woven fabric insert 42 and a uniform<br>
structure material 36 is provided. In the lower part, an<br>
additional elastomer cover hose 44 is vulcanized on, to form the<br>
lower hose part 2 8 that has greater bending rigidity.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2e, a<br>
continuous rubber hose with a woven fabric insert 46 is provided,<br>
the inside diameter of which is constant and which has a smaller<br>
wall thickness in the region of the upper hose part 22 than in<br>
the region of the lower hose part 28. The wall thickness of the<br>
hose constantly increases in the transition region 30, from top<br>
to bottom.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 2f essentially corresponds<br>
to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 2d. Here again, a<br>
rubber hose with a continuous woven fabric insert 42 is provided,<br>
onto which a cover hose 44 is vulcanized. Here, a metal spiral 48<br>
is let into the cover hose 44, which makes it possible to reduce<br>
the wall thickness of the cover hose 4 0 while keeping the bending<br>
rigidity the same, as compared with the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 2d.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
In summary, the following should be stated:<br>
The invention relates to an end hose for discharge of thick<br>
substances, particularly of liquid concrete. The end hose 12 can<br>
be connected with its entry-side end to a pressure feed line 14<br>
of a mobile thick-matter pump, and has a discharge opening 16 for<br>
the thick substances at its exit-side end, and consists of a<br>
flexible material. In order to prevent the end hose 12 from<br>
kicking out when blockages are loosened, it has at least two hose<br>
parts 26, 28 having different bending rigidity, connected with<br>
one another at a transition point 30.<br><br>
