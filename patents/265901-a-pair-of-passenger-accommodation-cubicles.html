AIRCRAFT SEAT<br>
The present invention relates to an aircraft seat convertible to a bed.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, in this specification, the term "squab" is used to mean the upholstered portion of a seat, on which an occupant of the seat rests his/her weight.<br>
Many proposals have been made to convert an aircraft seat into a bed. Generally these involve reclining a seat into a flat or nearly flat position. An example of such a seat is described in our prior European Patent No 1,074,468 ("Our Earlier European Patent"). It is known to go further than merely angling the three elements of a seat, namely the backrest, squab and leg rest. For instance in International Patent Application No WO 03/013903, in the name of Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, there is a proposal to configure the seat such that the seat backrest folds forwards for conversion to a bed, with the bed portion being formed by the backrest of the seat backrest and other surfaces (see Figure 5 of the Virgin publication). These include the folded forwards headrest, an ottoman or foot rest and a triangular area normally behind the backrest.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved aircraft seat convertible to a bed.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a passenger accommodation cubicle comprising:<br>
•	a seat convertible to a bed, having a seat configuration and a bed configuration, and defining a bed-head region of the cubicle and bed-foot region thereof;<br>
•	a non-convertible seat arranged:<br><br>
•	beside the convertible seat, in the latter's seat configuration and<br>
•	with the bed-head region of another, in-front cubicle able to be spaced in front of the non-convertible seat,<br><br>
the said cubicle being adapted to overlap the in-front cubicle with its bed-foot region beside the bed-head region of the in-front cubicle,<br>
•	a cubicle divider having:<br>
•	a bed-side portion passing alongside at least alongside the bed-head region of the convertible seat opposite from the non-convertible seat to divide the said cubicle from the bed-foot region of another cubicle able to be arranged beside and behind the said cubicle and<br>
•	a bed-head portion passing behind the bed-head region of the convertible seat and behind the non-convertible seat.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the cubicle divider additionally has both:<br>
•	a seat side portion passing alongside the non-convertible seat opposite from the convertible seat; and<br>
•	a bed foot portion in front of the bed-foot region.<br>
Preferably, the passenger accommodation cubicle includes a door or screen arranged to be closed or drawn from either of the seat side portion of the divider or the bed-head portion of the divider in front to the said bed-head portion or the said seat side portion. Further, the divider will usually include one or more storage compartment, at least in its bed-head portion.<br>
Normally the convertible bed will have:<br>
•	a seat squab,<br>
•	a seat backrest and<br>
•	a leg rest, the leg rest being hinged to the front of the seat squab for adjustment between more upright angles providing less leg support and more horizontal angles providing more leg support.<br>
In one embodiment, the seat is convertible from seat configuration to bed configuration with reclining movement of the backrest and forwards movement of the seat squab, the leg rest being hinged up with forwards movement of the seat squab. A foot-rest will usually be included -rest in the bed-foot region.<br><br>
Preferably, at least part of the backrest is arranged to be pivoted forwards to over-lie the seat squab providing an at least substantially flat head-end of the bed. Conveniently a stowage for a pillow will be provided behind the pivoted part of the back rest.<br>
In another embodiment, the convertible seat comprises:<br>
•	a seat squab,<br>
•	a seat backrest,<br>
•	a foot rest arranged spacedly from the seat squab,<br>
•	a bed portion movable between two positions:<br>
•	a first position being a use position in which it is arranged in the space between the foot rest and the seat squab and<br>
•	a second stowed position.<br>
Preferably, a part attached to the seat squab is adapted to be partially deployed from an upright stowed position as a leg rest.<br>
Preferably, wherein the stowed position of the movable bed portion is underneath the seat squab or underneath the foot rest.<br>
In one alternative for this embodiment, the movable bed portion is divided into two with one part being stowable under the seat squab and another part being stowable under the foot rest.<br>
In another alternative, the stowed position of the movable bed portion is upright, or at least substantially upright, to one side of the space. The passenger accommodation cubicle can include a bed-side shelf aligned with the bed-side portion of the cubicle divider, the movable bed portion being stowed beneath the shelf.<br>
Conveniently, the seat squab provides the head end of the bed, i.e. a support for a bed pillow. In this case, at least part of the backrest can be arranged to be pivoted forwards to over-lie the seat squab as providing an at least substantially flat<br><br>
head-end of the bed. A stowage for a pillow can be provided behind the pivoted part<br>
of the backrest.<br>
Normally the backrest and the seat squab will be arranged in a reclinable manner and provided with a leg rest lifting up with the reclining action.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an aircraft seat convertible to a bed comprising:<br>
•	a seat squab,	<br>
•	a seat backrest,<br>
•	a foot rest arranged spacedly from the seat squab,<br>
•	a bed portion movable between two positions:<br>
•	a first position being a use position in which it is arranged in the space between the foot rest and the seat squab and<br>
•	a second stowed position.<br>
To help understanding of the invention, a specific embodiment thereof will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a convertible seat in accordance with the invention in seat configuration;<br>
Figure 2 shows a similar perspective view of the seat in bed configuration;<br>
Figure 3 is plan view of the seat in the seat configuration;<br>
Figure 4 is a similar, bed-configuration, plan view;<br>
Figure 5 is a side view of the seat in the seat configuration;<br>
Figure 6 is a similar, bed-configuration, side view;<br>
Figure 7 is a side view of the leg rest, squab and back rest of the seat, showing a bed configuration head rest being deployed;<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view of a bed portion of the seat being deployed, part only of the seat being shown;<br>
Figure 9 is a similar view of a variant of the seat; and<br>
Figure 10 is another similar view of atioiher variant of the seat.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, the seat 1 is installed in a cubicle 2 able to provide privacy via a hidden, sliding/pocket door 18 drawn from within a seat-side end 3 of a divider 4 between adjacent seats to a facing panel 5 of the next divider 6 in a line of cubicle and their seats. The divider 4 provides a recessed backing 7 for the seat 1; whilst a return recess 8 provides foot rest space 9 opposite the seat. The dividers are generally S-shaped.<br>
The seat 1 is a double seat, in that it comprises a convertible seat 11 and a fixed seat 12 immediately beside each other. The fixed seat provides an alternative seating position when the convertible seat is in bed configuration and a seat for a friend when the convertible seat is in seat configuration. Not only the convertible seat, but also the fixed seat have seat belts, the latter seat's belts being provided in case of turbulence during use.<br>
The convertible seat has a seat squab 14, a backrest 15 and a leg rest 16 both pivotally connected to the seat squab. These are reclinable via a conventional mechanism - such as in Our Earlier European Patent - and no further details of the mechanism are thought necessary in this description, with the exception of what is described below. A headrest 17 is adjustable on the backrest.<br>
Before the means by which the seat is converted to a bed is described, a number of peripheral features will be mentioned:<br>
•	A wardrobe 21 is provided in the panel 5 facing the fixed seat;<br>
•	A cupboard 22 and shelves 23 are provided;<br>
•	A foot rest 24 or ottoman is provided in the recess 8. This can be used as an alternative seating position and as such is provided with a seat belt, in case of turbulence during use;<br>
•	A luggage storage 25 is provided under the foot rest;<br>
•	A wash basin 26 is provided above the foot rest;<br>
•	A television screen 27 is slidable into the recess 8 from within the divider 6;<br>
•	A shelf 28 extends at the side of the cubicle between the recess 8 and the convertible seat;<br><br>
•    A meal table 29 lifts through the shelf 28 to extend above the space 30 between the seat squab 14 and the foot rest 24.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, the seat converts to a bed having a bed-head region H and a bed-foot region F as follows:<br>
1.	A bed portion 31 is withdrawn from a stowed position, extending between the cubicle floor 32 and the shelf 28 alongside the space 30, and set up over the space 30. When not in use, the bed portion is stowed upright beneath a lid 33 in the shelf, with its lower/outer end located by pins (not shown') in tracks 34 alongside the stowed position of the bed portion. For use, the lid is opened and the bed portion is drawn up until the pins reach the top of the tracks 34. It is then swung over the space 30. A leg 35 is pivoted to the under-side of the bed portion and springs out to a strutted 36 position, in which its distal end engages with a load bearing point 37 provided in the floor of the cubicle for support of the distal end of the bed portion. The proximal end of the bed portion pivots into a position such that it is supported on a panel 38 beneath the shelf The bed portion has a rigid base 39, of which the upper part is behind a down-turned rim 33! of the lid and the lower part is behind the panel 38, when stowed, and an upholstered top 40. This is level in bed configuration with the foot rest 24.<br>
2.	The backrest is returned to its most upright position, if it was reclined, and a lower portion 41 - see Figure 6 — of it is hinged forwards to lie on top of the seat squab. The back side 42 of this portion of the backrest, now exposed, is also upholstered and comes to be level with the top of the bed portion and the foot rest. Thus these three surfaces form a level, mattress like bed surface, no part of which is compromised as regards its lying comfort by having to perform a different, passenger support function in the seat configuration of the convertible seat. A pillow 43 is stowed behind the hingeable portion of the backrest and other bedding is stowed in the storage provided elsewhere in the cubicle.<br>
Turning to Figure 9, it shows an alternative means of supporting the bed portion 131, namely via retractable abutments 132 on the seat squab and the ottoman for support of the distal corners of the bed portion. Spring loaded latches 133 are also provided for latching the bed portion in the deployed position for use or the stowed position.<br><br>
Further, Figure 10 shows another alternative in which the bed section 231 is provided as two parts 2311,2312, which are hinged to the opposing edges of the seat squab 214 and the foot rest 224. These are supported by stmts (not shown) which frictionally hold the bed section parts at angled positions when in use as leg rests. When the bed section parts are to be used horizontally, the struts are folly extended to engage non-return latches. The bed section parts can be stowed again by further raising of the parts to release the struts. Such latches are conventional and will not be further described.<br>
In a further embodiment, the seat mechanism shown in Figure 7, is set up - as described in Our Earlier European Patent - to recline to the extent that the leg rest 16 extends horizontally to the ottoman 24, with the seat squab and seat back also extending horizontally from the bed-head region towards the bed-foot region. In this alternative no separate bed portion such as 31 is provided.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
