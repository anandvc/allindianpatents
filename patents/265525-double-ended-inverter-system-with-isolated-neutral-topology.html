				<td>DOUBLE-ENDED INVERTER SYSTEM WITH<br>
ISOLATED NEUTRAL TOPOLOGY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60,952,772, filed July 30, 2007.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to vehicle drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments of the<br>
subject matter relate to hybrid vehicles having a double-ended inverter drive<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004] Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors<br>
used in such vehicles, receive electrical power from alternating current (AC)<br>
power supplies. However, the power sources (e.g., batteries) used in such<br>
applications provide only direct current (DC) power. Thus, devices known as<br>
"power inverters" are used to convert the DC power to AC power, which often<br>
utilize several of switches, or transistors, operated at various intervals to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power.<br>
[0005] Additionally, such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, often<br>
use two separate voltage sources (e.g., a battery and a fuel cell) to power the<br><br>
electric motors that drive the wheels. "Power converters," such as direct<br>
current-to-direct current (DC/DC) converters, are typically used to manage<br>
and transfer the power from the two voltage sources. Modern DC/DC<br>
converters often include transistors electrically interconnected by an inductor.<br>
By controlling the states of the various transistors, a desired average current<br>
can be impressed through the inductor and thus control the power flow<br>
between the two voltage sources.<br>
[0006] The utilization of both a power inverter and a power converter<br>
greatly increases the complexity of the electrical system of the automobile.<br>
The additional components required for both types of devices also increase the<br>
overall cost and weight of the vehicle. Accordingly, systems and methods<br>
have been developed for operating a motor coupled to multiple power sources<br>
without a DC/DC converter while maximizing the performance of the motor<br>
by utilizing dual inverter electrical systems.<br>
[0007] Prior art systems are limited to designs for three-phase motors<br>
traditionally used in automobiles. The design of many of these systems<br>
requires that two energy sources have substantially the same voltage level.<br>
Additionally, in a situation where one of the sources fails for some reason (i.e.,<br>
extreme cold temperatures), prior art designs may not accommodate operating<br>
a motor using the other source alone.<br>
[0008] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a dual inverter system to<br>
accommodate the use of energy sources with different operating<br>
characteristics to allow for cold cranking of a vehicle in the event of a failure<br>
of one of the energy sources. Other desirable features and characteristics of<br>
the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0009] An apparatus is provided for an automotive drive system. The<br>
automotive drive system comprises a four-phase motor having a first set of<br><br>
windings and a second set of windings, the first set of windings and the second<br>
set of windings being electrically isolated. A first inverter is coupled to the<br>
first set of windings. A second inverter is coupled to the second set of<br>
windings.<br>
[0010] An apparatus is provided for an inverter system for use in a vehicle<br>
having a first energy source and a second energy source. The inverter system<br>
comprises a motor having a first set of windings and a second set of windings.<br>
The first set of windings is electrically isolated from the second set of<br>
windings. The inverter system further comprises a first inverter coupled to the<br>
first energy source and adapted to drive the motor, wherein the first set of<br>
windings are coupled to the first inverter. The inverter system also comprises<br>
a second inverter coupled to the second energy source and adapted to drive the<br>
motor, wherein the second set of windings are coupled to the second inverter.<br>
A controller is coupled to the first inverter and the second inverter. The<br>
controller is configured to control the first inverter and the second inverter to<br>
achieve desired power flow between the first energy source, the second energy<br>
source, and the motor.<br>
[0011] A method is provided for controlling a four-phase motor using a<br>
double-ended inverter system coupled to a first energy source and a second<br>
energy source. The method comprises determining an operating condition and<br>
modulating the double-ended inverter system to provide power to the four-<br>
phase motor using both energy sources in response to a first operating<br>
condition. The method further comprises modulating the double-ended<br>
inverter system to provide electromagnetic charging of either energy source in<br>
response to a second operating condition and modulating the double-ended<br>
inverter system to produce an effective neutral point of the motor and provide<br>
power to the four-phase motor by either energy source in response to a third<br>
operating condition.<br>

[0021] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle, or automobile 10, according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body<br>
14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12<br>
near a respective corner of the body 14.<br>
[0022] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br>
and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and<br>
an electric motor.<br><br>
[0023] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 further includes a motor 20 (i.e., an electric motor/generator, traction<br>
motor, etc.), a first energy source 22, a second energy source 24, a power<br>
inverter assembly 26, and a radiator 28. The radiator 28 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze), and is coupled to the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 and the motor 20. In one embodiment, the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 20.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the motor 20 may also include a transmission integrated<br>
therein such that the motor 20 and the transmission are mechanically coupled<br>
to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 30.<br>
[0024] As shown, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source<br>
24 are in operable communication and/or electrically coupled to the electronic<br>
control system 18 and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
illustrated, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 may<br>
vary depending on the embodiment and may be of the same or different type.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the first energy source 22 and second energy<br>
source 24 may each comprise a battery, a fuel cell, an ultracapacitor, or<br>
another suitable voltage source. A battery may be any type of battery suitable<br>
for use in a desired application, such as a lead acid battery, a lithium-ion<br>
battery, a nickel-metal battery, or another rechargeable battery. An<br>
ultracapacitor may comprise a supercapacitor, an electrochemical double layer<br>
capacitor, or any other electrochemical capacitor with high energy density<br>
suitable for a desired application.<br>
[0025] Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a double-ended inverter system 32<br>
may be adapted to drive a motor 20 having more than three phases in<br>
accordance with one embodiment. The double-ended inverter system 32<br>
includes the motor 20, the first energy source 22, the second energy source 24,<br>
the power inverter assembly 26, and a controller 34.<br><br>
[0026] The motor 20 is a multi-phase alternating current (AC) motor and<br>
includes a first set of windings 36 (or coils) and a second set of windings 37,<br>
wherein each winding corresponds to one phase of the motor 20. Although<br>
not illustrated, the motor 20 includes a stator assembly (including the coils), a<br>
rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e.,<br>
coolant), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. The motor 20 may be<br>
an induction motor, a permanent magnet motor, or any type suitable for the<br>
desired application.<br>
[0027] In an exemplary embodiment, the motor 20 is a four-phase motor,<br>
with the first set of windings 36 and the second set of windings 37 each<br>
corresponding to electrically isolated two-phase wiring structures. It should<br>
be noted the sets of windings 36 and 37 are electrically isolated, meaning that<br>
current in each set of windings 36 and 37 may be controlled independently and<br>
differ from the current in the other set of windings 36 and 37. The sets of<br>
windings 36 and 37 may still transfer energy to the other set of windings 36<br>
and 37 electromagnetically using magnetomotive force generated by the motor<br>
20. The controller 34 may independently control the manner in which power<br>
flows from each energy source 22, 24 to achieve a desired power flow.<br>
[0028] The use of a motor 20 comprising two electrically isolated sets of<br>
windings 36 and 37 driven by two energy sources 22, 24 is desirable,<br>
particularly in an automobile 10 operating in a hybrid/electric mode, because it<br>
provides improved reliability. For example, if a first energy source 22, such as<br>
a battery in an automobile 10 fails for some reason (i.e. cold or inclement<br>
weather), the motor 20 may still by started and driven by the second energy<br>
source 24 independently, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
first set of windings 36 comprises a first phase (a) and a second phase (b). In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the spatial displacement between the first phase<br>
(a) and the second phase (b) is such that the electrical angle between the first<br>
phase and the second phase is 90° as shown. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the two phases are connected to create a first neutral point 39 within the motor<br><br><br>
20. In an exemplary embodiment, the spatial displacement between the first<br>
phase (a) and the second phase (b) is adjusted to maintain an electrical angle<br>
of 90° in the stator frame. It will be appreciated in the art that maintaining a<br>
90° electrical angle results in smooth torque production in the motor 20 in<br>
response to a balanced two-phase current excitation.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 4, providing currents to the first phase (ia)<br>
and the second phase (ib) which are 90° out of phase in the time domain results<br>
in a smooth rotating magnetic field. This is shown by the current flowing to<br>
the first neutral point 39 (iab_n) which is a sum of the two phase currents (4 and<br>
ib).<br>
[0031] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the second set of windings 37<br>
comprises a third phase (c) and a fourth phase (d). For the same reasons as set<br>
forth above, in an exemplary embodiment, the spatial displacement between<br>
the third phase (c) and the fourth phase (d) is such that the electrical angle<br>
between the third phase and the fourth phase is 90°. Additionally, the spatial<br>
displacement between the two sets of windings 36 and 37 may vary depending<br>
upon the design, as shown in FIG. 3 by the symbol 0. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the spatial displacement 0 is also 90°, as shown in FIG. 2. While<br>
FIG. 3 depicts the windings 36 and 37 having a concentrated winding<br>
structure, the concept and principles discussed herein can be extended for a<br>
distributed winding structure.<br>
[0032] Additionally, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that a<br>
multi-phase motor 20 can provide additional advantages over a conventional<br>
lower phase (i.e., three-phase) machine depending on the spatial displacement<br>
of the two sets of windings 36 and 37 within the stator. For example, varying<br>
the spatial displacement between two sets of windings 36 and 37 may reduce<br>
or eliminate air gap flux harmonics and corresponding torque harmonics and<br>
rotor copper losses produced by those air flux harmonics. The spatial<br>
displacement of the windings 36 and 37 and phase-connections may be varied<br>
to suit a desired application. In an exemplary embodiment, the fundamental<br><br>
frequencies of the two inverters 38 and 40 are the same, resulting in a more<br>
sinusoidal field distribution and current.<br>
[0033] Referring again to FIG. 2, the power inverter assembly 26 includes<br>
a first inverter 38 and a second inverter 40, each including six switches (e.g.,<br>
semiconductor devices, such as transistors and/or switches) with antiparallel<br>
diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch). As shown, the switches in the<br>
inverters 38 and 40 are arranged into three pairs (or legs), with pairs 42, 44,<br>
and 46 being in the first inverter 38 and pairs 48, 50, and 52 being in the<br>
second inverter 40.<br>
[0034] In an exemplary embodiment, the first phase (a) of the first set of<br>
windings 36 of the motor 20 is electrically connected, at opposing ends<br>
thereof, between the switches of switch pair 42 in the first inverter 38 and the<br>
second phase (b) at the first neutral point 39. The second phase (b) of the first<br>
set of windings 36 is connected between the switches of pair 44 in the first<br>
inverter 38 and the first neutral point 39 as shown. The first neutral point 39 is<br>
connected between the switches of pairs 46. Similarly, the two phases (c, d)<br>
of the second set of windings 37 may be connected between the switches of<br>
pairs 48, 50, and 52 and a second neutral point 41 as shown. Additionally, in<br>
an alternative embodiment, the negative rail of the two energy sources 22, 24<br>
may also be connected in order to creating a common negative point (not<br>
shown).<br>
[0035] In this configuration, because the energy sources 22, 24 are<br>
electrically isolated, energy sources 22, 24 with different voltage levels, power<br>
ratings, operating characteristics, etc. may be used simultaneously. This is<br>
particularly advantageous compared to other inverter systems where, as a<br>
practical matter, the energy sources 22, 24 are required to be nearly identical.<br>
For example, in this case, a high voltage source (&gt; 100V) such as a fuel cell<br>
may be used with a 12 V battery to simultaneously drive the motor 20.<br>
[0036] Still referring to FIG. 2, the double-ended inverter system 32 may<br>
also include first and second capacitors 54 and 56 respectively connected in<br>
parallel with the first and second energy sources 22, 24 to smooth current<br><br><br>
ripple during operation. The controller 34 is in operable communication<br>
and/or electrically connected to the first and second inverters 38 and 40. The<br>
controller 34 is responsive to commands received from the driver of the<br>
automobile 10 (i.e. via an accelerator pedal) and provides commands to the<br>
first inverter 38 and the second inverter 40, as will be described, to control the<br>
output of the inverters 38 and 40.<br>
[0037] Referring again to FIG. 1, the electronic control system 18 is in<br>
operable communication with the motor 20, the first energy source 22, the<br>
second energy source 24, and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
shown in detail, the electronic control system 18 may include various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module (i.e., the controller 34 shown in FIG. 2) and a<br>
vehicle controller, and at leasit one processor and/or a memory which includes<br>
instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable medium) for<br>
carrying out the processes and methods as described below.<br>
[0038] During operation, the automobile 10 is operated by providing<br>
power to the wheels 16 with the electric motor 20 which receives power from<br>
the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 in an alternating<br>
manner and/or with the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24<br>
simultaneously. In order to power the motor 20, DC power is provided from<br>
the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 to the first and<br>
second inverters 38 and 40 respectively, which convert the DC power into AC<br>
power, as is commonly understood in the art. The first and second inverters<br>
38 and 40 produce AC voltages across the windings 36 and 37 (or phases). As<br>
is commonly understood, the required voltages across the windings 36 and 37<br>
of the motor 20 are dependent on the speed, commanded torque (i.e.,<br>
commanded synchronous frame currents), and other motor parameters.<br>
[0039] FIG. 5 illustrates a control system 60 for operating a motor 20 in a<br>
double-ended inverter system 32 utilizing the principles described above in<br>
accordance with one embodiment. High frequency pulse width modulation<br>
(PWM) may be employed by the controller 34 to modulate and control the<br><br><br>
inverters 38 and 40 and manage the voltage produced by the inverters 38 and<br>
40. The control system 60 includes first and second PWM blocks 68 and 70,<br>
and the double-ended inverter system 32.<br>
[0040] The controller 34 provides a control algorithm that achieves<br>
desired power flow between the first and second energy sources 22, 24 while<br>
producing the commanded torque inside the motor 20. Although not shown,<br>
the control system 60 receives a torque command for the motor 20 from which<br>
the controller 34 may determine power commands for the first energy source<br>
22 (and/or the first inverter 38) and the second energy source 24 (and/or the<br>
second inverter 40), as well as synchronous frame currents for the windings 36<br>
and 37 within the motor 20.<br>
[0041] If the motor 20 does not require the maximum power output of one<br>
energy source 22 or 24, the extra power from the energy source 22 or 24 may<br>
be used to charge the other energy source 22 or 24. For illustrative purposes<br>
and the sake of brevity, it may be discussed as though the first energy source<br>
22 produces excess power to charge the second energy source 24, however, it<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous alternative desired<br>
power flows are possible and this distinction is not limiting but made merely<br>
for reference purposes.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIG. 5 the controller 34 may provide the first and<br>
second PWM blocks 68 and 70 with modulating voltage signals v*1 and v*2.<br>
The PWM blocks 68 and 70 may generate PWM signals to operate the<br>
switches within the first and second inverters 38 and 40 to cause the desired<br>
output voltages to be applied across the windings 36 and 37 to operate the<br>
motor 20 with the required torque. The controller 34 may be configured to<br>
determine the operating mode in accordance with one embodiment . In one<br>
operating mode, the first energy source 22 may independently provide the<br>
power required by the motor 20. In another operating mode, the maximum<br>
power output of the first energy source 22 may be less than the power required<br>
by the motor 20. If the motor 20 requires power from the first energy source<br>
22, as well as power from the second energy source 24, the controller 34 may<br><br><br>
be configured to control power flow from the second energy source 24 to the<br>
motor 20 in combination with the first energy source 22 by modulating the<br>
double-ended inverter system 32.<br>
[0043] In another operating mode, the first energy source 22 may have the<br>
capability to deliver an excess amount of power (i.e., reserve power), in<br>
addition to the power required by the motor 20 to produce a commanded<br>
torque. This excess power may be supplied to and stored by the second<br>
voltage source 24 and may be considered a negative DC current in the voltage<br>
bus of the second voltage source 24 because of the indicated directions of<br>
current flow shown in FIG.2. The reserve power may be understood to be the<br>
difference between the power required by the motor 20 and the maximum<br>
power output of the first energy source 22. The controller 34 may modulate<br>
the double-ended inverter system 32 to enable electromagnetic charging of the<br>
second energy source 24 using the magnetomotive force of motor 20. In<br>
another embodiment, the controller 34 may be configured to enable<br>
electromagnetic charging of both energy sources 22, 24 in another operating<br>
mode.<br>
[0044] In a third operating mode, the first energy source 22 may fail for<br>
some reason (i.e., cold temperatures or inclement weather). In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the second energy source 24 may be designed to operate in<br>
inclement weather or cold temperatures. For example, a lithium-ion battery<br>
which performs at cold temperatures may be chosen as the second energy<br>
source 24, while the first energy source 22 may be a conventional lead acid<br>
battery. The controller 34 may detect an inability of the first energy source 22<br>
to provide power, and control power flow from the second energy source 24 to<br>
the motor 20 by modulating the double-ended inverter system 32 to produce<br>
an effective neutral point of the motor 20.<br>
[0045] Many combinations of voltage across the windings 36 and 37 may<br>
produce the required torque in the motor 20 and achieve desired power flow to<br>
(or from) the energy sources 22, 24 and the motor 20. An optimal operating<br>
point determines the modulating voltage across the terminals of the inverters<br><br><br>
38 and 40. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that conditions for<br>
determining an optimal operating point are left to the designer and will vary<br>
depending upon the application for which the motor 20 is being used, along<br>
with the types of energy sources 22, 24 selected. It will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that the control system 60 can be further modified to<br>
incorporate appropriate feedback signals and other methods known in the art<br>
to control the inverters 38 and 40, which are beyond the scope of this<br>
disclosure.<br>
[0046] One advantage of the system and/or method described above is that<br>
the electrical system used to power the motor 20 with two separate energy<br>
sources 22, 24 is greatly simplified, as a conventional DC/DC power converter<br>
is not required. Using the configuration described above allows for the<br>
possibility of using two energy sources 22, 24 with different voltage levels and<br>
operating characteristics. Additionally, in a situation where one of the sources<br>
22, 24 is unavailable for some reason (i.e., extreme cold temperatures), the<br>
double-ended inverter system 32 accommodates operating a motor 20 or cold<br>
cranking an automobile 10 using one energy source 22, 24 alone. However, as<br>
the described above, the performance of the motor 20 is not impaired as the<br>
commanded torque may still be generated within the motor 20, while allowing<br>
excess power to flow between the energy sources 22, 24.<br>
[0047] Other embodiments may utilize system and method described<br>
above in different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and<br>
aircraft), or in different electrical systems altogether, as it may be<br>
implemented in any situation where the voltages of the two sources<br>
dynamically change over a wide range. The motor 20 and the inverters 38 and<br>
40 may have different numbers of phases, and the systems described herein<br>
should not be construed as limited to a four-phase design. Other forms of<br>
energy sources 22, 24 may be used, such as current sources and loads<br>
including diode rectifiers, thyristor converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors,<br>
and/or any combination thereof.<br><br><br>
[0048] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to signal<br>
processing, data transmission, signaling, network control, and other functional<br>
aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the<br>
systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting<br>
lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent<br>
exemplary functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the<br>
various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional<br>
functional relationships or physical connections may be present in an<br>
embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0049] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br><br>
