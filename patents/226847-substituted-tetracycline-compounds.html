The entire contents of each of the aforementioned patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
15    Background of the Invention<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected from many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the<br>
20    name chlortetracyciine. Two years later, oxytetracycline became available. The<br>
elucidation of the chemical structure of these compounds confirmed their similarity and<br>
furnished the analytical basis" for the production of a third member of this group in 1952,<br>
tetracycline. A new family of tetracycline compounds, without the ring-attached methyl<br>
group present in earlier tetracyclines, was prepared in 1957 and became publicly<br>
i	25    available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972.<br>
Recently, research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic conditions and routes of administration. New tetracycline analogues have also been investigated which may prove to be equal to or more effective than the originally introduced tetracycline<br>
30    compounds. Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,165,531; 3,454,697; 3,557,280; 3,674,859; 3,957,980; 4,018,889; 4,024,272; and 4,126,680. These patents are representative of the range of pharmaceutically active tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions.<br>
Historically, soon after their.initial development and introduction, the<br>
35    tetracyclines were found to be highly effective pharmacologically against rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for<br><br>

lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence,<br>
tetracyclines became known as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent<br>
establishment of their in vitro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental<br>
infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetracyclines as a class rapidly became	,<br>
5    widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directly to the emergence of resistance to these antibiotics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal and pathogenic (e.g., pneumococci and Salmonella). The rise of tetracycline-resistant organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline 10    analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br>

5.	Methods for Synthesizing Tetracycline Compounds of the Invention<br>
The tetracycline compounds of this invention can be synthesized using the methods described in the Schemes and/or by other techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The substituted tetracycline compounds of the invention can be synthesized using the methods described in Example 1, in the following schemes and by using art recognized techniques. All novel substituted tetracycline compounds described herein are included in the invention as compounds.<br><br><br>
SCHEME 1<br>
9- and 7- substituted tetracyclines can be synthesized by the method shown in Scheme 1. As shown in Scheme 1, 9- and 7-substituted tetracycline compounds can be synthesized by treating a tetracycline compound (e.g., doxycycline, 1 A), with sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate. The resulting product is a mixture of the 7-nitro and 9-nitro isomers (IB and 1C, respectively). The 7-nitro (IB) and 9- nitro (1C) derivatives are treated by hydrogenation using hydrogen gas and a platinum catalyst to yield amines ID and IE. The isomers are separated at this time by conventional methods. To synthesize 7- or 9-substituted alkenyl derivatives, the 7- or 9-amino tetracycline compound (IE and. IF, respectively) is treated with HONO, to yield the diazonium salt (1G and 1H). The salt (1G and 1H) is treated with an appropriate reactive reagent to yield the desired compound(e.g., in Scheme 1,7-cyclopent-l-enyl doxycycline (1H) and 9-cyclopent-l-enyl doxycycline (II)).<br><br><br>
2G<br>
SCHEME 2<br>
As shown in Scheme 2, tetracycline compounds of the invention wherein R7 is a carbamate or a urea derivative can be synthesized Using the following protocol. 5ancycline (2A) is treated with NaNO2 under acidic conditions forming 7-nitro ancycline (2B) in a mixture of positional isomers. 7-nitrosancycline (2B) is then reated with H2 gas and a platinum catalyst to form the 7-amino sancycline derivative 2C). To form the urea derivative (2E), isocyanate (2D) is reacted with the 7-amino ancycline derivative (2C). To form the carbamate (2G), the appropriate acid chloride star (2F) is reacted with 2C.<br><br>
SCHEME 3<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 3, tetracycline compounds of the invention, wherein R is a heterocyclic (i.e. thiazole) substituted amino group can be synthesized using the above protocol. 7-amino sancycline (3 A) is reacted with Fmoc-isothiocyanate (3B) to produce the protected thiourea (3C). The protected thiourea (3C) is then deprotected yielding the active sancycline thiourea (3D) compound. The sancycline thiourea (3D) is reacted with an a-haloketone (3E) to produce a thiazole substituted 7-amino sancycline (3F).<br><br>
SCHEME 4<br>

Scheme 4 depicts the selective hydrogenation of the 7- position double or triple bond, in saturated methanol and hydrochloric acid solution with a palladium/carbon catalyst under pressure, to yield the product<br><br>
In Scheme 5, a general synthetic scheme for synthesizing 7-position aryl derivatives is shown. A Suzuki coupling of an aryl boronic acid with an iodosancycline compound is shown. An iodo sancycline compound (5B) can be synthesized from sancycline by treating sancycline (5A) with at least one equivalent N-iodosuccinimide<br><br>
(NIS) under acidic conditions. The reaction is quenched, and the resulting 7-iodo sancycline (5B) can then be purified using standard techniques known in the art. To form the aryl derivative, 7-iodo sancycline (5B) is treated with an aqueous base (e.g., Na2C03) and an appropriate boronic acid (5C) and under an inert atmosphere. The   _ reaction is catalyzed with a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(OAc)2). The product (5D) can be purified by methods known in the art (such as HPLC). Other 7-aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl tetracycline compounds can be synthesized using similar protocols.<br>

Stille cross couplings can be performed using an appropriate tin reagent (e.g., R-S11BU3) and a halogenated tetracycline compound, (e.g., 7-iodosancyciine). The tin reagent and the iodosancycline compound can be treated with a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or Pd(AsPb.3)2Cl2) and, optionally, with an additional copper salt, e.g., Cul. The resulting compound can then be purified using techniques known in the art.<br><br>

In the therapeutic methods of the invention, one or more tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone to a subject, or more typically a compound of the invention will be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition in mixture with conventional excipient, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic   -carrier substances suitable for parenteral, oral or other desired administration and which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds and are not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
7.	Pharmaceutical Compositions of the Invention<br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a tetracycline compound (e.g., a compound of Formula (I), (II), or (HI), or any other compound described herein) and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes substances capable of being coadministered with the tetracycline compound(s), and which allow both to perform their intended function, e.g., treat or prevent a tetracycline responsive state. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives; stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of the invention.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of fbrniihg a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are those that form nontoxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate andpalmoate [i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be<br><br>
phannaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a tetracycline compound of the invention from the reaction mixture as a phannaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a phannaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or efhanoL Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to4hose skilled in the art.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of base salts. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare phannaceutically acceptable base salts of those tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such phannaceutically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine)^ -raid the lower alkanolanamqniiim and other base salts of phannaceuticallyacceptable organic amines. The pharmaceutical]^ acceptable base addition salts of tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature may be formed with phannaceutically acceptable cations by conventional methods. Thus, these salts may be readily prepared by treating the tetracycline compound of the invention with an aqueous solution of the desired phannaceutically acceptable cation and evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a lower alkyl alcohol solution of the tetracycline compound of the invention may be mixed with an alkoxide of the desired metal and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness.<br><br>
The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered via either the oral, parenteral or topical routes. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in effective dosages, depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. Variations may occur depending upon the species of the subject being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other known compositions for treating tetracycline responsive states in a subject, e.g., a mammal. Preferred mammals include pets (e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, etc.), farm animals (cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, etc.), lab animals (rats, mice, monkeys, etc.), and primates (chimpanzees, humans, gorillas). The language "in combination with" a known composition is intended to include simultaneous administration of the composition of the invention and the known composition, administration of the composition of the invention first, followed by the known composition and administration of the known composition first, followed by the composition of the invention. Any of the therapeutically composition known in the art for treating tetracycline responsive states can be used in the methods of the invention.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by any of the routes previously mentioned, and the administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. For example, the novel therapeutic agents of this invention can be administered advantageously in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays (e.g., aerosols, etc.), creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the therapeutically-effective compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br><br>
For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may alsp be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. The compositions of the invention may be formulated such that the tetracycline compositions are released over a period of time, after administration.<br>
For parenteral administration (including intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal or intramuscular injection), solutions of a therapeutic compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For parenteral application, examples of suitable preparations include solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories.. Therapeutic compounds maybe formulated in sterile form in multiple or single dose formats such as being dispersed in a fluid carrier such as sterile physiological saline or 5% saline dextrose solutions commonly used with injectables.<br>
Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the . present invention topically when treating inflammatory conditions of the skin. Examples of methods of topical administration include transdermal, buccal or sublingual application. For topical applications, therapeutic compounds can be suitably admixed in a pharmacologically inert topical carrier such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion or a cream. Such topical carriers include water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral oils. Other possible topical carriers are liquid<br><br>
petrolatum, isopropylpalmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol 95%, polyoxyethylene monolauriate 5% in water, sodium lauryl sulfate 5% in water, and the like. In addition, materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers and the like also may be added if desired.<br>
For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees or capsules having talc and/or carbohydrate carrier binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and/or corn starch and/or potato starch. A syrup, elixir or the like can be used wherein a sweetened.vehicle is employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated including those wherein the active component is protected with differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation, multiple coatings, etc.<br>
In addition to treatment of human subjects, the therapeutic methods of the invention also will have significant veterinary applications, e.g. for treatment of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, cows, swine and the like; poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and the like; horses; and pets such as dogs and cats. Also, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat non-animal subjects, such as plants.<br>
It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compounds used in a given therapy will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, the particular site of administration, etc. Optimal administration rates for a given protocol of administration can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage determination tests conducted with regard to the foregoing guidelines.<br>
In general, compounds of the invention for treatment can be administered to a subject in dosages used in prior tetracycline therapies. See, for example, the Physicians' Desk Reference. For example, a suitable effective dose of one or more compounds of the invention will be in the range of from 0.01 to lOOmilligrams per lrilbgram of body weight of recipient per day, preferably in the range of from 0.1 to 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, more preferably in the range of 1 to 20 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient per day. The desired dose is suitably administered once daily, or several sub-doses, e.g. 2 to 5 sub-doses, are administered at appropriate intervals through the day, or other appropriate schedule. It will also be understood that normal, conventionally known precautions will be taken regarding the administration of tetracyclines generally to ensure their efficacy under normal use circumstances. Especially when employed for therapeutic treatment of humans and animals in vivo, the practitioner should take all sensible precautions to avoid conventionally known contradictions and toxic effects. Thus, the conventionally recognized adverse reactions of gastrointestinal distress and inflammations, the renal<br><br>
toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, changes in blood, and impairment of absorption through aluminum, calcium, and magnesium ions should be duly considered in the conventional manner.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also pertains to the use of a tetracycline compound of formula I, II, III, IV, or any other compound described herein, for the preparation of a medicament. The medicament may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the tetracycline compound is an effective amount, e.g., an effective amount to treat a tetracycline responsive state.<br>
