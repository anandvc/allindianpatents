				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION: <br>
This invention relates to a process for producing a plasma-deposited multi<br>
junction amorphous silicon solar cell device herein after referred to as<br>
amorphous silicon solar cell module.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Thin film solar cell modules based on plasma deposited amorphous silicon (a-Sl)<br>
have the potential for generation of tow-cost photovoltaic power. Haled in<br>
eighties as one of the most promising thin film PV technologies, these devices<br>
have, so far, failed to realize this dream on account of their lower efficiencies<br>
compared to that for crystalline silicon. The relatively lower stabilized efficiencies<br>
for these devices has primarily been attributed to the so-called Staebler-Wronsky<br>
effect (SWE) according to which amorphous silicon material, by virtue of the<br>
nature of the defects in its lattice, loses photoconductivity on exposure to light.<br>
This results in degradation in electrical performance of solar cells and brings<br>
down their efficiency.<br>
Degradation due to SWE in plasma deposited a-Si has been reduced through<br>
invention of multi junction (double and triple junction) solar cell structures where<br>
the intrinsic silicon layer (i layer), which is responsible for absorbing incident solar<br>
radiation, is split into thinner layers, each serving as a separate absorber layer in<br>
the respective p-i-n junction configuration. The total layer thickness, however,<br>
remains the same as that in a single junction device. The reduction in SWE is<br>
brought about by the fact that thinner layers of intrinsic silicon give rise to<br>
stronger electrical field across the device and the electron-hole pairs generated<br>
on absorption of light are quickly separated. This prevents creation of additional<br>
defect sites in the material, which are generated from breaking of weak Si-Si<br>
bonds due to the energy liberated from recombination of electrons and holes.<br>
While this improvement in the device configuration reduces the extent of<br>
performance degradation in a-61 solar cells upon exposure to light, contamination<br><br>
of the intrinsic layer from any other source during the fabrication process lends to<br>
nultify the beneficial effect. In particular, contamination due to boron and<br>
phosphorus atoms of the i layer adversely affects the device performance.<br>
In conventional PECVD process, it is often found advantageous to deposit the<br>
doped (p and n) and the undoped (i) layers in separate deposition chambers so<br>
as to prevent contamination of the intrinsic layer with traces of dopant atoms. In<br>
fact, the superior performance of p-i-n or n-i-p type solar cels made in multi<br>
chamber deposition systems compared to those made in single chamber<br>
systems has been well documented in literature and text books [1-4]. The reason<br>
cited has been contamination of the highly sensitive intrinsic absorber layer with<br>
boron and phosphorus atoms sticking to the chamber walls and other mechanical<br>
parts inside the chamber, which act as a virtual source of these atoms.<br>
Notwithstanding the above, there have been attempts in the past by various<br>
research groups of making single Junction modules in the single deposition<br>
chamber. The Industry leaders, however, almost invariably use multi chamber<br>
deposition systems for improved module performance and process reliability. A<br>
number of treatments [5-10], essentially following the deposition of p layer and<br>
prior to the deposition of i layer, have been suggested by various research and<br>
industrial groups to reduce the boron concentration in the deposition chamber<br>
before the onset of the deposition of i layer. These treatments range from<br>
flushing the deposition chamber with hydrogen or argon [6], nitrogen trlfluoride<br>
[6], exposing the chamber interiors with a CO2 plasma [7,8], gas flushing and<br>
brief vacuuming [9], subjecting the chamber interiors to novel oxidation<br>
treatments such as water vapour and ammonia flush [10] and growing an<br>
adapted buffer layer with high hydrogen dilution between the p and the i layer [7].<br>
Many of these treatments, e.g. exposing the chamber to CO2 plasma require the<br>
substrate to be taken out of the deposition chamber as it is likely to damage the<br>
highly vulnerable p/l interface [7]. Most of these treatments either relate to<br>
formation of devices with single p-i-n junctions and/or are Iimited to module areas<br><br>
not greater than 900 cm2. In an these studies, ultra high purity (UHP) process<br>
and dilution gases have been used in order to realize high-performance devices.<br>
This issue of single chamber deposition assumes much more significance in<br>
case of multi Junction devices made on targe areas as processing of these<br>
devices is much more complex than that for single junction devices. For double<br>
junction devices, the process involves sequential deposition of several (six to<br>
eight) thin a-Si layers, doped and undoped, under varying deposition conditions<br>
of temperature and pressure. The muti junction configurations used In some of<br>
the previous studies [9] have employed a-Si / μc-Si structures and most of the<br>
groups have TCO (Al doped ZnO) at the back junction for improved reflection<br>
and module performance. Though some groups mention triple laser-scribed, dry<br>
process for going from cell stage to module stage, there is no clear mention of<br>
the isolation and inter-connection method used by other groups.<br>
It n also well established that the usual method of series interconnecting<br>
individual cells in a monolithic module using sequential laser scribing of the TCO,<br>
a-Si and metal layers causes minimum toss of the active area, thereby enhancing<br>
the module current and efficiency [11]. However, it involves the use of expensive<br>
capital equipment - a laser scriber with dual wavelengths (0.53 and 1.06<br>
micrometer) and a machine vision for maintaining exact paratileness of the<br>
scribed lines. Also the process is not free from problem areas such as controlling<br>
the depth of focus of the laser beam so as to account for small unevennese in the<br>
glass substrates and the reduced shunts caused by debris from laser scribing.<br>
Even gross non-uniformity in the haze of the underlying TCO film affects the<br>
laser scribing process.<br>
Another demerit of this method of interconnecting cells in a large area a-Si<br>
module is that it necessitates exposing the a-Si layers to atmosphere prior to<br>
metallization to enable laser scribing on it. This increases the chances of<br>
contamination of thin layers of vulnerable semiconductor surface and if not<br>
handled with utmost care, could deleteriously affect the module performance.<br><br>
Amorphous silicon solar cell technology has the benefit of using a number of<br>
inexpensive substrates such as glass, stainless steel and plastic (polyamide).<br>
Most of the commercially available modules are made on glass substrates, which<br>
is also the substrate commonly used in laboratories for research and<br>
development purposes. In all these laboratory as wed as commercial<br>
applications, float glass is invariably used as it has a very flat surface that<br>
ensures uniformity of thickness of a-Si Urns in the plasma deposition process<br>
and also facilitates falser scribing of all three layers for isolation as weH as inter-<br>
connection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In the present invention, a process is established for large area (1 ft. X 3 ft.),<br>
double junction a-Si solar cell modules where all the doped and undoped<br>
hydrogenated amorphous and microcrystalline silicon films are deposited by<br>
plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process in a single<br>
deposition chamber. The sequential depositions are interspersed with alernate<br>
gas purging and high vacuum pumping for short durations to reduce the level of<br><br>
boron contaminant to tolerable limits, which do not adversely affect the<br>
performance of the double junction modules.<br>
Referring to Fig.1, it is seen that in making a double junction a-Si module, a<br>
transparent sheet glass plate is first coated with a transparent conductive layer<br>
by an atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) process.<br>
Based on the design voltage of the module, a number of fine fines and two wider<br>
bus bars of Ag frit are screen printed on TCO and fired at a high temperature.<br>
These lines run parallel to the longer dimension of the module and their number<br>
depends on the design voltage and current of the module. An IR iaser is<br>
employed to scribe fine lines adjacent to each of the Ag frit lines, thus forming<br>
positive contact to each of the individual cells on the glass substrate.<br>
a) Aingle chamber a-Si deposition process:<br>
The deposition of amorphous silicon layer is carried out next by RF (13.56 MHz)<br>
PECVD of stone and the dopant gases diluted with hydrogen. The depositions<br>
are carried out in a single chamber at elevated substrate temperatures. The<br>
hydrogen gas used has a purity of far lower compared to the purity level of UHP<br>
hydrogen gas (99.999 %) normally used in such processes. The device structure<br>
used is: p a-SIC:H / a-SiC:H / i a-Si:H / n μC-Si / p a-SiC:H / a-SiC:H / i a-Si:H / n<br>
a-Si.H/Ag.<br>
b) Deposition of buffer layer with graded bandgap:<br>
An alloy of silicon and carbon (a-SiC:H) material with graded band gap is used at<br>
the sensitive p/i interface in order to reduce the gap states and improve the<br>
device performance in general and Voc in particular. A natural process of<br>
pumping gases from the deposition chamber resizes the band gap grading,<br>
which is essentially linked to the concentration of methane gas in the gas<br>
mixture. The benefit of graded band gap buffer layer in improving the module<br>
performance to shown in Table 1.<br><br>
c) Decontamination process:<br>
A few brief cycles of alternate purging of the chamber with inexpensive hydrogen<br>
gat and evacuation to high vacuum with a turbomoleculer pump ensures<br>
effective removal of dopant gases from the deposition chamber before deposition<br>
of the intrinsic (1) layer.<br>
d) Deposition of micro crystalline silicon layer:<br>
The n layer in the first junction is deposited as microcrystaine silicon film with<br>
low resistivity so that it forms a recombination junction with the p layer of the next<br>
junction. The microcrystaine silicon layer is formed by a combined effect of high<br>
RF power density and high hydrogen dilution of siline. The power applied is<br>
higher in the first few minutes of deposition after which it is reduced to 50-60% of<br>
the initial value. As shown in the table below, the microcrystaine silicon film<br>
formed this way shows a conductivity of 0.5 - 1.0 Scm-1 over the area of the<br>
substrate. Also the UHP (99.9995%) hydrogen used in the process has been<br>
replaced with less pure (99.9%) hydrogen with no deterioration of the results.<br>
The data in support of this is presented in Table 2.<br>
a) Formation of back ohmic contact, Isolation and series inter-<br>
connection of cells:<br>
The back ohmic contact for the device In the form of a sputtered Ag layer is<br>
deposited next without breaking vacuum. This, in our opinion, is very important<br>
since in the conventional laser scribing process, it is mandatory to break vacuum<br>
after deposition of a-Si layers to do laser scribing before loading it again in to<br>
vacuum chamber for metallization by DC magnetron sputtering of a layer of<br>
metallic silver.<br>
This layer, to begin with, covers the entire surface of the module, acting as a<br>
common back contact for all the cells in the module. This, therefore, needs to be<br>
removed from the desired places so as to obtain the desired series-<br>
interconnection. The series-interconnection, takes place through the printed and<br>
fired Ag frit lines.<br><br>
The removal or sputtered Ag layer from desired places is carried out by a<br>
combination of screen printing and wet chemical etching. Inexpensive acid<br>
resistant ink is used as the mask, which is applied by screen-printing. The acid-<br>
resist ink left at the printed areas forms a protective coating for the thin metal<br>
layer<br>
The resultant module has all the cells interconnected in series in such a way that<br>
the module voltage as measured by making contact on the two bus bars at the<br>
two ends is essentially an algebraic sum of the voltages of the individual cells.<br>
The module current, on the other hand, is that generated by an individual cell<br>
defined by the area between the two consecutive TCO scribes.<br>
f) a-Si modules on sheet glass substrates:<br>
Thin film modules are, in general, made on very flat surfaces, such as float glass,<br>
highly polished stainless steel or plastic foils. The high degree of flatness is<br>
required form the point of view of deposition of thin layers of amorphous and<br>
microcrystalline silicon as wed as laser scribing of these layers with the aim of<br>
series-interconnection of constituent cells. In the invention described above, the<br>
requirement of a very high degree of flatness is also obviated as the processes of<br>
screen-printing and chemical etching takes place with equal effectiveness on all<br>
kinds of surfaces. The initial laser scribing of TCO layer is not very critical<br>
compared to the scribing of a-Si and metal layers. Based on these facts, it is<br>
established that the above invention can also be used with equal effectiveness<br>
on good quality sheet glass substrates for large area, double junction solar cell<br>
modules. The experimental data in support of this are provided in Table 3. It can<br>
be seen that the results are very much consistent which substantiates our claim.<br>
Since sheet glass substrates are -40 % less expensive compared to float glass<br>
substrates, this also leads to substantial cost reduction.<br>
The invention described above has been successfully tried out on a large number<br>
of double junction amorphous silicon photovoltaic modules made on targe area (1<br>
ft. X 3 ft.) glass substrates. As already mentioned above, these modules have the<br>
device configuration of glass/SnO2:F/p a-SiC/i a-SiC/i a-Si/n μc-Si/p a-SiC/i a-<br><br>
SiC/i a-Si/n a-Si/Ag. The intrinsic a-Si layers have the same band gap but<br>
different thickness for the two junctions.<br>
The current-voltage characteristic of a typical a-Si double junction module has<br>
been depicted in Fig. 2. The 30 cm width or the module has been divided into 14<br>
equal segments, each representing a constituent cell and having an area of<br>
around 180 cm2. The success of the double junction process and the cell inter-<br>
connection scheme described in the foregoing is seen from fact that an open<br>
circuit voltage of 24.52 V corresponds to an average cell voltage of 1.75 V, which<br>
is normally expected out of a high-performance double junction a-Si cell with a<br>
buffer layer.<br>
The short-circuit current of 1.38 A, which corresponds to a current density of 7.6<br>
mA/cm2, matches weH with the data obtained from the QE-A plot in Fig. 3. This<br>
can be improved further by employing different band gap materials such as a-Si<br>
and a-SIGe for absorber layer in the two junctions and a ZnO:AI back reflecting<br>
layer. There is, however, good current matching between the top and the bottom<br>
cell as has been depicted in the quantum efficiency plot of Fig. 3. The fill factor<br>
however is reasonable for a module of this size. This shows that the resistances<br>
at various interfaces including that at the n/p interface is quite low and that the<br>
series-interconnection scheme described above has been able to connect the<br>
constituent celts of a module in series without any loss of voltage. The<br>
reproducibility of the process over a long process run without any additional<br>
cleaning of the chamber is shown in Fig. 4. The process reliability and<br>
reproducibility is shown in Fig. 5 for a small batch of 28 modules. It can be seen<br>
that the more than 95% of the modules fall in the ± 2a range, which is an<br>
indicator for extremely good control over the overall process.<br>
The outdoor degradation behaviour of the modules fabricated with the above<br>
process is shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that the invented process is capable of<br>
producing large area, double junction a-Si solar cell modules that can provide<br>
stable power output in excess of 15 W, which corresponds to a stable, total area<br>
efficiency of around 5-55%.<br><br><br>
