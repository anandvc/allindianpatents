FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. More specifically this invention relates to selective PDE4 inhibition by novel compounds, e.g., 4-(substituted-phenyl)-2-pyrrolidinone compounds, methods of preparing such compounds, compositions containing such compounds, and methods of use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) represent a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of various cyclic nucleoside monophosphates (including cAMP and cGMP). These cyclic nucleotides act as second messengers within cells, and as messengers, carry impulses from cell surface receptors having bound various hormones and neurotransmitters. PDEs act to regulate the level of cyclic nucleotides within cells and maintain cyclic nucleotide homeostasis by degrading such cyclic mononucleotides resulting in termination of their messenger role.<br>
PDE enzymes can be grouped into eleven families according to their specificity toward hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP, their sensitivity to regulation by calcium, calmodulin or cGMP, and their selective inhibition by various compounds. For example, PDE 1 is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin. PDE 2 is cGMP-dependent, and is found in the heart and adrenals. PDE 3 is cGMP-inhibited, and inhibition of this enzyme creates positive inotropic activity. PDE 4 is cAMP specific, and its inhibition causes airway relaxation, anti-inflammatory and antidepressant activity. PDE 5 appears to be important<br><br>
in regulating cGMP content in vascular smooth muscle, and therefore PDE 5 inhibitors may have cardiovascular activity. Since the PDEs possess distinct biochemical properties, it is likely that they are subject to a variety of different forms of regulation.<br>
PDE4 is distinguished by various kinetic properties including low Michaelis constant for cAMP and sensitivity to certain drugs. The PDE4 enzyme family consists of four genes, which produce 4 isoforms of the PDE4 enzyme designated PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D [See: Wang et al., Expression, Purification, and Characterization of human cAMP-Specific Phosphodiesterase (PDE4) Subtypes A, B, C, and D, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 234,320-324 (1997)]. In addition, various splice variants of each PDE4 isoform have been identified.<br>
PDE4 isoenzymes are localized in the cytosol of cells and are unassociated with any known membranous structures. PDE4 isoenzymes specifically inactivate cAMP by catalyzing its hydrolysis to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP). Regulation of cAMP activity is important in many biological processes, including inflammation and memory. Inhibitors of PDE4 isoenzymes such as rolipram, piclamilast, CDP-840 and ariflo are powerful anti-inflammatory agents and therefore may be useful in treating diseases where inflammation is problematic such as asthma or arthritis.   Further, rolipram improves the cognitive performance of rats and mice in learning paradigms.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
pentoxifylline, denbufylline, and theophylline inhibit PDE4 and have received attention of late for their cognition enhancing effects. cAMP and cGMP are second messengers that mediate cellular responses to many different hormones and neurotransmitters. Thus, therapeutically significant effects may result from PDE inhibition and the resulting increase in intracellular cAMP or cGMP in key cells, such as those located in the nervous system and elsewhere in the body.<br>
Rolipram, previously in development as an anti-depressant, selectively inhibits the PDE4 enzyme and has become a standard agent in the classification of PDE enzyme subtypes. Early work in the PDE4 field focused on depression and inflammation, and has subsequently been extended to include indications such as dementia, [see "The PDE IV Family Of Calcium-Phosphodiesterases Enzymes," John A. Lowe, III, et al., Drugs of the Future 1992, 17(9):799-807 for a general review]. Further clinical developments of rolipram and other first-generation PDE4 inhibitors were terminated due to the side effect profile of these compounds. The primary side effect in primates is emesis, while the primary side effects in rodents are testicular degranulation, weakening of vascular smooth muscle, psychotrophic effects, increased gastric acid secretion and stomach erosion. In humans, the primary side effect is nausea and emesis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds that inhibit, preferably selectively, PDE4 enzymes, and especially have improved side effect profiles, e.g., are relatively non-emetic (e.g., as compared to the previously discussed prior art compounds), hi particular, the present invention relates to novel rolipram analogs. The compounds of this invention at the same time facilitate entry into cells, especially cells of the nervous system.<br>
Still further, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing compounds with such activity and selectivity as well as methods of (and corresponding<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for) treating a patient, e.g., mammals, including humans, in need of PDE inhibition, especially PDE4 inhibition, for a disease state that involves elevated intracellular PDE 4 levels or decreased cAMP levels, e.g., involving neurological syndromes, especially those states associated with memory impairment, most especially long term memory impairment, as where such memory impairment is due at least in part to catabolism of intracellular cAMP levels by PDE 4 enzymes, or where such an impaired condition can be improved by increasing cAMP levels.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the compounds of the inventions improve such diseases by inhibiting PDE4 enzymes at doses that do not induce emesis or other side effects.<br>
Upon further study of the specification and appended claims, further aspects, objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

physiologically acceptable salts thereof, wherein in each case the compound can he in the form of a mixture of enantiomers such as the racemate, or a mixture of diastereomers, or can be in the form of a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer.<br>
Preferred aspects include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, another active agent as discussed below; a method of inhibiting a PDE4 enzyme, especially an isoenzyme, e.g., as determined by a conventional assay or one described herein, either in vitro or in vivo (in an animal, e.g., in an animal model, or in a mammal or in a human); a method of treating a neurological syndrome, e.g., loss of memory, especially long-term memory, cognitive impairment or decline, memory impairment, etc.; a method of treating a disease state modulated by PDE4 activity, in a mammal, e.g., a human, e.g., those disease states mentioned herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared conventionally. Some of the known processes that can be used are described below. All starting materials are known or can be conventionally prepared from known starting materials.<br>
Preparation of starting material (Scheme I)<br>
(Figure Remove)Enantiomerically pure rolipram, 4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone, and the starting material 4-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone were prepared as shown in scheme I and in a similar fashion as described previously (J. Demnitz, et.al., Enantiodivergent synthesis of (tf)-and (5)-Rolipram , Molecules, 1998, 3,107-119). Thus, appropriately substituted benzaldehydes were condensed with monomethyl<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
malonate to provide the corresponding methyl cinnamyl esters after decarboxylation. Conjugate addition of nitromethane using tetramethyl guanidine as base provided methyl 4-nitro-3-(substituted-phenyl)butyrate. Racemic4-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone was produced in 85% yield by selective reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding amine using NiCU and NaBH4 (Osby, J.O.; Ganem, B., Rapid and efficient reduction of aliphatic nitro compounds to amines, Tetrahedron Lett., 1985, 26, 6413-6416) and subsequent treatment with<br>
Methyl 4-nitro-3-(substituted-phenyl)butyrate was enantiomerically resolved by synthesizing diastereomeric phenethylamine amides as shown in scheme I. Nitro group reduction by catalytic hydrogenation as described by Demnitz, J. Molecules, 1998, 3, 1 07-1 1 9 was not successful. However, reduction of the diastereomerically pure nitro amides using NiCh and NaBKj produced 90% yield of the corresponding diastereomerically pure amines. Cyclization by warming to reflux in xylene yielded 51% of (S)-(+)-rolipram and 24% of (#)-(-)-rolipram, both in better than 99% ee as determined by chiral HPLC (Kusters, E.; Spondlin, C.; Influence of temperature on the enantioseparation of rolipram and structurally related racemates on Chiralcel-OD, J. Chromatogrampy A, 1996, 737, 333-337). Enantiomerically pure 3-benzyloxy derivatives 8 (R=benzyl) were produced in similar yield and purity after cyclization.<br>
3-Aryloxy rolipram derivatives were prepared by cross coupling reaction with aryl boronic acids using a copper catalyst in the presence of an amine base. Suitable copper catalysts include copper diacetate, copper (II) chloride, etc. Generally, halogenated solvents are utilized such as chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and the like. Commonly used bases include triethylamine, diisopropylamine, and pyrrolidine. Alternatively, 3-phenyloxyrolipram can be prepared by Ullman type coupling starting with iodobenzene and 3-hydroxyrolipram as described previously (Schmiechen, R.; Horowski, R.; Palenschat, D.; Paschelke, G.; Wachtel, H.; Kehr, W., 4-(polyalkoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidones., US Patent 4,193,926, filed Mar. 18, 1 980). Compounds substituted at the 3-position with arylalkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl groups can be prepared by either Mitsunobu reaction<br>
between phenol 9 (R1 = H) and alcohol or by an alkylaton reaction between phenol 9 (R1 = H) and R1X, where X is a suitable leaving group such as Cl, Br, methanesulphonyl,<br>
tosyloxy, etc.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
A series of enantiomerically pure W-substituted rolipram derivatives were synthesized by methods common to the art (Christensen, S.B., et.al, 1,4-Cyclohexanecarboxylates: Potent and selective inhibitors of Phosophodiesterase 4 for the treatment of asthma, J. Med. Chem., 1998, 41, 821-835.). Thus, the target compounds (Figure Remove) <br>
can be provided by alkylation reaction with alkyl halides, cycloalkyl halides, arylacyl chlorides, alpha bromoacetates, appropriately substituted alpha-bromides, and arylalkyl halides (i.e., benzylbromides) in polar aprotic solvents (i.e., DMF, THF, DMSO) using a non-nucleophilic base such as NaH or LDA, and a phase transfer catalyst such as 15-crown-5 ether.<br>
Reaction of methyl alpha-bromoacetate with a rolipram derivative as described above produces methyl N-acetates 12 (R = CHs), which can be saponified to the acid 12 (R=H) by treatment with a base, such as NaOH or KOH, and then converted to the acid chloride 13 by any number of reagents, such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Such acid chlorides undergo reaction with a number of nucleophiles including anilines to provide compounds of type 14.<br>
Alternatively, the acid 12 (R=H) undergoes coupling reactions with amines and a suitable coupling reagent such as DCC or HBTU in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or THF to produce amides of the type 14. In certain instances where R1 is a protecting group such as benzyl this group can be selectively removed from 14 to give the corresponding (R1 = H). This phenol can then be substituted by common methods in the art such as by reaction with cyclopentyl bromide in the presence of a suitable base or by a Mitsunobu reaction with 3(S)-hydroxy-tetrahydrofuran to generate desired target compounds.<br>

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that some of the compounds of Formula (I) can exist in different geometrical isomeric forms. In addition, some of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers, as well as in the form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof, and in the form of diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures inter alia. For example, in the pyrrolidone structure, the carbon atom at the 4-ring position will be chiral. All of these compounds, including cis isomers, trans isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, substantially pure, and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.<br>
In the compounds of formula I, when R3 is H, the 4(R) enantiomers are preferred, and when R3 is other than H, the 4(S)-enantiomers are preferred. When R1 is 3-tetrahydrofuran the 3(R) enantiomers are preferred over the 3(S) enantiomers.<br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of Formula I can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials in chiral syntheses processes under reaction conditions which do not cause racemization.<br>
In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the compounds can be used in different enriched isotopic forms, e.g., enriched in the content of 2H, 3H, UC, 13C and/or I4C. In one particular embodiment, the compounds are deuterated. Such deuterated forms can be made the procedure described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997. As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997, deuteration can improve the efficacy and increase the duration of action of drugs.<br>

CAPLUS.<br>
The present invention also relates to useful forms of the compounds as disclosed herein, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs of all the compounds of the present invention for which salts or prodrugs can be prepared. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those obtained by reacting the main compound, functioning as a base, with an inorganic or organic acid to form a salt, for example, salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include those in which the main compound functions as an acid and is reacted with an appropriate base to form, e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, and choline salts. Those skilled in the art will further recognize that acid addition salts of the claimed compounds may be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate inorganic or organic acid via any of a number of known methods. Alternatively, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts are prepared by reacting the compounds of the invention with the appropriate base via a variety of known methods.<br>
The following are further examples of acid salts that can be obtained by reaction with inorganic or organic acids: acetates, adipates, alginates, citrates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, butyrates, camphorates, digluconates, cyclopentanepropionates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, fumarates, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonates, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, nicotinates, 2-naphthalenesulfonates, oxalates, palmoates, pectinates, persulfates, 3-phenylpropionates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, succinates, taitrates, thiocyanates, tosylates, mesylates and undecanoates.<br><br>
Preferably, the salts formed are pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to mammals. However, pharmaceutically unacceptable salts of the compounds are suitable as intermediates, for example, for isolating the compound as a salt and then converting the salt back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent. The free base can then, if desired, be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered alone or as an active ingredient of a formulation. Thus, the present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula I, containing, for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
Numerous standard references are available that describe procedures for preparing various formulations suitable for administering the compounds according to the invention. Examples of potential formulations and preparations are contained, for example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (current edition); Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, 1 achman and Schwartz, editors) current edition, published by Marcel Dekker, Inc., as well as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Arthur Osol, editor), 1553-1593 (current edition).<br>
In view of their high degree of selective PDE4 inhibition, the compounds of the present invention can be administered to anyone requiring PDE4 inhibition. Administration may be accomplished according to patient needs, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (subcutaneously, intraveneously, intramuscularly, intrastemally and by infusion) by inhalation, rectally, vaginally, topically and by ocular administration.<br>
Various solid oral dosage forms can be used for administering compounds of the invention including such solid forms as tablets, gelcaps, capsules, caplets, granules, lozenges and bulk powders. The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents (such as sucrose, mannitol, lactose, starches) and excipients known in the art, including but not<br><br>

The present invention also includes methods for treating memory loss separate from dementias, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-related cognitive decline. The present invention includes methods of treatment for memory impairment as a result of disease including Huntington's disease and Down's syndrome. According to another aspect, the invention includes methods for treating memory loss from anesthetics, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and post-surgical trauma.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar or manic depression, major depression, and drug addiction. PDE4 inhibitors can be used to raise cAMP levels and prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis. PDE4 inhibitors are also known to be anti-inflammatory. The combination of preventing neuronal apoptosis and inhibiting inflammatory responses make these compounds useful to treat neurodegeneration resulting from any disease or injury, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyolaterosclerosis (ALS), and multiple systems atrophy (MSA).<br>

The compounds can also be used to treat psychosis characterized by elevated levels of PDE 4, for example, various forms of depression, such as manic depression, major depression, and depression associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders.<br>
The use of trisubstituted phenyl derivatives for treating asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, and other inflammatory diseases, and for inhibiting tumor necrosis factor is known within the art. See, e.g., WO 98/58901, JP11-18957, JP 10-072415, WO 93/25517, WO 94/14742, US 5,814,651, and US 5,935,978. These<br><br>
references describe 1,3,4-trisubstituted phenyl compounds said to exhibit PDE4 inhibition activity. They also describe assays for determining PDE4 inhibition activity, and methods for synthesizing such compounds. The entire disclosures of these documents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
PDE4 inhibitors may be used to prevent or ameliorate osteoporosis, as an antibiotic, for treatment of cardiovascular disease by mobilizing cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions, to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for long-term inhibition of mesenchymal-cell proliferation after transplantation, for treatment of urinary obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia, for suppression of chemotaxis and reduction of invasion of colon cancer cells, for treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), for inhibition of uterine contractions, to attenuate pulmonary vascular ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), for comeal hydration, for inhibition of IL-2R expression and thereby abolishing HIV-1 DNA nuclear import into memory T cells, for augmentation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, in both the prevention and treatment of colitis, and to inhibit mast cell degranulation.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents such as other agents used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and/or in the treatment of psychosis, e.g., other PDE4 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, chloinergic drugs, adenosine receptor modulators, amphakines NMDA-R modulators, mGluR modulators, and cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigimine, and glanthanamine). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below their usual dosage range.<br>
The dosages of the compounds of the present invention depend upon a variety of factors including the particular syndrome to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the route of administration, the frequency of the dosage interval, the particular compound utilized, the efficacy, toxicology profile, pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, and the presence of any deleterious side-effects, among other considerations.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention are typically administered at dosage levels and in a mammal customary for PDE4 inhibitors such as those known compounds mentioned above. For example, the compounds can be administered, in single or multiple doses, by oral administration at a dosage level of generally 0.001 -lOOmg/ky/day, for example, 0.01-100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1-70 mg/kg/day, especially 0.5-10 mg/kg/day.

To a mixture of 8.3 g (34.8 mmoi) of NiCl2-6H20 in 750 mL of MeOH was slowly added 14 g (104.5 mmol) of NaBHt. This mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 0 °C and a solution of 25 g of methyl 3-(3-benzyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-nitrobutanoate in 500 mL of MeOH was added. Then, 8.3 g (34.8 mmol) of NiCl2-6H2O was added to the reaction mixture, followed by the slow portion-wise addition of 9.2 g (243 mmol) of NaBH4. The mixture stirred at 0 °C for 1 hour and then 150 g of K2CO3 was added in one portion. The mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirring continued for 18 hours.    The suspension was filtered through a pad of celite, washed with 2 x 1000 mL of MeOH and concentrated. The residue was taken up in 2000 mL of EtOAc and the organic fraction was successively washed with 200 mL of H2O, 250 mL of brine, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to a solid. Trituration with hexanes/EtOAc provided 13 g of the desired product. An additional 2.3 g of product was obtained by extracting the aqueous fractions with EtOAc and combining this with the trituration solvent, concentrating and triturating with EtOAc/hexanes.

In Vitro Measurement of Type 4 Pbosphodiesterase<br>
Enzyme Preparation:<br>
Human PDE4 was obtained from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells that expressed the i ecombinant enzyme. The cDNA encoding hPDE-4D6 was subcloned into a baculovirus vector. Insect cells (Sf9) were infected with the baculovirus and cells were cultured until protein was expressed. The baculovirus-infected cells were lysed and the lysate was used as source of hPDE-4D6 enzyme. The enzyme was partially purified using a DEAE ion exchange chromatography. This procedure can be repeated using cDNA encoding other PDE-4 enzymes.<br>
Assay:<br>
Type 4 phosphodiesterases convert cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to 5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AMP). Nucleotidase converts 5'-AMP to adenosine. Therefore the combined activity of PDE4 and nucleotidase converts cAMP to adenosine.<br><br>
Adenosine is readily separated from cAMP by neutral alumina columns. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors block the conversion of cAMP to adenosine in this assay; consequently, PDE4 inhibitors cause a decrease in adenosine.<br>
Cell lysates (40 ul) expressing hPDE-4D6 were combined with 50 ul of assay mix and 10 ul of inhibitors and incubated for 12 min at room temperature. Final concentrations of assay components were: 0. 4 ug enzyme, lOmM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),<br>
1	OmM MgCl2, 3 uM cAMP, 0.002 U S'-nucleotidase, and 3 x 104 cpm of [3H]cAMP.<br>
The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ul of boiling 5mN HC1. An aliquot of 75 ul of<br>
reaction mixture was transferred from each well to alumina columns (Multiplate;<br>
Millipore). Labeled adenosine was eluted into an OptiPlate by spinning at 2000 rpm for<br>
2	min; 150 ^1 per well of scintillation fluid was added to the OptiPlate. The plate was<br>
sealed, shaken for about 30 min, and cpm of [3H]adenosine was determined using a<br>
Packard Topcount 96 counter.<br>
All test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted into the assay such that the final concentration of DMSO is 0.1%. DMSO does not affect enzyme activity at this concentration.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Passive Avoidance in Rats, an in vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Crissman, A.M., Dorairaj, N.R., Chandler, L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2000, 23, 198-204.). The apparatus (Model E10-16SC, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) consisted of a two-compartment chamber with an illuminated compartment connected to a darkened compartment by a guillotine door. The floor of the darkened compartment consisted of stainless steel rods through which an electric foot-shock could be delivered from a constant current source. All experimental groups were first habituated to the apparatus the day before the start of the experiment. During the training, the rat (Male Spraque-Dawley (Harlan) weighing 250 to 350 g) was placed in the illuminated compartment facing away from the closed guillotine door for 1 minute before the door was raised. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded. After the<br><br>
rat entered the darkened compartment, the door was closed and a 0.5 mA electric shock was administered for 3 seconds. Twenty-four hours later, the rat was administered 0.1 mg/kg of the test compound or saline, 30 minutes prior to the injection of saline or test compound (dosed from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), which was 30 minutes before the retention test started. The rat was again placed in the illuminated compartment with the guillotine door open. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded for up to 180 seconds, at which time the trial was terminated.<br>
All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual comparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests. Nai've rats required less than 30 seconds, on average, to cross from the illuminated compartment to the darkened compartment.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Radial arm maze task in Rats, an in vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Crissman, A.M., Dorairaj, N.R., Chandler, L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2000, 23, 198-204.). Five days after initial housing, rats (male Spraque-Dawley (Harlan) weighing 250 to 350 g) were placed in the eight-arm radial maze (each arm was 60x10x12 cm high; the maze was elevated 70 cm above the floor) for acclimation for two days. Rats were then placed individually in the center of the maze for 5 minutes with food pellets placed close to the food wells, and then, the next day, in the wells at the end of the arms; 2 sessions a day were conducted. Next, four randomly selected arms were then baited with one pellet of food each. The rat was restricted to the center platform (26 cm in diameter) for 15 seconds and then allowed to move freely throughout the maze until it collected all pellets of food or 10 minutes passed, whichever came first. Four parameters were recorded: 1) working memory errors, i.e., entries into baited arms that had already been visited during the same trial; 2) reference memory errors, i.e., entries into unbaited arms; 3) total arm entries; and 4) the test duration (seconds), i.e., the time spent in the collection of all the pellets in the maze. If the working memory error was<br><br>
zero and the average reference memory error was less than one in five successive trials, the rats began the drug tests. The test compound or saline was injected 15 minutes prior to vehicle or test agent, which was given 45 minutes before the test. Experiments were performed in a lighted room, which contained several extra-maze visual cues. All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual comparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests.<br>
A decrease in adenosine concentration is indicative of inhibition of PDE activity. This procedure was used to screen compounds of the present invention for their ability to inhibit PDE4. pICso values were determined by screening 6 to 12 concentrations of compound ranging from 0.1 nM to 10,000 nM and then plotting drug concentration versus 3H-adenosine concentration. Prism® was used to estimate pICso values.<br>
