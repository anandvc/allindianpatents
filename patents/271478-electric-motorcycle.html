ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE<br><br>
Technical field<br><br>
[0001]<br><br>
The present invention relates to an electric motorcycle driven by a power generating motor.<br><br>
 [Background Art] <br><br>
[0002]<br><br>
In the past, an electric motorcycle carrying a battery which supplies power source to drive a power generating motor for traveling is known.  In such an electric motorcycle, a pulley provided to a motor shaft of a power generating motor and a pulley provided to a rear wheel axle are coupled by a drive belt.  Driving force of the power generating motor is transmitted to the rear wheel axle via the drive belt (for example, see Patent document 1) <br><br>
[0003]<br><br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. H4-257783 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] <br><br>
[0004]<br><br>
However, in the above-mentioned conventional electric motorcycle, since the power generating motor is disposed separately from the rear wheel axle, the disposition space of the power generating motor is large.  Since the pulley provided to the motor shaft of the power generating motor, the pulley provided to the rear wheel axle, and the drive belt coupling each pulley are necessary, the number of components is large and power transmission efficiency is necessarily improved.<br><br>
In view of the situation mentioned above, the present invention is made to provide an electric motorcycle in which disposition space of a motor is downsized, the number of components is reduced, and power transmission efficiency is improved.<br><br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] <br><br>
[0005]<br><br>
For addressing the above problem, in an electric motorcycle of the present invention, a swing arm swingably supported by a vehicle body frame supports a power generating motor, a driving shaft of the power generating motor and a rear wheel axle of a rear wheel are coupled to transmit driving force of the power generating motor to the rear wheel.  The driving shaft of the power generating motor is disposed generally in parallel to the rear wheel axle of the rear wheel. A driving gear is provided on the driving shaft.  The driving gear is in meshing engagement with a reduction gear provided on the rear wheel axle.  The driving gear has a smaller diameter than that of the reduction gear.  The driving force of the power generating motor is transmitted to the rear wheel axle through a reduction.<br><br>
In the present invention, since the driving gear is a motor shaft of a power generating motor, a conventional pulley provided to a rear wheel   axle, and a conventional drive belt coupling each pulley are unnecessary, the number of components can be reduced, and power transmission efficiency can also be improved. <br><br>
[0006]<br><br>
In this case, a gear cover may be provided to cover a power transmission portion including the driving gear and the reduction gear.  The inside of the gear cover may be sealed.  The driving force transmission space may be filled with lubricating oil.<br>
Since the driving force transmission space is filled with lubricating oil, which is circulated in the power transmission portion including the driving gear and the reduction gear, the power transmission portion is driven smoothly. <br><br>
[0007]<br><br>
A device attachment space disposed to the outer side of the vehicle body and air introduction space disposed to the inner side of the vehicle body are formed by a partition wall inside the swing arm.  The power generating motor and a PDU for controlling the power generating motor are contained in the device attachment space.  A driving shaft of the power generating motor penetrates the partition wall from the device attachment apace to the air introduction space. The gear cover may define a driving force transmission space and an air introduction space. The PDU may be disposed forward of the generating motor in the vehicle body.  By directly coupling the driving gear and the reduction gear, marginal space is generated in the saving arm.  The PDU for controlling the power generating motor can be contained in this space, the power generating motor can be disposed close to the rear wheel axle, and disposition space of the power generating motor can be downsized.  Since the gear cover defines the driving force transmission space and the air introduction space, the inside of the driving force transmission space can be filled with lubricating oil. <br><br>
[0008]<br><br>
In planar view, the driving shaft may be disposed to the rear end of the swing arm and within the wheel width of the rear wheel in the fore-and-aft direction.<br><br>
The driving force can be efficiently transmitted using the minimum number of gears without increasing the number of driving gears because the driving shaft is disposed close to the rear wheel axle.  In addition, by driving the rear wheel via the driving gear to match a usage rotation zone of the power generating motor and a speed zone of the vehicle, it also becomes unnecessary to enlarge the power generating motor more than needed. <br><br>
[Effect of the Invention] <br><br>
[0009]<br><br>
 In the present invention, a driving shaft of power generating motor is disposed generally in parallel to a rear wheel axle of a rear wheel, a driving gear is provided on the driving shaft, the driving gear is in meshing engagement reduction gear provided on the rear wheel axle, the driving gear has a smaller diameter than that of the reduction gear, and driving force of the power generating motor is transmitted to the rear wheel axle. Accordingly, since the driving gear is directly coupled to the reduction gear, the power generating motor can be disposed close to the rear wheel axle, and the disposition space of the power generating motor can be downsized. Since a conventional pulley provided in a motor shaft of a power generating motor, a conventional pulley provided to a rear wheel axle, and a conventional drive belt connecting each belt pulley are unnecessary, the number of components can be reduced and power transmission efficiency can also be improved. <br><br>
[0010]<br><br>
Since a gear cover is provided to cover a power transmission portion including the driving gear and the reduction gear, the inside of the gear cover is sealed, and driving force transmission space is filled with lubricating oil, which is circulated in the power transmission portion including the driving gear and the reduction gear, the power transmission portion is driven smoothly. <br><br>
[0011]<br><br>
Further, by coupling the driving gear and the space of the power generating motor can be downsized. Since the gear cover defines a driving force transmission space and an air introduction space, the inside of the driving force transmission space can be filled with lubricating oil.<br><br>
[0012]<br><br>
Driving force can be efficiently transmitted using the minimum number of gears without increasing the number of driving gears because the driving shaft is disposed to the rear end of the swing arm and in the width of the rear wheel in the fore-and-aft direction in planar view and is disposed close to the rear wheel axle.  In addition, by driving the rear wheel via the driving gear to match the usage rotation zone of the power generating motor and the speed zone of the vehicle, it also becomes unnecessary to enlarge the power generating motor more than needed. <br><br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] <br><br>
[0013]<br><br>
An electric motorcycle of an embodiment of the present invention is explained below in reference to the drawings.  Vertical, fore-and-aft, and left-and-right directions described in the following explanation are ones seen from a driver.<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a battery-driven electric vehicle of an embodiment of the present invention. Fig.2 is a plane view of the electric vehicle. For ease of explanation, a seat rail 8, a fender cover 21, and a step floor 10 shown in Fig.1 are not shown in Fig.2.<br><br>
[0014]<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a front end of a vehicle body frame F of an electric motorcycle 1 includes: a head pipe 5 which steerably supports a front fork 2 journaling a front wheel WF; and a steering handlebar 3 coupled to the front fork 2.  The vehicle body frame F includes a center frame 6, a rear frame 7, and a seat rail 8.  As shown in Fig. 2, the frames 6, 7, and 8 are each structured symmetrically in pairs in the vehicle body width direction.<br><br>
[0015]<br><br>
The center frame 6 includes an inclined portion 6a coupled to the above head pipe 5 and extending toward the rear of the vehicle body obliquely downward and horizontal portions 6b curving at the lower end of the inclined portion 6a and extending generally horizontally toward the rear of the vehicle body.  As shown in Fig. 2, the center frame 6 is coupled by a cross member 6c for coupling the left and right horizontal portions 6b in the vehicle width direction.<br><br>
The rear frame 7 includes: first inclined portions 7a extending obliquely upward from the rear ends of the horizontal portions 6b of the center frame 6 toward the rear of the vehicle body; and second inclined portions 7c extending obliquely upward from curving portions 7b curving at the rear ends of the first inclined portions 7a toward the rear of the vehicle body at a smaller inclination than that of the first inclined portions 7a. As shown in Fig.2 the right and left second inclined portions 7c are coupled by a cross frame 7d extending in the vehicle body which direction.<br><br>
Further, the seat rail 8 has a generally inverted U-shape attached above the rear frame 7, and includes: inclined portions 8a extending obliquely upward from the curving portions 7b of the rear frame 7 toward the forward of the vehicle body; horizontal portions 8b extending rearward from the upper ends of the inclined portions 8a; and support portions 8c extending rearward and obliquely downward from the rear portions of the horizontal portions 8b toward the second inclined portions 7c. <br>
[0016]<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 1, 2, in the horizontal portions 6b of the center frame 6, batteries 9, mentioned later in details, are contained in a battery box 19.  The battery box 19 is attached to be sandwiched by a pair of left and right frames of the horizontal portions 6b.  In the side view shown in Fig. 1, the bottom surface of the battery box 19 is disposed below the horizontal portions 6b.  The center portion of the cross member 6c of the center frame 6 in the vehicle body width direction is depressed downward. The battery box 19 is fixed to be mounted on this cross member 6c. <br><br>
[0017]<br><br>
 The portion to which this battery box 19 is disposed is below a so-called foot rest space S. The upper side of the battery box 19 is covered with a step floor 10 for resting of a rider.<br><br>
[0018]<br><br>
The battery box 19 is formed to have a generally rectangular box shape, containing the batteries 9.  In the battery box 19, the batteries 9 are arranged laterally. Air introduction ducts 2(3 for introducing the open air into the battery box 19 are laterally provided to the front surface of the battery box 19.  On the other hand, an outlet 20b for discharging the introduced air is formed to the rear surface of the battery box 19.<br>
Accordingly, the batteries 9 are cooled by the air introduced from an inlet 20a, and the air after the cooling can be discharged from the outlet 20b. <br><br>
[0019]<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 1, pivot plates 11 projecting toward the rear of the vehicle body are respectively provided to the left and right of the rear frame 7 near the coupling portion between the rear frame 7 and the center frame 6 and below the curving portions 7b.  A pivot shaft 12 is provided penetrating the left and right pivot plates 11 in the vehicle width direction.  The front end of a swing arm 13 is attached to the pivot shaft 12.  The swing arm 13 pivots vertically about the pivot shaft 12. <br><br>
[0020]<br><br>
The swing arm 13 is coupled to the second inclined portion 7c of the rear frame 7 via a rear suspension 14 disposed to the left in the vehicle body width direction. For more details, an upper end 14a of the rear suspension 14 is attached to the second inclined portion 7c of the rear frame 7, and a lower end portion 14b of the rear suspension lA   is attached to the rear portion of the swing arm 13.  Accordingly, vertical vibration of the rear wheel WR supported by the rear end of the swing arm 13 is absorbed by the rear suspension 14. <br><br>
[0021]<br><br>
A pair of pivot support portions 13b pivotally attached to the pivot shaft 12 are provided to the front end of the swing arm 13 while separating laterally in the vehicle body width direction.  While the swing arm 13 is attached to the pivot shaft 12, the swing arm 13 extends to the rearward of the vehicle body along the left of the rear wheel WR after extending from the pivot shaft 12 (pivot support portions 13b) obliquely toward the rear of the vehicle body and obliquely left to avoid the rear wheel WR. A rear wheel axle 17 extending in the vehicle body width direction is provided to the rear portion of this swing arm 13.  The rear wheel WR is rotatably cantilevered by the rear wheel axle 17. <br><br>
[0022]<br><br>
Figs. 1, 2 show a headlight 41 for illuminating the forward of the vehicle body, an occupant seat 42 attached to the horizontal portions 8b of the seat rail 8, a brake light 43 attached to the rear end of the rear frame 7, and a reflector 44 disposed below the brake light 43.<br><br>
[0023]<br><br>
Fig.3 is a cross sectional view taken along III-III of Fig.1, showing the swing arm 13 alone. Fig.4 is a left side view (in the direction of A of Fig.3), showing the state where a left cover (outside cover) 26 shown in Fig. 3 has been removed.  Further, Fig. 5 is a view of Fig. 3 seen from the forward of the vehicle body (from the direction of B of Fig. 3).<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the swing arm 13 is structured by assembling a body 25 having a partition wall 25a extending in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle body, the left cover 26 covering the left side of the body 25, and a right cover 27 covering the right side of the body 25.<br><br>
[0024]<br><br>
Two spaces, a device attachment space 23 disposed to the left of the vehicle body (the outer side of the vehicle body) and an air introduction space 24 disposed to the right of the vehicle body (the inner side of the vehicle body), are formed inside the swing arm 13.  The spaces 23, 24 are respectively defined left and right in the vehicle body width direction by the above-described partition wall 25a, and structured extending in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle body.<br><br>
The left side of the device attachment space 23 is closed by removably attaching the above described left cover 26 by use of bolts etc.  Similarly, the right side of the air introduction space 24 is closed by removably attaching the above described right cover 27 by use of bolts etc.<br><br>
[0025]<br><br>
A power generating motor 16 for driving the rear wheel WR and a PDU 18 (Power Drive Unit) for controlling the power generating motor 16 are contained in the device attachment space 23.  The maintenance of the power generating motor 16 and the PDU 18 is possible by removing the left cover 26. <br><br>
[0026]<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the power generating motor 16 is disposed to the rear portion of the swing arm 13, and is removably attached to a power generating motor attachment portion 33 formed to the partition wall 25a.  In planar view, a driving shaft 16a of the power generating motor 16 is disposed to the rear end of the swing arm 13 and in a width of a wheel of the rear wheel WR in the fore-and-aft direction.  The driving shaft 16a is disposed generally in parallel to the rear wheel axle 17 of the rear wheel WR, and penetrates the partition wall 25a and projects from the device attachment space 23 to the air introduction space 24. A driving gear 29 is formed on the driving shaft 16a, and is in meshing engagement with a reduction gear 30 provided on the rear wheel axle 17.  The driving gear 29 has a smaller diameter than that of the reduction gear 30, and transmits driving force of the power generating motor 16 to the rear wheel axle 17 through a single stage reduction.<br><br>
That is, since the driving gear 29 is directly coupled to the reduction gear 30, the power generating motor  16 can be disposed close to the rear wheel axle 17, and the disposition space of the power generating motor 16 can be downsized. By coupling the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30 directly, marginal space is produced in the swing arm 13, and the PDU 18 for controlling the power generating motor 16 can be contained in this space. Further, since a conventional pulley provided to a motor shaft of a power generating motor, a conventional pulley provided to a rear axle, and a conventional drive belt coupling each pulley are unnecessary, the number of components can be reduced, and power transmission efficiency can be also improved.<br><br>
Since the driving shaft 16a is disposed close to the rear wheel axle 17, driving force can be efficiently transmitted using the minimum number of gears without increasing the number of driving gears.  Additionally, to match a usage rotation zone of the power generating motor 16 and a speed zone of the vehicle, the rear wheel WR is driven via the driving gear 29.  Accordingly, the power generating motor 16 does not need to be enlarged beyond necessity. <br><br>
[0027]<br><br>
A gear cover 34 is attached to the body 25 to cover a power transmission portion including the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30.  The gear cover 34 defines a driving force transmission space 31 in which the power transmission portion is disposed and the air introduction space 24. The driving force transmission space 31 is sealed to permit the driving force transmission space 31 to hold lubricating oil. As described above, since the sealed driving force transmission space 31 is filled with lubricating oil, which is circulated in the power transmission portion including the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30, the power transmission portion is driven smoothly.<br><br>
A pin member 36 for activating a drum brake unit 35 is provided to the gear cover 34.  The drum brake unit 35 operates by operating a brake handle 39 attached to a steering handlebar 3 on the left.  For more details, a brake lever 38 pivots by operation of the brake handle 39 via a brake wire 37 shown in Fig. 4, and the brake of the rear wheel WR operates by operating the pin member 36 attached to the brake lever 38. <br><br>
[0028]<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 2, 3, the PDU 18 is disposed forward of the power generating motor 16, and is removably attached, by use of bolts etc., to a PDU attachment surface 32 formed to the partition wall 25a.  A drive circuit, a capacitor, a heat sink, etc., which are not shown, are contained in the PDU 18.<br><br>
The PDU 18 is connected to the batteries 9 by wiring, which is not shown, and electric power is sent to the PDU 18 from the batteries 9.  The PDU 18 is also connected, by wiring, to an ECU (Electric Control Unit), which contains a control program etc. but is not shown, and a control signal is sent to the PDU 18 from the ECU. Further, the PDU 18 is also connected to the power generating motor 16 by wiring, which is not shown, the electric power and a control signal are sent to the power generating motor 16 from the PDU 18. The ECU mentioned above is attached to the vehicle body.<br><br>
[0029]<br><br>
The drive circuit etc. of the PDU 18 generate a larger amount of heat as compared with other components. Therefore, the PDU 18 adheres to as a large area of the PDU attachment surface 32 of the partition wall 25a as possible. Heat generated from, e.g., the drive circuit is thermally conducted to the partition wall 25a, and released. <br><br>
[0030]<br><br>
On the other hand, multiple cooling fins 40 project from the partition wall 25a in the air introduction space 24, and heat thermally conducted from the PDU 18 to the partition wall 25a is further thermally conducted to the cooling fins 40. <br><br>
[0031]<br><br>
A front opening 13a is formed to the front end of the air introduction space 24.  A cooling fan 22 for sending air into the air introduction space 24 is attached to the front opening 13a.  The cooling fan 22 is disposed between the above battery box 19 and the PDU 18 in the side view shown in Fig. 1, and has a function for drawing the air in the battery box 19 from an outlet 20b.  In other words, the outlet 20b of the battery box 19 and the front opening 13a of the swing arm 13 generally match one another in width direction and in the height direction of the vechicle body, and are opposed to one another. The air discharges from the outlet 20b is efficiently introduced into the front opening 13a by the cooling fan 22.<br><br>
[0032]<br><br>
An air hole through which the air introduction space 24 and the device attachment space 23 are in communication with one another is formed to a portion of the partition wall 25a to which the power generating motor 16 is attached. Accordingly, the air introduced from the front opening 13a flows into the power generating motor 16 from the above mentioned air hole after passing through the air introduction space 24, and is discharged to the atmosphere after cooling the inside of the power generating motor 16 by air. <br><br>
[0033]<br><br>
The power generating motors 16, the PDU 18, and the cooling fan 22 pivot vertically in response to pivots of the swing arm 13 together with the rear wheel WR.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a pair of attachment portions 46 for supporting a main stand 45 are formed below the swing arm 13, the pair being separate from one another left and right in the vehicle body width direction.  Thus, the main stand 45 is attached to the swing arm 13 by an attachment pin 4 6b (see Fig. 1) inserted into attachment holes 4 6a of the attachment portions 46, and pivots together with the swing arm 13. <br><br>
[0034]<br><br>
 Fig.6 is a side view of the body 25 of the swing arm 13 seen from the left (from the device attachment space 23) Fig.7 is a side view of the body 25 seen from the right (from the air introduction space 24). Fig. 8 is a front view of the left cover 26 seen from the body 25. Fig.9 is a front view of the right cover 27 seen from the body 25. Fig. 10 is a side view of the gear cover 34 seen from the left (from the driving force transmission space 31) .  Fig. 11 is a side view of the gear cover 34 from the right. <br><br>
[0035]<br><br>
The body 25 is molded by casting using aluminum material excellent in thermal conductivity, and as shown in Figs. 6, 7, integrally formed from the above mentioned partition wall 25a and an upper surface portion 25b and a lower surface portion 25c vertically sandwiching the partition wall 25a.<br><br>
The partition wall 25a extends along a shape of the swing arm 13 in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction. As shown in Fig. 6, the PDU attachment surface 32 and the power generating motor attachment portion 33 are formed to the device attachment space 23.  The PDU attachment surface 32 is disposed to a portion where the swing arm 13 extends obliquely from the vehicle body center portion toward the side {see Figs. 2, 3).  The PDU attachment surface 32 is also formed to incline obliquely from the vehicle body center to the side from the front to rear of the vehicle body.  The PDU attachment surface 32 and the fixing surface of the PDU 18 are each formed from a generally plane surface. The fixing surface of PDU 18 and the PDU attachment surface 32 adhere to one another, and the adhesion surface is made large to increase thermal conductivity. PDU attachment holes 51 for fixing the PDU 18 with screws etc. are formed to four corners of the PDU attachment surface 32, respectively.<br><br>
[0036]<br><br>

[0048]<br><br>
As explained above, the electric motorcycle 1 of the embodiment of the present invention is as follows.  The driving shaft 16a of the power generating motor 16 is disposed generally in parallel to the rear wheel axle 17 of the rear wheel WR.  The driving gear 29 is provided on the driving shaft 16a, and in meshing engagement with the reduction gear 30 provided on the rear wheel axle 17.  The driving gear 29 has a smaller diameter than that of the reduction gear 30.  Driving force of the power generating motor 16 is transmitted to the rear wheel axle 17 through a reduction to directly couple the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30.  Accordingly, the power generating motor 16 can be disposed close to the rear wheel axle 17, and the disposition space of the power generating motor 16 can be downsized.  Since a conventional pulley provided to a power generating motor, a conventional pulley provided to a rear wheel axle, and a conventional drive belt coupling each pulley are unnecessary, the number of components can be reduced, and power transmission efficiency can also be improved.<br><br>
[0049]<br><br>
The gear cover 34 is provided to cover the power transmission portion including the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30. The inside of the gear cover 34 is sealed, and the driving force transmission space 31 is filled with lubricating oil, which is circulated in the power transmission portion including the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30.  Accordingly, the power transmission portion is driven smoothly. <br><br>
[0050]<br><br>
Further, the driving gear 29 and the reduction gear 30 are coupled directly to produce marginal space in the swing arm 13.  The PDU 18 for controlling the power generating motor 16 can be contained in the marginal space. The power generating motor 16 is disposed close to the rear wheel axle 17, and the disposition space of the power generating motor 16 can be downsized.  Since the gear cover 34 defines the driving force transmission space 31 and the air introduction space 24, the inside of the driving force transmission space 31 can be filled with the lubricating oil . <br><br>
[0051]<br><br>
Since the driving shaft 16a is disposed, in planar view, to the rear end of the swing arm 13 and within the width of the rear wheel WR in the fore-and-aft direction, the driving shaft 16a is disposed close to the rear wheel axle 17.  Without increasing the number of gears, driving force can be transmitted efficiently by use of the minimum number of gears. In addition, the rear wheel WR is driven via the driving gear 29 to match the usage rotation zone of the power generating motor 16 and the speed zone of the vehicle. It is not necessary to enlarge the power generating motor 16 beyond necessity.<br><br>
