CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 09/649,635 filed August 28,<br>
2000 entitled, "Deformable Iv.olds And Methods For Their Use In The Manufacture<br>
Of Ophthalmic Lenses", and ihis application claims priority from provisional<br>
application, Serial No. 60/263,986, filed January 24,2001, both applications are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of ophthalmic products. In<br>
particular, the invention provides molds for forming ophthalmic products, and<br>
methods for forming the molds and ophthalmic products using the molds.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses, including spectacle lenses, contact lenses,<br>
intraocular lenses, and the likt for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
Production of the lenses requi res the use of molds that impart the desired corrective<br>
characteristics onto the lens sixfaces. Typically, a large inventory of molds is<br>
required corresponding to eac.i sphere, add, and cylinder power, and combinations<br>
thereof desired for the finished lens. Production and maintenance costs for the mold<br>
inventory are high.<br>
One current method of forming contact lenses is actually by a process that<br>
has two molding steps. In the first molding step, male and female metal inserts,<br>
fabricated by such methods as diamond point turning to ensure a very smooth<br>
surface, are used to injection riold an ophthalmic lens mold comprising a pair of<br>
mold members, typically male and female plastic molds, also referred to as back<br><br>
curve and front curve lens molds. Then, in the second molding step, the contact lens<br>
forming material is dosed between the back curve and front curve lens molds and the<br>
contact lens is molded between the plastic: back and front curve. Typically the back<br>
and front curves are not reused The production of an ophthalmic lens mold<br>
typically comprising mold menbers in which a lens forming material is molded to<br>
form an ophthalmic product, is the subject of the present invention.<br>
The injection molding step just described to form the ophthalmic lens mold<br>
members limits the types of materials that can be used to form the lens molds.<br>
One method for production of lenses that attempts to eliminate the need for<br>
large inventory molds is discibsed in United States Patent No. 6,026,204. In this<br>
patent is disclosed the use of customized, heated dies, which utilize mechanical<br>
fingers, alone or in combination with a metal surface, to impart the desired<br>
corrective characteristics to a lens blank. This method is disadvantageous in that it<br>
is unsuitable for the production of certain ophthalmic lenses, such as soft contact<br>
lenses because soft contact lens materials are thermoset that cannot be deformed<br>
with heat. Additionally, this method is disadvantageous in that molding the lens<br>
material using a heated die r squires that the lens blanks' optical axis be perfectly<br>
aligned with that of the die, which adds a great degree of difficulty to production of<br>
the lens. Therefore, a need srists for n method to produce ophthalmic lenses with a<br>
mold that permits reduction of lens inventory and which overcomes some or all of<br>
these disadvantages.<br>
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) were developed about 20 years ago and<br>
have been the subject of commercial development in the last 10 years. SMPs derive<br>
their name from their inherent ability to return to their original "memorized" shape<br>
after undergoing a shape deformation. SMPs that have been preformed can be<br>
deformed to any desired si ape below or above their glass transition temperatures<br>
(Tg). If it is below the Tg, this process is called cold deformation. When<br><br>
deformation of aplastic occurs above its Tg, the process is denoted as warm<br>
deformation. In either case the SMP must remain below, or be quenched to below,<br>
its Tg, while maintained in the desired thermoformed shape to "lock" in the<br>
deformation. Once the defonnation is locked in, the polymer network cannot return<br>
to a relaxed state due to thermal barriers. The SMP will hold its deformed shape<br>
radefinitely until it is heated above its Tg, whereat the SMP stored mechanical strain<br>
is released and the SMP returns to its preformed state.<br>
Several polymer type s exhibit shape memory properties. Probably the best<br>
known and best researched polymer type exhibiting shape memory properties is<br>
polyurethane polymers. Goidon. Proc of First Intl. Conf. Shape Memory and<br>
Superelastic Tech.. 115-120 (1994) and Tobushi et al., Proc of First Intl. Conf.<br>
Shape Memory and Supereh.stic Tech.. 109-114 (1994) exemplify studies directed<br>
to properties and application of shape memory polyurethanes. Another known<br>
polymeric system, disclosed by Kagami et al., Macromol. Rapid Communication.<br>
17, 539-543 (1996), is a class of copolymers of stearyl acrylate and acrylic acid or<br>
methyl acrylate. Other SMP polymers; known in the art include articles formed of<br>
norbornene or dimethaneoct;mydronaphthalene homopolymers or copolymers, set<br>
forth in U.S. Patent 4,83 LO94, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an ophthalmic mold comprising a<br>
shape memory polymer (SMP) or shape memory alloy (SMA) is provided. The<br>
mold preferably comprises at least two mold members, preferably two mold<br>
members, of which at least one mold member comprises a SMP or SMA. The mold<br>
preferably comprises a front curve and a back curve, and is preferably used to form a<br>
contact lens; however, the ophthalmic products that may be formed using the<br>
ophthalmic molds of this invention include spectacle lenses, contact lenses,<br>
interocular lenses or the like<br><br>
Additionally, this invention provides a molding surface of an agile tool or as<br>
referred to in U.S. Serial No. 09/ 649,635, a deformable mold comprising a SMP or<br>
SMA; however, the focus of the description will be the formation of an ophthalmic<br>
mold comprising an SMP or SMA.; however, the teachings herein can be applied to<br>
the molding surface of the agile tool.<br>
The mold of this invention comprising an SMP or SMA can be used to make<br>
a lens and then re-shaped and reused to form another lens, thereby reducing the<br>
amount of mold material consumed in a lens manufacturing facility. Additionally in<br>
alternative embodiments, the molds formed by the methods described below can be<br>
used to produce more varied contact lenses and even customized contact lenses at a<br>
lower cost than if metal inserts had to be fabricated to make each mold member.<br>
Additionally, by using the mold of this invention in manufacturing ophthalmic<br>
products, a mechanical demol 1 step, used in the prior art to remove an ophthalmic<br>
product molded within the mcld, may be eliminated and replaced with the step of<br>
heating the mold comprising a SMP or SMA above its Tg to cause the mold to<br>
deform, at which time the ophthalmic product can be removed from the mold<br>
without the mechanical demo ld step.<br>
Further, the molds of this invention are not formed by injection molding at<br>
high temperature, i.e. as high as 300°C, and elevated pressure, thereby providing<br>
new types of materials that can be used to make the devices, that shape the<br>
ophtfialmic molds. By fonnng molds by methods other than injection-molding,<br>
different mold forming materials, and methods can be used to make the molds.<br>
Additionally, if the agile toe ls described herein are used to make the molds a full<br>
prescriptive range of lenses can be produced while reducing the number of molds<br>
required, and eliminating all the injection-molding tools required to do the same.<br>
Further, the molds of the in vention may be used in a method for the delivery of<br>
customized ophthalmic lenses to a lens wearer.<br><br>

114. The mold 110 is shown with the first and second mold members 112,114<br>
assembled to form a cavity 11:5 into which a lens forming material is preferably<br>
dosed prior to assembly of the mold members. After assembly of the mold members<br>
to form the mold 110, the lens forming material is preferably cured or crosslinked to<br>
form an ophthalmic product. 5 urface 116 of the first mold member 112 and surface<br>
115 of the second mold member 114 are optically critical surfaces (also referred to<br>
herein as the optical forming surfaces) of the mold, because they are the surfaces of<br>
the mold that contact the lens farming material, and those surfaces 115,116 impart<br>
the optical characteristics to the ophthalmic product formed within the mold 110.<br>
By "optical characteristics" is neant one or more spherical, aspheric, toric,<br>
cylindrical curvature, or other wavefront corrections, and the like and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
The first and second meld members 112,114 are shown comprising optional<br>
flanges 118, 117. As shown, the mold 110 is suitable for making a contact lens. For<br>
the formation of contact lenses the first mold member 112 may be referred to as the<br>
front curve lens mold or front c irve, and the second mold member 114 as the back<br>
curve or back curve lens mold, md the mold 110 may be referred to as a lens<br>
assembly. In the prior art the fnnt curves: and back curves are often made by<br>
injection molding, as described in the "Background of the Invention."<br>
This invention will be described with reference to the preferred embodiment<br>
used in the formation of contact lenses; however, it is understood that the molds of<br>
this invention can be used to make other ophthalmic products.<br>
The fabrication of the molds comprising a shape memory polymer is<br>
accomplished by methods that fcike advantage of the unique properties of these<br>
polymers. In one preferred embodiment the shape memory polymer contact lens<br>
mold is prepared in a hot forming method in which a sheet, preferably disc-shaped,<br>
however various shapes can be used, of a shape memory polymer is formed into the<br><br>
desired contact lens mold shap s, corresponding to the desired contact lens to be<br>
formed using the mold, by means of a press. The term "press" is used to describe a<br>
device used to shape the SMP. The press comprises at least one surface that<br>
contacts the SMP.<br>
One embodiment of the press used in the present invention is as shown in<br>
Figures 2 and 3 constitutes a second mold member forming press or second press 1<br>
and a first mold member forming press or first press 7. The second press 1 includes<br>
a base curve element 2 and a cc re element 4. The first press 7 includes a front curve<br>
element 6 and a core element 8C  The base curve element 2 and front curve element 6<br>
may be formed by diamond point turning and/or polishing of an appropriate metal,<br>
e.g. brass. Alternatively, the mJtal may be metal plated, e.g. nickel plated.<br>
Preferably, the smoothness of the base curve element 2 and front curve element 6 is<br>
such that the surface roughness of these elements is no more than a root mean square<br>
roughness (RMS) of about 20 nanometers. It is emphasized that the base curve<br>
element 2 and front curve element 6 of the press 1,7 define the surfaces 115,116 of<br>
the second and first mold memt ers 114,112, respectively, that are the optically<br>
critical surfaces of the mold because those surfaces of the mold contact the lens<br>
forming material molded into tie lens. Although smooth surfaces 3 and 5 of the<br>
base curve elements 2 and front curve element 6, respectively, are depicted as<br>
spherical, they may be toric shaped, bifocal shaped, shaped to correct for wavefront<br>
aberrations, or another shape rel leering other contact lens designs.<br>
The core elements 4,8 of the second and first mold forming presses 1,7 are<br>
depicted in the drawings as solids. The cere elements 4,8 are preferably made of<br>
elastomers, or metals, or a combination of these materials. The core elements 4,8<br>
may comprise the same metals tsed to make the front curve element 6 and base<br>
curve element 2. The surface oi the core elements 4,8 typically are not subject to<br>
any smoothness requirement.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the core element is not a solid element, but is<br>
provided by gas pressure or the like. In a preferred embodiment the gas is air, with<br>
the proviso that the gas is inert insofar as it does not react with the SMP material.<br>
Alternatively, a vacuum may be pulled OE. the base curve element 2 or front curve<br>
element 6 sides of the presses tc pull the sihape memory polymer sheet against the<br>
base curve element or front curve element The key is the pressure differential<br>
across the sheet pushing or pullmg the sheet against the base curve element or front<br>
curve element.<br>
In operation, for example in reference to the second mold member forming<br>
press 1, a shape memory polyner- or alloy sheet 12 is formed into a second mold<br>
member while being held by a shape memory polymer or alloy holder 10, (shown in<br>
Figures 4 and 5) between the core element 4 and the base curve element 2 having<br>
smooth surface 3. The SMP sheet is preferably a flat sheet, and shown as round;<br>
however other shapes may be used. The SMP sheet 12 is inserted into holder 10 as<br>
shown in Figures 4 and 5. The iiolder 10 is accommodated in an alignment jig 15<br>
shown in Figure 6. Holder 10 effectively holds the SMP sheet 12 at its edges 33 so<br>
that the edges 33 of the SMP shset 12 form the flange 117 of the mold member 114.<br>
The holder 10 maintains the edges 33 of tie SMP sheet in fixed position while the<br>
center portion 34 of the sheet 12 is shaped in the form of a mold member 114. The<br>
holder 10 holds SMP sheet 12 without restricting the deformation of the center<br>
portion 34 of the sheet 12. Nex;, the base curve element 2 and core element 4 are<br>
introduced into the alignment jig 15 discussed below. Prior to any contact with the<br>
SMP sheet, the temperature of the SMP sheet is raised to or above the glass<br>
transition temperature of the SMP. The SMP may be heated to a temperature above<br>
its glass transition temperature by exposing the SMP sheet to radiation, such as IR<br>
radiation, a hot gas, or by conduction (heating the holder). The SMP temperature<br>
preferably should be heated to and maintained within a few degrees above the glass<br>
transition temperature because further heating will likely not change the modulus<br>
(stiffness) of the material and would only increase the heating time and energy<br><br>
requirements. After heating ths SMP, the base curve element 2 is pressed into core<br>
element 4 under appropriate pressure. After a short period of time, the temperature<br>
of the press 1 is thereupon reduced to below the SMP glass transition temperature<br>
for a sufficient time period for the SMP to drop to a temperature below its glass<br>
transition temperature. The sample may be cooled by, for example, removing the<br>
heating source only, removing the heating source and exposing the sample to a cool<br>
gas stream, or by removing the heating ;source and running a cooling fluid through<br>
the base curve element 2. The JIMP temperature should be reduced to a few degrees<br>
below the glass transition temp erature. Further cooling will likely only increase the<br>
cooling time. At this time, the holder 10 is removed from the jig 15, and the<br>
deformed SMP sheet 12, in the form of a second mold member 114, is removed<br>
from the holder 10.<br>
A similar procedure takes place in. forming the first mold member 112. That<br>
mold member is identically pre Dared except that the diamond point turned, polished<br>
or nickel plated coated surface 5 of the front curve element 6 cooperates with a core<br>
element 8 of the front curve forming press 7 to form a first mold member 112 having<br>
an optically critical surface 116 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The above mold forming process ;.s best accomplished employing an<br>
alignment jig 15. Alignment jig 5 15 includes a top element 22, and a bottom element<br>
23 defining a groove opening 24 therebetween. Top and bottom elements 22 and 23<br>
have an aligned opening 25. The holder 10 is accommodated in the groove opening<br>
24. Holder 10 includes an opening 11 which is aligned in alignment jig 15 so that<br>
openings 11 and 25 are in regisier. The press elements fit into opening 11 and 25 so<br>
that the press elements are aligned with respect to each other and with respect to the<br>
SMP holder 10. The second meld member is shown being formed in press 1 within<br>
jig 15 in Figure 7. The first mo d member is shown being formed in press 7 within<br>
jig 15 in Figure 8.<br><br>
The elements of the presses and ihe elements of any of the other<br>
embodiments described below for forming the mold of this invention, may be<br>
brought into contact for purposes of forming the mold using any suitable contacting<br>
means including, without limitation, stepper motors, screw drives, or the like, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Another method of fabricating an ophthalmic mold comprising a shape<br>
memory polymer is by use of an agile deformable mold, as described in the parent<br>
application U.S. Serial No. 09/549,635. To avoid confusion between the mold that<br>
is being claimed herein and the agile mold described in the parent application and<br>
further described here, the agile mold will be referred to herein as an "agile tool".<br>
The agile tool preferably is use i to make an ophthalmic mold or an ophthalmic mold<br>
member, which is then used to make an ophthalmic product. The agile tool<br>
comprises a molding surface th it is capable of being deformed. The molding<br>
surface of the agile tool is defoimed by adjustment means.<br>
One type of agile tool useful in making the molds of this invention comprises<br>
a layer which may be composite of materials or layers of which the non-molding<br>
side of the layer or non-molding surface of the agile tool is contacted with the<br>
adjustment means and the molding side of the layer or molding surface of the agile<br>
tool contacts the SMP that forms the ophthalmic mold. At least a portion of the<br>
molding surface of the agile tool is capable of being deformed and has a first shape<br>
that may be of any shape, but cc nveniently is of a concave or convex shape having a<br>
first radius of curvature R1. This deformable portion of the molding surface of the<br>
agile tool is capable of being de :brmed by action of the adjustment means preferably<br>
against the non-molding surface of the agile tool so that the deformable portion<br>
assumes a second shape that is desired to be imparted to at least a portion of a<br>
surface of the ophthalmic mold 10 be produced in the agile tool. The second shape<br>
of the molding surface of the agile tool imparts the desired optical characteristics to<br>
the mold.<br><br>
As stated earlier, "optical characteristics" is meant one or more of spherical,<br>
aspheric, tone, or cylindric cmvature, or other wavefront aberrations and the like<br>
and combinations thereof. Theoptical characteristic imparted will depend on the<br>
aberrations of the lens wearer's eye desired to be corrected. The agile tool is<br>
suitable for producing molds to produce ophthalmic products for correction of any<br>
wavefront aberration of the eye, meaning any departure from a spherical wavefront.<br>
These aberrations include, witiout limitation, astigmatism, defocus, coma, spherical<br>
aberrations, distortion, and the like. These aberrations also may be defined using<br>
Zemike polynomials.<br>
The layer and/or at least the molding surface of the agile tool may be formed<br>
by any material capable of being deformed, capable of withstanding the stresses<br>
imposed by the SMP or SMA mold manufacturing process, and capable when<br>
deformed of mamtaining a shape suitable for imparting the desired optical<br>
characteristics to the mold to be formed using the agile tool. The surface of the agile<br>
tool must be deformable and non-reactive with the SMP or SMA used to form the<br>
mold member in the agile too.. Suitable agile tool layer or molding surface<br>
materials include, without limitation, metals, polymers, metalized polymers and the<br>
like and combinations thereof Exemplary of these materials are aluminum, gold,<br>
brass, and nickel metals, poly Dlefin polymers including, without limitation,<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, polyethylene terphthalate, silicone polymers,<br>
electro-active polymers such is polyarchies, polypyrroles, ion exchange polymer<br>
metal matrix compositions and the like, shape-memory polymers such as segmented<br>
polyurethanes, and any of the other SP's described earlier, ceramics such as silicon<br>
carbide, shape-memory alloy:; such as nitinol, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
These materials are commercially available or methods for their production are<br>
known.<br><br>
The agile tool molding surface preferably has an optical quality surface<br>
finish if it contacts the optically critical surface(s) of the SMP or SMA mold. The<br>
non-molding surface of the ag Je tool need not have an optical quality finish.<br>
However, the non-molding suilace of the agile tool must be sufficiently pliant,<br>
flexible, and durable to enable its repeated contact, and action upon it by, the<br>
adjustment means, and may be formed from an elastomer or the like.<br>
Preferably, the molding surface of the agile tool, singly or in combination<br>
with the non-molding surface of the agile tool, is in the form of a membrane, more<br>
preferably a polymeric membrane. In a most preferred embodiment, the molding<br>
surface is a membrane of a su,e and shape suitable for production of a soft contact<br>
lens and is about 0.5 to about 5000, preferably 1 to about 1000 microns in thickness.<br>
Adjustment means may contact the non-molding surface of the agile tool of<br>
the invention under conditions suitable to deform the defonnable portion of the<br>
molding surface of the agile tool to the desired shape. Adjustment means may be<br>
any means capable of manipulating and deforming the deformable portion of the<br>
molding surface of the agile tool to the degree necessary to obtain the desired<br>
configuration of the molding surface of the agile tool. Examples of such adjustment<br>
means include, without limitation, fluids, micro-actuators, such as piezo-electric,<br>
micro-motorized, or hydrauli; micro-actuators, magneto-restrictive actuators,<br>
electro-static actuators, electio-active polymers, and the like that move in response<br>
to an input signal. For example, by vaiying the voltage applied to a series of piezo-<br>
electric micro-actuators, the deformable portion of the molding surface may be<br>
displaced so that it assumes i. desired shape. An array of pins or concentric tubes<br>
wherein each pin or tube is c ipable of having its height individually adjusted,<br>
relative to a datum and locked into place to thereby form the desired shape can be<br>
used as the adjustment means.<br><br>
In embodiments in which micro-actuators in the agile tools are used to form<br>
the molds of this invention, spacmg of the actuators may be determined by the<br>
resolution requirement of the surface of the mold to be formed by the agile tool and<br>
ultimately the ophthalmic product to be formed by the mold. The resolution<br>
requirements will be determined by the features desired to be imparted onto the<br>
surface of the mold and/or lensC The adjustment means may be used in combination<br>
with heat to alter the shape of tie molding surface of the agile tool. The use of heat<br>
will be required if the molding surface of the agile tool also comprises an SMP or<br>
SMA. The Tg of the SMP or SMA that is used as the deformable surface of the agile<br>
tool should be higher than that of the SMA used to form the ophthalmic lens mold.<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 show an exemplar/ agile tool 210 used to make a mold of the<br>
invention comprising shape memory poly/mer or alloy. The agile tool has a layer<br>
220 which may be a single material or may comprise several materials or layers<br>
having a concave molding surf ace 213 and convex non-molding surface 214.<br>
Enclosure 211 is shown suppoiting agile tool 210. An array of micro-actuators 218<br>
is shown contacting non-molding surface 214, which acts as the adjustment means.<br>
Molding surface 213 has a portion 215 that is deformable and of a first shape of a<br>
radius of curvature R1, which radius will change upon actuation of the adjustment<br>
means. Additionally, as shown, molding; surface 213 has areas 216 and 217 each of<br>
a fixed radius of curvature. Area 216 is continuous with and extends around portion<br>
215. Area 217 is continuous with and extends around area 216. The mold to be<br>
formed by areas 216 and 217 are those that will form the portions of the lens outside<br>
the optical zone of the lens. ID an alternative embodiment, areas 216 and 217 also<br>
may have unfixed radii of curvature and be subject to the adjustment means. When<br>
the plurality of actuators 218 are actuated and moves non-molding surface 214, this<br>
causes the deformable portion 215 of molding surface 213 to be deformed to the<br>
desired shape.<br><br>
The agile tool 210 shov/n in Figs. 9 and 10 is preferably used to form a<br>
second mold member or back c urve. Foi purposes of molding a mold member, a<br>
core element 4 complementary to agile tool 210 may be used, as shown in Figure 9.<br>
Another agile tool (not shown) can be used with a complementary core element (not<br>
shown) to form the first mold member or front curve, similar to the use of the pair of<br>
presses shown in Figures 1 and 2 to make the pair of mold members. However, a<br>
single agile tool that can widely adjust its molding surface from convex to concave<br>
could be used in combination with one or more core elements to form both mold<br>
members, if desired.<br>
After the actuated surface 213, whose shape is controlled by adjustment<br>
means 218, is set to the desired shape, the SMP material 12, which may be flat or<br>
preformed into spherical or toric shape, is introduced to the agile tool 210 in a<br>
manner that may be analogouswith the method employed in the press process. That<br>
is, an alignment jig 15, in which an SMP holder 10 is disposed, is utilized to dispose<br>
the SMP 12 between a core element 4 and the molding surface 213. Upon<br>
disposition of the SMP 12 into ;oo agile tool 210, and after the temperature of the<br>
SMP is raised to or above the SMP glass transition temperature, the core element 4,<br>
presses the SMP 12 into contacl with the actuated surface 213, at the requisite<br>
pressure. The temperature is then reduced below the SMP glass transition<br>
temperature, preferably to ambient temperature, until the temperature of the SMP<br>
decreases below its glass transit on temperature, and then core element 4, is lifted<br>
from the SMP 12. Then, SMP 12, in the shape of a contact lens mold half, is<br>
removed from agile tool 213. The same process may be repeated to form a first<br>
mold member using an agile tool shaped to form the first mold member (not shown).<br>
Alternatively, instead of or in addition to, setting the actuated surface 213,<br>
whose shape is controlled by adj ustment means 218, to the desired shape prior to<br>
introduction of the SMP sheet irto the agile mold, the adjustment means 218 may be<br>
changed while the SMP sheet is in contact with the agile mold.<br><br>
In alternative embodimeits for mEiking the mold of this invention using an<br>
agile tool, the core element 4 as shown in Fig. 9 may be replaced by a stream of gas<br>
(not shown), or by a vacuum (not shown) pulled on the surface 218 of the sheet 12.<br>
In embodiments in which gas pressure is used to press the sheet 12 against the<br>
molding surface 213, so that sheet 12 takes the shape of the molding surface 213, the<br>
optical forming surface of the mold may be formed on either surface 218 or 219 of<br>
sheet 12. If the optical forming surface is formed on surface 219 of sheet 12, the<br>
layer 220 of the agile tool 210 may or may not be used. (Actually if the surface<br>
roughness of the adjustment mains without any layer is low enough, although this<br>
would complicate the fabrication of the adjustment means, the layer of the agile<br>
mold would be optional even if he optical forming surface of the mold is the surface<br>
pressed against the adjustment means.) It is preferred that in the embodiments using<br>
gas pressure as the core element that the optical forming surface of the SMP 12 will<br>
not contact any solid surface that will impart its surface imperfections to the optical<br>
forming surface of the mold and thereby to the lens made using the mold. The<br>
optical forming surface of a mold, that is, the surface of the mold that contacts the<br>
lens forming material, preferably has a root mean square surface roughness of no<br>
more than about 20 nanometers. It is presently believed that the methods that use<br>
gas pressure as the core element and. during which the optical forming surface is<br>
not contacted by any solids, proydde the smoothest optical forming surfaces, because<br>
surface smoothness of the result mg mold member is equal to that of the starting<br>
material (sheet 12), which typicsilly is well below 20 nm RMS.<br>
Note that in me embodiment employing a press wherein the core element<br>
was provided by air or gas pressure, as described earlier, the optical forming surface<br>
was not contacted by the air or gas; however, that embodiment could be modified to<br>
provide that the optical forming surface could be the one contacted by the air or gas<br>
to provide the benefits just described. Additionally in any of these embodiments<br>
that use a stream of gas, that preferably is inert to the SMP, the gas stream may be<br><br>
used to heat and/or cool the SMP in the process of forming the mold comprising<br>
SMP. The preferred gas for these embodiments is air. However, if air reacts with<br>
the SMP employed, then a low cost inert gas, such as nitrogen, may be alternatively<br>
utilized.<br>
As described earlier for 'he other embodiments, in specific operation, the<br>
agile die is preadjusted, by spec fie adjustment of adjustment means, to the desired<br>
shape of the SMP sheet 12 when formed into a mold member. The SMP sheet 12<br>
may be disposed in a holder 10 and in an alignment jig 15. The jig is used to center<br>
the SMP sheet 12 with respect to the agile die. The SMP sheet, clamped at its edges<br>
in holder 10, which is disposed in alignment jig 15, is heated above its glass<br>
transition temperature. The healing step may be provided by conduction, i.e. direct<br>
heating, by such means as providing the cliamp with heating means; by convection,<br>
i.e. using a heated gas; or by radiation, e.g. infrared (ER) heating. Of these heating<br>
means, radiation heating, because of the speed at which the SMP maybe heated, is<br>
preferred. The SMP material is leated at or above the transition temperature, is<br>
subjected to a high pressure iner: gas stream, by application of a vacuum or both.<br>
The pressure and velocity of the gas stream is such that the SMP sheet 12 assumes<br>
the shape defined by adjustment means or molding surface, if present, transferred to<br>
the side of the SMP 12 exposed :o the gas stream. In an alternate embodiment, a<br>
vacuum source, may supplemem or replace the gas stream. Upon formation of the<br>
desired shape, the SMP sample is cooled to ambient temperature, by removing the<br>
heating source, to "lock-in" the desired shape. The clamped edges, which form a<br>
flange for the contact lens mold nalves, is released and the formed SMP contact lens<br>
mold is removed.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the lens molds comprising SMP or<br>
SMA may be formed in an agile tool comprising an adjustment means that is a<br>
mechanical magnetic field deformation means. In this embodiment, a first magnetic<br>
surface contacts the layer of the igile tool. Preferably, the magnetic surface is of a<br><br>
shape that is complementary to the layer of the agile tool. The magnetic surface<br>
may be constructed of any magnetic material capable of withstanding the molding<br>
process environment and, preferably, is of a material that is capable of being<br>
physically or chemically bondaed to the non-molding surface of the agile tool.<br>
Suitable materials include, without limiration, magnetic ferrous steels, cast or<br>
sintered alnicos, bonded or siitered ferrites, lodex, P-6 alloy, cunife, cunico,<br>
vicalloy, remalloy, platinum :obalt, cobalt-rare earth blends, and the like and<br>
combinations thereof.C  Alternatively, with the proper selection of materials the<br>
magnetic surface can be the molding surface.<br>
A second magnetic surface is brought into sufficient proximity to the first<br>
magnetic surface to exert a r lagnetic force upon the first surface that is effective to<br>
impart a desired shape to the first magnetic surface and, through that first molding<br>
surface, to the molding surface of the agile tool. The second magnetic surface may<br>
be positioned by any converient positioning means including, without limitation, a<br>
robotic arm, a gripper, an ac justable mechanical arm, or the like or a combination<br>
thereof. Either or both the first and second magnetic surfaces may be formed of a<br>
series of electromagnets.<br>
i	Fig. 11 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention in which the<br>
adjustment means of an agile tool used to form a mold member of the invention is a<br>
magnetic field deformation means. Molding surface 213 has deformable portion<br>
215. Non-molding surface 214 is in. contact with it first magnetic material 221.<br>
Second magnetic material .122 is brought into proximity of first magnetic material<br>
221 by mechanical arm 223, which arm is movably mounted so that it can be<br>
manipulated in the directions shown by the arrows. A magnetic force is exerted on<br>
material 221 by material 2.22 resulting in the deformation of material 221 and<br>
deformable molding surface 215. Although not shown the agile tools, preferably<br>
have a feed back mechanism, such as an interferomic technique, used to feed<br><br>
information back to the adjustment means regarding the position and shape of the<br>
molding surface, the non-molding surface, or both.<br>
In another embodiment, an ophtlialmic mold comprising an SMP may be<br>
fabricated to incorporate intriiLsic actuators. Intrinsic actuators are discrete areas of<br>
the mold, comprising the SMI' that can be activated by heat that can be individually<br>
applied to the intrinsic actuators to make precise changes to the surface of the mold<br>
used to form the ophthalmic p roduct. The precise changes are controlled by the size<br>
of the intrinsic actuators, the composition of the intrinsic actuators, and the number<br>
of intrinsic actuators heated. One method of preparing the SMP material having<br>
intrinsic actuators is illustrated in Figures 12,13 and 14. In Fig. 12, the SMP is cast<br>
into a precast mold 70 to form a preform 79 formed within the precast mold 70.<br>
(The method differs from the other embodiments as described which started out with<br>
a sheet of SMP that had been oast in a flat mold, preferably a two sided flat mold<br>
having at least one optical quality surface to form the sheet (i.e. a flat preform.) The<br>
precast mold 70, as shown provides a spherical preform 79, however other shapes<br>
can be formed instead. The precast mold 70 comprises two parts, the first part 75<br>
and the second part 76. The first and second parts 75 and 76 can comprise any<br>
materials, e.g. metal or glass; however., if it is preferred to provide an optical surface<br>
to the preform 79 at least on the surface contacting the first part 75, therefore metal<br>
or glass having an optical surface finish should be used to form the first part 75 of<br>
the precast mold 70. The seccnd part 7(5 has an array or some assembly of small<br>
features 71 that provide for projections 72 on the surface of the preform 79. The<br>
projections 72 are present on the surface of the preform 79 opposite the surface that<br>
provides the optical forming s jrface of Ihe ophthalmic mold that the preform 79 will<br>
be modified to become. The j rejections 72 can have dimensions extending from a<br>
few microns to hundreds of microns. Once the preform 79 has been formed in the<br>
precast mold 70, it is removed and further processed as shown in Fig. 13.<br><br>
The preform 79 is then preferably placed in a compression fixture 81 having<br>
a bowl-shape indentation 83 similar to the shape of the preform 79 into which the<br>
preform is placed. The flange 77 of the preform 79 would be clamped to the fixture<br>
81 by clamping means (not shewn). The SMP preform will be heated to a<br>
temperature above its glass transition temperature and then compacted between the<br>
fixture 81 and a pestle 82 shaped to complement the fixture 81, both of which may<br>
be spherical, or toric or otherwise shaped. The fixture 81 and pestle 82 compress the<br>
projections 72 while retaining tlie overall shape of the preform 79. The preform 79<br>
would be subsequently cooled to below it:; glass transition temperature, and removed<br>
from the fixture 81. The projections 72 would no longer project as far from the<br>
surface of the preform 79, but would act as intrinsic actuators 85 in the preform 79<br>
that would be used to shape the optical forming surface 84 of the preform 79 as<br>
shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The pestle 82 could be termed from a metal (e.g. brass) that had been<br>
diamond point turned or glass so that it has; a surface roughness of 20 run RMS, or<br>
better. It is also possible that the SMP preform 79 and projections 72 could be<br>
compressed using air pressure to replace the pestle 82.<br>
The preform 79 can be used as an ophthalmic mold or used to form an<br>
ophthalmic mold of this invention. The surface 84 of the preform 79 is preferably<br>
formed to provide optical charact sristics and/or preferably can be changed via the<br>
intrinsic actuators 85 to provide customized optical characteristics. The preform<br>
surface 84 could be modified by 1.eating each intrinsic actuator 85 individually to a<br>
temperature above the SMP Tg, as needed., using a local heating source indicated by<br>
the arrows 86 in Fig. 14. This local heating source 86 could be a CO2 laser, or an<br>
array of micro-heating coils. The heating would occur for some period of time<br>
referred to as the heating dwell time and then the intrinsic actuator 85 would be<br>
allowed to cool to a temperature b slow the SMP Tg. After heating and cooling the<br>
intrinsic actuator 85 the shape of the surface 84 in the area of the intrinsic actuator<br><br>
85 that was heated would change. Heating the intrinsic actuator 85 will cause it to<br>
recover its original shape, eith;r partially or entirely depending on the total heating<br>
time.<br>
The heating of the intriisic actuators 85 preferably occurs in an agile tool 90<br>
shown in Fig. 14. The preform 79 is clamped into the agile tool 90 by clamping<br>
means (not shown). The agile i ool 90 has an array of heaters 86 which are the<br>
adjustment means in the agile tool. The agile tool 90 also provides a molding<br>
surface 91 for the preform to be pressed against so that as the heated intrinsic<br>
actuator 85 recovers its original shape it pushes against the molding surface of the<br>
agile mold 90 thereby pushing and raising the surface 84 of the lens mold 79. By<br>
heating one or more of the intrir sic actuators 85 accordingly, the desired lens mold<br>
shape may be achieved. Alternatively, the: adjustment means could be a single<br>
heater that could be moved via a computer controlled robot and positioned beneath<br>
the intrinsic actuators to be heart d.<br>
Figure 14 shows preform 79, that will be used as an ophthalmic mold after<br>
removal from the agile tool 90, for which the intrinsic actuator 85' was heated by<br>
heating source 86' and the surfacs 84 of tilts mold was thereby modified.<br>
The intrinsic actuators and the balance of the preform or ophthalmic mold<br>
may comprise the same shape memory polymers or different shape memory<br>
polymers. Alternatively, the intriisic actuators may comprise a shape memory<br>
polymer and the balance of the pr eform may comprise an alternative material that is<br>
not a shape memory polymer that is compatible with the shape memory polymer<br>
material.<br>
In the agile tools which nuy be used to form the molds of the invention,<br>
input signals to the adjustment me ms may be, and preferably are, the distortions or<br>
aberrations of the eye for which the lens is being manufactured. Clinical wavefront<br><br>
sensors, such as aberroscopes, Hartmaim-Shack devices and mirror arrays capable of<br>
measuring these aberrations ar i commercially available. The wavefront data, or<br>
measured aberrations, may be represented by a set of mathematical coefficients,<br>
such as Zemike coefficients, that may be used to form the input signals that drive the<br>
adjustment means. The adjustrient means modifies the mold to impart one or more<br>
optical characteristics onto all or a portion of a surface of the mold to be formed<br>
within the agile tool. The adjustment means may modify the mold directly or by<br>
deforming the deformable portion of the molding surface of the agile tool.<br>
Configuration of software suitable for processing and inputting the signals for<br>
purposes of driving the adjustment means is within the skill of one ordinarily skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
The data obtained through the use of the wavefront sensors may be reported<br>
in terms of Zemike coefficients. This data then is converted mathematically into an<br>
elevation map above and below a designated mean sphere value to obtain the optical<br>
path difference. These elevations are then used to determine the shape to be<br>
imparted to a surface of the mold (and thai to the lens). For the manufacture of<br>
molds, these elevations preferabiy will determine the shape of the optically critical<br>
surfaces of the molds.<br>
In addition to optical characteristics, the molding surface of the agile tool,<br>
may be used to impart a geometr/ to the optically critical surface of a second mold<br>
member, or back curve, so that th e lens formed within the mold, has a back surface<br>
that substantially corresponds wih that of the lens wearer's cornea. Such<br>
modifications to the back surface may require additional modifications to the front<br>
surface via the front curve also. ' rhis function of the mold of the invention may find<br>
its greatest utility in the manufacture of contact lenses. The corneal topographic<br>
data for the lens wearer may be acquired using conventional topographers. The data<br>
initially may be applied to a soft contact lens model in an unflexed state and then by<br>
taking into account lens flexure when the lens is placed onto the wearer's eye.<br><br>
For contact lenses, preierably, corneal data is used to determine the elevation<br>
map of the lens' back surface. Mapping of the corneal elevation onto the lens<br>
surface may be carried out by ;iny known method. For soft contact lens production,<br>
preferably, mapping is carried out so that the error introduced by flexure of the lens<br>
is minimizedC  In this method, the corneal elevation data is applied to a soft contact<br>
lens in the unflexed state. The elevation data is then transformed by taking into<br>
account lens flexure. Further ihe data is manipulated for application of the data to<br>
the optically critical surface oi a mold, preferably the back curve lens mold, so that it<br>
will have the intended effect on the back surface of the contact lens.<br>
In this method, for practical considerations, it is assumed that the ideal<br>
cornea is spherical and that the: actual corneal elevations and their best spherical fit<br>
are denoted f(x) and g(x), the function g(x) being part of a sphere having radius Ra.<br>
In general, the radius Rb of an unflexed soft contact lens is spherical and is larger<br>
than that of the best spherical Bt g(x). The first step is to transform the corneal<br>
elevations f(x) into a larger sc ale for which the best spherical fit will have a radius<br>
equal to Rb- One approach in simplifying the transformation is to represent the<br>
function f(x) in polar coordinetes as f(0). Then using the scale factor a = Rb/Ra, the<br>
scaled version of the corneal elevation may be expressed as :<br><br>
In the second stage, ths scaled corneal elevation, f (9), is scaled down so that<br>
the area covered by the soft contact lens corresponds to the area of the cornea. In a<br>
two dimensional case, this scaling down is obtained according to the following<br>
relationship: <br>
The mapping transfon nations given in the above equations are not restricted<br>
to the case in which the cornea and the back surface of the contact lens are spherical.<br><br>
Rather, the true corneal and lens curvatures may be used to calculate the scale<br>
parameter a as a ratio between the lens and the corneal radius of curvature. In the<br>
general case, the scale parameter will be a function of 0, i.e., a = Rb(0)/Ra(0) =<br>
a(6).<br>
The mapping transformation discussed above may be generalized to the case<br>
of three dimensional transformation. In such a case, the corneal elevations may be<br>
represented by a function, f(θ,o) where 0 andC represent the azimuth and elevation<br>
angle, respectively. The origiral elevation data is scaled up from the radius of<br>
curvature Ra (θ,φ) using the following transformation relationship:<br><br>
To obtain a desired bank surface of the lens, the functional f(1)(θ,φ)is scaled<br>
back down. However, in the three dimensional case, there are a number of options<br>
to choose from in performing the scaling operation such that the area is preserved.<br>
For example, if it is assumed 'hat the deformation of the material is uniformly radial,<br>
the scaling may be performed by scaling the elevation angle only, leaving the<br>
original azimuth angle. This s expressed in the following relationship:<br><br>
Once the mold is defcrmed to the desired shape, via one of the embodiments<br>
described, the mold is then used to form the desired ophthalmic product. Therefore,<br>
in another embodiment, the i ivention provides a process for manufacturing a mold<br>
comprising a shape memory polymer comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of the steps of: a.) providing an agile tool comprising adjustment means<br>
b.) adjusting said adjustmenl means to impart one or more optical characteristics<br>
onto a surface of a shape menory polymer or alloy; c.) placing a shape memory<br><br>
polymer or alloy preform into said agile tool; d.) heating at least some portion of<br>
said preform; and e.) cooling said preform.<br>
The shape memory polymer can be introduced onto the agile tool as<br>
described above for the press, tiat is by using a holder and an alignment jig.<br>
The mold of this invent on is used in a process of making an ophthalmic<br>
lens. The lens-forming material may be any material suitable for forming an<br>
ophthalmic lens. Exemplary spectacle lens-forming materials include, without<br>
limitation, polycarbonates, such as bisphenol A polycarbonates, allyl diglycol<br>
carbonates, such as diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate (CR-39™), allylic esters,<br>
such as triallyl cyanurate, triall A phosphate and triallyl citrate, acrylic esters,<br>
acrylates, methacrylates, such is methyl- ethyl- and butyl methacrylates and<br>
acrylates, styrenics, polyesters, and the like and combinations thereof. Additionally,<br>
the lens forming material may &gt;e one or more of the phosphine oxides disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,008,299 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
Suitable lens-forming materials for contact lenses are any materials useful<br>
for forming hard or soft contact lenses. Preferably, the lens-forming material is<br>
suitable for forming a soft com act lens. Illustrative materials for formation of soft<br>
contact lenses include, without limitation silicone elastomers, silicone-containing<br>
macromers including, without [imitation, those disclosed in United States Patent<br>
Nos. 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and 5,057,578 incorporated in their entireties herein by<br>
reference, hydrogels, sihcone-containiBg hydrogels, and the like and combinations<br>
thereof. More preferably, the surface is a siloxane, or contains a siloxane<br>
functionality, including, witho it limitation, polydimethyl siloxane macromers,<br>
methacryloxypropyl polyalkyl siloxanes, and mixtures thereof, silicone hydrogel or<br>
a hydrogel, such as etafilcon A.<br><br>
Suitable materials for forming iatraocular lenses include, without limitation,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, inert clear plastics, silicone-<br>
based polymers, and the like ind combinations thereof.<br>
Curing of the lens forming material deposited within the mold may be<br>
carried out by any means kno wn including, without limitation, thermal, irradiation,<br>
chemical, electromagnetic raciation curing and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, molding is carried out using ultraviolet light or using the full spectrum of<br>
visible light. Many shape memory polymers are transparent to ultraviolet or visible<br>
light making them particularly well suited for use as ophthalmic molds.<br>
More specifically, the conditions suitable for curing the lens-forming<br>
material will depend on the m iterial selected and the lens to be formed. For<br>
formation of spectacle lenses, a preferred curing condition is a two-stage UV cure in<br>
which the mold assembly is exposed to low intensity and then high intensity<br>
ultraviolet light. Low intensity UV light is UV light with an intensity of about 0.5 to<br>
about 50, preferably about 1 tc about 5 mW/cm2. High intensity UV light is of an<br>
intensity of about 50 to about 2000, preferably 500 to about 1500 mW/cm2. The<br>
wavelengths at which the exposures are carried out may be, and preferably are, the<br>
same. Suitable wavelengths are about 300 to about 450, preferably about 360 to<br>
about 400 run. The time for the low intensity exposure will depend on the lens-<br>
material selected, the type and amount of any initiator used, material viscosity and<br>
the nature of its reactive groups, and the intensity of the UV light. Subsequent to the<br>
termination of the low intensity exposure, the mold assembly is exposed to high<br>
intensity UV light under conditions suitable to complete through-cure of the lens-<br>
forming. The same factors determinative for low intensity exposure time are<br>
determinative for the high inter sity exposure time. Both high and low intensity<br>
exposure may, and preferably are, carried out as single, continuous exposures.<br>
However, the exposures also may be carried out using alternating periods of UV<br>
exposure and non-exposure per.ods. The low and high intensity polymerization<br>
steps may be carried out at a temperature between about 10 to about 50° C and<br><br>
atmospheric pressure, preferably at ambient temperature. The UV exposure may be<br>
used alone or in combination with heat.<br>
Polymerization proces ses for contact lenses are well known. Suitable<br>
processes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,540,410 incorporated herein in its<br>
entirety by reference. For formation of contact lenses, a preferred curing condition<br>
is to pre-cure the mold assembly using UV light with an intensity of about 2 to about<br>
10 mW/cm2. Following the p-e-cure, the mold assembly is exposed to UV light of<br>
an intensity of about 0 to about 4.0 mW/cm2. Suitable wavelengths are about 300 to<br>
about 500 nm. The time for the low intensity exposure will depend on the lens-<br>
material selected, the type anc. amount of any initiator used, material viscosity and<br>
the nature of its reactive groups, and the: intensity of the UV light. Both pre-cure and<br>
subsequent UV exposure ma&gt;, and preferably are, carried out as single, continuous<br>
exposures. However, the expasures also may be carried out using alternating<br>
periods of UV exposure and r on-exposure periods. The polymerization steps<br>
preferably is carried out at a t imperative between about 40 to about 75° C and<br>
atmospheric pressure preferably under a blanket of nitrogen gas. Total cure time is<br>
between about 300 to about 5 DO seconds. Once the curing is completed and the<br>
formed lens is removed from the mold. Depending on the lens material, the lens<br>
may go through further processing prior to use. Additional process steps, such as<br>
hydration, inspection, and packaging have been disclosed in the prior art.<br>
The mold comprising the SMP or SMA may be re-used after it is used to<br>
form an ophthalmic product. The SMP or SMA is just heated above it glass<br>
transition temperature and preferably returned to its preform shape, either flattened<br>
into a sheet and cooled or compressed in a compression fixture to return it to its non-<br>
deformed mold shape and cooled. The SMP or SMA preform sheet can be used<br>
again in any of the methods c f making the mold described herein. The SMP and<br>
SMA molds can alternatively be re-shaped without returning them to their preform<br>
shape. With care the SMP and SMA molds can be used to form multiple lenses,<br>
although preferably they are ised once and then returned to their preform shape.<br><br>
The adjustment means nay be manipulated so that the agile tool returns to its<br>
first shape or assumes another shape for use in forming a mold of another<br>
prescription. Alternatively, in the case that the molding surface of an agile tool is an<br>
SMP or an SMA, all or a portion of the molding surface first may be deformed by<br>
the adjustment means, heated lo above the molding surface material's Tg,<br>
subsequently cooled, and then it can be re-used to form another mold.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the mold of the invention may be used<br>
to provide any ophthalmic lenses suitable to correct visual acuity defects. However,<br>
the molds of the invention may find particular utility in providing lenses that are<br>
formed using an agile tool tha: can be customized to correct the aberrations, both<br>
low and high order, of a speciic lens wearer. Fig. 15 is a flow diagram of a method<br>
for providing such lenses using the molds of the invention.<br>
In step 401 of the method, a lens, wearer's prescription information is<br>
determined. By "prescription information" is meant information necessary to<br>
correct the low order aberrations of (he lens wearer. This information includes,<br>
without limitation, sphere, cy.inder, axis, add power, and the like, and combinations<br>
thereof. The information may be obtained using conventional ocular measuring<br>
devices or, and preferably, by use of wavefront sensors. Optionally and preferably,<br>
in step 402, optical data is deiermined for the lens wearer. "Optical data" means<br>
measurement of higher order ocular aberrations. Such data is obtained using<br>
wavefront sensors. Finally, optionaUy and preferably, patient fit data is determined<br>
in step 403. For contact lenses, such data will include, without limitation, corneal<br>
topographic measurements of the lens wearer's cornea.C  For spectacle lenses, such<br>
information will include, without limitation, fitting height, distance zone pupillary<br>
distance, and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
The prescription infoirnation, optical data, and patient fit data (collectively,<br>
the "order information") is tt.en sent to the lens manufacturer (404) by any<br><br>
convenient ordering means including, without limitation, telephone, facsimile<br>
transmission, internet website, and the Like and combinations thereof. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, ordering is carried out via the lens manufacturer's internet website by<br>
the customer using any means capable of communicating with the lens<br>
manufacturer's server system (web server or web site). Suitable means for<br>
communicating with the webste include, without limitation, a personal computer<br>
and modem. Thus, in yet anotaer embodiment the invention provides a method for<br>
producing customized ophthalmic lenses comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of the steps of: a.) 'ransmitting, by a customer using a computer system,<br>
to a lens manufacturer's serve:- system lens order information; b.) manufacturing by<br>
the lens manufacturer at least one mold member using an agile tool comprising,<br>
adjustment means for deformiig a molding surface (405); and c.) forming a lens<br>
using said mold member (406).<br>
In carrying out manufacturing of the lenses, the lens manufacture uses the<br>
order information, in whole or in part, to drive the adjustment means of the agile tool<br>
to manufacture a mold member and using the mold member preferably in<br>
combination with another mo d member to manufacture the wearer's lens. By<br>
"customer" is meant an ordercr of spectacle lenses, contact lenses, interocular lenses<br>
or the like. Examples of lens orderers include, without limitation, ophthalmologists,<br>
optometrists, opticians, lens r stailers, lens wearers, and the like. Preferably, the<br>
method of the invention is earned out so that it is a business-to-business system.<br>
One or more mold members used to form ophthalmic lenses may comprise<br>
the shape memory polymers or shape memory alloys. Alternatively, one mold<br>
member formed using the shsipe memory polymers or shape memory alloys of this<br>
invention may be paired with a second mold member that has been formed using<br>
conventional methods and m iterials, e.g. by injection molding a thermoplastic<br>
material as disclosed and described in US Serial No. 09/305,886 filed May 5,1999,<br>
and US Patent 5,545,366 wh ch are bolh incorporated herein by reference, or by the<br><br>
use of a reusable mold formec. out of quartz or glass. In one embodiment, the mold<br>
member comprising the shape memory polymers or shape memory alloys, preferably<br>
a second mold member may t e formed using an agile tool that adjusts its molding<br>
surface to account for the lens wearer's cornea's surface information. The first mold<br>
member (to be paired with this second mold member that comprises the SMP or<br>
SMA) may provide for a common power correction i.e. to correct for defocus errors,<br>
that can be provided either w th a reusable mold member, or a mold member that<br>
can be readily injection mold 3d. Therefore, the mold of this invention may comprise<br>
a mold member comprising S MP or SMA, and another mold member that does not<br>
comprise SMP or SMA. The mold member that does not comprise SMP or SMA<br>
may be a reusable mold merr ber or a disposable mold member.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the scope of the present<br>
invention. Because these exsunples are: given for illustrative purposes only, the<br>
invention should not be deemed limited thereto. The first two examples describe the<br>
process of making the preferred shape memory polymers.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A polymeric reactioi. mixture was formulated by mixing vinyl neodecanoate<br>
(7%), divinyl benzene (1%), and styrene (90%) in random order to yield a clear<br>
solution. Benzoyl peroxide (2%) was then added to the resulting solution (all<br>
composition % are by weight). The resulting solution was kept cold in a refrigerator<br>
before use. To prepare the shape memory polymer (SMP), the reaction mixture<br>
formulated above was injeci ed by syringe into a mold fabricated with two 14" by<br>
14" glass plates separated by Viton spacer. The two sheets of glass were held<br>
together by clamps around Ihe edges. The Viton spacer also acts as sealant in the<br>
mold. The sample was ther heated in an oven maintained at atmospheric pressure<br>
and a temperature of 75°C for 24 hours. After the sample was cured for the<br>
specified period of time, it 7vas removed from the oven and immediately transferred<br><br>
to a warm water bath. The temperature of water used was about 60°C. The SMP<br>
sheet formed was demolded under the warm water by applying a slight prying force<br>
at the edges of the mold. The released SMP sheet was then allowed to dry and cool<br>
down to room temperature.<br>
At the conclusion of l his polymerization process a clear preform sheet of a<br>
cured shape memory polymer was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A polymeric reaction mixture was formulated by mixing vinyl neodecanoate<br>
(7%), divinyl benzene (1%). and styrene (60%) in random order to form a colorless<br>
solution. Polystyrene granules (30%) were then added to the resulting solution. The<br>
resulting mixture was then silo wed to sit at room temperature with occasional<br>
stirring until all the polystyiene granules were dissolved to give a clear, viscous<br>
solution. Benzoyl peroxide (2%) was, then added to the resulting solution (all<br>
composition % are by weigit). The resulting mixture was ultrasonicated at room<br>
temperature for 15 minutes to yield a clear solution . The resulting solution was kept<br>
cold in a refrigerator before use. To prepare the shape memory polymer (SMP), the<br>
reaction mixture formulated above was injected by syringe into a mold fabricated<br>
with two 14" by 14" glass plates separated by Viton spacer. The two sheets of glass<br>
were held together by clamps around the edges. The Viton spacer also acts as<br>
sealant in the mold. The simple was then heated at 75°C at atmospheric pressure for<br>
24 hours. After the samplt was cured for the specified period of time, it was<br>
removed from the oven ami immediately transferred to a warm water bath. The<br>
temperature of water used was about 60°C. The SMP sheet formed was demolded<br>
under the warm water by applying a slight prying force at the edges of the mold.<br>
The released SMP sheet was then allowed to dry and cool down to room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
At the conclusion of this polymerization process a clear preform sheet of a<br>
cured shape memory polymer was obtained.<br>
The following examples, ExEiraples 3 and 4 describe a process of making a<br>
mold member comprising an SMP using a press.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A sheet of polynorbornene SMP having a wide thickness variation of<br>
between 0.65 mm and 0.85 jnm was cut into discs that were accommodated in a<br>
holding device of the type illustrated in the drawings. The SMP disc, disposed in<br>
the holding device, was placed in an alignment jig of the type depicted in the<br>
drawings and disposed between a base curve element and a core element of the type<br>
shown in the drawings.<br>
The thus formed assembly was disposed on a hot plate and a 25 lb weight<br>
was placed atop the core element. The SMP sample was heated to a temperature<br>
slightly in excess of its glasu transition temperature and then the pressure was<br>
applied. It is emphasized that this temperature was in excess of the curing<br>
temperature of the SMP pol ynorborere<br>
The SMP disc, pressed between the core and base curve elements, was<br>
formed into the shape of the base curve element. Thereupon, the 25 lb weight and<br>
the hot plate were removed and the apparatus was cooled to ambient temperature<br>
and the thus formed front curve lens mold was removed.<br>
The aforementioned contact lens mold member forming process was<br>
repeated four times to produce five mold members. The thus formed contact lens<br>
mold members were analyzed to deteimine their curvature characteristics and their<br>
surface roughness. This was accomplished by measuring curvature, i.e. radius, in<br><br>
millimeters, and its deviation from form, as measured as "PV." This value, when<br>
multiplied by 633 nanometers, yields the degree of deviation, in nanometers, of the<br>
mold part. These measurements were made with a Mark IV GPIXP ®<br>
interferometer. Surface smooihness, as measured by root mean square roughness, in<br>
microns, was also measured by an interferometer, albeit a different type of<br>
interferometer, a New View 3]) Surface ® interferometer.<br>
In addition to these tests, the brass insert into which the SMP molds were<br>
disposed was measured for rad .us and PV values. Obviously, these values are the<br>
same for all five molds since the SMP molds are formed of a single base curve<br>
element designed for a specific metal insert.<br>
The results of these test;; and measurements are summarized in Table 1.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Another example, in acco rdance with that described in Example 3, was<br>
conducted in which four female SMP contact lens mold halves were formed of the<br><br>
same sheet of polynorbornene used in Example 1. However, the four molds were<br>
fabricated using four different base curve elements. Thus each mold was formed<br>
from a different press assemb]y.<br>
The measured resultsC eported for this example were identical to the results<br>
reported in Example 3 with the exception that the surface roughness of the metal<br>
inserts was also reported, usir g the same instruments used in Example 3. However,<br>
two additional comparisons were included in this example. The first additional<br>
comparison was a measurement of the surface roughness of the SMP sheet from<br>
which the SMP molds were formed, litis measurement was made in accordance<br>
with the procedure utilized in the determination of the surface roughness of the SMP<br>
molds and metal inserts. The second additional comparison was another surface<br>
roughness measurement. Ho wever, this measurement compared the surface<br>
roughness of a contact lens mold half prepared in accordance with the prior art<br>
procedure of utilizing anon-SMP, e.g. polystyrene, sheet as the contact lens mold<br>
material of construction.<br>
The results of this exunple are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The above embodiment and examples are provided to illustrate the scope and<br>
spirit of the present invention. These embodiments and examples will make<br>
apparent, to those skilled in the art, other embodiments and examples. Those other<br>
embodiments and examples are within the contemplation of the present invention.<br>
