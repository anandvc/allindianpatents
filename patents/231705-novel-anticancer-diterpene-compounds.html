				<td>NOVEL ANTICANCER DITERPENE COMPOUNDS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to two compounds namely ent-pimmarane 8(14), 15-diene-19-oic acid (compound 1) and ent-pimmarane 7(8), 9(11), 15-diene-10 oic acid (compound 2), its isolation from Lavatera cachmeriania. The compounds significantly in vitro inhibited the growth of number of human cancer cell lines such as CNS : SK-N-MC, Colon : HT-29, Lung : A-549, Liver: Hep-2, Ovary : OVCAR-5, and Prostate : PC-3, representing different organs. Background of invention:<br>
Cancer or neoplasm is the malignant new growth anywhere and elsewhere in the body system. It is characterized by unregulated proliferation of cells and a growing public health problem whose estimated worldwide new incidence is about six million cases per year. In most of the countries, cancer is second only to heart disease as cause of death. It can arise in any organ of the body but some sites are prone to attack than others such as breast, throat, intestine, leukocytes etc. Each cancer is propagated from a single cell that cut at some stage, it becomes free from its territorial restraints, which form a family of cells that multiply without limits and appear in the form of tumors.<br>
During the transition from normal cell to a tumor cell a profound and heritable change occurs which allows a<br>
tumor cell to determine its own activities largely irrespective of the laws that govern so precisely the growth<br>
of all normal cells in an organism. This newly acquired property , which is known as autonomy, is the most<br>
important single characteristic of tumor cells since without it there would be no tumors. Another<br>
distinguishing characteristic of tumor cells is their lack of perfect form of function. The differences that exist<br>
between cancer and normal cells are that, compared to normal cells, cancer cells have a) low   pH	b)<br>
greater free radical character    c)   tumor produced hormone peptides       d)     tumor associated antigens      e)      lower calcium ion and higher potassium ion concentration    f)   different potassium isotope ratios g)elevated amounts of methylated nucleotides        h)     higher concentration of plasma microproteins and mucopolysacharides       i)       greater need of exogenous zinc and      j)     high   bio water content. Many of the gross causes of cancer, such as dietary, environmental, occupational exposure to certain chemical substances or forms of electromagnetic radiation, have been elucidated through    epidemiological    studies.    It   is     imperative,<br><br><br>
therefore, that they be identified and eliminated from the environment in so far as that is possible in, modern industrial societies.<br>
In the annals of therapy, a quest to conquer, the impasse of cancer has been always fascinated, by and large, all disciplines of scientific community, especially natural product chemists. In 19th and 20th century, lot of research work has been carried out to find out the driving force behind this dreadful disease as well as large number of drugs have been introduced to counter its menace. The plants have always fascinated the scientists and as a result number of drugs for different diseases including cancer have been isolated from the plants. It is worthwhile at this juncture to look briefly at a tew most powerful chemotherapeutic agents, which have been of paramount importance to the mankind and also to the researches who have been actively involved in the synthesis and isolation of anticancer drugs.<br>
The well known anticancer drugs from plants are vinca alkaloids, vinblastine and vincristine from Catharanathus roseus (Smets, L.A; 1994, Anticancer Drugs, 5 : 3 -- 9) and podophyllotoxin from podophyllum peltatum (Royal society of chemistry, London, 1997) which is not used but its two semi synthetic glycosides, Etoposide and Tenioposide arc in clinical use (F. Gago, I drugs, 1999, 2, 309, K.Z. Rana et. al. Pharmacotherapy, 1999, 19, 35). The later addition in the list of anticancer drugs from plants is paclitaxel (Rowinsky, E. K., and Donehowar, R. C. Paclitaxel (Taxol). N. Engl. J. Med. 1995, 332 : 1004-1014). The complex diterpene, Taxol (A. Endo, J. Med. Chem; 1985, 28, 401), was isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel along with several key precursors (baccatins), occurs in the leaves of various taxus species, such as Docetaxel (A. Endo. J. Antibiot, 1979, 32, 852), has provided a major, renewable natural source of this important class of drugs.<br>
With the above background we focussed our attention towards the identification and isolation of potent cytotoxic agent(s) from plants. There is hardly any report regarding isolation and characterisation of compounds from Lavatera cachmeriania. (family malvaceae). Lavatera cachmeriania is a semi-evergreen, woody-based perenial, with wiry stems. The flowers are silky and clear pink in colour. The leaves are mid-green, ivy shaped, and downy. Lavatera cachmeriania is described as a minor variant of L. thuringiaca; however the foliage is distinctive.The 20-25 species of Lavatera have a broadly Mediterranean distribution stretching to south west Britain, the canary is Abyssinia .central Asia and Kashmir with out lying species in Australia and eastern Siberia<br><br>
However, this plant genus is known to have cathartic and anti-inflammatory<br>
activities (Nazionale dele Ricerche, Economic Botany, Bari, v.25 (1) p-107 Oct;<br>
1998).<br>
The isolated compounds from the plant genus are dihydromalvalic acid from the<br>
seed oils (Vickey and J.R., JAOCS, J. Am oil Chem Soc. Australia 1981, 58, 731-<br>
32), cyclopropene and dihydrostercuklic acids (fatty acids)  From the plant<br>
species (Vickey and J.R., JAOCS, J. Am oil Chem. Soc. Australia 1980, 57(2) ,<br>
87-91), cyclopenoid from the seeds (Lotti, G.lzzo, R., 1st Ind. Agrar University,<br>
Agrar 1993, 11(9), 303-8).   All these compounds exhibit activities other than<br>
anticancer.<br>

The structure of Compound 1 was elucidated as ent-pimmarane-8(14), l5-diene-19 oic acid and structure is annexed herewith. Compound I was observed as white crystalline solid. The LC-MS of compound-1 showed the molecular ion peak M+ t Na at m/z 325.1, corresponding to the molecular mass at m/z 302 corresponding to C^oHsoOj. The functional nature of two oxygen atoms in the form of carboxylic group was further revealed by the IR spectrum umax 3552-3228 cm"1, (O-H) 1684 cm"' (C=O) 1598, 1410 and 910 cm ' (tri-substituted double bond) 1264, 1024, 860 cm"1 (di-substituted double bond as well).<br>
The 'H-N1V1R spectrum (Table 1) of Compound I revealed the presence of an exocylic disubstituted double bond by displaying an ABX pattern of coupled protons at 8 4.90 (IH, dd, .1=6, 7Hz, Ha-16), 4.95 (IH, dd, J=6, 7 Hz, Hb-16) and 5.72 (IH, dd, J=6, 7Hz, Hx-15). The spectrum contained a broad singlet at 5 5.14 (IH, H-15) confirming the presence of a tri-substituted double bond in the molecule.<br>
Since the Compound I shows end absorption in UV spectrum, XmaxMeoH 215 nm, it rules out the presence of conjugation in the molecule.<br>
The presence of carboxyl function was confirmed by preparation of methyl ester of Compound 1 with diazomethane, whose 'H-NMR spectrum contained the resonance signal due to carbonyl methoxy protons at 83.63 (3H, s) and showed a downfield shift in the resonance signals of two methyls to 80.99 (3H, s) and 1.19 (3H,s). Hence the structure assigned to the molecule of Compound 1 is annexed herewith. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>

The human cancer cell lines were obtained either from National center for cell science, Pune, India or National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, U. S. A. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium with 2mM glutamine, lOOfig/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, sterilized by filtration and supplemented with 10% sterilized fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin before use) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator. The cells at subconfluent stage were harvested from the flask by treatment with trypsin (0.05% trypsin in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA) and suspended in complete growth medium.<br><br>
Cells with cell viability of more than 97% by trypan blue exclusion technique were used for determination of cytotoxicity.<br>
Compound 1 was dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) to obtain a stock solution of 20 mg/ml. The stock solution was serially diluted with complete growth medium containing 50 u.g/ml of gentamycin to obtain three working test solutions of 200, 60 and 20 ug/ml.<br>
The suspension of human cancer cell lines of required cell density in complete growth medium was prepared and cell suspension of each cell line was placed in 96-well tissue culture plate (100 uJ per well) for control, Compound 1 and positive control(s). The blank wells for each cell line and concentration of test material were also included that contained equivalent amount of complete growth medium only. The plates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CC&gt;2 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator. The experiment was carried out in triplicate.<br>
After 24-hours of incubation, the working solutions of Compound 1 of different concentrations (100 ul) were added in the experimental wells and blanks whereas positive controls of required concentrations (100 uJ) were added into wells for positive controls. The equivalent amount of complete growth medium was added to control set.<br>
The plates were further incubated for 48-hours (at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO? and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator) after addition of test material etc. and then the cell growth was stopped by gently layering of 50 uJ of TCA (50% trichloroacetic acid) on top of the medium in all the wells. The plates were incubated at 4°C for one hour to fix the cells attached to the bottom of the wells. Liquids of all the wells were gently pipetted out and discarded. The plates were washed five times with distilled water to remove TCA, growth medium, low molecular weight metabolites, serum proteins etc. Plates were air dried.<br>
Cell growth was measured by staining with sulforhodamine B dye (SRB). The SRB solution (100 \i\ of 0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The unbound SRB was quickly removed by washing the wells five times with 1% acetic acid and plates were air dried. Tris-buffer (100 u.1 of 0.01 M, pH 10.4) was added to all the wells and plates<br><br>
were gently stirred for 5 minutes on a mechanical stirrer. The optical density was recorded on ELISA reader at 540 nm.<br>
The eel I growth in presence of test material was determined by subtracting mean OD value of respective blank from the mean OD value of experimental set. Like wise, cell growth in absence of test material (control set) and in presence of positive control was also determined. The per cent cell growth in presence of test material was determined considering the cell growth in absence of test material as 100% and in turn per cent inhibition was calculated.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of Compound 1 was determined against human cervix (SiHa), CNS (SK-N-MC), colon (HT-29), lung (A-549 &amp; HOP-62), liver (Hep-2), ovary (OVCAR-5) and prostate (PC-3) representing different organs. The results are summarized in Table 5. Compound 1 showed dose dependent inhibition of cell growth of all the human cancer cell lines studied except HOP-62. The inhibition varied from 41-97% at 100 u.g/ml. It was most effective against human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and least effective against cervix cell line SiHa.<br>
The structure of Compound 2 was elucidated as ent-pimmarane-7(8), 9(11), 15-triene-19 oic acid and is annexed herewith.<br>
The GC-MS of Compound 2 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 300 coresponding to molecular formula C2oH28C&gt;2. The compound responded to the Vanillin - ^SCU test for terpenoids and bromocresol green test for carboxylic acids on TLC plates.<br>
IR = vmax 3520-2880 cm "' (OH), 1678 (CO), vmax 1440, 1408, 1330, 1184, 1092, 910 and 756 cm"' (Tri. Subst. Double bond)<br>
The 'H-NMR spectrum (Table 3) of Compound 2 revealed the presence of an exocyclic di-substituted double bond by displaying an ABX pattern of coupled protons at cS 4.88 (1H, d, J=2.0 6 Hz, Ha-16), 4.91 (1H, d, J=5.0.Hz, Hb-16) and 4.94 (IH, t, J==5,2 Hz, Hx-15). The spectrum contained two singlets at 5 5.62 (1H, H-7) and 5.75 (IH, H-ll) confirming the presence of two tri-substituted double bonds which are in confugation<br>
Since the compound Compound 2 shows UV absorption at XmaxMeoH 240 nm, it must possess a conjugated chromophore in the molecule.<br>
Since the proton resonance signal of the tri substituted double bond appeared as a singlet the most plausible position for it is A 7,8 and A 9,11. The 13C-NMR (Table<br><br>
4) resonance signals for the vinylic carbons appeared at 8c 120.3 (C-7), 8c 146.8 (C-8), 8c-138.3 (C-9), 5c 138.4 (C-ll), 113.3 (C-16) and 147.5 (C-15). This was further substantiated by the chemical shift, multiplicity and coupling constants of allylic protons at C-6 and CM 2 at 52.31 (1H, dd, br, J-5,8, Hz, H-6) and 2.14 (1H, br,<br>
d,J=5H-12).<br>
The mass spectrum of the compound showed a facile loss of CC^H and HCOiH from the molecular ion resulting in the base peak fragment at m/z 257 and a strong peak at m/z 256.<br>
The presence of carboxyl function was confirmed by preparation of methyl ester of LK-3 with diazomethane whose 'H-NMR spectrum contained the resonance signal due to carboxyl methoxy protons at 8 3.63 (3H, s) and an downfield shift in the resoance signals of two methyls at 8 0.99 (3H, s) and 1.19 (3H, s). In vitro cytotoxicity of Compound 2 against human cancer cell lines:<br>
The human cancer cell lines were grown, harvested and cytotoxicity was determined exactly as mentioned in Example 3 except that the test material used was Compound 2 that was dissolved in DMSO and three working test solutions were prepared of the same concentrations as in Example 3.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of Compound 2 was determined against the same human cancer cell lines as in Example 3 representing different organs. The results are summarized in Table 5. Compound 2 showed dose dependent inhibition of cell growth of all the human cancer cell lines studied except HOP-62. The inhibition varied from 38-97% at 100 ug/ml. It was least effective against human cervix cancer cell line (SiHa) but was highly active against rest of the cell lines.<br><br>
