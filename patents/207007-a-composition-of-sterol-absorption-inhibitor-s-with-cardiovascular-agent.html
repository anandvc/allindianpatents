The present invention relates to methods, compositions and therapeutic combinations comprising certain cardiovascular agents and sterol absorption inhibitors for treating atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and other vascular conditions in mammals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vascular disease is a term that broadly encompasses all disorders of blood vessels including small and large arteries and veins and blood flow. The most prevalent form of vascular disease is arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with the thickening and hardening of the arterial wall. Arteriosclerosis of the large vessels is referred to as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the predominant underlying factor in vascular disorders such as coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, arterial disease of the lower extremities and cerebrovascular disease.<br>
One major risk factor for arteriosclerosis is high serum cholesterol. A total cholesterol level in excess of 225-250 mg/dl is associated with significant elevation of risk of vascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease.<br>
Cholesteryl esters are a major component of atherosclerotic lesions and the major storage form of cholesterol in arterial wall cells. Formation of cholesteryl esters is also a step in the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol. Thus, inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation and reduction of serum cholesterol can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation, decrease the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in the arterial wall, and block the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol.<br>
The regulation of whole-body cholesterol homeostasis in mammals and animals involves the regulation of dietary cholesterol and modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, bile acid biosynthesis and the catabolism of the cholesterol-containing plasma lipoproteins. The liver is the major organ responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism and, for this reason, it is a prime determinant of plasma cholesterol levels. The liver is the site of synthesis and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) which are subsequently metabolized to low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the circulation. LDL are the predominant cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in the plasma and an increase in their concentration is correlated with increased atherosclerosis. When intestinal cholesterol absorption is reduced, by<br><br>
whatever means, less cholesterol is delivered to the liver. The consequence of this action is decreased hepatic lipoprotein (VLDL) production and an increase in the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesterol, mostly as LDL. Thus, the net effect of inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption is a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 5,767,115, 5,624,920, 5,668,990, 5,656,624 and 5,688,787, respectively, disclose hydroxy-substituted azetidinone compounds and substituted p-lactam compounds useful for lowering cholesterol and/or in inhibiting the formation of cholesterol-containing lesions in mammalian arterial walls. U.S. Patents Nos. 5,846,966 and 5,661,145, respectively, disclose hydroxy-substituted azetidinone compounds or substituted p-lactam compounds in combination with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors for preventing or treating atherosclerosis and reducing plasma cholesterol levels.<br>
PCT Patent Application No. WO 00/38725 discloses cardiovascular therapeutic combinations including an ileal bile acid transport inhibitor or cholesteryl ester transport protein inhibitor in combination with a fibric acid derivative, nicotinic acid derivative, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, cholesterol absorption antagonist, phytosterol, stanol, antihypertensive agent or bile acid sequestrant.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,698,527 discloses ergostanone derivatives substituted with disaccharides as cholesterol absorption inhibitors, employed alone or in combination with certain other cholesterol lowering agents, which are useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and related disorders.<br>
Other vascular conditions frequently coexist with cholesterol levels associated with atherosclerosis. These may include hypertension, angina and/or arrhythmia. The relevance of, for example, elevated blood pressure as a risk factor for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in both men and women has been clarified in a large number of epidemiological studies.<br>
Clinical trials of blood pressure lowering using cardiovascular agents including, for example, calcium channel blockers, have shown beneficial effects in the treatment of early atherosclerotic lesions (see, e.g., Lichtien, P.R. etai :Lancet, 335: 1109-1113 (1990) and Waters, D. et al. Circulation 82: 1940-1953 (1990)). Scott (PCT patent Application No. WO 99/11260) describes combinations of an<br><br>
HMG CoA reductase inhibitor with an antihypertensive agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis and other symptoms of vascular disease risk. Additionally, Egon et al. (PCT Patent Application No. WO 96/40255) describe a combination therapy of antihypertensive agents including eplerenone and angiotensin II antagonist for treating cardiovascular disease.<br>
Despite recent improvements in the treatment of vascular disease, there remains a need in the art for improved compositions and treatments for atherosclerosis, other vascular diseases and conditions associated with vascular diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidaemia.<br>

An angiotensin system inhibitor is an agent that interferes with the function, synthesis or catabolism of angiotensin II. These agents which may be used in the present invention include but are not limited to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, agents that activate the catabolism of angiotensin II and agents that prevent the synthesis of angiotensin I from which angiotensin II is ultimately derived. The renin-angiotensin system is involved in the regulation of hemodynamics and water and electrolyte balance. Factors that lower blood volume, renal profusion, or the concentration of Na+ in plasma tend to activate the system, while factors that increase these parameters tend to suppress its function. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II are synthesized by the enzymatic renin-angiotensin pathway. The synthetic process is initiated when the enzyme renin acts on angiotensinogen, a pseudoglobulin in blood plasma, to produce the cecapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. The latter is an active pressor substance which has been implicated as a causative agent in several forms of hypertension in various mammalian species.<br>
"Angiotensin II receptor antagonists" are compounds which interfere with the activity of angiotensin II by binding to angiotensin II receptors and interfering with its activity. Well known angiotensin II receptor antagonists which may be used in the present invention include peptide compounds and non-peptide compounds.<br><br>

The term "therapeutically effective amount" means that amount of a therapeutic agent of the composition, such as the cardiovascular agents, sterol absorption inhibitor(s) and other pharmacological or therapeutic agents described below, that will elicit a biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or mammal that is being sought by the administrator (such as a researcher, doctor or veterinarian) which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the condition or disease being treated and the prevention, slowing or halting of progression of the condition (for example a vascular condition as discussed above).<br>
As used herein, "combination therapy" or "therapeutic combination" means the administration of two or more different therapeutic agents, such as cardiovascular agent(s) and sterol absorption inhibitor(s), to prevent or treat a vascular condition, such as hyperlipidaemia (for example atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia or sitosterolemia), stroke, diabetes, obesity and/or reduce the level of sterol(s) in the plasma. As used herein, "vascular" comprises cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and combinations thereof. Such administration includes coadministration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single tablet or capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each therapeutic agent. Also, such administration includes use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment using the combination therapy will provide beneficial effects in treating the vascular condition and other conditions as<br><br>
discussed above. A potential advantage of the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a reduction in the required amount of an individual therapeutic compound or the overall total amount of therapeutic compounds that are effective in treating the vascular condition. By using a combination of therapeutic agents, the side effects of the individual compounds can be reduced as compared to a monotherapy, which can improve patient compliance. Also, therapeutic agents can be selected to provide a broader range of complimentary effects or complimentary modes of action.<br>
As discussed above, the compositions, pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention comprise one or more sterol absorption inhibitors, such as the substituted azetidinone sterol absorption inhibitors or substituted p-lactam sterol absorption inhibitors discussed in detail below. As used herein, "sterol absorption inhibitor" means a compound capable of inhibiting the absorption of one or more sterols, including but not limited to cholesterol, phytosterols (such as sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and avenosterol), 5a-stanols (such as cholestanol, 5a-campestanol, 5a-sitostanol), and mixtures thereof, when administered in a therapeutically effective (sterol absorption inhibiting) amount to a mammal or human.<br>

is -OR , wherein R is hydrogen, R^ can be -OR wherein R is lower alkyl). Those skilled in the art will recognize that the size and nature of the substituent(s) will affect the number of substituents that can be present.<br>
Compounds of the invention have at least one asymmetrical carbon atom and therefore all isomers, including enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers and racemates of the compounds of Formulae (l-XI) (where they exist) are contemplated as being part of this invention. The invention includes d and I isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting optically pure or<br><br>
optically enriched starting materials or by separating isomers of a compound of the Formulae l-XI. Isomers may also include geometric isomers, e.g., when a double bond is present.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some of the compounds of the Formulas l-XI, one isomer will show greater pharmacological activity than other isomers.<br>
Compounds of the invention with an amino group can form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salt is prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The free base form differs from its respective salt form somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salt is otherwise equivalent to its respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention are acidic (e.g., those compounds which possess a carboxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. Examples of such salts are the sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also included are salts formed with pharmaceutical^ acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
