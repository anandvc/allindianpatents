				<td>This invention relates to a seal crimping device for crimping and detecting the absence of seals for LP gas cylinders<br>
Background:<br>
One of the problems of LPG distribution to the customer is the possibility of pilferage of some of the LPG from the cylinder somewhere along the distribution chain. To ensure that this does not happen, the gas company applies a pilfer proof seal to the cylinder outlet valve. This seal is designed such that attempts to open the valve will damage the seal in an easily detectable way. An undamaged seal is the customers assurance that he is getting a cylinder which has not been tampered with.<br>
After LP gas cylinders are filled, the valve on the cylinder is covered with a known plastic cap (60) (Figs, la to Ic of the accompanying drawings). The<br>
design of the cap is such that its removal can only be accomplished by pulling the wire clip (602) incorporated in the cap to release its lock on the valve and then pulling the cap vertically.<br>
Once the known cap is fitted to the valve, a cup shaped seal (50) made of thin aluminium sheet (Figs. 2a &amp; 2b of the accompanying drawings) is placed manually on it. The seal contains several score marks (502) on its surface to weaken it. This seal is then crimped in a machine to bend the seal skirt (501) under the flange (603) of the cap as shown in figure (3). Because of the presence of the seal the wire clip of the cap cannot be forced out without damaging the seal by cracking the score marks in a visible way.<br>
Because of the high production rate of modem filling plants the Crimping Machine is fully automatic.<br><br>
Two problems are attendant to this sealing process. The first problem is that if the crimping is not of good quality the seal can be removed by carefully unbending the bent skirt and reapplied without this tampering being evident.<br>
This lack of quality is caused by the fact that a crimping action which presses the skirt of the seal radially inwards is unable to sufficiently press it against the flange of the cap. The partial crimp thus produced is often inadequate to assure tamper proof sealing.<br>
To solve this problem it is desirable that the crimping device be designed to provide a firm crimp preferably by forcefully pressing the seal skirt against the cap flange.<br>
The second problem is that since seal placement is manual it is vulnerable to operator in attention or absence. In this case the cylinder passes thru the automated crimping operation without the seal being applied. And in the absence of further checks it passes out of the plant as an unsealed cylinder.<br>
To solve this problem it is desirable that the crimping device has some means to sense that the seal is absent and indicate this condition to the automatic circuitry which controls the operation, so that remedial action can be taken.<br>
Electronic methods of sensing the seal (inductive sensing etc.) are undesirable because the environment in which the sealing is conducted contains explosive gases. It is thus desirable that the seal sensing be conducted by entirely mechanical and pneumatic means. For efficiency, it is also desirable that this sensing be conducted during the crimping operation itself.<br><br>
The objects of the invention are to eliminate both the above problems by using a double acting crimping mechanism and mechanical plus pneumatic seal sensing mechanism.<br>
To achieve the said objectives, this invention provides a seal crimping device for crimping and detecting the absence of seals for LP gas cylinders comprising a cylindrical outer shell, a mouth piece fixed at the bottom of the said outer shell,<br>
characterized in that<br>
a central stem fixed axially in the said outer shell,<br>
a piston fixed slidably on the said central stem,<br>
a jaw means for crimping the seal first radially and then axially for achieving a firm crimp ,<br>
a crimping cam means fixed to the said piston for moving the said jaw means,<br>
an upper pivot ring means fixed to the lower end of the central stem for pivotably supporting the said jaw means at the radial stage of crimping,<br>
a lower pivot ring means fixed in the said mouth piece for supporting the jaw means at radial stage of crimping.,<br>
connecting means fixed to the top of said piston and extending upwards through holes in said outer shell,<br><br>
a push plate means fixed to the upper end of said connecting means,<br>
a pressure ring means fixed slidably on said central stem<br>
a spring means mounted between the cap and said pressure ring means to force up the crimping cam means and downwards on the pressure ring means to force open the jaws and return the piston to the initial position,<br>
a means for sensing the completion of the crimping motion embedded in the outer shell and actuated by said push plate means, and<br>
a means for sensing the absence of seal in said central stem. The said jaw means comprises multiplicity of jaws. The connecting means are connecting rods.<br>
The means for sensing the completion of the crimping motion is normally closed pneumatic valve embedded in said outer shell and actuated by the push plate means.<br>
The means for sensing is a seal feeler.<br>
The seal feeler comprises two prongs extending out through holes in the front face of the stem.<br><br>
The means for sensing the seal feeler position is a pneumatic valve actuated by a feeler pin.<br>

Referring to the drawings, a crimping device, according to this invention, consists of a cylindrical outer shell (2), a mouth piece (3) fixed at the bottom of the said outer shell (2), a central stem (4) fixed axially in the said outer shell (2),<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, a crimping device, according to this invention, consists of a cylindrical outer shell (2), a mouth piece (3) fixed at the bottom of the said outer shell (2), a central stem (4) fixed axially in the said outer shell (2), a piston (9) fixed slidably on the said central stem (4) and multiplicity of jaws (1). It further includes a cylindrical crimping cam (5) fixed to the said piston (9) for moving the said jaws (1). There is an upper pivot ring (6) fixed to the lower end of the central stem (4) for pivotably supporting the said jaws (1) at the radial stage of motion. A lower pivot ring (7) is fixed in the said mouth piece (3). A pressure ring (8) is fixed slidably on said central stem (4) and the connecting rods are fixed to the top of said piston (9), which extends upwards through holes in said outer shell (2). A push plate (11) is fixed to the upper end of said connecting rods (10) and a spring (12) is mounted between the cap and said pressure ring (8) to force up the crimping cam (5) and downwards on the pressure ring (8) to force open the jaws (1).<br>
The means for sensing the completion of the crimping motion is normally closed pneumatic valve (15) embedded in said outer shell (2) and actuated by the push plate (11).<br>
Further, it consists of a seal feeler (13), as a means for sensing the absence of seal in the said central stem (4), wherein the seal feeler (13) contains two prongs (131) extending out through holes (402) in the front face (403) of the stem (4). The means for sensing the seal feeler (13) position is the normally opened pneumatic valve (16) actuated by a feeler pin (14).<br>
The means for giving the pneumatic signal that the seal is absent is said normally opened valve, with this its supply connected to the output of normally closed valve.<br><br>
Detailed description of the device.<br>
Figure 5a shows the device in the idle condition.<br>
In application the crimping device is lowered on to the cylinder valves in which a cap &amp; seal has been placed before hand. The lowering is done by a pneumatic actuator acting on the push plate (11).<br>
As the device lowered on to the valve, the bottom of the central stem (403) contacts the top of the seal (50) as shown in figure 5b. Further downward movement of the central stem is thus stopped. As the actuator continues to press down on the push plate its force is transmitted thru the connecting rods (11) to the piston (9). Thus moving the piston and the attached crimping cam (5) downwards against the action of the spring (12). Downward movement of the crimping cam causes the cam to ride on to the tapered sides (105) of the jaws(l).<br>
Since the jaws are pivotably supported on the upper pivot ring (6) the action of the cam is to pivot the jaw tips (101) radially inwards.<br>
The radial movement of the jaws forces the jaw tips (101) to press against this seal skirt (501) and bend it inwards.<br>
This radial inward movement continues until the side of the recess (104) in the lower side of the jaw contacts the lower pivot ring (7). The jaws are sized such that when this happens the edge (51) of the crimping cam seats on to the steps (102) on the jaws. This condition is shown in figure 5c.<br><br>
Further downward movement of the crimping cam forces the jaw to unseat from the upper pivot ring and to pivot around the lower pivot ring.<br>
The position of the edge of the lower pivot ring is such that it is approximately on a horizontal plane passing through the jaw tip. Thus the pivoting action of the jaw on the lower pivot ring forces the jaw tips to move axially upwards.<br>
This movement continues until the bulge (103) on the outer face of the jaw contacts the side of the recess (52) of the crimping cam.<br>
This upwards movement of the jaw tips has the effect of further deforming the seal skirt and pressing it on to the flange of the cap. Thus forming a firm crimp. This condition is shown in figure 5d.<br>
Since the jaw has no further freedom of movement in this condition the crimping cam cannot be forced further down.<br>
The connecting rods are sized such that in this position the push plate actuates a normally closed pneumatic valve (15) embedded in the upper portion of the outer shell (2).<br>
The pneumatic valve is supplied with compressed air at port (201). The output of the valve appears at port (203) and is directed to the pneumatic circuitry controlling the crimping actuator. This signals the completion of the crimping action. The pneumatic circuit is arranged to lift the crimping actuator on receipt of this signal.<br>
A portion of this output is also directed into the supply of the valve (16) by port (205).<br><br>
During the lifting action the spring (12) forces the piston (9) and pressure ring (8) apart to retract the crimping cam (5) and permit the force of the pressure ring on lips (106) of the jaws and to open the jaws to return the device to the initial position of figure 5a.<br>
An important feature of the device is the ability to detect if the seal is missing and provide a pneumatic signal indicating its absence.<br>
This is accomplished thru seal feeler (13) within the central stem (4) of the device. The seal feeler is housed in slot (401) in the central stem. It contains two prongs (131) extending out thru holes (402) in the front face (403) of the stem as visible in figure 5a.<br>
The rear face of the feeler is pushed downward by spring (17) via feeler pin (14). So that the prongs of the feeler extend out of the front face to the central stem and the feeler pin is out of contact with the actuator (161) of the pneumatic valve (16).<br>
When the device is lowered onto the valve the feeler prongs contact the seal and are forced upwards, thus pushing the feeler Pin (14) upward against the actuator pin of valve (16). This condition is shown in figure 5d.<br>
The valve (16) is a normally open valve supplied via the output of the normally closed valve (15). The output of valve (16) is directed out of the crimping device via port (204).<br>
The feeler pin (14) is dimensioned such that if both prongs of the feeler have been pressed up then the top of the feeler pin (14) contacts the actuator pin<br><br>
(161) of valve (16). Since this is a normally open valve no output signal appears at port (204) in this actuated condition. This condition is shown in figure 5d.<br>
If however, no seal is present on the cap then one or both of the prongs (131) will fall into the peripheral gaps (601) on the top of the cap (60) as shown in figure 6. If this happens then the upward movement of the feeler is insufficient to actuate the valve (16).<br>
If the valve (16) is not actuated then being a normally open valve it will give an output at port (204) on the completion of the crimping stroke. This output is connected to the controlling pneumatic circuit to signal the absence of seal. Peripheral equipment of various kinds can be used to utilize this signal to reject this cylinder.<br><br><br><br><br>
