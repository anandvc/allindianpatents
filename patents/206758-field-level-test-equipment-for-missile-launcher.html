(a)	Performance check of launcher with test equipment.<br>
(b)	Verification of harmonization of missile and optical axes of launcher with axes harmonization setup.<br>
Best Mode of Operation:<br>
Performance Check of launcher:<br>
Launcher, the unit under test is used for loading the missile on ramp adapter (5) as shown in Fig. 1, launching of missile by pressing the trigger of the trigger mechanism (2) as shown in Fig. 1. Optical Device (4) as shown in Fig. 1 is used for selection of the target and for receiving of IR flare signal from the flying missile and generating Frequency Modulated error voltage proportional to missile deviation from line of sight. Line of Sight is the line joining the Optical axis of the launcher and the target. The Frequency Modulated signal generated by optical device is processed by the Guidance Electronic Unit (3) as shown in Fig. 1, which generates deviation error signals correction commands signal proportional to the missile deviation to be transmitted to the missile for guiding it on to hit the target.<br><br>
In testing the launcher using field level test equipment. Collimator is used for generating IR signal equivalent to the missile deviation from line of sight. The electronic control unit is used for switching on the launcher by giving required power supply and switching signals at appropriate timings, measures different signals generated by the launcher, error voltages generated w.r.t. IR signal provided by collimator and the corresponding correction commands generated by the Guidance Electronic Unit. These signals are compared with the standard reference data stored in the EPROM (Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory) by the Microprocessor circuitry in the CPU PCB of Electronic Control Unit and the performance of the launcher is displayed GO or NOGO on front panel automatically.<br>
Now coming to the overall operation of the field level test equipment, there are two test programs viz.<br>
Verification of the test equipment (self test)<br>
Verification of the launcher (testing).<br>
The purpose of this 'Self Test' of the test equipment is to ensure complete serviceability of the test equipment prior to checking the launcher, in each mode of operation. After connecting test cables to the test equipment, the system is to be switched-on by putting the Power ON / OFF switch to "ON" position and reset the system by pressing the "RESET" push button. The equipment will be first self-tested and after passing the self-test, it proceeds automatically to test mode.<br>
During this 'Self-test', following parts of the circuit are checked pertaining to test equipment control electronics operation viz., RAM Test, INPUT / OUTPUT PORTS TEST, Timers test, ADC Test, DAC test, simulated gyro frequency test and power supplies test.<br><br>
If all the above checks are satisfactory, the visual indicator "READY" glows on the front panel and proceeds to test the launcher, depending upon the position of mode selector switch. If the indicator 'READY' does not glow, the test equipment is faulty and it does not proceed further. The equipment is capable of carrying out the tests in the following seven modes viz.,<br>
-	Total System mode: The test equipment carries out tests on complete launcher with Ramp Adapter (which includes trigger mechanism. Guidance electronic unit and optical device) and gives result finally as 'GO' or 'NOGO'.<br>
-	Ramp Adapter (SAFE) mode:	In this mode, the test equipment carries out tests on Ramp adapter (5) as shown in Fig. 2 in 'SAFE' mode and gives result finally as 'GO' or 'NOGO'.<br>
-	Ramp Adapter (ARM) mode: In this mode of testing, the test equipment<br>
tests the functional performance of the Ramp adapter (5) as shown in Fig. 2 in<br>
'ARM' mode and gives the result in the form of 'GO' or 'NOGO' on the front<br>
panel.<br>
" Trigger mode: In this mode, the test equipment tests only the performance of the Trigger mechanism (2) as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Optics mode: In this mode, the test equipment tests only the optical device (4) as shown in Fig. 2 performance, isolating the Guidance Electronics unit and Trigger mechanism.<br>
-	Electronic Unit mode: In this mode of testing, the test equipment tests the<br>
complete Guidance Electronics unit (5) as shown in Fig. 2 and gives the result<br>
in the form of 'GO' or 'NOGO' on the Front panel.<br>
DAY/NIGHT Tracer mode: In this mode, the test equipment tests the function of DAY/NIGHT tracer selection switch of the Guidance Electronic Unit (5) as shown in Fig. 2, to ensure that the ignition circuit of the day tracer is isolated, when the selector switch is in "NIGHT" mode and gives the result in the form of 'GO' or 'NOGO' on the front panel and vice versa.<br><br>
Approximately 16 seconds are required for the test equipment to say GO or 'NOGO' after pressing the trigger mechanism, in total system mode.<br>
At the beginning of testing the launcher, the battery voltage is to be verified, by observing the LOWBAT indication on the front panel. There is a provision for connecting an external supply of DC 26 V ± 4.0 @ 4.0 amps.<br>
Verification of Harmonization of missile and optical axes:<br>
Axes harmonization set up consisting of Harmonising Sighting Gauge (6) as shown in Fig. 3, 50 mts lens clamp (5) as shown in Fig. 3, Harmonising Sighting Board (7) as shown in Fig. 3. Functional description of the above parts was already described in previous paragraphs.<br>
The Harmonising sighting board (7) with stand (8) as shown in Fig, 3 is kept at a distance of 50 mts from launcher (1) as shown in Fig. 3 and the Harmonising Sighting Gauge is mounted on ramp adapter of launcher (2) as shown in Fig. 3 in place of missile. The sighting gauge is focused on to the Red Cross marking (10) as shown in Fig. 3 on the sighting board. Viewing through the eye piece (4) as shown in Fig. 3 of optical device (3) as shown in Fig. 3, the optical device small circle should match with the circular target (9) as shown in Fig. 3 marked on the sighting board.<br>
If the circle of the optical device matches with the tolerance circle marked on the sighting board, the axes harmonization is correct otherwise the harmonisation shall be achieved by adjusting the screws provided on the launcher.<br>
The 50 mts lens clamp shall be used for correct focusing of the optical device for viewing at 50 mts distance.<br>
It will be appreciated that the arrangement according to the invention has been described at length with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof. Variation and modification can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention as described herein above and as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
