				<td>TITLE: POLYURETHANE DISPERSANTS<br>
This application claims priority from GB 0311121.8 filed May 15, 2003.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polyurethane dispersants, to dispersions, millbases, paints and inks containing a particulate solid dispersed in a non-aqueous organic medium, particularly a polar organic medium, including inks for use in non-contact printing processes such as "Drop-oii-demand" printing process. In particular, the dispersants exhibit an essentially linear backbone with laterally attached side-chains of solvent solubilizing polyester, polyacrylic, polyether or polyolefin side chains including mixtures of such side chains. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A polyurethane containing polyoxyethylene side-chains is known and has been described in the patent literature. For example, EP 060,430 discloses a process for making a polyurethane having polyalkylene oxide side-chains characterised in that the polyalkylene oxide used as starting alcohol has at least two free hydroxyl groups separated by not more than 3 carbon atoms, which hydroxy groups react with â€¢diisocyanates. The polyurethane may be used to stabilise or destabilise foams, emulsions and dispersions. They may also be used with pigments and fillers. However, there is no mention that the polyurethane may be used as dispersants in non-aqueous media and especially in the preparation of non-aqueous millbases, paints and inks.<br>
JP1995179801 A discloses a water soluble acrylic graft copolymer with a polyurethane backbone. The grafted copolymer has carboxylic acid functional groups that may be incorporated into the backbone or within the grafted acrylic portion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a non-aqueous composition comprising a particulate solid, an organic medium and a polyurethane dispersant having an essentially linear backbone with laterally attached solvent-solubilizing<br>
side chains of polyester, polyacrylic, polyether or polyolefin including mixtures of such side chains.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a non-aqueous composition comprising a participate solid, an organic medium and a polyurethane dispersant having an essentially linear backbone with laterally attached solvent-solubilizing side chains of polyester, polyacrylic (especially a polyacrylate), polyether or polyolefin including mixtures of such side chains. The optimum choice of the solvent solubilising side chain will be dependent on the polarity of the organic medium. In one embodiment the polyolefin is present and in another embodiment the polyolefin is absent.<br>
In one embodiment the non-aqueous composition optionally contains 5 wt % or less water, preferably less than 2 wt %, more preferably less than 0.5 wt.% and most preferably no water.<br>
Whereas the polyester, polyether, polyacrylate or polyolefin side chains may contain a terminating hydroxy group remote from the polyurethane backbone it is much preferred that such chains carry a [terminating] group which is not reactive with isocyanates and especially a C1-50-hydrocarbyl group since this restricts any cross-linking during the preparation of the dispersant. The hydrocarbyl group may be optionally branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl.<br>
The cycloalkyl group is preferably C3-6cycloalkyl such as cyclopropyl and especially cyclohexyl.<br>
The aryl group is preferably C1-10-aryl such as naphthyl and especially phenyl which may be substituted by halogen, C1-20-alkyl or C1-20-alkoxy.<br>
The aralkyl group is preferably 2-phenylethyl and especially benzyl where the phenyl ring is optionally substituted by halogen, C1-20-alkyl or C1-20-alkoxy.<br>
The length of the alkyl terminating group of the polyester, polyether, polyacrylate, or polyolefin chain depends to a large extent on the nature of the organic medium. Thus, for example, when the organic medium is a polar organic liquid, the hydrocarbyl group is preferably C1-12-alkyl which may be linear or branched. The hydrocarbyl group includes ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or mixtures thereof. When the polyurethane dispersant contains polyether side chains it is<br>
preferred that the terminating alkyl group is d-4 alkyl, for instance methyl, because of their ready commercial availability. When the organic medium is a non-polar organic liquid it is preferred that the terminating alkyl group contains greater than 8 carbon atoms. It is also preferred that the alkyl group is branched since this aids solubility in the non-polar organic liquid.<br>
The polyether chain is preferably poly(C2-4-alkylene oxide) which contains less than 60%, more preferably less than 40%, and especially less than 20% by weight ethylene oxide relative to the total weight of the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain.<br>
The alkylene moiety of the (C2-4-alkylene oxide) group may be linear or preferably branched and may be obtained by (co)polymerisation of alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide or from tetrahydrofuran. Copolymers may be random or block copolymers.<br>
Preferably, the polyether chain is obtainable from propylene oxide. It is also preferred that the polyether chain of the dispersant is obtainable from a poly(Ca-4-alkylene oxide) mono-Cuio-alkyl ether and especially a methyl or butyl ether.<br>
The polyester chain is preferably obtainable or obtained from a hydroxy carboxylic acid containing from 1 to 26 carbon atoms or a lactone thereof. The choice of hydroxy carboxylic acid is largely influenced by the nature of the organic medium itself. Where the organic medium is a polar organic liquid, the hydroxy carboxylic acid preferably contains up to 8 carbon atoms and where the organic medium is a non-polar organic liquid the hydroxy carboxylic acid preferably contains more than 8 carbon atoms. It is particularly preferred that the polyester chain is obtainable from two or more different hydroxy carboxylic acids or lactones thereof since this aids solubility in the organic medium. The hydroxy carboxylic acid may be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched.<br>
Examples of suitable hydroxy carboxylic acids are glycolic acid, lactic acid, 5-hydroxy valeric acid, 6-hydroxy caproic acid, ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxy stearic acid, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid and 4-hydroxydecanoic acid.<br>
Examples of suitable lactones are p-propiolactone and optionally C1-6-alkyl substituted 8-valerolactone and e-caprolactone such as p-methyl-8-valerolactone,<br>
5-valerolactone, e-caprolactone, 2-methyl, 3-methyl, 4-methyl, 5-tert butyl, 7-methyl-,4,4,6-trimethyl- and 4,6,6-trimethyl-e-caprolactone, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyester chains derivable from 8-valerolactone and s-caprolactone are especially preferred.<br>
The polyacrylate chains are preferably obtainable or obtained by (co)polymerising C1-6-(alk)acrylate esters and especially (meth)acrylate esters(e.g. polymers from acrylic acid (optionally C1-6 alkyl substituted) or esters from CMS (more preferably C1-8) alcohols and acrylic or C|.6 alkyl substituted acrylic acid).<br>
As disclosed hereinbefore, the polyurethane dispersants may contain mixtures of polyester, polyether and polyacrylate lateral side chains.<br>
By way of an obvious variant, the polyester, polyether and polyacrylate lateral side chains may themselves be mixtures of such chains. Thus, for example, the polyester and polyacrylate side chains may contain a polyether moiety and so on.<br>
The number-average molecular weight of the lateral polyester, polyether, polyacrylate, or polyolefin side chains in the polyurethane dispersant is preferably not greater than 10,000, more preferably not greater than 4,000 and especially not greater than 2,500. It is also preferred that the number-average molecular weight of the lateral polyester, polyether and polyacrylate side chains is not less than 300, more preferably not less than 600 and especially not less than 800.<br>
As disclosed hereinbefore, the backbone of the polyurethane is essentially linear. Therefore, the isocyanates from which the dispersant is obtainable preferably have a functionality of from 2.0 to 2.5, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.1 and especially approximately 2.0.<br>
The lateral side chain polyester, polyether, polyacrylate or polyolefin chains are connected to polyurethane backbone by oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms which are the residue of terminating hydroxy and amino (primary and secondary) groups of the polyester, polyether, polyacrylic (especially polyacrylate) or polyolefin.<br>
When the lateral side chain is a polyether it is preferably the residue of a polyether which contains either two hydroxyl groups or one hydroxyl and one secondary amino group which react with isocyanates at one end of the polyether chain. The hydroxyl and amino groups are preferably separated by up to 6 carbon<br>
atoms. When the polyether contains two hydroxyl groups which react with isocyanates they are preferably separated by up to 17 atoms, especially 16 carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. It is also preferred that the two hydroxyl groups are separated by not less than 5 atoms, especially 4 carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. It is also possible to prepare the dispersant from a polyether which contains two amino groups (i.e. primary and/or secondary amino groups) which react with isocyanates but this is less preferred.<br>
When the lateral side chain is a polyester, it is preferably the residue of the polyester which contains two hydroxyl groups at one end of the polyester chain which react with isocyanates. The hydroxyl groups are also preferably separated by up to 17 atoms, especially 16 carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. It is especially preferred that the two hydroxyl groups are separated by not less than 5 atoms.<br>
When the lateral side chain is a polyacrylate it is preferably the residue of a polyacrylate which contains two hydroxy groups at one end of the polyacrylate chain which react with isocyanates. The two hydroxyl groups are preferably separated by up to 4 carbon atoms, for example 2 carbon atoms. In one embodiment the polyacrylate is present and in another embodiment the polyacrylate is absent.<br>
When the lateral side chain is a polyolefin it is preferably the residue of a polyolefin which contains either two hydroxyl groups or one hydroxyl and one secondary amino group which react with isocyanates at one end of the polyolefin chain. The hydroxyl and amino groups are preferably separated by up to 6 carbon atoms. When the polyolefin contains two hydroxyl groups which react with isocyanates they are preferably separated by up to 17 atoms, especially 16 carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. It is also preferred that the two hydroxyl groups are separated by not less than 5 atoms, especially 4 carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom. It is also possible to prepare the dispersant from a polyolefin which contains two amino groups (i.e. primary and/or secondary amino groups) which react with isocyanates but this is less preferred.<br>
The dispersant may also optionally contain an acid and/or amino group, including salts thereof, since such groups have been found to improve the dispersibility of some particulate solids. The amount of acid and/or amino groups in the polyurethane dispersant is preferably from 10 to 180, more preferably from 20 to<br>
110 and especially from 20 to 60 milliequivalents for each 100 g polyurethane dispersant. Acid groups are preferred, especially carboxylic acid groups.<br>
When the acid group is in the form of a salt, it may be the salt of an alkali metal such as sodium, potassium or lithium, a salt of an amine such as C1-8-alkylamine or C1-8-alkanolamine or a salt of a quaternary ammonium cation such as a C1-8-alkyl quaternary ammonium cation or benzalkonium cation. The amino group may be quaternised by reaction with a dialkyl sulphate, such as dimethyl sulphate or benzyl chloride. Preferably the acid group, when present, is in the form of the free acid.<br>
When the amino group is in the form of a salt, it may be the salt of an inorganic or organic acid. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric acid and acetic acids. Preferably, the amino group, when present, is in a non-ionised form.<br>
The polyurethane dispersant may also contain the residue of formative compounds having a number average molecular weight of from 32 to 3,000 together with two groups which react with isocyanates.<br>
The polyurethane dispersant may also have terminal polyester, polyether, polyacrylate or polyolefin chains. Such chains are similar to those described hereinbefore for the lateral chains but are obtainable from compounds having only the one group which reacts with isocyanates.<br>
The total weight percentage of the solvent-soluble lateral and terminal chains in the polyurethane dispersant is preferably not less than 20%, more preferably not less than 30% and especially not less than 40%. It is also preferred that the total weight percentage of solvent-soluble lateral and terminal chains in the polyurethane dispersant is not greater than 90%, more preferably not greater than 80%, for instance 45% to 80% or 60% to 78%. In one embodiment the total weight percentage of solvent-soluble lateral and terminal chains in the polyurethane dispersant is not greater than 70%, for instance 55% to 65%.<br>
The weight percentage of solvent-soluble lateral chains in the polyurethane dispersant is preferably not less than 5%, more preferably not less than 15% and especially not less than 25% or not less than 35%.<br>
The participate solid present in the composition may be any inorganic or organic solid material which is substantially insoluble in the organic medium at the<br>
temperature concerned and which it is desired to stabilise in a finely divided form therein.<br>
Examples of suitable solids are pigments for solvent inks; pigments, extenders and fillers for paints and plastics materials; dyes, especially disperse dyes; optical brightening agents and textile auxiliaries for solvent dyebaths, inks and other solvent application systems; solids for oil-based and invert-emulsion drilling muds; dirt and solid particles in dry cleaning fluids; particulate ceramic materials; magnetic materials and magnetic recording media, fire retardants such as those used in plastics materials and biocides, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals which are applied as dispersions in organic media.<br>
A preferred particulate solid is a pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments described, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colour Index (1971) and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed "Pigments". Examples of inorganic pigments are titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Prussian blue, cadmium sulphide, iron oxides, vermilion, ultramarine and the chrome pigments, including chromates, molybdates and mixed chromates and sulphates of lead, zinc, barium, calcium and mixtures and modifications thereof which are commercially available as greenish-yellow to red pigments under the names primrose, lemon, middle, orange, scarlet and red chromes. Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, condensed azo, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthanthrone, anthraquinone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendioxazine, quinacridone and phthalocyanine series, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes. Carbon black, although strictly inorganic, behaves more like an organic pigment in its dispersing properties. Preferred organic pigments are phthalocyanines, especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthranthrones, quinacridones and carbon blacks.<br>
Other preferred particulate solids are: extenders and fillers such as talc, kaolin, silica, barytes and chalk; particulate ceramic materials such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide, mixed silicon-aluminium nitrides and metal titanates; particulate magnetic materials such as the magnetic oxides of transition metals, especially iron and chromium, e.g.<br>
gamma-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and cobalt-doped iron oxides, calcium oxide, ferrites, especially barium ferrites; and metal particles, especially metallic iron, nickel, cobalt and alloys thereof; agrochemicals such as the fungicides flutriafen, carbendazim, chlorothalonil and mancozeb and fire retardants such as aluminium trihydrate and magnesium hydroxide.<br>
The organic medium present in the composition is preferably a polar organic medium or a substantially non-polar aromatic hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon. By the term "polar" in relation to the organic medium is meant an organic liquid or resin capable of forming moderate to strong bonds as described in the article entitled "A Three Dimensional Approach to Solubility" by Crowley et al in Journal of Paint Technology, Vol. 38, 1966, at page 269. Such organic media generally have a hydrogen bonding number of 5 or more as defined in the above mentioned article.<br>
Examples of suitable polar organic liquids are amines, ethers, especially lower alkyl ethers, organic acids, esters, ketones, glycols, alcohols and amides. Numerous specific examples of such moderately strongly hydrogen bonding liquids are given in the book entitled "Compatibility and Solubility" by Ibert Mellan (published in 1968 by No yes Development Corporation) in Table 2.14 on pages 39-40 and these liquids all fall within the scope of the term polar organic liquid as used herein.<br>
Preferred polar organic liquids are dialkyl ketones, alkyl esters of alkane carboxylic acids and alkanols, especially such liquids containing up to, and including, a total of 6 carbon atoms. As examples of the preferred and especially preferred liquids there may be mentioned dialkyl and cycloalkyl ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, di-isopropyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, di-isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl n-amyl ketone and cyclohexanone; alkyl esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl formate, methyl propionate, methoxy propylacetate and ethyl butyrate; glycols and glycol esters and ethers, such as ethylene glycol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 3-methoxypropylpropanol, 3-ethoxypropylpropanol, 2-butoxyethyl acetate, 3-methoxypropyl acetate, 3-ethoxypropyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate;<br>
alkanols   such   as   methanol,   ethanol,   /z-propanol,   isopropanol,   n-butanol   and isobutanol and dialkyl and cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The substantially non-polar, organic liquids which may be used, either alone or in admixture with the aforementioned polar solvents, are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, decane, petrolium distillates such as white spirit, mineral oils, vegetable oils and halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as trichloro-ethylene, perchloroethylene and chlorobenzene.<br>
Examples of suitable polar resins, as the medium for the dispersion form of the present invention, are film-forming resins such as are suitable for the preparation of inks, paints and chips for use in various applications such as paints and inks. Examples of such resins include polyamides, such as Versamidâ„¢ and Wolfamidâ„¢, and cellulose ethers, such as ethyl cellulose and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose. Examples of paint resins include short oil alkyd/melamine-formaldehyde, polyester/melamine-formaldehyde, thermosetting acrylic/melamine-formaldehyde, long oil alkyd and multi-media resins such as acrylic and urea/aldehyde.<br>
The resin may also be an unsaturated polyester resin including the so-called sheet moulding compounds and bulk moulding compounds which may be formulated with reinforcing fibres and fillers. Such moulding compounds are described in DE 3,643,007 and the monograph by P F Bruins entitled "Unsaturated Polyester Technology", Gordon and Breach Science publishers, 1976, pages 211 to 238.<br>
If desired, the dispersions may contain other ingredients, for example resins (where these do not already constitute the organic medium) binders, fluidising agents (such as those described in GB-A-1508576 and GB-A-2108143), anti-sedimentation agents, plasticizers, levelling agents and preservatives.<br>
The composition typically contains from 5 to 95% by weight of the particulate solid, the precise quantity depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities of the solid and the organic medium. For example, a composition in which the solid is an organic material, such as an organic pigment, preferably contains from 15 to 60% by weight of the solid whereas a composition in which the solid is an inorganic material, such as an inorganic pigment, filler or extender,<br>
preferably contains from 40 to 90% by weight of the solid based on the total weight of composition.<br>
The composition is preferably prepared by milling the particulate solid in the organic medium at a temperature which is not greater than 40Â°C and especially not greater than 30Â°C. However, when the solid is a crude phthalocyanine pigment such as copper phthalocyanine, it is sometimes preferable to carry out the milling in an organic liquid at a temperature between 50 and 150Â°C since greener and brighter shades may be obtained. This is particularly the case where the organic liquid is a high boiling aliphatic and/or aromatic distillate.<br>
The composition may be obtained by any of the conventional methods known for preparing dispersions. Thus, the solid, the organic medium and the dispersant may be mixed in any order, the mixture then being subjected to a mechanical treatment to reduce the particles of the solid to an appropriate size, for example by ball milling, bead milling, gravel milling or plastic milling until the dispersion is formed. Alternatively, the solid may be treated to reduce its particle size independently or in admixture with either the organic medium or the dispersant, the other ingredient or ingredients then being added and the mixture being agitated to provide the dispersion.<br>
If the composition is required in dry form, the liquid medium is preferably volatile so that it may be readily removed from the particulate solid by a simple separation means such as evaporation. It is preferred, however, that the composition comprises the liquid medium.<br>
If the dry composition consists essentially of the dispersant and the particulate solid, it preferably contains at least 0.2%, more preferably at least 0.5% and especially at least 1.0% dispersant based on weight of the particulate solid. Preferably the dry composition contains not greater than 100%, preferably not greater than 50%, more preferably not greater than 20% and especially not greater than 10% by weight dispersant based on the weight of the particulate solid.<br>
As described hereinbefore, the compositions are particularly suitable for preparing mill-bases where the particulate solid is milled in a liquid medium in the presence of both a particulate solid and a film-forming resin binder.<br>
Thus, according to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a mill-base comprising a particulate solid, dispersant and a film-forming resin.<br>
Typically, the mill-base contains from 20 to 70% by weight particulate solid based on the total weight of the mill-base. Preferably, the particulate solid is not less than 30 and especially not less than 50% by weight of the mill-base.<br>
The amount of resin in the mill-base can vary over wide limits but is preferably not less than 10%, and especially not less than 20% by weight of the continuous/liquid phase of the mill-base. Preferably, the amount of resin is not greater than 50% and especially not greater than 40% by weight of the continuous/liquid phase of the mill-base.<br>
The amount of dispersant in the mill-base is dependent on the amount of particulate solid but is preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight of the mill-base.<br>
The polyurethane dispersants may be prepared by any method known to the art and are obtainable or obtained by reacting together:<br>
a)	one or more polyisocyanates having an average functionality of from 2.0<br>
to 2.5;<br>
b)	one  or more  compounds  having  at  least  one  polyester,  polyether,<br>
polyacrylate  or polyolefin  chain  and  at  least  two   groups  which  react  with<br>
isocyanates which are located at one end of the compound such that the polyester,<br>
polyether   or   polyacrylate   chain(s)   is   laterally   disposed   in   relation   to   the<br>
polyurethane polymer backbone;<br>
c)	optionally, one or more compounds having an acid or amino group,<br>
including salts thereof, and at least two groups which react with isocyanates;<br>
d)	optionally, one or more formative compounds having a number average<br>
molecular weight of from 32 to 3,000 which have at least two groups which react<br>
with isocyanates;<br>
e)	optionally, one or more compounds which act as chain terminators which<br>
contain one group which reacts with isocyanates;<br>
f)	optionally, one or more compounds which act as chain terminators which<br>
contain a single isocyanate group.<br>
As noted hereinbefore the polyurethane dispersants have an essentially linear backbone and consequently it is much preferred that components (b), (c) and (d) <br>
contain only two groups which react with isocyanates. It is also preferred that component (a) has a functionality of from 2.1 to 2.0 and especially about 2 since this also limits any cross-linking between chains of the polyurethane dispersants.<br>
Preferably, component (a) is a diisocyanate or mixtures of diisocyanates such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hexanediisocyanate (HDI), a,a-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), diphenylmethane-4,4 -diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI), diphenylmethane-2,4 -diisocyanate (2,4'-MDI) and dicyclohexylmethane-4,4 -diisocyanate (HMDI). Preferably, component (a) is either TDI or IPDI or MDI.<br>
The compound having a polyether chain which is component (b) is preferably<br>
poly (C3-3-alkylene oxide) which contains less than 60% poly(ethylene oxide) and also preferably contains two groups which react with isocyanates. Preferably, the amount of ethylene oxide is less than 40% and especially less than 20% by weight of the poly(C2-3-alkylene oxide) chain. There are a number of ways of incorporating a polyether lateral chain into an organic compound which contains these groups which react with isocyanates.<br>
Thus, in the case where the two groups which react with isocyanates are both hydroxyl, a poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain may be conveniently attached by isocyanates having a functionality of two or more. Compounds of this type are described in US 4,794,147, which involves sequentially reacting a mono-functional polyether with a polyisocyanate to produce a partially capped isocyanate intermediate and reacting the intermediate with a compound having at least one active amino hydrogen and at least two active hydroxyl groups.<br>

However, it is preferred that component (d) is difunctional. Preferred reactive groups are amino and hydroxy and it is much preferred that component (d) is a diamine or especially a diol. Component (d), if present, is used primarily as a chain extender to alter the solubility of the polyurethane polymer.<br>
<br>
Examples of suitable diamines are ethylene diamine, 1, 4-butane diamine and 1,6-hexanediamine.<br>

The polyalkylene glycol may be a random or block (co)polymer containing repeat ethyleneoxy, propyleneoxy or butyleneoxy groups, including mixtures thereof.<br>
As noted hereinbefore, it is preferred that the polyurethane polymer backbone is essentially linear in character.

monofunctional polyether, polyester or poly(alk)acrylate the amount of component (b) is preferably not less than 35%.<br>
The polyurethane polymers according to the invention may be prepared by any method known to the art. Typically, the polyurethane polymer is obtainable or obtained by reacting one or more isocyanates having a functionality of from 2.0 to 2.5 (component (a)) with one or more compounds selected from polyethers having a poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain, polyester, polyacrylic, or polyolefin, each characterized by having at least two groups which react with isocyanates which are located at one end (component (b)) under substantially anhydrous conditions and in an inert atmosphere which is typically a temperature between 0 and 130Â°C, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent and optionally in the presence of a catalyst. Optionally, the reaction may also be carried out in the presence of one or more compounds having at least one acid or amine group (component (c)) and one or more formative compounds acting as chain extenders (component (d)) and optionally one or more compounds which act as chain terminating compounds which are components (e) and (f).<br>
The inert atmosphere may be provided by any of the inert gases of the Periodic Table but is preferably nitrogen.<br>
The preparation of the polyurethane polymer/prepolymer may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst. Particularly preferred catalysts are tin complexes of aliphatic acids such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) and tertiary amines.<br>
The essential feature of the polyurethane polymer according to the invention is that it comprises a predominantly linear polyurethane polymer backbone containing the defined amount of lateral polymeric side chains which may poly (alkylene oxide), polyester, poly(alk)acrylate or polyolefin. There will thus be many variants which will be obvious to the skilled addressee regarding the ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate reactive groups including the formulation of prepolymers which have residual isocyanate functionality. In one case, the ratio of total isocyanate groups provided by component (a) is less than the total number of isocyanate reactive groups provided by component (b) and components (c) (d) and (e) when present. Any terminal isocyanate reactive groups may be reacted.<br>
Alternatively, the ratio of total number of isocyanate groups provided by component (a) and optionally component (f) is greater that the total number of isocyanate reactive groups provided by component (b) and components (c), (d) and (e) when present. The resultant polyurethane is then a prepolymer containing residual isocyanate functionality. This prepolymer may then be reacted with other chain extenders such as component (d) which conjoins different prepolymer chains and/or with chain terminating compounds which are component (e), optionally prior to or during dissolution in water or other polar solvent. In one embodiment prepolymer is reacted with chain extenders prior to dissolution in water or other polar solvent. In one embodiment prepolymer is reacted with chain extenders during dissolution in water or other polar solvent. In one embodiment prepolymer is reacted with chain extenders prior to dissolution in the absence of water or other polar solvent. In one embodiment the prepolymer may be reacted with chain extenders in the absence of water.<br>
The preparation of prepolymers can be useful since it is a means of controlling viscosity during the preparation of the polyurethane polymer, especially in circumstances where the reaction is carried out in the absence of any solvent.<br>
When a prepolymer is formed which contains isocyanate functionality, chain extension may be carried out by water itself, or a polyol, amino-alcohol, a primary or secondary aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, araliphatic or heterocyclic polyamine especially a diamine, hydrazine or a substituted hydrazine.<br>
Examples of suitable chain extenders include ethylenediamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, propylenediamine, butylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, cyclohexylenediamine, piperazine, 2-methyl piperazine, phenylenediamine, tolylene diamine, xylylene diamine, tris (2-aminoethy)amine, 3,3'-dinitrobenzidine, 4,4'methylenebis (2-chloraniline), 3,3'-dichloro-4, 4'bi-phenyl diamine, 2,6-diaminopyridine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, methane diamine, m-xylene diamine, isophorone diamine, and adducts of diethylene triamine with acrylate or its hydrolyzed products. Also materials such as hydrazine, azines such as acetone azine, substituted hydrazines such as, for example, dimethyl hydrazine, 1,6-hexamethylene-bis-hydrazine, carbodihydreazine, hydrazides of dicarboxylic acids and sulphonic acid such as adipic acid mono- or dihydrazide,<br>
xalic acid dihydrazide, isophthalic acid dihydrazide, tartaric acid dihydrazide, 1,3-phenylene disulphonic acid dihydrazide, omega-aminocaproic acid dihydrazide, hydrazides made by reacting lactones with hydrazide such as gamma-hydroxylbutyric hydrazide, bis-semi-carbazide carbonic esters of glycols such as any of the glycols mentioned above. Hexamethylenediamine is especially preferred.<br>
The chain extension can be conducted at elevated, reduced or ambient temperatures. Convenient temperatures are from about 5Â°C to 95Â°C.<br>
When employing a prepolymer in the preparation of the polyurethane polymer, the amount of chain extender and chain terminating compound are chosen to control the molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer. A high molecular weight will be favoured when the number of isocyanate-reactive groups in the chain extender is approximately equivalent to the number of free isocyanate groups in the prepolymer. A lower molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer is favoured by using a combination of chain extender and chain terminator in the reaction with the polyurethane prepolymer.<br>
An inert solvent may be added before, during or after formation of the polyurethane polymer/prepolymer in order to control viscosity. Examples of suitable solvents are acetone, methylethylketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, diglyme, N-methylpyrrolidone, butylacetate, methoxypropyl acetate, ethylacetate, ethylene and propylene glycoldiacetates, alkyl ethers of ethylene and propylene glycol acetates, toluene, xylene and sterically hindered alcohols such as t-butanol and diacetone alcohol. Preferred solvents are ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methoxy propylacetate and N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
The number average molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer is preferably not less than 2,000, more preferably not less than 3,000 and especially not less than 4,000. It is also preferred that the number average molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer is not greater than 50,000, more preferably not greater than 30,000 and especially not greater than 20,000.<br>

In one preferred sub-group of such dispersants, the poly(C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain is the residue of a polyether which contains one hydroxyl and one imino (secondary amine) group at one end of the polyether chain which reacts with isocyanates. In a second preferred sub-group of polyether dispersants the poly(C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain is the residue of a polyether which contains two hydroxyl groups at one end of the polyether chain which react with isocyanates and which are separated by not less than 5 atoms.<br>
