The lower frame section 13b is comprised of a horizontal portion 13ba substantially horizontally extending rearwardly from the lower end of the down-frame section 13a and an inclined portion 13bb inclined rearwardly and upwardly from a rear end of the horizontal portion 13ba.<br>
The connecting frame 17 is disposed above the lower frame sections 13b of both the side frames 13 and below the floor 26. This connecting frame is comprised of a U-shaped section 32 which is formed in a substantially “U” shape in plan view, and has a closed front end and rear ends connected to the inclined portions 13bb in the down-frame sections 13b of both the side frames 13, and a support section 33 which connects the vicinity of a widthwise middle portion of the front end of the U-shaped section 32 to connected portions between the down-frame sections 13a and lower frame sections 13b in both the side frames 13. In this embodiment, the U-shaped section 32 has a smaller diameter than the side frames 13, and is formed by bending a single pipe member, and the support section 33, which is composed of a pair of right and left pipe members 34 and 34, connects two spots in the vicinity of the widthwise middle portion of the front end of the U-shaped section 32 to the connected portions between the down-frame sections 13a and the lower frame sections 13b.<br>
In side view, the lower frame section 13b in each side<br><br>
frame 13 and the U-shaped section 32 formed to have a smaller diameter than the side frame 13 and disposed above the lower frame section 13b are disposed such that they are juxtaposed vertically in a pair.<br>
The center frame 14, which has a laterally long rectangular cross-sectional shape whose width Wl (see Fig. 4) in the width direction of the vehicle is larger that a width W2 (see Fig. 2) in the forward and backward directions of the vehicle, may be made of an angled cylindrical pipe or may be molded of cast iron. A lower end of the center frame 14 whose upper portion is connected to the main pipe 15 is joined to the widthwise middle portion of the front end of the U-shaped section 32 in the connecting frame 17 . In side view, the down-frame section 13a of each side frame 13 and the U-shaped section 32 made of a pipe member having a smaller diameter than the down-frame section 13a are disposed in front of the floor 26 such that they are juxtaposed back and forth in a pair.<br>
A pair of right and left rear sub-frames 18 at least parts of which are disposed behind the rising frame sections 13c is attached to both the side frames 13. In this embodiment, each rear sub-frame 18 is disposed below the lower frame section 13b of each side frame 13 and behind the rising frame section 13c. A front end of the rear sub-frame 18 is joined to a rear face of a front end of the inclined portion 13bb in the lower frame section 13b in front of a joined portion of the U-shaped section 32 in the connecting frame 17, and a rear end of the rear sub-frame 18 is joined to a bottom face in the vicinity<br><br>
of a front portion of the seat frame section 13d in the side frame 13.<br>
Moreover, intermediate portions of both the rear sub-frames 18 are bent so as to approach the rising frame sections 13c of the side frames 13. Pivot plates 36 are provided between both the side frames 13 and both the rear sub-frames 18, respectively, below the bent intermediate portions.<br>
Each rear sub-frame 18 is made of a pipe member having a smaller diameter that the side frame 13. In side view, the lower frame section 13b and rising frame section 13c in the side frame 13 and the rear sub-frame 18 made of a pipe member having a small diameter are disposed such that they are juxtaposed in a pair below and behind the floor 26.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 1, a radiator 37 is disposed between the down-frame sections 13a of both the side frames 13 and the center frame 14. A top face of the floor 26 is set to a position lower than a vertical center position CP of the radiator 37.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 4, a pair of right and left support arms 38 provided in an upper portion of the radiator 37 is elastically supported by a pair of right and left stays 39 provided in the front cross main bar 16. Also, both right and left ends of a guard pipe 40 which covers a lower portion of the radiator 37 from its front side are respectively joined to front faces of lower ends of the down-frame sections 13a in both the side frames 13. A lower middle portion of the radiator 37 is elastically supported by a stay 41 directed<br><br>
toward a middle portion of the guard pipe 40.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, a support plate 43 is secured to the connected portion between the lower floor section 13b and the rising frame section 13c in each side frame 13 so as to protrude rearwardly. A lower portion of the engine E in the power unit P is provided with a bracket 44.<br>
In addition, the link mechanism 42 includes a pair of right and left first link arms 46 which is rotatably supported by the pivot plates 36 via a body-frame-side pivot shaft 45, a second link arm 48 whose one end is rotatably connected to the other end of each of the first link arms 46 via a connecting shaft 47, a power-unit-side pivot shaft 49 which is fixed to the other end of the second link arm 48 and rotatably supported by the bracket 44, an upwardly extending regulating arm 51 whose one end is connected to the power-unit-side pivot shaft 49 and whose intermediate portion is rotatably supported by each support plate 43 via a pivot 50, and an elastic member 52 mounted on the other end of the regulating arm 51. The rotation of the regulating arm is regulated between a position where the elastic member 52 comes into a resilient contact with a lower rear face of the rising frame section 13c in each side frame 13 and a position where the elastic member 49 comes into a resilient contact with a regulating plate 43a provided in each support plate 43 from the front side.<br>
Moreover, the body-frame-side pivot shaft 45 of the link mechanism 42 is disposed in front of the rear face of the rising frame section 13c in the side frame 13. The power-unit-side<br><br>
pivot shaft 49, as shown in Fig. 1, is disposed within an imaginary circular arc C passing through the center of rotation of the front wheel WF about the hand grip 22, on a projection view drawn by projecting the vehicle onto a plane orthogonal to a rotation axis of the front wheel WF.<br>
Next, the operation of the first embodiment will be described. The body frame FA includes the pair of right and left side frames 13, each having the down-frame section 13a suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 and the lower frame section 13b extending rearwardly from the lower end of the down-frame section 13a, the center frame 14 suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 between both the side frames 13, and the connecting frame 17 which is disposed above the lower floor sections 13b to reinforce the center frame 14 and both the side frames 13, and the connecting frame 17 is disposed below the low-floor-type floor 26. Accordingly, the lower frame sections 13b of both the side frames 13 are set to sufficiently lower positions, and the connecting frame 17 which reinforces both the side frames 13 and the center frame 14 suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 between both the side frames 13 are disposed above the lower floor sections 13b and below the floor 26. As a result, the flat floor 26 that sufficiently ensures a footrest space is formed, thereby improving usability, and the balance between the longitudinal rigidity and torsional rigidity of the body frame FA can be improved.<br>
In addition, such effects can be achieved not only by the connecting frame 17 having the U-shaped section 32 and<br><br>
the support section 33 but also by a connecting frame adapted to linearly connect rear portions of the lower frame sections 13b of the side frames 13 to the down-frame sections 13a in a substantially horizontal plane.<br>
Moreover, since the center frame 13 has a laterally long rectangular cross-sectional shape, it is possible to increase the rigidity of the center frame 14 while easily ensuring the backward and rearward installation space for the center frame 14 to be disposed in front of the floor 26.<br>
Besides, the connecting frame 17 has the U-shaped section 32 which is formed in a substantially “U” shape in plan view, and has a closed front end and rear ends connected to both the side frames 13, and the support section 33 which connects the vicinity of a widthwise middle portion of the front end of the U-shaped section 32 to the side frames 13. Thus, the flat floor 26 that sufficiently ensures a footrest space while ensuring a sufficient rigidity is formed, thereby improving usability, and the torsional rigidity of the body frame FA can be adjusted.<br>
In addition, such effects can be achieved even if the center frame 14 is omitted.<br>
Further, the gusset 31 is provided between the head pipe 12 and the main pipe 15 suspended from the head pipe 12, and the upper ends of the down-frame sections 13a of both the side frames 13 are joined to both the head pipe 12 and the gusset 31. As a result, the rigidity of joint between both the side frames 13 and the head pipe 12 can be increased. Also, since<br><br>
the upper portion of the center frame 14 is connected to the main pipe 15, the rigidity of the upper portion of the center frame 14 can be increased.<br>
Moreover, each side frame 13 integrally has the down-frame section 13a suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12, the lower floor section 13b connected to the lower end of the down-frame section 13a and extending rearwardly below the floor 26, the rising frame section 13c connected to the rear end of the lower frame section 13b and rising upwardly behind the floor 26, and the seat rail section 13d extending rearwardly from the upper end of the rising frame section 13c. The side frame is obtained by bending and forming a single pipe. As a result, the number of parts can be reduced, and the number of assembling processes of the body frame FA can be reduced.<br>
Moreover, the side frames 13, the center frame 14 having a smaller diameter than the side frames 13 and reinforcing the side frames 13, the U-shaped section 32 of the connecting frame 17, and the rear-sub frames 18 are disposed such that they are juxtaposed in pairs in front of, below, and behind the floor 26, in side view. Thus, the lightweight and high-rigidity body frame FA can be constructed.<br>
Further, the radiator 37 is disposed between the down-frame sections 13a of both the side frames 13 and the center frame 14. Accordingly, by increasing the vertical length of the radiator 37 while expanding the space of the flat floor 26, the capacity of the radiator 37 can be increased, thereby improving the coolingperformance for the engine E. In addition,<br><br>
since the top face of the floor 26 is set to a position below the vertical center position CP of the radiator 37, the position of the floor 26 can be set as near to the bottom as possible, thereby improving the property that a rider gets on/out of the vehicle.<br>
Moreover, the pair of right and left rear sub-frames 18 at least parts of which are disposed behind the rising frame sections 13c is attached to both the side frames 13, and the body-frame-side pivot shaft 45 of the link mechanism 42 provided between the body frame FA and the power unit P is supposed by the pivot plates 36 provided between both the side frames 13 and both the rear sub-frames 18. Thus, it is possible to increase the rigidity around the body-frame-side pivot shaft 45 while avoiding increasing the size of the side frames 13. By avoiding increasing the size of the side frame 13 in this way, the rear space of the floor 26 can be increased.<br>
Moreover, since the body-frame-side pivot shaft 45 of the link mechanism 42 is disposed in front of the rear face of the rising frame section 13c, the body-frame-side pivot shaft 45 of the link mechanism 42 can be disposed as near to the front as possible, thereby shortening the wheelbase.<br>
Further, sine the intermediate portions of both the rear sub-frames 18 are bent so as to approach the rising frame sections 13c of the side frames 13, the power unit P can be disposed on the front side while avoiding interference of the power unit P with the rear sub-frames 18, thereby making the wheelbase shorter.<br><br>
Moreover, the power-unit-side pivot shaft 49 of the link mechanism 42 is disposed within the imaginary circular arc C passing through the center of rotation of the front wheel WF about the handgrip 22, on a projection view drawn by projecting the vehicle onto a plane orthogonal to the rotation axis of the front wheel WF. As a result, the power-unit-side pivot shaft 49 of the link mechanism 42 can be disposed as near to the front as possible, thereby further shortening the wheelbase.<br>

Each rear sub-frame 61 is made of a pipe member having a smaller diameter that the side frame 53. In side view, the lower frame section 53b and rising frame section 53c in the side frame 53 and the rear sub-frame 61 made of a pipe member having a small diameter are disposed such that they are juxtaposed in a pair below and behind the floor 26.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 6, a radiator 37 is disposed between the down-frame sections 53a of both the side frames<br><br>
13 and the center frame 54. A top face of the floor 2 6 is set to a position lower than a vertical center position CP of the radiator 37.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 9, a pair of right and left support arms 38 provided in an upper portion of the radiator 37 is elastically supported by a pair of right and left stays 65 provided in the front cross main bar 57. Also, both right and left ends of a guard pipe 40 which covers a lower portion of the radiator 37 from its front side are respectively joined to front faces of lower ends of the down-frame sections 53a in both the side frames 53. A lower middle portion of the radiator 37 is elastically supported by a stay 41 directed toward a middle portion of the guard pipe 40.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, a support plate 67 is secured to the connected portion between the lower floor section 53b and the rising frame section 53c in each side frame 13 so as to protrude rearwardly. A lower portion of the engine E in the power unit P is provided with a bracket 44.<br>
In addition, the link mechanism 72 includes a pair of right and left first link arms 74 which is rotatably supported by the pivot plates 64 via a body-frame-side pivot shaft 73, a second link arm 76 whose one end is rotatably connected to the other end of each of the first link arms 74 via a connecting shaft 75, a power-unit-side pivot shaft 77 which is fixed to the other end of the second link arm 76 and rotatably supported by the bracket 44, an arm 79 which is located outside one second link arm 7 6 of both the second link arms 76, which is located<br><br>

An intermediate portion of the regulating arm 81 is connected to each support plate 67 via a rubber bush 82 and a connecting shaft 83.<br>
Moreover, an upwardly protruding regulating protrusion<br>
84	is integrally provided in the regulating arm 81, and a recess<br>
85	is provided in the support plate 67 for receiving the regulating protrusion 84. The rotation of the regulating arm 81 around the axis of the pivot 80 is regulated to a range within which the regulating protrusion 84 can move within the recess 85.<br>
Moreover, the body-frame-side pivot shaft 73 of the link mechanism 72 is disposed in front of the rear face of the rising frame section 53c in the side frame 53. The power-unit-side pivot shaft 77, as shown in Fig. 6, is disposed within an imaginary circular arc C passing through the center of rotation of the front wheel WF about the hand grip 22, on a projection view drawn by projecting the vehicle onto a plane orthogonal to a rotation axis of the front wheel WF.<br>
Next, the operation of the second embodiment will be described. The body frame FB includes the pair of right and left side frames 53, each having the down-frame section 53a<br><br>
suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 and the lower frame section 53b extending rearwardly from the lower end of the down-frame section 53a, the center frame 54 suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 between both the side frames 53, the pair of right and left connecting frames 55 having their front ends connected to the down-frame sections 53a above the lower floor sections 53b of both the side frames 53 and having their rear ends connected to the lower frame sections 53b, the support stay 56 which connects the lower frame sections 53b of both the side frames 53 to each other, and the center frame 54 suspended downwardly through vicinities of front portions of the side frames 53 from the head pipe 12 between both the side frames<br>
53	and having its lower end connected to the support stay 56, and the connecting frames 55 are disposed below the low-floor-type floor 26. Accordingly, the lower frame sections 53b of both the side frames 53 are set to sufficiently lower positions, and the support stay 56 and the connecting frames 55 which reinforce both the side frames 53 and the center frame<br>
54	suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12 between both the side frames 53 are disposed above the lower floor sections 53b and below the floor 26. As a result, the flat floor 26 that sufficiently ensures a footrest space is formed, thereby improving usability, and the balance between the longitudinal rigidity and torsional rigidity of the body frame FB can be improved.<br>
Moreover, each side frame 53 integrally has the down-frame section 53a suspended downwardly from the head pipe 12, the<br><br>
lower floor section 53b connected to the lower end of the down-frame section 53a and extending rearwardly below the floor 26, the rising frame section 53c connected to the rear end of the lower frame section 53b and rising upwardly behind the floor 2 6, and the seat rail section 53d extending rearwardly from the upper end of the rising frame section 53c. The side frame is obtained by bending and forming a single pipe. As a result, the number of parts can be reduced, and the number of assembling processes of the body frame FB can be reduced.<br>
Moreover, the side frames 53, the center frame 54 having a smaller diameter than the side frames 53, and the rear-sub frames 61 are disposed such that they are juxtaposed in pairs in front of, below, and behind the floor 2 6, in side view. Thus, the lightweight and high-rigidity body frame FB can be constructed.<br>
Further, the radiator 37 is disposed between the down-frame sections 53a of both the side frames 53 and the center frame 54. Accordingly, by increasing the vertical length of the radiator 37 while expanding the space of the flat floor 26, the capacity of the radiator 37 can be increased, thereby improving the coolingperf ormance for the engine E. In addition, since the top face of the floor 26 is set to a position below the vertical center position CP of the radiator 37, the position of the floor 26 can be set as near to the bottom as possible, thereby improving the property that a rider gets on/out of the vehicle.<br>
Moreover, the pair of right and left rear sub-frames 61<br><br>
at least parts of which are disposed behind the rising frame sections 53c is attached to both the side frames 53, and the body-frame-side pivot shaft 73 of the link mechanism 72 provided between the body frame FB and the power unit P is supposed by the pivot plates 64 provided between both the side frames 53 and both the rear sub-frames 61. Thus, it is possible to increase the rigidity around the body-frame-side pivot shaft 73 while avoiding increasing the size of the side frames 53. By avoiding increasing the size of the side frame 52 in this way, the rear space of the floor 26 can be increased.<br>
Moreover, since the body-frame-side pivot shaft 73 of the link mechanism 72 is disposed in front of the rear face of the rising frame section 53c, the body-frame-side pivot shaft 73 of the link mechanism 72 can be disposed as near to the front as possible, thereby shortening the wheelbase.<br>
Further, sine the intermediate portions of both the rear sub-frames 61 are bent so as to approach the rising frame sections 53c of the side frames 53, the power unit P can be disposed on the front side while avoiding interference of the power unit P with the rear sub-frames 61, thereby making the wheelbase shorter.<br>
Moreover, the power-unit-side pivot shaft 77 of the link mechanism 42 is disposed within the imaginary circular arc C passing through the center of rotation of the front wheel WF about the hand grip 22, on a pro j ection view drawn by pro j ecting the vehicle onto a plane orthogonal to the rotation axis of the front wheel WF. As a result, the power-unit-side pivot<br><br>
shaft 77 of the link mechanism 42 can be disposed as near to the front as possible, thereby further shortening the wheelbase.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
