MATSUHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL CO. LTD., 1006, Oaza Kadoma, Kadoma-shi, Osaka 571-8501, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
2F04017—PCT<br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
SPEECH CODING APPARATUS, SPEECH DECODING APPARATUS AND<br>
METHODS THEREOF <br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a speech coding apparatus, speech decoding apparatus and methods thereof used in communication systems for coding and transmitting   speech and/or sound signals.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the fields of digital wireless communications, packet    communications    typified    by    Internet<br>
    communications, and speech storage and so forth, techniques for coding/decoding speech signals are indispensable in order to efficiently use the transmission channel capacity of radio signal and storage medium, and many speech coding/decoding schemes have been<br>
    developed. Among the systems, the CELP speech coding/decoding scheme has been put into practical use as a mainstream technique.<br>
A CELP type speech coding apparatus encodes input speech based on speech models stored beforehand. More<br>
   specifically, the CELP speech coding apparatus divides a digitalized speech signal into frames of about 20 ms, performs linear prediction analysis of the speech signal<br>
2<br><br>
2F04017-PCT	<br>
on a frame-by-frame basis, obtains linear prediction coefficients and linear prediction residual vector, and encodes separately the linear prediction coefficients and linear prediction residual vector. 5 In order to execute low-bit rate communications, since the amount of speech models to be stored is limited, phonation speech models are chiefly stored in the conventional CELP type speech coding/decoding scheme. In communication systems for transmitting packets<br>
 such as Internet communications, packet losses occur depending on the state of the network, and it is preferable that speech and sound can be decoded from part of remaining coded information even when part of the coded information is lost.   Similarly,  in variable rate communication<br>
    systems for varying the bit rate according to the communication capacity, when the communication capacity is decreased, it is desiredthat loads onthe communicat ion capacity can be reduced at ease by transmitting only part of the coded information.  Thus, as a technique enabling<br>
    decoding of speech and sound using all the coded information or part of the coded information, attention has recently been directed toward the scalable coding technique. Some scalable coding schemes are disclosed conventionally.<br>
    The scalable coding system is generally comprised of a base layer and enhancement layer, and the layers constitute a hierarchical structure with the base layer<br>
3<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT<br>
being the lowest layer.  In each layer, a residual signal<br>
is coded that is a difference between an input signal<br>
and output signal in a lower layer.  According to this<br>
constitution, it is possible to decode speech and/or sound<br>
  signals using the coded information of all the layers<br>
or using only the coded information of a lower layer.<br>
However , in the convent ional scalable coding system ,<br>
the CELP type speech coding/decoding system is used as<br>
the coding schemes for the base layer and enhancement<br>
  layers, and considerable amounts are thereby required<br>
both in calculation and coded information.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention<br>
 to provide a speech coding apparatus, speech decoding apparatus and methods thereof enabling scalable coding to be implemented with small amounts of calculation and coded information.<br>
The above-noted object is achieved by providing an<br>
     enhancement layer to perform long term prediction, performing long term prediction of the residual signal in the enhancement layer using a long term correlation characteristic of speech or sound to improve the quality of the decoded signal, obtaining a long term prediction<br>
    lag using long term prediction information of a base layer, and thereby reducing the computation amount.<br>

    in an enhancement layer in a two layer speech coding/decoding method comprised of a base layer and the enhancement layer. However, the invent ion is not limited in layer structure, and applicable to any cases of performing long term prediction in an upper layer using<br>
    long term prediction information of a lower layer in a hierarchical speech coding/decoding method with three or more layers. A hierarchical speech coding method refers to a method in which a plurality of speech coding methods for coding a residual signal (difference between an input<br>
    signal of a lower layer and a decoded signal of the lower layer) by long term predict ion to output coded information exist in upper layers and constitute a hierarchical structure. Further, a hierarchical speech decoding method refers to a method in which a plurality of speech<br>
   decoding methods for decoding a residual signal exists in an upper layer and constitutes a hierarchical structure Herein, a speech/sound coding/decoding method existing<br>

decoding method, and outputs a base layer decoded signal obtained by the decoding , to adding sect ion 1 0 3 . Further, base layer decoding section 102 outputs the pitch lag to enhancement layer coding section 104 as long term  prediction information of the base layer.<br>
The "long term prediction information" is information indicating long term correlation of the speech or sound signal . The "pitch lag" refers to position information specified by the base layer, and will be<br>
  described later in detail.<br>
Adding section 103 inverts the polarity of the base layer decoded signal output from base layer decoding section 102 to add to the input signal, and outputs a residual signal as a result of the addition to enhancement<br>
  layer coding section 104.<br>

 section 103, codes the long term predict ion coefficients, and outputs enhancement layer coded information obtained by coding to multiplexing section 105.<br>

via a transmission channel.<br>
Demultiplexing section 151 demultiplexes the multiplexed information transmitted from speech coding apparatus 100 into the base layer coded information and  enhancement layer coded information, and outputs the demultiplexed base layer coded information to base layer decoding section 152, while outputting the demultiplexed enhancement layer coded information to enhancement layer decoding section 153.<br>

The internal configuration of base layer coding section 101 of FIG. 1 will be describedbelowwith reference to the block diagram of FIG.2.<br>
An input signal of base layer coding section 101 5 is input to pre-processing section 200. Pre-processing section 200 performs high-pass filtering processing to remove the DC component, waveform shaping processing and pre-emphasis processing to improve performance of subsequent coding processing, and outputs a signal (Xin)  subjected to the processing, to LPC analyzing section 201 and adder 204.<br>
LPC analyzing section 201 performs linear predictive analysis using Xin, and outputs a result of the analysis (linear prediction coefficients) to LPC quantizing  section 202. LPC quantizing section 202 performs quantization processing on the linear prediction coefficients (LPC) output from LPC analyzing sect ion 201, and outputs quantized LPC to synthesis filter 203, while outputting code (L) representing the quantized LPC, to 20  multiplexing section 213.<br>
       Synthesis filter 203 generates a synthesized signal by performing filter synthesis on an excitation vector output from adding section 210 described later using filter coefficients based on the quantized LPC,  and  outputs the synthesized signal to adder 204.<br>
Adder 204 inverts the polarity of the synthesized signal, adds the resulting signal to Xin, calculates an<br>
10<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT	<br>
error signal, and outputs the error signal to perceptual weighting section 211.<br>
Adaptive excitation codebook 205 has excitation vector signals output earlier from adder 210 stored in  a buffer, and fetches a sample corresponding to one frame from an earlier excitation vector signal sample specified by a signal output from parameter determining section 212 to output to multiplier 208.<br>
Quantization gain generating section 206 outputs  an adaptive excitation gain and fixed excitation gain specified by a signal output from parameter determining section 212 respectively to multipliers 208 and 209.<br>
Fixed excitation codebook 207 multiplies a pulse<br>
excitation vector having a shape specified by the signal<br>
  output from parameter determining section 212 by a spread<br>
vector, and outputs the obtained fixed excitation vector<br>
to multiplier 209.<br>
Multiplier 208 multiplies the quantizat ion adaptive excitation gain output from quantization gain generating  section 206 by the adaptive excitation vector output from adaptive excitation codebook 205 and outputs the result to adder 210. Multiplier 209 multiplies the quantization fixed excitation gain output from quantization gain generating section 206 by the fixed excitation vector  output from fixed excitation codebook 207 and outputs the result to adder 210.<br>
Adder 210 receives the adaptive excitation vector<br>
11<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT	<br>
and fixed excitation vector both multiplied by the gain respectively input from multipliers 208 and 209 to add in vector, and outputs an excitation vector as a result of the addition to synthesis filter 203 and adaptive 5 excitation codebook 205. In addition, the excitation vector input to adaptive excitation codebook 205 is stored in the buffer.<br>
Perceptual   weighting   section   211   performs perceptual weight ing on the error signal output from adder<br>
  204, and calculates a distortion between Xin and the<br>
synthesized signal in a perceptual weighting region and<br>
outputs the result to parameter determining section 212 .<br>
Parameter  determining  section  212  selects  the<br>
adaptive excitation vector, fixed excitation vector and<br>
 quantization gain that minimize the coding distortion output from perceptual weighting section211 respectively from adaptive excitation codebook 205, fixed excitation codebook 207 and quantization gain generating section 206, and outputs adaptive excitation vector code (A),<br>
  excitation gain code (G) and fixed excitation vector code<br>
(F)  representing  the  result  of  the  selection  to<br>
multiplexing section 213.  In addition,  the adaptive<br>
excitation vector code (A) is code corresponding to the<br>
pitch lag.<br>
 Multiplexing section 213 receives the code (L) representing quantized LPC from LPC quantizing section 202,  further receives the code  (A)  representing the<br>
12<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT	<br>
adaptive excitation vector, the code (F) representing the fixed excitation vector and the code (G) representing the quantization gain from parameter determining section 212 , and multiplexes these pieces of information to output 5  as base layer coded information.<br>
The  foregoing  is explanations of  the  internal<br>
configuration of base layer coding section 101 of FIG.l.<br>
With reference to FIG.3, the processing will briefly<br>
be described below for parameter determining section 212<br>
    to determine a signal to be generated from adaptive excitationcodebook205. In FIG.3, buffer 301 isthebuffer provided in adaptive excitation codebook 205, position 302 is a fetching position for the adaptive excitation vector, and vector 303 is a fetched adaptive excitation<br>
 vector. Numeric values "41" and "296" respectively correspond to the lower limit and the upper limit of a range in which fetching position 302 is moved.<br>
The range for moving fetching position 302 is set at a range with a length of "256" (for example, from "41"<br>
 to "296") , assuming that the number of bits assigned to the code (A) representing the adaptive excitation vector is "8." The range for moving fetching position 302 can be set arbitrarily.<br>
Parameter determining section 212 moves fetching<br>
 position 302 in the set range, and fetches adaptive excitation vector 303 by the frame length from each position. Then, parameter determining sect ion 2 12 obtains<br>
13<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT	<br>
fetching position 302 that minimizes the coding distortion output from perceptual weighting section 211. Fetching position 302 in the buffer thus obtained by parameter determining section 212 is the "pitch lag" .  The internal configuration of base layer decoding section 102 (152) of FIG.l will be described below with reference to FIG.4.<br>
In FIG.4, the base layer coded information input to base layer decoding section 102 (152) is demultiplexed<br>
    to separate codes (L, A, GandF) by demultiplexing sect ion 401. The demultiplexed LPC code (L) is output to LPC decoding section 402, the demultiplexed adaptive excitation vector code (A) is output to adaptive excitation codebook 405, the demultiplexed excitation<br>
   gain code (G) is output to quantization gain generating section 406, and the demultiplexed fixed excitation vector code (F) is output to fixed excitation codebook 407 .<br>
LPC decoding section 402 decodes the LPC from the<br>
 code (L) output from demultiplexing section 401 and outputs the result to synthesis filter 403.<br>
Adaptive excitation codebook 405 fetches a sample corresponding to one frame from a past excitation vector signal sample designated by the code (A) output from<br>
  demultiplexing section 401 as an excitation vector and outputs the excitation vector to multiplier 408.  Further, adaptive excitation codebook 405 outputs the pitch lag<br>
14<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT	<br>
as the long term prediction information to enhancement layer coding section 104 (enhancement layer decoding section 153) .<br>
Quantization gain generating section 406 decodes   an adaptive excitation vector gain and fixed excitation vector gain designated by the excitation gain code (G) output from demultiplexing section 401 respectively and output the results to multipliers 408 and 409.<br>
Fixed excitation codebook 407 generates a fixed   excitation vector designated by the code (F) output from demultiplexing section 401 and outputs the result to adder 409 .<br>
Multiplier 408 multiplies the adaptive excitation<br>
vector by the adaptive excitation vector gain and outputs<br>
  the result to adder 410. Multiplier 409 multiplies the<br>
fixed excitation vector by the fixed excitation vector<br>
gain and outputs the result to adder 410.<br>
Adder 410 adds the adaptive excitation vector and fixed excitation vector both multiplied by the gain  respectively output from multipliers 408 and 409, generates an excitation vector, and outputs this excitation vector to synthesis filter 403 and adaptive excitation codebook 405.<br>
Synthesis filter 4 03 performs filter synthesis using<br>
  the excitation vector output  from adder 410  as  an<br>
excitation  signal  and  further  using  the  filter<br>
coefficients decoded in LPC decoding section 402, and<br>
15<br><br>
2F04017-PCT<br><br><br><br>
outputs a synthesized signal to post-processing section 404 .<br>
Post-processing section 404 performs on the signal output from synthesis filter 403 processing for improving  subjective quality of speech such as formant emphasis and pitch emphasis and other processing for improving subjective quality of stationary noise to output as a base layer decoded signal.<br>
The  foregoing is explanations of  the  internal<br>
 configuration of base layer decoding section 102 (152) of FIG.1.<br>
The internal configuration of enhancement layer coding section 104 of FIG.l will be described below with reference to FIG.5.<br>
 Enhancement layer coding section 104 divides the residual signal into segments of N samples (N is a natural number), and performs coding for each frame assuming N samples as one frame. Hereinafter, the residual signal is represented by e(0) ~ e(X-l), and frames subject to<br>
 coding is represented by e(n) ~ e(n + N-l) . Herein, X is a length of the residual signal, and N corresponds to the length of the frame, n is a sample positioned at the beginning of each frame, and corresponds to an integral multiple of N. In addition, the method of predicting a<br>
 signal of some frame from previously generated signals is called long term prediction. A filter for performing long term prediction is called pitch filter, comb filter<br>
16<br><br>
2F04017-PCT<br>
and   the   1ike.<br>
In FIG.5, long term prediction lag instructing section 501 receives long term prediction information t obtained in base layer decoding section 102, and based  on the information, obtains long term prediction lag T of the enhancement layer to output to long term prediction signal storage 502. In addition, when a difference in sampling frequency occurs between the base layer and enhancement layer, the long term prediction lag T is<br>
 obtained from following equation (1). In addition, in equation (1) , D is the sampling frequency of the enhancement layer, and d is the sampling frequency of the base layer.<br>
T = Dxt/d    ... Equation. (1)<br>
        Long term prediction signal storage 502 is provided with a buffer for storing a long term prediction signal generated earlier. When the length of the buffer is assumed M, the buffer is comprised of sequence s(n-M-l) ~ s(n-l) of the previously generated long term prediction signal .<br>
     Upon receiving the long term prediction lag T from long term prediction lag instructing section 501, long term prediction signal storage 502 fetches long term prediction signal s(n-T) ~ s(n-T+N-l) the long term prediction lag T back from the previous  long term<br>
 prediction signal sequence stored in the buffer, and outputs the result to long term prediction coefficient calculating section 503 and long term prediction signal<br>
17<br><br>
2F04017 —PCT<br><br><br>
generating section 506. Further, long term prediction signal storage 502 receives long term prediction signal s(n) ~ s(n + N-l) from long term prediction signal generating section 506, and updates the buffer by   following equation (2).<br><br><br>
In addition, when the long term prediction lag T is shorter than the frame length N and long t erm predict ion signal storage 502 cannot fetch a long term prediction<br>
  signal, the long term prediction lag T is multiplied by integrals until the T is longer than the frame length N, to enable the long term predict ion signal to be fetched. Otherwise,  long  term  prediction  signal  s(n-T) s(n-T + N-l) the long term predict ion lag T back is repeated<br>
  up to the frame length N to be fetched.<br>
Long  term  prediction  coefficient  calculating section 503 receives the residual signal e (n) ~ e(n + N-l) and long term prediction signal s (n-T) ~ s (n-T + N-1) , and using these signals in following equation (3) , calculates<br>
  a long term prediction coefficient (3 to output to long term prediction coefficient coding section 504.<br>

The foregoing is explanations of the internal configuration of enhancement layer coding section 104 of FIG.1.<br>
The internal configuration of enhancement layer   decoding section 153 of FIG.l will be described below with reference to the block diagram of FIG.6.<br>
In FIG.6,  long term prediction lag instructing<br>

2F04017-PCT	<br>
section 601 obtains the long term prediction lag T of the enhancement layer using the long term prediction information output from base layer decoding section 152 to output to long term prediction signal storage 602.  Long term prediction signal storage 602 is provided with a buffer for storing a long term prediction signal generated earlier. When the length of the buffer is M, the buffer is comprised of sequence s(n-M-l) ~ s(n-l) of the earlier generated long term prediction signal.<br>
 Upon receiving the long term prediction lag T from long term prediction lag instructing section 601, long term prediction signal storage 602 fetches long term prediction signal s(n-T) ~ s(n-T+N-l) the long term prediction lag T back from the previous  long term<br>
 prediction signal sequence stored in the buffer to output to long term prediction signal generating section 604. Further, long term predict ion signal storage 602 receives long term prediction signals s(n) ~ s(n+N-l) from long term prediction signal  generating section 604,  and<br>
  updates the buffer by equation (2) as described above.<br>

coefficient (3q and long term prediction signal s(n-T) ~ s(n-T + N-1) , and using the inputs, calculates long term prediction signal s(n) ~ s(n + N-1) by Eq. (4) as described above, and outputs the result to long term prediction  signal storage 6 02 and adding section 153 as an enhancement layer decoded signal.<br>
The foregoing is explanations of the internal configuration of enhancement layer decoding section 153 of FIG.1 .<br>
 Thus, by providing the enhancement layer to perform long term prediction and performing long term prediction on the residual signal in the enhancement layer using the long term correlation characteristic of the speech or sound signal,  it is possible to code/decode the<br>
speech/sound signal with a wide frequency range using less coded information and to reduce the computation amount.<br>
At this point, the coded information can be reduced by obtaining the long term prediction lag using the long<br>
    term prediction information of the base layer, instead of coding/decoding the long term prediction lag.<br>
Further, by decoding the base layer coded information, it is possible to obtain only the decoded signal of the base layer, and implement the function for<br>
 decoding the speech or sound from part of the coded information in the CELP type speech coding/decoding method (scalable coding).<br>
21<br><br>
2F04017-PCT	<br>
Furthermore, in the long term prediction, using the long term correlation of the speech or sound, a frame with the highest correlation with the current frame is fetched from the buffer, and using a signal of the fetched  frame, a signal of the current frame is expressed. However, in the means for fetching the frame with the highest correlation with the current frame from the buffer, when there is no information to represent the long term correlation of speech or sound such as the pitch lag,<br>
 it is necessary to vary the fetching position to fetch a frame from the buffer while calculating the auto-correlation function of the fetched frame and the current frame to search for the frame with the highest correlation, and the calculation amount for the search<br>
  becomes significantly large.<br>
However, by determining the fetching position uniquely using the pitch lag obtained in base layer coding section 101, it is possible to largely reduce the calculation  amount  required  for  general  long  term<br>
  prediction.<br>
In addition, a case has been described above in the enhancement layer long term prediction method explained in this Embodiment where the long term prediction information output from the base layer decoding section<br>
 is the pitch lag, but the invention is not limited to this, and any information may be used as the long term prediction  information  as  long  as  the  information<br>

represents the long term correlation of speech or sound. Further, the case is described in this Embodiment where the posit ion for long term prediction signal storage 502 to fetch a long term prediction signal from the buffer  is the long term prediction lag T, but the invention is applicable to a case where such a position is position T + a (a is a minute number and settable arbitrarily) around the long term prediction lag T, and it is possible to obtain the  same  effects  and advantages  as  in this<br>
Embodiment even in the case where a minute error occurs in the long term prediction lag T.<br>
For example, long term prediction signal storage 502 receives the long term prediction lag T from long term predict ion lag instructing section 501, fetches long<br>
     term prediction signal s(n-T-a) ~ s(n-T-a+N-l) T+a back from the previous long term prediction signal sequence stored in the buffer, calculates a determination value C using following equation (5) , and obtains a that maximizes the determination value C, and encodes this.<br>
     Further, in the case of decoding, long term prediction signal storage 602 decodes the coded information of a, and using the long term prediction lag T, fetches long term prediction signal s(n-T-a) ~ s (n-T-a + N-1) .<br>

this Embodiment where long term prediction is carried out using a speech/sound signal, the invention is eventually applicable to a case of transforming a speech/sound signal from the time domain to the frequency  domain using orthogonal transform such as MDCT and QMF, and performing long term prediction using a transformed signal (frequency parameter), and it is still possible to obtain the same effects and advantages as in this Embodiment.  For example,  in the case of performing<br>
enhancement layer long term prediction using the frequency parameter of a speech/sound signal, in FIG.5, long term predict ion coefficient calculating section 503 is newly provided with a function of transforming long term prediction signal s(n-T) ~ s(n-T+N-l) from the time<br>
     domain to the frequency domain and with another function of transforming a residual signal to the frequency parameter, and long term prediction signal generating section 506 is newly provided with a function of inverse - transforming long term prediction signals s(n)<br>
   s(n+N-l) from the frequency domain to time domain. Further, in FIG.6, long term predict ion signal generating section 604  is newly provided with the function of inverse - transforming long term prediction signal s(n) ~ s(n+N-l) from the frequency domain to the time domain.<br>

      ABSTRACT <br>
      Base layer coding section 101 encodes an input signal to obtain base layer coded information. Base layer decoding section 102 decodes the base layer coded  information to obtain a base layer decoded signal and long term prediction information (pitch lag). Adding section 103 inverts the polarity of the base layer decoded signal to add to the input signal, and obtains a residual signal.  Enhancement layer coding section 104 encodes a<br>
 long term prediction coefficient calculated using the long term prediction information and the residual signal to obtain enhancement layer coded information. Base layer decoding section 152 decodes the base layer coded information to obtain the base layer decoded signal and<br>
  long term prediction information.  Using the long term prediction  information,  enhancement  layer  decoding section  153  decodes  the  enhancement  layer  coded information to obtain an enhancement layer decoded signal . Adding section 154 adds the base layer decoded signal<br>
and enhancement layer decoded signal to obtain a speech/sound signal. It is thereby possible to implement scalable coding with small amounts of calculation and coded information.<br>
