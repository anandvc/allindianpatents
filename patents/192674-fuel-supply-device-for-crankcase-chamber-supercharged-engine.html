BACKGROUND  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a crankcase chamber supercharged engine and more particularly to an improved induction  and  fuel  supply  system  for  such  engines.<br>
As is well known, in addition to providing a variable volume combustion chamber above the piston, the area below the piston in a reciprocating engine also can function as compressor. With two-cycle engines this is frequently the case and such engines are called two-cycle, crankcase compression engines when the change in volume in the crankcase chamber is employed as a means for pumping air to the  combustion  chamber.<br>
Arrangements have also been proposed wherein the crankcase chamber of a four-cycle engine is employed as an air pump. With four-cycle engines, an actual boost in pressure can be achieved because combustion occurs only every other crankcase revolution. Hence, there can be two pumping phases a given combustion phase and increases in pressure are possible.<br>
However, the efficiency of such crankcase compressors depends upon maintaining a very small clearance volume therein. Therefore, there has been proposed as shown in my United States Letters Patent 5,377,634, entitled "Compressor System For Reciprocating Machine," issued January 3, 1995 and assigned to the assignee hereof, an arrangement wherein the crankcase volume is maintained relatively small and the piston, connecting rod and crankshaft cooperate with the crankcase chamber so as to provide a compressor. This is a very  effective  way  of   increasing  engine  output.<br>
However, there still remains the problem of supplying a fuel charge to the engine. Where the crankcase is used as a compressor,   it   is   desirable   to  provide   a  plenum  chamber  on<br><br>
the outlet side of the crankcaee chamber between the crankcase chamber and the intake valve of the engine. The plenum chamber is useful in storing the increased pressure until the intake valve opens and reducing pressure fluctuations. However, if the charge former or carburetor ia placed on this aide, then the placement of the components and the provision of a large enough plenum chamber can present problems.<br>
It is, therefore, a principal object of this invention to provide an improved crankcase compression type of internal combustion engine wherein the charge forming and induction system permits high efficiencies and also can be compact in construction,<br>
It is a further objection of this invention to provide an improved induction and charge forming system for crankcase compression engines wherein a plenum volume can be provided on the discharge end and the charge former can be located in such a manner as to not reduce the volume of the plenum chamber,<br>
Certain advantages can be achieved by placing the charge former on the inlet side of the engine. In this way, the air charge which is delivered to the crankcase chamber for compression also includes fuel. The advantage of this is that it will ensure that the fuel becomes vaporized before delivered to the combustion chamber. In addition, the partial vaporization of the fuel in the crankcase chamber provides a cooling effect which assists in reducing the heat load  on  the  engine  and   improves   its  efficiency.<br>
It is, therefore, a still further object of this invention to provide an improved charge forming system for a crankcase compression engine wherein the charge former is positioned  upstream  of   the   crankcase   compression  chamber.<br>
When the charge former is placed on the upstream side of the crankcase chamber, then another problem may result. That is, it is conventional to control speed of the engine by employing  a  throttle  valve  and,  when  carburetors  are  employed<br><br>
as the charge former, this throttle valve forms a portion of the charge former. However, if the charge former is placed on the upstream side of the crankcase chamber, then engine braking  can  be  significantly  reduced.<br>
That ia, when the operator desires to reduce the speed of the load driven by the engine and closes the throttle valve, instant engine braking cannot be achieved because of the fact that the throttle valve ia deparated from the combustion chamber by the plenum chamber. The plenum chamber performs its function of damping pressure and, as a result, engine  braking  can  be  reduced  with  such  an  arrangement.<br>
It is, therefore, a still further object of this invention to provide an improved induction and charge forming system for a crankcase compression internal combustion engine wherein the engine braking can be achieved while maintaining the  aforenoted  advantages.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved throttle valve arrangement for the crankcase compression engine wherein the throttle valve is positioned apart from the charge forming system so as to facilitate engine  braking  without   losing  the  aforenoted  advantages.<br>
Another disadvantage with positioning the charge forming system for engines of this type on the inlet side to the crankcase chamber is that control under transient conditions can somewhat deteriorate. That is, many times the operator wishes to change the engine performance .by increasing the power output. When the charge former ia disposed downstream of the crankcase chamber it will be some time before the called for demand in increased fuel supply will actually reach the combustion chamber. Hence, there may be some lag in  engine  performance.<br>
It is, therefore, a still further object of this invention to provide an improved induction system for a crankcase impression internal combustion engine wherein the charge  former  provides  good  transient  response.<br><br><br>
engine comprising a cylinder block, cylinder head assembly defining a cylinder bore, a piston reciprocating in said cylinder bore and forming a combustion chamber at one end of said cylinder bore, a crankcase chamber formed at the other end of said cylinder bore and containing a rotatably joumaled crankshaft, a connecting rod operatively connecting said piston to said crankshaft for driving said crankshaft upon reciprocation of said piston, said crankshaft, said connecting rod, said piston and said crankcase chamber being formed so that said crankcase chamber ftinctions as a compressor as said piston reciprocates in said cylinder bore, said crankcase chamber forming a portion of an induction system for delivering atmospheric air under pressure to said combustion chamber, said induction system having in addition to said combustion chamber an atmospheric air inlet for supplying atmospheric air to said crankcase chamber and a pressure air conduit for communicating compressed air from said crankcase chamber to said combustion chamber, a manually operated throttle valve in said pressure air conduit tor controlling the flow therethrough, a plenum chamber disposed in said pressure air conduit, and atleast one charge former independent of said throttle valve for supplying fiiel to said combustion chamber.<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
Referring now in detail to the drawings and initially to Figure i a four cycle internal combustion engine constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is identified generally by the reference numeral 11, The engine 11 may be of any known configuration such as an in-line engine, a V-type engine or an opposed engine and may have any number of cylinders. Since the invention may be employed with multiple cylinder engines having any of these types of configurations, only a single cylinder of the engine 11 has been  illustrated.<br>
Also, although the invention is described in conjunction with a four cycle internal combustion engine, it is to be understood that facets of the invention may be employed with engines operating on other principles such as two stroke engines.<br>
The engine 11 is provided with a cylinder block crankcase assembly, indicated - generally by the reference numeral 12 and composed of a cylinder block 13 and a crankcase member 14 that are fixed to each other in any suitable manner or which may be formed as a unitary assembly if desired. The cylinder block 13 is provided with one or more   cylinder   bores   15   in   which  pistons   16   reciprocate   and<br><br>
which extend horizontally as shown in the drawings. Each piston 16 is pivotally connected by means of a piston pin 17 to  the   small   end  of  a  connecting  rod  18,<br>
The big end of the connecting rod 18 is journaled on the throw or crank pin 19 of a crankshaft, indicated generally by the reference numeral 21 which is rotatably journaled within a crankcase chamber 22 which, in turn, is formed in the crankcase member 23. If the engine 11 is of a multi-cylinder type, each crankcase chamber 22 will be preferably sealed from  the  others,<br>
A cylinder head assembly, indicated generally by the reference numeral 24 is affixed to the cylinder block 13 in any well known manner. The cylinder head 24 has a recess 25 formed in its lower surface which recess align with the cylinder bore 15 and the head of the piston 16 to form the individual combustion chambers of the engine 11 . The recesses 25 will, at times, be referred to as the combustion chambers since at top dead center (TDC) their volume comprises the major  portion  of  the  clearance  volume.<br>
An intake passage 26 extends through one side of the cylinder head 24 and is served by an induction and charge forming system, indicated generally by the reference numeral 27 and which will be described in more detail later. The intake passage 26 terminates at its inner side at a valve seat  which  is   controlled  by  an  intake  valve   28,<br>
In a similar manner, an exhaust passage 29 extends through the opposite side of the cylinder head 24 and terminates in a valve seat that is controlled by an exhaust valve 31. In the illustrated embodiment, the intake and exhaust valves, 28 and 31 respectively, are operated by respective rocker arms 32 and 33 v;hich, in turn, are controlled by a single overhead camshaft 34 that is journaled for rotation in the cylinder head 24 in a known manner, The camshaft 34 is driven from the crankshaft 21 by a drive mechanism at one half crankshaft speed, as is well known in this  art.<br><br>
The valve springs keeper mechanisms etc. associated with the intake and exhaust valves 28 and 31 may be of any conventional construction and those skilled in the art will readily understand the valve actuation and how this can be accomplished.<br>
An   important   feature   of   this   invention   is   the   way   in which    the    crankcaee    chamber    22,     connecting    rod    18    and crankshaft   2i   are   configured   so   as   to   cooperate   with   the piston  16   and  act  as  a  positive  displacement   air  compressor or  supercharger  supplying  a  pressurized  air/fuel  mixture  to the  combustion  chamber  25.     To  this  end,   the  construction  of the   cylinder   block   crankcase   assembly   22,    crankshaft   21, connecting  rods  18  and  piston  16  which  permits  this  positive displacement  compressor  is  constructed in  accordance  with  the manner  described  in  United  States  Letters   Patent   5,377,634, entitled     "Compressor    System    For    Reciprocating    Machine," issued  January  3,   1995   and  assigned  to  the   assignee  hereof. That  disclosure  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference.      In this system   the   air/fuel   mixture    is   drawn   into   the    induction system  27   through  an     atmospheric  air  inlet   35   which  draws air   through   any   type   of   inlet   device   which   may   include   a silencer  and/or  filter.   This  charge  is  drawn  by  the  negative pressure     created     in     the     crankcase     chamber     22     by     the reciprocating  motion  of   the  piston  16,     The   construction  of the  piston  16,   connecting  rod  IS,   crankshaft  21  and  crankcase chamber  22,   as  noted  in  the   aforenoted  incorporated  Patent, is  such  that  they  define  an  enclosed  volume  inside  crankcase chamber   22   into   which   the   air/fuel   charge   is   drawn  by   the upward  motion  of  piston   16,<br>
Referring now in more detail to the charge forming system 27, the air inlet device 35 delivers the inducted atmospheric air to a charge former 36, namely a carburetor of a conventional type such as the illustrated piston type air valve carburetor 36. The carburetor 36 unlike conventional carburetors is without any manually operated throttle valve or  other  flow     controlling  mechanism.<br><br><br>
inducted air and delivers it to an intake pipe or manifold 37. The intake manifold in turn delivers the fuel air mixture to an inlet chamber 38 formed on the lower side of the cylinder block 13 and crankcase member 23, This chamber 38 is closed by a cover plate 39. The inlet chamber 38 communicates with the crankcase chamber 22 to which it supplies the uncompressed air/fuel mixture through an intake port 41. As noted in the aforenoted Patent, the intake port 41 is opened and  closed  by  the  connecting  rod  18  during  ita  movement.<br>
As the piston 16, connecting rod 18 and crankshaft 21 continue their movement, the inducted charge will continue to be drawn into the crankcase chamber 22 until the connecting rod 18 again closes the intake port 41. Thereafter the inducted charge will be compressed in the closed chamber into v/hich the crankcase chamber 22 is formed on one side of the connecting rod 18. This compressed charge is then delivered to   a  plenum  chamber   42   in  a  manner   to  be   described   shortly.<br>
The plenum chamber 42 is formed by a housing element 43 that aealingly engages crankcase chamber 22 on its upper side, opposite the intake port 41 to the crankcase chamber 22. The plenum chamber 42 receives a supply of compressed air/fuel mixture from the crankcase chamber 22 through a reed valve 44. The reed valve 44 controls the flow through an opening 45 formed in an upper wall of the crankcase member 22 and  permits   the   charge   only  to   exit.<br>
A pressure air conduit 46 delivers the compressed fuel air charge from the plenum chamber 42 to the cylinder head intake passage 26. Because the plenum chamber 42 can be quite large due to the remote positioning of the; carburetor 35, the pressure delivered to the intake passage 26 will be relatively uniform. Because of the remote positioning of the carburetor 35 from the intake passage 26 and the presence of the large plenum chamber 42 there would be a loss of effective engine braking on decelerations if a conventional carburetor  throttle  valve  arrangement  were   used.<br><br>
Therefore and in accordance with one feature of the invention, a manually operated throttle valve assembly 47 is positioned downstream of plenum chamber 42. This throttle valve assembly 47 includes a throttle body 48 in which a butterfly type throttle valve 49 is positioned. The throttle valve 49 is operated by a throttle linkage 51 in a known manner by a remote controller. As noted, this layout is advantageous in that it eliminates several problems associated with the employment of a conventional single assembly  charge   former  and  throttle  mechanism.<br>
A conventional assembly positioned upstream of the<br>
plenum chamber 42 will adversely impact engine braking due to<br>
the fact that the unthrottled and compressed charge present<br>
in the plenum chamber 42 at the time of the throttle's<br>
closing for engine deceleration will induce a lag in the<br>
engine's response since this larger than now desired charge<br>
will     tend    to     inhibit     engine     deceleration,	The     same<br>
conventional assembly positioned downstream of the plenum chamber 42 will adversely effect engine efficiency since the fuel would no longer be drawn into the engine crankcase 13 where it would effectively cool the bottom end of the engine. In addition, it is less likely that the air/fuel mixture delivered to the engine 11 for combustion will be fully vaporized since it no longer first enters the crankcase chamber 22 as before, where it would be readily vaporized by the  motion  of  the  piston  16.<br>
With the embodiment described as above, however, no engine lag upon initiation of deceleration is encountered since the positioning of the throttle valve assembly 47 downstream of the plenum chamber 42 allows throttle valve 49 to immediately limit the quantity of the air/fuel charge entering combustion chamber 25 from the plenum chamber 42. The engine efficiency will also remain higher since the air/fuel mixture enters the engine upstream of the plenum 42, there to cool the engine's bottom end and also to be fully vaporized  by  the  motion  of  piston  IS.<br><br>
The lubrication system for the crank chamber supercharged engine 11 will now be described. A conventional four cycle lubrication system is inappropriate for this type of engine as one of the requirements for a four stroke crankcase compression type engine is that the crankcase chamber 22 must be of minimum possible volume in order to obtain effective air / fuel charge compression and also because all of the intake charge passes through the ciankcase chamber 22.<br>
This is incompatible with the standard four cycle practice of utilizing the crankcase chamber 22 as the oil storage reservoir for the engine 11. However the valve train including the valves 28 and 31, the rocker arms 32 and 33, the cam shaft 34 and their bearings and guides require adequate lubrication. Therefore the engine 11 utilizes a lubricating system as described in more detail in the copending application no. 1532/'MAS/95 entitled "Lubrication Device For Crank Chamber Supercharged Engine" filed on 24 November 1995. This system utilizes two oil delivery systems: one of which supplies tour cycle oil to the various components of the cylinder head 24 and timing case and a second which supplies two cycle oil to the various components of the cylinder block 13.<br>
Reterring to the tour cycle oil delivery system, this is best shown in Figures 1 and 2 and is identified generally by the reference numeral 52. Oil<br><br>
for this system is supplied from a four cycle oil tank 53 which contains the type of oil utilized normally with four cycle engines. This oil is supplied to the camshaft 34 at its main bearing (not shown) through conduit 54 in which is positioned an oil pump 55. The pump 55 is driven in any suitable manner. The camshaft 34 is drilled to provide a main oil gallery. Oil is delivered into camshaft 34 through a cross drilled camshaft oil inlet 56. Oil is delivered fi-om the main gallery to   the camshaft bearings (not shown) and rocker arm assemblies 32 and 33<br><br>
espectively though oil feed holes drilled in the camahaft 4, Thus it is readily apparent that all of the components f the valve actuating mechanism are effectively lubricated / the four cycle oil which subsequently collects along a jbricating  return  path   (not  shown).<br>
This return path routs the oil to a timing case 57 where : lubricates the components of the camshaft timing drive schanism, such as a chain 58 and the camshaft sprocket (not lown) and the crankshaft sprocket 59 before draining out of .ming case 57 at one end of the crankshaft 21 through exit .ppls 61. The exit nipple 61 supplies a four cycle oil ;turn conduit 62 which, in turn, returns to the four cycle ,1  reservoir  53 ,<br>
Referring now to the two cycle oil delivery system, dicated generally by the reference numeral 63, also shown imarily in Figures 1 and 2, it includes a two cycle oil nk 64. The oil tank 64 holds a supply of oil of the type rmally used for two cycle engine lubrication. An oil pump is driven in a known manner and pumps two cycle oil from e two cycle oil tank 64 through a conduit 66 to the ends of e engine block assembly 13, as seen on Figure 1, via branch nduits   67   and  68   respectively.<br>
Conduit   67   supplies   oil   to   the   cylinder   bore   15   at   a<br>
rration  that  is  exposed  to  the  crankcase  chamber  22  when  the<br>
3ton   16   is   approaching   top   dead   center.      This   oil   is   fed<br>
:o  groove 69   (see  also  Figure  4)cut  along  the  exterior  side<br>
the  connecting  rod  18,     When  conduit  67   is  thus  exposed,<br>
5  connecting  rod  18  is  positioned  as  shown  in  Figures  1  and<br>
The  lubricant  will  collect  in  the  groove  and  as  the  piscon<br>
reverses   direction   and   moves   toward   bottom   dead   center-<br>
;    oil    v;ill    be    pumped   along  -groove    69    to    lubricate    the<br>
    lower    surface    as    well    as    the    upper    end   of    the<br>
meeting   rod   18.   This   action   will   also   cause   the   oil   to<br>
,er  the  piston  pin  assembly  17  through  inlet  slot  71,   there<br>
lubricate  the  surface  of  piston  pin  17,<br><br>
The connecting rod groove 69 extends around the upper end of the connecting rod 18 to a point where it is then routed through a piston oil slot 72 to a recess 73 formed on the lower portion of the piston IS and finally on to the cylinder wall. Any remaining oil will drain to the crankcase chamber 22 and specifically to the inlet chamber 38. From there the oil will drain through a two cycle drain nipple 74. The oil drains into a two cycle oil return conduit 75 which, in turn, connects at its lower end to the two cycle oil reservoir  S4,<br>
As the piston 16 reciprocates downwards upon initiation of an engine inlet or power stroke the supply of two cycle oil to the crankcase chamber 22 from conduit 67 will be restricted to lubricate only the skirt of the piston 16. However, continued downward motion of piston 16 exposes the outlet for conduit 67 to an upper side piston recess 76 in which the oil will collect and lubricate the outer circumferential surface of piston 16 until it too is collected at the inlet nipple of the two cycle oil return conduit  74.<br>
Conduit 68 supplies two cycle lubricating oil to the engine's big end. As can be best seen in Figure 2 oil is delivered by the conduit 68 to one main bearing 77 of the crankshaft 2l, The crankshaft 21 is cross drilled enabling the oil supplied at crankshaft bearing 77 to not only lubricate this bearing 77 but also to circulate through crankshaft 21 to its other main bearing. 78 which journals crankshaft 21 to crankcase chamber 22. Through these cross drillings lubricant is also delivered to a bearing 79 that journals the connecting rod 18 to the crank throw 19. Thus, all of the crankshaft bearings.in crankcase chamber 22 are adequately lubricated by the two cycle oil before it collects in the air inlet 38 of the crankcase 22 for delivery to the two cycle oil return conduit 75 which, in turn, connects at its   lower  end  to  two   cycle  oil   reservoir   64 .<br><br>
Under some circumstances it may be desirable to control the maximum pressure of the charge delivered to the combustion chamber 25, as would be the case during engine deceleration . A venting or pressure relief mechanism is disposed in the charge forming system 27 to accomplish this. As can be best seen in Figure 2 an air vent hose 81 extends between the plenum chamber 42 and the air inlet pipe 37. The flow through this hose 81 is controlled by a spring loaded poppet type valve 82. The valve spring 33 engages a diaphragm 84 to which a valve element 85 is fixed. The spring 83 has sufficient preload to cause the valve element 85 to sealingly engage air vent inlet hose 81 until such time as when the pressure of the charge in the plenum chamber 42 is sufficiently high to displace the valve 82 rearward, thereby allowing the pressurized charge to vent back to the atmospheric  air  inlet  37   through  a  vent   air  outlet  hose   86.<br>
If desired the chamber in which the spring 83 is located may also be connected by a conduit 87 to the intake manifold 45 downstream of the throttle valve 49. When this is done, under extreme decelerations the high intake manifold vacuum will overcome the bias of the spring 83 and cause the valve element 85 to open and relieve the high pressure in the plenum  chamber  42,<br>
Figure 5 shows in more schematic form an engine<br>
constructed in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
invention.	In    this    invention,     the    bypass    passage    way<br>
provided for by the conduit 81 and the pressure responsive valve 82 is replaced by a bypass conduit 101 in which an electrically operated valve 102 is positioned. In addition, in this embodiment, the induction system air inlet device is shown schematically at 103. As previously noted, this air inlet device may include a silencing system and/or a filter (not   shown).<br>
In this embodiment, the carburetor 36 is replaced by a small simple variable venturi carburetor, indicated generally by  the  reference  numeral   104   that   is  positioned  between  the<br><br>
plenum chamber 42 and the cylinder head intake passage 26. It should be noted that in this figure components which are the same as those of the previously described embodiment have been identified by the same reference numerals and will not be described again, except insofar as to understand the construction  and  operation  of   this  embodiment,<br>
The carburetor 104 is designed so as to provide only the low range fuel requirements for the engine, however, its throttle valve controls the total air flow to the engine. The carburetor 104 is supplied with fuel from a fuel tank indicated schematically at 105 under pressure from a pump 106 through  a  conduit   in  which  a  filter  107   is  positioned.<br>
The main fuel requirements for the engine are supplied by a fuel injector line 108 in which a fuel controlling valve 109 is positioned. This passage 108 sprays fuel through injector, under mid and high speed and high load conditions that  may  be  a  manifold  type  or  port  type  injector.<br>
An ECU, indicated generally by the reference numeral 111, receives a signal c from a knock sensor, a signal a indicative of the position of the throttle valve of the carburetor 104 and other signals, such as an engine speed signal indicated at b, The ECU control 111 controls the valve 102 through an electrical conductor 112 and also controls the ignition circuit, indicated at Ii3 . This controls the firing of the spark plug 114. The spark plug was not illustrated in the previous embodiment but is utilized  for  firing  the  charge   in  the  combustion  chamber.<br>
By employing the ECU 111, it is possible to obtain maximum pressure and performance while avoiding knocking. If knocking is detected by the sensor signal c, the valve 102 is opened to lower the boost pressure. Also, ignition timing can be retarded for this same purpose. However, it is better to maintain optimum engine performance by maintaining the ignition firing as required while, at the same time, reducing the  actual  pressure.<br><br>
This embodiment has the advantage of providing better performance under transient conditions since the charge forming system ia closer to the combujstion chamber. By utilizing a small primary carburetor and a fuel injection, the size of the plenum chamber 42 still may be maintained large, In addition, engine braking performance will be improved. If desired, the pressure in the plenum chamber 42 may also be relieved under braking conditions to achieve this goal.<br>
Figures  6  and  7  show schematically another  embodiment  of<br>
the  invention.     This  embodiment   is  more  like  the  embodiment<br>
of   Figures   1-4.      However,    in   order   to   improve   performance<br>
under    transient    conditions,     a    simple    carburetor    151    is<br>
provided  in  a  bypass  air  flow  line  152  that  bypasses  the  main<br>
-hrottle   valve   49   in  the  main  air  passage   45.      The   simple<br>
carburetor   152   has   a  venturi   section   153   that   is   fed  by  a<br>
small  bypass  air  passage  154.    A  simple  main  metering  jet  155<br>
supplies  fuel  from  a  fuel  bowl  156  to  the  air  flowing  through<br>
he  passage  154.    Hence,   as  air  flow  changes  due  to  transient<br>
conditions,    adequate   fuel   will   be  provided   during   the   time<br>
period  before   the   main   supply   from   the   main   carburetor   36<br>
eaches   the   intake  passage.<br>
It should be readily apparent form the foregoing eacription that the described embodiments of the invention rovide a very effective induction system for a crankcase ompression internal combustion engine that achieves good hrottle response under both braking and acceleration, ermits a compact construction, and also provides an rrangement wherein the maximum pressure in the charge slivered to the combustion chambers can be controlled if desired, Of course, the foregoing description is that of referred embodiments, of the invention, and various changes  modifications may be made without departing from the  and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended .aims .<br><br>
