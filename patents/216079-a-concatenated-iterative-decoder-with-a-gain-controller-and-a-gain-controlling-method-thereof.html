				<td>A DECODER HAVING A GAIN CONTROLLER<br>
IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a concatenated iterative decoder<br>
for a receiver in a mobile communication system, and in particular, to an iterative<br>
decoder having a gain controller for controlling the gain of an extrinsic<br>
information signal output from a component decoder in a mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Some future mobile communication systems, such as IMT-2000 (CDMA<br>
2000) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), are expected to<br>
use a turbo code, which requires an iterative decoder. Turbo codes are also used<br>
in satellite communication systems concatenated convolutional codes,<br>
concatenated block codes, or product convolutional codes are used for deep space<br>
communication system require an iterative decoder.<br>
A typical iterative decoder is constituted out of a plurality of component<br>
decoders serially concatenated. Each component decoder is a SISO (Soft-In Soft-<br>
Out), SOVA (Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm), or MAP (Maximum A Posteriori<br>
Probability) decoder.<br>
A turbo decoder with two component decoders will be described by way<br>
of example. The component decoder at the front end is called the first component<br>
decoder and the component decoder at the rear end is called the second<br>
component decoder.<br>
The first component decoder receives a systematic code signal, a first<br>
parity signal, and a first extrinsic information signal for decoding, and outputs a<br>
decoded signal including a systematic code signal component and a reliability<br><br>
value component (hereinafter, referred to as second extrinsic information)<br>
representing the new extrinsic information of a decoded result. The second<br>
component decoder receives the primary decoded signal from the first component<br>
decoder and a second parity signal among parity signals on a radio channel, for<br>
decoding and outputs a secondary decoded signal including the first extrinsic<br>
information signal component representing the new extrinsic information of the<br>
secondary decoded result. The first extrinsic information signal component is fed<br>
back to the input of the first component decoder.<br>
As described above, the conventional turbo decoder decodes a received<br>
signal with extrinsic information generated from each component decoder,<br>
regardless of channel status.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
According to various preferred embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
gain of the extrinsic information signal generated from a component decoder can<br>
be controlled by determining a gain control value from one of the following and<br>
fixed value obtained by simulation or numerical results: SNR; energy to noise<br>
power ratio (Eb/No; a function of extrinsic information; adaptive algorithms using<br>
a target measurement as an extrinsic information variance; or a combination of the<br>
above four methods. Each source for determining the gain control value<br><br>
corresponds to a method for gain control: the first method uses an empirically<br>
determined optimal constant based on the SNR; the second method uses a gain<br>
value inversely proportional to Eb/No; the third method uses a function of the<br>
extrinsic information variance; and the fourth method uses a target measure<br>
measurement as an extrinsic information variance.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an iterative decoder having a gain controller<br>
in a mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIGs. 1 and 2, a description will be given of the<br>
configuration and operation of the iterative decoder according to the first and<br>
second methods. FIG. 3 will be used to describe the operation of the iterative<br>
decoder according to the third method.<br>
In FIG. 1, a controller 10 provides overall control to the iterative decoder.<br>
A memory 30 stores iterative decoder environment set-up information and gain<br>
control values determined by SNR or Eb/No. A transmission channel 40 receives<br>
data from a transmitter. A demodulator 50 demodulates signals received on the<br>
transmission channel 40. A channel deinterleaver 60 descrambles demodulated<br>
signal received from the channel demodulator 50 and outputs systematic code<br>
signals and a plurality of parity signals. An iterative decoder 70 includes a<br>
plurality of serially concatenated component decoders and iteratively decodes the<br>
systematic code signals and the plurality of parity signals received from the<br>
channel deinterleaver 60, a plurality of extrinsic information which gain is<br>
controlled by gain control value, which depends on the status of the transmission<br>
channel 40, received from the controller 10. The iterative decoder 70 controls the<br>
gain of an extrinsic information component added after decoding with the gain<br>
control value outputted from the controller, for decoding. The configuration of<br>
the iterative decoder 70 will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
The iterative decoder 70 iteratively decodes N-bit user data (systematic<br>
code signal and parity signals) corresponding to an information message by the<br>
iteration number control signal received from the controller 10. Upon receipt of<br>
an N-bit length frame signal on the transmission channel 40, the demodulator 50<br>
demodulates the received frame signal. The channel deinterleaver 60 descrambles<br>
the demodulated data frame received from the demodulator 50 and outputs the<br><br>
systematic code signal and parity signals to the iterative decoder 70. A channel<br>
status analyser 20 detects a variable channel environment factor, that is, SNR or<br>
Eb/No, and feeds it to the controller 10. Then, the controller 10 outputs a gain<br>
control value, which is determined using the channel status, received from the<br>
memory 30 and the iterative decoding number based on the iterative decoder<br>
environment information to the iterative decoder 70. Here, the value of the gain<br>
control signal can be fixed regardless of channel status. The iterative decoder 70<br>
manipulates the gain of the extrinsic information signal based on the gain control<br>
signal, and decodes a signal received from the channel deinterleaver 60 using the<br>
iterative decoding number.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the iterative decoder 70<br>
with gain controllers in a mobile communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. It is assumed that the iterative decoder 70<br>
has two component decoders. FIG. 2 corresponds to the first and second methods<br>
of gain control. The first and second component decoders can be integrated into<br>
a single one because they are the same in operation except for different input<br>
values.<br>
The iterative decoder 70 of FIG. 1 includes a first component decoder 101,<br>
a second component decoder 105, a first gain controller 115, a second gain<br>
controller 117, an interleaver 103, two deinterleavers 109 and 111, and a<br>
demultiplexer (DEMUX) 107.<br>
Assuming that the channel deinterleaver 60 of FIG. 1 outputs a systematic<br>
code signal Xk and a parity signal Yk including first and second parity signals Ylk<br>
and Y2k, the first component decoder 101 receives Xk, Ylk from the DEMUX 107,<br>
and first extrinsic information from the deinterleaver 109, subjects Xk to decoding,<br>
and outputs a primary decoded signal. The decoded output includes a decoded Xk<br>
component, a first extrinsic information component, and a component of newly<br>
added extrinsic information about a decoded result (second extrinsic information<br>
signal). A subtracter 102 removes the Xk component and first extrinsic<br>
information component from the primary decoded signal (Xk+EXT1+EXT2), and<br>
outputs only the second extrinsic information signal to a first gain controller 115.<br><br>
The first gain controller 15 controls the gain of the second extrinsic<br>
information signal using a predetermined gain control value and outputs the gain-<br>
controlled second extrinsic information signal to an adder 104. The gain control<br>
value for use in controlling the gain is supplied from the controller 10 of FIG. 1 or<br>
can be set to a fixed value. The fixed value is experimentally obtained according<br>
to various channel states. The fixed value used in FIGs. 4 and 5 described below<br>
is about 1.7. The adder 104 adds Xk received from the input end of the first<br>
component decoder 101 to the gain-controlled second extrinsic information signal.<br>
The interleaver 103 interleaves the output of the adder 104.<br>
The second component decoder 105 decodes the interleaved signal<br>
received from interleaver 103 and Y2k received from the DEMUX 107, and<br>
outputs a secondary decoded signal including an Xk component, the second<br>
extrinsic information signal component, and a first extrinsic information signal<br>
component newly generated from the second component decoder 105. A second<br>
subtracter 106 receives the interleaved Xk and gain-controlled second extrinsic<br>
information from the interleaver 103 and the secondary decoded signals from the<br>
second component decoder 105, removes the second extrinsic information signal<br>
component EXT2 and the Xk component from the secondary decoded signal<br>
(Xk+EXT1+EXT2), and outputs only the first extrinsic information signal<br>
component EXT1 to the first component decoder 101. The deinterleaver 109<br>
deinterleaves the first extrinsic information signal received from the second<br>
subtracter 106. The deinterleaver 111 deinterleaves the secondary decoded signal<br>
received from the second component decoder 105. The deinterleavers 109 and<br>
111 are used to rearrange a sequence of the interleaved output of the interleaver<br>
103 in its original order.<br>
Without the interleaver 103, there is no need for the deinterleavers 109<br>
and 111. The second gain controller 117 receives the first extrinsic information<br>
signal from the deinterleaver 109 or from the second subtracter 106 in the absence<br>
of the interleaver 103, controls the gain of the first extrinsic information signal<br>
with a gain control value received from the controller 10 of FIG. 1, or fixed value,<br>
and feeds the gain-controlled first extrinsic information signal to the first<br>
component decoder 101. While the gains of both the first and second extrinsic<br>
information signals output from the component decoders 101 and 105 are<br><br>
controlled, only either of the gains can be controlled. The first and second gain<br>
controllers 115 and 117 use either the same gain control value or different gain<br>
control value.<br>
A metric value Mt accumulated in the first or second component decoder<br>
101 or 105, respectively, by the first or second gain controller 115 or 117,<br>
respectively, for a predetermined time is calculated by<br><br>
where Mt is an accumulated metric value for time t, ut is a codeword for a<br>
systematic bit, Xt,j is a codeword for a parity bit, Yt,j is a value received on a<br>
channel, Lc is channel reliability extrinsic information, L(ut) is the previous<br>
extrinsic information for time t, and G is a gain control value.<br>
In first and second methods among five gain determining methods, the<br>
SNR and Eb/No are used.<br>
The controller 10 generates the gain control value G in the first and<br>
second methods, that is, based on SNR or Eb/No, in the receiver of FIG. 1. The<br>
first method uses an empirically determined optimal constant as a gain control<br>
value, given by<br><br>
where the constant range is set for all SNRs. The simulation results when the<br>
SNR is used as a gain control value for a SOVA component decoder are tabulated<br>
in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Table 1 can be stored as a database in memory 30 and is controlled by the<br>
controller 10 as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2.<br><br>
Table 2 can be stored in a database of memory 30 to be controlled by the<br>
controller 10 as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
In the second method, G is a value inversely proportional to Eb/No,<br><br><br>
Simulation results from a SOVA component decoder are listed in Table 2.<br>
The value empirically obtained in the first and second methods can be<br>
stored in the database of the memory 30 and fed as an optimal gain control value<br>
to the first and second gain controllers 115 and 117, respectively. It is noted from<br>
Table 2 that optimal BER and FER are achieved when the gain control factor is<br>
1.7. Therefore, according to these simulation results, the gain control value<br>
should be fixed to 1.7.<br>
The data presented hereinbelow are produced under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
1. IMT-2000 F-SCH RS2;<br>
2. Code rate: 1/4;<br>
3. Frame length: 568 bits (pure information 552 bits + 16 CRC bits);<br>
4. An Additive White Gaussian Noise (AGWN) channel;<br>
5. Termination: on;<br>
6. Floatation point simulation;<br>
7. 8 iterations;<br>
8. Simulation stop criteria: frame error number 1000; and<br>
9. Input data: random data.<br>
For the third method, the gain control value is determined by a function of<br>
extrinsic information variance, and is calculated as<br><br>
where N is the number of information bits and Ext(i) is extrinsic<br><br>
information.<br>
In accordance with the third method, first and second gain control value<br>
detectors 121 and 120, respectively, are provided at the respective input ends of<br>
the first and second gain controllers 115 and 117, respectively, as shown in FIG. 3,<br>
so that they obtain gain control values derived using Eq.4 and output them to the<br>
gain controllers 115 and 117 to thereby control the gain of extrinsic information<br>
Ext(i). BER estimating adaptive algorithms include LMS (Least Mean Square)<br>
algorithms and modified LMS algorithms, for example.<br>
In the fourth method, the e/N from the Equation 4 is calculated using the<br>
following three functions.<br>
The gain control value detector 121 subjects Xk at the input end of the<br>
first component decoder 101 and information at the output end thereof to hard<br>
decision decoding, compares the hard-decision values, and checks the resulting<br>
BER. If the number of information bits input to the first component decoder 101<br>
is N and the difference between the information bits and the decoded data bits is e,<br>
the BER is e/N. When e/N is smaller, which implies that the first component<br>
decoder 101 performed a poor decoding, there is no need for assigning a large<br>
gain to the resulting extrinsic information. When e/N is greater, a large gain (high<br>
reliability) is assigned. An intended gain can be adjusted through a function of a<br>
BER resulting from estimation of a BER at the input end of the component<br>
decoder, thereby increasing decoding performance. As shown in FIG. 3, the gain<br>
control value detector 121 can use Yk as another extrinsic information for gain<br>
control.<br>
Accordingly, the gain Gl of the first gain controller 121 is calculated by<br>
one of three functions.<br>
Function 1<br><br><br><br>
Similarly, the second gain controller 120 compares the outputs of the<br>
adder 104 and the deinterleaver 109 and calculates a gain by Eq. 5.<br>
The fifth method controls a gain in a plurality of adaptive algorithms<br>
using a target measurement as an extrinsic information variance.<br>
As described above, BER and FER are reduced by controlling the gains<br>
of the extrinsic information output from component decoders. FIGs. 4, 5, and 6<br>
show simulation results from the above described simulation environment.<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5 illustrate BER and FER measurements with respect to gain<br>
values in a normal case (an iterative decoder free of a gain controller) and a gain<br>
control case (an iterative decoder with a gain controller) where gains are<br>
controlled at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.dB of Eb/No according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Here, the BERs and FERs are measured at every 0.1 gain<br>
control value ranging from 1.5 to 2.0.<br>
It can be noted from FIG. 4 that the iterative decoder with a gain<br>
controller exhibits a lower BER, especially at gain control factors of 1.7 to 1.9,<br>
than the general iterative decoder. It can be noted from FIG. 5 that the iterative<br>
decoder with a gain controller exhibits a lower FER, especially at gain control<br>
factors of 1.6 to 1.7 than the general iterative decoder.<br>
FIG. 6 is a graph comparing a normal case with a gain control case in<br><br>
terms of performance. Here, extrinsic information output is divided by an SNR<br>
with the SNR used as a gain control factor and the resulting value is applied to the<br>
input of the next end. The gain control case shows poor performance in<br>
comparison with the normal case between 0.5 dB and ldB of Eb/No. As inferred<br>
from the above two results, a scaling factor 0.5 (=1/2) at Eb/No of 2dB is not<br>
good as compared to the optimal gain control factor 1.7. On the other hand, the<br>
gain control case is superior to the normal case at 1.5 and 2.0dB of Eb/No. The<br>
optimal gain control factor can again be considered to be 1.7.<br>
As described above, the present invention reduces BER and FER by<br>
controlling the gain of the extrinsic information signals being used as decoder<br>
output in an iterative decoder.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
