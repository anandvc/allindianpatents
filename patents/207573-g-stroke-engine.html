The Patent Act, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE.SPECIFICATION,<br>
(Section   10;   Rule   13)<br>
1)"G-STROKE ENGINE".<br>
2) MR. GAURI PRAKASH AGARWAL (Indian National), having office at 37, TELCO SR. OFFICERS' SOCIETY, PIMPRI, PUNE-411 018.<br>
The following specifications particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to G-stroke engine.<br>
Conventionally there are two types of spark ignition internal combustion engines. They are commonly known as 2-stroke engine and 4-stroke engines. All actions related to combustion and power generation take place above the piston in a 4-stroke engine; whereas in a 2-stroke engine, the combustion chamber above the piston and the crank case below the piston are connected through a passage called port (s).<br>
In a 4-stroke engine, during the first downwards movement of piston, that is, half revolution of crank shaft, air and fuel mixture is sucked in the cavity above the piston, and the inlet valve is closed at the end of downward movement of piston. After this 'suction stroke' is completed, the piston starts 'compression stroke' where, the air and fuel mixture is compressed by the upward movement of piston with both inlet and exhaust valves closed. As the piston reaches the top dead center (TDC), the compressed air and fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug. During the 'firing stroke' or 'working stroke' the fuel starts burning and produces heat and high pressure to push the piston downwards. Finally, during "exhaust stroke' the piston starts moving up and exhaust valve is opened to allow burnt gases to be expelled out of the engine.<br>
Thus, in a 4-stroke engine, the working stroke or firing stroke takes place in every two full rotations of crank shaft.<br>
Similarly, in a 2-stroke engine, in the upper movement of the piston from its bottom most position called Bottom Dead Center (BDC), causes two actions suction of air and fuel in crank case, and compression of the mixture in combustion chamber.<br>
High pressure produced by combustion pushes the piston downwards, which causes crank shaft to rotate and generate force. At the same time, burnt gases are allowed to escape out through exhaust port, and the mixture of air and fuel in crank case in compressed. Just before the piston reaches BDC, the transfer port is opened, and thus compressed mixture is transferred to the combustion chamber.<br>
2<br><br>
Thus, in a 2-stroke engine, the working stroke or firing stroke takes place once in every one rotation of crank shaft the engine size and thus its weight and cost is much less than that of 4 stroke engine for same power output.<br>
Major disadvantage of a 2-stroke engine is that, as the exhaust port and the transfer port (s) are open during the same time, a considerable amount of fresh charge (air and fuel mixture) escapes out along with the exhaust gases. This causes higher fuel consumption and also higher hydrocarbon emissions as compared to a 4-stroke engines.<br>
However, one more disadvantage of a 2-stroke engine as compared to 4-stroke engine is that, the lubricating oil is required to be mixed with air and fuel mixture for providing lubrication to the rotating components in the crank case. This is unlike a 4-stroke engine, where, crankcase and combustion chamber are always separated by piston and thus, the crank case is lubricated by oil stored in the crank case. Because the oil in 2-stroke engine is carried to the combustion chamber by the air and fuel mixture, it gets burnt with the fuel and produces exhaust gas pollutants, such as soot and particulate matter (PM). This drawbacks is reduced in a 2-stroke engine fitted with DFIS (Direct fuel injection system) in which only fresh air is let in the crank case instead of air and fuel mixture and metered quantity of fuel is injected through an electronically controlled injector after the exhaust port and transfer ports are closed.<br>
The present invention 'G-stroke engine' is developed with a main objective of eliminating all the drawbacks of conventional methods.<br>
It should have smaller size and weight as compared to 4-stroke engines and still should provide same power output.<br><br><br>
It should have certain mechanism, whereby, the fresh air will not escape with burnt gases. This will cause efficient use of fuel and will also reduce pollution.<br>
The newly invented engine should not require lubricating oil to be added along with the fuel, but it should use the oil which will be stored in crank case. This will reduce pollutants like soot and particulate matter (PM).<br>
The engine to be developed should have increased fuel efficiency. For this , it should include electronic fuel injection unit instead of mechanical system, which is used in conventional methods.<br>
The present invention 'G-stroke engine' is designed with a goal of fulfilling all the objectives mentioned above, it increases fuel efficiency and emits less pollutants. The newly invented engine has benefits of both 2 stoke and 4-stroke engines. This has been possible after extensive research and trials.<br>
The present invention 'G-Stroke engine' will now be explained in details with the help of figures 1 to 3 of accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematic layout of G-stroke engine with cam operated inlet valve.<br>
Figure 2 shows schematic layout of a G-stroke engine with solenoid operated inlet<br>
valve.<br>
Figure 3a shows side view of G-Stroke engine with cam operated inlet valve.<br>
Figure 3b shows side view of G-Stroke engine with solenoid operated inlet valve.<br>

Figure 2 illustrates Electronic Fuel Injection Unit (1), spark plug (2), inlet valve (3), piston (4), inlet canal (5) fan (6), crank shaft (7), crank case (8), solenoid (14), and air inlet (13).<br>
The G-stroke engine has been developed by thoroughly studying currently available engines and modifying it to incorporate some advanced features.<br><br><br>
As mentioned earlier, the conventional 2-stroke engine uses the upward movement of piston to suck air in the crank case and then downward movement of piston to transfer the air from case to combustion chamber. In a G-stroke engine air is forced into a reservoir called inlet canal (item 5) by a fan (item 6) mounted on the crank shaft (item 7). Air pushed by the fan (item 6) is always available in the inlet canal at a pressure which is higher than the atmospheric pressure. An inlet valve (item 3) controls the movement of air in to the combustion chamber. Opening and closing of the inlet valve is controlled by a cam (item 9) mounted on the crank shaft (item 7) through a push rod (item 10). Inlet valve operating mechanism and components are generally the same as used in a 4-stroke engine. Position of exhaust port and mechanism to open and close the exhaust port (item 11) generally remains the same as in a 2-stroke engine. Metered quantity of fuel is injected in combustion chamber by an electronic fuel injection unit (EFI Unit) (item 1) at a predetermined position of the piston after the exhaust port is closed.<br>
Just before the piston reaches the top dead center, spark plug (item2) fires and ignites<br>
the mixture causing combustion to take place. Heat and pressure is generated and the<br>
piston starts moving down, causing the crank shaft to rotate and engine to produce<br>
power. Just before the piston reaches the BDC, say at 155° rotation of cranks<br>
shaft, the exhaust port opens and the burnt gases start escaping out. A little later<br>
say at 160° the inlet valve opens allowing the fresh air stored under pressure in<br>
the inlet canal to fill the combustion chamber and expel the burnt gases. As the<br>
piston crosses the BDC and starts moving up say at 205° rotation of crank shaft<br>
the exhaust port closes and a little later say at 210° the inlet valve also closes<br>
allowing the fresh air entrapped in the combustion chamber to be compressed by<br>
upward movement of piston. As the compression begins, fuel is injected in the<br>
compression chamber, while the pressure of air in combustion chamber is still<br>
relatively low. This strategy is adapted to avoid use of expensive high pressure<br>
injection equipment and also allow adequate time for the fuel to mix with air to<br>
form a near homogeneous mixture. Just before the piston reaches the TDC<br>
and   the   compression  of mixture  is just about to	complete,	the<br>
spark plug fires    causing     the mixture       to	ignite.    The cycle repeats<br>
-5-<br><br>
and the engine produces one power stroke at every revolution of crank shaft, as in case of a 2-stroke engine. Lubrication of rotating and moving parts in the crank case in done by storing lubricating oil in the crank case (item 8) like in a 4-stroke engine.<br>
Inlet air valve operation may also be done by employing a fast response electrical solenoid (item 9) as shown in enclosed sketch No. 2.<br>
The present invention 'G-stroke engine' has many advantages over the conventional spark ignition internal combustion engines. It comprises advantages of both the 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines, and at the same time, eliminates drawbacks of the same. Some of the advantages are as mentioned in the paragraphs that follow.<br>
G-stroke engine is smaller and lighter than a 4-stroke engine for same power output. This will inturn reduce the size and weight of the vehicle. Because the fresh air is pushed in the combustion chamber at a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure, the system works like a supercharged engine. This allows larger mass (quantity) of air to be pushed in the combustion chamber and hence larger quantity of fuel can be burnt. This can produce higher power output that a normal 2-stroke engine of same piston displacement, (displacement is piston area multiplied by piston travel) thus the power density of a G-stroke engine can be even better than a 2-stroke engine. As the burnt gases (exhaust gas) are pushed out by incoming air under pressure flushing of combustion chamber is., better. Combustion chamber surfaces are maintained cleaner and hence improved durability. As the rotating and moving components in the crank case are lubricated by the oil stored in crank case, no oil is mixed with the charge and burnt in combustion chamber. This will eliminate production of soot and particulate matter (PM) in the exhaust gases which is draw back with 2-stroke engine. This will result into reduced pollution. As no oil is burnt in the combustion chamber, oil consumption is  reduced  and  carbon   deposit   in   the exhaust port, which   is a    common<br>
-6-<br><br>
occurrence in 2-stroke engine, is eliminated. This reduces operating cost, improves engine life and also reduces engine maintenance cost. As no oil is mixed in the charge oil carry over in the exhaust is eliminated. This will enhance the life of catalytic converter if fitted in the exhaust system. Fuel efficiency of G-stroke engine is expected to be better than a 2-stroke engine with electronic engine management and direct injection fuel system, as the engine is partially supercharged and exhaust gas scavenging is much superior. Exhaust gas emissions from G-stroke engine are expected to be lower than a 2-stroke engine with electronic engine management and direct injection fuel system, as no oil is burnt in the combustion chamber, the engine is partially supercharged and exhaust gas scavenging is much superior. Optimization of engine power curve, fuel efficiency exhaust emission can be further improved by employing an electronically controlled inlet valve, as against a mechanically operated inlet valve.<br>
