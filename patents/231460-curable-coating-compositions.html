BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to curable coating<br>
compositions which when cured are substantially transparent<br>
and exhibit resistance to markings such as graffiti and<br>
scuffing and particulate buildup. In particular, the<br>
compositions of the present invention when cured provide<br>
protective coatings to surfaces to prevent absorption<br>
and/or wetting of ink compositions. The invention<br>
composition may also be used as mold release agents.<br>
Brief Description Of Related Technology<br>
[0002] Graffiti is understood to mean any unwanted<br>
markings on a surface, such as a building structure.<br>
Typically, it refers to unwanted paintings, words, and<br><br>
drawings. Such markings usually are applied by paints,<br>
such as spray paint, magic markers, or other inks. Paints<br>
are the most common source of graffiti, especially oil-<br>
based paints, such as enamels, epoxies, lacquers, and<br>
urethanes. Unwanted markings, however, may be produced by<br>
a variety of other sources, such as grease, crayons, and<br>
lipstick, among others.<br>
[0003] Graffiti continues to be a problem of significant<br>
concern in today's society. Rather than a form of art,<br>
graffiti is considered vandalism and is an irritating<br>
eyesore in both public and private places. Graffiti<br>
decreases the value of private properties and drives<br>
customers away from businesses. It often defaces public<br>
buildings and institutions, such as schools, trains and<br>
buses, as well as their stations, public restrooms, park<br>
structures, bridges, and tunnels, among many others.<br>
[0004] A number of conventional cleaning techniques have<br>
been utilized to deal with the graffiti problem. These<br>
techniques typically involve cleaning the surface after it<br>
has been defaced by graffiti. Such cleaning techniques<br>
include sandblasting, sanding, high pressure power washing,<br>
and chemical treatments, among other similar procedures.<br>
Examples of cleaning compositions developed for removing<br>
graffiti are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,024,780 (Leys).<br>
[0005] These cleaning methods, however, are costly and<br>
time-consuming. The cleaned or treated surface often is<br>
deteriorated by the harsh cleansing or chemicals. As a<br>
result, the surface has to be restored and repainted at<br>
high costs. Moreover, chemical treatment procedures often<br>
involve harsh, environmentally harmful chemicals, which<br>
pose dangers to human contact.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The inventive compositions are curable<br>
compositions, which when cured impart mark resistant<br>
properties to a surface, and which make graffiti removal<br>
much easier than known coatings which share substantial<br>
transparency.<br>
[0010] The inventive compositions also reduce the<br>
tendency of particulate buildup on surfaces coated<br>
therewith.<br>
[0011] In one aspect of the invention, the inventive<br>
compositions are curable (such as by exposure to moisture)<br>
and include a functionalized siloxane (such as a hydroxy<br>
terminated one); at least one agent selected from a multi-<br>
functional silane, an amino functional silane, an enoxy<br>
functional silane, a silazane, and combinations thereof;<br>
and optionally, a carrier. Upon moisture cure at ambient<br>
temperature graffiti markings made on a surface coated with<br>
such a composition are readily removable.<br>
[0012] Another aspect of the present invention is<br>
directed to a method for imparting mark-resistant<br>
properties to a surface once cured. The method includes<br>
the steps of applying a film coating of an inventive<br>
composition to a surface to inhibit graffiti markings or<br>
other scuff markings thereon, and exposing the film coating<br>
to moisture at ambient temperature to cure the composition.<br>
[0013] Further aspect of the present invention is<br>
directed to a method for imparting particulate buildup-<br>
resistant properties to a surface. The method includes the<br>
steps of applying a film coating of an inventive<br>
composition to a surface to inhibit the buildup of<br>
particulate matter thereon once cured, and exposing the<br><br>
film coating to moisture at ambient temperature to cure the<br>
composition.<br>
[0014] Further aspect of the present invention is<br>
directed to a method for using the inventive composition as<br>
a mold release agent. The method includes the steps of<br>
applying a film coating of an inventive composition to a<br>
surface of a mold and exposing the film coating to moisture<br>
at ambient temperature to cure the composition.<br>
[0015] A still further aspect of the present invention<br>
is directed to a method for preparing the inventive<br>
composition. This method includes the step of combining<br>
with mixing a functionalized siloxane with a crosslinker,<br>
optionally in a carrier, thereby forming the inventive<br>
composition.<br>
[0016] The inventive compositions confer one or more of<br>
the following benefits and advantages when cured beyond<br>
mark resistance and particulate buildup resistance, high<br>
gloss retention and clear or invisible on the substrate<br>
surface (that is, substantial transparency when cured).<br>
The inventive compositions are also appropriate for use on<br>
most smooth surfaces, fast curing at room temperature (
minutes), semi-permanent, UV and weather stable, one-<br>
component (no mixing required by the end user) and low<br>
surface tension [thus appropriate for use with a wide<br>
variety of substrates (even polyolefins, to which are<br>
ordinarily difficult to apply a coating)].<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] The present invention is directed to curable<br>
compositions, which upon cure are substantially transparent<br>
and are resistant to markings, such as graffiti and<br>
scuffing, and repel the collection of dust and dirt thereby<br>
preventing buildup thereof on surfaces of substrates to<br>
which has been applied the curable compositions. Graffiti<br>
or scuff markings made on surfaces coated with these<br>
compositions are removable by wiping or with other similar<br>
conventional means.<br>
[0022] The compositions cure by exposure to moisture at<br>
ambient temperature to form a film coating, imparting mark<br>
resistant and/or particulate buildup resistant properties<br>
to surfaces. The compositions are also useful as a mold<br>
release agent.<br>
[0023] The term "cure" or "curing," as used herein,<br>
refers to a change in state, condition, and/or structure in<br>
a material that is usually, but not necessarily, induced by<br>
at least one variable, such as time, temperature, moisture,<br>
radiation, presence and quantity in such material of a<br>
curing catalyst or accelerator, or the like. The terms<br>
cover partial as well as complete curing. The mechanisms<br>
by which compositions of this invention may cure include,<br>
in the context of silicone chemistry, addition cure (such<br><br>
as by way of hydrosilation reactions), condensation cure<br>
(in which crosslinking of silanol, silazane, enoxy, alkoxy,<br>
acetoxy, and the like groups occur), ring opening cure, UV<br>
cure (such as by way of silylene reactions), and of course<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0024] The inventive compositions include broadly a<br>
functionalized siloxane and a crosslinker, together with<br>
one or more of the following optional components catalyst,<br>
carrier, filler, plasticizer, color indicator, and<br>
surfactant.<br>
[0025] Whether the cure mechanism is by way of a<br>
condensation cure, addition cure or UV cure, the base<br>
polymer may be a branched or linear siloxane and/or<br>
functionalized siloxane within following structure:<br><br>
where the number of repeating units, "n", plays a role in<br>
determining the molecular weight and the viscosity of the<br>
composition. R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 may be the same or<br>
different and may be siloxane, alkyl, allyl, aryl, alkoxy,<br>
amino, hydroxyl, hydrogen, mercapto, halo, and cyano, and n<br>
is from 0 to about 100,000. P1 and P2 may be the same or<br>
different and may be alkyl, allyl, hydroxyl, hydrogen,<br>
amino, acetoxy, alkoxy, enoxy, and oxime. Interruption of<br>
the polymer chain by a heteroatom is also within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
[0026] The crosslinker for condensation cure reactions<br>
include functionalized silanes, such as<br>
cyclic/linear/branched silicone oligomers that have at<br>
least two reactive functionalities. The reactive<br>
functionality include silazane, silanol, alkoxy, acetoxy,<br>
amino, oximino, amido, and enoxy groups or combinations<br>
thereof. For addition cure reactions, the functionality<br>
includes allyl, alkyl, hydride groups or combinations<br>
thereof. For UV cure reactions, the functionality include<br>
allyl, alkyl, mercapto, and (meth)acryloxy groups or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0027] The compositions of the present invention may<br>
also include a catalyst for accelerating or otherwise<br>
promoting the cure process, such as with condensation<br>
reactions. In such case, the catalyst may be chosen from<br>
an organic tin, titanium compound, and strong Lewis bases.<br>
Generally, the catalyst is present from about 0% to about<br>
0.5% (w/w). This concentration, however, can be varied<br>
depending upon the particular components chosen, the<br>
desired cure mechanism and the desired cure rate.<br>
[0028] Carriers for the composition may be included, if<br>
desired. In such case, the carrier may be chosen from<br>
organic solvents (such as aliphatic hydrocarbons containing<br>
8 to 12 carbon atoms and aromatic hydrocarbons containing 8<br>
to 12 carbon atoms), low molecular weight siloxanes (such<br>
as siloxanes containing 2 to 6 silicone atoms and cyclic<br>
siloxanes containing 3 to 5 silicone atoms), water, aerosol<br>
propellants (whether chlorinated fluorocarbons or not, such<br>
as propane), and supercritical CO2 fluid. In addition, low<br>
VOC solvents may be used to prepare the inventive<br>
compositions; low VOC formulations have 
volatile organic solvents. Carriers may be present in the<br>
inventive compositions, for example, in an amount from<br>
about 10% to about 90% (w/w). Desirably, carriers are<br>
present in an amount from about 60% to about 85%(w/w).<br>
[0029] Fillers may be included, such as for the purpose<br>
of enhancing the durability of the coating. Suitable<br>
fillers include silicas, such as treated silicas, clays, MQ<br>
resins (as are known in the art), and titanium oxide.<br>
[0030] Plasticizers may also be included to impart a<br>
degree of modulus, if desired. Suitable plasticizers<br>
include inert oligomeric or polymeric compounds, desirably<br>
such compounds are compatible with the cross-linkable base<br>
polymers mentioned above. Preferably these plasticizers<br>
are less compatible with the crosslinked base polymers;<br>
thus, a portion of the plasticizer may be capable of<br>
migrating to the surface of the cured coating. These<br>
plasticizers include for instance polydialkylsiloxanes,<br>
branched polydialkylsiloxanes, polyfluorinated<br>
dialkylsiloxanes, and organofunctional polyalkylsiloxanes.<br>
[0031] A color indicator such as pigments, dyes, and<br>
trace UV dyes may be added where a color is desirable for<br>
the composition.<br>
[0032] A surfactant may also be desirable where surface<br>
wetting and film formation characters should be modified.<br>
Surfactants may be chosen from ionic and non-ionic ones,<br>
depending of course on the particular set of physical<br>
properties sought in the specific application.<br>
[0033] A charge dispenser may be useful in some cases to<br>
eliminate static charger on a treated surface so less<br>
particle matter, such as dust or undesired objects, is<br>
attracted to the surface.<br><br>
[0034] For addition cure reactive compositions (sucn as<br>
moisture curable compositions), the above optional<br>
components may be included, though the catalyst will be<br>
organic compounds of platinum, titanium, tin, zirconium and<br>
of course combinations thereof. Tetraisopropoxytitanate<br>
and tetrabutoxytitanate are particularly desirable. See<br>
also U.S. Patent No. 4,111,890, the disclosure of which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference. Examples of<br>
such organic platinum catalysts include platinum divinyl<br>
complex (available commercially from UCT, Pennsylvania and<br>
Gelest, Pennsylvania).<br>
[0035] For UV cure reactive compositions, the above<br>
optional components may include, though the catalyst will<br>
be an UV initiator. Examples of such UV initiators include<br>
photoinitiators available commercially from Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemiclas under the "IRGACURE" and "DAROCUR" tradenames,<br>
specifically "IRGACURE" 184 (1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl<br>
ketone), 907 (2-methyl-l-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-<br>
morpholino propan-1-one), 369 (2-benzyl-2-N,N-<br>
dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl)-1-butanone), 500 (the<br>
combination of 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone and<br>
benzophenone), 651 (2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone),<br>
1700 (the combination of bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl-2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl pentyl) phosphine oxide and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-<br>
phenyl~propan-l-one), and 819 [bis(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl)<br>
phenyl phosphine oxide] and "DAROCUR" 1173 (2-hydroxy-2-<br>
methyl-1-phenyl-l-propane) and 4265 (the combination of<br>
2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenyl-phosphine oxide and 2-<br>
hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-l-one); and the visible<br>
light [blue] photoinitiators, dl-camphorquinone and<br><br>
"IRGACURE" 784DC. Of course, combinations of these<br>
materials may also be employed herein.<br>
[0036] For ring opening cure reactive compositions, the<br>
above optional components may be included, though the<br>
catalyst will be an acid or a base. Examples of such acid<br>
or base catalysts include sulfuric acid and potassium<br>
hydroxide, respectively.<br>
[0037] The base curable polymer may be formed through a<br>
ring opening reaction with chemicals such as<br>
silacyclopropane [R1R2Si (CH2CH2) ] or silacyclobutane<br>
R1R2Si (CH2CH2CH2), where R1 and R2 can be the same or<br>
different and may be selected from H, and alkyl and allyl<br>
groups.<br>
[0038] The reactive functionality on the crosslinker for<br>
ring opening cure include halide (such as chloride), alkoxy<br>
(such as methoxy), cyano, silanol or combinations thereof.<br>
[0039] Particularly desirable functionalized siloxanes<br>
for the base curable component include any conventional<br>
hydroxy terminated siloxane, or polysiloxane, which is<br>
capable of forming film coating upon combination with an<br>
appropriate crosslinker. Such hydroxy terminated<br>
polysiloxanes are represented by the following general<br>
formula: <br>
where R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 may be the same or different<br>
and may desirably be C1-6 alkyl and n is from 1 to about<br>
30,000 amu. Interruption of the polymer chain by a hetero<br><br>
atom other than oxygen is also within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0040] An example of a specific hydroxy terminated<br>
polysiloxane that may be used to form structure I is<br>
hydroxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane ("PDMS"), as<br>
represented by structural formula II:<br><br>
[0041] The number of repeating units, "n", plays a role<br>
in determining the molecular weight and the viscosity of<br>
the composition. Thus, n is an integer from about 1 to<br>
about 30,000 amu. Desirably, PDMSs incorporated into the<br>
compositions of the present invention have a molecular<br>
weight of 4,000 amu or greater. The molecular weight of<br>
PDMS, however, may vary depending upon the desired<br>
thickness and/or viscosity of the film coating as applied<br>
to a surface. Viscosities of the compositions of the<br>
present invention generally are typically less than 2000<br>
cps, and desirably are less than 500 cps.<br>
[0042] Functionalized siloxanes, such as PDMSs, may be<br>
present in the inventive compositions, for example, in an<br>
amount from about 0.001% to about 50% by weight in the<br>
final composition (w/w). Desirably, PDMSs are present in<br>
an amount from about 0.01% to about 3% (w/w).<br>
[0043] The compositions of the present invention also<br>
include as noted above a crosslinker to produce<br>
crosslinking with the polysiloxane and/or with itself, as<br>
well as compositions that interact with a surface material.<br><br>
Crosslinking is the attachment of two or more chains of<br>
polymers by, for example, bridges and cross bridges,<br>
comprising either an element, a group, or a compound. The<br>
crosslinking agent functions as a chemical group that can<br>
chemically interact with the functional siloxane as well as<br>
the residue functional group on a surface. The interaction<br>
of the crosslinking group promotes the chemical bonding of<br>
the anti-graffiti coating to the surface so that the<br>
coating can last longer in a given environment. The<br>
crosslinking reactions will initiate as soon as the<br>
inventive composition is exposed to moisture. Certain<br>
crosslinking agents unexpectedly have been found to provide<br>
curing properties, which in combination with hydroxy<br>
terminated polysiloxanes produce compositions having when<br>
cured in less than 30 minutes under ambient conditions<br>
anti-graffiti or anti-scuffing and/or anti-particulate<br>
buildup properties, while retaining substantial<br>
transparency yielding high gloss.<br>
[0044] Suitable crosslinkers, which when combined with<br>
the siloxane have been found to produce mark resistant<br>
and/or particulate buildup resistant coatings that are<br>
substantially transparent when cured, include certain<br>
multi-functional silanes, such as amino functional silanes,<br>
hydride functional silanes and enoxy functional silanes,<br>
silazanes, and combinations thereof. Upon mixing with<br>
appropriate polysiloxanes, these agents provide curing<br>
properties and produce compositions that inhibit markings<br>
and particulate buildup, as well as provide substantial<br>
transparency yielding excellent gloss retention.<br>
[0045] Organofunctional silanes, within the class of<br>
silicon hydride compounds are known for their ability to<br><br>
assist in the bonding of organic polymers to inorganic<br>
substrate materials. The compositions of the present<br>
invention may include amino and/or enoxy functional<br>
silanes. An example of an amino functional silane that may<br>
be used in accordance with the present invention is<br>
represented by structural formula III:<br><br>
[0046] Other suitable amino functional silanes include<br>
di- or tri-amino functional silanes, such as CH3Si(NHCH3)3.<br>
[0047] An example of an enoxy functional silane that may<br>
be employed in the compositions of the present invention is<br>
represented by structural formula IV:<br><br>
[0048] The incorporation of amino and/or enoxy<br>
functional silanes in the compositions of the present<br>
invention have been found to provide excellent anti-<br>
graffiti, anti-scuffing and anti-particulate buildup<br>
properties, when combined with hydroxy terminated<br>
polysiloxanes. Certain other functional silanes,<br>
particularly ethoxy functional silanes and epoxy functional<br>
silanes, do not exhibit as useful anti-graffiti and/or<br>
release properties when used alone in the compositions of<br>
the present invention. Ethoxy and epoxy functional<br>
silanes, however, may be useful when combined into other<br><br>
structures, for example, as a functional group in a ladder<br>
structure silazane.<br>
[0049] Desirable silazanes for incorporation in the<br>
compositions of the present invention include cyclic<br>
silazanes and ladder structure silazanes. Silazane<br>
compounds contain alternating silicon and nitrogen atoms.<br>
Cyclic silazanes contain one or more closed rings. An<br>
example of a cyclic silazane is represented by the<br>
following general formula V:<br><br>
[0050] One particularly desirable cyclic silazane is<br>
tris cyclo silazane, represented by structural formula VI:<br><br>
[0051] Also desirable as silazanes in accordance with<br>
the present invention are ladder structure silazanes.<br>
Ladder structure silazanes contain linear chains that<br>
crosslink in ladder-like formations. Structural formula<br>
VII represents a ladder structure silazane suitable for use<br>
in the compositions of the present invention. Other<br>
similar ladder structure silazanes, however, also may be<br>
suitable for use in these compositions. Formula VII is<br>
represented by:<br><br><br>
where each R is independently methyl or ethyl, y ranges<br>
from about 20% to about 80% of the compound, z ranges from<br>
about 0% to about 40% of the compound, and n is from 1 to<br>
about 500.<br>
[0052] The ladder structure silazane of formula VII is<br>
derived from a linear chain silazane compound, which is<br>
represented by structural formula VIII:<br><br>
where each R is independently methyl or ethyl, x ranges<br>
from about 20% to about 50% of the compound, y ranges from<br>
about 20% to about 80% of the compound, and z ranges from<br>
about 0% to about 40% of the compound.<br>
[0053] Upon addition of ammonia, the ladder-type<br>
structure of formula VII is formed. In particular,<br>
ammonium chloride is generated as a by-product of the<br>
reaction, which causes in situ formation of the ladder<br>
structure. The "x" portion of the structure of formula<br>
VIII crosslinks, while the "y" and "z" portions remain in<br><br>
linear chains. Due to their in situ formation, a ladder<br>
structure silazane used in the compositions of the present<br>
invention is a mixture of the compounds of formula VII and<br>
VIII.<br>
[0054] Desirable crosslinkers may be present in the<br>
inventive compositions, for example, in an amount from<br>
about 0.1% to about 50% (w/w). Desirably, crosslinking<br>
agents are present in an amount from about 1% to about 15%<br>
(w/w).<br>
[0055] Any conventional catalyst may be employed<br>
provided the desired properties of the inventive<br>
compositions are not compromised. Suitable catalysts that<br>
may be used include conventional organometallic catalysts,<br>
such as organic titanium derivatives, organic tin.<br>
[0056] A particularly desirable inventive composition<br>
combining these components includes: about 0.01% to about<br>
5% of tris cyclo silazane; about 0.005% to about 1% of<br>
hydroxy terminated polysiloxane; and the balance, up to<br>
about 99%, of a carrier, is a solvent.<br>
[0057] Another desirable inventive composition includes:<br>
about 0.5% to about 5% of a ladder structure silazane;<br>
about 5% to about 30% of an amino functional silane; about<br>
0.01% to about 5% of a hydroxy terminated polysiloxane; and<br>
the balance being a carrier, which includes a solvent.<br>
Other desirable compositions are set forth in Table 3.<br>
[0058] Upon application to a surface, the inventive<br>
compositions moisture cure (desirably in less than 30<br>
minutes at ambient temperature) to form film coatings,<br>
which are resistant to markings, such as graffiti or<br>
scuffing, as well as particulate buildup, and are<br><br>
substantially transparent and retain their gloss. The<br>
application of heat is not necessary to effect curing.<br>
[0059] These film coatings desirably have a thickness of<br>
less than 2.5 microns as applied to a surface. To enhance<br>
the aesthetic effects of the compositions as applied to a<br>
surface, the compositions may further include an alkoxy<br>
silane prepolymer resin and/or an alkoxy functional<br>
prepolymer resin, also referred to as an MQ resin (as such<br>
resins are known in the art). Such resins improve the ease<br>
of application and/or the surface finish of the film<br>
coatings, providing a glossy appearance. The glossier<br>
finish may be desirable for a variety of applications, such<br>
as for coating the side panels of buses and trains.<br>
Generally, concentrations of from about 0% to about 5%<br>
(w/w) are sufficient.<br>
[0060] The present invention also is directed to methods<br>
of imparting to a surface mark-resistant and particulate<br>
buildup-resistant properties. According to these methods,<br>
a film coating of the inventive composition is applied to a<br>
surface to inhibit graffiti markings or other scuff<br>
markings thereon, or particulate buildup thereon.<br>
[0061] The inventive composition may be applied by<br>
wiping or spraying it onto the desired surface, or by any<br>
other suitable means, to form a film coating on the<br>
surface. A single coat usually will be sufficient,<br>
however, additional coats may be applied, as desired. For<br>
example, it may be desirable to apply several coats of the<br>
inventive composition on rougher surfaces. If multiple<br>
coats are applied, curing may desirably be permitted<br>
between each application.<br><br>
[0062] Other application methods for the inventive<br>
compositions include spraying (such as by aerosol or pump<br>
driven), wiping, brushing, dipping, and rolling.<br>
[0063] After application to the surface, the inventive<br>
composition in film form is exposed to moisture at ambient<br>
temperature to cure the composition. Cure ordinarily<br>
occurs in less than 30 minutes, and desirably does so.<br>
Although heat could be applied, it is not necessary to<br>
effect curing sometimes in as short as about 5 to about 20<br>
minutes. The cure time, however, may be even shorter upon<br>
addition of certain appropriate catalysts, as described<br>
above. Once cured, any graffiti or other scuff markings<br>
created on the surface are easily removable by wiping or<br>
with other conventional means, and particulate buildup over<br>
time is seen to be dramatically less.<br>
[0064] The inventive compositions when used as mold<br>
release agents desirably cure to a high durability finish<br>
that permits a number of releases without contaminating a<br>
released part by transfer of the release composition from<br>
the mold to the part. In addition, in some embodiments,<br>
the coating may desirably cure to a high gloss finish that<br>
permits a number of releases without measurable loss of<br>
initial gloss value. For example, the compositions of the<br>
present invention may cure to a finish having a gloss value<br>
of at least 80 as measured by a 60 degree gloss meter.<br>
After a number of releases, such as, for example at least<br>
five releases, this gloss value remains nearly the same.<br>
In addition, the finish remains sufficiently durable after<br>
the at least five releases such that the mold release<br>
composition has not transferred to the part.<br><br>
[0065] Thus, the invention provides a method of<br>
imparting mark-resistant properties to a surface. The<br>
steps of this method include: applying a film coating of<br>
the inventive composition to a surface to inhibit markings<br>
thereon; and exposing the film coating to conditions<br>
appropriate to cure the composition.<br>
[0066] The invention also provides a method of imparting<br>
particulate repellent properties to a surface. The steps of<br>
this method include: applying a film coating of the<br>
inventive composition to a surface to inhibit particulate<br>
buildup thereon; and exposing the film coating to<br>
conditions appropriate to cure the composition.<br>
[0067] Of course, a mark-resistant film comprising the<br>
reaction product of the inventive composition and a<br>
particulate buildup film wherein the composition comprising<br>
the reaction product of the inventive composition,<br>
respectively, are also provided by the invention.<br>
[0068] And the invention provides a method of enhancing<br>
the gloss value of a part molded in a mold coated with a<br>
cured mold release composition to at least 80. The steps<br>
of this method include: applying a film coating of a mold<br>
release composition to a surface in a mold; and exposing<br>
the film coating to conditions appropriate to cure the<br>
composition.<br>
[0069] End user market opportunities for the inventive<br>
compositions include beyond mold release agents,<br>
infrastructure (such as application on the surfaces of road<br>
signs, school busses, mailboxes, bridges, and tunnels);<br>
automotive aftermarket type market applications (such as<br>
wheels and wheel wells, front fascia and trims, windshield<br>
and side windows and under carriage); construction (such as<br><br>
inside the dwelling like bathrooms, lockers and windows,<br>
and the exterior of the dwelling to maintain the appearance<br>
of the dwelling); engine compartment; maintenance, repair<br>
and operations ("MRO") type market applications (such as<br>
paint booths and selective masking); vehicular assembly<br>
(such as for all exposed components in the engine<br>
compartment for overall cleanliness exciter/toner/ABS<br>
rings, sensors, and radiators for cleanliness and heat<br>
management and related equipment (such as busses (like<br>
school or commuter), trains/subways cars, trucks and<br>
trailers, and boats); mold release agents for use with<br>
polyesters and epoxy parts and other composites; and<br>
additive for paint formulations.<br>
[0070] Additional end user automotive after market<br>
opportunities include wipe versions, such as for coating<br>
wheel rims to protect them from brake dust or for coating<br>
the windshield.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
[0071] This example describes a formulation of<br>
components used to make a composition of the present<br>
invention. Table 1 depicts the weight percent of each of<br>
the following components in the composition: tris cyclo<br>
silazane; hydroxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane; and as a<br>
solvent, a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms.<br><br><br>
[0072] The components were mixed well in the hydrocarbon<br>
solvent under nitrogen conditions to prevent the<br>
introduction of moisture into the composition. The<br>
resulting composition (Sample No. 1) was applied to a<br>
surface by either wiping or spraying to form a film<br>
coating. The coating was exposed to atmoshereic moisture<br>
at ambient temperature for about 5 to 20 minutes to effect<br>
curing.<br>
[0073] FTIR spectra of both the cured and uncured<br>
compositions are depicted in Figs, 1a and 1b respectively.<br>
The peak of about 950 cm"1 in Fig. lb shows the presence of<br>
a silazane functional group. The FTIR of the cured film<br>
(Fig. la peaks at about 800 cm-1, 1020 cm-1, 1100 cm-1, and<br>
1260 cm-1) indicates that all silazane functional groups are<br>
consumed. The nature of the cured coating is a crosslinked<br>
polysiloxane.<br>
[0074] A BYK Gardner 60 degree micro-gloss meter was<br>
used to measure part gloss. A clean substrate constructed<br>
from polyester gel coat surface has an average gloss value<br>
of 91.8. Sample No. 1 demonstrated a glossy finish on the<br>
coated surface with an average gloss value of 85.0, which<br>
is only a reduction in gloss value of 6.8 units or 7.4%.<br>
[0075] Tests referred to as scrape and tape were<br>
designed to evaluate graffiti cleanability by mechanical<br>
removal.<br><br>
[0076] The scrape and tape tests were conducted by<br>
coating a smooth surface with an inventive composition.<br>
The two surfaces used in our tests were gray or orange gel<br>
coat boards and Imron painted steel panels. One coat of<br>
each composition was spray or wiped applied to the smooth<br>
surface and allowed to cure. Spray paint was applied over<br>
the coating and allowed to dry for more than 12 hours.<br>
[0077] In the scrape test, a wooden applicator was used<br>
to scrape the painted surfaces and evaluation of graffiti<br>
removal was defined by visual inspection.<br>
[0078] In the tape test, a scotch brand tape was used on<br>
the painted surface. Cleanabilities of both methods were<br>
rated on a scale of 1-6. On this scale 1= 0% paint<br>
cleaned, 2= ≤5% cleaned, 3= 6-49% cleaned, 4 = 50-94%<br>
cleaned, 5= ≥95% cleaned and 6= 100% cleaned.<br>
[0079] The anti-graffiti rating was measured to be 5,<br>
irrespective of which test was used.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0080] This example describes another formulation of<br>
components used to make a composition of the present<br>
invention. Table 2 depicts the weight percent of each of<br>
the following components in the composition: a ladder<br>
structure silazane; an amino functional silane; hydroxy<br>
terminated polydimethylsiloxane; and a mixture of aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons containing 8 and 12 carbon atoms.<br><br><br>
[0081] The components were mixed well in the solvent<br>
under nitrogen conditions to prevent the introduction of<br>
moisture into the composition. The resulting composition<br>
(Sample No. 2) describes another formulation of components<br>
used to make a composition of the present invention. The<br>
composition is applied to a surface by either wiping or<br>
spraying to form a film coating. The coating is exposed to<br>
moisture at ambient temperature for about 5 to 20 minutes<br>
to effect curing.<br>
[0082] FTIR spectra of both the uncured and cured<br>
composition are depicted in Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively.<br>
The FTIR spectrum of the uncured composition in film form<br>
(Fig. 2a) provides information regarding the presence of<br>
the Si-N amino functional group (at about 1109 cm"1) and<br>
multiple silazane groups at about 810 and 840 cm"1. Fig. 2b<br>
provides information on the presence of polysiloxane.<br>
[0083] Sample No. 2 demonstrated a glossy finish. And<br>
depending on the particular functional PDMS and solvent<br>
selected one can vary the surface gloss retention observed.<br>
For example, PDMSs with lower amu lead to higher gloss<br>
retention on the surface. The average gloss value for the<br>
parts coated with the moisture cured inventive composition<br>
was 82.3 and 86.0, which is only a reduction in average<br><br>
gloss value of 9.5 and 5.8 units, respectively, or 10.3%<br>
and 6.3%, respectively.<br>
[0084] The anti-graffiti rating was measured to be 5,<br>
irrespective of which test was used. One can achieve a<br>
greater anti-graffiti rating by using PDMSs with higher amu<br>
or a blend of PDMSs with different amu.<br>
Example 3<br>
Synthesis:<br>
A.	1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethyl-2,4,6-tris(methylamino)-<br>
cyclotrisilazane ("tris cyclosilazane"):<br>
[0085] Methyl trichloro silane was reacted with methyl<br>
amine in a mixed hydrocarbon solvent under nitrogen<br>
environment in a pressured reactor. First 0.81 moles of<br>
the methyl trichloro silane was blended with 920 ml of a<br>
mixture of aromatic solvent in the reactor. Then 4.5 moles<br>
of methylamine was added to the batch slowly. The reaction<br>
temperature was increased during the amine addition. The<br>
addition of amine was completed over a 12 hour period.<br>
Slowly the excess amine was purged with dry nitrogen. Next<br>
water was added to the reaction, and the resulting<br>
suspension stirred overnight. The suspension was filtered<br>
under nitrogen, and the solution was collected as the<br>
product (in solution) without further purification. This<br>
silazane solution was used in Sample No. 3. The<br>
concentration of the final product ranged from 8-10% (w/w),<br>
as measured in percentage of product fully hydrolyzed with<br>
water.<br>
B.	Tris(methylamino) methyl silane:<br><br>
[0086] Methyl trichloro silane was reacted with methyl<br>
amine in a mixed hydrocarbon solvent under nitrogen<br>
environment in a pressured reactor. First 0.4 4 moles of<br>
the methyl trichlorosilane was blended with 1000 ml of<br>
solvent. Then the mixture was cooled to a temperature<br>
below 15°C. Methylamine (2.90 moles) was added to the<br>
batch, and the reaction temperature controlled at below<br>
20°C until the reaction was completed, which was indicated<br>
by a pressure increase inside of the reactor. The<br>
suspension which resulted was filtered under nitrogen, and<br>
the solution was collected as the product (in solution)<br>
without further purification. This silane solution was<br>
used in Sample No. 6. The concentration of the final<br>
product ranged from 4-6% (w/w) , as measured in percentage<br>
of product fully hydrolyzed with water.<br>
Formulation:<br>
[0087] Sample Nos. 3-10 were formulated using the ranges<br>
of the various components identified in Table 3a, and with<br>
those components in the amounts specified in Tables 3b and<br>
3c.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0088] The formulations were prepared by combining with<br>
mixing the various components in each sample.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0089] In Example 4, test method ASTM D 6578-00, was<br>
used to evaluate performance of the compositions. In this<br>
method, cleanability of graffiti placed on cured coatings<br>
of the inventive compositions was evaluated. Here,<br>
graffiti resistance was measured based on how a defined set<br>
of markings was removed by a defined set of cleaning<br>
agents.<br>
[0090] As a comparison, the competitive product, TK<br>
1495, available commercially from Sierra, was used. TK<br>
14 95 is reported by the manufacturer to contain among other<br>
things a homopolymer of hydroxyl diisocyanate and<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate in solvent.<br>
[0091] A general description of the methods follow. The<br>
following materials were used for testing: aluminum<br>
panels, cellulose sponge, cotton cloth, solvent-based ink<br>
markers (such as Sharpie or Marks-A-Lots brand), solvent-<br>
based spray paint (such as Krylon brand), mild detergent,<br>
citrus-based cleaner, isopropyl alcohol ("IPA") and methyl<br>
ethyl ketone ("MEK"). One coat of each sample was applied<br>
to aluminum Q-panels, and allowed to cure for 10-20 minutes<br>
at room temperature (approximately 72°F) , the precise time<br>
depending on humidity conditions. The graffiti marking<br>
materials were applied to the coated panels and allowed to<br>
dry for more than 12 hours at room temperature.<br>
[0092] One panel was used for each level of cleanability<br>
testing. Each panel was rubbed with a cotton cloth wrapped<br><br>
cellulose sponge wetted with the defined cleaning agent for<br>
25 back and forth cycles. Evaluation of graffiti removal<br>
was done by visual inspection. If the graffiti material<br>
was completely removed after 25 cycles, testing was<br>
determined to be complete and the coating was rated based<br>
on the cleaning agent used.<br>
[0093] The cleanability level ratings are as follows: 1=<br>
marking completely removed using a clean dry cotton cloth.<br>
2= cleaned with a 1% aqueous solution of mild detergent.<br>
3= cleaned with citrus cleaner (D-limonene from Florida<br>
Chemical Co). 4= cleaned with IPA. 5= cleaned with MEK.<br>
Not cleanable= MEK did not completely remove the graffiti<br>
material from the coated panel. The cleanability data of<br>
each of Samples 3-8 was observed to be 3.<br>
[0094] This method thus did not distinguish the anti-<br>
graffiti properties between the samples above and TK 14 95<br>
though significant anti-graffiti performance differences<br>
were observed as noted in the preceding paragraph.<br>
[0095] In addition, the samples did not allow the<br>
graffiti marking materials to uniformly wet out a Q-panel<br>
when first applied; the ASTM designates this as<br>
"repellent". In contrast, TK 14 95 caused the graffiti<br>
materials to wet out over the panel when first applied;<br>
therefore, it is not considered to act as a graffiti<br>
repellent. Thus, the methods described above in Example 1<br>
were used.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0097] In this example, a composition (Sample No. 7) was<br>
packaged in aerosol cans, using propane as a propellant.<br><br>
[0098] The composition was applied in aerosol form to<br>
substrates constructed from brick, glass, plastic and<br>
various metals for surface appearance observation.<br>
Acceptable surface finish on most of these materials was<br>
observed. More specifically, the aerosol appearance is<br>
listed below in Table 5 as compared with the bulk spray and<br>
wiping methods of application.<br><br>
[0099] Ten coats of Sample No. 7 were aerosol spray<br>
applied to aluminum Q-panels, allowed to dry 10 minutes<br>
after each coat and given a 10-minute final cure. Coating<br>
thickness was measured as an average of 32 readings and<br>
divided by the number of coatings that had been applied to<br>
the Q-panels. Thickness readings were taken using an<br>
Elcometer 355 digital coating thickness meter, and are<br>
recorded in Table 6.<br><br><br>
*The average thickness for each entry an average was taken as an<br>
average of 4 readings collected from 4 locations of the coated panel,<br>
namely the upper part, middle part, lower part, and every corner of the<br>
panel, and the overall thickness was calculated to be 0.061, based on<br>
the ten coats which were applied<br>
Example 6<br>
[00100] In this example, Sample Nos. 3, 6-10 and 11-16<br>
were evaluated as mold release compositions. Apart from<br>
Sample No. 12, these samples each demonstrated a gloss value<br>
retention on molded parts of at least 80.<br>
[00101] More specifically, for instance Sample No. 6<br>
demonstrated a gloss value retention of 86.3 on the molded<br>
part. And, Sample No. 3 demonstrated a gloss value<br>
retention of 85.0 on the molded part; Sample Nos. 8 and 14<br>
demonstrated a gloss value retention of 91.1 and 87.0,<br>
respectively, on the molded part; Sample Nos. 7, 13, 15 and<br>
16 demonstrated a gloss value retention of 85.9, 90.7, 83.2<br>
and 83.0, respectively, on the molded part. The<br>
releasability measurements on the molded part were conducted<br>
by pouring each sample as a freestanding puddle of about<br>
three inches in diameter and allowed to cure over a twelve<br>
hour period prior to testing for release properties.<br>
Releasability was measured by way of a qualitative scale (1-<br>
6) in which 1= did not release, 2= part broke when forcibly<br><br>
released, 3= flexing of board or heavy pressure required for<br>
release, 4= moderate pressure required for release, 5=<br>
little pressure required for release, and 6= part fell off<br>
board (as a pre-release). Sample Nos. 3 demonstrated a<br>
release value of 3; Sample Nos. 8 and 14 demonstrated a<br>
release value of 5 and 4, respectively; Sample Nos. 7, 13,<br>
15 and 16 each demonstrated a release value of 5.<br><br>
