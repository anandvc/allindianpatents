INTRODUCTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of letrozole precursor from an isomeric mixture. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor drug used in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer. The intermediate 4-[l-(l,2,4- triazolyl)methyl]benzonirile of the formula (I) is commonly employed as a precursor in the manufacture of Letrozole.<br><br>
The unwanted isomeric by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl] benzonitrile of formula (II) is invariably produced during the synthesis of the intermediate 4-[l-(1,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonirile of the formula (I) and cumbersome chromatrographic methods are used to separate the compound of the formula (I) from a mixture of the compounds of the formulae (I) and (II).<br><br>
A simple chemical method for the separation of the compound of the formula (I) from a mixture of (I) and (n) is described here.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE mVENTION<br>
Processes for separating the compounds from mixtures are of great importance, both in the laboratory and on an industrial scale. The purity of chemical compounds is dictated to a large extent by the purification step in which a compound is separated from other products of the reaction in which it is produced. The separation of a compound from its isomers can be particularly difficult to achieve. Conventional methods for separating a compound from its isomers include crystallization, chromatography, fractional distillation and the like. But these techniques can be relatively expensive and time consuming and they do not always provide a sufficiently high degree of separation.<br>
The Known method for the synthesis of the compound 4-[l-(l,2,4- triazolyl)methyl]benzonirile of the formula (I), the key intermediate useful for the manufacture of letrozole is described in EP 0236940 (1987) US 4978672 (1990) .The process disclosed in the above patents is shown below  in Fig (i) which produces isomeric mixture of two products namely compounds of the<br><br>
According to the process shown in fig (i) the reaction of refluxing alpha-bromo-4-tolunitrile of the formula (III) with 1,2,4-triazole of the formula (IV), potassium carbonate and potassium in the presence of acetone gives an isomeric mixture of 4-[l-(l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl] benzonitrile of the formula (I) and 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (II) in 87:11 ratio along with 2% other impurities. This mixture of the products of the reaction is not disclosed in the above mentioned patents, but the indicated ratio is based on our experimental observation. The desired product of the formula (I) is separated from the impurities using column<br><br>
chromatography technique The column chromatography technique of the purification of the<br>
compound of the formula I suffers from the following set backs.<br>
Column chromatography technique is not adaptable for multi kilograms level manufacture as<br>
i.	Special equipment [ columns] is to be designed in the plant.<br>
ii.        Even by employing large columns on commercial scale, a maximum of about 4 Kg of<br>
product only can be separated in one batch, requiring repeating  a number of times to<br>
manufacture the product on a muhi kilogram scale, iii.       It is very time consuming as it requires slow elution for efficient separation . iv.       It involves huge volumes of solvents which can harm the environment. V.        Solvents recovery is an important task, as inefficient solvent recovery effects the product<br>
costing considerably, vi.       Large quantity of chromatography grade adsorbant is required which effects the economy<br>
of the process, vii.       Specially  trained personnel are required to perform column chromatography technique<br>
on a manufacturing scale in the plant.<br>
The above factors render the chromatography technique of purification of the compound of the formula I is unwieldy and unviable for the adaptation of the process on a commercial scale<br>
Summary of invention<br>
Taking into consideration the above mentioned shortcomings of the chromatographic technique of purifying the compound of the formula I, our aim was directed towards developing an improved environmentally safe and industrially applicable technique, which is devoid of the insufficiencies of the known method and makes it possible the synthesis of pure desired compound namely the compound of the formula I in high yields.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted bye product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities avoiding the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes :<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities avoiding column chromatography technique<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities resulting in efficient separation by a chemical method<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities resulting in an end product having increased purity (99.7%)<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities using very mild conditions thereby making the process simple and safe<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (11) and other impurities avoiding the usage of special equipment whose procurement can be a deterrent for large scale manufacture.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyljbenzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,3,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities without using huge volumes of organic solvents thereby avoiding environmental hazards<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l,2,4-triazolyl)methyI]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,354-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities avoiding additional purification step and reducing operational time thereby making the process economical.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the separation of letrozole precursor 4-[l-l52,4-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of the formula (I) from the isomeric unwanted by product 4-[l-(l,354-triazolyl)methyl]benzonitrile of formula (II) and other impurities which does not require employment of specially trained personnel.<br>
Accordingly we found an excellent process in which the two isomers  of formulae (I) and (II)<br>
can be  separated  efficiently  by  employing  specific  solvents  and  reagents  in particular<br>
proportions.   Further we emphasize that this purification process is possible only with below<br>
mentioned solvents in that particular proportions.<br>
