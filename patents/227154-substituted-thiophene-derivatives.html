2,4-dichloro-3N-(4-chloro-2-benzimidazolylamino)thiophene<br>
and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, for example the hydrochloride or the<br><br>
hydrobromide or the methanesulfonate of each of the compounds.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be present in the form of their salts. Suitable acid addition salts are salts of all pharmacologically acceptable acids, for example halides, in particular hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, lactates, sulfates, citrates, tartrates, acetates, phosphates, methylsulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, adipinates, fumarates, gluconates, glutamates, glycerophosphates, maleates, benzoates, oxalates and pamoates. This group also corresponds to the physiologically acceptable anions; but also trifluoroacetates. If the compounds contain an acid group, they are capable of forming salts with bases, for example as alkali metal salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, or as ammonium salts, for example as salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids. They can also be present as zwitterion.<br>
If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, the compounds can independently be both S- and R-configured. The compounds can be present as optical isomers, as diastereomers, as racemates or as mixtures thereof.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can furthermore be present as tautomers or as a mixture of tautomeric structures. This refers, for example, to the following tautomers:<br><br>
Alkyl radicals can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies when they carry substituents or are present as substituents of other radicals, for example in fluoroalkyl radicals or alkoxy radicals. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl (= 1-methylethyl), n-butyl, isobutyl (= 2-methylpropyl), sec-butyl (= 1-methyl-<br><br>
propyl), tert-butyl (= 1,1-dimethylethyl), n-pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, neopentyl or hexyl. Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl. In alkyl radicals, one or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, hydrogen atoms may be substituted by fluorine atoms. Examples of such fluoroalkyl radicals are trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluoroisopropyl. Substituted alkyl radicals may be substituted in any positions.<br>
Alkenyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This also applies when they are present as substituents, for example in alkenylalkylene. The alkenyl radicals can be unsaturated in different positions. Examples of alkenyl radicals are ethenyl, propenyl or butenyl.<br>
Alkynyl radicals can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies when they are present as substituents, for example in alkynylalkylene. The alkynyl radicals can be unsaturated in different positions. Examples of alkynyl radicals are ethynyl, propynyl or butynyl.<br>
Examples of cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Substituted cycloalkyl radicals can be substitued in any positions. The cycloalkyl radicals may also be present branched as alkylcycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl.<br>
Also described are methods for preparing compounds according to the invention. Thus, the substances described by formula I can be prepared in a manner known to the person skilled in the art from the isothiocyanate II parent compounds and the appropriate diamines III.<br><br><br>
The thiourea derivative which is formed as an intermediate is cyclized using methyliodide (Synthesis, 1974, 41 - 42) or carbodiimide (Synthesis, 1977, 864 - 865) or using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride to give the corresponding compound of the formula I. If the isothiocyanates II employed here are not commercially available, they can be prepared in a manner known from the literature from the corresponding aminothiophene derivatives, using methods known to the person skilled in the art, for example by treatment with thiophosgene (J. Med. Chem., 1975, 18, 90-99) or thiocarbonyl diimidazole (Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1962, 657, 104).<br>
In addition to the isothiocyanates II described above, it is also possible to successfully react the isocyanates IV <br>
with amines of the type of formula III to give the compounds of the formula I. Here, the urea derivative which is formed as an intermediate is cyclized using phosphorus oxychloride to give the corresponding compounds of the formula I.<br>
In the present invention, it was surprisingly possible to demonstrate that the compounds described are potent inhibitors of the sodium/proton exchanger (NHE), in particular the sodium/proton exchanger of subtype 3 (NHE3).<br>
The NHE3 inhibitors known to date are derived from compounds of the acylguanidine type (EP825178), of the norbomylamine type (DE199 60 204), of the 2-guanidino-quinazoline type (WO 0179186) or of the benzamidine type (WO0121582, WO0172742). Squalamine, which has also been described as NHE3 inhibitor (M. Donowitz et al. Am. J. Physiol. 276 (Cell Physiol. 45): C136 - C144), is, according to current understanding, not, unlike the compounds of the formula I, effective immediately, but rather via an indirect mechanism and thus reaches its maximum potency only after one hour. Such NHE3 inhibitors which act by a different mechanism<br><br>
are therefore suitable for use as combination partners for the present compounds according to the invention.<br>
Clonidine, which is similar to the compounds described here, is known as a weak NHE inhibitor. However, its action on the NHE3 of the rat is, with a half-maximal inhibitory<br>
concentration (IC50) of 620 uM, extremely moderate. In contrast, it shows a certain<br>
selectivity for the NHE2 (J. Orlowski et al. J. Biol. Chem. 268, 25536). It would therefore be more accurate to refer to clonidine as an NHE2 inhibitor. In addition to the weak NHE action, clonidine has a high affinity for the adrenergic alpha2 receptor and the imidazoline 11 receptor, mediating a strong hypotensive action (Emsberger et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 134, 1,1987).<br>
Clonidine-like compounds having a thiophene ring instead of the phenyl ring are known from DE1941761. These known compounds differ from the structures of the formula I described herein in that they have considerably smaller radicals R7 and R8 and in particular by the fact that R7 and R8 are not capable of forming a joint ring. Py these differences in the substituents R7 and R8, it is possible to eliminate the undesirable clonidine-like cardiovascular effects described above, which are mediated by the alpha-adrenoceptor action. At the same time, owing to these differences in the substituents, the NHE-inhibiting properties of the compounds described herein are enhanced to the micromolar and submicromolar range, whereas the compounds known from DE1941761 show only extremely weakly pronounced NHE-inhibiting effects, if any. Thus the main representative compound from DE1941761, the hypotensive agent thiamenidine selected as development product, has, in each case at 300/vM, no inhibiting effects on the NHE-subtypes NHE1, NHE2, NHE3 and NHE5 which were tested.<br>
Compounds of the formula I are distinguished in that they inhibit the cellular sodium/proton exchanger, and in particular by their NHE3-inhibitory action.<br>
NHE3 is found in the body of various species, preferably in the gall bladder, the intestine and the kidney (Larry Fliegel et al., Biochem. Cell. Biol. 76: 735 - 741,1998),<br><br>
but can also be detected in the brain (E. Ma et al., Neuroscience 79: 591 - 603).<br>
Owing to the NHE-inhibitory properties, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by an activation of NHE or by an activated NHE, and of diseases which are sequelae of damage caused by NHE.<br>
Since NHE inhibitors act predominantly via influencing cellular pH regulation, they can be combined in a favorable manner with other compounds which also regulate the intracellular pH, suitable combination partners being inhibitors of the enzyme group of the carbonate dehydratases, inhibitors of the bicarbonate-ion-transporting systems, such as the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) or the sodium-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE), and also NHE inhibitors having inhibitory action on other NHE subtypes, since they can modulate or enhance the pharmacologically relevant pH-regulating effects of the NHE inhibitors described herein.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention relates to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic diseases in veterinary and human medicine.<br>
The pharmacological action of the compounds of the formula I is characterized in that they induce an improvement in the respiratory drive. They can therefore be used in the treatment of disturbed respiratory conditions which may, for example, occur in the following clinical conditions and diseases: disturbed central respiratory drive (e.g. central sleep apnea, sudden infant death, postoperative hypoxia), muscular-related respiratory disorders, respiratory disorders after long-term ventilation, respiratory disorders during adaptation in a high mountain area, obstructive and mixed forms of sleep apnea, acute and chronic lung diseases with hypoxia and hypercapnia. The compounds additionally increase the muscle tone of the upper airways, so that snoring is suppressed. As a result, the compounds mentioned are advantageously used for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of sleep apnea and muscular-related respiratory disturbances and for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of snoring.<br><br>
A combination of an NHE inhibitor of the formula I with a carboanhydrase inhibitor (e.g. acetazolamide) may prove to be advantageous, the latter producing metabolic acidosis and thereby already increasing respiratory activity, as a result of which an increased action and decreased use of active compound may be achieved.<br>
Dwing to their NHE3-inhibitory action, the compounds according to the invention spare cellular energy resources which, during toxic and pathogenic events, are rapidly jepleted, thus resulting in cell damage or cell death. Here, the high-energy ATP-;onsuming resorption of sodium in the proximal tubulus is, under the influence of the compounds of the formula I, temporarily switched off, and the cell is thus able to survive an acute pathogenic, ischemic or toxic situation. The compounds are therefore suitable by way of example for use as drugs for treating ischemic noxa, for example acute kidney failure.<br>
=urthermore, the compounds are also suitable for treating all chronic renal disorders and forms of nephritis which, as a consequence of increased elimination of protein, esult in chronic kidney failure. Accordingly, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for preparing a medicament for the treatment of diabetic late damage, diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal disorders, in particular all inflammations of the kidney 'nephritides) associated with increased elimination of protein/albumin.<br>
t has been shown that the compounds used according to the invention have mild axative action and, accordingly, can also be used advantageously as laxatives or for he prophylaxis of intestinal obstruction.<br>
furthermore, the compounds according to the invention can be used advantageously or the prevention and therapy of acute and chronic disorders of the intestinal tract riggered, for example, by ischemic states in the intestinal region and/or by subsequent eperfusion or by states and events of inflammation. Such complications can occur, for sxample, by lack of intestinal peristalsis, as is frequently observed, for example, after surgical interventions, in the case of bowel obstruction or in cases of strongly reduced ntestinal motility.<br><br>
Using the compounds according to the invention, it is possible to prevent gallstone formation.<br>
The NHE inhibitors according to the invention are generally suitable for treating diseases caused by ischemia and by reperfusion.<br>
As a result of their pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use as antiarrhythmics.<br>
Owing to their cardioprotective component, the NHE inhibitors of the formula I are highly suitable for infarct prophylaxis and infarct treatment and for treatment of angina pectoris, and they also inhibit, or strongly reduce, in a preventative manner, the pathophysiological processes which contribute to ischemically induced damage, in particular those which trigger ischemically induced cardiac arrhythmias. Owing to their protective action against pathological hypoxic and ischemic situations, the compounds<br>
of the formula I used according to the invention can, as inhibitors of the cellular Na+/H+<br>
exchange mechanism, be used as medicaments for treating all acute or chronic damage caused by ischemia, or diseases induced primarily or secondarily by this damage.<br>
This relates to their use as medicaments for surgical interventions. Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used for organ transplantations, where the compounds can be used both for protecting the organs in the donor before and during removal, for protecting organs that have been removed, for example during treatment with or storage in physiological bath fluids, and also during transfer into the recipient organism pretreated with compounds of the formula I.<br>
The compounds are also useful medicaments with protective action during angioplastic surgical interventions, for example on the heart, but also in peripheral organs and vessels.<br>
Since NHE inhibitors protect human tissue and organs not only effectively against<br><br>
damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion but also against the cytotoxic action of medicaments used in particular in cancer therapy and the therapy of autoimmune diseases, the combined administration with compounds of the formula I is suitable for suppressing or reducing the cytotoxic effects of a therapy. By reducing the cytotoxic effects, in particular cardiotoxicity, by comedication with NHE inhibitors it is furthermore possible to increase the dose of the cytotoxic therapeutics and/or to prolong medication with such medicaments. The therapeutic benefit of such a cytotoxic therapy can be enhanced considerably by combination with NHE inhibitors. The compounds of the formula I are suitable in particular for improving the therapy with medicaments having an undesirable cardiotoxic component.<br>
Owing to their protective action against ischemically induced damage, the compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use as medicaments for treating ischemias of the nervous system, in particular the central nervous system, where they can be used, for example, for treating stroke or cerebral edema.<br>
The compounds of formula I are also suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases and disorders induced by overexcitability of the central nervous system, in particular for the treatment of epileptic disorders, centrally induced clonic and tonic spasms, states of psychological depression, anxiety disorders and psychoses. Here, the NHE inhibitors according to the invention can be used on their own or in combination with other substances having antiepileptic action or with antipsychotic active compounds, or carbonate dehydratase inhibitors, for example acetazolamide, and also with other inhibitors of NHE or of the sodium-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE).<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention are also suitable for treating types of shock, such as, for example, of allergic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic and bacterial shock.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also be used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders since, as NHE inhibitors, they are also capable of inhibiting<br><br>
platelet aggregation themselves. In addition, they can prevent or inhibit excessive release of mediators of inflammation and coagulation, in particular of the von Willebrand factor and thrombogenic selecting proteins which takes place following ischemia and reperfusion. It is thus possible to reduce and eliminate the pathogenic effect of significant thrombogenic factors. Accordingly, the NHE inhibitors of the present invention can be combined with other compounds having anticoagulative and/or thrombolytic action, such as, for example, recombinant or natural tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, urokinase, acetylsalicylic acid, thrombin antagonists, factor Xa antagonists, medicaments with fibrinolytic action, thromboxane receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, factor Vila antagonists, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, etc. Combined use of the present NHE inhibitors with NCBE inhibitors and/or with inhibitors of carbonate dehydratase, such as, for example, with acetazolamide, is particularly beneficial.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention have strong inhibiting action on cell proliferation, for example on fibroblast cell proliferation and proliferation of smooth vascular muscle cells. The compounds of the formula I are therefore useful therapeutics for diseases in which cell proliferation is a primary or secondary cause and can therefore be used as antiatherosclerotics, as agents against chronic kidney failure and against neoplastic diseases. Thus, they can be used for treating organ hypertrophy and hyperplasia, for example of the heart and the prostate. Compounds of the formula I are therefore suitable for the prevention and treatment of cardiac insufficiency (congestive heart failure = CHF) and for the treatment and prevention of prostate hyperplasia and prostate hypertrophy.<br>
The compounds of the formula I furthermore delay or prevent fibrotic disorders. Thus, they are excellent agents for treating fibroses of the heart, and also pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis and other fibrotic disorders.<br>
Since there is significant elevation of NHE in essential hypertensives, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure and of cardiovascular disorders.<br><br>
Here, they can be used for the treatment of high blood pressure and of cardiovascular disorders on their own or with a suitable combination and formulation cocomponent. Thus, it is possible, for example, to combine one or more diuretics having thiazide-like action, loop diuretics, aldosterone and pseudoaldosterone antagonists, such as hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, polythiazide, furosemide, piretanide, torasemide, bumetanide, amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone or eplerone, with compounds of the formula I. Furthermore, the NHE inhibitors of the present invention can be used in combination with calcium antagonists such as verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine or nifedipine, and also with ACE inhibitors, such as, for example, ramipril, enalapril, lisinopril, fosinopril or captopril. Further favorable combination partners include beta-blockers such as metoprolol, albuterol etc., antagonists of the angiotensin receptor and its receptor subtypes, such as losartan, irbesartan, valsartan, omapatrilat, gemopatrilat, endothelin antagonists, renin inhibitors, adenosine receptor agonists, inhibitors and activators of calcium channels, such as glibenclamide, glimepiride, diazoxide, cromakalim, minoxidil and its derivatives, activators of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mitoK(ATP) channel), inhibitors of other potassium channels, such as inhibitors of Kv1.5 etc.<br>
Owing to their antiphlogistic action, the NHE inhibitors can be used as antiinflammatory agents. Mechanistically interesting is the inhibition of the release of mediators of inflammation. Thus, the compounds can be used alone or in combination with an antiphlogistic agent for the prevention or treatment of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders. The combination partners used are advantageously steroidal and non¬steroidal antiinflammatory agents.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that compounds of the formula I exert a beneficial influence on serum lipoproteins. They can therefore be used for the prophylaxis and regression of atherosclerotic changes by excluding a causal risk factor. This includes not only primary hyperlipidemias but also certain secondary hyperlipidemias as are encountered, for example, in diabetes. Additionally, the compounds of the formula I reduce infarcts induced by metabolic anomalies considerably and, in particular, lead to a significant reduction in the size and severity of the infarct induced.<br><br>
Accordingly, the compounds mentioned are used advantageously for preparing a medicament for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, for preparing a medicament for the prevention of atherogenesis, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of diseases induced by elevated cholesterol levels, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of diseases induced by endothelial dysfunction, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of hypertension induced by atherosclerosis, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of thromboses induced by atherosclerosis, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of ischemic damage and post-ischemic reperfusion damage induced by hypercholesterolemia and endothelial dysfunction, for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of cardiac hypertrophies and cardiomyopathies and congestive heart failure (CHF), for preparing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of coronary vascospasms and myocardial infarcts induced by hypercholesterolemia and endothelial dysfunction, for preparing a medicament for the treatment of the conditions mentioned in combination with hypotensive substances, preferably with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. A combination of an NHE inhibitor of the formula I with an active compound that lowers the lipid concentration in the blood, preferably an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (for example lovastatin or pravastatin), the latter having hypolipidemic action, thereby enhancing the hypolipidemic properties of the NHE inhibitor of the formula I, has been found to be a favorable combination with increased action and reduced use of active compound.<br>
Thus, compounds of the formula I bring about effective protection against endothelial damage of various origins. Owing to this protection of the vessels against the syndrome of endothelial dysfunction, compounds of the formula I are useful medicaments for the prevention and treatment of coronary vascospasms, peripheral vascular diseases, in particular intermittent claudication, of atherogenesis and atherosclerosis, of left-ventricular hypertrophy and of dilated cardiomyopathy, and of thrombotic disorders.<br><br>
Moreover, NHE inhibitors of the formula I are suitable for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) where, for example, insulin resistance is suppressed. Here, to enhance antidiabetic efficacy and quality of action of the compounds according to the invention, it may be favorable to combine these compounds with a biguanide such as metformin, with an antidiabetic sulfonylurea, such as glyburide, glimepiride, tolbutamide, etc., a glucosidase inhibitor, a PPAR agonist, such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, etc., with an insulin product in a different administration form, with a DB4 inhibitor, with an insulin sensitizer or with meglitinide.<br>
In addition to the acute antidiabetic effects, the compounds of the formula I counteract the development of late complications of diabetes, and they can therefore be used as medicaments for the prevention and treatment of diabetic late damage, such as diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy and other disorders which occur as a result of diabetes. In this connection, they can be combined advantageously with the antidiabetic medicaments described above under the NIDDM treatment. A combination with a favorable administration form of insulin may be of particular importance.<br>
In addition to the protective effects against acute ischemic events and subsequent likewise acute reperfusion events, the NHE inhibitors of the formula I according to the invention also have direct therapeutically useful action against disorders and impairments of the entire mammalian organism which are associated with manifestations of the chronically progressing aging process and are also independent of acute states of hypoperfusion, and may also occur under normal, non-ischemic conditions. These pathological age-related manifestations, such as disease, illness and death, induced over the long time of aging, which are now accessible to treatment with NHE inhibitors, are disorders and disturbances caused to a substantial extent by age-related changes in vital organs and their function which become more and more important in the aging organism.<br>
Disorders associated with age-related dysfunction and age-related symptoms of wear of organs are, for example, inadequate responsiveness and reactivity of the blood vessels to contraction and relaxation reactions. This age-related decline in vascular<br><br>
reactivity to constricting and relaxing stimuli, which are an essential process of the cardiovascular system and thus of life and health, can be significantly diminished or abolished by NHE inhibitors. An important function and a measure of the maintenance of vascular reactivity is the blocking or slowing of the age-related progression of endothelial dysfunction, which can be abolished highly significantly by NHE inhibitors. The compounds of the formula I are thus outstandingly suitable for the treatment and prevention of the age-related progression of endothelial dysfunction, especially of intermittent claudication. Moreover, the compounds of the formula I are thus outstandingly suitable for the treatment and prevention of cardiac insufficiency, of congestive heart failure (CHF), and for the treatment and in particular for the prevention of age-related types of cancer.<br>
Consideration may likewise be given to combination with hypotensive medicaments, such as with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, diuretics, Ca2+ antagonists, etc., or with metabolism-normalizing medicaments, such as cholesterol-lowering agents. The compounds of the formula I are thus suitable for the prevention of age-related tissue changes and for prolonging life while maintaining a high quality of life.<br>
The compounds of the invention are effective inhibitors of the cellular sodium/proton antiporter (Na/H exchanger) which, in numerous disorders (essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, etc.), is also elevated in cells which are easily amenable to measurements, such as, for example, in erythrocytes, platelets or leukocytes. The compounds used according to the invention are therefore suitable as excellent and simple scientific tools, for example in their use as diagnostic aids for the determination and differentiation of particular types of hypertension, but also of atherosclerosis, of diabetes and of late complications of diabetes, of proliferative disorders, etc.<br>
NHE3 inhibitors are furthermore suitable for treating disorders (human and veterinary)<br>
caused by bacteria and by protozoa. In the case of disorders caused by protozoa,<br>
particular mention may be made of malaria diseases of man and of coccidiosis in<br>
poultry.<br>
Moreover, the compounds are suitable as agents for controlling sucking parasites in<br><br>
human and veterinary medicine and in crop protection. Here, the use as an agent against blood-sucking parasites in human and veterinary medicine is preferred.<br>
In addition to their value as potent NHE-inhibitors, their pharmacological properties and the absence of undesired biological actions, the compounds of the formula I are also distinguished by favorable pharmacokinetic properties which make their use as medicament seem particularly advantageous.<br>
The invention thus relates to medicaments for human, veterinary or phytoprotective use which comprise an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof alone or in combination with other pharmacologically active compounds or medicaments.<br>
Medicaments comprising a compound I can be administered, for example, orally, parenterally, intramuscularly, intravenously, rectally, nasally, by inhalation, subcutaneously or by a suitable transcutaneous administration form, with the preferred administration being dependent on the particular appearance of the disorder. Here, the compounds I can be used alone or together with pharmaceutical excipients, both in veterinary medicine and in human medicine and in crop protection.<br>
Excipients suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation are familiar to the skilled worker on the basis of his expert knowledge. Besides solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active ingredient carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, masking flavors, preservatives, solubilizers or colorants.<br>
For a form for oral use, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable for this purpose, such as carriers, stabilizers or inert diluents, and converted by conventional methods into suitable dosage forms such as tablets, coated tablets, two-piece capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of inert carriers which can be used are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, especially corn starch. Preparation can moreover take place<br><br>
both as dry and as wet granules. Examples of suitable oily carriers or solvents are vegetable or animal oils such as sunflower oil or fish liver oil.<br>
For subcutaneous, percutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds i     used are converted into a solution, suspension or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary for this purpose, such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or other excipients. Examples of suitable solvents are: water, physiological saline or alcohols, for example ethanol, propanol, glycerol, and also sugar solutions, such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or else a mixture of the various solvents mentioned. i<br>
Suitable as pharmaceutical formulation for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compound of the formula I in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents.<br>
The formulation may, if required, also comprise other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and a propellant gas. Such a preparation normally contains the active compound in a concentration of about 0.1 to 10, in particular of about 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
i     The dosage of the active compound of the formula I to be administered and the frequency of administration depend on the potency and duration of action of the compounds used; also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, and on the sex, age, weight and individual response of the mammal to be treated.<br>
On average, the daily dose of the compound of the formula I for a patient weighing about 75 kg is at least 0.001 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 30 mg/kg, preferably 1 mg/kg, of body weight. In acute situations, for example immediately after suffering high-altitude breathing disorders, it may even become necessary for the dosages to be higher. Especially on i.v. use, for example for an i     infarct patient in an intensive care unit, up to 200 mg/kg per day may be necessary. The daily dose can be divided into one or more, for example up to 4, individual doses.<br><br>

Test description:<br>
In this test, the recovery of the intracellular pH (pHi) after an acidification, which starts when the NHE is capable of functioning, even under bicarbonate-free conditions, was determined. For this purpose, the pHi was determined using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF (Calbiochem, the precursor BCECF-AM is employed). The cells were initially loaded with BCECF. The BCECF fluorescence was determined in a "ratio fluorescence spectrometer" (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, N.J., USA) with excitation wavelengths of 505 and 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm, and was converted into the pHi using calibration plots. The<br>
cells were incubated in NH4CI buffer (pH 7.4) (NH4CI buffer: 115 mM NaCI, 20 mM<br>
NH4CI, 5 mM KCI, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgS04, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml BSA; a pH of 7.4 is established with 1 M NaOH) even during the BCECF loading. The intracellular acidification was induced by addition of 975 //I of an NhUCI-free buffer (see<br>
below) to 25 //I aliquots of the cells incubated in NH4CI buffer. The subsequent rate of<br>
pH recovery was recorded in the case of NHE1 for two minutes, in the case of NHE2 for five minutes and in the case of NHE3 for three minutes. To calculate the inhibitory power of the tested substances, the cells were initially investigated in buffers in which complete or absolutely no pH recovery took place. For complete pH recovery (100%), the cells were incubated in Na+-containing buffer (133.8 mM NaCI, 4.7 mM KCI,<br>
1.25 mM CaCl2, 1 -25 mM MgCl2, 0.97 mM Na2HPC&gt;4, 0.23 mM NaH2P04) 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, a pH of 7.0 is established with 1 M NaOH). To determine the 0% value, the cells were incubated in an Na+-free buffer (133.8 mM choline chloride,<br>
4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM CaCI2, 1.25 mM MgCI2, 0.97 mM K2HP04, 0.23 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, a pH of 7.0 is established with 1 M KOH). The substances to be tested were made up in the Na+-containing buffer. Recovery of the intracellular pH at each tested concentration of a substance was expressed as a percentage of the maximum recovery. Using the Sigma-Plot program, the IC50 value of the substance in<br><br>
question was calculated for the individual NHE subtypes using the percentages for pH recovery.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
