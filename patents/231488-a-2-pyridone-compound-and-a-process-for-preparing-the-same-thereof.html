				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel 2-pyridone compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and their use in therapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Elastases are possibly the most destructive enzymes in the body, having the ability to degrade virtually all connective tissue components. The uncontrolled proteolytic degradation by elastases has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions.<br>
Human neutrophil elastase (hNE), a member of the chymotrypsin superfamily of serine proteases is a 33-KDa enzyme stored in the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils. In neutrophils the concentration of NE exceeded 5 mM and its total cellular amount has been estimated to be up to 3 pg. Upon activation, NE is rapidly released from the granules into the extracellular space with some portion remaining bound to neutrophil plasma membrane (See Kawabat et al. 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 451,1-10). The main intracellular physiological function of NE is degradation of foreign organic molecules phagocytosed by neutrophils, whereas the main target for extracellular elastase is elastin (Janoff and Scherer, 1968, J. Exp. Med. 128,1137-1155). NE is unique, as compared to other proteases (for example, proteinase 3) in that it has the ability to degrade almost all extracellular matrix and key plasma proteins (See Kawabat et al. , 2002, Eur. .1. Pharmacol. 451,1-10). It degrades a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin, Type 3 and type 4 collagen, laminin, fibronectin, cytokines, etc. (Ohbayashi, 11.. 2002, Expert Opin.<br>
Investig. Drugs, 11,965-980). NE is a major common mediator of many pathological changes seen in chronic lung disease including epithelial damage (Stockley, R. A. 1994. Am. J. Resp. Grit. Care Med. 150,109-113).<br>
The destructive role of NE was solidified almost 40 years ago when Laurell and Eriksson reported an association of chronic airflow obstruction and emphysema with deficiency of<br><br>
serum ai-antitrypsin (Laurell and Eriksson, 1963, Scand J. Clin. Invest 15,132-140).<br>
Subsequently it was determined that cct-antitrypsin is the most important endogenous<br>
inhibitor of human NE. The imbalance between human NE and endogenous antiprotease is<br>
believed to cause excess human NE hi pulmonary tissues which is considered as a major<br>
pathogenic factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The excessive human<br>
NE shows a prominent destructive profile and actively takes part in destroying the normal<br>
pulmonary structures, followed by the irreversible enlargement of the respiratory airspaces,<br>
as seen mainly in emphysema. There is an increase in neutrophil recruitment into the lungs<br>
which is associated with increased lung elastase burden and emphysema in oci-proteinase<br>
inhibitor-deficient mice (Cavarra et al., 1996, Lab. Invest. 75,273-280). Individuals with<br>
higher levels of the NE-cti protease inhibitor complex in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid show<br>
significantly accelerated decline in lung functions compared to those with lower levels .<br>
(Betsuyaku et al. 2000, Respiration, 67,261*267). Instillation of human NE via the trachea<br>
in rats causes lung haemorrhage, neutrophil accumulation during acute phase and<br>
emphysematous changes during chronic phase (Karaki et al., 2002, Am. J. Resp. Grit Care<br>
Med., 166,496-500). Studies have shown that the acute phase of pulmonary emphysema<br>
and pulmonary haemorrhage caused by NE in hamsters can be inhibited by pre-treatment<br>
with inhibitors of NE (Fujie et al.,1999, brflamm. Res. 48,160-167).<br>
Neutrophil-predominant airway inflammation and mucus obstruction of the airways are<br>
major pathologic features of COPD, including cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis. NE<br>
impairs mucin production, leading to mucus obstruction of the airways. NE is reported to<br>
increase the expression of major respiratory mucin gene, MUC5AC (Fischer, B.M &amp;<br>
Voynow, 2002, Am. J. Respir. Cell Biol,, 26,447-452). Aerosol administration of NE to<br>
guinea pigs produces extensive epithelial damage within 20 minutes of contact (Suzuki et<br>
al, 1996, Am. J. Resp. Grit Care Med., 153,1405-1411). Furthermore NE reduces the<br>
ciliary beat frequency of human respiratory epithelium in vitro (Smallman et al., 1984,<br>
Thorax, 39,663-667) which is consistent with the reduced mucociliary clearance that is<br>
seen in COPD patients (Currie et al., 1984, Thorax, 42,126-130). The instillation of NE<br>
into the airways leads to mucus gland hyperplasia in hamsters (Lucey et al., 1985, Am.<br>
Resp. Crit. Care Med., 132,362-366). A role for NE is also implicated in mucus<br>
hypersecretion in asthma. In an allergen sensitised guinea pig acute asthma model an<br>
inhibitor of NE prevented goblet cell degranulation and mucus hypersecretion (Nadel et al.,<br>
1999, Eur. Resp. 3., 13,190-196).<br>
NE has been also shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
NE: oci.protenase inhibitor complex is increased in serum of patients with pulmonary<br>
fibrosis, which correlates with the clinical parameters in these patients (Yamanouchi et al.,<br>
1998, Eur. Resp. J. 11,120-125). In a murine model of human pulmonary fibrosis, a NE<br>
inhibitor reduced bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Taooka et al., 1997, Am. J. Resp.<br>
Grit. Care Med., 156,260-265). Furthermore investigators have shown that NE deficient<br>
mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (Dunsmore et al., 2001, Chest,<br>
120,35S-36S). Plasma NE level was found to be elevated in patients who progressed to<br>
ARDS implicating the importance of NE in early ARDS disease pathogenesis. (Donnelly<br>
et al., 1995, Am. J. Res. Crit. Care Med., 151,428-1433). The antiproteases and NE<br>
complexed with antiprotease are increased in lung cancer area (Marchandise et al., 1989,<br>
Eur. Resp. J. 2, 623-629). Recent studies have shown that polymorphism in the promoter<br>
region of the NE gene are associated with lung cancer development (Taniguchi et al., 2002,<br>
Clin. Cancer Res., 8,1115-1120.<br>
Acute lung injury caused by endotoxin in experimental animals is associated with elevated<br>
levels of NE (Kawabata, et al., 1999, Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care, 161,2013-2018). Acute<br>
lung inflammation caused by intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide in mice has been<br>
shown to elevate the NE activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid which is significantly<br>
inhibited by a NE inhibitor (Fujie et al., 1999, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 374,117-125; Yasui, et<br>
al., 1995, Eur. Resp. J., 8,1293-1299). NE also plays an important role in the neutrophilinduced<br>
increase of pulmonary microvascular permeability observed in a model of acute<br>
lung injury caused by tumour necrosis factor «. (TNFa) and phorbol myristate acetate<br>
(PMA) in isolated perfused rabbit lungs (Miyazaki et al., 1998, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care<br>
Med., 157, 89-94).<br>
A role for NE has also been suggested in monocrotoline-induced pulmonary vascular wall<br>
thickening and cardiac hypertrophy (Molteni et al., 1989, Biochemical Pharmacol. 38,<br>
2411-2419). Serine elastase inhibitor reverses the monocrotaline-induced pulmonary<br>
hypertension and remodelling in rat pulmonary arteries (Cowan et al., 2000, Nature<br>
Medicine, 6,698-702). Recent studies have shown that serine elastase, that is, NE or<br>
vascular elastase are important in cigarette smoke-induced muscularisation of small<br>
pulmonary arteries in guinea pigs (Wright et al., 2002, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 166,<br>
954-960).<br>
NE plays a key role in experimental cerebral ischemic damage (Shimakura et al., 2000,<br>
Brain Research, 858,55-60), ischemia-reperfusion lung injury (Kishima et al., 1998, Ann.<br>
Thorac. Surg. 65, 913-918) and myocardial ischemia in rat heart (Tiefenbacher et al., 1997,<br>
Eur. J. Physiol., 433, 563-570). Human NE levels in plasma are significantly increased<br>
above normal in inflammatory bowel diseases, for example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative<br>
colitis (Adeyemi et al., 1985, Gut, 26,1306-1311). In addition NE has also been assumed<br>
to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (Adeyemi et al., 1986,<br>
Rheumatol. Int., 6, 57). The development of collagen induced arthritis in mice is<br>
suppressed by a NE inhibitor (Kakimoto et al., 1995, Cellular Immunol. 165,26-32).<br>
Thus, human NE is known as one of the most destructive serine proteases and has been<br>
implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. The important endogenous inhibitor of<br>
human NE is cci-antitrypsin. The imbalance between human NE and antiprotease is<br>
believed to give rise to an excess of human NE resulting in uncontrolled tissue destruction.<br>
The protease/ antiprotease balance may be upset by a decreased availability of<br>
ocj-antitrypsin either through inactivation by oxidants such as cigarette smoke, or as a<br>
result of genetic inability to produce sufficient serum levels. Human NE has been<br>
implicated in the promotion or exacerbation of a number of diseases such as pulmonary<br>
emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ischemia<br>
reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary hypertension.<br>

receptor.<br>
The present invention discloses novel 2-pyridione derivatives that are inhibitors of human<br>
neutrophil elastase and homologous serine proteases such as proteinase 3 and pancreatic<br>
elastase, and are thereby useful in therapy.<br>

Salts of compounds of formula (I) may be formed by reacting the free base or a salt,<br>
enantiomer, tautomer or protected derivative thereof, with one or more equivalents of the<br>
appropriate acid. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent or medium in which the salt<br>
is insoluble, or in a solvent in which the salt is soluble followed by subsequent removal of<br>
the solvent in vacuo or by freeze drying. Suitable solvents include, for example, water,<br>
dioxane, ethanol, 2-propanol, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, or mixtures thereof. The<br>
reaction may be a metathetical process or it may be carried out on an ion exchange resin.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) and intermediate compounds thereto may be prepared as such or<br>
in protected form. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is, for example,<br>
described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J. W. F. McOmie,<br>
Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3rd edition, T. W.<br>
Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1999).<br>
The compounds of the invention and intermediates may be isolated from their reaction<br>
mixtures, and if necessary further purified, by using standard techniques.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric forms or<br>
mixtures thereof, all of which are included within the scope of the invention. The various<br>
optical isomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic mixture of the compounds using<br>
conventional techniques, for example, fractional crystallisation or HPLC. Alternatively, the<br>
individual enantiomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting<br>
materials under reaction conditions that will not cause racemisation.<br>
Intermediate compounds may also exist in enantiomeric forms and may be used as purified<br>
enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures thereof.<br>

According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, ate useful because<br>
they possess pharmacological activity in animals. The compounds of formula (I) have<br>
activity as pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators of human neutrophil elastase and<br>
homologous serine proteases such as proteinase 3 and pancreatic elastase, and as such are<br>
predicted to be useful in therapy. The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful as<br>
inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase. They may thus be used in the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of inflammatory diseases and conditions.<br>
Examples of these conditions are: adult respiratory distress syndrome CARDS), cystic<br>
fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and<br>
ischaemic-reperfusion injury. The compounds of this invention may also be useful in the<br>
modulation of endogenous and/or exogenous biological irritants which cause and/or<br>
propagate atherosclerosis, diabetes, myocardial infarction; hepatic disorders including but<br>
not limited to cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematous, inflammatory disease of lymphoid<br>
origin, including but not limited to T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, thymocytes;<br>
autoimmune diseases, bone marrow; inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout); inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially<br>
inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis and gastritis); inflammation of<br>
the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in<br>
disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as<br>
osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease);<br>
diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling<br>
associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), cornea! ulceration,<br>
ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal<br>
wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such<br>
as multiple sclerosis); age related illness such as dementia, inflammatory diseases of<br>
cardiovascular origins; granulomatous diseases; renal diseases including but not limited to<br>
nephritis and polyarteritis; cancer; pulmonary hypertension, ingested poisons, skin<br>
contacts, stings, bites; asthma; rhinitis; HTV disease progression; for minimising the effects<br>
-41<br>
of organ rejection in organ transplantation including but not limited to human organs; and<br>
replacement therapy of proteinase inhibitors.<br>
Thus, another aspect of the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions in which inhibition of neutrophil elastase<br>
activity is beneficial; and a method of treating, or reducing the risk of, diseases or<br>
conditions in which inhibition of neutrophil elastase activity is beneficial which comprises<br>
administering to a person suffering from or at risk of, said disease or condition, a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory diseases or conditions; and a method of treating,<br>
or reducing the risk of, inflammatory diseases or conditions which comprises administering<br>
to a person suffering from or at risk of, said disease or condition, a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In particular, the compounds of this invention may be used in the treatment of adult<br>
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, asthma, rhinitis,<br>
ischemia-reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis and<br>
gastric mucosal injury.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have<br>
suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the<br>
disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or<br>
condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or<br>
those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly<br>
susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
For the above mentioned therapeutic indications, the dose of the compound to be<br>
administered will depend on the compound employed, the disease being treated, the mode<br>
of administration, the age, weight and sex of the patient. Such factors may be determined<br>
by the attending physician. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the<br>
compounds are administered to a human at a daily dosage of between 0.1 mg/kg to 100<br>
mg/kg (measured as the active ingredient).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be used on their own, or in the form of appropriate<br>
pharmaceutical formulations comprising the compound of the invention in combination<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, adjuvant or carrier. Particularly preferred are<br>
compositions not containing material capable of causing an adverse reaction, for example,<br>
an allergic reaction. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable<br>
pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, "Pharmaceuticals - The Science<br>
of Dosage Form Designs", M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising<br>
preferably less than 95% by weight and more preferably less than 50% by weight of a<br>
compound of formula (I) hi admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or<br>
carrier.<br>
We also provide a method of preparation of such pharmaceutical formulations that<br>
comprises mixing the ingredients.<br>
The compounds may be administered topically, for example, to the lungs and/or the<br>
airways, in the form of solutions, suspensions, HFA aerosols or dry powder formulations,<br>
for example, formulations in the inhaler device known as the Turbuhaler®; or systemically,<br>
for example, by oral administration in the form of tablets, pills, capsules, syrups, powders<br>
or granules; or by parenteral administration, for example, in the form of sterile parenteral<br>
M'-l<br>
solutions or suspensions; or by rectal administration, for example, in the form of<br>
suppositories.<br>
Dry powder formulations and pressurized HFA aerosols of the compounds of the invention<br>
may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation. For inhalation, the compound is desirably<br>
finely divided. The finely divided compound preferably has a mass median diameter of less<br>
than 10 pan, and may be suspended in a propellent mixture with the assistance of a<br>
dispersant, such as a Cg-Cao fatty acid or salt thereof, (for example, oleic acid), a bile salt, a<br>
phospholipid, an alkyl saccharide, aperfluorinated or polyethoxylated surfactant, or other<br>
phannaceutically acceptable dispersant<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered by means of a dry powder<br>
inhaler. The inhaler may be a single or a multi dose inhaler, and may be a breath actuated<br>
dry powder inhaler.<br>
One possibility is to mix the finely divided compound with a carrier substance, for<br>
example, a mono-, di- or polysaccharide, a sugar alcohol, or an other poiyol. Suitable<br>
carriers are sugars, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol,<br>
trehalose, sucrose, mannitol; and starch. Alternatively the finely divided compound may be<br>
coated by another substance. The powder mixture may also be dispensed into hard gelatine<br>
capsules, each containing the desired dose of the active compound.<br>
Another possibility is to process the finely divided powder into spheres which break up<br>
during the inhalation procedure. This spheronized powder may be filled into the drug<br>
reservoir of a multidose inhaler, for example, that known as the Turbuhaler® in which a<br>
dosing unit meters the desired dose which is then inhaled by the patient. With this system<br>
the active compound, with or without a carrier substance, is delivered to the patient<br>
For oral administration the active compound may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier,<br>
for example, lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol; a starch, for example, potato starch,<br>
corn starch or amylopectin; a cellulose derivative; a binder, for example, gelatine or<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; and/or a lubricant, for example, magnesium stearate, calcium<br>
stearate, polyethylene glycol, a wax, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into<br>
tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be<br>
coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain, for example, gum arabic,<br>
gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated<br>
with a suitable polymer dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent.<br>
For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the compound may be admixed with, for<br>
example, a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain<br>
granules of the compound using either the above mentioned excipients for tablets. Also<br>
liquid or semisolid formulations of the drug may be filled into hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for<br>
example, solutions containing the compound, the balance being sugar and a mixture of<br>
ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may<br>
contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, sacchanne and/or carboxymethylcellulose as a<br>
thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in art.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with other<br>
compounds used for the treatment of the above conditions.<br>
The following Examples are intended to illustrate, but in no way limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
