Material feed container for a thick-matter pump Specification<br>
The invention relates to a material feed container for a thick-matter pump, in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, or in accordance with the preamble of claim 20, or in accordance with the preamble of claim 30, respectively.<br>
A material feed container for thick-matter pumps is known from EP 1 076 596 Bl, which has a lower container part that is open towards the top, and a container top releasably. connected with the former by way of a flange connection. The circumferential upper edge of the container top delimits the material feed opening. A stirrer mechanism is mounted in the lower container part; its mountings are situated in a recess of the lower container part open at the edge, so that the stirrer mechanism can be easily interchanged after the container top has been removed. The container top forms, a filling funnel for thick matter, such as concrete. Filling-in of the concrete generally takes place in that a mixer truck drives up to the material feed container and fills the concrete into the material feed container by way of a chute. In order to avoid damage to the .container top due to a collision with the mixer truck that drives up, the container top must consist of stable sheet metal. CThis requires<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
2<br>
a great weight, so that the container top cannot simply be removed by hand.<br>
Material feed containers according to EP 1 076 596' Bl have intermediate rings as wear parts in the feed cylinder openin-gs, which rings protect the inner surface of the feed cylinder opening, which is part of the container face wall, against wear due to concrete flowing through. Because of wear, these intermediate rings must be replaced regularly. Since the intermediate rings are inserted into the feed cylinder opening from the feed cylinder side, the feed cylinder must first be removed from the container face wall, for assembly and disassembly. CThis is complicated.<br>
It is the task of the invention to further develop a material feed container of the type stated initially, in such a manner that it is easier to maintain and that wear parts can be replaced more simply.<br>
This task is accomplished by means of a material feed container having the characteristics of claim 1, alternatively having the characteristics of claim 20, or alternatively having the characteristics Cof Cclaim C30, C respectively. C C Advantageous<br><br>

embodiments of the invention are . the object of the dependent claims.<br>
The invention faccording to clalim 1 lis based on the idea of making the interior l| of the material S'feed container more easily accessible to (maintenance personnel, in that it has a container tojp that can '(easily be detached a'nd removed, on the face wall si|de. However, the container topi does not extend to the rear walll, which faces the mixer truck that drives up. Thus, the cilrcumferentiall edge that delimits 'the material feed opening has an) edge part |that belongs to the 'lower container part, on the rear wall side. The container top is thereby protected against damage caused by the mixer truck. It therefore does not have to bel structured 'to be as stable as the lower container part, and can have a relatively low weight.<br>
It' is advantageous if the first edge part situated on the container top 'aligns with the' second edge part that belongs to the lower container part. The1 material feed opening can then be covered, in simple manner, by means of a hinged lid that is articulated onto the container) top,, at the upper face wall part. The hinged lid is preferably imade of plastic, so that concrete residue adheres less well to it than to a metal lid. The hinged lid is therefore easier to clean.<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
4<br>
It is practical if the lower container part has a rear wall, a floor, a lower face wall part, and lower side wall parts that drop towards the lower face wall part. It is advantageous if the upper face wall part and the upper side wall parts of the container top bear a first Cflange on their lower edge, which flange is releasably connected with a complementary second flange on the lower face wall part 'and on the lower side wall parts of the lower container part. It is practical if a sealin-g means is disposed between the first flange and the second flange. This results in a good sealing effect at the parting line between lower container part and container top.<br>
It is" practical if the lower' face wall part, the rear wall, the lower side wall parts of the lower container part and/or the floor consist of sheet metal preferably of stable steel sheet. An advantageous alternative consists in having the lower face<br>
wall part, the rear wall, the lower side wall parts and/or the<br>
1 floor Cconsist Cat Cleast Cpartially Cof Ca Clight_ construction<br>
material. C The light construction material can have a carbon-<br>
fiber-reinforced plastic and/pr a fiberglass-reinforced plastic. It is also possible that the light construction material is<br>
silicon Ccarbide Cor Ca Cmetal Cfoam, Cpreferably Cwith Ctitanium<br>
components. C It is practical if the light construction material<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
5 carries C a C friction-wear-resistant C and/or C hard C coating,<br><br>
particularly from the material<br><br>
group of chrome, silicon carbide,<br><br>
or ceramic. The feed cylinder openings are preferably disposed in the lower face wall part. Furthermore, a support device for<br>
the tube switch is preferably mounted in the lower container<br>
part. CFurthermore, it is practical if the lower container part<br>
has pivot bearings for a stirrer mechanism. In this way, the forces transferred by the feed cylinders, the tube switch, and the stirrer mechanism during pump operation, which can be considerable, Care absorbed by the lower container part. C The<br><br>
container top, which merely has<br><br>
to absorb the forces that result<br><br>
from filling-in of the thick matter, can therefore be configured to be significantly less stable and therefore lighter.<br>
The upper face wall part and the upper side wall parts of the<br>
container top can also consist of sheet metal, preferably of<br>
steel sheet. CIn this connection, lower wall thickness values are<br><br>
possible than Cin the case of<br><br>
the sheet metal of the lower<br><br>
container part. C However, it is preferred that the upper face<br>
wal1 part and the upper side wall parts consist of plastic. CIt<br>
is advantageous if the container top is produced in one piece, as<br><br>
an injection-molded part. CIt is practical if a contact bead for<br>
a lattice grid is molded onto this injection-molded part, facing<br><br>
the container interior. C Likewise, reinforcement strips can be<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
6<br>
molded onto the upper face wall part and/or the upper side wall parts, which strips impart greater stability to the container top.<br>
Alternatively Cor Csupplementally, Cthe Ccontainer Ctop, Cin Cthis<br>
connection particularly the- face wall part and/or the upper side<br>
wall parts, can consist at least partially of a light construction material. In practical manner, the light construction material used for this purpose can have a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic and/or a fiberglass-reinforced plastic. It is also possible that the1! light construction material is<br>
i<br>
silicon carbide or a metal foam, which preferably has titanium components. CIt is practical if the light construction material<br>
bears a friction-wear-resistant land/or hard coating, particularly<br>
1 from the material group of chrome, silicon carbide, or ceramic.<br>
Alternatively Cor Cadditionally Cto Cthe Ccontact Cbead Con Cthe<br>
container top, the lower container part can have contact elements<br>
for a lattice grid that project beyond the lower face wall part.<br><br>
This is particularly advantageous if the lattice grid is very heavy and its weight cannot be borne by the container top. It is practical if the second, rear wall side edge part of the material feed opening is formed by a rubber apron affixed to the lower<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
container part. CThe latter follows the rear wall and segments of the side walls that proceed from the rear wall.<br>
It is preferred that the lower container part and the container<br>
top are connected with one another by means of screws. C This<br><br>
results in a simple, stable, and nevertheless easily releasable<br>
connection.<br>
The solution according to the invention according to claim 29 is based on the idea that a hinged lid, which covers the material feed opening, is articulated onto a container wall, and is made of plastic or a light construction material, is easier to clean than a conventional hinged lid made of sheet metal. Thick matter, particularly concrete, adheres to plastic significantly<br><br>
more poorly than to sheet metal<br><br>
It is practical if the hinged<br><br>
lid is configured as a hollow plastic body having a first plastic shell that faces the material feed opening, and a second plastic shell, preferably connected in one piece with the former, forming an upper lid part. CA hollow plastic body is relatively stable,<br>
while having low weight. C This is particularly advantageous if<br><br>
the hinged lid is articulated onto the container top and must be removed together with the container top for maintenance work in<br>
the container interior.<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2O04/O14412<br>
8<br>
In order to facilitate cleaning, the first plastic shell can have<br>
a smooth surface that faces the material feed opening. C In<br>
i<br>
contrast, it is preferred Cthat the second plastic shell has reinforcement beads. This Cimparts increased stability to the hinged lid. It is advantageous if the hinged lid is produced in one piece, using a rotation casting method.<br>
If the hinged lid consists at least partially of a light construction material, it is practical if the lid has a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic and/;or a fiberglass-reinforced plastic.<br>
The light construction material can also be silicon carbide, or a<br>
1! metal Cfoam that preferably has titanium components. C It is<br><br>
practical if the light construction material bears a friction-<br>
wear-resistant Cand/or Chard Ccoating, Cparticularly Cfrom Cthe<br>
material group of chrome, silicon carbide, or ceramic.<br>
It Cis Cpractical Cif Cthe Chinged lid has Chandles, Cwhich Care<br>
preferably molded on in one piece. CFurthermore, it is practical<br>
if it has hooks into -which Cclosure elements attached to a container wall can be hooked. Also, it is preferable if the hooks are molded onto the hinged lid in one piece. The hinged lid is preferably connected with the container face wall by means of at least one hinge and at least one gas spring. The gas spring Cfacilitates Copening of Cthe Clid.

connected with the- container face wall, it is practical if the<br>
hinged lid has attachment means for a rubber apron on the first<br>
plastic shell. CThis apron hangs down from the hinged lid into<br>
the material feed opening and prevents thick matter from flowing<br>
i into the gap between the hinged lid and the container face wall.<br>
The solution according to the invention according to claim 4 4 is<br>
based on the idea that it requires less effort to mount and<br><br>
detach the intermediate rings by way of the container interior<br>
than by way of the container exterior. C In this way, Cit is<br>
avoided that the feed cylinders have to be uncoupled from the<br>

intermediate rings. C An intermediate ring is inserted into the<br>
feed cylinder opening by way of the container. interior, in that<br>
the toe is pushed into the bayonet opening on its outer mantle<br>
surface, and the intermediate ring is subsequently rotated about<br>
its longitudinal axis, so that,, the toe is introduced into the<br>
inner groove. C Mounting of an intermediate ring by way of the<br>
container interior is particularly advantageous if the material<br><br>
feed container is configured in two parts, as described above.<br>
The container interior is easily accessible by removing the<br>
relatively light container top.<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2OO4/014412<br>
10<br>
The inner groove can be configured to be circumferential in the<br><br>
feed cylinder opening. CPreferably, the intermediate ring has at<br><br>
least two, preferably three toes, disposed at an equal angle distance from one another, on its outer mantle surface. The feed cylinder opening then has a Cnumber of bayonet openings that corresponds to the number of toes, which are also disposed at the<br>
same angle distance from one another. C Since the intermediate<br>
ring is fixed in place, in the axial direction, by means of the<br><br>
engagement of the toes in the inner groove, this fixation is all<br>
the more stable, the more toes are disposed on the outer mantle<br>
surface.<br>
It is practical if a connector plate for connecting feed cylinders is affixed to the container outside on the container face wall, through which plate the feed cylinder openings extend. Furthermore, it is practical Cif a spectacle plate having two spectacle plate openings is attached to the inner surface of the container face wall. The spectacle plate openings communicate with the feed cylinder openings., and their delimitation surfaces align with the delimitation surfaces of the flow-through-channels<br>
in the intermediate rings. CThe spectacle plate therefore covers<br><br>
part of the feed cylinder openings and additionally fixes the<br>
intermediate Crings Cin Cplace Cin Cthe Cdirection Ctowards Cthe<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2004/014412<br>
11<br>
container interior. The spectacle plate is removed for replacement of the intermediate rings.<br>
It is practical if the intermediate ring and/or the spectacle plate consist at least partially of a friction-wear-resistant light construction material. The light construction material can have a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic and/or a fiberglass-reinforced plastic. It is Calso possible that the light construction material is silicontcarbide or a metal foam, whereby the latter preferably has titanium components.<br>
It is practical if the delimitation surfaces of the flow-through-channels and/or the spectacle pate openings are coated with a friction-wear-resistant layer. (The latter preferably consists of a hard metal or of a material from the material group of chrome, silicon carbide, or "ceramic. The spectacle plate and the intermediate rings, which are wear parts, in each instance, are protected against friction wear by the friction-wear-resistant layer, and therefore need to be replaced less frequently.<br>
It can be provided that the diameter of the flow-through-channel harrows towards the container interior or towards the feed cylinder. In this way, feed cylinders having different inside diameters can be connected with the material feed container, in<br><br>
WO 2005/095797	PCT/EP2O04/014412<br>
12<br>
that different intermediate rings are inserted into the feed cylinder openings. It is practical if the flbw-through-channels are dimensioned in such a manner that their delimitation surfaces align with the inner surfaces of the feed cylinders.<br>
It is advantageous if the intermediate ring has at least one circumferential groove, offset axially relative to the toes, in its mantle surface, with a sealing ring for contact against the container face wall and/or the, connector plate. Preferably, it has two circumferential grooves, one- of which accommodates a sealing ring that lies against the container face wall, the other of which accommodates a sealing ring that lies against the connector plate. The intermediate ring can have another circumferential groove on a face facing the spectacle plate, having a sealing ring that lies against the spectacle plate. By means of these measures, one achieves a good seal of the material feed container in the region of the feed cylinder openings.<br>
To facilitate assembly and disassembly, the intermediate ring can have recesses for the insertion of holder mandrels on a face that faces the spectacle plate. Furthermore, a circumferential cavity can be disposed between the intermediate ring and the container face wall,- which cavity can be tilled with lubricant by way of a feed opening, and increases in size when the intermediate ring is<br><br>

steel sheet having a thick wall. C-Only forces that proceed from<br>
the concrete filled into the material feed opening 64 act on the<br>
container top 40. C Therefore, significantly lower requirements<br>
are set for its stability.<br>
The lower container part 38 has pipe shaped contact elements 74<br>

56 C CAlternatively, the lattice grid can also be laid onto a<br>
contact bead that faces the container interior, which is molded<br><br>
onto the container top 40. C The material feed container 20 is<br>
 C C C C	<br>
attached to the; chassis 10 by way of suspension devices 76.<br>
On the container outside, a connector plate 80 for connecting the<br>
'	<br>
feed cylinders 26 is affixed to the face wall 22. COn the inside<br>
of the face wall 22, a spectacle plate 82 is releasably attached<br><br>
(Fig. 4), the spectacle plate openings 84 of which communicate<br>
with the feed cylinder openings 24. C The spectacle plate 82<br>

container interior. The intermediate ring 86 extends, in the axial direction, beyond the feed cylinder opening 24 that extends through,the face wall 22 and the connector plate 80. Its inner surface (delimits a flow-tihrough-channel 88 for the thick matter.<br>
The outer mantle surfacfe 90 of the intermediate rinq 86 bears<br>
three toes 92 disposed at an angle distance of 120°. CThese can<br>
be introduced into an inner groove 94 that runs circumferentially<br><br>
in the feed cylinder opening 24, by way of bayonet openings 95,<br><br>
and Cthus, form Ca Cbayonet Cclosure Cby Cmeans Cof Cwhich Cthe<br>
intermediate ring 86 can be fixed in place in the feed cylinder<br><br>
opening 24, in the axial direction towards the feed cylinder 26.<br>
The delimitation surface of the flow-through-channel 88 aligns<br>
with the delimitation surface of the spectacle plate openings 84<br><br>
as well as with the inner surfaces of the feed cylinders 26. CAs<br><br>
a result, there are no exposed edges in the feed cylinder opening<br><br>
24, which vtauld be exposed Cto increased friction wear due to<br>
thick matter flowing by. C For a further reduction in friction<br><br>
wear, both the spectacle plate 82 and the delimitation surface of<br><br>
the flow-through-channel 88 Thave a friction-wear-resistant layer<br>

89 of hard metal. C To seal the feed cylinder opening 24, the<br><br>
intermediate 'ring 86 has two circumferential grooves 96 in its<br><br>

unscrewed.<br><br>
Subsequently, the intermediate ring 86 is rotated<br><br><br>
abbut its longitudinal axis until the toes 92 can be pulled out<br><br>
of the bayonet openings 95. CFor this purpose, the intermediate ring has recesbes 100 on its face surface, for inserting holder<br><br>
