( See Section 10; rule 13 )<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of liquid detergent compositions, in particular to coloured, highly concentrated liquid detergent compositions.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In general dyes used to colour liquid detergent compositions are water soluble and can be used without difficulty in standard aqueous liquid detergent compositions. Instead of a water-soluble dye, a pigment may be used to colour the liquid detergent composition. Many pigments are known in the art and it is not difficult to obtain the right colour and the right intensity. Pigments have been suggested in EP-A-344909 as an ingredient for non-aqueous liquid compositions. US-A-5759981 describes a non¬aqueous bleaching liquid wherein the bleaching system contains a bleach catalyst (manganese phthalocyanine) and a perborate bleach. However, the incorporation of pigments in such a highly concentrated liquid detergent is still problematic. Liquid detergent compositions comprising pigments are difficult to stabilise because the pigments tend to flocculate over time making the product commercially unacceptable. Liquid detergent compositions may be sold in clear containers such as water-soluble films, but many pigments are not colour stable in such containers. Furthermore, pigments in such concentrated liquid detergents may cause spotting on laundry items.<br>
WO-A-99/00477 discloses nonaqueous liquid detergent compositions containing 400-1,500 micron speckles which contains conventional dyes or pigments.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that one or more of these problems can be solved by the present invention. The present invention provides a concentrated liquid detergent composition comprising<br><br>
1-90 % of a nonionic surfactant, 1-60 % of an organic solvent, and 0.0001 - 2 % of a pigment<br>
wherein more than 90% of the pigment particles have a particle size of less than 50 micron, preferably less than 30 micron, more preferably less than 10 micron, most preferably less than 1 micron. The pigment is dispersed in the composition in the form of particles of these specified sizes.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention.relates to a process for preparing.a-concentrated liquid detergent composition comprising nonionic surfactant, an organic solvent and pigment, said process comprising the steps of<br>
-	mixing the nonionic surfactant with the organic solvent,<br>
-	adding to this mixture the pigment in the form of a pigment premix, and<br>
-	adding remaining ingredients.<br>
Accordingly, the advantages of the inventive composition are that the composition, does not cause visible pigment spotting on the laundered clothing, the coloured liquid detergent compositions are colour stable in transparent containers and/or that the composition is stable, i.e. the pigments remain homogeneously dispersed in the liquid detergent composition after at least 6 wks storage at 37°C.<br>
Neither EP-A-344909 nor US-A-5759981 describes the above mentioned problems or suggests that the selection of this particle size distribution of the pigments would have these advantages.<br>
Detailed desription of the invention<br>
Pigment<br>
Pigments are particulate finely divided solids. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that pigments are usually insoluble in the liquid detergent composition. On the other hand dyes are thought to be soluble or go into solution in the liquid detergent composition. For the purpose of this invention, pigments include those compounds such as indanthrone (Pigment Blue) which can both behave as a dye or a pigment<br><br>
depending on whether it is in a reduced or oxidised state. Pigments alter appearance either by selective absorption and/or scattering of light. In general, any pigment class compatible with the other ingredients of the liquid detergent composition may be used. A preferred group of pigments includes the coloured, white organic and inorganic pigments. Preferred examples of white inorganic pigments are titanium oxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, lithophone and lead whites. Preferred examples of coloured inorganic pigments are iron oxide pigments, mixed-metal oxides (spinels, rutiles and zircon pigments, pigments based on bismuth vanadate, chromium (III), ultramarine, cyanide iron blues, cadmium, and lead chromate. Organic pigment is preferably selected from the group including azo pigments, BON reds .and. maroons,, lakes,, phthalocyanines, quinacridones, diaryl pyrrolopyrroles, VAT dye pigments, aminoanthraquinone, dioxazine, isoinolinones, isoindolines quinophthalones and mixtures thereof. Examples pigments are the Pigmosol™ range produced by BASF. It is referred that the pigment has a non-white colour, preferably a blue, green or blue-green colour.<br>
One especially preferred class of pigment includes phthalocyanine and water-soluble and water-dispersible derivatives thereof.<br>
One form of substitution possible for the present invention is substitution of the central metal by iron, manganese, cobalt, chromium, rhodium, ruthenium, Molybdenum or other transition metals.<br>
A preferred phthalocyanine is selected from the group including copper phthalocyanine, cobalt phthalocyanine, derivatives thereof'and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred are copper phthalocyanine blue and copper phthalocyanine green and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples phthalocyanine pigments are sold under the trade names Hostafine Blue B2G, Colanyl Blue A2R, Colanyl Green GG 130 (ex Clariant UK).<br>
However, it is essential that at least 90% of the pigment particles have a particle size of less than 50 micron, preferably less than 30 micron, even more preferably less than 10 micron, most preferably less than 1.0 micron. Preferably at least 90% of the<br><br>
pigment particles are larger than 0.001, more preferably larger than 0.005, most preferably larger than 0.01 micron<br>
To improve the stability of the pigment particles in the liquid detergent composition according the invention even further it is preferred that at least 50 % of the pigment particles have a particle size of less than 10 micron, preferably less than 1 micron, even more preferably less than 0.60 micron, most preferably less than 0.50 micron. Preferably, at least 50 % of particles have a particle size of more than 0.01, more preferably more than 0.1 most preferably more than 0.30 micron.<br>
Preferably, the liquid detergent composition herein comprise at least 0.0001, more preferably 0.001 most preferably, 0.005% pigment and less than 2.0% more preferably, less 1.5% most preferably less than 1.0%<br>
The desired particle size distribution may be obtained by process known in the art such as milling and sieving. Preferably, the pigment in mixed with an organic solvent such as monopropylene glycol in a bead mill and sieved to obtain the desired particle size distribution.<br>
The particle size may be measured with commercially available means such as the HELOS™ system produced by Sympatec GmbH (Germany) which uses a Laser Diffraction sensor. In this system, particles cause a diffraction of the laser light in the spectrum which is converted into an image that can be detected by a photo detector, that converts the intensity of the light into electrical signals, which will be processed by computational means using the software provided. The computer programme converts the data into particle size distribution and the cumulative particle size.<br>
Liquid detergent composition<br>

Organic Solvent<br>
Another component of the liquid detergent composition herein comprises non¬aqueous, low-polarity organic solvent(s).

While some of the essential and/or optional components of the compositions herein<br><br><br>
may actually dissolve in the "solvent"-containing phase, other components will be present as particulate material dispersed within the "solvent" -containing phase. Thus the term "solvent" is not meant to require that the solvent material be capable of actually dissolving all of the detergent composition components added thereto.<br>
The non-aqueous organic materials which are employed as solvents herein are those which are liquids of low polarity.

Inorganic peroxygen bleaching agents may also be used in particulate form in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
Inorganic bleaching agents are in fact preferred. Such inorganic peroxygen compounds include alkali metal perborate and percarbonate materials, most preferably the percarbonates. For example, sodium perborate (e.g. mono- or tetra-hydrate) can be used. Suitable inorganic bleaching agents can also include sodium or potassium carbonate peroxy hydrate and equivalent "percarbonate" bleaches, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Persulfate bleach (e.g., OXONE, manufactured commercially by DuPont) can also be used. Frequently inorganic peroxygen bleaches will be coated with silicate, borate, sulfate or water-soluble surfactants. For example, coated percarbonate particles are available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay Interox, Tokai Denka and Degussa.<br>
Inorganic percxygen bleaching agents, e.g., the perborates, the percarbonates, etc., are preferably combined with bleach activators, which lead to the in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during use of the compositioris herein for fabric laundering/bleaching) of the peroxy acid corresponding to the bleach activator. Various non-limiting examples of activators are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,915,854, Issued April 10, 1990 to Mao et al.; and U.S. Patent 4,412,934 Issued November 1, 1983 to Chung et al.

If peroxygen bleaching agents are used as all or part of the essentially present particulate material, they will generally comprise from about 1% to 30% by weight of the composition. More preferably, peroxygen bleaching agent will comprise from about 1% to 20% by weight of the composition. Most preferably, peroxygen bleaching agent will be present to the extent of from about 3% to 15% by weight of the composition. If utilised, bleach activators can comprise from about 0.5% to 20%, more preferably from about 1% to 10%, by weight of the composition. Frequently, activators are employed such that the molar ratio of bleaching agent to activator ranges from about 1:1 to 10:1, more preferably from about 1.5:1 to 5:1.<br>
In addition, it has been found that bleach activators, when agglomerated with certain acids such as citric acid, are more chemically stable.<br>
Thickening, Viscosity Control and/or Dispersing Agents<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain a polymeric material which serves to enhance the ability of the composition to maintain its solid particulate components in suspension. Such materials may thus act as thickeners, viscosity control agents and/or dispersing agents. Such materials are frequently polymeric poiycarboxylates but can include other polymeric materials such as<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polymeric amine derivatives such as quaternized, ethoxylated hexamethylene diamines.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerising or copolymerising suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerised to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein of monomeric segments, containing.no.carboxylate radicals-such, as vinylmethyl ether,styrene, ethylene,etc is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight of the polymer.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerised acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000, and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued March 7, 1967. Such materials may also perform a builder function.<br>
If utilised, the optional thickening, viscosity control and/or dispersing agents should be present in the compositions herein to the extent of from about 0.1% to 4% by weight. More preferably, such materials can comprise from about 0.5% to 2% by weight of the detergents compositions herein.<br>
Minors<br>
The detergent compositions herein preferably at least one minor component selected from the group including conventional brighteners, suds suppressors, silicone oils, bleach catalysts, (terephtalate-based) soil release polymers, anti-dye transfer agents, anti-wrinkling polymers, enzymes and/or perfume materials. The enzyme is preferably<br><br>
selected from the group including protease, cellulase, lipase, amylase, other enzymes suitable for the cleaning of laundry.<br>
Such minor components must, of course, be compatible and non-reactive with the other composition components. If present, brighteners suds suppressors and/or perfumes will typically comprise from about 0.01% to 2% by weight of the compositions herein.<br>
Encapsulates<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the liquid detergent compositions of the invention is encapsulated in a water soluble film. Preferably, the water-soluble film comprises polyvinylalcohol (PVOH), in particular more than 50 wt% polyvinylalcohol and preferably also one or more carboxy-functional monomers. If the liquid detergent composition is to be encapsulated in a water-soluble film it is preferred that the composition does not comprise solid builders or solid bleaches other than the pigment. In addition, it is preferable that the liquid detergent composition can be stabily encapsulated in water-soluble film, i.e., the thus encapsulated composition and film should be stable for at least 4 wks at 37°C: the film should not break or become brittle.<br>
PVOH can be made by the polymerisation of vinyl acetate, followed by hydrolysis, conveniently by reaction with sodium hydroxide. However, the resulting film has a highly symmetrical, hydrogen-bonded structure and is not readily soluble in cold water. PVOH films which are suitable for the formation of water soluble packages are typically polymers produced from copolymerisation of vinyl acetate and another comonomer which contains a carboxylic function. Examples of such comonomers include monocarboxylates, such as acrylic acid, and dicarboxylates, such as itaconic acid, which may be present during polymerisation as esters. Alternatively, the anhydride of maleic acid may be used as the copolymer. The inclusion of the comonomer reduces the symmetry of and degree of hydrogen bonding in the final film and renders the film soluble even in cold water.<br>
However, when the resultant copolymer film contains carboxylic acid or carboxylate groups (either of these hereinafter being referred to as "carboxylate functionality") in proximity to hydroxyl groups on the same carbon chain and there is an attendant drive<br><br>
towards cyclisation of these groups by water elimination to form lactones. A low levei of lactone formation is desirable to improve the mechanical properties of the film. However, the formation of excessive amounts of lactones is undesirable as this tends to reduce the cold water solubility of the film, giving rise to a danger of undissolved film residues when the package is used.<br>
The problem of excessive lactone formation is particularly acute when the liquid composition inside the package comprises ionic species. This is thought to be because the presence of ionic species can give rise to exchange between sodium ions (associated.with carboxylate. groups), in.the film andhydrogen ions.in. the. liquid composition. Once such exchange has occurred, the resulting carboxylic acid group in the film can cyclise with a neighbouring hydroxyl group, eliminating water in the process, thus forming lactones.<br>
This problem is avoided by providing in the composition, a molar excess (with respect to the amount of exchangeable hydrogen ions in the at least one ionic ingredient) of a stabilising compound effective for combining with the exchangeable hydrogen ions to hinder the formation of lactones, especially (3 lactones within the film; with the proviso that if the stabilising compound is or comprises an inorganic base and/or ammonium hydroxide then it is present in an amount of at least 95 mole % of the amount to completely neutralise the at least one ionic ingredient.<br>
The Stabilising Compound<br>
The provision of a molar excess (with respect'to the amount of exchangeable hydrogen ions in the at least one ionic ingredient) of the stabilising compound in the liquid composition is found to have a significant effect in maintaining the cold water solubility of the film through the hindrance of lactone formation. However, in the case of inorganic bases and/or ammonium hydroxide forming all or part of the stabilising compound, the amount of stabilising compound need not be in excess, provided it is at least 95 mole % of the amount needed for full neutralisation. Surprisingly, the hindrance of lactone formation is significantly greater when these amounts of stabilising compound is used than when a molar equivalent or less is used. This advantageous effect is particularly marked after prolonged storage (eg for several weeks) of the package according to the invention at elevated temperature (eg 37°C),<br><br><br>
conditions which are frequently encountered by some commercial products in European and other markets.<br>
. The problem of excessive lactone formation is particularly acute when the liquid composition inside the package comprises ionic species having an exchangeable hydrogen ion, for example fatty acids or the acid precursors of anionic surfactants.<br>
This problem may be solved by including in the composition, a stabilising compound effective for combining with the exchangeable hydrogen ions to hinder the formation of lactones within the film. This stabilising compound should preferably be in-molar excess relative to the component(s) having an exchangeable ion.   This molar excess is preferably up to 105 mole %, preferably up to 110 mole % of the stoichiometric amount necessary for complete neutralisation.   It is preferably an organic base such as one or more amines, e.g. monoethanolamine, triethanolamine and mixtures thereof. When the stabilising compound is or comprises an inorganic base such as an alkali metal (e.g. sodium or potassium) hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide, it may, however, present in an amount as low as 95 mole %, eg. from 95 mole % to 105 mole % relative to the component(s) having an exchangeable hydrogen ion.<br>
Other possible inorganic stabilising compounds are alkaline earth metal hydroxides or other inorganic bases which do liberate water on protonation. These are preferably also used in an amount indicated above for the alkali metal hydroxides and ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Yet other suitable'stabilising compounds are amines other than monoethanolamine and triethanolamine, and organic Lewis bases or other organic or inorganic bases provided .that they will interact effectively with labile protons within the detergent composition to hinder the production of lactones in the film.<br>
The Ionic Ingredient with Exchangeable Hydrogen Ions<br>
When present, the ionic ingredient with exchangeable hydrogen ions may, for example, constitute from between 1% and 40% (prior to any neutralisation) by weight of the total substantially non-aqueous liquid composition. When used primarily for their surfactant properties, such ingredients may for example be present in amounts<br><br>
greater than 10% by weight. When used as deflocculants (see below), the amounts may be 10% by weight or less, e.g. no more than 5% by weight. These ingredients may for example be selected from anionic surfactant acid precursors and fatty acids and mixtures thereof.<br>
Anionic surfactant acids are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples suitable for use in a liquid composition according to the invention include alkylbenzene sulphonic acid, particularly C8-15linearalkylbenzene sulphonic acids and mixtures thereof.   Other suitable surfactant acids include the acid forms of olefin sulphonates, alkyl ether sulphates, alkyl. sulphates, or.alkana sulphonates and mixtures.thereof,<br>
A wide range of fatty acids are suitable for inclusion in a liquid composition according to the invention, for example selected from one or moreC1-15 alkyl allkenyl monocarboxylic acids. Saturated or unsaturated fatty acids may be used. Examples of suitable fatty acids include oleic acid, lauric acid or hardened tallow fatty acid.<br>
The Water Soluble Package<br>
Any reference herein to filling refers to complete filling and also partial filling whereby some air or other gas is also trapped in the sealed envelope.<br>
The envelope forming the package is preferably formed by horizontal or vertical form-film-seal technique.<br>
(a)       The Copolymer Film<br>
A preferred plastics film is a polyvinyl alcohol film, especially one made of a polyvinyl alcohol copolymer having a comonomer having a carboxylate function.<br>
PVOH can be made by the polymerisation of vinyl acetate, followed by hydrolysis, conveniently by reaction with sodium hydroxide. However, the resulting film has a highly symmetrical, hydrogen-bonded structure and is not readily soluble in cold water. PVOH films which are suitable for the formation of water soluble packages are typically polymers produced from copolymerisation of vinyl acetate and another comonomer which contains a carboxylic function. Examples of such comonomers<br><br>
include monocarboxylates, such as acrylic acid, and dicarboxylates, such as itaconic acid, which may be present during polymerisation as esters. Alternatively, the anhydride of maleic acid may be used as the copolymer. The inclusion of the comonomer reduces the symmetry of and degree of hydrogen bonding in the final film and renders the film soluble even in cold water.<br>
Suitable PVOH films for use in a package according to the invention are commercially available and described, for example, in EP-B-0291198. PVOH films for use in a package according to the invention can be made by the copolymerisation of vinyl acetate and a carboxylate-containing monomer (for example acrylic, maleic or itaconic acid or acid ester), followed by partial (for example up to about 90%) hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide.<br>
(b)       Horizontal form-fill-seal<br>
Water soluble PVOH packages of the invention can be made according to any of the methods horizontal form-fill-seal described in any of WO-A-00/55044, WO-A-00/55045, WO-A-00/55046, WO-A-00/55068, WO-A-OO/55069 and WO-A-00/55415.<br>
By way of example, a thermoforming process is now described where a number of packages according to the invention are produced from two sheets of water soluble material. In this regard recesses are formed in the film sheet using a forming die having a plurality of cavities with dimensions corresponding generally to the dimensions of the packages to be produced. Further, a single heating plate is used for thermoformtng the film for all the cavities, and in the same way a single sealing plate is described.<br>
A first sheet of polyvinyl alcohol film is drawn over a forming die so that the film is placed over the plurality of forming cavities in the die. In this example each cavity is generally dome shape having a round edge, the edges of the cavities further being radiussed to remove any sharp edges which might damage the film during the forming or sealing steps of the process. Each cavity further includes a raised surrounding flange. In order to maximise package strength; the film is delivered to the forming die in a crease free form and with minimum tension. In the forming step, the film is heated to 100 to 120°C, preferably approximately 110°C, for up to 5 seconds, preferably<br><br>
approximately 700 micro seconds. A heating plate is used to heat the film, which plate is positioned to superpose the forming die. During this preheating step, a vacuum of 0.5 bar is pulled through the pre-heating plate to ensure intimate contact between the film and the pre-heating plate, this intimate contact ensuring that the film is heated evenly and uniformly (the extent of the vacuum is dependant of the thermoforming conditions and the type of film used, however in the present context a vacuum of less than 0.6 bar was found to be suitable) Non-uniform heating results in a formed package having weak spots. In addition to the vacuum, it is possible to blow air against the film to force it into intimate contact with the preheating plate.<br>
The thermoformed film is moulded into the cavities blowing the film off the heating plate and/or by sucking the film into the cavities thus forming a plurality of recesses in the film which, once formed,, are retained in their thermoformed orientation by the application of a vacuum through the walls of the cavities. This vacuum is maintained at least until the packages are sealed. Once the recesses are formed and held in position by the vacuum, a liquid composition according to the invention is added to each of the recesses. A second sheet of polyvinyl alcohol film is then superposed on the first sheet across the filled recesses and heat-sealed thereto using a sealing plate. In this case the heat sealing plate, which is generally flat, operates at a temperature of about 140 to 160°C, and contacts the films for 1 to 2 seconds and with a force of 8 to 30kg/cm2, preferably 10 to 20kg/cm2. The raised flanges surrounding each cavity ensure that the films are sealed together along the flange to form a continuous seal. The radiussed edge of each cavity is at least partly formed by a resiliency deformable material, such as for example silicone rubber. This results in reduced force being applied at the inner edge of the sealing flange to avoid heat/pressure damage to the film.<br>
Once sealed, the packages formed are separated from the web of sheet film using cutting means. At this stage it is possible.to release the vacuum on the die, and eject the formed packages from the forming die. In this way the packages are formed, filled and sealed while nesting in the forming die. In addition they may be cut while in the forming die as well.<br>
During the forming, filling and sealing steps of the process, the relative humidity of the atmosphere is controlled to ca. 50% humidity. This is done to maintain the heat<br><br><br>
sealing characteristics of the film. When handling thinner films, it may be necessary to reduce the relative humidity to ensure that the films have a relatively low degree of plasticisation and are therefore stiffer and easier to handle.<br>
(c) Vertical Form-Fill-Seal<br>
In the vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) technique, a continuous tube of flexible plastics film is extruded. It is sealed, preferably by heat or ultrasonic sealing, at the bottom, filled with the liquid composition, sealed again above the liquid film and then removed from.the continuous, tube, e.g.. by. .cutting..<br>
Unit Dose Volume<br>
The amount of the substantially non-aqueous liquid cleaning composition is each unit dose envelope may for example be from 10ml to 100ml, e.g. from 12.5ml to 75ml, preferably from 15ml to 60ml, more preferably from 20ml to 55ml.<br>
Processing<br>
The present invention also encompasses a process for preparing a concentrated liquid detergent composition comprising nonionic surfactant, an organic solvent and pigment, said process comprising the steps of<br>
-	mixing the nonionic surfactant with the organic solvent,<br>
-	adding to this mixture the pigment in the form of a pigment premix whereby at least 90% of the pigment particles have a particle size of less than 50 micron, preferably less than 30 micron, and<br>
-	adding-other composition ingredients.<br>
In a first step the nonionic surfactant is mixed with the organic solvent. It is essential that the pigment premix is added to a detergent base comprising the organic solvent for proper mixing of the pigment. If linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid is used this is preferably in situ neutralised with ethanolamine in the event that liquid detergent composition is to be encapsulated in a water soluble film. In some cases, NaOH or KOH may also be used in addition or in stead of ethanol amine, depending on the compatibility between the liquid detergent composition and the water-soluble film.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the premix comprises 1-40% pigment, 1-95% of an organic solvent and optionally a surfactant selected from the group consisting of nonionic, anionic, cationic, zwitterionic surfactants and mixtures thereof.<br>
In most cases it is preferred that the premix further comprises at least one preservative.<br>
The premix may be prepared by mixing the pigment and an organic solvent, preferably monopropylene.glycol,, in a bead mili.until the.desiredpartide.size.distribution,, colour strength etc has been obtained. To control the exact particle size distribution this mixture may then passed through an appropriate sieve. The mixture preferably comprises a mixture of a nonionic and a anionic surfactant.<br>
Other than in the examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about". Similarly, all percentages are weight/weight percentages of the liquid detergent composition unless otherwise indicated. Where the term "comprising" is used in the specification or claims, it is not intended to exclude any terms, steps or features not specifically recited.<br>
