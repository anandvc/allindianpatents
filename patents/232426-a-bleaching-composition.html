				<td>Field of the Invention This present invention relates to compositions containing organic catalyst compounds, preferably branched organic catalysts, such as bleach boosting compounds, bleaching species, modified amines and modified amine oxides, sulfonimines, phosphonimines, N-acylimines and thiodiazole dioxides in combination with anionic surfactants, and laundry methods employing same that provide effective bleaching of fabrics and increased resistance to decomposition of the organic catalyst compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to compositions comprising quaternary imine bleach boosting compounds, quaternary oxaziridinium bleaching species, and/or modified amines modified amine oxide compounds, sulfonimines, phosphonimines, N-acylimines and/or thiodiazole dioxides and anionic surfactants, and laundry methods employing same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Oxygen bleaching agents have become increasingly popular in recent years in household and persona] care products to facilitate stain and soil removal. Bleaches are particularly desirable for their stain-removing, dingy fabric cleanup, whitening and sanitization properties. Oxygen bleaching agents have found particular acceptance in laundry products such as detergents, in automatic dishwashing products and in hard surface cleansers. Oxygen bleaching agents, however, are somewhat limited in their effectiveness. Some frequently encountered disadvantages include their lack of fabric color safety and their tendancy to be extremely temperature rate dependent. Thus, the colder the solution in which they are employed, the less effective the bleaching action. Temperatures in excess of 60 °C are typically required for effectiveness of an oxygen bleaching agent in solution.<br>
To solve the aforementioned temperature rate dependency, a class of compounds known as "bleach activators" has been developed. Bleach activators, typically perhydrolyzable acyl compounds having a leaving group such as oxybenzenesulfonate, react with the active oxygen group, typically hydrogen peroxide or its anion, to form a more effective peroxyacid oxidant. It is the peroxyacid compound which then oxidizes the stained or soiled substrate material. However, bleach activators are also somewhat temperature dependent. Bleach activators are more effective<br>
at warm water temperatures of from about 40 °C to about 60 °C. In water temperatures of less than about 40 °C, the peroxyacid compound loses some of its bleaching effectiveness.<br>
Attempts have been made as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,568, 5,360,569 and 5,370,826 all to Madison et al. to develop a bleach system which is effective in lower temperature water conditions. However, the cationic dihydroisoquinolinium bleach boosting compounds disclosed in these references, when combined with peroxygen compounds, undergo undesired decomposition, causing a reduction in organic catalyst compound efficiency.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,282 and 5,817,614 both to Miracle et al. disclose a bleach system<br>
which     is    effective    in    lower    temperature    water    conditions.	The    zwitterionic<br>
dihydroisoquinolinium, organic catalyst compounds, some of which are more or less resistant to decomposition by peroxygen compounds than the cationic dihydroisoquinolinium bleach boosting compounds above, do undergo undesired decomposition, causing a reduction in bleach booster compound efficiency.<br>
Although these references disclose bleaching compositions comprising a bleach boosting compound (cationic dihydroisoquinolinium or zwitterionic dihydroisoquinolinium, which are distinctly different bleach boosting compounds) in the presence of a surfactant (anionic, nonionic, etc.), none of these references recognize or teach a problem with the stability of their respective bleach boosting compounds in the presence of a peroxygen compound, such as a peracid, nor do any of these references teach a synergistic effect between their respective bleach boosting compounds, especially the cationic bleach boosting compounds, and anionic surfactants.<br>
In light of the foregoing, researchers have been trying to develop a bleach system that provides effective bleach boosting compounds, as well as other organic catalyst compounds, such as modified amine compounds, and compositions containing such bleach boosting compounds which provide effective bleaching in lower water temperatures and which^ exhibit increased stability and resist decomposition in the presence of a peroxygen compound. In other words, the researchers have been trying to develop organic catalyst compounds that exhibit a prolonged effective lifetime.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for effective organic catalyst compounds and compositions containing organic catalyst compounds which provide effective bleaching even in lower water temperatures, and resist decomposition by peroxygen compounds.<br>
Summary of the Invention This need is met by the present invention wherein bleaching compositions comprising organic catalyst compounds such as bleach boosting compounds, specifically bleach boosters and/or bleaching species, modified amine compounds and/or modified amine oxide compounds,<br>
sulfonimines, phosphonimines, N-acylimines and/or thiodiazole dioxides in combination with an anionic surfactant are provided that perform effective bleaching at lower water temperatures.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the organic catalyst compounds of the present invention, especially the cationic bleach boosting compounds of the present invention, exhibit prolonged effective lifetimes (increased stability and resistance against decomposition in the presence of a peroxygen compound) in the presence of an anionic surfactant.<br>
The combination of the organic catalyst compounds and the anionic surfactant resists or inhibits the decomposition of the organic catalyst compounds of the present invention-<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound, in conjunction with or without a peroxygen source, and an anionic surfactant is provided.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for laundering a fabric in need of cleaning comprising contacting the fabric with a laundry solution having a bleaching composition in accordance with the present invention as described herein is provided.<br>
In accordance with still yet another aspect of the present invention, a laundry additive product comprising an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant is provided.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide: a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant, wherein the bleaching composition resists decomposition of the organic catalyst compound and effectively prolongs the effective life of the organic catalyst compound compared to a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound without an anionic surfactant; a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant which demonstrates improved performance even in lower temperature solutions; a method for laundering a fabric by employing a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant; and a laundry additive product containing an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant. These, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art from the following description and the appended claims.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. All documents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention discloses bleaching compositions comprising an organic catalyst compound, preferably branched organic catalyst compound* and an anionic surfactant which provide superior bleaching performance compared to bleaching compositions comprising an organic catalyst compound without an anionic surfactant.<br>
The present invention further discloses bleaching compositions comprising an organic catalyst compound and an anionic surfactant which resist or inhibit the decomposition of the organic catalyst compound compared to bleaching compositions comprising an organic catalyst compound without an anionic surfactant. This resistance or inhibition to decompose results in the organic catalyst compounds having a prolonged effective life compared to organic catalyst compounds present in bleaching compositions without an anionic surfactant.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention provide increased bleaching effectiveness even in lower temperature applications while being resistant to unwanted decomposition by aromatization, resulting in longer lasting performance.<br>
The organic catalyst compounds of the present invention act in conjunction with or without, preferably with conventional peroxygen bleaching sources to provide the above-mentioned increased bleaching effectiveness and superior resistance to aromatization. DEFINITIONS<br>

A variety of anionic surfactants are also generally disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,929,678, issued December 30, 1975 to Laughlin, et al. at Column 23, line 58 through Column 29, line 23.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention typically comprise from about 1%, preferably from about 3% to about 40%, preferably about 20% by weight of one or more anionic surfactants. DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC CATALYSTS<br>
The organic catalysis, specifically the bleach boosting compounds of the present invention are susceptible to decomposition by various decomposition pathways including, but not limited to, the aromatization pathway. The aromatization (decomposition) reaction of 6-membered ring boosters is well known in the art, as exemplified, without being limited by theory, in Hanquet et al., Tetrahedron 1993, 49, pp. 423-438. Other means of decomposition include, but are not limited to, attack on the bleach boosting compound and/or on the bleaching species by nucleophiles, including but not limited to attack by hydroxide anion, perhydroxide anion, carboxylate anion, percarboxylate anion and other nucleophiles present under in-wash conditions. For example, and without intending to be bound by theory, the decomposition reaction of a 6-membered ring oxaziridinium, the overall process of which can lead to reduced bleaching efficiency, is exemplified as set forth below:<br><br>

METHODS   FOR DELAYED  (CONTROLLED)  ADDITION  OF  ORGANIC  CATALYST COMPOUNDS<br>
It has surprisingly been found with organic catalyst compounds of limited lifetime, that the addition of organic catalyst compounds by a delivery means to a wash solution after a fabric has been added to a wash solution provides enhanced bleaching compared to the addition of such organic catalyst compounds to the wash solution before a fabric has been added to the wash solution. It is believed, without being limited by theory, that the organic catalyst compound undergoes decomposition in the wash solution prior to the introduction of the fabric load. One method for improving the performance of organic catalyst compounds is to delay (control) the addition of the organic catalyst compound of the present invention to the wash solution. Methods for delayed (controlled) addition of organic catalyst compounds are more fully described in copending and co-owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled "Controlled Availability of Formulation Components, Compositions and Laundry Methods Employing Same" filed August 27, 1999 (P&amp;G Attorney Docket Number 7749P).<br>
Another method of improving the performance of organic catalyst compounds is to use an organic catalyst compound with increased stability to the wash conditions. This application describes a method of improving the performance of organic catalyst compounds by bleaching compositions comprising organic catalyst compounds, specifically bleach boosting compounds, more specifically bleach boosters and/or bleaching species, in combination with an anionic surfactant that perform effective bleaching at lower water temperatures.<br>
This application describes organic catalyst compounds which may fall in either category, having a short or long lifetime, and as such can be added prior to or after the introduction of the fabric, depending on the desired application and desired bleaching result in terms of overall performance and color safety. BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ORGANIC CATALYST COMPOUNDS<br>
In addition to the use of organic catalyst compounds discussed above, the organic catalyst compounds of the present invention may be employed in conjunction with a peroxygen source in other bleaching compositions, regardless of their form. For example, the organic catalyst compounds may be employed in a laundry additive product. In the bleaching compositions of the present invention, the peroxygen source may be present in levels of from about 0.1% to about 60% by weight of the composition, and preferably from about 1% to about 40% by weight of the composition. In a composition, the organic catalyst may be present from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the composition, and more preferably from about 0.005% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention may be advantageously employed in laundry applications, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing applications, as well as cosmetic applications such as dentures, teeth, hair and skin. However, due to the unique advantages of increased effectiveness in cold and possibly warm water solutions due to possible increased stability, the organic catalyst compounds of the present invention are ideally suited for laundry applications such as the bleaching of fabrics through the use of bleach-containing detergents or laundry bleach additives. Furthermore, the organic catalyst compounds of the present invention may be employed in both granular and liquid compositions.<br>
Accordingly, the bleaching compositions of the present invention may include various additional ingredients which are desirable in laundry applications. Such ingredients include detersive surfactants, bleach catalysts, builders, chelating agents, enzymes, polymeric soil release agents, brighteners and various other ingredients. Compositions including any of these various additional ingredients preferably have a pH of from about 6 to about 12, preferably from about 8 to about 10.5 in a 1% solution of the bleaching composition.<br>
The bleaching compositions preferably include at least one detersive surfactant, at least one chelating agent, at least one detersive enzyme and preferably has a pH of about 6 to about 12, preferably from about 8 to about 10.5 in a 1% solution of the bleaching composition.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for laundering a fabric in need of laundering is provided. The preferred method comprises contacting the fabric with a laundry solution. The fabric may comprise most any fabric capable of being laundered in normal consumer use conditions. The laundry solution comprises a bleaching composition, as fully described herein. The water temperatures preferably range from about 0 °C to about 50 °C or higher. The water to fabric ratio is preferably from about 1:1 to about 15:1.<br>
The laundry solution may further include at least one additional ingredient selected from the group consisting of detersive surfactants, chelating agents, detersive enzymes and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the laundry solution has a pH of about 6 to about 12, preferably from about 8 to about 10.5 in a 1% solution of the bleaching composition.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a laundry additive product is provided. The laundry additive product comprises an organic catalyst compound, as fully described above. Such a laundry additive product would be ideally suited for inclusion in a wash process when additional bleaching effectiveness is desired. Such instances may include, but are not limited to, low-temperature and medium temperature solution laundry application.<br>
It is desirable that the laundry additive product further includes a peroxygen source, as fully described above. The laundry additive product can also include powdered or liquid compositions containing a hydrogen peroxide source or a peroxygen source as fully defined above.<br>
Furthermore, if the laundry additive product includes a hydrogen peroxide source, it is desirable that the laundry additive product further includes a bleach activator, as fully described above.<br>
Preferably, the laundry additive product is packaged in dosage form for addition to a laundry process where a source of peroxygen is employed and increased bleaching effectiveness is desired. Such single dosage form may comprise a pill, tablet, gelcap or other single dosage unit such as pre-measured powders or liquids. A filler or carrier material may be included to increase the volume of composition if desired. Suitable filler or carrier materials may be selected from but not limited to various salts of sulfate, carbonate and silicate as well as talc, clay and the like. Filler or carrier materials for liquid compositions may be water or low molecular weight primary and secondary alcohols including polyols and diols. Examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol. Monohydric alcohols may also be employed. The compositions may contain from about 5% to about 90% of such materials. Acidic fillers can be used to reduce pH.<br>
A preferred bleaching composition is a bleaching composition comprising:<br>
(a)	a peroxygen source;<br>
(b)	one or more organic catalyst compounds; and<br>
(c)	one or more anionic surfactants.<br>
The peroxygen source, like discussed above, is preferably selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(i) preformed peracid compounds selected from the group consisting of percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, perimidic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfiiric acids and salts, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
(ii) hydrogen peroxide sources selected from the group consisting of perborate compounds, percarbonate compounds, perphosphate compounds and mixtures thereof, and a bleach activator.<br>
Preferably, the peroxygen source is selected from hydrogen peroxide sources selected from the group consisting of perborate compounds, percarbonate compounds, perphosphate compounds and mixtures thereof, and a bleach activator.<br>
More preferably, the bleach activator is selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic bleach activators as disclosed herein.<br>
The period of time between the peracid becoming active in a wash solution and the organic catalyst compounds becoming active can be in the range of from about 1 second to about 24 hours.<br>
The purpose of a delayed addition bleaching composition (which may or may not be used in conjunction with this invention) is to allow the peracid to achieve maximum bleaching performance on a fabric in need of cleaning, such as a stained fabric, in a wash solution prior to the introduction of the organic catalyst compound. In other words, a bleaching composition comprising a organic catalyst compound which becomes active in a wash solution after a fabric in need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution. Alternatively, since the organic catalyst compounds can have increased stability, a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound which becomes active in a wash solution prior to a fabric in need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution may be used.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention also comprise, in addition to one or more organic catalysts, described hereinbefore, one or more cleaning adjunct materials, preferably compatible with the organic catalyst(s) and/or any enzymes present in the bleaching composition. The term "compatible", as used herein, means the bleaching composition materials do not reduce<br><br><br>
the bleaching activity of the organic catalyst and/or any enzymatic activity of any enzyme present in the bleaching composition to such an extent that the organic catalyst and/or enzyme is not effective as desired during normal use situations. The term "cleaning adjunct materials", as used herein, means any liquid, solid or gaseous material selected for the particular type of bleaching composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid; granule; powder; bar; paste; spray; tablet; gel; foam composition), which materials are also preferably compatible with the protease enzyme(s) and bleaching agent(s) used in the composition. Granular compositions can also be in "compact" form and the liquid compositions can also be in a "concentrated" form.<br>
The specific selection of cleaning adjunct materials are readily made by considering the surface, item or fabric to be cleaned, and the desired form of the composition for the cleaning conditions during use (e.g., through the wash detergent use). Examples of suitable cleaning adjunct materials include, but are not limited to, surfactants, builders, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, other enzymes, enzyme stabilizing systems, chelants, optical brighteners, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersants, suds suppressors, dyes, perfumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, perservatives, anti-oxidants, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, color speckles, silvercare, anti-tamish and/or anti-corrosion agents, alkalinity sources, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments and pH control agents as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115, 5,698,504, 5,695,679, 5,686,014 and 5,646,101. Specific bleaching composition materials are exemplified in detail hereinafter.<br>
If the cleaning adjunct materials are not compatible with the protease variant(s) in the bleaching compositions, then suitable methods of keeping the cleaning adjunct materials and the protease variant(s) separate (not in contact with each other) until combination of the two components is appropriate can be used. Suitable methods can be any method known in the art, such as gelcaps, encapulation, tablets, physical separation, etc.<br>

The fabric bleaching compositions of the present invention are mainly intended to be used in the wash cycle of a washing machine; however, other uses can be contemplated, such as pretreatment product for heavily-soiled fabrics, or soaking product; the use is not necessarily<br>
limited to the washing-machine context, and the compositions of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with compatible handwash compositions.<br>
The bleaching compositions may include from about 1% to about 99.9% by weight of the composition of the cleaning adjunct materials.<br>
As used herein, "non-fabric bleaching compositions" include hard surface bleaching compositions, dishwashing compositions, oral bleaching compositions, denture bleaching compositions and personal cleansing compositions.<br>

If needed the density of the laundry detergent compositions herein ranges from 400 to 1200 g/litre, preferably 500 to 950 g/litre of composition measured at 20 °C.<br>
The "compact" form of the bleaching compositions herein is best reflected by density and, in terms of composition, by the amount of inorganic filler salt; inorganic filler salts are conventional ingredients of detergent compositions in powder form; in conventional detergent compositions, the filler salts are present in substantial amounts, typically 17-35% by weight of the total composition. In the compact compositions, the filler salt is present in amounts not exceeding 15% of the total composition, preferably not exceeding 10%, most preferably not exceeding 5% by weight of the composition.

LFNI may be present in amounts from 0.01% to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%, and most preferably from about 0.25% to about 4%. LFNIs are most typically used in ADDs on account of the improved water-sheeting action (especially from glass) which they confer to the ADD product. They also encompass non-silicone, nonphosphate polymeric materials further illustrated hereinafter which are known to defoam food soils encountered in automatic dishwashing.<br>
Preferred LFNIs include nonionic alkoxylated surfactants, especially ethoxylates derived from primary alcohols, and blends thereof with more sophisticated surfactants, such as the polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene (PO/EO/PO) reverse block polymers as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464 and 5,710,115.<br>
LFNIs which may also be used include those POLY-TERGENT® SLF-18 nonionic surfactants from Olin Corp.., and any biodegradable LFNI having the melting point properties discussed hereinabove.<br>

e.	Metal-containing Bleach Catalysts - The bleaching compositions can also optionally<br>
include metal-containing bleach catalysts, preferrably manganese and cobalt-containing bleach<br>
catalysts.<br>
One type of metal-containing bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium tungsten, molybdenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenedjarninetetra (methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 Bragg, issued February 2, 1982.<br>
i. Manganese Metal Complexes - If desired, the compositions herein can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds and levels of use are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,576,282 Miracle et al., issued November 19, 1996; U.S. 5,246,621 Favre et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,244,594 Favre et al., issued September 14, 1993; U.S. 5,194,416 Jureller et al., issued March 16, 1993; U.S. 5,114,606 van Vliet et al., issued May 19, 1992; and European Pat.

Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 included by reference herein above and U.S. 5,114,611 van Kralingen, issued May 19, 1992. The use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following: U.S. 4,728,455 Rerek, issued March 1, 1988; U.S. 5,284,944 Madison, issued Februaary 8, 1994; U.S. 5,246,612 van Dijk et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,256,779 Kerschner et al., issued October 26, 2993; U.S. 5,280,117 Kerschner et al., issued January 18, 1994; U.S. 5,274,147 Kerschner et al., issued December 28, 1993; U.S. 5,153,161 Kerschner et al., issued October 6, 1992; and U.S. 5,227,084 Martens et al., issued July 13, 1993.<br>

Cobalt Metal Complexes - Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in U.S. 5,597,936 Perkins et al., issued January 28, 1997; U.S. 5,595,967 Miracle et al., January 21, 1997; U.S. 5,703,030 Perkins et al., issued December 30, 1997; and M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg.<br>
Mech., (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Tv, wherein "OAc" represents an<br>
acetate moiety and  "Ty"  is an  anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride,<br>
[Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2;      as     well      as     [Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2;      [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2;<br>
[Co(NH3)5OAc](SO4); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](NO3)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. 5,597,936, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,703,030, cited herein above, the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, J. Chem. Ed. (1989), 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; Inore. Chem.. 18, 1497-1502 (1979); Inorg. Chem.. 21_, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176 (1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry. 56, 22-25 (1952).<br>
iii. Transition Metal Complexes of Macropolvcvclic Rigid Ligands -Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mn are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid" has<br>
been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews., (1993), 93, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zirnmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta, (1989). 164,73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A<br>
"cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1.11, the cross-bridge is a -<br>
CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N   and N   in the illustrative structure. By comparison, a "same-<br>
side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N   and N      in 1.11, would not be<br>
sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(III), Fe(lV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(III), Cr(II), Cr(III), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(II), Ru(III), and Ru(IV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, the MRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein suitably comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the rigidity of the<br>
macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al., see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it co-ordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 1 wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 2 wherein m and n are integers from about 1 to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, O, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound:<br><br>

Preferably, the bleach activator is selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic bleach activators as disclosed herein.<br>
The purpose of such a bleaching composition is to mitigate unwanted decomposition of the organic catalyst.<br>
Bleaching Agents - The compositions of the present invention optionally comprise, in addition to the bleaching system described above, additional bleaching agents, such as chlorine bleaches (although less preferred for compositions which comprise enzymes) examples of which are known in the art, and include sodium dichloroisocyanurate ("NaDCC) and bleach catalysts. When present, these other bleaching agents will typically be at levels of from about 1%, preferably from about 5% to about 30%, preferably to about 20% by weight of the composition.<br>
(a)	Organic Peroxides, especially Diacvl Peroxides - These are extensively illustrated in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 17, John Wiley and Sons, 1982 at pages 27-90 and especially at pages 63-72, all incorporated herein by reference. If a diacyl peroxide is used, it will preferably be one which exerts minimal adverse impact on spotting/filming.<br>
(b)	Metal-containing; Bleach Catalysts - The present invention compositions and methods may utilize metal-containing bleach catalysts that are effective for use in bleaching compositions. Preferred are manganese and cobalt-containing bleach catalysts.<br>
One type of metal-containing bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium tungsten, molybdenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetra (methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 Bragg, issued February 2, 1982.<br>
Manganese Metal Complexes - If desired, the compositions herein can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds and levels of use are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,282; 5,246,621; 5,244,594; 5,194,416; and 5,114,606; and European Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 549,271 Al, 549,272 Al, 544,440 A2, and 544,490 Al; Preferred examples of these catalysts include MnIV2(u-0)3(l,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(PF6)2, Mnni2(u-0)i(u-OAc)2(l,4,7-<br>
trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(C104)2, MnIV4(u-O)6( 1,4,7-triazacyclononane)4(C104)4, MninMnIV4(u-O) ] (u-OAc)2.(l ,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(C1O4)3, MnIV(l ,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)- (OCH3 )(3PFg), and mixtures thereof. Other metal-based<br>
bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,430,243 and U.S. 5,114,611. The<br>
use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the<br>
following: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,728,455; 5,284,944; 5,246,612; 5,256,779; 5,280,117; 5,274,147;<br>
5,153,161; and 5,227,084.<br>
Cobalt Metal Complexes - Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,597,936; 5,595,967; and 5,703,030; and M. L. Tobe,<br>
"Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg. Mech.. (1983), 2, pages<br>
1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Tv, wherein "OAc" represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an<br>
anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2; as well as<br>
[Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)50Ac](SO4); [Co-(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](N03)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,597,936; 5,595,967; and 5,703,030; in the Tobe article and the references cited therein; and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410; J. Chem. Ed. (1989), 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; lnorg. Chem.. Jl, 1497-1502 (1979); Inorg. Chem.. 21, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176 (1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry. 56, 22-25 (1952).<br>
Transition Metal Complexes of Macropolvcyclic Rigid Ligands - Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mn are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid" has been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews., (1993), 93, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zimmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta. (19891 164. 73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A<br>
"cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1.11, the cross-bridge is a -<br>
1	8<br>
CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N  and N  in the illustrative structure. By comparison, a "same-<br>
1	12<br>
side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N   and N     in 1.11, would not be<br>
sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br><br><br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(III), Fe(IV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(III), Cr(II), Cr(III), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(II), Ru(III), and Ru(lV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, the MRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein suitably comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the rigidity of the macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al., see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it co-ordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 1 wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 2 wherein m and n are integers from about 1 to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, triaikylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, O, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound:<br>

As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide<br>
from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor. In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the bleaching compositions.<br>
(d) Other Bleach Catalysts - The compositions herein may comprise one or more other bleach catalysts. Preferred bleach catalysts are zwitterionic bleach catalysts, which are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,576,282 (especially 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium) propane sulfonate. Other bleach catalysts include cationic bleach catalysts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,569, 5,442,066, 5,478,357, 5,370,826, 5,482,515, 5,550,256, and WO 95/13351, WO 95/13352, and WO 95/13353.<br>
Enzymes - The bleaching compositions can comprise in addition to the amylase of the present invention one or more detergent enzymes which provide cleaning performance and/or fabric care benefits. Such enzymes can include proteases, amylases, cellulases and lipases. They may be incorporated into the non-aqueous liquid bleaching compositions herein in the form of suspensions, "marumes" or "prills". Another suitable type of enzyme comprises those in the form of slurries of enzymes in nonionic surfactants, e.g., the enzymes marketed by Novo Nordisk under the tradename "SL" or the microencapsulated enzymes marketed by Novo Nordisk under the tradename "LDP." Suitable enzymes and levels of use are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115, 5,576,282, 5,728,671 and 5,707,950.<br>
Enzymes added to the compositions herein in the form of conventional enzyme prills are especially preferred for use herein. Such prills will generally range in size from about 100 to 1,000 microns, more preferably from about 200 to 800 microns and will be suspended throughout the non-aqueous liquid phase of the composition. Prills in the compositions of the present invention have been found, in comparison with other enzyme forms, to exhibit especially desirable enzyme stability in terms of retention of enzymatic activity over time. Thus, compositions which utilize enzyme prills need not contain conventional enzyme stabilizing such as must frequently be used when enzymes are incorporated into aqueous liquid detergents.<br>
However, enzymes added to the compositions herein may be in the form of granulates, preferably T-granulates. successive improvements, have a remaining degree of bleach deactivation susceptibility.<br>
Examples of suitable enzymes include, but are not limited to, hemicellulases, peroxidases, proteases, cellulases, xylanases, lipases, phospholipases, esterases, cutinases, pectinases, keratanases,   reductases,   oxidases,   phenoloxidases,   lipoxygenases,   ligninases,   pullulanases,<br>
tannases, pentosanases, malanases, B-glucanases, arabinosidases, hyaluronidase, chondroitinase, laccase, and known amylases, or mixtures thereof. A preferred combination is a bleaching composition having a cocktail of conventional applicable enzymes like protease, lipase, cutinase and/or cellulase in conjunction with the amylase of the present invention.<br>
Suitable proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis (subtilisin BPN and BPN'). One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE® by Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo". The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1,243,784 to Novo. Other suitable proteases include ALCALASE®, DURAZYM® and SAVINASE® from Novo and MAXATASE®, MAXACAL®, PROPERASE® and MAXAPEM® (protein engineered Maxacal) from Gist-Brocades. Proteolytic enzymes also encompass modified bacterial serine proteases, such as those described in European Patent Application Serial Number 87 303761.8, filed April 28, 1987 (particularly pages 17, 24 and 98), and which is called herein "Protease B", and in European Patent Application 199,404, Venegas, published October 29, 1986, which refers to a modified bacterial serine protealytic enzyme which is called "Protease A" herein. More preferred is what is called herein "Protease C", which is a variant of an alkaline serine protease from Bacillus in which lysine replaced arginine at position 27, tyrosine replaced valine at position 104, serine replaced asparagine at position 123, and alanine replaced threonine at position 274. Protease C is described in EP 90915958:4, corresponding to WO 91/06637, Published May 16, 1991. Genetically modified variants, particularly of Protease C, are also included herein. See also a high pH protease from Bacillus sp. NCIMB 40338 described in WO 93/18140 A to Novo. Enzymatic detergents comprising protease, one or more other enzymes, and a reversible protease inhibitor are described in WO 92/03529 A to Novo. When desired, a protease having decreased adsorption and increased hydrolysis is available as described in WO 95/07791 to Procter &amp; Gamble. A recombinant trypsin-like protease for detergents suitable herein is described in WO 94/25583 to Novo.<br>
In more detail, the protease referred to as "Protease D" is a carbonyl hydrolase variant having an amino acid sequence not found in nature, which is derived from a precursor carbonyl hydrolase by substituting a different amino acid for a plurality of amino acid residues at a position in said carbonyl hydrolase equivalent to position +76, preferably also in combination with one or more amino acid residue positions equivalent to those selected from the group consisting of +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123, +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, +135, +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265, and/or +274 according to the numbering of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin, as described in WO 95/10615 published April 20, 1995<br>

See also W094/18314, Genencor, published August 18, 1994 and WO95/10603, Novo Nordisk A/S, published April 20, 1995. Other amylases known for use in bleaching compositions include both a- and p-amylases. a-Amylases are known in the art and include those disclosed in US Pat. 5,003,257; EP 252,666; WO 91/00353; FR 2,676,456; EP 285,123; EP 525,610; EP 368,341; and British Patent Specification No. 1,296,839 (Novo).

activity assay. Other amylolytic enzymes with improved properties with respect to the activity level and the combination of thermostability and a higher activity level are described in W095/35382.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a mannanase enzyme. Preferably, the mannanase is selected from the group consisting of: three mannans-degrading enzymes : EC 3.2.1.25 : (3-mannosidase, EC 3.2.1.78 : Endo-l,4-p-mannosidase, referred therein after as "mannanase" and EC 3.2.1.100 : 1,4-p-mannobiosidase and mixtures thereof. (IUPAC Classification- Enzyme nomenclature, 1992 ISBN 0-12-227165-3 Academic Press).<br>
More preferably, the treating compositions of the present invention, when a mannanase is present, comprise a [3-1,4-Mannosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.78) referred to as Mannanase. The term "mannanase" or "galactomannanase" denotes a mannanase enzyme defined according to the art as officially being named mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase and having the alternative names beta-mannanase and endo-l,4-mannanase and catalysing the reaction: random hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D- mannosidic linkages in mannans, galactomannans, glucomannans, and galactoglucomannans.<br>
In particular, Mannanases (EC 3.2.1.78) constitute a group of polysaccharases which degrade mannans and denote enzymes which are capable of cleaving polyose chains contaning mannose units, i.e. are capable of cleaving glycosidic bonds in mannans, glucomannans, galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans. Mannans are polysaccharides having a backbone composed of 0-1,4- linked mannose; glucomannans are polysaccharides having a backbone or more or less regularly alternating (3-1,4 linked mannose and glucose; galactomannans and galactoglucomannans are mannans and glucomannans with a. 1,6 linked galactose sidebranches. These compounds may be acetylated.<br>
The degradation of galactomannans and galactoglucomannans is facilitated by full or partial removal of the galactose sidebranches. Further the degradation of the acetylated mannans, glucomannans, galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans is facilitated by full or partial deacetylation. Acetyl groups can be removed by alkali or by mannan acetylesterases. The oligomers which are released from the mannanases or by a combination of mannanases and a-galactosidase and/or mannan acetyl esterases can be further degraded to release free maltose by p-mannosidase and/or P-glucosidase.<br>
Mannanases have been identified in several Bacillus organisms. For example, Talbot et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Vol.56, No. 11, pp. 3505-3510 (1990) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus in dimer form having<br><br>
molecular weight of 162 kDa and an optimum pH of 5.5-7.5. Mendoza et al., World J. Microbiol. Biotech., Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 551-555 (1994) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus subtilis having a molecular weight of 38 kDa, an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 55C and a pi of 4.8. JP-03047076 discloses a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus sp., having a molecular weight of 373 kDa measured by gel filtration, an optimum pH of 8-10 and a pi of 5.3-5.4. JP-63056289 describes the production of an alkaline, thermostable beta-mannanase which hydrolyses beta-l,4-D-mannopyranoside bonds of e.g. mannans and produces manno-oligosaccharides. JP-63036774 relates to the Bacillus microorganism FERM P-8856 which produces beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase at an alkaline pH. JP-08051975 discloses alkaline beta-mannanases from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. AM-001. A purified mannanase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens useful in-the bleaching of pulp and paper and a method of preparation thereof is disclosed in WO 97/11164. WO 91/18974 describes a hemicellulase such as a glucanase, xylanase or mannanase active at an extreme pH and temperature. WO 94/25576 discloses an enzyme from Aspergillus aculeatus, CBS 101.43, exhibiting mannanase activity which may be useful for degradation or modification of plant or algae cell wall material. WO 93/24622 discloses a mannanase isolated from Trichoderma reseei useful for bleaching lignocellulosic pulps. An hemicellulase capable of degrading mannan-containing hemicellulose is described in W091/18974 and a purified mannanase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is described in W097/11164.<br>

The plasmid pBXMl comprising the polynucleotide molecule (the DNA sequence) encoding a mannanase of the present invention has been transformed into a strain of the Escherichia coli which was deposited by the inventors according to the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Mascheroder Weg lb, D-38124 Braunschweig, Federal Republic of Germany, on 7 October 1998 under the deposition number DSM 12433.<br>
The mannanase, when present, is incorporated into the treating compositions of the present invention preferably at a level of from 0.0001% to 2%, more preferably from 0.0005% to 0.1%, most preferred from 0.001% to 0.02% pure enzyme by weight of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a xyloglucanase enzyme. Suitable xyloglucanases for the purpose of the present invention are enzymes exhibiting endoglucanase activity specific for xyloglucan, preferably at a level of from about 0.001% to about 1%, more preferably from about 0.01% to abour0.l5%, by weight of the composition. As used herein, the term "endoglucanase activity" means the capability of the enzyme to hydrolyze 1,4-P-D-glycosidic linkages present in any cellulosic material, such as cellulose, cellulose derivatives, lichenin, J3-D-glucan, or xyloglucan. The endoglucanase activity may be determined in accordance with methods known in the art, examples of which are described in WO 94/14953 and hereinafter. One unit of endoglucanase activity (e.g. CMCU, AVTU, XGU or BGU) is defined as the production of 1 fxmol reducing sugar/min from a glucan substrate, the glucan substrate being, e.g., CMC (CMCU), acid swollen Avicell (AVIU), xyloglucan (XGU) or cereal p-glucan (BGU). The reducing sugars are determined as described in WO 94/14953 and hereinafter. The specific activity of an endoglucanase towards a substrate is defined as units/mg of protein.<br><br>
term is intended to refer to a DNA sequence which is at least 70% homologous to any of the sequences shown above encoding an endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan, including at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or even at least 95% with any of the sequences shown above. The term is intended to include modifications of any of the DNA sequences shown above, such as nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism into which a DNA construct comprising any of the DNA sequences is introduced or nucleotide substitutions which do give rise to a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different protein structure which might give rise to an endoglucanase mutant with different properties than the native enzyme. Other examples of possible modifications are insertion of one or more nucleotides into the sequence, addition of one or more nucleotides at either end of the sequence, or deletion of one or more nucleotides at either end or within the sequence.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan useful in the present invention preferably is one which has a XGU/BGU, XGU/CMU and/or XGU/AVIU ratio (as defined above) of more than 50, such as 75, 90 or 100.<br>
Furthermore, the endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan is preferably substantially devoid of activity towards |3-glucan and/or exhibits at the most 25% such as at the most 10% or about 5%, activity towards carboxymethyl cellulose and/or Avicell when the activity towards xyloglucan is 100%. In addition, endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan of the invention is preferably substantially devoid of transferase activity, an activity which has been observed for most endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan of plant origin.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan may be obtained from the fungal species A. aculeatus, as described in WO 94/14953. Microbial endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan has also been described in WO 94/14953. Endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan from plants have been described, but these enzymes have transferase activity and therefore must be considered inferior to microbial endoglucanses specific for xyloglucan whenever extensive degradation of xyloglucan is desirable. An additional advantage of a microbial enzyme is that it, in general, may be produced in higher amounts in a microbial host, than enzymes of other origins.<br>
The xyloglucanase, when present, is incorporated into the treating compositions of the invention preferably at a level of from 0.0001% to 2%, more preferably from 0.0005% to 0.1%, most preferred from 0.001% to 0.02% pure enzyme by weight of the composition.<br>
The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Also included by definition, are mutants of native enzymes. Mutants can be obtained e.g. by protein and/or genetic engineering, chemical and/or physical modifications of native enzymes. Common practice as well is the expression of the enzyme via host organisms in which the genetic material responsible for the production of the enzyme has been cloned.<br>
Said enzymes are normally incorporated in the bleaching composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of active enzyme by weight of the bleaching composition. The enzymes can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc. containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes ( e.g. cogranulates).<br>

Enzyme materials useful for liquid detergent formulations, and their incorporation into such formulations, are disclosed in U.S. 4,261,868, Hora etal, April 14, 1981. Enzyme Stabilizers - Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilized by various techniques. Enzyme stabilization techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. 3,600,319, EP 199,405 and EP 200,586. Enzyme stabilization systems are also described, for example, in U.S. 3,519,570. A useful Bacillus, sp. AC13 giving proteases, xylanases and cellulases, is described in WO 9401532. The enzymes employed herein can be stabilized by the presence of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Suitable enzyme stabilizers and levels of use are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115 and 5,576,282.<br>
Builders - The detergent and bleaching compositions described herein preferably comprise one or more detergent builders or builder systems. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder, preferably from about 5%, more preferably from about 10% to about 80%, preferably to about 50%, more preferably to about 30% by weight, of detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Preferred builders for use in the detergent and bleaching compositions, particularly<br>
dishwashing compositions, described herein include, but are not limited to, water-soluble builder<br>
compounds, (for example polycarboxylates) as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,695,679,<br>
5,705,464 and 5,710,115.	Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,144,226, 3,308,067 and 3,723,322. Preferred polycarboxylates are hydroxycarboxylates containing up to three carboxy groups per molecule, more particularly titrates.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137), phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates.<br>
However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeoliteorlayered silicate builders. -<br>
Suitable silicates include the water-soluble sodium silicates with an Si02:Na20 ratio of from about 1.0 to 2.8, with ratios of from about 1.6 to 2.4 being preferred, and about 2.0 ratio being most preferred. The silicates may be in the form of either the anhydrous salt or a hydrated salt. Sodium silicate with an Si02:Na20 ratio of 2.0 is the most preferred. Silicates, when present, are preferably present in the detergent and bleaching compositions described herein at a level of from about 5% to about 50% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 10% to about 40% by weight.<br>
Partially soluble or insoluble builder compounds, which are suitable for use in the detergent and bleaching compositions, particularly granular detergent compositions, include, but are not limited to, crystalline layered silicates, preferably crystalline layered sodium silicates (partially water-soluble) as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,664,839, and sodium aluminosilicates (water-insoluble). .When present in detergent and bleaching compositions, these builders are typically present at a level of from about 1% to 80% by weight, preferably from about 10% to 70% by weight, most preferably from about 20% to 60% by weight of the composition.<br>
Crystalline layered sodium silicates having the general formula NaMSixC&gt;2x+1 -yr^O<br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from about 1.9 to about 4, preferably from about 2 to about 4, most preferably 2, and y is a number from about 0 to about 20, preferably 0 can be used in the compositions described herein. Crystalline layered sodium silicates of this type are disclosed in EP-A-0164514 and methods for their preparation are disclosed in DE-A-3417649 and DE-A-3742043. The most preferred material is deIta-Na2SiO5, available from Hoechst AG<br>
as NaSKS-6 (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum.  NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form<br>
of layered silicate.   SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use in the compositions<br>
described herein herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSix02x+ryH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably<br>
2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used in the compositions described herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms.   As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most<br>
preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
The crystalline layered sodium silicate material is preferably present in granular detergent compositions as a particulate in intimate admixture with a solid, water-soluble ionizable material. The solid, water-soluble ionizable material is preferably selected from organic acids, organic and inorganic acid salts and mixtures thereof.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders have the empirical formula: [Mz(A1O2)y]xH2O<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264. Preferably, the aluminosilicate builder is an aluminosilicate zeolite having the unit cell formula: Nai(A1O2)z(SiO2)y] xH2O<br>
wherein z and y are at least 6; the molar ratio of z to y is from 1.0 to 0.5 and x is at least 5, preferably 7.5 to 276, more preferably from 10 to 264. The aluminosilicate builders are preferably in hydrated form and are preferably crystalline, containing from about 10% to about 28%, more preferably from abbut18%to about 22% water in bound form.<br>
These aluminosilicate ion exchange materials can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B, Zeolite P, Zeolite X, Zeolite MAP and Zeolite HS and mixtures thereof. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter. Zeolite X has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions described herein are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-<br>
1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984.  Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof.   A particularly<br>
preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid.    Specific examples of succinate<br>
builders include:   laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate,  2-dodecenylsuccinate<br>
(preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of<br>
this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published<br>
Novembers, 1986.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator. Dispersants - One or more suitable polyalkyleneimine dispersants may be incorporated into the cleaning compositions of the present invention. Examples of such suitable dispersants can be found in European Patent Application Nos. 111,965, 111,984, and 112,592; U.S. Patent Nos. 4,597,898, 4,548,744, and 5,565,145. However, any suitable clay/soil dispersent or anti-redepostion agent can be used in the laundry compositions of the present invention.<br>
In addition, polymeric-dispersing-agents which include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, are suitable for use in the present invention. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in U.S. 3,308,067.<br><br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000. The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid/maleic acid copolymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include'the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol-terpolymers. Sueh materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000.<br>

The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like.<br>
If utilized, these chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.1% to about 15%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 3.0% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. Suds suppressor - Another optional ingredient is a suds suppressor, exemplified by silicones, and silica-silicone mixtures. Examples of suitable suds suppressors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,707,950 and 5,728,671. These suds suppressors are normally employed at levels of from 0.001% to 2% by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.01% to 1% by weight. Softening agents - Fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. Inorganic softening agents are exemplified by the smectite clays disclosed in GB-A-1 400 898 and in U.S. 5,019,292. Organic softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines as disclosed in GB-A-1 514 276 and EP-B-011 340 and their combination with mono C12-C14 quaternary ammonium salts are disclosed in EP-B-026 527 and EP-B-026 528 and di-long-chain amides as disclosed in EP-B-0 242 919.

In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymers are made in such a way that they form a three-dimensional rigid structure, which can entrap dyes in the pores formed by the three-dimensional structure. In another embodiment, the cross-linked polymers entrap the dyes by swelling. Such cross-linked polymers are described in the co-pending European patent application 94870213.9.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes according the invention.<br>
pH and Buffering Variation - Many of the detergent and bleaching compositions described herein will be buffered, i.e., they are relatively resistant to pH drop in the presence of acidic soils. However, other compositions herein may have exceptionally low buffering capacity, or may be substantially unbuffered. Techniques for controlling or varying pH at recommended usage levels more generally include the use of not only buffers, but also additional alkalis, acids, pH-jump systems, dual compartment containers, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The preferred ADD compositions herein comprise a pH-adjusting component selected from water-soluble alkaline inorganic salts and water-soluble organic or inorganic builders as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464 and 5,710,115.<br>
