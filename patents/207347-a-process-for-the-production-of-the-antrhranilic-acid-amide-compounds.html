  "A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE <br>
     ANTRHRANILIC ACID AMIDE COMPOUNDS"<br><br>
SCHERING AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, of Mullerstrasse  178, D-<br>
13342	Berlin,	Germany	and	NOVARTIS<br>
AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   of  Schwarzwaldallee   215,   CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The    following    specification    particularly    describes    the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The invention relates to anthranilic acid amides and their use as pharmaceutical agents for treatment of diseases that are triggered by persistent angiogenesis as well as their intermediate products for the production of anthranilic acid amides.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis can be the cause of various diseases such as psoriasis, arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma, eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy, fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial-cell-proliferative diseases, and arteriosclerosis or can result in a progression of these diseases.<br>
A direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor can be used for the treatment of such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as tumor vascularization.  For example, it is known that by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF, the growth of tumors can be inhibited.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the VEGF factor via its receptor.  So that VEFG can exert this action, it is<br><br>
necessary that VEGF bonds to the receptor and a tyrosine phosphorylation is brought about.<br>
Phenyl-anthranilamide derivatives are already known that are used as angiotensin II-antagonists (EP 564 356) and as antiinflammatory agents and anti-ulcera compounds (U.S. 3,409,668).<br>
It has now been found that compounds of general formula I<br><br><br><br><br>
in which A W<br><br>
stands for the group =NR2,<br>
stands for oxygen, sulfur, two hydrogen<br>
atoms or the group =NR8,<br>
stands for the group =NR10 or =N-,<br>
-N(R10) - (CH2) -, branched or unbranched<br>
C1-6 alkyl or the group<br><br><br><br>
or A, Z and R1 together form the group<br><br>
m, n and o        stand for 0-3,<br>
q	stands for 1-6,<br>
R , Rb, Rc, Rd, R , Rf, independently of one another, stand<br>
for hydrogen, C1.4 alkyl or the group =NR10, and/or R and/or Rb can form a bond with Rc and/or Rd or Rc can form a<br>
bond with Re and/or Rf, or up to two of<br>
radicals Ra-Rf can close a bridge with<br>
up to 3 C-atoms each to form R1 or R2,<br>
X	stands for the group =NR9 or =N-,<br>
Y	stands for the group -(CH2)p/<br>
p	stands for 1-4,<br>
R1	stands for C1_6 alkyl that is<br>
unsubstituted or is optionally substituted in one or more places with<br><br>
halogen, C1-6 alkyl, in one or more places with halogen, or aryl or heteroaryl that is substituted with C1-6 alkoxy, with the exception of compounds in which aryl is bonded right in the =NR2 group in the meaning of A,<br>
R2	stands for hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl or<br>
forms a bridge with up to 3 ring members with Ra-Rf from Z or to form Rv<br>
R3	stands for monocyclic or bicyclic aryl<br>
or heteroaryl that is unsubstituted or optionally substituted in one or more places with halogen, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy or hydroxy,<br>
R4, R5, R6, and R7, independently of one another, stand for<br>
hydrogen, halogen, or C1-6 alkoxy, C1-6 alkyl or C1-6 carboxylalkyl that is unsubstituted or optionally substituted in one or more places with halogen, or R5 and R6 together form the group<br>
0<br>
  CH2 0<br>
R8, R9, and R10, independently of one another, stand for<br>
hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl,<br>
as well as their isomers and salts, stop a tyrosine phosphorylation or persistent<br><br>
angiogenesis and thus prevent the growth<br><br>
and propagation of tumors. If R2 forms a bridge to R1, heterocycles are produced to which R1 is fused.  For example, there can be mentioned:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
If Ra, Rfa, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf/ independently of one another, represent hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, Z forms an alkyl chain.<br><br>
If Ra and/or Rb form a bond with Rc and/or Rd or Rc and/or Rd form a bond with Re and/or Rf, Z stands for an alkenyl or alkinyl chain.<br>
If Ra-Rf form a bridge on their own, Z represents a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group.<br>
If up to two of radicals Rg-Rf form a bridge with up to 3 C atoms to R1, Z together with R1 is a benzo- or hetaryl-condensed (Ar) cycloalkyl.<br>
For example, there can be mentioned:<br><br><br>
If one of radicals Rg-Rf closes a bridge to form R2, a nitrogen heterocycle that can be separated from R1 by a group is formed.<br>
For example, there can be mentioned:<br><br>
Alkyl is defined in each case as a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl or hexyl, whereby C1-4 alkyl radicals are preferred.<br>
Cycloalkyl is defined respectively as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl.<br><br>
Cycloalkenyl is defined respectively as cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl, whereby the linkage can take place both to the double bond and to the single bonds.<br>
Halogen is defined respectively as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The alkenyl and alkinyl substituents are in each case straight-chain or branched and contain 2-6 C atoms, preferably 2-4 C atoms.  For example, the following radicals can be mentioned: vinyl, propen-1-yl, propen-2-yl, but-1-en-l-yl, but-l-en-2-yl, but-2-en-i-yl, but-2-en-2-yl, 2-methyl-prop-2-en-l-yl,- 2-methyl-prop-1-en-l-yl, but-l-en-3-yl, ethinyl, prop-1-in-l-yl, but-l-in-1-yl, but-2-in-l-yl, but-3-en-l-yl, allyl.<br>
In each case, the aryl radical has 6-12 carbon atoms, such as, for example, naphthyl, biphenyl and especially phenyl.<br>
In each case, the heteroaryl radical can be benzocondensed. For example, there can be mentioned as 5-ring heteroaromatic compounds:  thiophene, furan, oxazole, thiazole, imidazole, pyrazole and benzo derivatives thereof, and as 6-ring-heteroaromatic compounds pyridine, pyrimidine, triazine, quinoline, isoquinoline and benzo derivatives, whereby in the case of benzocondensed heteroaryl radicals, the binding can be both to the heterocycle and to the benzo ring.<br>
In each case, the aryl radical and the heteroaryl radical can be substituted by the same or a different component in 1, 2 or 3 places with halogen, C1-4 alkoxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, SOqR5 or C1-4 alkyl, whereby q stands for 0-2.<br><br>
If an acid group is included, the physiologically compatible salts of organic and inorganic bases are suitable as salts, such as, for example, the readily soluble alkali and alkaline-earth salts as well as N-methyl-glucamine, dimethyl glucamine, ethyl glucamine, lysine, 1,6-hexadiamine, ethanolamine, glucosamine, sarcosine, serinol, tris-hydroxy-methyl-amino-methane, aminopropanediol, Sovak base, l-amino-2,3,4-butanetriol.<br>

The compounds according to the invention prevent a<br>
phosphorylation, i.e., certain tyrosine kinases can be inhibited<br>
selectively, whereby the persistent angiogenesis can be stopped.<br>
Thus, for example, the growth and the propagation of tumors is<br>
suppressed.<br>
The compounds of general formula I according to the<br>
invention also include the possible tautomeric forms and comprise<br><br>
the E- or Z-isomers, or, if a chiral center is present, also the racemates and enantiomers.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their physiologically compatible salts can be used based on their inhibitory activity relative to the phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor as a pharmaceutical agent.  Based on their profile of action, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the treatment of diseases that are caused by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Since the compounds of formula I are identified as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases KDR and FLT, they are suitable in particular for treatment of those diseases that are caused by the persistent angiogenesis that is triggered by the VEGF receptor or an increase of vascular permeability.<br>
The subject of this invention is also the use of compounds according to the invention as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases KDR and FLT.<br>
The subjects of this invention are thus also pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of tumors.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used either alone or in a formulation as pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of psoriasis, arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma, eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy, fibrotic diseases, such as<br><br>
cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial-cell-proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis and injuries to the nerve tissue.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents.<br>
In the treatment of injuries to the nerve tissue, a quick scar formation at the injury sites can be prevented with the compounds according to the invention, i.e., scars are prevented from forming before the axons are reconnected to one another. Reconstruction of the nerve connections thus would be facilitated.<br>
The ascites formation in patients also can be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention.  The VEGF-induced edemas can also be suppressed.<br>
Such pharmaceutical agents, their formulations and uses are also the subject of this invention.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of general formula I, for the production of a pharmaceutical agent for treatment of tumors, psoriasis, arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma, eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy, fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial-cell-proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to the nerve tissue, inhibition of the<br><br>
reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents.<br>
To use the compounds of formula I as pharmaceutical agents, the latter are brought into the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which in addition to the active ingredient for enteral or parenteral administration contains suitable pharmaceutical, organic or inorganic inert support media, such as, for example, water, gelatin, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, etc.  The pharmaceutical preparations can be present in solid form, for example as tablets, coated tablets, suppositories, capsules or in liquid form, for example as solutions, suspensions or emulsions.  Moreover, they optionally contain adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers.<br>
For parenteral use, in particular injection solutions or suspensions, especially aqueous solutions of the active compounds in polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, are suitable.<br>
As vehicle systems, surface-active adjuvants, such as salts of bile acids or animal or plant phospholipids, but also mixtures thereof as well as liposomes or components thereof can also be used.<br>
For oral use, especially tablets, coated tablets or capsules with talc and/or hydrocarbon vehicles or binders, such as, for example, lactose, corn or potato starch, are suitable.  The<br><br>
application can also be carried out in liquid form, such as, for example, as juice, to which optionally a sweetener is added.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredients can vary depending on the method of administration, age and weight of the patient, type and severity of the disease that is to be treated, and similar factors.  The daily dose is 0.5-1000 mg, preferably 50-200 mg, whereby the dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or subdivided into 2 or more daily doses.<br>
The above-described formulations and forms for dispensing are also the subject of this invention.<br>
The production of the compounds according to the invention is carried out according to methods that are known in the art. For example, compounds of formula I are obtained in that<br>
a)   A compound of formula II<br><br>
in which R4 to R7 have the above meaning and T is H or a protective group and A is halogen or OR13, whereby R13 means a hydrogen atom, C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 acyl, or a ring connects with T, first alkylates N and then converts COA into an amide and then<br><br>
optionally protective groups are cleaved or first converted into the amide and then N-alkylated, or<br>
b)	A compound of formula III<br>
in which R4 to R7 have the above meaning and T means H or a protective group, is in orthometallated form, and then is converted into an amide by being caught with an electrophile, then the protective group is cleaved, and the amino group is alkylated, or<br>
c)	A compound of formula IV<br>
in which R4 to R7 have the above meaning, and T means H or a protective group and B means halogen or O-filtrate, O-tosylate or O-mesylate, is converted into an amide, then the protective group is cleaved off, and the amino group is alkylated.<br>
The sequence of the steps can be reversed in all three cases.<br>
The amide formation is carried out according to methods that are known in the literature.<br>
For amide formation, a start can be made from a corresponding ester.  The ester is reacted according to J. Org. Chem. 1995, 8414 with aluminum trimethyl and the corresponding amine in solvents, such as toluene, at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent.  This method can also be used in unprotected anthranilic acid esters.  If the molecule contains two ester groups, both are converted into the same amide.<br>
When nitriles are used instead of ester, amidines are obtained under analogous conditions.<br><br>
For amide formation, however, all processes that are known from peptide chemistry are also available.  For example, the corresponding acid can be reacted in aprotic polar solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide on an activated acid derivative, that can be obtained, for example, with hydroxybenzotriazole and a carbodiimide such as, for example, diisopropylcarbodiimide or else with preformed reagents, such as, for example, HATU (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201) or BTU, at temperatures of between 0°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 8 0°C with the amine at HATU preferably at room temperature. These methods can also be used in the unprotected anthranilic acids.  For amide formation, the process can also be used on the mixed acid anhydride, imidazolide or azide.  A prior protection of the amino group, for example as amide, is not necessary in all cases, but can affect the reaction advantageously.  Isatoic acid anhydrides, in which the protection of the amino group and the activation of the acidic function are present at the same time, are a special starting material.<br>
If the amine is already converted into the BOC-protected compound, the ortho-position can be metallated by reaction with organometallic compounds, such as, for example, n-butyllithium, and then caught with isocyanates or isothiocyanates to form the anthranilamides or anthranilthioamides.  A bromine or iodine substituent in this ortho-position facilitates the ortho-metallation by halogen-metal exchange.  As solvents, ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or hydrocarbon such as hexane, but also mixtures thereof, are suitable.  The addition of<br><br>
variant in aqueous solution at weakly alkaline pH or by reaction<br><br>
with an anhydride in glacial acetic acid.<br>
The introduction of the halogens chlorine, bromine, iodine or the azido group via an amino group can also be carried out, for example, according to Sandmeyer, by the diazonium salts that are formed as intermediate products with nitrites being reacted with copper(I) chloride or copper(I) bromide in the presence of the corresponding acid such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid or with potassium iodide.<br>
If an organic nitrite is used, the halogens can be introduced into a solvent, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, e.g., by addition of methylene iodide or tetrabromomethane.  The removal of the amino group can be achieved either by reaction with an organic nitrite in tetrahydrofuran or by diazotization and reductive boiling down of the diazonium salt with, for example, phosphorous acid optionally with the addition of copper(I) oxide.<br>
The introduction of fluorine can be carried out by, for example, Balz-Schiemann reaction of the diazonium tetrafluoroborate or according to J. Fluor. Chem. 76, 1996, 59-62 by diazotization in the presence of HFxpyridine and subsequent boiling-down optionally in the presence of a fluoride ion source, such as, e.g., tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
The introduction of the azido group can be carried out after diazotization by reaction with sodium azide at room temperature.<br>
Ether cleavages are performed according to processes that are common in the literature.  In this case, a selective cleavage<br><br>

Especially valuable are those intermediate products of general formula V in which<br>
A and W	stand for oxygen,<br>
Z and R'	together form a =C=0 group that is<br>
bonded to X,<br>
X	stands for the group s=NR9 or =N-,<br>

methoxy or trifluoroethyl,<br>
R4 and R7	stand for hydrogen,<br>
R9	stands for hydrogen,<br>
as well as their isomers and salts.<br>
The intermediate products are partially active on their own and can thus also be used for the production of a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of tumors, psoriasis, arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma, eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy, fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial-cell-proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to the nerve tissue, inhibition of the<br><br>
According to commonly used methods, such as, for example, crystallization, chromatography or salt formation, the isomer mixtures can be separated into enantiomers or E/Z-isomers.<br>
The production of the salts is carried out in the usual way, by a solution of the compound of formula I being mixed with the equivalent amount or an excess of a base or acid, which optionally is in solution, and the precipitate being separated or the solution being worked up in the usual way.<br>
If the production of the starting compounds is not described, the latter are known or can be produced analogously to known compounds or processes that are described here.<br>
Also subjects of this invention are the isatoic acid derivatives of general formula V<br><br>

in which R3-R7, X, Y and W have the meanings that are described in general formula I and in which A stands for the group =NR2 or oxygen, and Z and R1 together form a =C=0 group that is bonded to X, as well as their isomers and salts, as valuable intermediate<br><br>
reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents.<br><br>
can be achieved also in several groups that are present in the molecule.  In this case, the ether is treated with, for example, boron tribromide in solvents such as dichloromethane at temperatures of between -100°C up to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at -78°C.  It is also possible, however, to cleave the ether by sodium thiomethylate in solvents such as dimethylformamide.  The temperature can lie between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 150°C.<br>
The N- or O-alkylation of amides such as the pyrid-2-one or 2-hydroxypyridine can be carried out according to methods that are known in the literature.  An N-alkylation thus can be achieved with bases such as sodium hydride or potassium carbonate in solvents such as dimethylformamide and alkylation with alkyl halides such as methyl iodide.  An O-alkylation with bases such as silver carbonate in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or toluene or preferably mixtures thereof with alkyl halides, such as methyl iodide.  An O-alkylation is also obtained during conversion with trialkyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in inert solvents such as methylene chloride.  Mixtures of N- and O-alkyl derivatives are obtained in the reaction with diazomethane or trimethylsilyldiazomethane in solvents such as methanol or toluene, preferably in mixtures thereof at temperatures up to the boiling point of the solvent, but preferably at room temperature. The methods make possible a selective alkylation of the pyridone relative to the benzoic acid amide.<br><br>
