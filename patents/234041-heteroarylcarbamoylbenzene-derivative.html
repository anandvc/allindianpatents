				<td>The present invention relates to heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivatives<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to glucokinase activators comprising heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivatives as active ingredients. The invention further relates to novel heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivatives.<br>
Background Art<br>
Glucokinase (GK) (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.1) is one of the four types of mammalian hexokinases (hexokinase IV). Hexokinases are enzymes in the first step of the glycolysis pathway which catalyze the reaction from glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Expression of glucokinase is largely localized in the liver and pancreatic beta cells, and it plays an important role in glucose metabolism throughout the body by controlling the rate limiting step of glucose metabolism in these cells. The glucokinase types expressed in the liver and pancreatic beta cells differ in the sequence of the 15 N-terminal amino acids due to a difference in splicing, but their enzymatic properties are identical. The enzyme activities of the three hexokinases (I, II, III) other than glucokinase become saturated at a glucose concentration of below 1 mM, whereas the Km of glucokinase for glucose is 8 mM, or close to the physiological glucose level. Thus, glucokinase-mediated intracellular glucose metabolism is accelerated in response to glucose level changes by postprandial glucose level increase (10-15 mM) from normal glucose (5 mM).<br>
The theory that glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor for pancreatic beta cells and the liver has been advocated for about 10 years (for example, Garfinkel D. et al., Computer modeling identifies glucokinase as glucose sensor of pancreatic beta cells, American Journal Physiology, Vol. 247 (3Pt2)1984, p527-536).<br>
Recent results in glucokinase gene-manipulated mice have confirmed that glucokinase does in fact play an important role in systemic glucose homeostasis. Mice lacking a functional glucokinase gene die shortly after birth (for example, Grupe A. et al,<br><br><br>
Transgenic knockouts reveal a critical requirement for pancreatic beta cell glucokinase in maintaining glucose homeostasis, Cell, Vol. 83, 1995, p69-78), while healthy and diabetic mice overexpressing glucokinase have lower blood glucose levels (for example, Ferre T. et al., Correction of diabetic alterations by glucokinase, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A., Vol. 93, 1996, p7225-7230). With glucose level increase, the reactions of pancreatic beta cells and the liver, while differing, both act toward lowering blood glucose. Pancreatic beta cells secrete more insulin, while the liver takes up glucose and stores it as glycogen while also reducing glucose release.<br>
Such variation in glucokinase enzyme activity is important for liver and pancreatic beta cell-mediated glucose homeostasis in mammals. A mutant form of the glucokinase gene is expressed in a type of diabetes which occurs in youth, known as MODY2 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and the reduced glucokinase activity has been shown to be responsible for blood glucose increase (for example, Vionnet N. et al., Nonsense mutation in the glucokinase gene causes early-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Nature Genetics, Vol. 356, 1992, p721-722).<br>
On the other hand, families have been found having a mutation which increases glucokinase activity, and such individuals exhibit hypoglycemic symptoms (for example, Glaser B. et al., Familial hyperinsulinism caused by an activating glucokinase mutation, New England Journal Medicine, Vol. 338, 1998, p226-230).<br>
This suggests that in humans as well, glucokinase functions as a glucose sensor and thus plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Glucose regulation utilizing a glucokinase sensor system should be possible to achieve in type II diabetic patients. Since glucokinase activators should have effects of accelerating insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and of promoting glucose uptake and inhibiting glucose release by the liver, they are potentially useful as therapeutic agents for type II diabetic patients.<br>
In recent years it has been demonstrated that pancreatic beta cell glucokinase is expressed locally in rat brain, and particularly in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Approximately 20% of VMH neurons are known as "glucose-responsive neurons", and<br><br><br>
these have long been considered to play an important role in body weight control. Administration of glucose into rat brain reduces feeding consumption, but inhibiting glucose metabolism by intracerebral administration of the glucose analog glucosamine produces hyperphagia. Electrophysiological experiments have indicated that glucose-responsive neurons are activated in response to physiological glucose level changes (5-20 mM) but that their activation is inhibited with glucose metabolism inhibition by glucosamine or the like. The glucose level-detecting system in the VMH is believed to be based on a glucokinase-mediated mechanism similar to that for insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Consequently, substances which activate glucokinase in the VMH in addition to pancreatic beta cells not only exhibit a glucose rectifying effect but can also potentially rectify obesity, which is a problem for most type II diabetic patients.<br>
This indicates that compounds having glucokinase-activating effects are useful as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diabetes, as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diabetes complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, ischemic cardiopathy, arteriosclerosis and the like, and as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for obesity.<br>
The compound represented by the following formula (IV), having substituents at the 3- and 5-positions of the same benzene ring as the heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivatives (I) of the invention, has been described.<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
This   compound  has   ter/-butyl   groups   at  both   the   3-   and   5-positions   of  the heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene ring, and does not have alkyl groups at the 3- and 5-<br><br>
positions as according to the compounds of the invention. It also has imidazo-[l,2-a]pyridine bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, but the relative positional relationship between the N of the pyridine ring of the imidazo-[l,2-a]pyridyl group and the carbamoyl group differs from the relative positional relationship between the carbamoyl group and the nitrogen atom of the heteroaryl group in the compounds of the invention (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication of International Application No. 11-505524).<br>
The compound represented by the following formula (V), having two substituents on the benzene ring of a heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivative, has also been described (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication of International Application No. 2001-526255).<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
Although the compound described in the aforementioned Patent document 2 partially matches the structure of the compounds of the invention in that one of the two substituents is trifluoromethylphenylamino, trifluoromethylphenylamino being included in the X'-(Ring A)-R' of the compounds of the invention, and in that it contains a pyridine ring as the group bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, in the compounds of the invention the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group is adjacent to the carbon atom of the pyridine ring which is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, whereas the compound described in the aforementioned Patent document 2 differs in that the nitrogen atom is bonded via another carbon atom lying between it and the carbon atom of the pyridine ring which is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, and also in that the bonding<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
position of the methoxy group is different from the bonding position of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compound represented by the following formula (VI) has also been described (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication of International Application No. 2002-509536).<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Although the compound described in the aforementioned Patent document 3 matches the structure of the compounds of the invention in that one of the two substituents on the benzene ring is 2-methyl-4-iodo-phenylamino and in that a nitrogen atom is adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, it differs in that the positional relationship between the 2-methyl-4-iodo-phenylamino group and the carbamoyl group is different from the positional relationship in the compounds of the invention, and in that it has a fluoro group as the other of the two substituents on the benzene ring while the compounds of the invention contain no halogen atoms as substituents on the benzene ring.<br>

The heteroarylcarbamoylbenzene derivatives of the present invention may also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such salts may be acid addition salts or base addition salts.<br>
Depending on the manner of the substituents, the compounds of the invention may also exist as stereoisomers or tautomers, including optical isomers, diastereomers and geometric isomers.

Since the compounds of the invention have glucokinase-activating effects, they are useful as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diabetes, and also as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diabetes complications.<br>
Here, "diabetes complications" refers to conditions which occur in association with diabetes, and examples of such diabetes complications include diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy and diabetic arteriosclerosis.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be applied for either insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<br>
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is considered to be caused by reduction in insulin secretion and insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle due to genetic factors, while non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is considered to be predominantly an adult onset form, with increasing insulin resistance associated with obesity. Diabetes is therefore classified as type I (IDDM) or type II (NIDDM), depending on the cause.<br>
The compounds of the invention are believed to be useful not only for type I diabetes, but also for type II diabetes for which adequate blood glucose level reduction has not been possible using conventional diabetes drugs.<br>
In type II diabetes, the degree of postprandial hyperglycemia continues for a notably more prolonged period than in healthy persons, and the compounds of the invention are also useful against this type II diabetes.<br>

amount of each active ingredient. For example, in the case of a combination of a<br>
compound of formula (I) with a PPAR agonist, the weight ratio of the compound of<br>
formula (I) with respect to the PPAR agonist will generally be from about 1000:1 to<br>
1:1000, and preferably from about 200:1 to 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the<br>
formula (I) and other active ingredients will also be within the aforementioned range, but<br>
in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.	The<br>
glucokinase activating power of the compounds represented by compound (I) of the present invention, and the test methods used, will now be explained.<br>
The excellent glucokinase activating function of the compounds represented by formula (I) above may be measured by a method described in the relevant literature (for example, Diabetes, Vol. 45, pp. 1671-1677, 1996) or by a corresponding method.<br>
The glucokinase activity is the degree of activation of glucokinase, as determined not by direct measurement of glucose-6-phosphate, but by measurement of the amount of thio-NADH produced upon production of phosphogluconolactone from glucose-6-phosphate by the reporter enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.<br>
The recombinant human liver GK used in this assay was expressed in E. coli as FLAG fusion protein, and it was purified by ANTIFLAG M2 AFFINITY GEL (Sigma).<br>
The assay was carried out using a flat-bottomed 96-well plate at 30°C. A 69 ul portion of assay buffer (25 mM Hepes Buffer: pH = 7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TNAD, 1 mM dithiothreitol) was dispensed, and either a DMSO solution of the compound or 1 ul of DMSO as a control was added. Next, 20 ul of an enzyme mixture (FLAG-GK, 20 U/ml G6PDH) precooled in ice bath was dispensed, and then 10 ul of 25 mM glucose was added as substrate and reaction was initiated (final glucose concentration = 2.5 mM).<br>
After initiation of the reaction, the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured every 30 seconds during a 10 minute period, and the increase during the first 5 minutes was used to evaluate the compound.    FLAG-GK was added to produce an<br><br>
absorbance increment of from 0.05 to 0.1 after 5 minutes in the presence of 1% DMSO.<br>
The OD values were measured at each concentration of the evaluated compound, using the OD value of the DMSO control as 100%. The Emax (%) and EC50 (uM) values were calculated from the OD value at each concentration, and used as indices of the GK activating power of the compounds.<br>
The GK activating power of the compounds of the invention were measured by this method.    The results are shown in Table 1 below. (Table 5)<br>

The conversion reaction may be carried out by the method described in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Richard C. Larock, 2nd printing, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999), a corresponding metliod, or a combination thereof with an ordinary method.<br>
The reaction between the 3-(2-amino-l-methyl-ethoxy)-5- (4-methanesulfonyl -phenoxy)-N-thiazol-2-yl-benzamide and acetic acid is an amide bond-forming reaction, and it may be carried out by the same method as the amide bond-forming reaction used in Step 1 or another step, a corresponding method, or a combination thereof with an ordinary method.<br>
