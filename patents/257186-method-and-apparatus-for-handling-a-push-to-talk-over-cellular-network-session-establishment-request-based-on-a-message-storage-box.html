				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the field of mobile communication and specifically to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications that uses network based storage. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for handling of Network Push to talk over Cellular (NW PoC) box full case and missed session information.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the current scenario, IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) based applications like Push to talk Over Cellular (PoC) and SIMPLE Information Management (IM) uses Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session control procedures for creating a session. These sessions can be either one to one or group sessions. IMS applications like PoC uses network storage entity to store the session information. As mobile phones have limited storage capacity it is always beneficial for a user to store the information in the network storage entity. Hence session based applications are always beneficial for the user. If the user who is called is busy, the session information can be stored in the network storage entity without the need for participating in the session itself. Voice mail box services are the best examples of this kind. Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) PoC uses Network PoC (NW PoC) box for storage of session information. The NW PoC box can participate in the PoC session as a normal PoC client. Whenever a user is busy, the call can be diverted to the NW PoC box. The user himself can set rules for diverting the call to NW PoC box automatically.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
In the existing art, if a PoC user is busy, the incoming call is diverted to NW PoC box. The NW PoC box stores the session information in the network so that it can be retrieved by the user later on. In this way, there is no loss of data. But since the network storage capacity is not large enough, if the NW PoC box is full, the NW PoC box refuses an incoming session invitation. Existing methodologies does not provide user with the information, if the NW PoC box is in shortage of storage space. In case of availability of this information the user can retrieve or delete the existing contents in the NW PoC box so that subsequent incoming session invitations will not be blocked. With the existing methods, it is not possible to have information about a session rejected by the PoC box and the reason for rejection of corresponding sessions.<br>
Hence based upon the foregoing there has been felt the need for a method that effectively addresses the above mentioned issues. The present invention has been designed to address these needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a system and method for handling the storage capacity in a Network Push to talk over Cellular (NW PoC) box<br>
It is another object of the present invention to update the user about the session rejected by the NW PoC box.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to store the information of the session missed by a NW PoC box.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and method for managing messages in session based communication applications like PoC and Information Management (IM). According to the said method, a request for a PoC session is sent to a called party. If the called party is busy, the request is directed to a NW PoC box according to the called party's preferences. If the NW PoC box is full, the NW PoC box rejects or redirects the request and sends a notification to the called party indicating that the NW PoC box is full. The NW PoC box sends the notification through a reject response or a redirect request. According to another aspect of the invention, information about sessions missed by the NW PoC box is stored in the NW PoC box or in the PoC server. Further, the information can also be presented to the called party through a request.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for handling of NW PoC box full case comprising the steps of:<br>
sending a request for a session to a called party;<br>
directing the request to a message storage box according to the called party's preferences if the called party is busy;<br>
rejecting or redirecting the request if the message storage box is full; and sending a notification to the called party indicating the status of the message storage box.<br>
The message storage box sends the notification through a reject response or a redirect request. The method further comprising the step of storing information about sessions missed by the message storage box in the message storage box or a server. The method further comprising the step of presenting the information about sessions missed to the called party through a request.<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a system for handling of NW PoC box full case comprising:<br>
means for sending a request for a session to a called party;<br>
means for directing the request to a message storage box according to the<br>
called party's preferences if the called party is busy;<br>
means for rejecting or redirecting the request if the message storage box is<br>
full; and<br>
means for sending a notification to the called party indicating the status of the message storage box.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description is not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for handling circumstances when the Network Push to talk Over Cellular (NW PoC) box is full. Further, the invention also provides a method for storing the missed session information by storing information about the session missed by the NW PoC box.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the basic PoC call flow using NW PoC box. The PoC user sets the user preferences in the PoC server for diverting an incoming call to NW PoC box. From therein, whenever an incoming session invitation comes from a user, the PoC server directly routes the information to NW PoC box. NW PoC box accepts the invitation and participates in the session as a normal PoC box client and stores the session information.<br>
Accordingly, the method proposes a new state attribute that is stored in the NW PoC box. So whenever the NW PoC box is full, it publishes its state to the PoC server. A PoC user can subscribe to this information and get a notification from the PoC server whenever the NW PoC box is full. Figure 2 depicts the sequence of events associated with the NW PoC box publishing its state. It is to be noted that the NW PoC box can also use other attributes like number of messages, size etc for rich user experience. As shown in figure 2,<br>
1.	The NW PoC box A publishes its state to the PoC server. As its state is full, the NW PoC box publishes its state as full by sending a PUBLISH message to the PoC server. In the PUBLISH message, the NW PoC box can add other attributes as well related to its state like number of messages, space filled etc.<br>
2.	The PoC server sends 200 OK responses to NW PoC box A.<br>
3.	PoC user A sends subscribe message to the PoC server to view the state of the NW PoC box A.<br>
4.	The PoC server in turn sends 200 OK responses to PoC user A.<br>
5.	The PoC server sends initial NOTIFY message to PoC user A. In this way, PoC user A gets notifications about the state of the NW PoC box and takes the requisite action.<br>
6.	PoC user B sends INVITE message to PoC user A<br>
7.	As PoC server already knows the state of NW PoC box A it does any one of the following actions<br>
a.	PoC Server sends Reject response to PoC user B<br>
b.	PoC server redirects the invitation to PoC user A<br>
The present invention is explained with reference to an example as follows. Consider that PoC user A has subscribed for getting state information about the NW PoC box for reception of calls. The NW PoC box receives all incoming calls and participates in the PoC call. NW PoC box also publishes its state information to the PoC Server. The NW PoC box sends the following messages to the PoC Server. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
The above example illustrates the notification body format for sending the state of the NW PoC box to the PoC user. The same format can also be used for sending other NW PoC box related state information to the PoC user<br>
Figure 3 depicts the sequence of events associated with the NW PoC box for maintaining the state information. The method according to the present invention proposes a state attribute stored in the NW PoC box which gives the <br>
state of the NW PoC box. A PoC user can subscribe to this state information so that whenever the state of the NW PoC box is full, the NW PoC box sends a notification to the PoC user indicating that the NW PoC box is full. As shown in figure 3,<br>
1.	PoC user A sends subscribe message to NW PoC box A that stores the state information.<br>
2.	NW PoC box A sends 200 OK responses to PoC user A.<br>
3.	NW PoC box A sends initial NOTIFY message to PoC user A. In this way, PoC user A gets notifications about the state of the NW PoC box A.<br>
4.	PoC server sends INVITE request to the NW PoC box A<br>
5.	NW PoC box rejects the request as its state is full<br>
6.	NW PoC box A updates the state information<br>
7.	NW PoC box A sends notify message to PoC user A to indicate that the state of the NW PoC box A is now full<br>
The present invention proposes a method to store missed session information in the PoC server whenever the NW PoC box is enabled. All the incoming invitations are diverted to the NW PoC box. The NW PoC box can reject an incoming session invitation if the NW PoC box is full or if the NW PoC box does not support a particular media or if the NW PoC box is not allowed in the session. Accordingly, the present invention proposes two methods for storing missed session information like session related information and reason for session rejection.<br>
A) Storing missed session information in the NW PoC box<br>
According to this method, the missed session information is stored in the NW PoC box itself in XML format. Whenever an incoming session invitation is rejected by the NW PoC box, the NW PoC box stores session information like initiator, session parameter, session type, time, date and reason for rejecting a session. The PoC user can subscribe for the missed session information stored in NW PoC box and can retrieve it directly from NW PoC box by requesting the same.<br>
Figure 4 depicts the sequence of events involved when the missed session information is stored in the NW PoC box. As shown,<br>
1.	The NW PoC box A stores the missed session information.<br>
2.	PoC user A sends SUBSCIRBE message to NW PoC box A for<br>
retrieving the missed session information. If PoC user A wants to receive continuous notification then PoC user A sends SUBSCRIBE message with specified duration. PoC user A can also retrieve the missed session information from NW PoC box A by sending SUBSCRIBE message with expiry time period 0.<br>
3.	The NW PoC box A sends 200 OK responses to the SUBSCRIBE<br>
message sent by PoC user A.<br>
4. NW PoC box A sends the notification about the missed session information to PoC user A.<br>
B) Storing missed session information in the PoC server<br>
According to this method, when the NW PoC box rejects an incoming session invitation, the missed session information is stored in XML format in the PoC server. The PoC user can subscribe for retrieving the missed session information from the PoC server.<br>
According to an aspect of this method, the PoC user retrieves the missed session information from the PoC server by sending SUBSCRIBE message with expiry time period 0. According to another aspect of this method, the PoC user can also subscribe for continuous notifications for retrieving missed session information from the PoC server.<br>
Figure 5 depicts the sequence of events involved when the missed session information is stored in the PoC server.<br>
1.	PoC user A sends SUBCRIBE message along with appropriate filter to PoC server to retrieve the missed session information<br>
2.	PoC Server sends 200 OK responses to PoC user A.<br>
3.	PoC server sends notify message to PoC user A.<br>
4.	PoC user B wants to establish a session with PoC user A and hence sends a INVITE request to PoC server <br>
5.	PoC server forwards the INVITE request to NW PoC box A of PoC user A<br>
6.	NW PoC box A rejects the session invitation with appropriate reject code<br>
a. PoC server receives the reject response from NW PoC box A, updates the missed session information and checks the filter set by PoC user A<br>
7.	PoC server sends a notification for the missed session information to PoC user A.<br>
The notification body contains the following information about the missed session<br>
i.	Session ID<br>
ii.	Session type <br>
iii.	Initiator<br>
iv.	Other user information<br>
v.	Reject reason<br>
vi.	Optional SDP offered parameters<br>
The above parameters are stored in the missed session information. Session type is used to specify the type of session (for example Ad-Hoc). Initiator specifies the session initiator user name. Reject element is used to specify the reason for rejecting a session invitation. The PoC server can also mention the offered SDP parameters in the INVITE request. This parameter could be optional as per user preference.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
