				<td>The invention relates to a method of manufacturing electrically conducting strips<br>
on a transparent substrate and a transparent substrate thereof, by screen<br>
printing with an electrically conducting paste, and to the transparent substrate<br>
provided with said tracks.<br>
For several years already, It has been known to fit transparent substrates,<br>
especially glazing panels, with conducting tracks which can act as heating<br>
elements or as antenna or alarm elements.<br>
These tracks are generally obtained by the screen-printing method using a paste<br>
contained metallic silver particles. It is known from EP-A-0 712 814 that the<br>
paste has a high stiver content, that is to say from 60 to 90% by weight of the<br>
solid material. Moreover, EP-A-0 079 854 describes a paste, capable of being<br>
deposited by screen printing on glass, which comprises from 45 to 90% by<br>
weight of metallic silver particles with a size less than 1 µm.<br>
The electrically conducting tracks may also be obtained by methods other than<br>
screen printing, for example by extruding a conducting thermosetting paste<br>
directly on the glass in order to form narrow wires (See DE-A-1 796 310).<br>
The electrically conducting tracks which are obtained after baking (which baking<br>
is generally carried out at the same time as treating the glazing panels for<br>
forming and/or toughening purposes) have sufficient mechanical strength. As a<br>
result, the additional galvanizing step, which is tricky to implement because of<br>
the pollution risks associated therewith, is avoided.<br><br>
Glazing panels comprising electrically conducting<br>
tracks are very widespread in the automobile field.<br>
Most often, these tracks are employed as heating<br>
tracks, especially on rear windows, but they can also<br>
be placed on the glazing panel to provide it with an<br>
alarm and/or antenna functions. The aforementioned<br>
documents give no indication with regard to the width<br>
of the electrically conducting tracks thus produced. In<br>
practice, electrically conducting tracks are formed in<br>
industry by conventional screen printing and, after<br>
baking, they have a width of between 0.4 and 1.2 mm and<br>
a thickness which varies according to the nominal<br>
heating power and the ohmic resistance per unit area in<br>
question.<br>
Because of the beneficial functions provided by these<br>
tracks, their number on one and the same glazing panel<br>
has tended to increase over the years, which could pose<br>
problems of overall size and of visibility. Thus, when<br>
the tracks are located in the field of vision of the<br>
glazing panel, they are clearly visible from the<br>
inside, which may bother the driver, and secondarily<br>
from the outside, which is detrimental to the esthetic<br>
appearance of the vehicle.<br>
Moreover, it is already known to use screen-printing<br>
stencils to form varied patterns on the glass (see<br>
DE-A 32 31 382 and DE-A-35 06 891) . Thus it is also<br>
possible to apply the paste in a thicker and/or wider<br>
layer at certain locations of the glass in a single<br>
step (without multiple printing), for example in order<br>
to form busbars for the electric current of the heated<br>
glazing panels. In this way, it is possible for the<br>
temperature over the entire glazed surface to be<br>
adjusted as well as possible, this temperature not<br>
having to exceed 50°C in the region of the busbars<br>
under standard ambient temperature conditions for a<br>
heating power going up to 450 watts. The examples<br>
appearing in the aforementioned patent applications are<br><br>
produced with a d.c. voltage commonly employed for<br>
automobiles, of about 11 to 14 volts.<br>
Heated glazing panels and glazing panels with antenna,<br>
the conducting tracks of which consist of fine tungsten<br>
wires with a diameter of a few micrometers, are also<br>
known. These wires are only present on laminated ' <br>
glazing panels and they are embedded within the<br>
adhesive forming the intermediate sheet since otherwise<br>
it is not possible for them to be fastened safely<br>
directly onto the glass. Since they are finer, these<br>
wires are consequently less visible than the conducting<br>
tracks obtained by screen printing.<br>
There is a requirement by automobile manufacturers,<br>
especially for top-of-the-range vehicles, to have<br>
available glazing panels made of toughened or laminated<br>
safety glass provided with conducting tracks which are<br>
barely visible to the naked eye.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to form conducting<br>
tracks on a transparent substrate which, while being<br>
narrower than the known tracks, are capable of<br>
fulfilling the electrical conduction function which is<br>
assigned to them.<br>
This aim is achieved by the method of the invention<br>
which consists in forming electrically conducting<br>
tracks on the surface of a transparent substrate, by<br>
applying, by screen printing, an electrically<br>
conducting paste forming a predetermined pattern, and<br>
in subjecting said tracks to baking, said method being<br>
characterized in that a thixotropic paste is used,<br>
having a silver content greater than 35% and of which<br>
at least 98?5 of the particles which form it have a size<br>
less than 25 µm, and a screen having at least 90<br>
threads per cm, the width of the narrowest printed<br>
individual electrically conducting track being less<br>
than cr equal to 0.3 mm.<br><br>
To obtain the electrically conducting tracks having the<br>
required width, it has proved to be important to<br>
carefully control all the elements of the method<br>
according to the invention. In this respect, quite<br>
particular attention should be paid to the properties<br>
of the paste, especially the thixotropy and the size of<br>
the particles forming it, and to the screen parameters,<br>
especially the mesh size, the thickness of its coating<br>
and the width of the openings (in this case, slots) to<br>
be provided in said coating which corresponds directly<br>
to the width of the tracks to be printed by screen<br>
printing. By virtue of the invention, it is possible to<br>
mass produce glazing panels fitted with a predetermined<br>
pattern of particularly fine tracks which are barely<br>
visible to the naked eye, on an industrial scale.<br>
The opening of the meshes and also the size of the<br>
openings or of the slots provided in the screen coating<br>
for printing said pattern on the surface of a glazing<br>
panel have a direct effect on the width of said tracks.<br>
Given that the size of the slots corresponds<br>
substantially to the width of the tracks obtained, it<br>
is necessary to form extremely narrow slots (as a<br>
general rule, of about 0.25 mm ± 0.05) in said coating<br>
which itself is relatively thin. Nevertheless, the<br>
width of one of these slots may extend over more than<br>
one single mesh of the screen.<br>
However, it cannot be excluded that there are other<br>
possibilities of producing narrow tracks by another<br>
method using a less thixotropic paste, a coarser screen<br>
(for example consisting of about 70 threads per cm), a<br>
relatively thick screen coating, etc.<br>
In spite of the narrowness of said tracks, which it is<br>
barely possible to detect, a heating power comparable<br>
to that of the normal screen-printed heating tracks or<br>
regions is obtained. Nevertheless, the thickness of the<br><br>
tracks, although increased, is kept within acceptable<br>
limits. The tracks obtained using the method described<br>
herein thus have a maximum thickness on the glass<br>
surface, measured after baking, of about 35 µm, more<br>
generally about 15 to 25 µm, although the thickness of<br>
conventional tracks is about 12 urn. This larger maximum<br>
thickness may be obtained inter alia by virtue of<br>
highly thixotropic pastes used according to the<br>
invention which have the ability to recover their<br>
initial viscosity very quickly after printing on the<br>
glass.<br>
By virtue of the method according to the invention, it<br>
is therefore possible to significantly reduce the width<br>
or the dimensions of the individual electrically<br>
conducting tracks by applying, by printing, a<br>
thixotropic paste containing at least 35% by weight of<br>
silver, having good flow properties for a high shear<br>
rate and containing very small particles, by means of a<br>
particularly fine screen, consisting of threads of a<br>
material known per se, arranged such that the opening<br>
of the mesh is small.<br>
The importance attached to the thixotropic nature of<br>
the paste for the purpose of its application by screen<br>
printing should be specified. During application, the<br>
shear stress to which the paste is subject is high<br>
enough to cause a considerable and sudden drop in the<br>
viscosity which makes it possible for the paste to go<br>
through the orifices of the screen and be deposited on<br>
the substrate thereby forming the pattern of the<br>
tracks. Pastes which are suitable for this purpose are<br>
defined by a ratio of the viscosity in the absence of<br>
shear (starting viscosity) to the viscosity under shear<br>
stress (under screen-printing conditions) which varies<br>
from 50 to 1000 or even more, for example up to 1300-<br>
1500. By way of comparison, this ratio is between 2 and<br>
10 for the normal screen-printing pastes.<br><br>
It is also important that, after deposition on the<br>
substrate, the paste regains a viscosity value as close<br>
as possible to the starting value in a very short time <br>
(recovery time), but also that this value remains<br>
stable over time. In this way, the drawbacks connected<br>
with plastic flow of the paste, in particular an<br>
increase in the width and a decrease in the thickness<br>
of the printed tracks, are avoided, drawbacks which<br>
become greater, the greater the thickness of paste<br>
deposited. In general, a paste whose recovery time is<br>
less than one second, preferably of the order of a few<br>
tenths of a second, should be chosen.<br>
With a paste which is less thixotropic or comprising<br>
coarser particles, it is not possible to obtain<br>
conducting tracks having the indicated width, since the<br>
paste cannot pass through the narrow openings of the<br>
screen. Furthermore, it is not possible either to<br>
envision producing narrow conducting tracks with a<br>
paste whose recovery time (or transition time between<br>
the virtually fluid state under shear and the normal,<br>
practically solid state) is too high to allow the<br>
tracks to remain stable immediately after removing the<br>
screen.<br>
When the silver content of the paste is greater than<br>
50%, the tracks whose width is less than 0.25 mm can be<br>
used as heating tracks, without increasing the<br>
temperature at the nominal permissible power. The<br>
tracks whose silver content is lower, for example of<br>
the order of 35%, are used rather as an alarm and/or an<br>
antenna.<br>
The combined use of a thixotropic paste consisting of<br>
very small-sized particles and of a screen with a fine<br>
mesh makes it possible to print conducting tracks with<br>
excellent resolution. Furthermore, by increasing the<br>
silver content in the thixotropic paste, it is possible<br>
to reduce the final thickness of the tracks.<br><br>
Although particularly suitable for silver-based pastes,<br>
the invention may be extended to pastes containing<br>
metal particles capable of meeting the required<br>
electrical conduction criteria, such as copper or gold<br>
particles.<br>
The glazing panels obtained according to the method of<br>
the invention, although being provided with narrower<br>
tracks, have electrical conduction properties<br>
comparable to those of a glazing panel fitted with<br>
tracks obtained by conventional screen printing, all<br>
other things being equal (number of tracks, distance<br>
between the tracks, arrangement, etc.) . In the case<br>
especially of heated glazing panels, a similar heating<br>
power is attained with the same number of tracks.<br>
To a great extent, the method according to the<br>
invention makes it possible to overcome the<br>
restrictions which mean having to vary the cross<br>
section of the tracks according to where they are<br>
located on the glazing panel. Such a restriction<br>
exists, for example, on trapezoidal-shaped glazing<br>
panels where the tracks located, on the upper part are<br>
shorter than those of the lower part, which requires<br>
adapting the cross section of the tracks so as to<br>
maintain a comparable heating power over the entire<br>
surface of the glass. This restriction is found with<br>
glazing panels where maximum heating power is sought in<br>
the region corresponding to the driver's field of<br>
vision. In this case, the conducting tracks have a<br>
greater width in the vicinity of the side edges than in<br>
the center of the glazing panel. By proceeding under<br>
the conditions of the invention, it is possible to form<br>
tracks of identical width without it resulting in a<br>
noticeable difference in the uniformity of the heating<br>
power. In this respect, there are grounds to think that<br>
; the decrease in the electrical resistance results from<br>
the fact that the paste has a high silver content and<br><br>
that it is deposited over a larger thickness. The<br>
maximum permissible temperature values of the busbars<br>
are broadly respected without there being any need to<br>
apply a large thickness of screen-printing paste with a<br>
high conductivity. Most often, the temperature close to<br>
the busbars is 15% less than the maximum permitted<br>
temperature and does not exceed 50°C, under standard<br>
ambient temperature conditions, for a nominal power not<br>
exceeding 450 watts for a supply voltage of 11 to<br>
14 volts.<br>
Production on an industrial scale of the glazing panels<br>
obtained according to the method of the invention makes<br>
it possible to save on screen-printing paste, in<br>
particular when the latter is rich in silver (content<br>
greater than or equal to 80%) . This is true for the<br>
production of heating tracks and even more so when it<br>
involves tracks intended to operate as an alarm and/or<br>
antenna.<br>
According to a first preferred embodiment, a<br>
thixotropic paste having a silver content greater than<br>
35%, preferably 50% and even better 70%, the majority<br>
(at least 98%) of whose constituent particles have a<br>
size less than 25 µm, preferably 12 µm, is used<br>
together with a screen-printing screen having at least<br>
90 threads per cm and a coating thickness of at least<br>
30 µm, preferably 50 to 100 µm. This way of operating<br>
makes it possible to deposit on the substrate, by<br>
printing, in a single pass, a thickness of screen-<br>
printing paste which is relatively high compared with<br>
the thicknesses which are usually obtained. The<br>
deposits thus obtained have, after baking, a thickness<br>
 less than 35 µm, more generally of the order of 15 to<br>
25 µm.<br>
The screen employed within the scope of this embodiment<br>
has a coating thickness which is greater (more than<br>
30 µm) than that of the screens with an equivalent<br><br>
number of threads used for the intended application<br>
(generally less than 10 µm) . This screen can be<br>
obtained by photographic technology, known per se,<br>
which consists in covering the surface of the screen<br>
with a layer or a film of photocrosslinkable resin and<br>
in operating by projecting a slide in order to<br>
reproduce the printing pattern on the screen. In the<br>
present case, a presensitized photocrosslinkable resin<br>
is used, which is capable of forming a coating which is<br>
solid enough to withstand the action of the screen-<br>
printing doctor blade, in a very short time, of the<br>
order of 150 seconds or even less. By way of<br>
comparison, with a conventional photocrosslinkable<br>
resin, it is necessary to have a high irradiation time,<br>
of the order of 5 to 6 minutes in order to obtain<br>
crosslinking throughout the thickness of the coating.<br>
The term "presensitized photocrosslinkable resin"<br>
refers in this case to a precrosslinked resin which<br>
comprises one or more polymers of low molecular weight<br>
capable of reacting under the effect of light in order<br>
to form a crosslinked network The presensitized<br>
photocrosslinkable resin can especially be used in the<br>
form of a layer of emulsion deposited directly on the<br>
screen or of a film supporting said resin, this film<br>
being moistened before being applied to the surface of<br>
the screen. By limiting the irradiation duration, it is<br>
thus possible to prevent unwanted light effects close<br>
to the edges of the printing mask, light which causes<br>
undesirable crosslinking of the resin. This results in<br>
a reduction in the size of the printed pattern with<br>
respect to that of the mask, on the face subjected to<br>
the irradiation, which then results, during screen<br>
printing, in reducing the amount of paste deposited on<br>
the substrate and in poorer resolution in the printing<br>
of the tracks.<br>
It is advantageous to choose a screen whose edges,<br>
corresponding to the printing patterns, are<br>
substantially parallel within the thickness such that<br><br>
the opening designed for the passage of the paste<br>
remains substantially constant from one face to the<br>
other of the screen. In any case, it is desirable that<br>
the variation of the opening between both faces of the<br>
screen, for the same pattern, is less than 20%, and<br>
preferably 10%. By way of comparison, with the<br>
previously mentioned conventional photocrosslinkable<br>
resin, the high irradiation time needed for the<br>
crosslinking does not allow the desired opening<br>
corresponding to the printed pattern to be obtained<br>
(reduction of the opening or even complete blockage).<br>
The type of thread forming the screen is not critical.<br>
Preferably, the threads are made of polyester and each<br>
thread consists of a single (monofilament) thread with<br>
a diameter of between 30 and 60 µm, preferably 40 and<br>
50 µm.<br>
The doctor blade, which allows the paste to be pressed<br>
through the screen-printing screen, may be a normal<br>
doctor blade having a right-angled printing edge, which<br>
is chamfered or rounded. The use of the latter type of<br>
doctor blade makes it possible to obtain some increase<br>
in the shear stress, hence a reduction in the viscosity<br>
of the paste during passage through the screen.<br>
Preferably, the doctor blade consists of a material of<br>
the polymer type, for example a polyurethane, having a<br>
Shore A hardness of between 65 and 85.<br>
By virtue of the invention, it is possible to obtain<br>
conducting tracks having a surface resistance less than<br>
2.5 mohm per square for a thickness of 10 µm after<br>
baking, which corresponds to a resistivity less than<br>
2.5 µohm.cm.<br>
Furthermore, the conducting tracks have a satisfactory<br>
abrasion resistance, even where their thickness is<br>
high. This is attributed to the higher densification of<br>
the silver particles in the paste during baking.<br><br>
The manufacture of a heated glazing panel for the<br>
purpose of use as a rear heated window of a motor<br>
vehicle is described below.<br>
Thixotropic screen-printing paste contains 80% silver,<br>
4% glass frit and 16% of a medium which has the<br>
function of facilitating application to the substrate.<br>
All the particles contained in the paste have a size<br>
less than 15 µm. The ratio of the viscosity without<br>
shear stress to the viscosity under shear stress under<br>
screen-printing conditions is equal to 2 00.<br>
The screen consists of a 100 T fabric marketed by SEFAR<br>
which contains 100 threads per cm, each thread<br>
consisting of a single polyester thread having a<br>
diameter of 40 µm, and has a mesh opening equal to<br>
58 µm. The screen is covered with a layer of<br>
presensitized photocrosslinkable emulsion with a<br>
thickness of 80 µm and the pattern corresponding to the<br>
printing mask is reproduced on the screen by<br>
photographic technology (irradiation time: 150 seconds;<br>
blade power: 7 000 W). The edges of the coating for the<br>
patterns reproducing the tracks are parallel, which<br>
means that the opening for the passage of the paste is<br>
constant from one face to the other of the screen.<br>
The screen pattern is printed on a sheet of glass by<br>
means of a right-angled polyurethane doctor blade with<br>
a Snore A hardness of 85. With a printing speed of<br>
20 m/min and an off-contact of 8 mm, tracks are formed<br>
which, after a baking cycle (from ambient temperature<br>
to 650°C in 150 s), have a width of 0.2 to 0.22 mm and<br>
a thickness of 15 µm. The glazing panel fitted with<br>
current busbars has the same performance in terms of<br>
strength and heating power as a glazing panel having an<br>
identical number of conducting tracks, placed in the<br>
same way, obtained by conventional screen printing<br>
(width greater than 0.5 mm).<br><br>
The manufacture of a heated glazing panel according to<br>
another variant of the invention, but also intended for<br>
use as a heated rear window of a motor vehicle, will be<br>
described below.<br>
Although the normal doctor blades have a right-angled<br>
pointed printing edge, with which the paste is printed<br>
through the screen on the surface placed thereunder, it<br>
has proved to be preferable for embodying the invention<br>
to use a modified printing edge of the doctor blade<br>
providing a certain wedge effect. An explanation for<br>
this effect, resulting from chamfering or rounding said<br>
printing edge for this specific configuration, has not<br>
yet been found, but it is possible to assume that there<br>
is a reciprocal effect with the thixotropy - that is to<br>
say the reduction in viscosity on increasing the shear<br>
stress exerted on the thixotropic medium - of the<br>
screen-printing paste.<br>
The rate of printing by the doctor blade is slightly<br>
less compared with the normal methods because of the<br>
need to make the paste pass through the slots or the<br>
openings of considerably smaller cross sections<br>
compared with the cross sections of known screen<br>
coatings. Furthermore, the off-contact of the screen<br>
(that is to say the distance between the freely<br>
tensioned screen and the substrate to be printed, in<br>
this case the glazing panel) is set at 10 mm.<br>
With these materials and dimensions, a resistivity less<br>
than 2.5 µ *cm can be obtained after baking.<br>
The product H 669, from DuPont, is used as a paste, the<br>
viscosity of which is equal to 17 Pa.s (pascal . sec).<br>
It only contains particles of a size less than or equal<br>
to 10 µm. It has a ratio of the viscosity without shear<br>
stress to the viscosity under shear stress under<br>
screen-printing conditions, equal to 100.<br><br>
The screen consists of a 95 T fabric, marketed by<br>
SAATI S.p.A., Italy, which contains 95 threads per cm,<br>
each thread consisting of a single thread made of<br>
polyester having a diameter of 40 µm, and has a mesh<br>
opening equal to 65 µm. The screen is covered with a<br>
layer of presensitized photocrosslinkable emulsion with<br>
a thickness of about 16 µm and the pattern<br>
corresponding to the printing mask is reproduced on the<br>
screen by photographic technology. The edges of the<br>
coating at the patterns reproducing the tracks are<br>
parallel which means that the opening for the passage<br>
of the paste is constant from one face to the other of<br>
the screen. The narrowest of the slots formed in the<br>
coating have a width of about 250 µm.<br>
The screen pattern is printed on a sheet of glass by<br>
means of a polyurethane doctor blade, whose edge is<br>
provided with a bevel at 45° over 0.2 mm and with a<br>
Shore A hardness of 65. With a printing speed of<br>
0.35 m/sec and an off-contact of 10 mm, tracks are<br>
formed which, after a baking cycle (from ambient<br>
temperature to 650°C in 150 s) have a width of 0.2 to<br>
0.22 mm and a thickness of 12-15 µm. The glazing panel<br>
fitted with current busbars has the same performance in<br>
terms of resistance and heating power as a glazing<br>
panel having an identical number of conducting tracks,<br>
arranged in the same way, obtained by conventional<br>
screen printing (width greater than 0.5 mm).<br><br>
