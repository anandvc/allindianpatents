Background of the invention:<br>
Estrogen agonists as well as antagonists elicit biological activity through their binding to estrogen receptor. In case of a chiral ligand, a specific chirality favours receptor binding. Thus, d-estradiol shows many fold higher affinity towards estrogen receptor binding as compared to 1-estradiol. In the case of trans-3,4-diaryl chromans of structure 1, 3R, 4R- trans- chroman wherein RI= 7-OMe; R2=Me; R3=Me, Rt and RS = H shows 7 fold higher affinity for ER binding as compared to the 3S, 4S- form and also elicits similar order of anti-implantation activity (JMC.29, 1801-1803). It is also possible that the different enantiomers may show different biological activities and also pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, use of single enantiomeric forms as pharmaceutical is recommended.<br>
In order to develop enantiomers of trans-3,4-diaryl chromans Figure I substituted with various amino alkoxy side chain, which is known to play a major role in deciding their antiestrogenic activities and towards development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), it was therefore, necessary to synthesize hydroxy derivatives of (3R, 4R) and (3S, 4S) enantiomers of trans-3, 4-diaryl chromans 2 which would serve as intermediate for the preparation of aminoalkoxy side chain substituted final products.<br>
The object of the present investigation was therefore to develop a process for the preparation of trans-3S, 4S 3-aryl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)- substituted chromans 2, which would serve as the key intermediate for the preparation of 3S, 4S- trans-3,4-diaryl substituted chromans variously substituted with substituted amino alkyl groups on the 4-phenyl residue.<br>
The final compounds thus obtained show selective cholesterol lowering activity.<br><br>
