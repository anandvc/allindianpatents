				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The present invention relates to an improved catalytic oxygenate to propylene (OTP) process that uses a combination of dual-function catalyst technology and selective hydrotreating of one or more heavy olefin recycle streams to hold average cycle catalytic activity and propylene selectivity nearer to the start of cycle levels during the entire on-stream cycle time, thereby sharply improving the average propylene yield achieved by the catalyst over its life cycle relative to that achievable with the same or similar dual-function catalyst in a heavy olefm recycle system that does not employ the selective hydrotreating step. The present invention recognizes that propylene selectivity achievable over dual-function OTP catalyst systems known in the art operating in heavy olefin recycle mode is very sensitive to deactivation by coke deposition and by hydrothermal dealumination (accelerated by exposure to high temperatures in the presence of steam which temperatures are needed both in the OTP reaction step and in the OTP catalyst regeneration step to compensate for the activity loss caused by this excessive coke deposition) and recognition that coke precursors such as dienes, acetylenic hydrocarbons and other highly unsaturated hydrocarbons are concentrated in this heavy olefin recycle stream. Accordingly the propylene selectivity in an OTP catalytic process operating with a dual-function catalyst and in heavy olefin recycle mode can be continuously maintained at or near start-of-run levels if selective hydrogenation treatment technology of the heavy olefin recycle stream is used to minimize and control detrimental coke deposition on the dual-function OTP catalyst system. [0002]       A major portion of the worldwide petrochemical industry is concerned with the production of light olefin materials and their subsequent use in the production of numerous important chemical products via polymerization, oligomerization, alkylation and the like well-known chemical reactions. Light olefins include ethylene, propylene and mixtures thereof. The art has long sought a source other than petroleum for the massive quantities of raw materials that are needed to supply the demand for these light olefin materials. Oxygenates are particularly attractive alternate source because they can be produced from such widely available materials as coal and natural gas. The art of making methanol and other oxygenates from these types of raw materials is well established. The prior art has revealed essentially two major techniques that are discussed for conversion of methanol to light olefins (MTO). The first of these MTO processes is represented in US-A-4,3 87,263. US-A-4,587,373 discloses the need to operate at a substantial pressure to make the<br><br>
commercial equipment of reasonable size and the diversion of a portion of the methanol feed to the DME absorption zone to downsize the scrubbing zone.<br>
[0003]       To control the amounts of undesired C^+ hydrocarbon products produced by ZSM-5 type of catalyst systems later prior art uses a non-zeolitic molecular sieve catalytic material. US-A-5,095,163; US-A-5,126,308 and US-A-5,191,141 disclose a metal aluminophosphate (ELAPO) and more specifically a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve (SAPO), with a strong preference for SAPO-34.<br>
[0004]       The classical oxygenate to olefm (OTO) technology produces a mixture of light olefins primarily ethylene and propylene along with various higher boiling olefins. Although the classical OTO process technology possesses the capability of shifting the major olefin product recovered therefrom from ethylene to propylene by various adjustments of conditions maintained in the reaction zone, the art has long sought an OTP technology that would provide better yields of propylene relative to the classical OTO technology. [0005]       Publication No. US2003/0139635A1 describes a process for selectively converting methanol to propylene (MTP) and/or converting DME to propylene utilizing three reactors containing fixed beds of a pentasil-type (i.e. ZSM-5 type) oxygenate conversion catalysts in a parallel flow arrangement with respect to the oxygenate feed and a serial flow arrangement with respect to the effluents of the first reactor and the second reactor. Rothaemel et al. describe this MTP process in "Demonstrating the New Methanol to Propylene (MTP) Process" (presented to the ERTC Petrochemical Conference in March of 2003 at Paris, France) as having an expected on-stream portion of the process cycle of 500 to 700 hours before in situ regeneration becomes necessary. The conventional procedure compensates for activity decay in a catalytic operation by increasing the average reactor temperature to hold conversion in the targeted range of greater than 94% of the oxygenate charge.<br>
[0006] t     The problem addressed by the present invention is then to modify this OTP process of the prior art which uses heavy olefin recycle to enhance its average propylene selectivity over its on-stream cycle time and thereby diminish the requirement for recycle of olefin products other than propylene to compensate for lower propylene selectivity. It is recognized that propylene selectivity is a function not only of reaction conditions but also of average coke level deposited on the OTP conversion catalyst during the on-stream portion of the process cycle and that a major source of coke precursors is the heavy olefin recycle stream since it contains detrimental amounts of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons. Thus,<br><br>
average propylene selectivity in an OTP process operated with heavy olefin recycle can be significantly enhanced if the amount of detrimental carbonaceous deposits laid down on the dual-function catalyst during the on-stream portion of the process cycle is controlled by selective hydrogen treatment of at least a portion of the heavy olefin recycle stream to convert highly unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as dienes and acetylenic hydrocarbons, contained therein to the corresponding olefin compounds, thereby eliminating coke precursors. This catalytic hydrotreatment step enables oxygenate conversion and propylene selectivity to be maintained over the process cycle near or at essentially start-of-cycle levels. Quite surprisingly it was found that if selective hydrogen treatment of the heavy olefin recycle stream is used, then the average propylene selectivity over the process cycle will be improved by 1.5% to 5.5% or more, relative to the prior art due to the high level of coke deposition on the catalyst during the latter portion of the on-stream cycle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]       The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a solution to the problem of propylene selectivity loss during the on-stream cycle of the prior art fixed bed OTP process when operated with at least one heavy olefin recycle stream. A secondary objective is to improve the economics of the OTP process by controlling coke deposition on the dual-function catalyst to maintain oxygenate conversion and propylene selectivity at higher levels. Another object of the present invention is to avoid severe deactivation of the dual-function OTP catalyst utilized in this OTP process to minimize the severity of the necessary regeneration step thereby minimizing hydrothermal damage and prolonging catalyst life. A more general objective combines selective hydrogen treatment of at least a portion of heavy olefin recycle stream in such an OTP process with moving bed technology that minimizes attrition losses.<br>
[0008]       In one embodiment the invention is an OTP process for the selective conversion of an oxygenate feed to a propylene utilizing dual-function catalyst technology and selective hydrogen treatment of a heavy olefin recycle stream to maintain catalyst performance near or at essentially start-of-cycle levels, thereby enhancing the average cycle yield of propylene and minimizing oxygenate breakthrough into the product stream. In the first step the process contacts an oxygenate feed and a diluent in an amount corresponding to 0.1:1 to 5:1 moles of diluent per mole of oxygenate with a dual-function catalyst containing a molecular sieve capable of converting at least a portion of the oxygenate to propylene and interconverting €2<br><br>
and C4+ olefms to €3 olefms. This OTP conversion step is performed in an OTP reaction zone containing at least one fixed bed or moving bed reactor which is operated at oxygenate conversion conditions effective to selectively convert oxygenate to propylene and to convert any ethylene or heavy olefms recycled thereto to propylene. An effluent stream is withdrawn from the OTP reaction zone and contains major amounts of a €3 olefin product and a water by-product, lesser amounts of a €2 olefin, €4+ olefms, C \ to C^+ saturated hydrocarbons and minor amounts of unreacted oxygenate, by-product oxygenates, dienes, acetylenic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons. The effluent stream passes to a separation zone for cooling and separation into a vaporous fraction rich in €3 olefins, a water fraction containing unreacted oxygenate and by-product oxygenates and a liquid hydrocarbon fraction containing heavier olefins, heavier saturated hydrocarbons and minor amounts of dienes, acetylenic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons. At least a portion of the water fraction from the separation step is recycled to the oxygenate conversion step to provide at least a portion of the diluent used therein. The vaporous fraction recovered in this separation step is further separated in a second separating zone into a €2 olefin-rich fraction, a €3 olefm-rich product fraction and a C4+ olefm-rich fraction containing highly unsaturated hydrocarbons such as dienes and acetylenic hydrocarbons. The €3 olefin-rich product fraction is recovered as a principal product stream. At least a portion of the C4+olefin-rich fraction is charged to a selective hydrogen treating step. The selective hydrogen treating step selectively converts highly unsaturated compounds contained in this €4+ olefin-rich stream into the corresponding olefin, thereby eliminating coke precursors from the OTP conversion step. This catalytic hydrotreating step contacts at least a portion of this €4+ olefin-rich stream and hydrogen with a metal-containing hydrogenation catalyst at selective hydrogenation conditions effective to convert highly unsaturated hydrocarbons contained therein to the corresponding olefin and to produce a selectively hydrotreated 04+ olefm-rich fraction that is recycled to the OTP conversion step to interconvert these heavier olefinic materials into additional quantities of the desired propylene product.<br>
[0009]       A second embodiment involves a process for the selective conversion of an oxygenate feed to propylene as described in the first embodiment wherein the dual-function catalyst contains a zeolitic molecular sieve having a structure corresponding to ZSM-5 or an ELAPO molecular sieve having a structure corresponding to SAPO-34 or a mixture of these materials.<br><br>
[0010]       Another embodiment comprises a process for selective conversion of an oxygenate feed to propylene as described above in the first embodiment wherein the OTP reaction zone contains at least 3 moving bed reactors which are connected in a serial flow or parallel flow configuration with respect to oxygenate feed and in a serial flow configuration with respect to the stream of catalyst particles that passes therethrough. [0011]       A highly preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a process for the selective conversion of an oxygenate feed to propylene as described above in the first embodiment wherein the oxygenate feed contains methanol or dimethylether or a mixture thereof, hi this embodiment the instant process is referred to herein as a methanol to propylene embodiment (MTP).<br>
[0012]       A high propylene yield embodiment of the instant process involves the process for selective conversion of an oxygenate feed to propylene as described in any of the previous embodiments wherein the liquid hydrocarbon fraction recovered in the first separation step is further separated into a second €4+ olefin-rich fraction and a naphtha product fraction and at least a portion of the resulting C4+ olefin-rich fraction is charged to the selective hydrogen treatment step and thereafter the resulting hydrogen-treated product is recycled to the OTP conversion step to interconvert these heavier olefins into propylene.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]       In the instant OTP process the feedstream comprises one or more oxygenates. The term "oxygenate" is employed herein to include aliphatic alcohols, ethers, and carbonyl compounds (e.g. aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and the like) and mixtures of these materials. The oxygenate feedstock preferably contains at least one oxygen atom and 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and more preferably contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Representatives of suitable oxygenate compounds include methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol, diethyl ether, methylether, formaldehyde, dimethyl ketone, acetic acid, and mixtures thereof. A preferred feedstream contains methanol or dimethylether and mixtures thereof. [0016]       In the OTP conversion step of the present invention, the oxygenate feed is catalytically and selectively converted to propylene and by-product hydrocarbons containing aliphatic moieties such as methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, butylene, butane and limited amounts of other higher carbon number aliphatics by contacting the feedstock with a dual-function OTP catalyst at effective OTP conditions. This OTP conversion step also forms undetermined and minor amounts of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons such as dienes and acetylenic hydrocarbons, and aromatic hydrocarbons. A diluent is not absolutely required but is a useful option to maintain the selectivity of the OTP catalyst to produce light olefins, particularly propylene.<br>
[0017]       A diluent is preferably used in the present invention to control partial pressure of the oxygenate reactant in the OTP conversion zone and to shift the overall reaction selectivity towards propylene. Suitable diluents for use in the present invention include helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, C\ through €5 paraffins,<br><br>
aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures of these materials. Preferred diluents are water, methane, an aromatic compound, and mixtures thereof. An especially preferred diluent is water. The amount of diluent used will be selected from the range of 0.1:1 to 5:1 moles of diluent per mole of oxygenate and preferably 0.5:1 to 2:1 to lower the partial pressure of the oxygenates to a level which favors production of propylene. All embodiments of the present invention envision recycling of at least one of certain heavy olefinic streams. These recycle streams will furnish saturated hydrocarbon diluent to the OTP reaction zone will diminish the target diluent to oxygenate mole ratio once the OTP reaction zone is started up. Where water is the diluent the amount of water charged to the OTP reaction zone during startup will diminish in proportion to the amount of saturated hydrocarbons and other inert materials that are recycled to this reaction zone.<br>
[0018]       The conversion conditions in the OTP reaction zone are carefully chosen to favor the production of propylene from the oxygenate charged in the feed. The art has already established an oxygenate conversion temperature range of 350° to 600°C as effective for the conversion of oxygenate over the known oxygenate conversion catalyst. The lower portion of this oxygenate conversion temperature range favors the production of propylene with the upper portion favoring the production of ethylene at the expense of propylene. Preferred inlet temperatures to the OTP reaction zone are in the range of 350° to 500°C and more preferably in the range of 400°C to 500°C. The temperature increase across each of the OTP reactors is preferably in the range of 10° to 80°C to minimize hydrothermal deactivation and to avoid the acceleration of coke deposition on the catalyst as previously experienced when the temperature of the tail end of the individual reactors was allowed to build to levels beyond those contemplated by the present invention. Numerous methods known for controlling the temperature increase in a reaction zone and most of them utilize multiple beds of catalyst in separate reactors with inner-bed or inter-bed cooling and/or add relatively cool amounts of recycle streams, or portions of the oxygenate feed and/or the diluents that are utilized in the zone. The present invention contemplates the use of lighter and/or heavier olefin interconversion reactions which are known to be mildly endothermic to help control reactor temperature increase to the specified range. Preferably the invention uses at least 3 moving bed reactors with interbed quench through the addition of relatively cool recycle streams to provide additional quantities of reactants and diluent.<br>
[0019]       The oxygenate to propylene conversion step is effectively carried out over a wide range of pressures including inlet total pressures between 0.1 atm (10.1 kPa) up to 100 atm<br><br>
(10.1 MPa) with lower pressure conditions of 1 to 3 ami (101.3 to 304 kPa) and more preferably 136 to 343 kPa (5 to 35 psig) favoring the formation of lighter olefins like propylene.<br>
[0020]       The contact time of the reactants with the dual-function catalyst is ordinarily measured in relative terms of a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) calculated on the basis of a mass hourly flow rate of the sum of the mass of oxygenate reactants passed to the OTP conversion zone plus the mass of any reactive hydrocarbon material present in the feedstream or any of the recycle streams divided by the mass of the dual-function catalyst present in the OTP conversion zone. WHSV in the OTP conversion zone ranges from 0.1 to 100 hr'l, with a preferred range of 0.5 to 20 hr'l, and with best results ordinarily attained in the range of 0.5 to 10 hr1.<br>
[0021]       In the oxygenate to propylene conversion step it is preferred to use a dual-function catalyst having the capability of converting oxygenates to propylene as well as the capability of interconverting olefins other than propylene to propylene. Any known catalytic materials known having the capability to catalyze these two reactions are suitable catalysts for the present invention. The preferred dual-function catalyst contains a molecular sieve as the active ingredient and more specifically the molecular sieve has relatively small pores. The preferred small pore catalysts are defined as having pores at least a portion, preferably a major portion, of which have an average effective diameter characterized such that the adsorption capacity (as measured by the standard McBain-Bakr gravimetric adsorption method using given adsorbate molecules) shows good adsorption of oxygen (average kinetic diameter of 0.346 run) and negligible adsorption of isobutane (average kinetic diameter of 0.5 nm). More preferably the average effective diameter is characterized by good adsorption of xenon (average kinetic diameter of 0.4 nm) and negligible adsorption of isobutane, and most preferably, by good adsorption of n-hexane (average kinetic diameter of 0.43 nm) and negligible adsorption of isobutane. Negligible adsorption of a given adsorbate is adsorption of less than three percent by weight of the catalyst and good adsorption of the adsorbate is over three percent by weight of the adsorbate based on the weight of the catalyst. Certain of the catalysts useful in the present invention have pores with an average effective diameter of less than 5 A. The average effective diameter of the pores of preferred catalysts is determined by measurements described in D. W. Breck, ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVES by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1974). The term "effective diameter" denotes that occasionally the pores are irregularly shaped, e.g., elliptical, and thus the pore dimensions are characterized by the molecules that can be adsorbed rather than<br><br>
the actual dimensions. Preferably, the small pore catalysts have a substantially uniform pore<br>
structure. Suitable dual-function catalysts may be chosen from among zeolitic molecular sieves<br>
and non-zeolitic molecular sieves.<br>
[0022]       Zeolitic molecular sieves in the calcined form may be represented by the general<br>
formula:<br>
where Me is a cation, x has a value from 2 to infinity, n is the cation valence and y has a value of 2 to 100 or more and more typically 2 to 25.<br>
[0023]       Zeolites which may be used include chabazite - also referred to as Zeolite D, clinoptilolite, erionite, ferrierite, mordenite, Zeolite A, Zeolite P, ZSM-5, ZSM-1 1, and MCM-22. Zeolites having a high silica content, (i.e., Those having silica to alumina ratios greater than 10 and typically greater than 100 with best results achieved at a silica to alumina mole ratio of 250:1 to 1000:1 are especially preferred.) One such high silica zeolite having the structure of ZSM-5 is silicalite, as the term used herein includes both the silicapolymorph disclosed in US- A-4,06 1,724 and also the F-silicate disclosed in US-A-4,073,865. [0024]       Non-zeolitic molecular sieves include molecular sieves which have the proper effective pore size and are embraced by an empirical chemical composition, on an anhydrous basis, expressed by the empirical formula:<br>
(ELxAlyPz)02<br>
where EL is an element selected from the group consisting of silicon, magnesium, zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, chromium and mixtures thereof, x is the mole fraction of EL and is at least 0.005, y is the mole fraction of aluminum and is at least 0.01 , z is the mole fraction of phosphorous and is at least 0.01 and x + y + z = 1 . When EL is a mixture of metals, x represents the total amount of the element mixture present. Preferred elements (EL) are silicon, magnesium and cobalt with silicon being especially preferred.<br>
[0025]       The preparation of various ELAPOs may be found in US-A-5,191,141 (ELAPO); US-A-4,554,143 (FeAPO); US-A-4,440,871 (SAPO); US-A-4,853,197 (MAPO, MnAPO, ZnAPO, CoAPO); US-A-4,793,984 (CAPO); US-A-4,752,651 and US-A-4,3 10,440. [0026]       A preferred embodiment of the invention is one in which the element (EL) content varies from 0.005 to 0.05 mole fraction. If EL is more than one element, then the total concentration of all the elements is between 0.005 and 0.05 mole fraction. An especially preferred embodiment is one in which EL is silicon (usually referred to as SAPO). The<br><br>
SAPOs which can be used in the instant invention are any of those described in US-A-4,440,871; US-A-5,126,308, and US-A-5,191,141. SAPO-34 is preferred. [0027]       The preferred OTP conversion catalyst is preferably incorporated into porous solid particles in which the catalyst is present in an amount effective to promote the desired OTP reactions, hi one aspect, the porous solid particles comprise a catalytically effective amount of the molecular sieve catalyst and at least one matrix material, preferably selected from the group consisting of binder materials, filler materials, and mixtures thereof to provide a desired property or properties, e.g., desired catalyst dilution, mechanical strength, and the like to the solid particles. Such matrix materials are porous in nature and may or may not be effective to help promote the desired OTP conversion. Filler and binder materials include, for example, synthetic and naturally occurring substances such as metal oxides, clays, silicas, aluminas, silica-aluminas, silica-magnesias, silica-zirconias, silica-thorias, silica-berylias, silica-titanias, silica-alumina-thorias, silica-alumina-zirconias, aluminophosphates, mixtures of these and the like. [0028]       If matrix materials, e.g., binder and/or filler materials, are included in the catalyst composition, the non-zeolitic and/or zeolitic molecular sieve catalyst preferably comprise 1 % to 99%, more preferably 5% to 90% and still more preferably 5% to 50%, by weight of the total composition.<br>
[0029]       The most preferred zeolitic dual-function catalyst for use in the OTP reaction step of the present invention is a zeolite having the structural configuration of ZSM-5, sometimes in the literature referred to as having a "pentasil-type" structure and disclosed in US 2003/0139635Al. A borosilicate zeolite having the ZSM-5 structural configuration is disclosed as a particularly preferred dual-function catalyst in US-A-4,433,188. The use of a zeolitic catalyst having the mordenite structural configuration is disclosed in GB-A-2171718.<br>
[0030]       Another particularly preferred class of dual-function catalyst for use in the present invention is the ELAPO molecular sieves. These materials catalyze both the direct conversion of oxygenates to light olefins and the interconversion of olefms to a desired product olefin as taught in US-A-4,677,243 and US-A-4,527,001. US-B-6,455,749 teaches the use of silicoalumino phosphate catalyst (SAPO) as a dual-function catalyst and specifically has a preference for SAPO-34 and teaches both the use of a SAPO-34 type of catalyst system and a ZSM-5 bound with silicalite type of catalyst system for use in the interconversion of €4 olefins to other olefins.<br>
[0031]       Best results with a non-zeolitic catalytic system are obtained when SAPO-34 is utilized as the dual-function catalyst. Best results with a zeolitic material are obtained with a<br><br>
ZSM-5 type of material. A particularly preferred feature of the invention uses a mixture of a zeolitic catalyst system with a non-zeolitic catalyst system. This mixed catalyst embodiment can use either a physical mixture of particles containing the zeolitic material with particles containing the non-zeolitic material or the catalyst or a formulation that mixes the two types of material into a binder to form particles having both ingredients present therein. In either case the preferred combination is a mixture of ZSM-5 with SAPO-34 in relative amounts such that SAPO-34 comprises 30 to 70 wt-% of the molecular sieve portion of the mixture with a value of 45 to 55 wt-% being especially preferred.<br>
[0032]       The contact time of the reactants with the dual-function catalyst is ordinarily measured in relative terms of a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) which is calculated on the basis of a mass hourly flow rate of the sum of the mass of oxygenate reactants passed to the OTP conversion zone plus the mass of any reactive hydrocarbon material present in the feedstream or any of the recycle streams divided by the mass of the dual-function catalyst present in the OTP conversion zone. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the contact time of the reactants with the catalyst is proportional to the inverse of the WHSV such that as the WHSV increases contact time decreases and conversely a decrease in WHSV produces an increase in contact time. WHSV for use in the OTP conversion zone associated with the present invention can range from 0.1 to 100 hr 1, with a preferred range being 0.5 to 20 hr'l, with best results ordinarily attained in the range of 0.5 to 10 hr'l. [0033]       In the oxygenate to propylene conversion step of the present invention it is preferred to use a dual-function catalyst having the capability of converting oxygenates to propylene as well as the capability of interconverting olefms other than propylene to propylene. Any of the catalytic materials known to the art that have the capability to catalyze these two reactions are suitable catalysts for use in the present invention. The preferred dual-function catalyst contains a molecular sieve as the active ingredient and more specifically the molecular sieve has relatively small pores. The preferred small pore catalysts are defined as having pores at least a portion, preferably a major portion, of which have an average effective diameter characterized such that the adsorption capacity (as measured by the standard McBain-Bakr gravimetric adsorption method using given adsorbate molecules) shows good adsorption of oxygen (average kinetic diameter of 0.346 nm) and negligible adsorption of isobutane (average kinetic diameter of 0.5 nm). More preferably the average effective diameter is characterized by good adsorption of xenon (average kinetic diameter of 0.4 nm) and negligible adsorption of isobutane, and most preferably, by good adsorption of n-hexane (average kinetic diameter of<br><br>
0.43 run) and negligible adsorption of isobutane. Negligible adsorption of a given adsorbate is adsorption of less than three percent by weight of the catalyst whereas good adsorption is an amount over this cut-off value in this test. Certain of the catalysts useful in the present invention have pores with an average effective diameter of less than 5 A. The average effective diameter of the pores of preferred catalysts is determined by measurements described in D. W. Breck, ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVES by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1974), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The term "effective diameter" is used to denote that occasionally the pores are irregularly shaped, e.g., elliptical, and thus the pore dimensions are characterized by the molecules that can be adsorbed rather than the actual dimensions. Preferably, the small pore catalysts have a substantially uniform pore structure, e.g., substantially uniformly sized and shaped pore. Suitable dual-function catalysts may be chosen from among zeolitic molecular sieves and non-zeolitic molecular sieves.<br>
[0034]       Zeolitic molecular sieves in the calcined form may be represented by the general formula:<br>
where Me is a cation, x has a value from 2 to infinity, n is the cation valence and y has a value of 2 to 100 or more and more typically 2 to 25.<br>
[0035]       Zeolites which may be used include chabazite - also referred to as Zeolite D, clinoptilolite, erionite, ferrierite, mordenite, Zeolite A, Zeolite P, ZSM-5, ZSM-1 1, and MCM-22. Zeolites having a high "silica content, (i.e., Those having silica to alumina ratios greater than 10 and typically greater than 100 with best results achieved at a silica to alumina mole ratio of 250:1 to 1000:1 are especially preferred.) One such high silica zeolite having the structure of ZSM-5 is silicalite, as the term used herein includes both the silicapolymorph disclosed in US-A-4,06 1,724 and also the F-silicate disclosed in US-A-4,073,865, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. One of the preferred zeolites for use in the present invention has the structure of ZSM-5 and is either ZSM-5 or silicalite or a mixture thereof. [0036]       Non-zeolitic molecular sieves include molecular sieves which have the proper effective pore size and are embraced by an empirical chemical composition, on an anhydrous basis, expressed by the empirical formula:<br>
(ELxAlyP2)02<br>
where EL is an element selected from the group consisting of silicon, magnesium, zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, chromium and mixtures thereof, x is the mole fraction of EL and is at least 0.005, y is the mole fraction of aluminum and is at least 0.01, z is the mole fraction of<br><br>
phosphorous and is at least 0.01 and x + y + z - 1. When EL is a mixture of metals, x represents the total amount of the element mixture present. Preferred elements (EL) are silicon, magnesium and cobalt with silicon being especially preferred.<br>
[0037]       The preparation of various ELAPOs are well known in the art and may be found in US-A-5,191,141 (ELAPO);US-A-4,554,143 (FeAPO); US-A-4,440,871 (SAPO); US-A-4,853,197 (MAPO, MnAPO, ZnAPO, CoAPO); US-A-4,793,984 (CAPO); US-A-4,752,651 and US-A-4,310,440; all of which are incorporated by reference. Generally, the ELAPO molecular sieves are synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization from a reaction mixture containing reactive sources of EL, aluminum, phosphorus and a templating agent. Reactive sources of EL are the metal salts such as the chloride and nitrate salts. When EL is silicon, a preferred source is fumed, colloidal or precipitated silica. Preferred reactive sources of aluminum and phosphorus are pseudo-boehmite alumina and phosphoric acid. Preferred templating agents are amines and quaternary ammonium compounds. An especially preferred templating agent is tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH).<br>
[0038]       A preferred embodiment of the invention is one in which the element (EL) content varies from 0.005 to 0.05 mole fraction. If EL is more than one element, then the total concentration of all the elements is between 0.005 and 0.05 mole fraction. An especially preferred embodiment is one in which EL is silicon (usually referred to as SAPO). The SAPOs which can be used in the instant invention are any of those described in US-A-4,440,871; US-A-5,126,308, and US-A-5,191,141. Of the specific crystallographic structures described in the '871 patent, the SAPO-34, i.e., structure type 34, is preferred. The SAPO-34 structure is characterized in that it adsorbs xenon but does not adsorb isobutane, indicating that it has a pore opening of 4.2 A. Another SAPO, SAPO-17, as exemplified in Examples 25 and 26 of the '871 patent, is also preferred. The SAPO-17 structure is characterized in that it adsorbs oxygen, hexane, and water but does not adsorb isobutane, indicating that it has a pore opening of greater than 4.3 A and less than 5.0 A. [0039]       The preferred OTP conversion catalyst is preferably incorporated into porous solid particles in which the catalyst is present in an amount effective to promote the desired OTP reactions. In one aspect, the porous solid particles comprise a catalytically effective amount of the molecular sieve catalyst and at least one matrix material, preferably selected from the group consisting of binder materials, filler materials, and mixtures thereof to provide a desired property or properties, e.g., desired catalyst dilution, mechanical strength, and the like to the solid particles. Such matrix materials are porous in nature and may or may not be effective to help<br><br>
promote the desired OTP conversion. Filler and binder materials include, for example, synthetic and naturally occurring substances such as metal oxides, clays, silicas, aluminas, silica-aluminas, silica-magnesias, silica-zirconias, silica-thorias, silica-berylias, silica-titanias, silica-alumina-thorias, silica-alumina-zirconias, aluminophosphates, mixtures of these and the like. [0040]       If matrix materials, e.g., binder and/or filler materials, are included in the catalyst composition, the non-zeolitic and/or zeolitic molecular sieve catalyst preferably comprise 1 % to 99%, more preferably 5% to 90% and still more preferably 5% to 50%, by weight of the total composition. The preparation of solid particles comprising molecular sieve catalyst and matrix materials is conventional and well known in the art. To facilitate movement of the dual-function catalyst through the moving bed reactors associated with the present invention it is highly preferred that the particles of the catalyst be spherical or near spherical in shape. The diameter of these catalyst particles is preferably selected from the range of 0.5 to 7 mm (0.02 to 0.28 in) with best results usually obtained with spherical particles that have an effective diameter of 1.6 mm (0.063 in).<br>
[0041]       The most preferred zeolitic dual-function catalyst for use in the present invention is a zeolite having the structural configuration of ZSM-5, sometimes in the literature referred to as having a "pentasil-type" structure. A good example of this type of dual-function catalyst is disclosed in US 2003/0139635A1, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. A borosilicate zeolite having the ZSM-5 structural configuration is disclosed as a particularly preferred dual-function catalyst in US-A-4,433,188, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The dual-function use of a ZSM-5 catalyst system is disclosed in US-A-4,579,999 wherein a methanol to olefin conversion zone is also charged with a recycle stream containing ethylene and a separate olefm-rich €5+ gasoline stream to increase the yield of €3 to €4 olefins in the first stage MTO reaction zone disclosed therein. This '999 patent contains a good disclosure of the dual-function use of a ZSM-5 catalyst system and is specifically inco^orated herein by reference. The use of a zeolitic catalyst having the mordenite structural configuration is specifically disclosed in GB-A-2171718 wherein a dealuminated mordenite catalyst system having a silicon to aluminum atomic ratio higher than 80:1 and a sodium oxide content less than 0.1 by weight is utilized to convert a methanol-containing feedstream and a C^ olefin-rich recycle stream to maximize the production of propylene from these materials. All of the teachings of this '718 published patent application are specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[0042]       Another particularly preferred class of dual-function catalyst for use in the present invention is the ELAPO molecular sieves. These materials are known to catalyze both the direct conversion of oxygenates to light olefins and the interconversion of olefins to a desired product olefin as can be seen from the combined teachings of US-A-4,677,243 and US-A-4,527,001. US-B-6,455,749 has specific teachings on the use of silicoalumino phosphate catalyst (SAPO) as a dual-function catalyst and specifically has a preference for SAPO-34 as is taught in the first example contained therein. In addition the second example of this '749 patent contains a reasonably clear teaching of both the use of a SAPO-34 type of catalyst system and a ZSM-5 bound with silicalite type of catalyst system for use in the interconversion of €4 olefins to other olefins. The teachings of the '243, '001 and '749 patents are hereby specifically incorporated by reference.<br>
[0043]       Best results with a non-zeolitic catalytic system are obtained when SAPO-34 is utilized as the dual-function catalyst. On the other hand best results with a zeolitic material are obtained with a ZSM-5 type of material such as the ZSM-5 materials described in the '749 patent. A particularly preferred feature of the invention is the use of a mixture of a zeolitic catalyst system with a non-zeolitic catalyst system. This mixed catalyst embodiment can be accomplished either using a physical mixture of particles containing the zeolitic material with particles containing the non-zeolitic material or the catalyst can be formulated by mixing the two types of material into a binder to form particles having both ingredients present therein. In either case the preferred combination is a mixture of ZSM-5 with SAPO-34 in relative amounts such that SAPO-34 comprises 30 to 70 wt-% of the molecular sieve portion of the mixture with a value of 45 to 55 wt-% being especially preferred. [0044]       The selective hydrogen treatment step of the present invention selectively hydrogenates highly unsaturated hydrocarbons such as dienes and/or acetylenic hydrocarbons that are formed in the OTP conversion step in minor amounts (i.e. less than 2 wt-% of the amount of oxygenate feed converted and typically 0.01 to 1 wt-% of the amount converted). These highly unsaturated hydrocarbons are a very significant contributor to the rate of coke deposition on the preferred dual-function OTP catalyst used in this invention and tend to concentrate in the heavy olefin by-product streams recovered from the OTP conversion step. Recycling one or more of these heavy olefin by-product streams to the OTP conversion step can cause OTP catalyst instability and lead to a significant loss in propylene selectively. There are at least two possible sources of heavy olefin recycle streams for use in the present invention, the €4+ olefm-rich fraction separated from the vaporous fraction is derived from<br><br>
the effluent stream from the OTP conversion step and the second source second C4+ olefin-rich stream that is separated from the liquid hydrocarbon fraction recovered in this OTP effluent cooling and separation step. In accordance with the present invention, at least a portion of one or both of these €4+ olefin-rich streams is charged to the selective hydrogen treatment step to selectively convert these coke precursors to the corresponding olefins. Preferably at least 50 wt-% of any heavy olefm recycle stream is charged to this hydrotreating step and more preferably 70 to 95 wt-% or more of any such stream. The possible presence of acetylene in trace amounts in the €2 olefin-rich stream from the OTP effluent stream puts within the scope of this invention the charging of at least a portion of any recovered €2 olefin-rich fraction recovered to this hydrotreating step prior to recycling to the OTP conversion step since the dual-function OTP catalyst can interconvert ethylene to propylene. If the amount of acetylene in this 62 olefm recycle stream is too high, the preferred practice is to charge at least 50 wt-% and more preferably 70 to 95 wt-% or more of such €2 olefin-rich recycle stream to the hydrotreatment step.<br>
[0045]       The selective hydrogen treatment step contacts at least a portion of one or more of the heavy olefin recycle streams and hydrogen with a metal-containing hydrogenation catalyst at selective hydrogenation conditions effective to convert any highly unsaturated hydrocarbons contained therein to the corresponding olefins. The catalyst is preferably maintained in the hydrotreatment zone as a fixed bed of catalyst particles. These particles preferably have a diameter of 1 to 10 mm (0.04 to 0.4 in) and/or a L/D of 1 to 5. [0046]       The selective hydrogenation conditions are selected to effectively convert highly unsaturated hydrocarbons to the corresponding olefins while minimizing or eliminating any over-hydrogenation to the corresponding fully saturated hydrocarbon. This step typically runs at a temperature of 30 to 250°C with best results at 75 to 150°C; a pressure of 1 to 40 atm or more (101 kPa to 4.05 MPa) which is sufficient to maintain a liquid phase and a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1 to 30 hr"1 with best results achieved at a LHSV of 5 to 20 hf1.<br>
[0047]       The amount of hydrogen charged to this treatment step provides 0.8 to 10 moles, preferably 1 to 2.5 moles, of hydrogen per mole of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons charged thereto. At least a portion of the hydrogen can be dissolved in or admixed with the olefin-containing feed stream to this step or it can be added independently to the hydrotreatment zone in concurrent or countercurrent relationship to the heavy olefm-containing feed stream using technologies well-known to those skilled in this art.<br><br>
[0048]       The hydrogenation catalyst can be any selective hydrogenation catalysts for this application and is preferably a combination of a catalytically effective amount of a metal hydrogenating component with a suitable porous carrier material. In some cases an olefin selectivity enhancing component (i.e. an attenuator) can be added to the catalyst in an amount sufficient to block or substantially eliminate any hydrogenation side reactions that produce a fully saturated hydrocarbon.<br>
[0049]       The metal hydrogenating component is preferably selected from the group of nickel, palladium, platinum and mixtures thereof with nickel being preferred. The amount used preferably provides a hydrogenation catalyst that contains 0.01 to 5 wt-% and preferably 0.05 to 2 wt-% of the metal component calculated on the metal. At least a significant portion of this metal hydrogenating component is preferably maintained in the hydrogenation catalyst in a metallic state although in some cases a metallic compound may be used, such as the corresponding metallic oxide and/or sulfide, with good results.<br>
[0050]       The optional attenuation component will be selected from the group consisting of copper, silver, gold, gallium, iridium and mixtures thereof. The amount of the attenuator component added to the hydrogenation catalyst will generally produce 0.01 to 2 wt-% thereof, calculated on the metal, with an amount of 0.01 to 1 wt-% generally giving best results. Preferably a substantial portion of copper, silver or gold attenuators are utilized in the metallic state. In contrast gallium or iridium attenuator components are best when a substantial portion is maintained in the oxide state.<br>
[0051]       The porous carrier material for this hydrogenation catalyst can be any suitable material from the hydrotreating art. Suitable porous carrier material will generally have a surface area of 10 to 50 m2/g and include the following materials: 1) silica, silica gel, clays and silicates including those synthetically prepared and naturally occurring, which may or may not be acid treated, for example, attapulgus clay, china clay, diatomaceous earth, fuller's earth, kaolin, bentonite, kieselgurh, etc.; (2) refractory inorganic oxides such as alumina, 
 <br>
[0052]       Suitable alumina materials are the crystalline aluminas known as gamma-, eta-and theta-alumina, with gamma- or eta-alumina giving best results. In addition the alumina carrier material may contain minor proportions of alkali and/or alkaline earth oxides and/or other well known refractory inorganic oxides such as silica, zirconia, magnesia, etc.; however, the preferred catalyst is substantially pure gamma- or eta-alumina. Preferred catalysts have an apparent bulk density of 0.3 to 0.9 g/cc and surface area characteristics such that the average pore diameter is 20 to 300 Angstroms, the pore volume is 0.1 to 1 cc/g and the surface area is 100 to 500 m2/g. Best results are typically obtained with a gamma-alumina carrier material in the form of spherical particles having: a relatively small diameter of 1 to 10 mm (0.04 to 0.4 in) an apparent bulk density of 0.3 to 0.8 g/cc, a pore volume of 0.4 ml/g, and a surface area of 150 to 250 m2/g.<br>
[0053]       The hydrogenation catalyst can be prepared by any technique known and preferably involves preforming the porous carrier material and then adding the metallic component and the optional attenuator component by impregnation and/or spraying these ingredients on to the porous support either sequentially or simultaneously. The present invention may use a "skin" or "outer shell" impregnation technique to concentrate the active component on or near the perimeter of the porous support. The resulting impregnated or sprayed porous support will then be dried at a temperature of 50 to 200°C and typically calcined in air at a temperature of 250 to 750°C for a period of 5 to 100 hours. The resulting catalyst can undergo an optional reduction step typically with free hydrogen at a temperature of 250 to 750°C for 1 to 10 hours.<br>
[0054]       Although this invention includes both a fixed bed mode of operation and a moving bed mode of operation for the OTP conversion step, a highly preferred feature is the use of moving bed technology in an OTP conversion step to enhance the selectivity of the process for propylene production. The use of moving bed technology is shown in US-A-5,157,181. Suitable moving bed reactors and regeneration systems have been widely employed commercially for example in the catalytic reforming of naphtha fractions to increase octane number and to facilitate the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to make olefins. [0055]       Moving bed reaction zones can have various configurations. The catalyst particles can be introduced to an upper section of the reaction zone and fed by gravity through the entire volume of the reaction zone, wherein the catalyst is contacted with the feedstream either in a countercurrent direction to the catalyst movement or in a concurrent direction. In a preferred aspect of the present invention the feedstream flow is countercurrent to the catalyst<br><br>
flow with the feedstream introduced into a lower portion of the reaction zone and withdrawn from an upper portion thereof. This preferred configuration can provide substantial advantages in OTP conversion reactions by contacting the feedstream with partially deactivated catalyst during the initial stages of the conversion when the driving force is high and more active catalysts during the subsequent stages of the conversion when the driving force is lower.<br>
[0056]       More typically the catalyst particles are introduced into an annulus defined by concentric catalyst retaining screens that runs through the reaction zone, wherein the catalyst particles travel down through the annulus and are withdrawn from a lower section of the OTP reaction zone. The feedstream is introduced either to the upper or lower section of the reaction zone and is passed across the annulus generally in a direction transverse to the catalyst flow. The radial bed configuration can provide low pressure drop across the reaction zone, hence good flow distribution.<br>
[0057]       During the OTP conversion zone traversal, a carbonaceous material, i.e., coke, is deposited on the catalyst as it moved downward through the reaction zone. The carbonaceous deposit material reduces the number of active sites on the catalyst thereby affecting the extent of the conversion and the selectivity to propylene. Thus during the moving bed conversion process a portion of the coked catalyst is withdrawn from the OTP reaction zone and regenerated in a regeneration zone to remove at least a portion of the carbonaceous material. For a fixed bed embodiment of the OTP conversion step, the on-stream portion of the process will be stopped when the conversion drops to an unacceptable level and the OTP catalyst is regenerated in situ.<br>
[0058]       Preferably the carbonaceous material is removed from the catalyst by oxidative regeneration wherein the catalyst which is withdrawn from the reactor is contacted with an oxygen-containing gas at sufficient temperature and oxygen concentration to allow the desired amount of the carbonaceous materials to be removed from the catalyst. In the fixed bed embodiment, an oxygen-containing gas stream is charged to the OTP reaction zone. Depending upon the particular catalyst and conversion it can be desirable to substantially remove the carbonaceous material, e.g., to less than 1 wt-% and more preferably less than 0.5 wt-%. In some eases it is advantageous to only partially regenerate the catalyst, e.g., to remove from 30 to 80 wt-% of the carbonaceous material. Preferably, the regenerated catalyst will contain 0 to 20 wt-% and more preferably from 0 to 10 wt-% carbonaceous material. Preferably in most instances when relatively large concentrations of carbonaceous<br><br>
material (i.e. coke) are present on the catalyst, that is, greater than 1 wt-% carbonaceous material on the catalyst, carbon burn-off occurs with an oxygen-containing gas stream containing a relatively low concentration of oxygen. Preferably the oxygen content of oxygen containing gas is regulated through the use of inert gases or the recycling of flue gas materials to maintain an initial oxygen level of from 0.5 to 2 vol.-%. By using the small concentration of oxygen, it is possible to reasonably control the oxidation of carbonaceous materials upon the catalyst without allowing excessively high temperatures to occur, thereby preventing the possibility of permanently hydrothermaHy damaging the molecular sieve catalyst. Temperatures used during regeneration should be in the range of 400° to 700°C with best results obtained at 500° to 650°C. The regeneration zone in the moving bed embodiment is preferably configured as a moving bed zone similar to the moving bed configuration used in the OTP reaction zone with coked catalyst fed to an upper portion of the regeneration zone and passed by gravity feed through the regeneration zone wherein the carbonaceous material is removed and the regenerated catalyst is withdrawn from a lower section of the regeneration zone and recirculated to the OTP reaction zone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0059]       The attached drawing shows a schematic representation of a flow scheme of the present invention in which a reaction zone comprising reactors 1, 2 and 3 contains dual-function OTP conversion catalyst in a moving bed configuration. The three moving bed reactors 1, 2 and 3, are in serial configuration both with respect to the oxygenate feed and to the flow of catalyst through the reactors. The illustrated vertical cross section of the reactors shows catalyst descending through an annulus 33 which is maintained with appropriate concentric catalyst retaining screens. All three moving bed reactors operate with the charge to the reactor flowing in countercurrent relationship to the descending stream of catalyst particles. Preferably all three moving bed reactors have the oxygenate-containing feed stream flowing from the outside of the catalyst annulus 33 into the center portion from which the effluent stream is recovered. The drawing shows the flow of feed materials, intermediate materials and product materials by solid lines and the flow of catalyst to and from the reaction zones by dotted lines. A transport medium, preferably steam, nitrogen or any other available inert diluents transports the catalyst. The preferred catalyst transport medium is steam due to its substantial presence in the OTP reaction zone.<br><br>
[0060]       The OTP catalyst utilized in reactors 1, 2 and 3 is selected from the dual-function catalyst previously described and is utilized in a spherical form having a effective diameter of .5 to 5 mm with a diameter of 1.6 mm being especially preferred. The total amount of OTP catalyst is preferably divided equally among the three OTP reactors. [0061]       The number of reactors in the reaction zone is selected to hold the conversion conditions in the individual reactors at conditions which enhance the yield of propylene by limiting the temperature differential across the individual reactors to 80°C or less thereby avoiding a shift in the yield structure towards ethylene and simultaneously minimizing the coke formation on the catalyst which accelerates rapidly at the tail end of the OTP reaction zone.<br>
[0062]       During startup of the process recycle lines 14, 17, 21 and 22 are blocked off until sufficient product material is obtained for initiation of recycle. Similarly water diluent recycle through lines 13, 28 and 29 will be blocked off and instead an outside source of either water or steam will be injected into line 13 by means not shown just prior to the interconnection with line 8. At startup an alcoholic oxygenate feedstream flows via line 8 to the intersection with line 13 where an appropriate amount of added diluent in the form of water or steam will provide an oxygenate to diluent ratio of 0.1:1 to 5:1 with a value of 0.5:1 to 2:1 being especially preferred for startup. The resulting mixture of oxygenate feed and diluent passes through appropriate feed and effluent heat exchange and heating means (not shown) to vaporize the resulting stream and provide a charge stream for reactor 1 that enters the reactor at a temperature of 350° to 475°C and a total pressure of 136 to 343 kPa (5 to 35 psig). Reactors 1, 2, and 3 contain sufficient dual-function OTP catalyst to provide a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.5 to 5 hr1 during startup with the effective WHSV rising to a level of 1 to 10 hr"1 once recycle of olefinic hydrocarbon material commences. Line 9 withdraws effluent material from reactor 1, reduces its temperature to a value close to the temperature of the charge to reactor 1 via one or more cooling means not shown, and charges the resulting cooled effluent stream to reactor 2 wherein it contacts a dual-function catalyst to convert additional amounts of oxygenate material to propylene with production of an effluent stream withdrawn via line 10. Appropriate means (not shown) cool the effluent in line 10 to a temperature close to the inlet temperature to reactor 1 which passes into reactor 3 and contacts an additional amount of dual-function catalyst under conditions which result in further conversion of unreacted oxygenate to propylene and various other by-products.<br><br>
Maintaining similar temperature differentials across the reactor of the second reaction zone minimizes coking of the catalyst in reactors 2 and 3 to the same degree as in reactor 1. [0063]       Line 11 withdraws the effluent stream from reactor 3, an appropriate cooling step liquefies a substantial amount of the water contained therein via one or more cooling means such as a feed/effluent exchanger (not shown), and passes the effluent to a three-phase separator, zone 5, in which forms a hydrocarbon vapor phase, a liquid hydrocarbon phase and a water phase containing significant amounts of any unreacted oxygenate that escapes from reactor 3. By maintaining the activity of the dual-function catalyst at essentially start-of-cycle conditions this invention expects to pass a minimal amount of unreacted oxygenate into zone 5 and to achieve an overall conversion of oxygenate feed achieving through 1, 2 and 3 of 97% or greater during the entire cycle.<br>
[0064]       Line 13 withdraws the aqueous phase from separator 5. A drag stream taken by line 23 disposes of surplus water. Line 13 recycles the resulting net water stream into admixture with the oxygenate feed at the junction of line 8. Lines 28 and 29 may add additional quantities of water for to reactors 2 and 3 for cooling purposes and partial pressure adjustment. The initiation of water recycle terminates the startup provisions for injection of diluent water.<br>
[0065]       A line 12 withdraws a vapor phase from separator 5 and charges it to fractionation column 6 which acts as a deethanizer and operates to produce an ethylene-rich overhead fraction 14 that also contains minor amounts of ethane and some methane and trace amounts of acetylene. Fractionation column 6 produces a bottom fraction 15 which essentially comprises the C3+ portion of the material charged to column 6. A line 18 withdraws a drag stream from the overhead stream 14 to control the buildup of Cj and C^ paraffins in the ethylene recycle loop. The ethylene recycle loop may require additional treatment of the ethylene rich overhead stream to remove methane from this stream and prevent the buildup of a^significant methane concentration. Any suitable means may be used and include a demethanizer column, a methane adsorption zone, and a methane-selective membrane zone. Line 18 may take 1 to 15 vol-% of the overhead stream flowing through line 14 and more typically will comprise 1 to 10 vol-% of this stream. Line 14 charges the remainder of the overhead stream to reactor 1 as an ethylene-rich recycle stream via line 8. The present invention may apportion the ethylene-rich recycle stream flowing in line 14 between the three reactor zones but the drawing depicts the preferred flow arrangement that charges the entire amount of this ethylene to reactor 1 and results in superior ethylene conversion when by its<br><br>
exposure to the maximum amount of available catalyst as it flows through the three reactor zones.<br>
[0066]       When the C^ olefin-rich stream flowing in line 14 contains significant acetylene the present invention may divert at least a portion of this stream to hydro treatment zone 30 by means not shown for the selective hydrogenation of the acetylene content ethylene. The resulting hydrogen-treated C2 olefin-rich recycle stream would return to OTP reactor 1 via lines 32 and 8, reactor 2 via lines 32, 21 and 9, reactor 3 lines 32, 21, 22 and 10. [0067]       Line 15 charges the C3+ material of the bottom stream to depropanizer column 7 at fractionation conditions that produce a propylene-rich overhead stream 16 as the principal product stream of the present invention and which contains minor amounts of by-product propane materials. Line 17 withdraws the bottom stream of C^~ olefin-rich material which primarily comprises €4 €5 and Cg olefinic material along with very minor amounts of butane and pentane from column 7.<br>
[0068]       Line 17 passes all or a major portion of this bottom stream to selective hydrogen treatment zone 30 which contains a fixed bed of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising 0.01 to 5 wt-% nickel on a porous alumina support. Line 31 charges a hydrogen-rich stream to the hydrotreatment zone 30. Line 31 contains sufficient hydrogen to provide 0.9 to 5 moles of hydrogen per mole of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons charged to zone 30. In zone 30 the €4+ olefin-rich stream and the hydrogen stream contact the nickel-containing hydrogenation catalyst at selective hydrogenation conditions effective to convert substantially all of the highly unsaturated hydrocarbons to the corresponding olefm. The specific conditions in zone 30 include: inlet temperatures of 75 to 150°C, a pressure of 101 kPa to 405 MPa which is selected to maintain a substantially liquid stream condition in zone 30 and a LHSV of 1 to 30 hr" . Line 32 withdraws from zone 30 a selectively hydrogen treated C4+ olefin-rich recycle stream substantially free of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons that has much less potential for accelerating coke formation in OTP reaction zones 1, 2 and 3. A line 19 takes a drag stream from line 32 in an amount of 1 to 15 vol-% and preferably 1 to 3 vol-% in to control buildup of paraffinic materials in this C^ olefin recycle loop. [0069]        The remainder of the C^+ material flowing through line 32 passes into interconnections with line 21 that together provide hydrogen treated C^+ olefin reactants to reactors 1, 2 and 3 via lines 32, 21 and 22. Once recycle operations commence these lines are unblocked to facilitate the return of these hydrogen treated €4+ olefin recycle streams, Preferably the recycle of the hydrogen treated €4+ olefin-rich stream flowing through line 32<br><br>
is divided into 3 portions and charged in parallel to the three reactors. Preferably the major portion be passed to reactor 1 and minor portions be passed to reactors 2 and 3 and more preferably 60 to 80 vol-% of the total amount of this hydrogen treated €4+ olefin-rich recycle stream flows to reactor 1 via lines 32 and 8 with equal portions of .10 to 20 vol-% flow simultaneously to reactors 2 and 3.<br>
[0070]       Once the three recycle streams flowing through lines 13, 14 and 32 are up and running then the startup mode of the instant invention is terminated and the full recycle mode of operation commences with the dual-function catalyst beds located in reactors 1,2 and 3 functioning as oxygenate conversion catalyst and as olefm interconversion catalyst. In the full recycle mode an alcoholic oxygenate rich feedstream enters the process via line 8 and admixes with a first ethlylene rich recycle stream carried in line 14 and then with a water diluent in line 13. The resulting admixture passes to the intersection of line 32 where mixture with an additional quantity of C^+ olefinic material forms the charge to reactor 1. This charge mixture flows into reactor 1 in a manner previously described after suitable heating to the appropriate inlet temperature.<br>
[0071]       After passage through the bed of catalyst maintained in reactor 1 line withdraws the resulting effluent. Lines 28 adds an additional quantity of relatively cool water diluent along and line 21 adds an additional quantity of the relatively cool €4"*" olefin-rich recycle stream. After suitable cooling to achieve the prescribed inlet temperature set forth for reactor 2 the resulting mixture enters reactor 2 wherein it makes a passage through the bed of catalyst to produce an effluent stream. Line 10 withdraws the effluent and flows into admixture with an additional quantum of relatively cool water diluent from line 29 and an additional quantum of relatively cool C4+olefin-rich material from line 22. After cooling of the resulting mixture to the prescribed inlet temperature line 10 delivers the mixture to reactor 3 for contact with the catalyst therein and production of an effluent stream which after appropriate quench and cooling flows through line 11 to three-phase separating zone 5. [0072]       The amount of dual-function catalyst utilized in OTP reactors 1, 2 and 3 can vary. Reactors 2 and 3 may contain larger amounts of catalyst to make up for the slight amount of deactivation that occurs in reactor 1 when the catalyst flows to reactor 2 via line 25 and in reactor 2 when the catalyst flows from reactor 2 to reactor 3 via line 26. Preferably reactors 1, 2, and 3 run with essentially equal amounts of catalyst in the three zones or with a division which of approximately 25 to 30% of the total catalyst in each of reactors 1 and 2 and the remaining 40 to 50 vol-% in reactor 3.<br><br>
[0073]       The OTP process starts catalyst circulation after the reactors are lined out at operating conditions. Catalyst circulates between the reactors via lines 25 and 26 and to regenerator zone 4 via line 27. Regeneration zone 4 removes at least a portion of the deposits from the coke-containing catalyst charged thereto via line 27 using a low severity oxidative procedure as previously explained. The regeneration zone 4 also receives by means not shown an oxygen-containing gas stream containing 0.5 to 2 vol-% oxygen which and supplied in an amount sufficient to support combustion of a major portion of the coke charged to this zone. Line 24 completes a catalyst circulation circuit defined by lines 25, 26, 27 and 24 by recirculating catalyst to reactor 1 via. A flue gas stream is withdrawn from zone 4 via a line not shown.<br>
[0074]       The flow of catalyst around this catalyst circulation circuit is selected to provide a catalyst on-stream cycle time of 400 hours or less to maintain catalyst activity, oxygenate conversion and propylene selectivity at or near start of cycle conditions. Accordingly the catalyst particles flow around this circuit such that a catalyst particle's residence time in reactors 1, 2 and 3 is not more than 400 hours before it returns to zone 4 for regeneration. [0075]       Line 32 withdraws the hydrocarbon phase from three-phase separator zone 5. This material generally boils in the gasoline range and can comprise a second 04+ olefin-rich recycle stream containing trace amounts of diene and acetylenic hydrocarbons and can comprise a gasoline product stream of the present invention which may require further 'treatment due to the high content of olefmic material that is present therein. Preferably the liquid hydrocarbon phase of line 32 passes to an additional fractionation step in column 33 to recover a C^+ olefmic rich overhead stream via line 35, at least a portion of which can be selectively hydrogen treated therein. The resulting hydrogen treated stream passes to zone 30 via lines 35 and 17 and recycled back to reactors 1, 2 and 3 to provide a means for additional conversion of heavy olefins to propylene. Line 33 recovers a bottom stream from column 33 that comprises the plefin-rich gasoline product stream. The preferred means for recycling any such second €4+ olefin-rich stream is with the bottom stream from column 7 and in fact this second C4+ olefin-rich overhead stream can be directly charged to zone 30 via lines 35 and 17 for selective hydrogen treatment of the dienes and acetylenic hydrocarbons to the corresponding olefin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
