				<td>Particle-containing etching pastes for silicon surfaces and layers<br>
The present invention relates to particle-containing etching media in the<br>
form of etching pastes which are suitable for full-area or selective etch-<br>
ing of extremely fine lines or structures in silicon surfaces and layers<br>
and in glass-like surfaces formed from suitable silicon compounds. The<br>
present invention also relates to the use of the pastes according to the<br>
invention in processes for the etching of such surfaces.<br>
Prior art<br>
In the photovoltaics, electronics and semiconductor industries, silicon<br>
surfaces and layers are often etched by wet-chemical methods in dip<br>
baths. This full-area etching can be carried out either in an acidic<br>
medium (isotropic etching) or in an alkaline medium (anisotropic etch-<br>
ing). In acidic etching, use is frequently made of mixtures of hydrofluoric<br>
acid and nitric acid, while in alkaline etching, strong bases, such as<br>
sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, tetramethyl-<br>
ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), etc., are frequently used.<br>
In order to produce defined, fine etching patterns or structures (for<br>
example for buried structures) in addition to full-area etching (for exam-<br>
ple polish etches, texture etches), material-intensive, time-consuming<br>
and expensive process steps, such as, for example, the photolithogra-<br>
phic masking process known to the person skilled in the art, were<br>
necessary before the actual etching step up until some time ago.<br>
In a masking process of this type, the starting material is usually a sili-<br>
con wafer. A dense oxide layer is produced thereon by thermal oxida-<br>
tion and structured as follows.<br>
By coating with a photoresist, subsequent drying, exposure to UV light<br>
using a photomask, and subsequent development, the oxide is uncov-<br>
ered at the desired points and then removed using hydrofluoric acid.<br>
The photoresist which still remains is subsequently removed<br>
("stripped"), for example using a solvent. The Si wafer thus provided<br><br>
with an oxide mask can then be etched selectively at the points not cov-<br>
ered by the oxide in a strong base, such as, for example, 30% KOH.<br>
The oxide mask is resistant to the base. After selective etching of the<br>
silicon, the oxide mask is usually removed again using hydrofluoric acid.<br>
Lithographic processes of this type are not used in the industrial pro-<br>
duction of solar cells for cost reasons [1]. However, selective structuring<br>
or opening of the silicon surface or layer is also necessary in the<br>
modified production process.<br>
During the production of a standard silicon solar cell, the p-n junction<br>
necessary for the photoelectric effect is formed on a p-doped wafer, for<br>
example by gas diffusion in a POCI3 oven. An n-doped silicon layer with<br>
a thickness of about 500 nm is formed around the entire wafer and has<br>
to be partially opened or parted for the later photovoltaic application.<br>
This opening can be carried out mechanically by laser cutting or in a<br>
dry-etching process, such as plasma etching.<br>
Disadvantages of mechanical parting, for example grinding-off of the<br>
cell edges in the final step of the production process (after metallisa-<br>
tion), are associated with losses of silicon material (and metal paste),<br>
produce mechanical stress, and may cause crystal defects in the solar<br>
cell.<br>
Plasma etching is carried out with fluorinated hydrocarbons, for example<br>
with CF4 or C2F6 gas, in expensive vacuum equipment. In this process,<br>
the cells are stacked in advance and etched at the cell edges in the<br>
plasma-etching unit. Considerable handling problems during stacking<br>
and high wafer breakage rates frequently occur in this process. These<br>
technological problems will intensify even more in the future since the<br>
aim is, owing to high material costs, to use ever thinner polycrystalline<br>
silicon starting substrates (
thicknesses of 250-330 urn which are usual today.<br><br>
Owing to the requisite linear (XY) movement of the punctiform laser<br>
source, parting of the p-n junction by laser is a time-consuming,<br>
throughput-limiting process. The investment costs for this are consider-<br>
able. In addition, local crystal defects are generated.<br>
In expensive processes for the production of a selective emitter, which<br>
have currently only been developed and used on a laboratory scale, the<br>
lithographic oxide masking already described above is used. The oxide<br>
masks the wafer in such a way that the areas on which the contacts will<br>
later lie remain free. The masked wafer is subjected to phosphorus dif-<br>
fusion and n++-doped in the non-masked areas. After removal of the<br>
oxide mask, the entire wafer is n+-doped [2].<br>
This gives a solar cell with a selective emitter, i.e. with highly doped n++<br>
areas with a depth of 2-3 urn (areas without oxide mask and later lying<br>
under the contacts) with a doping concentration of about 1*1020 cm"3<br>
and a flat (0.5-1 urn) n+-doped emitter over the entire solar cell with a<br>
doping concentration of about 1*1019 cm"3.<br>
An alternative to the lithography method is the use of screen-printed<br>
contact lines as etching mask. For the production thereof, both wet-<br>
chemical and plasma-chemical etching are described in the literature.<br>
Disadvantages of dipping the screen-printed solar cell into a mixture of<br>
HF/HNO3 - besides the intended removal of silicon between the contact<br>
lines - are attack of the silicon beneath the contact lines and the etching<br>
damage that may arise in the metal contact lines themselves. This<br>
causes rapid impairment of the fill factor [3].<br>
Plasma-chemical etching (reactive ion etching, RIE) is carried out using<br>
gases, such as, for example, SF6 or SFe/02, in expensive vacuum<br>
equipment and with considerable technological optimisation effort for<br>
the process [4], [5], [6].<br>
Besides the formation of the selective emitter, the silicon surface here is<br>
structured (roughened, "textured") on the emitter side in such a way that<br>
the antireflection behaviour of the solar cell improves.<br><br>

Object<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a correspond-<br>
ing simple and inexpensive process and an etching paste which can be<br>
employed therein, enabling the disadvantages and problems outlined<br>
above to be avoided and by means of which silicon surfaces can be<br>
etched selectively for the production of emitters and in order to improve<br>
the antireflection behaviour.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The object is achieved, in particular, by the provision of an etching<br>
medium for etching silicon surfaces and layers in the form of a thick-<br>
ened, paste-form, alkaline composition which, besdies suitable thicken-<br>
ers, comprises extremely fine, low-melting polymer particles.<br>
Particle-containing, alkaline compositions of this type can be prepared<br>
inexpensively. They can be applied rapidly and selectively to the areas<br>
to be etched, for example using a screen printer or a dispenser. The<br>
desired etching process is carried out, preferably at elevated tempera-<br>
tures, after the paste has been printed on in the form of extremely fine<br>
lines and structures. Surprisingly, the particles present have a stabilising<br>
action here on the shapes of the printed-on lines and structures of the<br>
etching pastes.<br>
Besides the described opening of the p-n junctions of a solar cell, se-<br>
lective (also two-stage) emitters are produced in mass production by<br>
selective etching of silicon using the etching pastes according to the<br>
invention. At the same time, the use of the novel etching pastes facili-<br>
tates an improvement in the antireflection behaviour of the solar cell,<br>
enabling undercutting of the silicon layers at ridges, edges and in<br>
etched trenches to be inhibited or prevented.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a printable and dispensable<br>
alkaline etching medium in the form of a particle-containing etching<br>
paste which comprises<br><br>
a.	at least one solvent,<br>
b.	optionally thickening agents,<br>
c.	extremely fine organic particles having a low melting point and<br>
optionally extremely fine inorganic particles,<br>
d.	optionally additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-<br>
control agents, deaerators, adhesion promoters.<br>
This etching medium is effective in the process according to the<br>
invention at temperatures higher than 70°C, it can preferably be<br>
employed at temperatures above 150°C, but lower than 200°C, with<br>
low-melting particles present melting.<br>
Etching media according to the invention comprise, as etching<br>
component, an organic or inorganic base, preferably at least one<br>
component selected from the group sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, ammonia, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, tetraalkyl-<br>
ammonium hydroxide or a mixture of these bases. It is also possible<br>
to employ mixtures, such as, for example, ethylenediamine/pyro-<br>
catechol, ethanolamine/gallic acid. However, bases from the first-<br>
mentioned group are preferentially used for this purpose. Sodium<br>
hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide are particularly preferentially<br>
used as etching components in the compositions. Accordingly,<br>
etching media according to the invention preferably comprise NaOH<br>
and/or KOH as etching component in a concentration of 2 to 50%<br>
by weight, preferably 5 to 48% by weight, based on the total<br>
amount.<br>
An essential constituent of the pastes according to the invention<br>
which advantageously influences the etching result are finely par-<br>
ticulate powders. These may be both inorganic and organic pow-<br>
ders. They are preferably organic polymer powders having a low<br>
melting point. Polyolefin powders have proven particularly suitable,<br>
especially polyethylene, polypropylene or corresponding copolymer<br>
powders. In particular, polymer powders having a melting point<br>
below 150°C give particularly good results on use of the pastes. For<br>
the preparation of the pastes, corresponding polymer powders can<br><br>
be added in an amount of 1 to 50% by weight, preferably in an<br>
amount in the range from 10 to 50% by weight, based on the total<br>
amount of the composition. Experiments have shown that both the<br>
printing-on of the pastes in the form of very thin lines or extremely<br>
fine structures is possible with a good result if the particles of the<br>
polymer powders used have relative particle diameters in the range<br>
from 10 nm to 30 urn. Particularly good print results are achieved<br>
on use of powders having relative particle diameters of 1 to 10 urn<br>
and if the viscosity of the paste is in a suitable range. The pastes<br>
can be printed very well if they have a viscosity in the range from 20<br>
to 40 Pas. Preference is given to the use of etching pastes which<br>
have a viscosity in the range from 25 to 35 Pas.<br>
Furthermore, a part of the organic polymer powders may be<br>
replaced by inorganic finely particulate powders. Inorganic powders<br>
which can be added are preferably extremely fine graphite or<br>
extremely fine carbon-black powder.<br>
Solvents which may be present in the etching media according to<br>
the invention are those selected from the group water, isopropanol,<br>
diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, 1,2-pro-<br>
panediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, glycerol, 1,5-pentanediol,<br>
2-ethyl-1-hexanol or mixtures thereof, or solvents selected from the<br>
group acetophenone, methyl-2-hexanone, 2-octanone, 4-hydroxy-4-<br>
methyl-2-pentanone, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, ethylene glycol mono-<br>
butyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene<br>
glycol monomethyl ether, carboxylic acid esters, such as [2,2-<br>
butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate, propylene carbonate, in pure form or<br>
in the form of a mixture or mixtures which comprise both solvents<br>
from the first group and also from the second group. The etching<br>
media according to the invention usually comprise solvents in an<br>
amount of 10 to 90% by weight, preferably in an amount of 15 to<br>
85% by weight, based on the total amount of the medium.<br><br>
The etching media according to the invention furthermore comprise<br>
a thickener selected from the group consisting of hydroxyalkylguar,<br>
xanthan gum, cellulose and/or ethyl-, hydroxypropyl- or hydroxy-<br>
ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, homopolymers or copolymers based on<br>
functionalised vinyl units of acrylic acid, acrylates and alkyl meth-<br>
acrylates (C10-C3o), individually or in a mixture in an amount of from<br>
0.5 to 25% by weight, preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, based on<br>
the total amount of the etching medium.<br>
Besides these components, additives selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-control agents,<br>
deaerators and adhesion promoters may be present in an amount<br>
of from 0 to 2% by weight, based on the total amount.<br>
Additives having advantageous properties for the desired purpose are,<br>
for example, commercially available<br>
antifoams, such as, for example, TEGO® Foamex N,<br>
thixotropic agents, such as BYK® 410, Borchigel® Thixo2,<br>
flow-control agents, such as TEGO® Glide ZG 400,<br>
deaerators, such as TEGO® Airex 985 or<br>
adhesion promoters, such as Bayowet® FT 929.<br>
Further additives are mentioned in the following detailed description of<br>
the invention. It goes without saying to the person skilled in the art that<br>
these additives may also be replaced by other commercially available<br>
products with the same action. The essential factor in this connection is<br>
that the addition of such additives improves the product properties.<br>
Additives specifically employed in experiments carried out are also<br>
indicated in the examples given below. These may have a positive<br>
influence on the printability of the etching paste.<br>
Besides the novel etching paste, the present invention also relates<br>
to a process for the selective etching of silicon surfaces and layers<br>
in which the etching medium is applied over the entire area or<br>
selectively in accordance with an etching structure mask specifically<br>
only to the areas of the surface at which etching is desired. After<br><br>
the selected exposure time of 30 s to 5 min at a temperature above<br>
the melting point of the powder particles present in the etching<br>
paste, the etching medium is removed again.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the etching medium acts at a<br>
temperature in the range from higher than 70°C to about 150°C,<br>
preferably higher, but at temperatures lower than 200°C. The action<br>
temperature is preferably set to a temperature higher than the<br>
melting point of the polymer particles added, preferably higher than<br>
150°C, but as far as possible not higher than 200°C. The activation<br>
and setting of the temperature are preferably carried out by input of<br>
energy, particularly preferably by IR radiation.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the etching medium is<br>
applied to the surface to be etched by a screen, template, pad,<br>
stamp, ink-jet or manual printing process or in a dispensing tech-<br>
nique. After the exposure time and after etching, the etching<br>
medium is rinsed off with water or another solvent or with a solvent<br>
mixture.<br>
The etching media according to the invention can be used in pro-<br>
duction processes in photovoltaics, semiconductor technology,<br>
high-performance electronics or display manufacture, in particular<br>
for the production of photodiodes, circuits, electronic components or<br>
for etching silicon surfaces and layers for opening the p-n junction<br>
in solar cells. They can also be used for etching silicon surfaces<br>
and layers for the production of a selective emitter for solar cells,<br>
for etching silicon surfaces and layers of solar cells for improving<br>
the antireflection behaviour, for etching silicon surfaces and layers<br>
in a process for the production of semiconductor components and<br>
circuits thereof, or for etching silicon surfaces and layers in a<br>
process for the production of components in high-performance<br>
electronics.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is for semiconductor surfaces and layers, in<br>
particular silicon surfaces and layers, to be etched or structured over the<br>
entire area or selectively using etching pastes. A technique with a high<br>
degree of automation and high throughput which is suitable for transfer<br>
of the etching paste to the area to be etched is printing and dispensing.<br>
In particular, screen, template, pad, stamp and ink-jet printing proces-<br>
ses and the dispensing process are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art. Manual application, for example by means of a brush and/or appli-<br>
cation roller, is likewise possible.<br>
Depending on the screen, template, klischee or stamp design or car-<br>
tridge or metering unit control, it is possible to apply the etching pastes<br>
described in accordance with the invention over the entire area or<br>
selectively in accordance with the etching structure mask only to the<br>
areas where etching is desired. All masking and lithography steps are<br>
superfluous in this case.<br>
It is thus possible for structuring processes with complex masking or<br>
processes such as laser structuring to be significantly shortened and<br>
carried out less expensively or for processes which are susceptible to<br>
technological faults, such as plasma etching, to be replaced by printing<br>
and dispensing techniques. In addition, the etching process can be sig-<br>
nificantly reduced with respect to the consumption of etching chemicals<br>
since the etching paste is only applied to the areas to be etched.<br>
In particular during parting of the p-n junction in the production of silicon<br>
solar cells, the following advantages can be achieved through the use of<br>
the etching pastes according to the invention:<br>
•	no need for expensive plasma-etching units<br>
•	reduction in the high cell breakage rates that occur<br>
•	minimisation of the high loss of material during mechanical cutting<br>
•	avoidance of surface defects<br><br>
In the production of the selective emitter using etching pastes, it is like-<br>
wise possible to dispense with oxide masking and expensive plasma<br>
etching. In addition, selective application of the etching paste avoids<br>
underetching of the contact areas. Since masking is not required, even<br>
by screen-printed metal contact lines, etching damage to the contacts is<br>
excluded.<br>
It should also be noted that, in contrast to the photolithographic,<br>
plasma-chemical and laser processes used hitherto, the production of a<br>
selective emitter and the improvement in the antireflection behaviour<br>
can be made significantly shorter and simpler with the etching paste<br>
according to the invention. The wafers can be uniformly n++-doped over<br>
the entire area. The areas between the contacts are etched away by the<br>
etching paste, thus n+-doped and improved in their antireflection<br>
behaviour. A plurality of process steps are thus saved.<br>
The etching operation is preferably carried out with the input of energy,<br>
for example in the form of heat radiation (IR lamp) or by means of a<br>
hotplate. When etching is complete, the etching pastes are rinsed off<br>
the etched surface using a suitable solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
The etching duration can be between a few seconds and several min-<br>
utes depending on the application, desired etching depth and/or edge<br>
sharpness of the etch structures and the etching temperature set.<br>
The etching pastes according to the invention have the following com-<br>
position:<br>
•	etching alkaline components<br>
•	solvents<br>
•	thickeners<br>
•	finely divided, low-melting organic powders and optionally finely<br>
divided inorganic powders<br>
•	if desired additives, such as, for example, antifoams, thixotropic<br>
agents, flow-control agents, deaerators and adhesion promoters<br><br>
In order to etch semiconductor elements from main group 4 of the Peri-<br>
odic Table, such as silicon, strong caustic lyes are used in accordance<br>
with the invention [7]. The etching action of the etching pastes<br>
described in accordance with the invention is therefore based on the<br>
use of alkaline, silicon-etching solutions.<br>
The alkaline etching components used in the etching pastes described<br>
in accordance with the invention can be aqueous solutions of inorganic<br>
lyes, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or<br>
organic-based, alkaline etching mixtures, such as ethylenediamine/<br>
pyrocatechol, ethanolamine/gallic acid, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide<br>
or combinations of the two. Particular preference is given to composi-<br>
tions which comprise only sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydrox-<br>
ide. Very particular preference is given to compositions which comprise<br>
sodium hydroxide as etching component. Particularly good etching<br>
results are also obtained if sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide<br>
are employed together in a suitable mixing ratio. This mixing ratio is<br>
advantageously approximately at a KOH : NaOH ratio of 2 : 1. This ratio<br>
may also be shifted somewhat upward or downward.<br>
The proportion of etching components employed is in a concentration<br>
range of 2 - 50% by weight, preferably 5 - 48% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the etching paste. Particular preference is given to etch-<br>
ing media in which the etching components are present in an amount of<br>
10 - 45% by weight. Particularly suitable are etching media in which the<br>
etching component(s) is (are) present in an amount of 30 - 40% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the etching paste, since etching<br>
rates which facilitate complete opening of the p-n junction have been<br>
found for etching media of this type and semiconductor elements can be<br>
treated with high throughput. At the same time, these etching pastes<br>
show high selectivity for the surface layers to be etched.<br>
The etching components are already effective in the etching pastes at<br>
70 - 150°C. However, experiments have shown that improved etching<br>
results are achieved if the temperature is raised rapidly during the etch-<br>
ing operation to just above the melting point of the polymer particles<br><br>
present, so that the etching is preferably carried out at temperatures<br>
above 150°C. The etching with the etching media according to the<br>
invention is therefore preferably carried out at temperatures below<br>
200°C.<br>
As already stated above, both inorganic and organic powders, pref-<br>
erably organic polymer powders, may have been added to the<br>
etching pastes. These powders can be extremely finely particulate<br>
powders comprising polymers selected from the group polystyrene,<br>
polyacrylate, polyamide, polyimide, polymethacrylate, melamine<br>
resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine resin, phenolic resin, silicone<br>
resin, fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF, inter alia), or polyole-<br>
fines, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, and micronised wax,<br>
which, in the molten state, are not miscible with the other compo-<br>
nents of the etching paste, but instead form a two-phase system.<br>
Suitable inorganic powder additions are, in particular, those which<br>
are inert in the presence of strong bases, which are employed as<br>
etching components. Extremely fine graphite or carbon-black pow-<br>
ders can therefore preferably be employed for this purpose.<br>
Polyolefin powders have proven particularly suitable for this use, in<br>
particular polyethylene, polypropylene or corresponding copolymer<br>
powders. Various extremely finely particulate polyethylene powders<br>
may be suitable for this purpose. Both LD-PE powders and also<br>
HD-PE powders can be employed in the pastes. The essential fac-<br>
tors in this connection are the melting point of the polymers and the<br>
fact that a two-phase system forms from the paste composition on<br>
rapid melting.<br>
In particular, polymer powders having a melting point below 150°C<br>
give particularly good results on use in the pastes. For the prepara-<br>
tion of the pastes, corresponding polymer powders can be added in<br>
an amount, based on the total amount of the composition, of 1 to<br>
50% by weight, preferably in an amount in the range from 10 to<br>
50% by weight.<br><br>
Experiments have shown that both the printing-on of the pastes in<br>
the form of very thin lines or extremely fine structures is possible<br>
with a good result if the particles of the polymer powders used have<br>
relative particle diameters in the range from 10 nm to 30 urn. Par-<br>
ticularly good printing results are achieved on use of powders hav-<br>
ing relative particle diameters of 1 to 10 urn and if the viscosity of<br>
the paste is in a suitable range.<br>
It has furthermore been found that a total amount of particles of<br>
50% by weight, based on the composition as a whole, should not be<br>
exceeded in compositions in which both organic polymer particles<br>
and also inorganic particles are present. At the same time, the<br>
content of fusible particles should be sufficiently high that, on heat-<br>
ing above the melting point of the polymer particles, a continuous<br>
polymer layer forms on the printed-on paste on the surface that<br>
terminates the paste to the outside. In the most favourable case,<br>
this is achieved if at least 1% by weight of organic polymer parti-<br>
cles, based on the composition as a whole, are present in the paste<br>
composition. Advantageous conditions exist if the content of organic<br>
polymer particles is higher. Preference is therefore given to the use<br>
of paste compositions in which the content of organic polymer parti-<br>
cles is at least 2% by weight, based on the composition as a whole,<br>
even if inorganic particles are also present in the paste.<br>
The following inorganic or organic solvents, which can be used in pure<br>
form or as a mixture, are suitable for the preparation of the etching<br>
pastes according to the invention:<br>
•	water<br>
•	simple or polyhydric alcohols (for example isopropanol, diethylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, glycerol, 1,5-pentanediol, 2-ethyl-1-hexa-<br>
nol) or mixtures thereof<br>
•	ketones (for example acetophenone, methyl-2-hexanone, 2-octan-<br>
one, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone)<br><br>
•	ethers (for example ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether)<br>
•	carboxylic acid esters (for example [2,2-butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate)<br>
•	esters of carbonic acid (for example propylene carbonate)<br>
Thus, water and the said alcohols can be employed in pure form or as a<br>
mixture. However, ketones, ethers, carboxylic acid esters and esters of<br>
carbonic acid in pure form or as a mixture can also be employed as sol-<br>
vent solvent. Under certain conditions, it may also be appropriate to<br>
employ other mixtures of solvents selected from the various groups.<br>
Preference is given to the use of water and solvents from the group<br>
consisting of the ethers and ketones. .<br>
Water has proven particularly suitable.<br>
The proportion of the solvents in the composition as a whole can be in<br>
the range from 10 - 90% by weight, preferably 15 - 85% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the etching paste. Particularly suitable<br>
compositions have proven to be those in which solvents are present in<br>
an amount of 55 - 75% by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
etching paste.<br>
The viscosity of the etching pastes described in accordance with the<br>
invention is set by means of network-forming thickeners which swell in<br>
the liquid phase and can be varied depending on the desired area of<br>
application. Particularly good etching results are achieved if the viscos-<br>
ity of the etching paste prepared is in a range from 20 to 40 Pas. Pref-<br>
erence is given to the use of etching pastes which have a viscosity in<br>
the range from 25 to 35 Pas.<br>
The viscosity can be determined using a Brookfield rotational viscome-<br>
ter. For this purpose, the viscosity curves are measured at room tem-<br>
perature (25°C) using a spindle (No. 7) at 5 revolutions per minute and<br>
the viscosity is measured under otherwise identical conditions at differ-<br><br>
ent rotational speeds up to 50 revolutions per minute. The viscosity can<br>
be determined more accurately using a cone-and-plate rheometer, for<br>
example an instrument from Haake (Haake RotoVisco 1) or Thermo<br>
Electron Corporation.<br>
For the measurement, the sample is located in a shear gap between a<br>
very flat cone and a coaxial plate. A uniform shear rate distribution is<br>
formed in the measurement gap through the choice of the cone angle.<br>
Control takes place via the number of revolutions (CSR) or the torque<br>
(CSS). Correspondingly, the number of revolutions or torque respec-<br>
tively is measured. The direct stresses can be derived via force trans-<br>
ducers on the drive shaft or on the underside of the cone. In the present<br>
case, the measurement system used was a CP 2/35 system, where the<br>
cone has a diameter of 35 mm and an angle of 2°. For the measure-<br>
ment, a 2.5 g sample is employed in each case. The viscosity curve is<br>
measured automatically under microprocessor control at a temperature<br>
of 23°C with a shear rate in the range 10 - 75 s"1. The average meas-<br>
urement value is obtained from 20 measurements. The standard value<br>
determined is a value at a shear rate of 25 s'1. Corresponding meas-<br>
urement methods are described in greater detail in the standards DIN<br>
53018 and ISO 3210.<br>
If desired, the viscosity can be adjusted by addition of solvent, in the<br>
simplest case by addition of water, and/or other liquid components<br>
and/or other viscosity assistants.<br>
The pastes according to the invention should have a viscosity in a range<br>
from 20 to 40 Pas in order, for example during screen printing, to<br>
ensure a uniform flow through the screen during printing. Since the<br>
pastes according to the invention have thixotropic properties, the<br>
viscosity drops under the action of shear forces, meaning that the<br>
viscosity varies in a certain range for a specific composition.<br>
In particular, the addition of inorganic graphite or carbon-black powder<br>
having relative particle diameters of less than 80 nm, in particular less<br>
than 50 nm, preferably from 45 nm to 30 nm, and a specific BET sur-<br><br>
face area in the range from 40 to 100 m2/g, preferably from 50 to<br>
70 m2/g, gives improved results. Very particular preference is given to<br>
the use of carbon-black powders having particle diameters of about 40<br>
nm and a specific BET surface area of about 62 mg. Thus, the use of<br>
powders of this type having a relative particle diameter of about 40 nm<br>
and a specific BET surface area of about 62 m2/g results in composi-<br>
tions having improved environmental properties; more precisely, it has<br>
been found that the total powder addition can be considerably reduced<br>
for the preparation of a paste having a viscosity of less than 40 Pas, in<br>
particular about 30 Pas.<br>
The pastes according to the invention can be prepared using commer-<br>
cially available graphite or carbon-black powders which have the prop-<br>
erties described above and meet the size and surface requirements.<br>
Mention may be made here by way of example of the commercial prod-<br>
uct Super P™ (conductive carbon black from TIMCAL Graphite &amp; Car-<br>
bon, Switzerland).<br>
The use of carbon-black particles also enables the service life of the<br>
waste-water filters necessary for the removal of suspended particles<br>
from the waste water to be considerably extended, more precisely for<br>
the removal of the suspended particles from the waste water produced<br>
in the rinsing operations for cleaning the etched surfaces.<br>
Surprisingly, measurements have shown that the rinsed-off carbon-<br>
black particles (active carbon) have an adsorptive action for the organic<br>
thickener additives and organic solvent components of the paste. This<br>
has the consequence that the BOD5 value (mg/l) in the rinse water can<br>
be reduced by simple particle filtration. The BOD5 value is the biologi-<br>
cal oxygen demand (mg/l) of waste water in 5 days, measured in accor-<br>
dance with DIN 38409 H51.<br>
The particle sizes, of both the inorganic and organic polymer particles,<br>
can generally be determined using conventional methods. For example,<br>
the particle size can be determined by means of particle correlation<br>
spectroscopy (PCS), with the investigation being carried out using a<br><br>
Malvern Zetasizer in accordance with the instruction manual. The<br>
diameter of the particles is determined here as the d50 or d90 value. The<br>
particle diameters indicated are preferably quoted as d50 values.<br>
The particle diameters can generally be determined by means of laser<br>
diffraction combined with on-line analysis. To this end, a laser beam is<br>
shone into a particle cloud distributed in a transparent gas, for example<br>
air. The particles refract the light, with small particles refracting the light<br>
at a greater angle than large particles. The scatter angle is thus directly<br>
correlated to the particle size. The observed scatter angle increases<br>
logarithmically with decreasing particle size. The refracted light is<br>
measured by a number of photodetectors arranged at various angles.<br>
The measurements are preferably evaluated using Mie light diffraction<br>
theory, which is based on Maxwell's electromagnetic field equation.<br>
This theory is based on two assumptions. Firstly, it is assumed that the<br>
particles to be measured are spherical, but this only really applies to<br>
few particles. The measured laser diffraction is used to calculate the<br>
volume of particles. Secondly, dilute particle suspensions are assumed.<br>
The method usually used to determine particle sizes in the nano range<br>
by dynamic light scattering is described in greater detail in the brochure<br>
"Dynamic Light Scattering: An Introduction in 30 Minutes", DLS techni-<br>
cal note, MRK656-01 from Malvern Instruments Ltd.<br>
The particle size in the nanoparticulate range can also be determined<br>
with the aid of scanning electron photomicrographs (SEM photo-<br>
graphs). To this end, particle-containing emulsions can be prepared<br>
and applied to a suitable surface in an extremely thin layer in a spin-<br>
coating process. After evaporation of the solvent, SEM photographs are<br>
taken and the particle diameters recorded are measured. The relative<br>
particle diameter of the measured sample is determined by statistical<br>
evaluation. Standardised methods for determining particle sizes and<br>
devices suitable for this purpose are described in ISO 13321, Methods<br>
for Determination of Particle Size Distribution Part 8: Photon Correlation<br>
Spectroscopy, International Organisation for Standardisation [(ISO)<br>
1996 (First Edition 1996-07-01)], including methods for determining<br>
sizes in the nm measurement range.<br><br>
Possible thickening agents which are added in order to adjust the vis-<br>
cosity are crosslinked or uncrosslinked homopolymers and copolymers<br>
based on monomer units such as functionalised vinyl units, for example<br>
acrylic acid, acrylates, alkyl methacrylates (C10-C30) and hydroxyalkyl-<br>
guar. The thickeners may be employed individually and/or in combina-<br>
tions with other thickeners. Preference is given to the use of crosslinked<br>
acrylic acid polymers as thickening agents. The sodium salt of car-<br>
boxymethylcellulose (Finnfix®) and in particular crosslinked acrylic acid<br>
homopolymers (Carbomers®) have proven very particularly suitable for<br>
this purpose.<br>
The proportion of thickening agents necessary for the specific setting of<br>
the viscosity range and for the formation of a printable or dispensable<br>
paste is in the range 0.5 - 25% by weight, preferably 1 - 10% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the etching paste. Particularly suit-<br>
able compositions have proven to be those in which thickeners are pre-<br>
sent in an amount of 1.5 - 6% by weight.<br>
Additives having properties which are advantageous for the desired<br>
purpose are antifoams, for example TEGO® Foamex N (dimethylpoly-<br>
siloxane), thixotropic agents, for example BYK® 410 (modified urea),<br>
Borchigel® Thixo2, flow-control agents, for example TEGO® Glide ZG<br>
400 (polyether-siloxane copolymer), deaerators, for example TEGO®<br>
Airex 986 (polymer with silicone tip), and adhesion promoters, for<br>
example Bayowet® FT 929 (fluorosurfactant). These can positively<br>
influence the printability and dispensability of the etching paste. The<br>
proportion of the additives is in the range 0 - 2% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
It has furthermore been found through experiments that both the choice<br>
of the components employed for the preparation of the etching media<br>
and the mixing ratio of the components to one another in the etching<br>
media are of considerable importance. Depending on the manner in<br>
which the etching media are applied to the area to be etched, the per-<br>
centage ratio of the components to one another should be set differ-<br>
ently, since, inter alia, the viscosity and flowability or the thixotropy<br><br>
being set are considerably influenced by the amounts of solvent and<br>
thickener present. The amounts of solvent and thickener present in turn<br>
influence the etching behaviour. Depending on the type of use in the<br>
process according to the invention, it is therefore possible for the person<br>
skilled in the art to select a correspondingly adapted composition of the<br>
etching medium.<br>
For the preparation of the etching pastes, the various components<br>
are mixed with one another successively with adequate mixing,<br>
more precisely in such a way that the temperature is only able to<br>
increase moderately during the addition of the etching component,<br>
but a paste having a suitable viscosity forms during the mixing.<br>
The etching pastes according to the invention can be printed in a known<br>
manner onto the wafer surfaces or semiconductor surfaces and can<br>
even be printed in fine line printing 
ple, through the use of a suitable screen.<br>
Areas of application<br>
The etching pastes according to the invention can be used in:<br>
•	the solar-cell industry<br>
•	the semiconductor industry<br>
•	high-performance electronics<br>
The etching pastes according to the invention can be employed in all<br>
areas where full-area and/or structured etching of silicon surfaces or<br>
layers is desired. Thus, individual structures can be etched over the<br>
entire area or selectively to the depth desired in each case in a silicon<br>
surface or layer.<br>
Areas of application are, for example:<br><br>
•	all etching steps (synonymous with structuring steps), including sur-<br>
face cleaning/roughening of silicon surfaces and layers which result<br>
in the production of optoelectrical components, such as solar cells,<br>
photodiodes and the like, in particular parting of the p-n junction in<br>
silicon solar cells and the partial removal of doped layers (selective<br>
emitters)<br>
•	all etching steps on silicon surfaces and layers which result in the<br>
production of semiconductor components and circuits<br>
•	all etching steps on silicon surfaces and layers which result in the<br>
production of components in high-performance electronics (IGBTs,<br>
power thyristors, GTOs, etc.).<br>
As already mentioned above, it has surprisingly been found that the use<br>
of the alkaline etching pastes according to the invention to which<br>
extremely fine, low-melting organic powders are added makes it possi-<br>
ble to obtain significantly more precise lines or structures with consid-<br>
erably improved edge sharpness. At the same time, it has been found<br>
that the use of NaOH and KOH in a mixture as etching components<br>
makes it possible considerably to improve the average etching rates of<br>
oxidic surfaces, enabling the through-etching of silicon compounds,<br>
such as, for example, phosphosilicate glass, on an industrial scale. The<br>
improved properties and higher etching rates mean that the etching<br>
pastes according to the invention can now also be employed in the<br>
industrial high-throughput semiconductor element manufacturing proc-<br>
ess.<br>
As already mentioned above, investigations of the etching pastes during<br>
and after the etching process with exposure to heat have surprisingly<br>
shown that the low-melting particulate additions present do not mix with<br>
the other components of the etching paste composition on melting, but<br>
instead form an organic phase which floats and settles on the surface of<br>
the printed-on etching paste like a thin layer. The polymer layer or<br>
polymer membrane formed in this way appears to have a considerable<br>
influence on the behaviour of the etching paste and the etching rate,<br>
since the compositions according to the invention are effective over a<br>
longer time with a higher etching rate than comparable, already known<br><br>
compositions which comprise particle-form additions, but do not change<br>
their physical state at temperatures above 150 and below 200°C. In<br>
addition, the polymer layer prevents thin printed-on etching paste lines<br>
from deliquescing during etching and thus resulting in broader struc-<br>
tures.<br>
The object according to the invention is thus achieved by adding<br>
extremely fine low-melting polymer particles to alkaline etching pastes.<br>
At temperatures just above the melting point, the molten polymers form<br>
a polymer membrane on the surface of the printed-on lines or structures<br>
of the etching medium which prevents both evaporation of solvent from<br>
the etching paste and also ingress of moisture. In this way, the etching<br>
action of the now encapsulated etching paste is retained. Surprisingly, it<br>
has now become possible using these etching paste compositions<br>
according to the invention to form etching structures which are narrow<br>
and deep, and also have a complex shape very precisely in surfaces of<br>
solar-cell silicon.<br>
Figure 7 shows a diagrammatic representation of the behaviour of the<br>
low-melting polymer particles during heating and during the etching<br>
process. While a polymer membrane has formed, the etching compo-<br>
nent can become selectively active under the underlying surface.<br>
As has already been established above, heating of the wafer or semi-<br>
conductor element printed with the etching pastes according to the<br>
invention to temperatures above the melting point of the polymer parti-<br>
cles present does not result in an impairment of the etching result, but<br>
instead in a considerable improvement of the properties of the etched<br>
structures.<br>
In order to carry out the etching process, for example, a wafer printed<br>
with etching paste is heated for 2 minutes on a hotplate at about 200°C.<br>
This temperature is preferably selected if the etching pastes used com-<br>
prise polymer particles having a melting point of about 150°C. The<br>
heating to this temperature has, as already described above, the con-<br>
sequence that the polymer particles melt and a second phase forms of<br><br>
the paste on the paste surface, a so-called polymer membrane. This<br>
polymer membrane prevents evaporation of moisture during the etching<br>
process. The mobility of the etching component present is thus main-<br>
tained for longer, enabling a better etching behaviour to be achieved.<br>
In general, the temperature to which heating is carried out during the<br>
exposure time is thus set in such a way that the polymer particles melt<br>
in an extremely short time and an organic layer forms on the surface of<br>
the etching paste as quickly as possible.<br>
After the actual etching step, the etched substrate is returned to room<br>
temperature, with the polymer membrane on top of the etching paste<br>
solidifying and preventing absorption of moisture by the hygroscopic<br>
etching component. The printed-on etching paste thus also retains its<br>
shape in this phase, and lateral spread and rounding of the etched<br>
structure do not take place.<br>
Whereas the diffusion-in of atmospheric moisture on use of known alka-<br>
line etching pastes can result in the etching medium migrating or run-<br>
ning to the opposite side of the wafer in the case of structuring proc-<br>
esses close to the edge, this effect can be completely suppressed on<br>
use of the compositions according to the invention.<br>
The specific composition of the etching pastes according to the inven-<br>
tion, which may comprise NaOH and/or KOH as etching components,<br>
mean that it has become possible to employ them in structuring proc-<br>
esses immediately before immersion into an HF bath, since these com-<br>
positions etch Si layers as well as PSG (phosphosilicate glass from the<br>
n-doping step). In this way, a washing step and a drying step can<br>
advantageously be saved.<br>
Since the use of the etching pastes according to the invention in the<br>
solar cell manufacturing process enables improved etching profiles with<br>
better flank steepness to be achieved, it has also become possible to<br>
print and etch desired structures closer together. This means that space<br>
is gained on the surface of the solar cells.<br><br>
The present description enables the person skilled in the art to apply the<br>
invention comprehensively. In the case of any lack of clarity, it goes<br>
without saying that the cited publications and patent literature should be<br>
employed. Accordingly, these documents are regarded as part of the<br>
disclosure content of the present description.<br>
For better understanding and in order to illustrate the invention, exam-<br>
ples are given below which are within the scope of protection of the pre-<br>
sent invention. These examples also serve to illustrate possible vari-<br>
ants. Owing to the general validity of the inventive principle described,<br>
however, the examples are not suitable for reducing the scope of pro-<br>
tection of the present application to these alone.<br>
It goes without saying to the person skilled in the art that, both in the<br>
examples given and also in the remainder of the description, the com-<br>
ponent amounts present in the paste compositions always only add up<br>
to 100% by weight, based on the composition as a whole, and cannot<br>
go beyond this, even if higher values could arise from the percentage<br>
ranges indicated.<br>
The temperatures given in the examples and description and in the<br>
claims are always quoted in °C.<br><br><br>
The chemicals were weighed into a beaker and mixed using a paddle<br>
stirrer (stirring time 2-4 hours) until a homogeneous, printable paste has<br>
formed. The paste is subsequently transferred into a PE container.<br>
The transfer into containers is carried out after a short standing time.<br>
The present composition gives an etching paste with which, for exam-<br>
ple, silicon surfaces and layers can be etched specifically over the entire<br>
area or in a structured manner down to a desired depth with input of<br>
energy. By means of energy input, a temperature higher than 107°C,<br>
preferably a temperature of about 115°C, is set.<br>
The etching paste is applied to the silicon surface, for example by<br>
screen printing or using a dispenser (for example needle diameter of<br>
260 urn), and etched on a hotplate for 3 minutes at about 115°C. On<br>
production of etching structures with a line width of about 1 mm on an<br>
n-doped (100) silicon wafer, the etching depth determined (depending<br>
on the printing and dispensing parameters) is 0.3 - 1 urn. The etching<br>
depth can be increased by increasing the KOH concentration and the<br>
line width. For line widths of 4 mm and KOH concentrations of 20 - 50%<br>
by weight, the etching depths are 2 - 3 urn.<br>
The etching paste obtained is stable on storage, easy to handle and<br>
printable. It can be removed from the printed surface or layer or from the<br>
paste carrier (screen, doctor blade, template, stamp, klischee, cartridge,<br>
etc.) using a solvent, for example using water.<br>

The etching paste is applied to the silicon surface using a dispenser (pin<br>

145°C. On production of etching structures with a line width of about<br>
1 mm on an n-doped (100) silicon wafer, the etching depth determined<br>
(depending on the printing and dispensing parameters) is 0.2 - 1 urn.<br>

The etching paste is applied to the silicon surface by screen printing or<br>
using a dispenser (pin diameter 450 urn) and etched for 3 minutes at an<br>
etching temperature of 180°C. The etching depth determined on pro-<br>
duction of etching structures with a line width of 1 mm is about 200 nm<br>
on a silicon wafer.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the comparison of the etch depths which can be<br>
achieved under identical conditions in (100) silicon surface using the<br>
etching pastes according to the invention and using previously known<br>
etching pastes without addition of particles.<br>
Example 4<br>
Description of the behaviour of the etching paste according to the<br>
invention<br>
The pastes are applied to the silicon wafers as a frame (very close to<br>
the edge) by means of a dispenser. Each of the two wafers is subse-<br>
quently placed on a hotplate at 200°C for 2 min. during which the silicon<br>
is etched for edge insulation (parting of the p-n junction).<br><br>
The following photographs show a silicon etching paste without addition<br>
of polymer compared with a silicon etching paste with addition of a low-<br>
melting polymer (melting point 
the paste without addition of polymer runs to a significantly greater<br>
extent (surface spread) on the textured silicon surface (the paste has no<br>
protective sheath against atmospheric moisture). By contrast, the paste<br>
with a polymer component exhibits no significant surface spread on the<br>
textured silicon wafer even 30 min after the etching step on the hotplate<br>
(2 min, 200°C).<br>
Strong surface spread is undesired in the mass production of solar cells!<br>
Figures 3 to 6 clearly show the improved behaviour of the etching<br>
pastes according to the invention with respect to precise etching com-<br>
pared with previously known etching pastes without addition of particles.<br>
The figures shown below show the following:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an etching profile produced using a particle-free etching<br>
paste in (100) silicon surface. The etching paste is a SolarEtch<br>
Si etching paste. At an etching duration of 2 min at 200°C, an<br>
etching depth of approximately 1.0 urn and an etched line width<br>
of approximately 500 urn are produced.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an etching profile produced using an etching paste com-<br>
