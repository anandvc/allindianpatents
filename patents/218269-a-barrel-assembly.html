				<td>BARREL ASSEMBLY TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention broadly relates to injection molding machines and, in particular to the injection unit of an injection molding machine. Injection molding machines include machines for injecting plastic material, or metal material, or metal material in a thixotropic state.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Operation of an injection molding machine introduces a number of forces, pressures, and stresses on the injection unit. For example, axial carriage force is a force applied to ,engage the nozzle end of a barrel assembly against a sprue bushing of a mold. This provides a force sealing connection between the nozzle and sprue bushing preventing leakage of melted material during injection. Carriage force is applied and maintained prior to injecting the melt of material.<br>
injection force is a force directed along the length of a reciprocating screw located in a  bore of a barrel assembly. Injection force results in injecting a melt of material into a  mold. There is an axial reactive injection force acting along the length of the barrel assembly as a result of moving a screw forward during the injection stage of a molding process.<br>
Injection pressure, is a pressure required to overcome the resistance to the flow of the melt of material in the nozzle, runner system, and mold cavity. .Injection pressure is exerted on the melt in front of the screw tip during the injection stage of a molding process. The accumulator end of a barrel assembly must withstand injection pressure. .<br>
Injection units for molding  machines are very well known. For example, the book entitled "Injection Molding machines A User's Guide 3rd Edition" by Johannaber was published in 1994 by Carl Hanser Verlag (ISBN 1-56990-169-4) and contains a detailed description  of  conventional  injection  units  for  plastic<br>
injection molding machines in Chapter 3 on pages 38, 39 42, 43, 44,  75,  and 76.   The reciprocating screw (RS)  injection unit includes a barrel assembly which includes a nozzle,  barrel head, barrel,  axial  bore,  feed  port,  heater  bands,  and thermocouples.   A reciprocating screw,  which includes a nonreturn valve, is disposed in the axial bore of the barrel.  The axial bore of the barrel includes a metering section and a feeding section.   An electric or- hydraulic drive operates the screw to feed and meter a melt of material and inject the metered material into a mold.  The barrel assembly is fixed and supported,  cantilevered,  at  one  end  of  the  barrel  by  a carriage. Hydraulic or electric actuators connect between the carriage and a frame member or fixed platen of the injection' molding system.   Operation of the actuators move the barrel assembly  towards  and  away  from  the  stationary platen  and provides an axial carriage force through the entire length of the  barrel  during  injection minimizing  leakage between  the nozzle tip and the sprue bushing.  The axial reactive injection force is directed through the entire length of the barrel during injection.<br>
The book entitled "Injection Molding Operations" "produced by Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd.,  and printed in Canada, copyright  19 8 0  also  contains  a  description  of  conventional injection units for plastic injection molding machines on pages 41 through 44.   Again,  for the reciprocating screw injection unit,  a' barrel -is supported at a distant end by a carriage, which houses the injection cylinder and a rotational drive.  A hydraulic cylinder is connected between the carriage and a stationary platen. ' In operation of the hydraulic cylinder, the carriage  force  is  applied along  the  entire  length  of  the barrel.  For a two stage injection unit, a barrel is supported at one end by a carriage.  The carriage houses the drive.  The nozzle of the barrel feeds into a shooting pot which includes an injection piston.  The carriage supports another end of the shooting pot.   A hydraulic cylinder is connected between the carriage  and' a  stationary  platen.    In  operation  of  the hydraulic cylinder,  the carriage force is applied along the entire length of the shooting pot. The axial reactive injection force is directed through the entire length of the shooting pot<br>
during injection.<br>
United States patent 5,040,589 issued on August 20,  1991 to Bradley et al  (assigned to The Dow Chemical Company) .   The patent describes an injection apparatus for injection molding a thixotropic  semi-solid  metal  alloy.  The  patent  contains  a description of an apparatus for processing a metal feedstock into a thixotropic state as the metal is fed into a hopper, located at one end of the barrel,  and transported into an accumulation zone located at another end of the barrel.   The barrel is constructed of a single piece of material with thick walls.  A number of heating zones are defined along the length of  the  barrel,  including  sections  of  the  barrel  having differing thickness .   The feed throat area and zone 4 are relatively  thick  sections.    Zone  3  is  a  slightly  thinner section, and zone 2 is the thinnest section.   The barrel is conventionally mounted in the injection unit.   A feed throat end of the barrel is mounted in an upright support secured to the frame of an injection unit.   A bottom surface of the barrel, intermediate the distant ends of the barrel, rests on a second support also secured to the frame.   The carriage force is applied along the entire length of the barrel in operation of the apparatus.  All sections of the disclosed barrel must be thick enough to withstand the combination of axial carriage force and axial reactive injection force directed through the entire length of the barrel during injection.<br>
United States patent 5,983,978 issued on November 16, 1999 to<br>
Vining et al (assigned to Thixomat Inc.).  The patent describes<br>
a thixotropic metal injection molding apparatus The barrel is<br>
formed in two sections to define a high pressure section and a<br>
low pressure section.  The low pressure section is thinner than<br>
the high pressure section.  A feed throat end of the barrel is<br>
mounted in an upright support of an injection unit.  A bottom<br>
surface of the barrel,  intermediate the distant ends of the<br>
barrel, rests on a second support also secured to the frame.<br>
The carriage force is applied along the entire length of the<br>
barrel  in operation of  the apparatus.  All  sections of  the<br>
disclosed  barrel  must  be  thick  enough  to  withstand  the<br>
combination of  axial  carriage  force  and reactive  injection<br>
force through the entire length of the barrel during injection.<br>
United States patent 4,863,362 issued on September 5 1989 to Hehl  is  directed  to  an  improved plasticizing  assembly.  In accordance with the invention,  the plasticizing cylinder is arranged  in  a  reinforcing  skeleton,  including  a  track constituted by a track surface of a track bar,  which is spaced from the plasticizing cylinder by radial spacers,  one of the spacers  fixedly connected to  the  track bar and to a rear portion of the plasticizing cylinder and at least one centering spacer  is  connected  to  the  track  bar  and  surrounds  the plasticizing cylinder as a sliding fit and defines a clearance with  the plasticizing cylinder.  Installed in  the  injection unit,  the plasticizing assembly is supported about a middle portion between the legs of a U-shaped bracket that is fixed with  respect  to  the  injection unit  frame;  the  arrangement results in a simple guidance of the plasticizing assembly with the engagement of stationary rollers rotatably mounted in the U-shaped bracket with the track of the skeleton. Further, the portion of the. plasticizing cylinder that protrudes  from a guard surrounding the skeleton is received from the rear as an axial sliding- fit in the bore of a receiving body of the injecting  unit;  in  operation  the  plasticizing  cylinder  is axially force coupled to the injection unit only through its engagement with the receiving body of the injection unit, and hence an axial carriage force acts through the length of the plasticizing cylinder.<br>
Great Britain patent 1297783  issued on November 29 1972 to<br>
Haynes et al is directed, to an injection unit .that eliminates<br>
the  screw non-return valve and  the associated problems  of<br>
manufacture and assembly.   The invention provides an injection<br>
unit  including:  an  injection head with an injection nozzle<br>
installed in a headstock; a plastics feed structure which is<br>
moveable relatively to the injection head and defines therewith<br>
a telescopic injection chamber, the feed structure comprising a<br>
barrel,  a  feed screw rotatable  in a  supply conduit  in  the<br>
barrel which may be connected to a plastics supply source; and<br>
means for moving the feed structure as a unit in a forward<br>
direction relatively to the injection head in performance of an<br>
injection stroke, characterized by the fact that the feed screw has a leading end portion which cooperates with a part of the barrel adjacent the injection chamber' to form a valve by which the supply conduit may be opened and closed, and means are provided to move the screw axially relatively to the barrel to open this valve for filling the chamber with plastics material, and to close it during the performance of an injection stroke.-<br>
There are a number of problems and deficiencies with the known prior art devices. Barrels are costly due to the amount of material required to provide a suitable thickness for withstanding the axial force along the entire length of the barrel. The axial force may be the carriage force, or the reactive injection force, or a combination of these two forces.<br>
Special materials are required for barrels in use with thixotropic materials and these special materials are very expensive and are difficult to manuf iicture.<br>
Thick barrels have a high thermal resistance which affects the efficiency and controllability of heating a material in the axial bore of a barrel.<br>
Barrels,  conventionally mounted in  the  injection unit,  are typically difficult  to  install and remove.   The process of installation and removal within a carriage is time consuming. Installation of the barrel in a carriage is further prone to alignment problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
An embodiment of the invention is initially described referring to Figure 1, which illustrates an injection molding machine, generally indicated  at  10.  . The  injection molding machine includes a clamp unit,  indicated at 12,  interconnected and secured to an injection unit, indicated at 14.<br>
A stationary platen 16 is fixed to a clamp frame member 18 of the clamp unit 12. A moving platen 20 is operable between an open position and a closed position through an actuator 22. Those skilled in the art appreciate that the actuator 22 may be either hydraulic, electric, or a combination of hydraulic and electric actuators. A plurality of tie bars 32 extend between the stationary platen 16 and the actuator 22. A moving half of a mold 24 is mounted on a face of the moving platen 20 and a stationary half of a mold 2 6 is mounted on a face of the stationary platen 16..<br>
The clamp unit 12 of figure 1 is a two platen clamp. Alternatively, the clamp unit 12 may' be a multi-station clamp unit, for example a stack mold carrier, having more than one moving platen and more than one mold. . Alternatively, the clamp unit 12 may be an index clamp unit having a rotating multi-face turret block in place of a moving platen. Alternatively, the clamp unit 12 may be a tandem clamp unit having two molds operated in sequence.<br>
An injection assembly 2 7 is mounted on a injection unit frame 28 of the injection unit 14. The"frame 28 typically houses the control system, electronics, and power pack. The injection assembly 27 further includes a barrel assembly 30, a carriage assembly 34 for supporting and securing the barrel assembly 30, and a drive assembly 36. The drive rotates a screw to create a melt of material and feed the material forward in the barrel into an accumulation zone. The drive also reciprocates the screw to inject the melt of material into the mold.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the drive assembly 36<br>
is further described.   In an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
drive assembly includes both hydraulic and electric components. A screw translation drive 3 8 provides axial movement of the screw (not shown) in the barrel assembly 30. A screw rotation drive -. 40 rotates the screw (not shown) within the barrel assembly 30. The screw translation drive 38 is hydraulic and the screw rotation drive 40 is electric. Alternatively, the drive could be completely hydraulic or completely electric. Activation of the translation drive 3 8 axially reciprocates the screw without rotation of the screw by the screw rotation drive 40.<br>
The barrel assembly 3 0 is mounted and securely retained within the carriage assembly 34. The carriage actuator 42 extends between the carriage assembly 34 and the stationary platen (see Figure 1) . Operation of the carriage actuator 42 moves the injection assembly 2 7 towards and away from the stationary platen for locating the end of a nozzle into contact with a sprue bushing.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, the injection assembly 2 7 is further described. The carriage assembly 34 includes a cradle member 52, a yoke 50.,' and a drive mount 54 for mounting the drive assembly 3 6 (see Figure 1 and 2) .<br>
The barrel assembly 3 0 includes a first barrel portion 44, a first barrel coupler 46, a second barrel portion 48, and a second barrel coupler' 60. The first barrel coupler 46 is disposed on 'the barrel assembly 30 and interlocks with first carriage coupler to secure the barrel assembly 3 0 in the carriage assembly 34. The first carriage coupler is formed intermediate the yoke 5 0 and an end of the cradle member 52 to be described later.<br>
The location of •the first barrel coupler 46 defines a first<br>
barrel portion 44 and a second barrel portion 48 of the barrel<br>
assembly 30.  The first barrel portion 44 is a section of the<br>
barrel that is capable of withstanding injection pressure.  The<br>
second barrel portion 48 is a. section of the barrel that is<br>
isolated from axial forces, both the axial carriage force and<br>
the axial reactive injection force.<br>
The second coupler 50 is disposed on the second barrel portion 48 and communicates with a second carriage coupler located at another end of the cradle member 52, near the drive mount 54, retaining the second portion 4 8 of the barrel assembly 3.0 in the cradle assembly 34. Alternatively the second coupler 60 may be disposed between the first barrel coupler 4 5 and an end of the second barrel portion 48.<br>
The carriage actuator 42 includes a pair of hydraulic actuators indicated as 56 and 58.  One end of the first carriage actuator 5 6 connects to one side of the carriage assembly 34 through a conventional fastener such as a pin  (not shown)  through the openings 51 and 53.   The other end of the first carriage actuator 56 connects to the stationary platen (see Figure 1). One end of the second carriage actuator 5 6 connects to a second side of the carriage assembly 3 4 through another conventional fastener such as a pin (not shown) through the openings 55 and 57.  The other end of the second carriage actuator 58 connects to the stationary platen (not shown).<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, a cross sectional view of the barrel<br>
assembly 3 0 is now further described.   The barrel assembly 3 0<br>
is shown mounted within the carriage assembly 34.  The barrel<br>
assembly 34 includes the first barrel portion 44 and the second<br>
barrel portion 48. . The first barrel coupler 46 is disposed on<br>
the barrel assembly 3 0 and defines . the boundary between the<br>
first barrel portion and the second barrel portion.  The second<br>
barrel coupler 6 0 is disposed at an end on the second barrel<br>
portion 48.  In this embodiment, the first barrel coupler 46 is<br>
integrally formed on the first barrel portion 44 and the second<br>
barrel  coupler 6 0 is" formed onto the outer surface of the<br>
second barrel portion 48.<br>
The  first  barrel  portion  44  includes  a  nozzle  62  and  an<br>
accumulator 64.   The nozzle 62 is mechanically secured by a<br>
plurality of fasteners to an end of the accumulator 64.   The<br>
nozzle 62 seals at the joint 66 with the end of the accumulator<br>
64 preventing leakage of melted material.  An axial bore of the<br>
nozzle  62 aligns with an axial bore of  the accumulator 64<br>
permitting a flow of melt during injection. Alternatively, the nozzle 62 is of unitary construction with the barrel assembly 30.<br>
The second barrel portion 48 is a feed section and is mechanically secured by a plurality of fasteners to another end of the accumulator 64. The second barrel portion 48 seals at the joint 68 at the other end of the accumulator 64. An axial bore of the second barrel portion 48 aligns with the axial bore of the accumulator permitting a flow of melt from the second barrel portion 48 to the accumulator 64. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the first barrel portion 44 and the second barrel portion 48  are of unitary construction without the joints 66 and 68.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5 and 6, two embodiments of a nozzle 62 are described.    The nozzle  62 has an elongate cylindrical section 7 0 extending from a mounting flange 72 to a mold end 86 of the nozzle 62.   The mounting flange 72 is cylindrical and formed integral to the elongate cylindrical section- 70.   The mounting flange 72 has a diameter greater .than the elongate section 70.   The mounting flange 72 includes a plurality of spaced apart bores 74 for receiving mounting bolts (not shown). The accumulator end 7 6 of the nozzle 62 includes a spigot seal 78.   The spigot seal 78 is cylindrical and extends . outwardly from a side of- the flange 72.  The nozzle 62 includes a melt channel made up of a first diameter axial bore 80,  a first concentrator 82,  and a second diameter axial bore 84.   In operation during injection, the melt channel receives the melt from the accumulator through the opening 92 .  The melt travels along the melt channel in the nozzle 62 and exits the nozzle at another opening 94 en route to a mold.<br>
In a  first  embodiment  of  the nozzle  62,  the mold end  86<br>
includes a spigot tip 88.  The spigot tip 88 is cylindrical and<br>
extends  into  a  complimentary  cylindrical  bore  in  a  sprue<br>
bushing (not shown)  for tight sealing engagement between the<br>
mold end 86 of the nozzle 64 and the sprue bushing during<br>
injection of a melt of material.  In operation, the spigot tip<br>
88  is in sliding sealing engagement with the complimentary<br>
cylindrical bore in the sprue bushing.   The spigot tip 88 is permitted to move with respect to the sprue bushing.<br>
In a second embodiment of. the nozzle 62, the mold end 85 includes a convex semispherical tip 90. The semi spherical tip 90 engages a complimentary concave semispherical opening in a sprue bushing (not shown) for tight sealing engagement between the mold end 86 of the nozzle 64 and the sprue bush during injection of a melt of material.

Referring now  to  Figure  7  and  8,  an  accumulator  section, generally  indicated  as  64  is  described.    The  accumulator includes an elongate section 104, and a first barrel coupler 46.  In an embodiment of the invention, the coupler 46 includes an axial force linkage member, indicated as 96, and a thermal isolator, indicated as 98.   Alternatively, the coupler 46 may include a linkage insulator 99 which is an axial force linkage member 9 6 integrated with a thermal isolator 9 8'.  An axial melt channel extends through the accumulator 64.   The axial melt channel  includes  a  first  accumulator  diameter bore  112,  a second concentrator 110, and a second diameter bore 116.   The first accumulator diameter bore 112 aligns and connects with 'the first diameter ; bore 80 of the nozzle 62.   The  second diameter bore 116 aligns and connects with an axial bore 147 of the second barrel portion' 48 (not shown).   The volume defined by the second diameter bore 116 (which defines an accumulation zone) determines the maximum available shot size for injection into a mold.<br>
The accumulator 64 is substantially cylindrical with a suitable wall thickness (between the outer surface of the elongate section 104 and the melt channel) to withstand high pressure due to injection and reactive injection force. In an embodiment of the invention, the wall thickness of the accumulator 64 must also withstand axial carriage force.<br>
The nozzle 62 connects to an end wall 118 of the accumulator 64<br>
through the flange 72 of the nozzle 62.   The end wall 118 of the accumulator 64 includes a plurality of threaded bores 108. The  flange  72  of. the nozzle  62  includes  a  corresponding plurality of bores 74   Bolts interconnect the nozzle 62 to the accumulator 64 by the bores 74 and threaded bores 108.  The bore 114 in the accumulator 64 is of complimentary diameter to tightly  receive  the  spigot  78  of  the  nozzle  for  sealing engagement between  the  nozzle  62  and  the  accumulator  64. .Alternatively,  a  seal,  may be  installed  to prevent  leakage between the nozzle 62 and the accumulator 64.  Heater bands are conventionally secured to an outer surface of the accumulator 64 and the side 126 of the coupler 46.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the coupler 4 6 is integrally formed on an end of the accumulator 64. Alternatively, the coupler 4 6 may be a separate component retained or secured to the accumulator 46. For example, the coupler 46 may be welded to the outer surface of the accumulator 64, or threaded to the accumulator 64. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any retained . or secured connection must be designed to withstand axial forces.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention,- the coupler 46 includes an axial force linkage member 96. For the embodiment illustrated, 'the axial force . linkage member 96 is a pair of outwardly extending members integrally formed on the first . end wall 12 0 of the coupler 46.

By minimizing the cross sectional area of the linkage member 9 6 for contact with a first carriage coupler (not shown) in the cradle member 52.   In operation, the thermal isolator reduces the conductive heat transfer from the hot accumulator 64 and the coupler 46 to the cradle member 52 and the yoke 50. Alternatively,  the thermal isolator may be separate from the axial force linkage member 96, or may be a coating, or may be a different material for reducing the conductive heat transfer. The thermal isolator is disposed intermediate all contacting surfaces between ' the first barrel coupler 4 6 and the first carriage coupler.   Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the thermal . isolator is such to withstand the required axial forces.<br>

Material enters the second portion 48 through the feed throat 140. A screw (not shown) disposed in the axial bore 147 conveys the material forward in the axial bore 147 towards accumulator 64.<br>
The second barrel portion 48 is substantially cylindrical with<br>
a suitable wall thickness  (between the outer surface of the<br>
elongate barrel  and the  axial  bore  147  acting  as  a melt<br>
channel) to withstand pressure developed due to compacting and sheering the feed material. Axial forces are not directed through the second barrel portion 48.<br>
The second barrel portion 48 optionally includes a liner 13 8 'installed within an outer barrel 142 to protect the barrel from abrasiye and corrosive materials.<br>

The end wall 12 0 of the coupler 4 6 includes a plurality of threaded bores 102.   The flange 130 of the second portion 48 includes  a  corresponding  plurality  of  bores  132.    Bolts interconnect the second portion 48 to the coupler 46 by the bores 132 and thread bores 102.  The bore 100 in the coupler 46 is of complimentary diameter to tightly receive the cylindrical  connector 128 of the second portion 48 for sealing engagement between the coupler 46 and the second portion 48.  The bore 122 in the coupler 46 is of complimentary diameter to receive the flange 130.  Alternatively, a seal may be installed to prevent leakage between the first portion and the second portion 48. The  second diameter bore 116 of the accumulator 64 axially aligns with the axial"bore 147 of the second portion 48.<br>
A second barrel coupler 60 is formed on an end of the second portion 48. The second barrel coupler 60 includes at least one engagement member, indicated as 153 for complimentary engagement with a cradle engagement member for preventing rotational movement of the barrel assembly 3 0 during operational rotation of the screw (not shown). Heater bands are conventionally secured to an outer surface of the second barrel portion .48 .<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, the engagement member 153 is a<br>
flat  recess  machined on  the  outer  surface  of  the barrel.<br>
Alternatively,  the engagement member 153 may be an outwardly<br>
projecting  member,  or  a  groove,  or  a  slot,  or  splined.<br>
Optionally, another recess 155 engages a removal plate (not shown) for preventing the barrel assembly from tipping forward when released from the cradle assembly and aligning the second barrel portion vertically with the drive assembly.<br>
In an application of the machine where the melt of material is a metal " in a thixotropic state, for example, magnesium, the nozzle 62 may be made from DIN 2888 or DIN 2999. The accumulator 44 and first barrel coupler 68 (including the axial force isolator) may be made'from Inconel 718 with a Stellite 12 liner. The second portion 48 may be also made from Inconel 718 with a Stellite 12 liner.<br>

described.  The yoke 5 0 is rectangular having a front face 240,<br>
a back face 242, a  left side 244, a . right side 246, top and<br>
bottom. The yoke 5 0 is of suitable thickness to withstand<br>
axial  carriage  force.    The yoke 5 0  includes  a number of<br>
openings 248 for receiving bolts to secure the yoke 50 to the<br>
yoke mounting surface 230 of the cradle member 52. The central<br>
axial bore 250 has a first diameter for receiving the barrel<br>
assembly 3 0 and a second diameter for receiving the barrel<br>
coupler 46.   The coupling surface of the yoke 50 engages the<br>
second axial force linkage member 150.  In an embodiment of the<br>
invention,  the coupling surface is a barrel seat 252 formed<br>
between the first diameter and the second diameter.  The barrel<br>
seat 254 has a cross sectional area to withstand and distribute<br>
axial carriage force.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the first carriage coupler 152 is formed by the yoke .50 and the first carriage coupler 178 of the cradle member 34.<br>
The yoke 50 includes a pair of yoke supports  (254,258) .   A first yoke support 254 is mounted on a side of the yoke 50.  .A second yoke support 258 is mounted on another side of the yoke 50, opposite the first yoke support 254.  The yoke supports are axially  aligned.    The  first  yoke  support  2 54  includes  a supporting surface 25 6 and the second yoke support 25 8 includes a supporting surface 2 60.   The supporting surfaces (25 6, 2 60) engage complimentary surfaces of the first carriage actuator 5 6 and the second carriage actuator 5 8 for supporting the yoke 5 0 during assembly of the' carriage assembly 34.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the yoke is plate steel A36 and the cradle assembly is cast from A536. Alternatively, the cradle assembly may be a pair of couplers interconnected by tie bars.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the first 'carriage coupler is interconnected to the second carriage coupler by a plurality of tie bars. In another alternative embodiment . of the invention, the first carriage coupler is interconnected to the second carriage coupler by frame member.<br>
Installation of the barrel assembly .3 0 in the carriage assembly<br>
52 is described with reference to Figure 18 and 19. The cradle<br>
member 52 is mounted on the frame 28 of the injection unit 14<br>
for axial movement of the injection assembly with respect to<br>
the injection unit frame 28 (not shown).  The carriage actuator<br>
42  is mounted in the cradle member 52  and connected to a<br>
stationary member, for example the stationary platen 16 of the<br>
injection molding machine 10. .  The carriage actuator 42 is<br>
operated to .move the cradle member 52 away from the stationary<br>
platen 16  (see figure 18) .   The yoke 50 is .placed on the<br>
carriage actuator 42 away from the first end 174 of the cradle<br>
member 52. The supporting surface 256 engages one actuator and<br>
the supporting surface 26 0 engages the other actuator.<br>
The barrel assembly 3 0 is lowered into the opening of the cradle member 34. The first barrel coupler 46 is aligned with line first carriage coupler 178. The second barrel coupler 60 is aligned with the second carriage coupler 148. The barrel assembly 3 0 is lowered until the barrel assembly 3 0 engages the first barrel support member 218 and the second barrel support member 2 00. The barrel support members (218, 200) align the barrel assembly 30 in the cradle member 34.<br>
A rectangular retaining plate 2 62 (see figure 19) engages the support surface 155 of the second barrel coupler 60 for retaining the barrel assembly 3 0 vertically in the cradle member 52. The plate 2 62 is secured by conventional bolts to the first and second coupler member (200, 198) . A lower surface of the plate 2 62 engages the support surface 155 permitting axial movement of the barrel assembly 3 0 in the carriage assembly 34.<br>
The yoke 50 is moved towards the first end 174.- of- the cradle member 52 -and secured to the first end 17 4 of the cradle member 52 by a number of bolts. A number of alignment pins and openings are provided between the yoke 50 and the yoke mounting surface 230 for aligning the yoke 50 to the cradle assembly 34. The first barrel coupler 46  is effectively secured and clamped to the carriage assembly. The reciprocating screw (located within the axial bore of the barrel ass.embly) is then connected to the drive assembly 3 6<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that removal of the barrel assembly 3 0 from the carriage assembly 52 is the reverse operation of mounting.<br>
Referring now to Figure 20, the barrel assembly 3 0 and second barrel coupler 60 are shown mounted in the carriage assembly 34 as a top view without the yoke 50.<br>
The second barrel coupler 60 engages the second carriage coupler 148, retaining the second barrel portion 48 of the barrel assembly 30 to the cradle member 52.  The second barrel<br>
coupler 60 and the second carriage coupler 148 prevent the barrel assembly 3 0 from rotating about the longitudinal axis during rotational operation of the screw (not shown). The second barrel coupler 60 and the second carriage coupler .148 permit axial longitudinal movement of the second barrel portion 48 effectively isolating the second barrel portion from axial forces.<br>
Referring now to Figure 21, a partial view of the barrel assembly 3 0 is shown mounted in the carriage assembly 34 as a partial cross sectional view taken along line BB of figure 2.<br>
The barrel assembly 3 0 is housed and secured in the carriage assembly 34. In an embodiment of the invention, the thermal isolator and the first axial force linkage member 96 engages a surface of the first carriage coupler 152. A ring shaped second axial force linkage member 15 0 is located on a other side of the coupler 46. A thermal isolator surface of the second axial force; linkage member 15 0 engages an inner surface (barrel seat) of the yoke 50. The yoke 50 is located at the front of the carriage assembly 34. The yoke 50 is bolted to a forward section of the carriage assembly 34 to securely clamp the first barrel coupler 46.<br>
The clamping force to secure the barrel assembly 3 0 with the carriage • assembly 3 4 is provided between the yoke 50 and the carriage assembly 34. The clamping force is directed through the second axial force linkage member 15 0 (including a thermal isolator), the first barrel coupler 46, and the first axial force linkage member 96 (including a thermal isolator).<br>
In operation, there are two different applications where axial<br>
carriage force is dire:cted through the barrel coupler 46.  When<br>
the nozzle 62 includes a spigot tip 88 (see figure 5), the yoke<br>
includes a first carriage stop 15 6 and a second carriage stop<br>
158  (alternatively,  a single carriage stop).   The first and<br>
second stop are mounted by bolts to a front face of the yoke<br>
50.  The first and second stop extend outwardly from the front<br>
face 2 40 of the yoke 5 0 to engage a surface of the stationary<br>
platen.   The length of the first and' second stop is such to<br>
permit a length of the spigot tip 88 to enter into the sprue<br>
bushing.    Operation of  the  carriage actuator 42 moves  the<br>
carriage  assembly  3 4  and  barrel  assembly  3 0  towards  the<br>
stationary platen 16 (see figure. 1) until the first and second<br>
stop engage the stationary platen 16 preventing further forward<br>
movement.   The carriage actuator 42 is  further operated to<br>
create the axial carriage force.   The axial carriage force is<br>
directed through the first carriage actuator 5 6 and the second<br>
carriage actuator 5 8 to the carriage assembly 34.  The carriage<br>
assembly 3 4 further directs the axial carriage force through<br>
the first carriage coupler 152 to the first axial force linkage<br>
member 96, the first barrel coupler 46, the second axial force<br>
linkage member 150,  the yoke 50,  and the first and second<br>
stops.  This isolates both barrel portions 44 and 48 from axial<br>
carriage force.<br>
Referring now to Figure 22, axial injection force is described. During the injection phase, the screw translation drive 38 is operated to move the screw forward in the barrel assembly 30. An injection force is directed from the translation drive 38 to the reciprocating screw "body 164., and to the melt of material locate'd in front of the reciprocating screw. A reactive injection force is directed back through the accumulator 64, to the first "barrel coupler 46, (including linkage members) to the first carriage coupler 152, to the first and second carriage actuator; housings (17 0, 172) , to the drive mount 54, and to the screw translation drive assembly 30. The second barrel portion is isolated from the axial reactive injection force.<br>
Referring now to Figure 23,  when the nozzle 62 includes a<br>
semispherical tip 90 (see figure 6), the first stop 156 and the<br>
second stop 15 8 are not required.    Operation of the carriage<br>
actuator 42 moves the carriage assembly 3 4 and barrel assembly<br>
3 0 towards the stationary platen 16 unit the semispherical tip<br>
90 engages the sprue bushing.   The carriage actuator 42 is<br>
further operated to create the axial carriage force.  The axial<br>
carriage force is directed through the first carriage actuator<br>
5 6 and the second carriage actuator 5 8 to the carriage assembly<br>
34.    The  carriage  assembly  34  further  directs  the  axial<br>
carriage force through the first carriage coupler 152 to the<br>
first axial force linkage member 96, the first barrel coupler 46, the accumulator 64, and the nozzle 62. The first barrel portion distributes axial carriage force and the second barrel portion is isolated from axial carriage force.<br>
Referring now to Figure 24, axial injection force is described. During the injection phase, the screw translation drive 38 is operated to move the screw forward in the barrel assembly 30. An injection force is directed from the translation drive 3 8 to the reciprocating screw body 164, and to the melt of material located in front of the reciprocating screw.  A first reactive injection force is directed back through the accumulator 64, to the first barrel coupler 46, (including linkage members) to the first carriage coupler 152, to the first and second carriage actuator housings (170, 172), to the drive mount 54, and to the screw  translation  drive  assembly  30.    A  second  reactive injection force is directed back through the nozzle 62 to the accumulator  64,  to  the first barrel  coupler 46,  (including linkage members)  to the first carriage coupler 152,  to the first and second carriage actuator housings (170, 172), to the drive mount 54, and to the screw translation drive assembly 30. The.second' barrel portion is isolated from the axial reactive injection force.<br>
Referring now to Figure 25 and 26, operation of a screw in a<br>
the  barrel  assembly  is  described.    The  barrel, assembly,<br>
including the nozzle 62, accumulator 64,  first barrel coupler<br>
46, second barrel portion 48, and second barrel coupler 60 is<br>
secured and retained respectively in the carriage assembly 34<br>
as previously described.  A screw is located within the axial<br>
bore of the accumulator and the second barrel portion.   The<br>
screw includes a screw tip 16 0,  a check valve 162,  and a<br>
reciprocating screw body 164.   The screw is reciprocatable<br>
between an injected position (see figure 13) and a maximum shot<br>
position (see figure 14).<br>
In operation, the screw starts at the injected position.  Feed<br>
material enters the axial bore of the barrel assembly through<br>
the feed port.   The material is melted and conveyed forward<br>
along the screw body 164 towards the screw tip 160.  As a shot .<br>
of material develops in front of the screw tip 160 in the accumulation zone of the accumulator 64, the screw moves aft until an appropriate shot volume is received in the accumulator zone. Then, the screw is advanced forward injecting the shot of melt into a mold. The check valve 162 permits the melt to move forward, but not backward of the check valve. In operation, the check valve reciprocates only within the axial bore of the accumulator 64.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the barrel assembly is formed by a single unitary. construction. In another embodiment, the barrel assembly is a first section connected to a second section. In another embodiment, the first section is a nozzle connected to an accumulator. In another embodiment, the first section is nozzle connected to a barrel head which is connected to an accumulator.'<br>
