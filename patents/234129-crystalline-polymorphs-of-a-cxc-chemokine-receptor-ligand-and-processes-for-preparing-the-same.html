CRYSTALLINE POLYMORPHS OF A CXC-CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR LIGAND<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present patent application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/540,487, filed January 30, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to crystalline polymorphs of a substituted cyclobutenedione compound, pharmaceutical compositions containing the polymorphs, and methods and formulations in treating CXC chemokine-mediated diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T-cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and endothelial cells to sites of inflammation and tumor growth. There are two main classes of chemokines, the CXC-chemokines and the CC- chemokines. The class depends on whether the first two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid (CXC-chemokines) or are adjacent (CC-chemokines). The CXC-chemokines include interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-1 (NAP-1), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), GROa, GR0f3, GROy, ENA-78, GCP-2, IP-10, MIG and PF4. CC chemokines include RANTES, MIP -1a, MIP-2(3, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-2, MCP-3 and eotaxin. Individual members of the chemokine families are known to be bound by at least one chemokine receptor, with CXC-chemokines generally bound by members of the CXCR class of receptors, and CC-chemokines by members of the CCR class of receptors. For example, IL-8 is bound by the CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 receptors.<br>
Since CXC-chemokines promote the accumulation and activation of neutrophils, these chemokines have been implicated in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Baggiolini<br><br>
et al., FEBS Lett 307, 97 (1992); Miller et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 12,17 (1992); Oppenheim et al., Annu. Fev. Immunol. 9,617 (1991); Seitz et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87, 463 (1991); Miller et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 146, 427 (1992); Donnely et al., Lancet 341,643(1993).<br>
ELRCXC chemokines, including IL-8, GROoc, GRO(3, GROy, NAP-2, and ENA-78 (Strieter et al. 1995 JBC 270 p. 27348-57), have also been implicated in the induction of tumor angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth). All of these chemokines are believed to exert their actions by binding to the 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor CXCR2 (also known as IL-8RB), while IL-8 also binds CXCR1 (also known as IL-8RA). Thus, their angiogenic activity is due to their binding to and activation of CXCR2, and possibly CXCR1 for IL-8, expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in surrounding vessels.<br>
Many different types of tumors have been shown to produce ELRCXC chemokines and their production has been correlated with a more aggressive phenotype (Inoue et al. 2000 Clin. Cancer Res. 6 p. 2104-2119) and poor prognosis (Yoneda et al. 1998 J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 90 p. 447-454). Chemokines are potent chemotactic factors and the ELRCXC chemokines have been shown to induce EC chemotaxis. Thus, these chemokines probably induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells toward their site of production in the tumor. This may be a critical step in the induction of angiogenesis by the tumor. Inhibitors of CXCR2 or dual inhibitors of CXCR2 and CXCR1 will inhibit the angiogenic activity of the ELRCXC chemokines and therefore block the growth of the tumor. This anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated for antibodies to IL-8 (Arenberg et al. 1996 J. Clin. Invest. 97 p. 2792-2802), ENA-78 (Arenberg et al. 1998 J. Clin. Invest. 102 p. 465-72), and GROa (Haghnegahdar et al. J. Leukoc Biology 2000 67 p. 53-62).<br>
Many tumor cells have also been shown to express CXCR2 and thus tumor cells may also stimulate their own growth when they secrete ELRCXC chemokines. Thus, along with decreasing angiogenesis, inhibitors of CXCR2 may directly inhibit the growth of tumor cells.<br>
Hence, the CXC-chemokine receptors represent promising targets for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents.<br><br>
There remains a need for compounds that are capable of modulating activity at CXC-chemokine receptors. For example, conditions associated with an increase in IL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophil and T-cell subsets into the inflammatory site and growth of tumors) would benefit by compounds that are inhibitors of IL-8 receptor binding.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Compound A is disclosed in WO 02/083624 as Examples 360.31 and 405, which reflect the following chemical structure:<br><br><br>
Anhydrous Compound A is particularly active as a CXC-chemokine receptor iigand. A monohydrate form of Compound A was found to have substantially similar activity. Four distinct crystalline polymorphs of a monohydrate of Compound A were found to exist. These four forms are herein referred to as Forms /, //, /// and IV. Each of the four polymorphs is neutral, i.e., in neither ionic nor salt form. The four crystalline forms can be referred to as polymorphs. Since the intended use of this compound is as a therapeutically active pharmaceutical agent, the most stable pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the monohydrate of Compound A will be of great interest.<br>
Polymorphism can be characterized as the ability of a compound to crystallize into different crystal forms, while maintaining the same chemical formula. A crystalline polymorph of a given drug substance is chemically identical to any other crystalline polymorph of that drug substance in containing the same atoms bonded to one another in the same way, but differs in its crystal forms, which can affect one or more physical properties, such as stability, solubility, melting point, bulk density, flow properties, bioavailability, etc.<br>
As used throughout the specification, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:<br>
"Patient" includes both human and other animals.<br>
"Mammal" includes humans and other mammalian animals.<br>
"Polymorph" means a crystalline form of a substance that is distinct from another crystalline form but that shares the same chemical formula.<br>
"Inventive polymorph" means any of the four crystalline polymorphs Forms I-IV of the monohydrate of Compound A, and is not limited to a single polymorph but can include more than one form.<br>
"Alcohol" means an organic compound containing a hydroxyl group (-OH).<br><br>
"Nitrite" means an organic compound containing a -C=N group.<br>
"Excipient" means an essentially inert substance used as a diluent or to give form or consistency to a formulation.<br>
"Effective" or "therapeutically effective" is meant to describe a polymorph of a compound or a composition of the present invention effective as a chemokine receptor ligand and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect. "Effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" is meant to describe an amount of polymorph or a composition of the present invention effective as a chemokine receptor ligand and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect,<br>
Sample Preparation<br>
Forms /-/Vof Compound A were analyzed as a dry powder for powder x-ray diffraction ("PXRD") analyses. Forms I, II and ///were analyzed without first being micronized. Form IV was analyzed after micronization.<br>
A micronizer was used to grind and classify the Form IV material. The micronizer grinds and classifies the Compound A material in a single shallow chamber. Filtered nitrogen is introduced through peripheral jets. These jets are spaced at regular intervals around the periphery of the grinding chamber. During operation, a high-speed vortex is generated, and the Compound A material is injected into the vortex near the peripheral wall. Strong velocity gradients near the jets cause the suspended particles to collide and reduce one another by impact. Heavier oversized particles are held in the grinding area by centrifugal force. The rate of feed and the grinding gas pressure are the main factors that control the output particle size. The grinding gas exits through an outlet at the top center of the chamber and draws the micronized product with it into the collection bag. The Compound A material is collected in double-polyethylene-bag-lined drums. The batch was micronized at a feed rate of 100 g/min and a mill pressure of 40 psig on a 4 inch micronizer.<br>
The samples were analyzed with minimal preparation to prevent any form changes. The samples were lightly rubbed to insure that particles were not<br><br>
agglomerated. No solvents, drying or other preparation steps were used for these analyses. The PXRD data can uniquely identify the polymorphic forms.<br>
Powder X-Rav Diffraction<br>
The Bruker D8 diffractometer (manufactured in 2002) was used in the powder x-ray powder diffraction studies. It has a parallel optic configuration with a GOBEL beam focusing mirror and a Position Sensitive Detector ("PSD") equipped with a fixed radial soller slit was used with an Anton Paar TTK450 temperature stage. The radiation source is copper (Ka). The divergence slits are fixed at 0.6mm. The sample holder was a top-loading brass block. PSD fast scan was used to scan from 3.0° to 69.9°. Specimens were loaded onto the sample holder and leveled with a glass microscope slide. The sample chamber temperature was set at 30°C, under ambient humidity and not purged with nitrogen and not under vacuum. Instrument calibration was verified using mica standards. During scanning, the step size was 0.013 degrees over step durations of 2 seconds. Data analysis was accomplished using EVA analysis software, version 7.0.0.1, supplied by Bruker® written by SOCABIM ®. The data were not smoothed by the software while the peak search was performed with a threshold of 3.<br>
Using the methods and equipment described above, Forms I-IV of Compound A were subjected to PXRD analysis. PXRD patterns were generated and are displayed in FIGS 1 - 4.   The intensity of the peaks (y-axis is in counts per second) is plotted vesus the 29 angle (x-axis is in degrees 20). In addition, the data were plotted with detector counts normalized for the collection time per step versus the 20 angle. Peak locations (on the 29 X-axis) consistent with these profiles are displayed in Table 1.  The locations of these PXRD peaks are characteristic of crystalline polymorphs of Forms I - /Vof Compound A.<br><br><br><br><br>
Starting with PXRD peak locations as displayed in Table 1, the most characteristic peak locations of each polymorph can be selected and grouped by relative intensity to conveniently distinguish the crystalline structure from others.<br>
Such a selection of unique peaks is displayed in Table 2. Thus, for example, the crystalline structure of Form I of Compound A may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 1, consisting of 4 characteristic PXRD peak locations. Alternatively, the crystalline structure of Form I of Compound A may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 2, consisting of the 4 characteristic PXRD peak locations of Group No. 1 and an additional 4 peak locations. Alternatively, the Form I crystalline structure of Compound A may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 3, consisting of the 8 characteristic PXRD peak locations of Group No. 2 and an<br><br><br><br>
of error. Such variation can be introduced by differences in sample preparation, instrumentation, or analytical technique, among other factors. Measurements of individual peak locations can vary to a small degree, but an entire peak profile can vary by a greater degree, due to variations in density of packed samples, for example.<br>
Synthesis of Polymorphic Forms Form I:<br>
Compound A Form I is a neutral form with 1:1 molar ratio of hydrate water. It was prepared by crystallizing amorphous neutral Compound A from a mixture of an alcohol and water, in some embodiments, the alcohol is methanol or ethanol.   The amorphous Compound A was dissolved in a minimum amount of methanol or ethanol at room temperature. Water was added dropwise until the solution became hazy, whereupon the alcohol was added to make the solution clear. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight until solid formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration. The PXRD profile of Form las crystallized from an ethanol/water mixture is displayed in FIG 1.<br>
Compound A Form I was also prepared by crystallizing amorphous neutral Compound A from commercial grade (non-anhydrous) methanol. The amorphous Compound A was dissolved in a minimum amount of methanol at room temperature and the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature and concentrate via evaporation until solid materials formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration.<br>
Form II:<br>
Compound A Form II is a neutral form with 1:1 molar ratio of hydrate water. It was prepared by mixing Compound A Form I in an organic solvent as a slurry at room temperature. In some embodiments, the organic solvent is methylene chloride or acetone. Conversion to Form //occurs spontaneously. The PXRD profile of Form II as crystallized from a slurry of Form /and methylene chloride is displayed in FiG 2.<br><br>
Form III:<br>
Compound A Form III is a neutral form with a 1:1 molar ratio of hydrate water. It was prepared by crystallizing Compound A amorphous neutral form from a mixture of an organic solvent and water at elevated temperature. Preferably, the organic solvent is n-propanol. The procedure is described below:<br>
About 6 g of amorphous, unmicronized Compound A solid was dissolved in 45 mL n-propanol by warming in a heating mantle under a nitrogen atmosphere. About 80 mL of water was added portion-wise until precipitation was detected. Another 20 mL of n-propanol was added to the slurry and the mixture was heated to 70 °C The heating mantle was removed and a precipitate formed. The slurry was stirred overnight and filtered and washed with 4:1 H2O/n-propanol. The solid was dried in vacuo at 40 °C. The PXRD profile of Form III as crystallized from amorphous, unmicronized Compound A and a mixture of n-propanol/water is displayed in FIG 3.<br>
Form IV:<br>
Compound A Form IV is a neutral form with a 1:1 molar ratio of hydrate water. It was prepared by mixing Compound A Form I in either acetonitrile or n-propanol as a slurry at room temperature. Conversion to Form IV occurs spontaneously. In large scale, it was prepared by the procedure described below:<br>
To a 5 Liter, three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, and reflux condenser, was charged 200 g of Compound A neutral form monohydrate, 2.2 L of n-propanol and 2.0 L of water. The suspension was agitated and heated up to 70°C to dissolve all solids. The solution was then cooled to 60°C and Form IV seeds were charged (about 0.5 g). The mixture was stirred at a temperature between 58 and 60°C for 4 hours while allowing the product to precipitate. The mixture was then cooled to 50°C over one hour and agitated at this temperature over night. The batch was further cooled to a temperature between 5 and 10°C over three hours. The product was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C for 10 hours. The recovery was 180.4 g (90.2%). The PXRD analysis is displayed in FIG. 4 and shows pure Form IVcrystals.<br><br>
In the above procedures for the preparation of Forms III and IV, the form of Compound A used as the starting material can alternately be amorphous, Forms HV, or any combination thereof.<br>

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer, comprising administering, concurrently or sequentially, an effective amount of at least one of the polymorphs disclosed herein and a microtu bule affecting agent e.g., paclitaxel.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a m ethod treating cancer, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof, concurrently or sequentially, a therapeutically effective amount of (a) at least one of the polymorphs disclosed herein, and (b) an antineoplastic agent, microtubule affecting agent or anti-angiogenesis agent.<br>
As used herein, a microtubule affecting agent is a compound that interferes with cellular mitosis, i.e., having an anti-mitotic effect, by affeoting microtubule<br><br>
formation and/or action. Such agents can be, for instance, microtubule stabilizing agents or agents that disrupt microtubule formation.<br>
Microtubule affecting agents useful in the invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to allocolchicine (NSC 406042), Halichondrin B (NSC 609395), colchicine (NSC 757), colchicine derivatives (e.g., NSC 33410), dolastatin 10 (NSC 376128), maytansine (NSC 153858), rhizoxin (NSC 332598), paclitaxel (Taxol®, NSC 125973), Taxol® derivatives (e.g., derivatives (e.g., NSC 608832), thiocolchicine (NSC 361792), trityl cysteine (NSC 83265), vinblastine sulfate (NSC 49842), vincristine sulfate (NSC 67574), epothilone A, epothilone, and discodermoiide (see Service, (1996) Science, 274:2009) estramustine, nocodazole, MAP4, and the like. Examples of such agents are also described in the scientific and patent literature, see, e.g., Bulinski (1997) J. CellSci. 110:3055-3064; Panda (1997) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 94:10560-10564; Muhlradt (1997) Cancer Res. 57:3344-3346; Nicolaou (1997) Nature 387:268-272; Vasquez (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:973-985; Panda (1996) J. Biol Chem. 271:29807-29812.<br>
In some embodiments, the agents are compounds with paclitaxel-like activity. These include, but are not limited to paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives (paclitaxel-like compounds) and analogues, Paclitaxel and its derivatives are available commercially. In addition, methods of making paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives and analogues are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729; 5,565,478; 5,530,020; 5,527,924; 5,508,447; 5,489,589; 5,488,116; 5,484,809; 5,478,854; 5,478,736; 5,475,120; 5,468,769; 5,461,169; 5,440,057; 5,422,364; 5,411,984; 5,405,972; and 5,296,506).<br>
More specifically, the term "paditaxeF as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol® (NSC number: 125973). Taxol® inhibits eukaryotic cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper structures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (Hawkins (1992) Oncology, 6:17-23,<br><br>
Horwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 13:134-146, Rowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Cane. Inst. 82:1247-1259).<br>
Additional microtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many such assays known in the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see Lopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47).<br>
Generally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disrupted, in particular, through the inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disruption of normal spindle formation. Cells in which mitosis is interrupted may be characterized by altered morphology {e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).<br>
Compounds with possible tubulin polymerization activity can be screened in vitro. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by Porter (1995) Lab. Anim. ScL, 45(2):145-150.<br>
Other methods of screening compounds for desired activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically such assays involve assays for inhibition of microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, by Gaskin et at. (1974) J. Molec. Biol., 89:737-758. U.S. Patent No. 5,569,720 also provides in vitro and in vivo assays for compounds with paclitaxel-like activity.<br>
Methods for the safe and effective administration of the above-mentioned microtubule affecting agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians' Desk Reference" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ<br><br>
07645-1742, USA); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the inventive polymorphs and the chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the disease being treated. A dosage regimen of the inventive polymorphs can be oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, more preferably 50 to 600 mg/day, in two to four (preferably two) divided doses, to block tumor growth. Intermittent therapy {e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used.<br>
The chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered according to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents (i.e., antineoplastic agent or radiation) on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the disease to the administered therapeutic agents.<br>
In the methods of this invention, the inventive polymorph is administered concurrently or sequentially with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation. Thus, it is not necessary that, for example, the chemotherapeutic agent and the inventive polymorph, or the radiation and the inventive polymorph, should be administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously. The advantage of a simultaneous or essentially simultaneous administration is well within the determination of the skilled clinician.<br>
Also, in general, the inventive polymorph and the chemotherapeutic agent do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the inventive polymorph may be administered orally to<br><br>
generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.<br>
The particular choice of an inventive polymorph, and chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>
The inventive polymorph, and chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered in conjunction {i.e., withir a single treatment protocol) with the inventive polymorph.<br>
If the inventive polymorph, and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the initial order of administration of the inventive polymorph, and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, may not be important. Thus, the inventive polymorph may be administered first, followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation; or the chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administere first, followed by the administration of the inventive polymorph. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determinatioi of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.<br>
For example, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continue with the administration of the inventive polymorph followed, where determined<br><br>
advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete.<br>
