3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Description<br>
The invention concerns a web guiding device for a textile machine with a draft system for the compaction of a fiber web, which is leaving the said draft system in an expanded condition, with an inlet section and a subsequent outlet section, which outlet section possesses a cross-sectional area less than that of the inlet section. Simultaneously the invention concerns a textile machine with a web guiding device as described.<br>
Guide devices of the type described above are well known in carding, stretching and combing machines. In the case of the known stretching machine RSB-D 35 of the firm of Rieter, for example, a sliver funnel, which extends itself to the width of the web, is located somewhat remote from the inlet section. This funnel possesses a concave, inwardly curved impact surface, the lowest location of which forms a tube, which reduces itself to a small diameter conduit. This sliver funnel for is frequently designated as a web funnel. Elongated in design, a web guide outlet, can be inserted in the said sliver funnel, as this terminates and the web releases itself through the outlet thereof. At this point, the said unwoven guide outlet transports the unwoven to a subsequent band funnel. The band funnel discharges at its outlet end into a clearance between paired, end-placed, calender rolls, whereby the unwoven fiber band is compacted therebetween and at the same time drawn out of the band funnel.<br>
A disadvantage in the case of this known construction, is that the fibers, which lie more outwardly in the cross-section of the web, are not conducted directly into the web guide outlet after leaving the draft system. More disadvantageously, these once-outer fibers strike at great speed against an impact surface of a sliver funnel, are thereby crimped and are then diverted from said guide device. This abrupt impact first, disturbs the previously precisely drawn fiber web and second, retards the said outward fibers in the web so they are a considerable distance behind those fibers which lie more inwardly, and which are now transported directly to the said web outlet. By this means, in a highly undesirable manner, the fibers of the web are once again colliding against one another. The result is that the parallel order of the fibers is impaired, particularly in the case of combed fibers.<br>
Consequently, it is the purpose of the invention to develop a web guiding device, of the kind described in the opening passages, which enables a protective transport for webs from the output of the draft system to the drawing apparatuses (for instance, calender rolls) without, as far as possible, the generation of band disturbances within the web.<br>
2<br><br>
This purpose is achieved through the web guiding device according Claim 1.. A textile machine, in accord with the invention, characterizes itself by possessing a web guiding device functioning in this manner.<br>
With the invented web guiding device the outer fibers of the web are guided to the outlet section following a more direct path, that is to say, with lesser diversion, than is the case of the fibers lying further inward. Preferably, in this matter, all fibers of the web are guided by at least one guide surface toward the outlet section, so that even the inward lying fibers are properly directed, although not transported along the most direct path. The inward situated fibers are thus not transported through the shortest distance from the outlet rolls of the draft system, that is to say, from a turnaround upper roll to the outlet section and further into a web guide outlet or a band funnel.<br>
Taken as a whole, accordingly those of the fibers lying further inward in the web pass through a distance which has been artificially lengthened, whereby a displacement of the order of the fibers of the web between the draft system output and the calender rolls is held to a minimum, or, indeed, entirely avoided. Accordingly it is of value, to guide the outward lying fibers on a nearly direct path or in a slightly bowed curve to the outlet section, while the central fibers, which find themselves in the middle zone, conversely follow a more delaying, longer bowed path.<br>
[f the draft system is laid out to be horizontal or inclined the running direction of the web leaving the draft system is inclined in relation to the axis of the following band funnel, while the band funnel is vertical. According to this invention the at least one guiding surface is concave between the inlet and the outlet section, so that it attains the corresponding path curvature and the fiber disorganization of the web width is at least partially avoided, or, in a particularly preferred case, fully avoided<br>
By means of the invention, first, the excellent draw quality of the web at the outlet of the draft system and second, making the fibers parallel as they leave the said draft system remain intact. As a whole, the invention enables the formation of a fiber band which is of greater uniformity than would be the case if the state of the technology had been followed..<br>
In accord with an advantageous embodiment, the at least one guide surface is so designed, that the individual distances of all of the fibers from the outlet of the draft system up to the outlet<br>
3<br><br>
section are essentially equal, so that no disorganization of the fibers occurs after leaving the draft system. In order to reach this condition, mathematic modeling was carried out. The result showed, that as an appropriate shape, the guide surface can have a curved approach similar to that the inside a mussel shell, in order that the requirements of equally long travel distances might be attained. Advantageously, in its connection to the outlet rolls of the draft system, the receiving guide surface extends itself to conform to the entire width of the web. In accord with a possibly available turning section of the guide surface, in order to direct the web from the outlet of the draft system into the direction of the calender rolls, the side sections of the guide surface, essentially run exactly toward this outlet section. Conversely to this, the corresponding surface section for the inner lying fibers is designed to be more concave, that is to have a greater internal curvature, wherein the most extreme internal contouring is reserved for the central fibers, i.e. those fibers situated in the middle of the web cross-section.<br>
Advantageously, the web guiding device is placed, or can be placed directly behind the last draft system rolls, that is, the last draft system roll pairs. In this way, after leaving the draft system, an immediate guiding control of the fibers can be effected.<br>
If the at least one guide surface is designed to be essentially continuous, i.e. an unbroken surface is to be formed between the inlet section and the outlet section, it becomes possible to establish a continual guidance of the fibers.<br>
A protective fiber guidance is found to be improved, if the fibers are directed into the essentially tangential guide surface in the area of the inlet and then - in accord with its positioning relative to the web width - are transported to the outlet section. Thereby, disturbances of the well ordered, precisely drawn fiber-web are avoided.<br>
In a preferred manner, the fibers can be run between at least two guide surfaces, whereby these can be set opposite to one another or be sequentially arranged in the running direction of the web. In an embodiment incorporating this embodiment, at least a part of the web is on the one guide surface, and subsequently can be run along the other guide surface. In the case a named, vertically designed draft system, for example, especially the inner fibers of the web are conducted over a contoured guidance surface and thereby diverted out of the path to the band funnel, until they are once again directed along their original path by means of a downstream situated guide surface.<br>
In the case of an arrangement contrary to the conventional vertical draft system, which are inclined relative to the vertical band funnel axis, that is to say, a horizontal draft system, there are guide surfaces advantageously designed and installed, wherein at least the innermost fibers are directed during more rapid delivery speeds essentially along a concave shaped guide surface, and during lower delivery speeds, essentially along a convex guide surface.  In the case of the<br>
4<br><br>
said higher delivery speeds, for instance, at more than 300 m/min, then the inner fibers, as they leave the draft system, are conducted along the concave surface. Upon lower speeds, for instance, up to 300 m/min, the inner fibers are not diverted against these concave guide surfaces, but would be moved in a more direct path to the web outlet. On this account, it is of advantage, to turn away these fibers during the said lower delivery speeds from the other side. For this case, the inner fibers are guided along the convex guide surface and in accord with the invention arrive in this manner at the outlet section.<br>
The inlet section and the outlet section as well as the at least one guide surface, in accord with an advantageous embodiment, are constructed as entirely of one piece. A multipiece design is available, if more than one guide surface is being provided. In this matter, it is possible that individual parts of the web guiding device, for example, can be separated from each other, so that, for instance the fiber reinsertion process for web ends is made easier.<br>
In accord with an advantageous embodiment, provision has been made, that the at least one guide surface can be changed in its position. In this way, it is possible, during low delivery speeds, to run the web over the said convex guide surface, which then, upon the presence of higher speeds, can be pivoted away. This measure can help in preventing a formation of air turbulence, or stoppages of the apparatus with fiber material. Also, it is possible that an easier reinsertion of the fiber end can be realized, if the cross-section for reinsertion is temporarily enlarged by means of the said position change of the at least one guide surface.<br>
Advantageously, such a position change can be carried out by means of a pivoting mechanism. Further, it is possible that in an advantageous manner a control apparatus can be provided, which, governed by the delivery speed, issues a directive for a specific positioning of the guide surface.<br>
Alternatively or additively, the web guiding device can be so designed, that it is pivotal. The pivoting can be total or only a part thereof may be swung away. This could occur in the case of band jamming and/or where a windup occurs at one of the outlet rolls. The said pivoting would aid in enhancing accessibility to elements downstream in line to the web guiding device, for example, a web outlet means or a band funnel, or for the purpose of reinsertion during an operational hold during a maintenance stoppage.<br>
Further, openings can be provided, which can be used for the release or the introduction of air. For example, it is possible that these openings can be made very small and provided with suction, in order to assure a uniform inlay of the fibers along the guide surface. Otherwise, openings can be used, in order to provide the fibers with a motion component in the direction of the outlet section. It is also possible to make provision, that in a given section, openings for air inlet passage can be realized, or again in another section, openings for the removal of air can be<br>
5<br><br>
installed. Openings can be further made use of , in order to hinder the establishment of air turbulence within the web guiding device.<br>
Advantageously, the web guiding device encompasses fibers, at least area-wise, more than 180° and in another, advantageous embodiment, this can be, again area-wise, a total encompassment. Particularly in the transfer zone from the outlet section to a subsequent web outlet means or a following band funnel, it is of advantage, that the web guiding device be placed generally around the consolidated fiber web.<br>
The invented web guiding device is designed, advantageously, in the shape of a funnel, that is, it is built around a funnel-like object. Funnel construction is in accord with the introductory description in the opening passages and has the purpose that fiber web, as it leaves the draft system, is to be compacted and in accord with practice, is to be conducted to a subsequent web outlet device and/ or band funnel. An appropriate outlet conduit for this function can be integrally combined as a component with a subsequent band funnel. This combination, in accord with another advantageous embodiment, can be incorporated within the invented web guiding device.<br>
Advantageously, the at least one guide surface is free of fiber snagging, that is to say, is designed to be, so far as possible, free of friction in order to avoid the accumulation of stray fiber and also to assure an undisturbed, uniform operation. On this account, construction materials are preferred, which are of low frictional characteristics, which could have, for instance, guide surfaces having enamel coatings or being made of polished stainless steel. The appropriate construction material is preferably free of abrasion and shredding.<br>
In addition, the invention encompasses, a textile machine with a draft system, which includes a web guiding device in accord with the foregoing description. Based on the invented guidance of the fibers, it is possible that an upper turn-around upper roll can be dispensed with, although these are included by the majority of usual stretch machines. The turn of web, i.e. the change in direction, in accord with the invention, can be completely undertaken by the at least one guide surface.<br>
Advantageous improvements of the invention are characterized in the subordinate claims.<br>
In the following, the invention is explained in more detail with the aid of the drawing.<br>

In Fig. 1, is presented in a schematic, sectioned profile view a horizontal draft system 1 with roll pairs which follow one another. From an inlet roll pair, comprised of an inlet under roll 2 and an inlet upper roll 5 follows a midsection roll pair with a middle under roll 3 and a middle upper roll 6. These two roll pairs form the so-called predraw field, which attaches itself to a following main draw field, which is comprised of the said middle roll pair and an outlet roll pair, having an outlet under roll 4 and an outlet upper roll 7. In the main draw field is placed a hollow connection conduit 8, which serves for the removal of non-consolidated, air-borne fibers in the main draw field. The fibers to be drawn in the draft system 1 are designated by the letter V. One or more fiber bands B in an expanded condition can be introduced into the draft system 1. The draft system can be a part of a machine for carding, stretching or combing. The invention is independent as to whether or not the draft system 1 is to be under automatic control.<br>
Following the draft system 1 is to be found an invented web guiding device 20, in accord with a first embodiment, which is illustrated in a perspective view in Fig. 2. This web guiding device 20 is constructed in two parts, these being first, a funnel 21 and second, a spherically<br>
7<br><br>
curved body 31, whereby the said curved body 31 extends itself into the funnel 21 approximately in the middle thereof. The funnel 21, which in Figs. 3 to 5 is more exactly depicted, is designed to be open to the draft system 1 and possesses on both sides rising edges 27a, which are bound with an upper edge section 27b, this running essentially in a straight line. On the edge at the lower side, the funnel 21 possesses a recessing 27c, through which runs a double-bowed holder 35 for the said body 31. As a whole, this results in a compacted appearance of the funnel 21, which possesses a wide inlet section 22 for the reception of the web fiber V being released by the draft system 1. On the other end of the funnel 21 is to be found an outlet section 24, which, in the embodiment shown, is designed to be circumferentially closed and a has a circularly round cross-section. It is possible that also other cross-sectional forms could be chosen, for instance, an elliptical shape.<br>
Specially, it is to be inferred from the profile view of Fig. 5, as seen from the left of the drawing, that the back wall of the funnel 21 is designed to run concavely inward to the outlet section 24.<br>
As an alternative, the back wall can also be vertical or it may bulge inward (convex), whereby, possibly, turbulences in the outlet section 24 would be reduced, which otherwise could cause a twist in the fiber web.<br>
The inlet section 22 is bound to the outlet section 24 by means of a continuous guide surface 23 of the funnel 21. The said guide surface 23 is so designed, that by means of the width of the inlet section, fibers, which are in the funnel 21 en route to the outlet section 24 are caused to travel through essentially equal distances. The fibers of the fiber web V, under these circumstances - providing a sufficiently high delivery speed is provided - are guided along the inner surface (see the dotted line in Fig. 1). The design of the guide surface 23, besides the above, is such that the more inward situated fibers of the fiber web V are more sharply diverted in their path than are the outward lying fibers. Although those fibers, which are lying entirely outward follow a nearly direct path from the inlet section 22 from outside inwardly to the outlet section 24, the middle situated, i.e., the inner positioned fibers, are forced into a curved path. As a result, those fibers, which, due to the width of the web enter the inlet section 22, also, in an ideal situation, reach the outlet section 24 simultaneously.<br>
The foregoing operational methods also apply if the web is released from the draft system 1 at a relatively higher speed and on this account transports itself to the guide surface 23. In this case the web first runs into the funnel 21 essentially parallel to the guide surface thereof in the area of the inlet section 22, and then is smoothly guided into the outlet section 24. When the delivery speeds are lower, then the speed-impulse imparted to the web V does not suffice to impel the web V to the guide surface 23.   Much more, the web slides, in this case, along the<br>
8<br><br>
oppositely disposed, convex designed guide surface 33 of the body 31 (see dotted line in Fig. 1) to reach the outlet section 24.<br>
The holder 35 for the spherically curved body 31, possesses at its foot a slot 36 for the receipt of a screw (not shown), by means of which the relative position of the body 31 to the funnel 21 becomes adjustable (see double fi in Fig. 1). The thereby adjustable engagement depth of the body 31 in the funnel 21 defines that instant, when the web V is no longer supported by the guide surface 33.<br>
Further, in Fig. 2, the funnel 21, as seen below the outlet section 24, is supported by a broadened foot 25, the underside of which rests on a plate 9. The fastening screws for this attachment are not shown. On both sides of the plate 9 are installed side flanges 10, which are desingated on the bottom side by having recesses 11. These recesses 11 can, respectively, can be fitted with (not shown) a permanent axle of a lower carrier, so that the plate 9 becomes pivotal, of value during a band stoppage in the web guiding device 20. The pivoting direction is indicated by the double arrow f2 in the Figs 1 and 2.<br>
On the underside of the foot 25 of the funnel 21 are provided four air escape passages 26. These passages 26 run horizontally in all four directions, lead to the outside and aid in the release of the air, which is displaced during the compression of webs. The said air escape passages are designated by the arrows f3 in the Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Air from the web, which is continually under increasing pressure in its direction of travel, can also be released by means of opening 26a (Fig. 1) between the recess 27c and the holder 35. (See also arrow U in the Figs. 1,2.)<br>
Beneath the plate 9 a web outlet 12 is aligned with the outlet section 24, which conducts the consolidated web V to a (not shown) band funnel.<br>
Contrary to the web carried in a horizontal arrangement, _in Fig. 6 is a draft system 1, which is inclined downward. In other characteristics, this arrangement is similar to the draft system 1 of Fig. 1. It is a condition of this construction, that the web guiding device 120 possesses a different geometry than do those in accord with the Figs. 1-5. The funnel 121 is more exactly depicted in a perspective view in Fig. 7 as a component of the web guiding device 120. This funnel 121 is bulged as is the funnel 21 in the Figs 1-5, but in a reduced scale, however, its construction, in principal, is quite the same. The inlet section 122, which extends itself over the width of the web, tapers itself nearly linearly down on both sides to the outlet section 124. However, from the midpart downward, the guide surface 123 is contoured to increase in the degree of concavity. In the Fig. 6, additionally is provided a flat, curved constructed insert 131, which penetrates into the funnel 121 and serves for the guidance of such fibers which move in a slower delivery speed (for instance, less than 300 m/min). In case the said body 131 is not present, then the funnel 121 is the sole operational element of the web guiding device 120.<br>
9<br><br>
Situated subsequent to the web guiding device 120 is a web conduit 12 which delivers to a band funnel 14 thereto attached. Further, provided on the side, downwardly inclined toward the middle of the band funnel, are openings 13, through which air can escape from the web V, during its compression. Also other possibilities exist for air release, for instance, at the inlet of the said outlet 12 and immediately upstream thereof in the web guiding device 120. These are denoted by arrows. In the band funnel 14 (and also before this) it is possible (but not shown here) in a known manner to provide further openings, which would be subjected to compressed air, for the purpose of imparting to the web an impulse in the downstream direction. This measure supports the reentry manipulations of a web end in a reentry procedure. In Fig. 6 the band funnel 14 is followed by a pair of calender rolls, 15,16, which in a known manner, serve for the drawing of the web V through the web guiding device 120 and also for the continued transport of the resulting bands to a band channel and finally to a can for spinning material.<br>
In the case of the circumferentially closed funnel 121, which is presented in Fig. 7 in a detailed way, fictional lines 128 have been drawn in the flow direction of the web on the guide surface 123. These lines 128 are all essentially equal in length and symbolize - independently of their position across the width of the web - generally path of equal lengths.<br>
Where the embodiment can be easily changed as seen in the funnel 121 of Fig. 8, (the third embodiment) which shows a circumferentially unclosed funnel, openings 129 are provided in the guide surface 123. Again, as in the air-release channels 26 in accord with the first embodiment, these serve for the outlet of air expressed from the fiber web. Alternatively - according to the application - or additionally, compressed air can be injected through these said openings, which again aids the reinsertion procedure of the end of a web.<br>
In the Figs. 9 and 10, is presented a fourth embodiment of the invented web guiding device. This operates especially well in the case of vertically erected draft system, for which, in Fig. 9, principally, the outlet roll pair 4, 7 are constructed. The web guiding device 220 - here transparent - immediately follows this said roll pair, 4, 7, which said device 220 in this case is designed as one-piece construction and possesses, in the direction of movement of the web, an extended, slightly tapered shape. The web guiding device 220 presents to the rolls 4, 7 a widened inlet section 222, in order that the web V can be accepted therein in its total breadth. On the other end, is a cross-section of a round outlet section 224 to which - similar to the design of Fig. 6 -there follows a web outlet connection 12, a band funnel 14 and calender rolls 15,16.<br>
From the perspective view of Fig. 9, as well as the longitudinally and centrally sectioned profile view of the Fig. 10 may be inferred, that the web guiding device 220 possesses on a longitudinal wall a guide surface 233, which is curved into the flow and along which the inner<br>
10<br><br>
lying fibers of the web V run without turbulence, in order to be turned away from their vertical path (see dotted lines in Fig. 10). The farther outside the fibers he, just so little are they turned away from the plane of the web. The outer fibers are subjected to no turning in the direction of the opposite wall, but are nearly linearly conducted to the outlet section 224 (see dotted lines in Fig. 10). The zone, which is available to the web in the interior of the web guiding device 220, is presented by dotted lines in the Fig. 9 and 10 (likewise as in the Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
In the sectional view in accord with the Fig. 10, it can be seen, that the more inward lying fibers of the web are conducted first to the to the guide surface, which is to be found rising directly under the discharge opening of the rolls 4, 7. In the following connection, these fibers migrate directly to the opposite wall, which is designed again as a guide surface, so that that the said fibers may reach the outlet section 224. Even in the case of this embodiment, the paths measured from the inlet section 222 to the outlet section 224, which are traveled by the various, cross-sectionally assorted fibers of the web V are advantageously of the same length.<br>
The funnel shaped web guiding device 220, can at one position be slit longitudinally down the side, in order that a simple reinsertion of a web end is made possible. The assurance must be made here, that the web, during the operation, does not enter into this slit. Another alternative to the aid of the reentry can be found therein, in that a wall section of the web guiding device 220 can be a flap opening or can be taken away.<br>
The fifth embodiment is the web device 320 in accord with Figs. 11 and 12. This said device 320 is designed in two parts. The outward directing guide surface 333 which diverts the middle fibers is a part of the body 331, which curvingly extends itself into funnel 321 and is, advantageously, adjustable in this position. Advantageously the body 321 is pivotal, this time about an axis 339 (see double arrow f5). For the resetting of the end of a web, this body 321 is first swung to the outside, the said end of the web is inserted deep into the funnel 321 and the machine is started in a slow stage. In the case of a successful resetting, then the body 331 can be swung back out of the service position into its operational position.<br>
The funnel 321 possesses likewise a guide surface 323, which conducts the middle fibers on their final path to the outlet section 324, after they have been diverted from the guide surface 333 away from their direct way from the inlet section 322 to the outlet section 324. Fig. 12 shows the web guiding device 320 in a view providing a better understanding of its characteristics.<br>
In accord with the sixth version of an embodiment of the present invention, in the embodiments shown in Figs. 13 and 14, is shown a web guiding device 420, which is similarly designed to those in accord with the Figs. 1-5. The following difference, however, is still at hand: The upper edge, that is, the upper edge 427b of the funnel 421, which at present is the single element of the web guiding device 420, runs in a straight line.   The thereby determined inlet<br>
11<br><br>
section 422 is rounded into the shape of a partial cylinder with a small radius which transforms itself in the web direction into guide surface 423, which has a small bulge contour. This said bulging is more pronounced in the direction of the web midsection than it is at the rim, in order to achieve the invented effect. The outlet section 424 is essentially semicircular in cross-section and on this account is constructed to be open, while also allows an easy accessibility to neighboring elements. The lateral edge sections 427a run essentially linearly from the curved inlet section 422 to the outlet section 424.<br>
In the area of the outlet section 424 provision is made for both the outer sides thereof, respectively, a flange 428, onto which a pivotal foot 429 is attached. The two pivotal foot pieces 428 are swingably mounted on a block 409 to pivot about an axis 411. This pivoting allows the funnel 421 to be brought out of an operative position (Fig. 13) into a maintenance position (Fig. 14) so that the insertion of a free end of the web can be made. (See the arrow about the axis 411.) Even in a case of a band blockage or a windup on the outlet rolls, the funnel 421 pivots from the operational position into its said maintenance position, so that easier access is provided for the correction of the disturbance.<br>
As may be further inferred from the Figs. 13,14, the under edge 427c of the funnel 421 lies on the block 409 and partially encompasses a craterlike opening 430, in which (not shown) a funnel insert and thereon, in the direction of travel of the web, finally a band funnel is attached.<br>
The difference in regard to the capability of pivoting in comparison to the embodiment shown in Figs. 1-5 can be found therein, in that principally the funnel 421 can be pivoted but not the following elements (for instance the web outlet apparatus or the band funnel).<br>
Common to the embodiments shown in the figures, is that the fibers of the web V, respectively, without abrupt changing of direction are directed to their respective outlet section in a protective manner. This is also true for the impacting of the fibers against the guide surfaces in the inlet section of the respective web guiding device. In that case, the fiber strikes nearly tangentially, i.e. at a very small angle against the guide surfaces.<br>
In the figures, the respective inlet sections, guide surfaces and outlet sections are show as built in one piece. It is, of course, entirely possible that the guide surfaces can be easily supplied as individual elements for their purpose, and can be installed in the intervening space between the inlet and the outlet sections. In that location the said elements can be either fastened or placed in a displaceable condition, the latter, of course, with the aid of a pivoting mechanism.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a nonwoven guiding device for a textile machine comprising a drawing frame (1), said device being used to compress a nonwoven fabric (V) leaving the drawing frame (1) in a deployed form. The inventive device comprises an input section (22; 122; 222; 322; 422) and a downstream output section (24; 124; 224; 324; 424) which has a narrow cross-section compared to that of the input section (22; 122; 222; 322; 422). The inventive nonwoven guiding device is characterised by at least one guiding surface (23, 33; 123, 133; 223, 233; 323, 333; 423) located between the input section (22; 122-, 222; 322; 422) and the output section (24; 124; 224; 324; 424), said guiding surface being embodied in such a way that the inner fibres - in the transversal direction of the nonwoven - are guided towards the output section (24; 124; 224; 324; 424) in a less direct manner than the outer fibres. The invention also relates to a textile machine comprising a drawing frame, said machine being characterised by a corresponding nonwoven guiding device.<br>
