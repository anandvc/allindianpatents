				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to electrical technology. More specifically, this invention relates to low inductance devices and energy conditioning.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND<br>
The word "terminal" means electrically conductive material at the point at which current enters or leaves an electrical device.<br>
The terms "X" capacitor and "line to line capacitor" both mean a two terminal passive lumped circuit element having a capacitance value across the two terminals wherein the two terminals are connected in parallel configuration with a circuit load device. X capacitors are primarily used to prevent electrical droop across loads. That is, X capacitors are typically used to provide storage of charge to be used as a source or sink of electrical energy. An X capacitor can also be formed including a conductive shield separating at least two electrodes.<br>
The terms "Y" capacitor and "line to ground capacitor" both mean a two terminal passive lumped circuit element having a capacitance value across the two terminals wherein one of the two terminals is connected to a line which is located in a circuit path between a source and a load and the other terminal is connected to an electrically conductive structure such as a metal layer on a PC board that, in lumped circuit diagrams, is usually shown as a ground. However, the voltage potential of the alleged ground may vary depending upon the amount of charge it receives or distributes. In applications, the alleged ground typically is one of an earth ground, a floating ground, and a chassis ground, and each one of these types of grounds could<br><br>
function as a circuit voltage reference. Y capacitors are primarily used to filter noise from signals.<br>
The term "plate" is used throughout to refer to structure typically formed by layering processes. Use of the term "plate" herein means structures that are integrated during their formation. The term plate as used herein means a structure with at least two relatively large area major surfaces and one or more relatively smaller area edge surfaces. Each major surface may but need not be flat.<br>
Energy conditioning means at least one of filtering, decoupling, and transient suppression of electrical energy propagating between a source and a load.<br>
Filtering means modifying the frequency spectrum of a signal.<br>
Decoupling is a term typically applied to active circuitry. In such circuitry, active devices change their properties, such as trans-conductance, which affects voltage on coupled elements. Decoupling means the minimization of the affects on the voltage of coupled elements due to the changes in the active circuitry.<br>
Transients include energy anomalies and energy spikes due to external effects, such as static discharges and parasitics, such as self induction induced hi a circuit.<br>
United States Patents (USPs) 6,018,448 and 6,373,673 disclose a variety of devices that provide electrical energy conditioning. The teachings of USPs 6,018,448 and 6,373,673 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The novel inventions disclosed herein are structures that have certain performance characteristics that significantly improve at least the decoupling aspect of electrical energy conditioning compared to the devices described above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a novel structure, a method of making the structure, and a method of using the structure, wherein the structure has a certain capacitance and provides energy conditioning that results in an ultra high insertion loss and unproved decoupling.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a circuit including a novel structure of the invention, a method of making the circuit, and a method of using the circuit.<br>
Additional objects of the invention are to provide devices, circuits, and methods of using them that provide unproved energy conditioning over a wide frequency range.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are provided by a structure comprising a first electrode including a first electrode plate, a second electrode<br><br>
including a second electrode plate, and an electrically conductive shielding including a center shield portion between the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate and outer shield portions facing sides of the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate opposite the sides facing the center shield portion, wherein the elements of the structure have certain geometric values, relative values, relative positions, and shapes.<br>
Generally speaking, plates of the first electrode receive electrical energy only along a conductive path that connects to only a portion of relatively long sides of the plate. Similarly, generally speaking, the first electrode receive electrical energy only along a path that connects to only a portion of relatively long sides of the plate.<br>
Preferably, substantially all plates of the first electrode have substantially the same shape and are stacked vertically aligned with one another. Preferably, substantially all plates of the second electrode also have substantially the same shape and are stacked substantially vertically aligned with one another. However, plates of the first electrode and the second electrode may each have an axis of symmetry or a plane of symmetry. If so, plates of the second electrode maybe oriented in the plane of the plates and inverted about the axis of symmetry or plane of symmetry relative to a plate of the first electrode.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are provided by a structure comprising:<br>
a first electrode including (A) a first electrode first plate, said first electrode first plate defining (1) a first electrode first plate an inner surface, (2) a first electrode first plate outer surface, and (3) a first electrode first plate edge surface defined by perimeters of said first electrode first plate inner surface and said first electrode first plate outer surface and (B) a first electrode contact region having a first electrode contact region surface for electrically contacting said first electrode;<br>
a second electrode including (A) a second electrode first plate, said second electrode first plate defining (1) a second electrode first plate an inner surface, (2) a second electrode first plate outer surface, and (3) a second electrode first plate edge surface defined by perimeters of said second electrode first plate inner surface and said second electrode first plate outer surface and (B) a second electrode contact region having a second electrode contact region surface for electrically contacting said second electrode;<br>
a shielding electrode including (1) an inner shielding plate, (2) a first outer shielding plate, (3) a second outer shielding plate, and (4) a shielding electrode contact region having a shielding electrode contact region surface for electrically contacting said shielding electrode;<br><br>
wherein said first electrode first plate inner surface faces said second electrode first plate inner surface;<br>
wherein (A) said inner shielding plate is between said a first electrode first plate inner surface and said second electrode first plate inner surface, (B) said first outer shielding plate is faced by said first electrode first plate outer surface, and (C) said second outer shielding plate is faced by said second electrode first plate outer surface; and<br>
wherein the elements of said structure have certain geometric values, relative values, relative positions, and shapes.<br>
Hereinafter electrodes of the structures of the invention other than the shielding electrode are sometimes referred to as non-shielding electrodes in order to distinguish them from the shielding electrode. A structure of the invention may include a plurality of shielding electrodes. A structure of the invention may include a plurality of non-shielding electrodes.<br>
The structure may also include, in the stack of electrode plates, additional first electrode plates of the first electrode, second electrode plates of the second electrode, and shielding electrode plates of the shielding electrode. The shield electrode may include shield electrode terminals, which may be in the shape of caps, and which include surfaces facing edges of.plates of the first and second electrodes and surfaces defining a portion of the surface of the structure. The shield electrode terminals may also include surfaces facing portions of outer surfaces of plates of the first and second electrodes. The structure may have some of its surface regions defined by electrically insulating material. Each shielding electrode may be in the shape of a cap.<br>
The structure preferably has an electrically insulating material between the plates that thereby substantially prevents electrons from moving from one electrode through the insulating material to another electrode. The insulating material may be any material that has a dielectric constant. Examples of the insulating material are air, which has a dielectric constant of one, ferro-magnetic material, ferrite material, diamond material, NPO dielectric material, COF dielectric material, and X7R. X7R has a dielectric constant of about 4600.<br>
The certain geometric values, relative values, relative positions, and shapes of structures of the invention include shapes of each of the plates of at least the first and second electrodes in the plane defined by the major surfaces of those plates, the locations and relative extensions of the electrode contact regions where electrical energy connects to those plates. In addition, the shapes of the plates include the thickness of the plates. The relative values include the spacings between the plates and the alignment of plates relative to one another.<br><br>
In one embodiment, plates of the invention have a finger-like shape, and are configured to define combs.<br>
The structures of the invention may include additional internal structural elements, such as electrically conductive wire lines, insulating portions and electrode edge interconnection structures. The structures of the invention may also include electrode terminals. The electrode terminals are conductive structure designed for contact and electrical connection to other circuit elements. The structures of the invention may also include apertures which may be lined with either non-conductive or conductive material, and which may be either partially or entirely filled with either non-conductive or conductive material. These apertures and their contents may serve the purpose of conducting electrical energy from outside the structure to one or more plates of electrodes inside the structure. Plates of the structure may include interior surfaces defining apertures in the plates through which electrically conductive wire lines extend. The material inside the apertures themselves can be made conductive and can serve in place of conductive wires. These types of apertures are known as conductive vias. Various apertures can also have portions that are either non-conductive and conductive areas that allow electricity to propagate from and to predetermined areas of electrodes to which these apertures pass thru. Electrically conducting wire lines may electrically connect to plates of the same electrode while extending through apertures in plates of other electrodes and remaining insulated from those other electrodes. In embodiments including an electrode terminal, the electrode terminal may electrically interconnect plates of the same electrode to one another, and physically and connect to edges of plates of the electrode. The wire lines may be either formed and then inserted into the apertures or formed in the apertures.<br>
The plates of the shielding electrode are electrically connected to one another. The plates of the shielding electrode preferably substantially shield each plates of each non-shielding electrode from one another. At least one plate of a non-shielding electrode is substantially shielded by a shielding electrode from every other plate of the non-shielding electrodes. The plates of the shielding electrode and at least a conductive structure electrically connects the plates of the shielding electrode to each other in order to substantially shield the plates of the non-shielding electrodes from one another.<br>
A first level interconnect is a structure or device that provides an initial circuit connection to an integrated circuit. In use as intended, a first level interconnect has energy pathways that connect to at least an energy source and/or to at least to an energy return.<br>
An interposer is a structure or device that provides a circuit connection to an<br><br>
integrated circuit.<br>
A structure of the invention may be formed as a discrete component, such as a component suited for connection to a PC board. Alternatively, a structure of the invention may be formed into and form part of another structure, such as a PC board, a first level interconnect, an interposer, or an integrated circuit, Including monolithic integrated circuits. In discrete component embodiments of the invention, the first electrode contact region surface defines a portion of a surface of the structure; the second electrode contact region surface defines a portion of the surface of the structure; and the shielding electrode contact region surface defines a portion of the surface of the structure.<br>
Discrete component and PC boards that incorporate the novel structures of the invention may be formed by conventional multiple-layering, screening, laminating and firing techniques.<br>
In either discrete or non-discrete arrangements of the novel stuctures employed for applications including, PC board and/or integrated circuit embodiment, certain ones of the electrode contact region surfaces that define a portion of the surface of the structure do not exist, per se. This is because the regions where those surfaces would otherwise define termination of a discrete component are formed in contact with electrically conductive material connecting to vias and/or extending from and/or through some portion of the PC board, substrate, first level interconnect, interposer and/or integrated circuit beyond the regions containing the first electrode, the second electrode, and/or the shielding electrode. Electrodes used could include arrangements with or without holes (apertures) and any combination of such are fully contemplated by the inventors.<br>
Preferably, the inner shielding plate extends, in the plane defined by its major surfaces, beyond the edges of adjacent plates of the first and second electrodes such that, with the possible exceptions noted below, any line passing through both of the adjacent plates (i.e., a plate of the first electrode and a plate of the second electrode) also passes through and/or contacts the inner shielding plate. An exception exists wherein, in some embodiments, relatively small regions of the plates of each of the first and second electrodes extend beyond the extension of the shield plates. The relatively small portions of the plates of the first and second electrodes that extend beyond the extension of the shield plates contact either an electrode edge interconnection structure or an electrode terminal. The edge electrode interconnection structure functions to electrically connect substantially all plates of the first electrode to one another and/or substantially all plates of the second electrode to one another. In addition or alternatively, at least a portion of the inner shielding plate generally<br><br>
extends a distance beyond the extension of adjacent plates of the first and second electrodes by at least one, preferably at least 5, more preferably at least 10, and most preferably at least 20 times the distance separating the inner shielding plate from an adjacent plate.<br>
The electrode edge interconnection structure and/or the electrode terminal are structures that electrically contact one or more edges of all or substantially all of the plates of an electrode thereby electrically connecting the plates that make up one of the electrodes to one another. The electrode edge interconnection structure and/or the electrode terminal of one electrode does not contact the plates of any other electrode. Electrode terminals typically exist in discrete components.<br>
In PC board and integrated circuit embodiments of structures of the invention, there may be no electrode edge interconnection structure or electrode terminal. Instead, typically, there will be structure electrically interconnecting all plates of the same electrode which includes electrically conducting wire lines that connect to plates of the same electrode. The electrically conducting wire lines that connect to plates of one electrode do not electrically connect to plates of other electrodes.<br>
Preferably, the electrically conducting wire lines connected to plates of one electrode pass through apertures in plates of other electrodes such that those wire lines do not electrically connect to the plates of the other electrodes. Other embodiments include arrangements with and arrangements without electrically conducting wire lines, and any combination of such are contemplated.<br>
In certain embodiments of structures of the invention, the shield plates may be interconnected at their periphery by a sufficient density of electrically conducting wire lines such that the shielding electrode provides a Faraday cage effect to the first electrode and the second electrode. Typically, the density of electrically conducting wire lines can be made sufficient to provide a Faraday cage effect to the first electrode and the second electrode by spacing at least one electrically conducting wire line at predetermined intervals or near the periphery of the shielding electrode plates.<br>
In some embodiments, it is preferable that the density of electrically conducting wire lines that electrically connect to the shielding electrode and surround the plates of the first electrode and the second electrode is at least one per centimeter, preferably at least one every two millimeters, and more preferably, at least one every millimeter. In these same embodiments, there may also be at least one and preferably several electrically conducting wire lines electrically connecting to plates of the first electrode. These electrically conducting wire lines pass through apertures and do not electrical connect to plates of the other electrodes. In these same embodiments, there may also be at least one and preferably several electrically conducting wire lines<br><br>
electrically connecting to plates of the second electrode and passing through apertures and not electrically connecting to plates of the other electrodes. Preferably, any electrically conducting wire line that connects to one plate of an electrode connects to substantially all of the remaining plates of that electrode.<br>
Preferably, the electrically conducting wire lines are oriented such that they extend in the direction substantially non-parallel to the plane defined by at least one plate of one electrode of the structure. For example, the electrically conducting wire lines may be oriented substantially perpendicular to a plane defined by a major surface at least one plate of one electrode of the structure.   Preferably, the electrically conductive wire lines define either a generally circular cross-section, a generally rectangular cross-section, or a strip shaped cross-section.<br>
Additional plates of the electrodes may exist in the structure in a stacked formation such that major surfaces of plates oppose one another.  These additional plates of the electrodes include the aforementioned three plates of the shielding electrode interleaved between the first plate of the first electrode and the second plate of the second electrode. The sequence of the additional plates of the structure may include the following, in repetitions: (1) a plate of the first electrode, followed by a shield plate, followed by a plate of the second electrode, followed by a shield plate;<br>
(2)	a plate of the first electrode followed by one, two, three, four, or five shield plates,<br>
a plate of the second electrode followed by one, two, three, four, or five shield plates;<br>
(3)	a plate of either the first or second electrode followed by one, two, three, four, or<br>
five shield plates, or more, another plate of the first or second electrode followed by<br>
one, two, three, four, or five shield plates, or more. Preferably, there are tens or<br>
&gt;t<br>
hundreds of the repetitions of plate sequences noted above, in each structure. Preferably, the stack of shielding electrode plates in each structure also terminates with at least one shield plate.<br>
Alternatively, the foregoing sequences of plates may entirely replace and be in lieu of three plates of the shielding electrodes interleaved between the first plate of the first electrode and the second plate of the second electrode.<br>
Moreover, plates of any one electrode maybe stacked such that the respective perimeter of each plate of the same electrode is substantially aligned or superposed with the other plates of the same electrode, even for plates separated from one another within a stack of plates. For example, plates of one electrode may have their major surfaces all rectangular in shape and the same size, and the rectangular plates may have the long axis of the rectangle aligned with one another. Plates may alternatively be hexagonal, circular, octagonal, pentagon, and a variety of other shapes that can be positionally and rotationally aligned.<br><br>
Furthermore, plates of one electrode may be aligned either positionally or rotationally to plates of another electrode, for example along axis of symmetry defined in the plane of the plates by the shape of the plates. In addition, plates of one electrode may be aligned offset laterally in position or rotationally skewed relative to plates of another electrode.<br>
Preferably, there is always at least one shield plate between any two plates of the first electrode, the second electrode or the first and second electrodes. Preferably, there is always at least one shield plate exterior to all plates of the first and second electrodes, i.e., outer shield plates. There may be two, three, four, or five shield plates exterior to all plates of the first and second electrodes on either or both ends of the stack of plates.<br>
Preferably, all plates of the first electrode have substantially (within manufacturing tolerances) the same dimensions and shape as one another, all plates of the second electrode have substantially (within manufacturing tolerances) the same dimensions and shape as one another, and generally all plates of the shielding electrode have substantially (within manufacturing tolerances) the same dimensions and shape as one another, with the exception of the outer shield layers. The outer shield layers, which are those layers exterior to all plates of the first electrode and the second electrode, may extend further in the plane defined by the plate surfaces than other plates of the shielding electrode. Preferably, all of the plates are substantially planar, that is, have plate surfaces that are flat, within manufacturing tolerances.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention include in combination with any integral structure of the invention a conductive area found beyond the structure such as on a first level interconnect, such that the conductive area serves as a final shielding plate for the shielding electrode of the structure of the invention.    All plates of the first electrode and all plates of the second electrodes may also be of substantially the same dimensions and shape as one another. All plates of the first electrode and all plates of the second electrodes may also be positioned complementary relative to one another and paired.<br>
The plate thicknesses vary with the type of fabrication. For discrete components fabricated by thick film technologies, such as layering and subsequent firing, each layer is typically between 0.5 and 30 microns, more preferably between 1 and 10 microns. However, the preferred layer thickness is a function of the conductivity of the plate layers and the area of the planar surface of each plate such that, the preferred thickness decreases as the planar dimensions of the plates decrease or the conductivity of the material forming the plates increases. Thus, smaller structures, such as structures formed by semiconductor fabrication, including<br><br>
lithographic processes, the preferred plate thicknesses may be as small as a few tens or hundreds of angstroms.<br>
The thickness of insulating layers between the conductive plates of the first, second, and shielding electrodes are of the same magnitude as the thickness of the conductive plates. However, for structures designed for higher voltage circuits, the insulating layers may be thicker than the thickness of the plates of the conductive layers in order to avoid dielectric breakdown in the insulating layers since thicker insulating layers reduce the electric field strength for a given voltage. Structures designed for higher voltage circuits may also incorporate higher dielectric breakdown dielectric materials, such as Diamond, For structures designed for use in lower voltage circuits, the thickness of the insulating layers may be substantially less than the thickness of the conductive plates. Particularly, for devices fabricated in semiconductor layered structures, such as in integrated circuits, the insulating layers maybe less than one half, preferably less than one fifth of the thickness of the conductive plate layers. In digital semiconductor applications, wherein switching voltages are typically less than 5 volts, insulating layer thicknesses are preferably less than 20 microns, more preferably less than 5 microns, still more preferably less than 2 microns, and most preferably less than 0.5 microns.<br>
In discrete structures, the electrical energy typically enters the structures at the electrical edge interconnection structure. In non-discrete structures, the electrical energy enters the structure along a first set of one or more conducting pathways that are electrically connected to the first electrode, a second set of one or more conductive pathways that are electrically connected to the second electrode, and a third set of one or more conductive pathways that are electrically connected to the shielding electrode. Any one or more of the first, second, and third sets of conductive pathways may include at least one conductive pathway extending in substantially the same plane as a plane defined by a major surface of a plate of one of the electrodes of the structure. Any one or more of the first, second, and third sets of conductive pathways may include at least one conductive pathway extending hi a direction that is substantially non-parallel, such as substantially perpendicular, to the plane defined by a major surface of a plate of one of the electrodes of the structure. For example, the first, second, or third set of conductive pathways may each include a lithographically defined conductive line in a plane defined by a major surface of one of the plates, or they may each include conductive material filling a via that extends non-parallel, such as substantially perpendicular, to the plane.<br>
The regions of conductive pathways where electrical energy enters the volume surrounded by the plates of the first, second, and shielding electrodes are referred to<br><br>
herein below as the energy entry regions of the first and second electrodes.<br>
An important feature of structures of this invention are relationships between the locations on the plates of the energy entry regions and the shapes of the plates. One novel limitation associated with certain structures of the invention relates to the distance between the energy entry regions of the first and second electrodes and the extension of the plates in a direction perpendicular to a line connecting the projection of the energy entry regions of the first and second electrodes onto a plane parallerto the major surface of the plates.<br>
More specifically, define a line segment, connecting the projection onto a plane parallel to a major surface of a first plate of the first electrode, of the energy entry regions of the first and second electrodes of the structure, as an energy pathway line segment.<br>
Also, define the length of the energy pathway line segment as the energy pathway line segment length.<br>
Also, define the length of any line segment perpendicular to the energy pathway line segment that terminates at an intersection with the edge of one plate of the first or second electrode as an energy perpendicular line segment.<br>
Finally, define the longest of the energy perpendicular line segments that intersects the energy pathway line segment as the maximal energy perpendicular line segment, and define the length of that segment as the maximal energy perpendicular line segment length.<br>
A novel limitation of certain structures of this invention is that the maximal energy perpendicular line segment length is equal to or greater than the energy pathway line segment length.<br>
Another novel limitation of certain structures of this invention that have first and second electrodes including at least one generally rectangular plate is that the energy entry region of the electrode including the generally rectangular plate is closer to a longer side of the generally rectangular plate than to either of the short sides of the generally rectangular plate.<br>
Another novel limitation of certain structures of this invention that have first and second electrodes including at least one generally rectangular plate is that the energy entry region of the electrode including the generally rectangular plate is closer to the center of a longer side of the generally rectangular plate than to the ends of the longer side.<br>
Another novel limitation of certain structures of this invention that have first and second electrodes including at least one generally rectangular plate is that the energy entry region of the electrode including the generally rectangular plate extends<br><br>
along a longer side of the generally rectangular plate by a fraction of the length of the longer side of at least 1/20, more preferably at least 1/10, more preferably at least about 1/5 and preferably less then about 2/3.<br>
Another novel limitation of certain structures of this invention that have first and second electrodes including at least one generally rectangular plate is that there are a plurality of the energy entry regions of the electrode including the generally rectangular plate, and the interval between at least two of those energy entry regions extends in the direction defined by the longer side of the generally rectangular plate by a fraction of the length of the longer side of at least 1/20, more preferably, at least 1/10, more preferably at least about 1/5 and preferably equal to or less then 1 and preferably less than about 2/3.<br>
Another novel limitation of certain structures of this invention that have first and second electrodes is that they are shaped, they have four sides that make up a perimeter, with two side portions of the perimeter longer than the other two side portions of the perimeter.<br>
One or more energy entry regions may be in a plane substantially parallel to a plane defined by a major surface of a plate of the first or second electrode, or in a plane perpendicular to a plane defined by a major surface of a plate of the first or second electrode.<br>
The inventor recognizes that each energy entry region is not a mathematical point and instead has a certain spatial extent. Accordingly, and only to the extent necessary to determine whether the novel geometric limitations disclosed herein above involving the relative positions and locations of the energy entry regions exist in a certain structure, associate with the one or more energy entry regions of an electrode a mathematical point that minimizes the mean root square distance to the loci of all points associated with the or those energy entry region or regions. In common language, associate one point most central to the energy entry region or regions connecting to an electrode, and then use the corresponding points defined for each of the electrodes (1) to define the aforementioned line segments and (2) to determine if the energy entry region is closer to a longer side of a generally rectangular plate than to either of the shorter sides of the generally rectangular plate.<br>
For structures of the invention having electrode edge interconnection structure or electrode terminals, the length of the energy pathway line segment may be equal to or greater than the length of a plate of the first or second electrode. In these structures, a novel limitation of this invention is that a first length defined as the length of a plate along the energy pathway line segment is equal to or shorter than a second length defined as the length of the plate in the direction perpendicular to the<br><br>
energy pathway line segment. In these structures, another novel limitation of this invention is that a first length defined as the length between electrode edge interconnection structure or electrode terminal of the first electrode and the second electrode is equal to or shorter than a second length defined as the length of the plate in the direction perpendicular to a plane defined by a major surface of the edge interconnection structure or electrode terminal and parallel to a plane defined by a major surface of a plate of the first or the second electrode. Preferably, the ratio of the second length to the first length is greater than one, more preferably greater than 1.1, more preferably greater than 1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,2, and most preferably greater than 3. Preferably, in view of manufacturing limitations, this ratio is less than 100.<br>
The foregoing lengths of the energy pathway line segment and the energy perpendicular line segments are defined relative to a single plate of the structure.<br>
The ratio of the length of the maximal energy perpendicular line segment to the length of the energy pathway line segment is referred to herein as the energy pathway ratio. Preferably the energy pathway ratio is greater than 1, preferably, greater than 1.1, more preferably greater than 1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,2, and most preferably greater than 3. Preferably, in view of manufacturing limitations, this ratio is less than 100.<br>
The shape of the plates of the first and second electrodes vary from generally oval to generally rectangular. Preferably, the shapes of the plates of the first and second electrodes are generally rectangular having the edges of the plates rounded thereby avoiding high radius of curvature corners. Preferably, edge connection regions of the plates protrude in the plane of each plate, relative to the rest of the same edge of the same plate, along the direction of the energy pathway line segment. The edge protrusion distance is sufficient to enable connection of that plate to the edge interconnection structure or electrode terminal.<br>
The actual dimensions of each plate along the energy pathway line segment and the energy perpendicular line segment depends upon the actual embodiment which in turn depends upon intended usage criteria including the desired DC capacitances of the structure. For discrete components, the typical actual edge parallel dimension and edge perpendicular dimensions range from about a tenth of a millimeter to several centimeters. However, for large capacitance high power applications, the inventors recognize that the actual edge parallel dimension and edge perpendicular dimensions may extend to tens of centimeters or meters. For example, very large capacitance structures may be employed in power grids to reduce the effect on line voltage of a rapid change in load.<br>

The shape of the plates of the shielding electrode are generally similar to the shape of the plates of the other electrodes. However, preferably, the shielding plates generally extend in the plane beyond the extension of the plates of the first electrode and the second electrode. However, the shielding plates may not extend beyond the extension of the edge protrusion regions so that edge protrusion regions of each of the first electrode and the second electrode may electrically connect the plates of each electrode to one another without also electrically connecting to the shielding electrode.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the edge protrusion connection of each of the first electrode and the second electrode has a surface that also defines a part of the surface of the structure. That surface enables electrical connection of that electrode to a circuit. In this preferred embodiment, the surface edge protrusion connection that also defines a part of the surface of the structure extends over three non-parallel, such as perpendicular, surfaces of the structure such that two of those surfaces are parallel, to the planar dimensions of the plates of the electrodes.<br>
Preferably, the shield plates of the shielding electrode generally extend in the plane of the plates beyond the extension of the plates of the first electrode and the second electrode, with exceptions for the edge protrusions of the first electrode and the second electrode. Moreover, the shielding electrode preferably also includes a shielding electrode edge connection that electrically connects the plates of the shielding electrode to one another. Preferably, the shielding electrode edge connection has a shielding electrode edge connection electrode surface that forms part of the surface of the structure. Preferably, the shielding electrode edge connection electrode surface extends in a first plane non-parallel, such as perpendicular, to the plane defined by the large area surfaces of plates. Preferably, the shielding electrode edge connection electrode surface also extends to part of both surfaces of the structure that are non-perpendicular, such as parallel, to the plane defined by the large area<br><br>
surfaces of the plates.

Thus, in a preferred embodiment, me shielding electrode forms a part of the surface of the structure that covers one side of the structure. Preferably, the shielding electrode also forms a part of the surface of the structure that also covers the opposite side and/or complimentary sides of the structure. In some embodiments, performance of the structure may be improved by electrically connecting the shielding electrode to conductive material having substantial surface area outside of the shielding electrode. Preferably, the conductive material having substantial surface area outside of the shielding electrode has a surface area at least as large as the surface area of a plate of the shield electrode, more preferably at least 2,3,4,5,10, or 100 times the surface area of a plate of the shield electrode. Alternatively, electrically connecting the shielding electrode to conductive material having substantial surface area, the structure of the invention may be formed including the conductive material having the substantial surface area. Most preferably, the surface area of the conductive material external to the shielding       ,. electrode and electrically connected to the shielding electrode is large enough so that the conductive material acts as fixed voltage for the shielding electrode.<br>
For all embodiments of the invention, preferably there is at least one shielding electrode plate between any plate of the first electrode and any plate of the second electrode. For all embodiments of the invention, preferably there is at least one shielding plate above all plates of both non-shielding electrodes and one shielding plate electrode below all plates of both the first and second electrodes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of test circuit 1 including source 10, device 20, meter 30, common points 40,50, ground (or source or sink of charge) 60, and device contacts or terminals a, b, and g. Source 10 is a source capable of providing voltage, current, or power with specified frequency components. Meter 30 is a device capable of measuring transmission of the signal provided by source 10 across the a and b terminals of device 20.<br>
Device 10 is a device which, in a lumped element theory, would be considered a three terminal device. Lumped element theory corresponds fixed values for inductance and/or capacitance with a physical structure of an element. A lumped element theory may not adequately describe the circuit properties of device 10.<br>
Device 10 is a device which, in a distributed element theory, would be considered as having at least three terminals. Distributed element theory associates values for inductance and/or capacitance to each conductive portion of a circuit, such as in transmission line theory.<br>
Device 10 may be a device which when energised, for example, becomes a voltage divider. When the energy potential measured across a source to meter line/load connection A from point 40 to a line having a meter to source return connection B from point 50 has a voltage VI, and the potential between these conductors and ground 60 is a voltage V2 being approximately half of the voltage VI, by interposing the shielding electrode structure (not shown) between non-shielding electrodes (also not shown), a phase balancing device and a voltage divider is created. It should be noted that this configuration can be easily and economically achieved<br><br>
using substantially less dielectric material disposed between non-shielding electrode plates relative to a shielding electrode plate to accommodate the voltage V2 as desired. It is of course recognized that the configuration or location and the numbers of shielding electrode plates could be modified to reflect or cause a change in the relative energized relationship between voltages VI and V2.<br>
Alternative novel structures of device 10 are described herein below.<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph 200 in which the x axis depicts frequency from ten thousand hertz to ten gigahertz and the y axis depicts transmission loss in dB from 0 to -120. Graph 200 shows curve 210 for a prior art device structure, device A, similar to structure 400a (see Fig. 4a) and curve 220 for a novel device structure, device B, similar to structure 400b (see Fig. 4b). Curves 210,220, represent insertion loss data for a peak to peak voltage difference of 50 Volts. Both device structures A and B have the same nominal DC capacitance of 100 nano Farads as one another, include nominally the same composition of dielectric material as one another, and have nominally the same external dimensions of 3.2 by 1.6 by 1.1 millimeters as one another, with plates stacked along the 1.1 millimeter dimension.<br>
Prior art device A has the same internal electrode layer configuration as device structure 400a (see Fig. 4a) except that it contains more electrode plate layers than device structure 400a. Novel device B has the same internal electrode layer configuration as device structure 400b (See Fig. 4b) except that it contains more electrode plate layers than device structure 400b.<br>
Summary data comparing insertion loss for curves 210 (for prior art device A) and 220 (for novel device B) appears in the following chart. The data values shown below are based upon Fig. 2 and have an uncertainty of about 2 dB.<br>

Curve 220 shows an insertion loss for device B from about 30 kilo Hertz to about 100 mega Hertz that is at or below noise threshold of meter 30 of about -110 db.<br>
Curves 210 and 220 show that the insertion loss of device A exceeds that of device B by at least about 64 dB over the range one mega Hertz to 100 mega Hertz. Curve 220 shows an insertion loss from one mega Hertz to 100 mega Hertz of no less than about -100 dB.<br>
Curve 220 shows an insertion loss for novel device B that is greater than the insertion loss of curve 210 for device A over the frequency range 30 kilo Hertz to 500 mega Hertz. For frequencies from 30 kilo Hertz to 100 kilo hertz, the insertion loss of device A exceeds that of device B by at least 40 dB; for 30 kilo hertz to 10 mega Hertz by at least 30 dB; for 10 mega Hertz to 100 mega Hertz by at least about 25 dB; and for 30 kilo Hertz to 200 mega Hertz by at least about 10 dB.<br>
Over the entire frequency range of 30 kilo Hertz to 100 mega Hertz the insertion loss of device A is greater than -60 dB, greater than -70dB, greater than -80dB, and greater than approximately -90 dB.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that structures like structure 400b have an insertion loss mat is substantially greater than the insertion loss of structures like structure 400a, for frequencies from just above zero to a few hundred mega Hertz.<br>
This invention is directed to the differences in structures, like the differences in structures 400a and 400b, that provide the tremendously greater insertion loss of structures like novel device structure 400b relative to device structure 400a.<br>

Figs. 4b and Figs. 5-9 illustrate structures of layers and a sequence of layers of one embodiment of the invention having the external structure shown in Fig. 3. This embodiment shows only a minimum sequence of plates of the shielding electrode, first electrode, and second electrode including one plate of a first electrode and one plate of a second electrode. The first and second electrodes may each include multiple electrode plates. Preferably, the first electrode has the same number of plates as the second electrode. Preferably, the number of plates of the shielding electrode that are spaced between a plate of the first electrode and a plate of the second electrode (i.e., excluding the plates of the shielding electrode external to the plates of the first and second electrodes) is equal to or greater than the sum of the number of electrode plates of the first electrode plus the number of electrode plates of the second electrode, minus 1.<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates a second embodiment of the invention including more than one plate forming each one of the first electrode and the second electrode.<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates another novel device structure 1500 having the outer surface structure shown in Fig. 3. Structure 1500 includes shielding electrode bottom plate 1501; shielding electrode middle plates 1503,1505,1507,1509,1511,1513,1515, 1517,1519; shielding electrode top plate 1521; first electrode lower plate 1502; first electrode middle plates 1506,1510,1514; first electrode upper plate 1518;'second electrode lower plate 1504; second electrode plates 1504,1508,1512,1516; and second electrode upper plate 1518. Structure 1500 also includes edge interconnection structure in the form of side electrode terminal 301 defining side electrode terminal conductive portion 1571 in top surface 328 and side electrode terminal side portion 1522 in side surface 324.<br>
Structure 1500 includes 11 shield plates for the shielding electrode and 5 plates for each of first and second electrodes. Each plate of the first electrode is separated a plate of the second electrode by a plate of the shielding electrode. In addition, there is a plate of the shielding electrode external to all plates of the first and second electrodes at the top of the structure and another plate of the shielding electrode external to all plates of the first and second electrodes at the bottom of<br><br>
structure.<br>
Structure 1500 shows an equal number of plates of the first electrode and the second electrode, which is preferred, because it provides improved signal conditioning. However, when structures like structure 1500 include a large enough number of plates in the first and second electrodes, a slight difference in number of plates in the first and second electrodes will not significantly impact signal conditioning ability.<br>
Accordingly, preferably for all embodiments, the difference between the number of plates of the first electrode and the number of plates of the second is less than one percent of the number of plates of either electrode.<br>
Figs. 16a-d relate to structures that incorporate electrically conductive paths passing through apertures in plates of one or more electrodes in order to electrically connect plates of one electrode to one another and/or electrically conductive paths not passing through apertures in plates of one or more electrodes in order to electrically connect plates of a shielding electrode to one another and define a cage including shielding electrode plates and electrically conductive paths around all plates of the first and second electrodes. Electrically conductive paths passing through apertures hi plates of one or more electrodes can be incorporated in discrete, PC board, and 1C embodiments of this invention.<br>

First electrode plate extension 1621 of plate 1602 extends from a plate overlap region of plate 1602 with one other plate in structure 1600 to a side of wire line 1610 opposite the side on which the one other plate entirely resides. The one other plate could be any one of plates 1601, and 1603-1609. First electrode plate 1606 may include plate extension 1620. Each one of second electrode plates 1604, 1608, may include a plate extension, as shown but not numbered.<br>

First electrode plate extension 1621, if it exists, terminates in first electrode plate extension termination 1650. Termination 1650 is shown as a point in a cross-section. In a plan view of plate 1602, termination 1650 is defined by an edge of plate 1602. That edge may be generally straight, may have rounded edges defining radii of curvature less than the width of plate 1602, or may define a necked structure having the general shape shown for the necked structure defined by transitions 850,860 and edge 820 of the front side edge of plate 402b in Fig. 8.<br>
In a fourth alternative embodiment indicated by dashed line 1670, at least one of and preferably all of the shield electrode plates have a shield electrode plate extension, like shielding electrode plate extension 1670 of shielding electrode plate 1601, indicated by the dashed line in Fig. ?16a, that extends away from the region of overlapped plates and/or the region between wire lines 1610,1611 beyond wire line 1640, preferably also extends beyond the-extension of at least one of the extension regions 1620,1621 of the plates of the first electrode, and preferably extends beyond the extension of all of the extension regions of the first and second electrodes. In this fourth embodiment, plate 1601 includes aperture 1680 in which a section of wire line 1610 resides. Aperture 1680 is large enough to prevents electrical contact of wire line 1610 to shielding electrode plate 1601.<br>
In another and fifth alternative embodiment relating to Fig. 16a, conductive wire line 1690, indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 16a, intersects with and electrically connects to shielding electrode plate extension 1670.

Fig. 16b shows a section of structure 1600 hi a plane showing wire lines connecting plates of the shielding electrodes. This plate is generally non-parallel, such as generally perpendicular, to the plane of the cut shown in Fig. 16a. Shielding electrode wire lines 1610b, 1611b intersect with and electrically connect shielding electrode plates 1601,1603,1605,1607 to one another. Wire line 1610b terminates at<br><br>
termination 1640b and intersects shielding electrode plates at shielding plate-wire intersections 1630b.<br>
Wire lines 1610b, 161 Ib exist beyond the extension of plates 1602,1604, 1606,1608 for all electrodes other than the shielding electrode.<br>
Fig. 16c shows, in a plan view, a surface of plate 1603 of the shielding electrode of structure 1600. Shielding plate-wire intersections 1603b, which are represented by dots in Fig. 16c, are locations where wire lines extending out of the page of Fig. 16c and intersect with and electrically connect to plate 1603.  Shielding plate-wire intersections 1630b, are distributed along a closed path near the periphery of plate 1603. Apertures 1680 are distribute at opposite sides 324,325, of plate 1603.<br>

In a six alternative embodiment, plate 1602 includes one or more apertures 1691 away from the periphery of electrode plate 1602. In the sixth embodiment, non-peripheral wire lines extend through apertures 1602 such that the non-peripheral wire lines do not electrically connect to electrode plate 1602, and each such non-peripheral wire does electrically connect to at least on other plate in structure 1600. For example, non-peripheral wire lines may connect all plates of one electrode to one another, may connect all plates of each non-shielding electrode to one another, or may connect all plates of the shielding electrode to one another.<br>

Necked portions 1708,1721 correspond to necked portions discussed herein above which electrically connect plates of electrodes to edge inter connection structure. Plate stack 1700 includes right side surface 1704, left side surface 1705, and left side portions 1706,1707. Points 1710,1723 represent the location geometric center of necked portions 1708,1721.<br>
Line segment 1750 extends between points 1723,1710, and line segment 1750. Line segment 1750 is the energy pathway line segment.<br>
Line segment 1751 extends from right side 1704 to region 1707 of left side 1705, and line segment 1751 is generally perpendicular to line segment 1750. Line segment 1751 represents an energy perpendicular line segment.<br>
Line segment 1752 extends from right side 1704 to region 1707 of left side 1705, and it is perpendicular to line segment 1750. Line segment 1752 intersects<br><br>
dashed line segment 1750 at a location resulting in the longest energy perpendicular line segment, and it is the maximal energy perpendicular line segment.  Line segment 1752 is longer than line segment 1751 because left side edge region 1707 is further than left side edge region 1706 from right side edge 1704.<br>

In some embodiments, the source or sink of charge to which the shielding electrode is electrically connected is a chassis ground. The conductive paths may be wires, coaxial cables, strip line, coplanar, waveguide, or any other type of conductive pathway used from zero to very high frequencies to transmit electrical energy.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the insertion loss of Device B exceeds that of Device A over a 100 megahertz range. The inventors recognize that the frequency range over which insertion loss of a structure of the invention exceeds a comparably dimensioned and externally shaped structure of a prior art device, various configurations of the invention may provide a different range in which the insertion loss exceeds the insertion loss of a corresponding prior art device, such as 1-1 mega Hertz, 0-10 mega Hertz, 0-1000 mega Hertz, 0-10000 mega Hertz, and that the absolute value of the insertion loss of these various devices of invention may range from greater than -40 dB, -50dB, -60 dB, -70 dB, -80 dB, -90 dB, -100 dB, -110 dB, and -120 dB, depending upon frequency, dimensions of the structure of the invention, circuit configuration of the conductive structure electrically connected to the shielding electrode, and composition of the materials forming the structure of the invention.<br>

Alternatively, any of these portions of the side, front, and back electrode terminals could have edges that are irregularly shaped, concave, convex, tapered, rounded, or with edges rounded.  Moreover, the edge interconnection structure may be formed from different conductive material than plates of wire lines in the structure. For example, at least some of the edge<br><br>
interconnection structure may be formed from higher cost higher conductivity materials, such as substantially pure gold, platinum, palladium, or iridium, and at least some of the conductive material internal to the structure may be formed substantially from nickel or copper.<br>
The center of front electrode terminal 306 may reside closer to side surface 324 than side surface 325 or vice versa. The center of back electrode terminal 310 may reside closer to side surface 324 than side surface 325 or vice versa. Preferably, front electrode terminal 306 covers front edge 820 of first electrode plate 402b. Preferably, back electrode terminal 310 covers the back edge of upper plate 404b that corresponds in shape to front edge 820. Thus, if the front electrode terminal of the back electrode terminal is offset towards one side, preferably the corresponding edges of the electrode plates of the non-shielding electrodes are also offset towards that side so that they each remain covered by an electrode terminal.<br>
Side electrode terminals 301 and 305 may include electrically conductive material extending between front electrode terminal 306 and back electrode terminal 310 thereby electrically connecting side electrode terminals 301,305 to one another to form a single external electrode terminal connecting to the plates of the shielding electrode.<br>

Portions of side electrode terminal 301, side electrode 305, or structure electrically connecting those two terminals to one another, may overlap portions of one or both of front and back electrodes 306,310, and be electrically insulated therefrom by a dielectric material.<br>
Back electrode terminal side to side width 320 may be less than 95 percent of the side to side width L, preferably less than 70 percent of side to side width L, and most preferably less than 30 percent of side to side width L. Side electrode terminal conductive portion side to side width 322 maybe zero, maybe less than 5 percent of side to side width L, may be less than 15 percent of side to side width L, may be less than 40 percent of side to side width L, and preferably is interconnected to conductive portions of side electrode terminal 305 in a region between the front and back electrodes 306,310.<br>

Structure 300 may be curved to the extent as to form a coiled generally cylindrical structure wherein one of side electrode terminals 301,305 is at the center<br><br>
of the cylinder and aligned with the cylindrical axis and the other one of side electrode terminals is at the periphery of the cylinder and aligned with the cylindrical axis. In this alternative, front and back electrodes 306,310, are at ends of the cylinder and offset from the center and periphery of the cylinder.<br>
Structure 300 may be curved and modified to the extent as to form a coiled generally cylindrical structure wherein side electrode terminals 301,305 are at opposite ends of the cylinder, one of front and back electrodes 306, 310 is at the center of the cylinder, and the other one of front and back electrodes has a surface portion forming part of the cylindrical surface of structure 300 at a middle of structure 300. In this alternative, the one of the front and back electrodes 306,310 at the center of the cylinder is modified to include a conductive path extending along the axis of the cylinder to one end of the cylinder, and the side electrode terminal 306,310 at that end of the cylinder is modified such that there is an insulating region surrounding portion of the conductive path connected to the centrally located terminal that extends to the end of the cylinder.<br>
Alternatively, structure 300 may contain a series of folds in a zig zag configuration with fold axis along either the side to side or front to back direction.<br>
Preferably, the ground or source or sink of charge connected to a shielding electrode of any embodiment of the invention has a surface area of at least 1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8,9,10,50, or 100 times the surface area of any plate of the shielding electrode.<br>
Alternatively, structure 300 may include a set of front electrode terminals, similar hi shape and dimension to front electrode terminal 306, but distributed along front surface 326 (and portions in the top and bottom surfaces) and/or a set of back electrode terminals distributed along back surface 327 (and portions in the top and bottom surfaces). Alternatively, front electrode terminal 306 or any one of multiple front and back electrodes may not include portions on one or both of the top and bottom surfaces of structure 300. Multiple front or back electrode embodiments preferably also have electrical connected to each front or back electrode at least one plate.<br>
Multiple front electrode embodiments may have a different set of plates electrically connected to each electrode of the front plate. Similarly, multiple back electrode embodiments may have a different set of plates electrically connected to each electrode of the back plate. Sets of different electrode plates connected to multiple front and back electrodes would provide a structure with more than two non-shielding electrodes. Such a structure having multiple terminals can be incorporated in a circuit architecture having multiple loads or multiple sources wherein each pair of<br><br>
paths between a load and its source electrically contacts a terminal of the structure. Thus, one, two, three, or more sources and/or one, two, three, or,more loads may be connected across a structure of the invention.<br>
Multiple front electrode embodiments may have located in at least one plate multiple plates each either electrically connected to the same electrode or to different electrodes. In these embodiments, preferably the multiple plates in the same plane are plates of the electrodes other than the shielding electrode.<br>
Fig. 4b shows in structure 400b portions of electrode plates that electrically contact to the electrode edge interconnection structure and/or electrode terminal shown in Fig. 3. Figs. 5-8 show aspects of structure 400b.<br>
Alternatively, as previously indicated, structures of the invention may include multiple plates in each electrode. At least one or each plate of each of the first and second electrodes an similar additional non-shielding electrodes may have a plurality of edges that form part of a front or back surface 326,327. The necked portions of the type formed by lower first electrode plate front edge 820 and transitions 850, 860, may form right angles, or they may be very gradual having relatively large radii of curvatures extending from the edge 820 all the way to the corner edge recessed transitions 890a-d. In one alternative embodiment transitions 850,860 and corner edge recessed transitions 890a-d merge to forma substantially circular major surface shaped plate, with our without a substantial necked portion resulting in edge 820.<br>
The recesses of the type shown by front edge recess distance 870 from the front or back edges 326,327 may have a length ranging from substantially zero to about 40 percent of front to back width W, preferably at least 1 percent, more preferably at least 4 percent, and preferably at least 10 percent of front to back width<br>
W.<br>
i<br>
Distance 630 may be less than, equal to, or greater than the length of front edge recess distance 870. Distance 630 may be zero, may be at least one, more preferably at least 2,5,10, or 20 times plate separation distance 630. Preferably, non-shielding electrode plates are recessed relative to adjacent shielding electrode plates along their entire periphery, except for the necked regions where they connect to electrode interconnection structure.<br>
The setback distance of the shielding electrode plates, like lower shielding electrode front edge distance 771, from front and back surfaces 326,327, is preferably less than the recess distance 870 of non-shielding electrode plates. Distance 771 along the front side surface in a region overlapping a neck of a non-shielding electrode plate such as edge 820 of plate 402b shown in Fig. 8, must be sufficient to prevent electrical connection of the shielding electrode plate to the non-shielding electrode's<br><br>
plate. Typically, distance 771 in such a region is at least one micron, preferably at least 5 microns, and may be 10,20,30,40,50, or more microns.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a rectangular shielding plate electrode major surface for plate 401b. Alternatively, the width between front 326 and back 327 may vary. This width may be flared such that the width between the front 326 and the back 327 is large at sides 324,325. The width of plate 401b at sides 324,325 may equal the width from front to back of plate surrounding material 710. Plate 401b may be shaped to form hi an inverse neck wherein the major surface of plate 401b has width W at all portions except a portion adjacent necked regions of the non-shielding electrodes like necked region 820,850,860 shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 shows lower and upper non-shielding electrode terminals as mirror images about line 910 in Fig. 9. Alternatively, each of these plates may include a set of more than one necked regions for making a plurality of electrical contacts to edge interconnection structure. Moreover, the necked regions may exist at different locations along the side to side length between sides 325,325. Moreover, necks may have different neck widths (i.e., like the width between 850,860) or edge widths (i.e., like the length of edge 82) from one another on the same plate or on different plates. Further, the setback distance 870 may be different between different necks on the same plate or on different plates. For example, in embodiments including more than two non-shielding electrode terminals, plates of one non-shielding electrode may all have the same neck width and different setback distance as one another, and either of both of those distance may be different from at least one other or all other plates of any other non-shielding electrode in the structure.<br>
Structure 402b is shown with equal distances between plates and represent plates as energy pathways. However, each plate of the non-shielding electrodes and shielding electrode may have a different thickness form one another, and the distances between the top two and bottom two plates may be different from distances between the center three plates.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a multilayer structure 1500 of the invention with equally spaced layers, and equally spaced recesses of layers from surfaces (such as the surface on the right hand side of the structure) and relative to the edges of the shielding layers. Alternatively, the distance of the recesses of each layer from a surface, the length of the recess of edges of plates of the non-shielding electrodes from the edges of plates of the shielding electrode, and the distances between adjacent plates may all be different from one another. In some embodiments, distances between several layers adjacent either or both of the top or the bottom are spaced further apart from one another than layers further from the top or bottom of the structure. Manufacturing<br><br>
requirements on a specified thickness of a specified number of layers may require adjusting thicknesses of the final layers to be either thicker or thinner than initial layers in order to meed the specified thickness. Manufacturing processing, such as heating, may result hi layers all of initially the same nominal thickness having different thicknesses towards one or both of the top or bottom of the structure.<br>
Structures like multilayer structure 1500 may have the same features and variations to their plates and overall shape as noted above for structure 402b.<br>
Figure 16a shows one section view of structure 1600. Alternatively, hi the same section, there maybe only one of conductive wire lines 1610,1611, or 2,3,4,5, or more conductive wire lines connecting plates of the same non-shielding electrode to one another. Alternatively, of course, structure 1600 may include a larger number of plates, such as the 11 shielding plates and 5 plates in each non-shielding electrode as in structure 1500, or more layers, such as 50,100,150,200, or more. In structure with more layers, each wire line may not electrically connect to each plate of the same non-shielding electrode, and there may be 2,3,4,5,10,20,50, or more conductive wire lines electrically connecting to plates of the same non-shielding electrode. Further, the variations in shapes of the plates and the limitations on their relative setbacks and recesses discussed for structures 402b and 1500 are applicable to structures like structure 1600. Setback distances and relative distances discussed for edges of plates of non-shielding electrodes of structure 402b relative to edge interconnection structure correspond to the distance, in the plane of a plate, from edges of plates of non-shielding electrodes of structure 1500 to shielding plate-wire intersections 1630b.<br>
Structures of the invention may be formed by laying down suitable precursor layers for dielectric and conductive material and subsequent heating, by thin film deposition, masking, and lithography techniques, by machining techniques including micro machining. Many such techniques are well known in the art.<br>
Circuits may be constructed by the foregoing techniques, and also by soldering and mechanically and/or electrically connecting components to one another and to supporting structure.<br>
In one circuit embodiment, a ground (or source or sink of charge), such as ground (or source or sink of charge) 60 in Fig. 2 is electrically connected to the shielding electrode interconnection structure at both sides 324,325. Such connections were made in the circuit in which Device A and Device B were tested by mechanical connection of the ground (or source or sink of charge) 60 to each side corresponding to sides 324, 325 of structure 300 for devices A and B.<br>
