Method for Producing Quinolone Carboxylic Acid Derivative<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a quinolone compound having high antibacterial activity and high safety, at high yield and in a simple manner. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Generally, a quinolone compound has a cyclic amine substituent including a second amino moiety at the 7-position<br>
(or an equivalent position thereof) of the quinolone skeleton. Such quinolone compounds are generally synthesized by reacting a cyclic amine compound with a 7-halogenated quinolonecarboxylic acid compound.  In order to enhance yield and reaction site specificity, the carboxylic acid moiety of a quinolonecarboxylic acid compound is transformed into a borofluoric acid ester moiety or a boric acid ester moiety, followed by reaction with a cyclic amine compound (see Patent Documents 1 to 3 and Non-Patent Documents 1 to 4).<br>
[0003]<br>
Furthermore, from an industrial viewpoint, there have been developed methods for producing quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives at high efficiency; e.g., a production method in which an alkyl borate is employed as an additive (Patent<br><br>
Document 4), and a one-pot method (Patent Document 5). Patent Document 1: JP-A-1987-252772 Patent Document 2: JP-A-1988-316757 Patent Document 3: JP-A-1991-95177 Patent Document 4: JP-A-1993-294938 Patent Document 5: WO 2005/047260<br>
Non-Patent Document 1: Majid M. Heravi et al., Journal of Chemical Research, 2005, 579.<br>
Non-Patent Document 2: Liu Ming-Liang et al., Chinese Journal of New Drugs, 2004, 13, 12, 1130.<br>
Non-Patent Document 3: Liu Ming-Liang et al., Chinese Journal of Pharmaceuticals, 2004, 35, 3, 129.<br>
Non-Patent Document 4: Liu Ming-Liang et al., Chinese Journal of Pharmaceuticals, 2004, 35, 7, 385. Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention [0004]<br>
When the method disclosed in Patent Document 3 is employed, a free-form amine compound is reacted to give quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives at a high yield (72 to 81%) . However, free-form cyclic amine compounds have less chemical stability and poor handleability, which are problematic. Then, when a salt-form cyclic amine compound, which is excellent in stability and handleability, is employed in a reaction, the quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative yield (49%) do not reach the yield which is obtained by use of a free-form amine compound. Thus, use of<br>
such an amine compound salt is still problematic in terms of industrial production.<br>
[0005]<br>
In the method disclosed in Patent Document 4, no quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative can be produced even when a cyclic amine salt compound having a high stability and high handleability is used.  In addition, the method disclosed in Patent Document 4 includes a step of transforming a carboxylic acid moiety to a borofluoric acid ester by use of an expensive silylating agent (i.e., via silyl ester), making this method cumbersome. Therefore, there is demand for a production method which can be performed in a simpler manner.<br>
[0006]<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to establish a novel process which is friendly to the global environment, the process employing a high-stability, high-handleability cyclic amine salt compound which realizes reaction at high efficiency; avoiding use of an expensive silylating agent; and reducing the process waste. Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0007]<br>
The present inventors have carried out extensive studies on the aforementioned process, and have found that through allowing the compound represented by formula (2), a cyclic amine salt, and a boron derivative to react in a solvent in the presence of a base, quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives can be efficiently synthesized in a one-pot<br>
reaction without forming a silyl ester, thereby realizing an industrially advantageous method for producing a guinolone-based synthetic anti-bacterial agent. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. [0008] to [0016]<br>

Effects of the Invention [0017]<br>
According to the present invention, a quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative is converted to a borofluoric acid ester or a boric acid ester thereof, which has enhanced reactivity for producing a quinolone derivative, and the formed boron-containing derivative is employed as a starting material of condensation reaction. Therefore, the boron-containing derivative is condensed with a cyclic amine salt compound having high stability and handleability in the presence of a base in one reaction mixture. This process can be performed in a simple manner without isolating the boron-containing derivative, thereby reducing isolation loss. Since the condensation reaction can be performed in a one-pot manner, possible exposure of workers to harmful intermediates can be reduced, and the production yield can be remarkably enhanced. Therefore, from an industrial viewpoint, a target compound represented by formula (1) can be produced at high yield in a simple manner.<br>

In the method of the present invention, a tertiary amine salt is preferably present in the reaction mixture. Among such salts, tertiary amine acid-adduct salts are preferably used. No particular limitation is imposed on the tertiary amine, so long as the amine is tertiary nature, and any of aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic amines, and complex amines thereof may be employed. Examples of the tertiary amine include the aforementioned trialkylamines (e.g., triethylamine, N,N-diethylisopropylamine, and tributylamine); dialkylarylamines<br>

The reaction temperature may fall within a range of room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent. The reaction completes within a period of about 3 0 minutes to 78 hours. [0060]<br>
Through the aforementioned procedure, a quinolone carboxylic acid compound in which the carboxylic acid moiety has been transformed to a boron chelate substituent is produced. The boron chelate substituent is removed through hydrolysis after completion of reaction with a cyclic amine. When the amino group has been protected, the amino group is deprotected, whereby a quinolone compound of interest can be produced. No particular limitation is imposed on the conditions under which hydrolysis to remove a boron substituent is performed, and the hydrolysis is performed under generally employed conditions. For example, the hydrolysis may be performed in a hydrated alcoholic solvent<br>
containing methanol, ethanol, etc., or in a hydrated amide solvent containing dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), etc. with heating. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature between<br>
80°C and the boiling point of the employed solvent. Deprotection may be performed under suitable conditions depending on the employed protective group. For example, the aforementioned hydrolyzate is subjected to hydrogenolysis or treatment with concentrated hydrochloric acid. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture is alkalinized with, for example, aqueous sodium hydroxide, and neutralized with an appropriate acid such as hydrochloric acid. The precipitated crystals are recovered through filtration, or extracted with a solvent such as chloroform. The thus-produced compound is purified through, for example, dissolution in an appropriate solvent for recrystallization, whereby a quinolone compound of interest can be yielded.<br>
