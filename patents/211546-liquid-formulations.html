Description<br>
Liquid formulations<br>
The invention relates to the field of liquid formulations. In particular, the invention relates to liquid formulations of herbicidally active compounds from the group of the inhibitors of acetoacetate synthase (hereinbelow referred to as ALS inhibitors), such as sulfonylureas.<br>
In general, active compounds are not employed as pure substances but, depending on the area of use and the desired physical properties of the use form, in combination with certain auxiliaries, i.e. they are "formulated". In principle, active compounds can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or physicochemical parameters. The following are examples of general possibilities for formulations: wettable powders (WP), oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions (EW and EO, respectively), suspensions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL) or else granules for soil application. or for broadcasting, or water-dispersible granules (WG). The formulation types mentioned are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], volume 7, C. Hauser-Verlag, Munich, 4th edition, 1986; van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel-Dekker N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd ed., 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London,<br>
If the active compounds to be formulated are compounds which generally tend to degrade chemically in the dissolved state or in liquid media, preference is usually given to solid formulations such as wettable powders or granules. As described in US4599412 and US5731264, this is the case, for example, for herbicidally active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors, such as metsulfuronmethyl, nice-or rimsulfuron, primisulfuronmethyl, triad-, pro-, amido- or ethoxysulfuron. Accordingly, powder formulations or granules of these herbicides - as, for example, in WO9910857, WO9809516, WO9508265, US5441923, W09423573, JP05017305, JP04297404, JP04297403 or JP04066509 - are already known.<br><br>
Frequently, when such powder formulations or granules are diluted with water (to prepare the spray liquor), the undissolved fractions in the concentrate cannot be dissolved completely, i.e. the spray liquor is a suspension of the concentrate. However, it is always advantageous if spray liquors are as finely divided as possible, since this reduces the risk of the spray nozzles being blocked and thus quite generally the expenditure for cleaning. Moreover, powder and granule formulations can only be prepared with a relatively high input of energy and technically complicated stirrers, i.e. there are considerable disadvantages even during their preparation.<br>
Liquid suspensions of herbicides of the kind described above in the form of suspension concentrates are already known (FR2576181, EP0205348, EP0237292 or EP0246984). However, in the case of suspensions, too, the active compounds are not dissolved, so that during application of the spray liquor similar problems are encountered as in the case of powder formulations or granules. Moreover, suspension concentrates (SC) arid suspoemulsions (SE) are thermodynamically unstable formulations having limited physical storage stability.<br>
Surfactant-free aqueous solutions of sulfonylureas are described in US4683000, US4671817 and EP0245058, water-free emulsifiable concentrates are described in the publications DE3422824, US4632693, WO9608148 and US5597778. None of these publications give any hints on how to increase the storage stability of the formulations.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a formulation which is stable to degradation and which has favorable performance properties. Surprisingly, it has now been found that this object is achieved by certain liquid active compound formulations comprising polycarboxyiic acid derivatives and, as active compounds, ALS inhibitors such as, for example, sulfonylureas and/or salts thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquid formulation (preparation),<br>
comprising<br>
a) one or more derivatives of polycarboxyiic acids, preferably one or more<br>
compounds from the group of the Gemini surfactants and/or the sulfo succinates,<br>
and<br><br>
b) one or more active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors, in particular one or more sulfonylureas and/or salts thereof, for examples salts with organic cations based on nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus and/or inorganic cations such as metal cations.<br>
The liquid formulations of the present invention are preferably herbicidal formulations, for example in the form of emulsion concentrates. The formulations preferably comprise at least one of the active compounds from the group of the ALS inhibitors in dissolved form. Preference is furthermore given to formulations which comprise only one polycarboxylic acid derivative.<br>
If appropriate, the liquid formulations of the present invention may, in addition to components a) and b), also comprise one or more auxiliaries and additives as further components, for example:<br>
(c)	additional surfactants and/or polymers,<br>
(d)	organic solvents,<br>
(e)	agrochemicais which are different from ALS inhibitors, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, safeners, growth regulators or fertilizers,<br>
(f)	customary formulation auxiliaries, such as antifoams, evaporation inhibitors, odorants, colorants, antifreeze agents or preservatives,<br>
(g)	tank mix components, and/or<br>
(h)   additional water.<br>
The polycarboxylic acid derivatives which are present in the formulations according to the invention as component a) are, for example, their esters, amides or salts, and the sulfonates, sulfates, phosphates or carboxylates derived from the polycarboxylic acids or, for example, their esters, amides and salts.<br>
Suitable polycarboxylic acids are, for example, dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, tetracarboxylic acids or else carboxylic acids of higher functionality, preferably having 2-20 carbon atoms. Also suitable are polymeric polycarboxylic acids, preferably having molecular weights of up to 2 000 g/moil. Examples of polycarboxylic acids are oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutamic, adipic, pimelic, sebacic, azelaic, sub Eric, maleic, ophthalmic, terephthalic, mellitic, trimellitic, polymaieic, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic acid and also co- or terpolymers comprising maleic, acrylic and/or methacrylic acid units.<br><br>
Formally, the polycarboxylic acid esters can be obtained, for example, by reacting the free carboxylic acids with alcohols or alkoxy ation products thereof, the esters being produced, for example, by reaction of "activated" carboxylic acids such as carboxylic anhydrides with the alkoxylates or alcohols mentioned. Furthermore, instead of the alcohol alkoxylates, it is also possible to use alkoxylates based on fatty acids, amides or amines for esterification with the polycarboxylic acids mentioned, if they have at least one specifiable hydroxy! group.<br>
Formally, the polycarboxamides can be produced, for example, by reacting the carboxylic acids with primary or secondary amines or with ammonia. The primary and secondary amines may, for example, have linear, cyclic or branched aromatic, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic C1-C20"hydrocarbon radical substituents, preferably C1-C2o-alkyl radicals, where cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radicals may contain additional hetero ring atoms, for example morpholine. The  hydrocarbon radicals may also be replaced by (poly)alkylene oxide units, such as (poly)ethylene oxide, (poly)propylene oxide or (poly)butylene oxide. Examples are the amino compounds ethanolamine, diethanolamine, 1-amino-2-propanol or amino-butanol, and their (poly)alkylene oxide adducts. Also suitable are alkyl ethers or alkyl esters prepared from these compounds and having linear or branched aromatic, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic mono-, di- or polyfunctional  -alcohols. Furthermore suitable are also the oxidation products of the alkoxylate amines, such as glycine and salts thereof.<br>
Suitable polycarboxylic acid salts are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, or salts having organic counterions, such as organic ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium ions.<br>
If the polycarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acid derivatives such as esters, amides<br>
or salts have reactive groups such as double bonds, it is possible to obtain further<br>
polycarboxylic acid derivatives by reacting these groups, for example<br>
by oxidation and ring-opening and subsequent reaction with (poly)alkylene oxides<br>
and subsequent reaction with phosphoric anhydride or sulfuric acid,<br>
by oxidation and ring-opening and subsequent reaction with alkylating agents, such<br>
as dimethyl sulfate.<br><br>
by oxidation and ring-opening and subsequent reaction with carboxylic acids, such<br>
as fatty acids,<br>
by oxidation and ring-opening and subsequent reaction with phosphoric anhydride or<br>
sulfuric acid and subsequent reaction with (pony)alkylene oxides, or<br>
by reaction with sodium disulfide or potassium disulfide.<br>
The resulting polycarboxylic acid derivatives for their part can be reacted once or more than once in one of the manners described above - one possibility is, for example, an alkoxylation of an acidic phosphated polycarboxylic ester alkoxylate or polycarboxamide alkoxylate, where the resulting and further reaction products of the polycarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acid derivatives, too, are suitable derivatives of polycarboxylic acids for the purpose of the present invention..<br>

alkaline earth metal cation, an ammonium cation, such as NH4, aIkyl-, alkylaryl- or poly(arylalkyl)phenyl-ammonium cation or (poly)alkylene oxide adducts thereof, or an amino-terminate (poly)alkylene oxide adduct.<br>
For the purpose of this description, (poly)alkylene oxide adducts are reaction products of starting materials which can be alkoxylate, such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, such as fatty acids, hydroxy- or amino-functional carboxylic esters (for example triglycerides based on castor oil) or carboxamides with alkylene oxides,<br><br>
where the (poly)alkylene oxide adducts have at least one alkylene oxide unit but are generally polymeric, i.e. have 2-200, preferably 5-150, alkylene oxide units. Among the alkylene oxide units, preference is given to ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide units, in particular to ethylene oxide units. The (poly)alkylene oxide adducts described can be constructed of identical or different alkylene oxides, for example of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide arranged in blocks or randomly, and, accordingly, the present application also comprises such "mixed" alkylene oxide adducts.<br>

(g)    tank mix components, ana/or (h)    additional water.<br>
Thus, the liquid formulations of the present invention may comprise, as component c), for example one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants and/or polymers and/or one or more components based on silicone, such as, for example, trisiloxane surfactants, derivatives of polydimethylsiloxanes and/or silicone oils. Examples of preferred components c) are (poly)alkylene oxide adducts, in particular of fatty alcohols and/or fatty acids and/or components which are insoluble in the continuous phase. Examples of (poly)alkylene oxide adducts are Soprophor CY8® (Rhodia), Genapol X-060® Genapol X-080® or Genagen MEE® (methyl ester ethoxylates) (Clariant) and other terminally-capped surfactants having a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl. isopropyl, n-butyi, tert-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or acetyl group as terminal grouping. Components which are insoluble in the continuous phase and which can be used are, for example, anionic surfactants, such as Hostapur OSB® (Clariant), Netzer IS® (Clariant), Gaioryl DT 201® (CFPI), Tamol® (BASF) or MonA/et D 425® (Witco). By incorporating components which are insoluble in the continuous phase or else insoluble active compounds into the formulations, dispersions are obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also embraces dispersions.<br>
Moreover, the liquid formulations according to the invention may also comprise, as component d), solvents, for example organic solvents, such as nonpolar solvents, polar protic or aprotic dipolar solvents and mixtures thereof. Examples of solvents are<br>
aliphatic or a.’omatic hydrocarbons, for example mineral oils, paraffins or toluene, xylenes and naphthalene derivatives, in particular 1-methylnaphthalene. 2-methylnaphthalene, mixtures of Ce-Cie-aromatic compounds, such as the Solvesso® group (ESSO), for example with the types Solvesso® 100 (b.p. 162-177X), Solvesso® 150 (b.p. 187-207°C) and Solvesso® 200 (b.p. 219-282°C) and Ce-Cao-aliphatic compounds, which may be linear or cyclic, such as the products of the Shellsol® group, types T and K, or BP-n paraffins,<br>

such as, for example, cyclohexanone or isophorone,<br>
nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and benzonitrile,<br>
sulfoxides and sulfones, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfoiane,<br>
and also<br>
oils in general, such as mineral oils or vegetable oils, such as corn oil, linseed<br>
oil and rapeseed oil.<br>
Organic solvents which are preferred for the purpose of the present invention are ester oils, such as rapeseed oil methyl ester, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol or triacetin.<br>
In addition to the ALS inhibitors which are present as component b), the liquid formulations according to the invention may, as component e), comprise further agrochemicals which are different from ALS inhibitors. This applies, for example, to combinations of herbicides different from ALS inhibitors, for example from the group of the phenoxyphenoxypropionates, such as diclofop-methyl, of the group of the heteroaryloxyphenoxypropionates, such as fenoxaprop-ethyl or clodinafop-propargyl, or from the group of the alkylazines, or else for combinations with safeners.<br>
Herbicides which are different from ALS inhibitors are, for example, herbicides from the group of the carbamates, thiocarbamates, haloacetanilides, substituted phenoxy-, naphthoxy- and phenoxyphenoxycarboxylic acid derivatives and also heteroaryloxyphenoxyalkanecarboxylic acid derivatives, such as quinolyloxy-, quinoxalyloxy-, pyridyloxy-, benzoxazolyloxy- and<br><br>
benzthiazoiyloxyphenoxyalkanecarboxylic esters, cyclohexanedione derivatives, imidazolinones, pyrimidinyloxypyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives, pyrimidyloxybenzoic acid derivatives, triazolopyrimidinesulfonamide derivatives and also S-(N-aryl-N-alkylcarbamoylmethyl) dithiophosphoric esters. Preference is given here to phenoxyphenoxy- and heteroaryloxyphenoxycarboxylic acid esters and salts, to imidazolinones and to herbicides which are used together with ALS inhibitors (acetolactate synthetase inhibitors) for widening the activity spectrum, for example betazone, cyanazine, atrazine, dicamba or hydroxybenzonitriles such as bromoxynil and ioxynil and other foliar herbicides.<br>

In the liquid formulations according to the invention, customary formulation auxiliaries, such as antifoams, antifreeze agents, evaporation inhibitors, presen/atives, odorants or colorants may be present as component f). Preferred formulation auxiliaries are antifreeze agents and evaporation inhibitors such as glycerol, for example in an amount of from 2 to 10% by weight, and preservatives, for example Mergal K9N® (Riedel) or Cobate C®.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also, as component g), comprise tank mix components. Examples of these are tank mix adjuvants, such as Telmion® (Hoechst) or esterified vegetable oils such as Actirob B® (Novance) or Hasten® (Victorian Chemicals), inorganic compounds such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and fertilizers or hydrotropics.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also comprise, as component h), additional water.<br>
Particular preference is given to liquid formulations according to tfie invention which, as component a), comprise a sodium dialkylsulfosuccinate such as Triton® and, as component b), one or more sulfonylureas from the group consisting of iodosulfuron-methyl, mesosulfuron-methyl, foramsulfuron, ethoxysulfuron or amidcsulfuron and/or salts thereof, for example alkali metal salts, such as sodium salts, or ammonium salts, in particular quaternary ammonium salts, such as tetrabutyl ammonium salts. These particularly preferred formulations may additionally, as component el comprise one or more agrochemically active compounds from the group oonsstrng of fenoxaprop-ethyl, diflufenican, mefenpyr-diethyl and isoxadifen-ethyi.<br>
Liquid formulations according to the invention can be present, for example, in the form of solutions, emulsion concentrates or dispersions, such as emulsions or suspensions. Here, preferably at least one active compound from the group of the ALS inhibitors, preferably at least one sulfonylurea, is present in dissolved form. In a particularly preferred embodiment, all active compound ingredients are dissolved.<br><br>
It is possible to convert the virtually water-free solutions according to the invention by addition of water into microemulsions, macroemulsions or water-containing solutions. Thus, in addition to virtually water-free solutions (for example in organic solvents or in the derivatives of polycarboxylic acids obtained according to the invention), the present invention also embraces water-containing formulations such as 0/W and W/0 microemulsions or EW and EO macroemulsions.<br>
By incorporating active compounds or components which are insoluble in the continuous phase into the formulations, suspensions are obtained. Accordingly, the present invention also embraces such suspensions.<br>
On dilution with water, the formulations according to the invention give dispersions or else water-containing solutions, which are likewise embraced by the present invention.<br>
The content of active compound in the formulations according to the invention is generally between 0.001% by weight and 50% by weight, higher loads being possible in individual cases, in particular when a plurality of active compounds is used. Since ALS inhibitors are highly effective active compounds, the preferred application rates are usually between 1 and 50 g of a.i./ha, i.e. even these extremely low application rates result in a massive intervention in the amino acid metabolism of the harmful plante, and the enzyme acetolactate synthase is inhibited, which in turn results in the death of the harmful plants. In general, the content of polycarboxylic acid derivatives is 0.1-80%; however, this may be higher in individual cases.<br>
The auxiliaries and addrtives which can be used for preparing the formulations according to tne Invention, such as, for example, surfactants and solvents, are known in principle and are described, for example, in; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annua’. MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Sunace Active Agents", Chem. Publ.Co,Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-Active Ethylene Oxide Adducts], Wiss. Veriagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], volume 7, C.Hauser-Veriag, Munich, 4th edition 1986.<br><br>
Preferred ratios of the components a):b) in the liquid formulations according to the invention, in particular in emulsion concentrates, are 1:0.1-1:100, preferably 1:1 to 1:20, for example about 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7 or 1:10.<br>
Liquid formulations according to the invention can be prepared by customary known processes, i.e., for example, by mixing the different components with the aid of stirrers, shakers or (static) mixers. If appropriate, brief heating may be advantageous. In the case of salt-like ALS inhibitors, this simple process makes it possible to prepare the corresponding ALS inhibitor salts in situ by using, for example, nonionic surfactants in which the catalyst - generally a metal catalyst -has not been subsequently neutralized. Thus, the present invention also embraces the processes described for preparing the liquid formulations according to the invention. These processes are distinguished in particular by production-related advantages.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ALS inhibitors used, such as sulfonylureas, are inhibitors with counterions having phase-transfer properties. Such counterions are, for example, organic counterions, such as organic ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium ions. Such counterions can be incorporated in a particularly simple manner into the formulations if they are present in admixture with additional, for example nonionic, formulation components. Accordingly, the invention also embraces the incorporation of the counterions into the formulations.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention preferably comprise<br>
(a)	from 0.1 to 80% by weight, preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, of derivatives of polycarboxylic acids, in particular one or more compounds from the group of the gemini surfactants and/or sulfosuccinates,<br>
(b)	from 0.001 to 50% by weight, preferably from 1 to 15% by weight, of herbicidally active compound from the group of the ALS inhibitors, preferably from the group of the sulfonylureas,<br>
(c)	from 0 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 50% by weight, of further surfactants and/or polymers,<br>
(d)	from 0 to 90% by weight, preferably from 1 to 30% by weight, of organic solvents.<br>
(e)	from 0 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0 to 30% by weight, of agrochemicals which are different from ALS inhibitors,<br><br>
(f)    from 0 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0 to 10% by weight, of customary<br>
formulation auxiliaries, and (h)    from 0 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0 to 10% by weight, of additional<br>
water.<br>
Particularly preferred formulations according to the invention are water-free emulsion concentrates, comprising<br>
(a)	from 10 to 60% by weight of derivatives of polycarboxylic acids, in particular one or more compounds from the group of the gemini surfactants and/or sulfosuccinates,<br>
(b)	from 1 to 15% by weight of herbicidally active compounds of the type of the ALS inhibitors, in particular from the group of the sulfonylureas,<br>
(c)	from 0 to 50% by weight of further surfactants and/or polymers,<br>
(d)	from 0 to 30% by weight of organic solvents,<br>
(e)	from 0 to 50% by weight of agrochemicals which are different from ALS inhibitors and<br>
(f)	from 0 to 10% by weight of customary formulation auxiliaries.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be used, for example, for controlling undesirable vegetation. To this end, an effective amount of the formulation according to the invention is, if required after dilution with water, applied to the seeds, plants, parts of plants or the area unaer cultivation.<br>
The formulations according to the invention are formufations wfiich are physically and chemically stable and which, on dilution with wasr. give soray liquors having favorable physical performance characteristics. In addition, the formulations according to the invention have favorable bioiogical properties and can be used widely, for example for controlling undesirable vegetation.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The stated amounts of the components listed in Table 1 were mixed with one another and, in the case of Examples XII to XIV, subsequently ground. The initial values and final values (g of sulfonylurea in the formulation) were determined by HPLC. In Examples l-XI and XV, emulsion concentrates were obtained; in Examples XII-XIV, dispersions were obtained. The examples show that derivatives of polycarboxylic acids, in particular of the type of the sulfosuccinates, have a stabilizing effect on liquid sulfonylurea formulations. The formulations according to the invention may also comprise solvents (Examples IV-Vil), commercial adjuvants (Examples X and XI), nonionic surfactants (Example IX) or dispersed surfactant components (Examples XII, XIII and XIV). In addition to stable "one-active-compound formulations", the formulations according to the invention may also be formulations comprising two, three or more active compounds.<br>

Comparative Examples<br>
The stated amounts of iodosulfuron, fenoxaprop-ethyl, mefenpyr-diethyl and propylene carbonate were mixed. The initial values and final values (g of iodosulfuron in the formulation) were determined by HPLC. What is obtained is not a stable formulation but a system which is unstable on storage as is evident from Table 2 (Example 1). If a surfactant component such as Genapoi X-060® is added, the storage stability is reduced even further (Example 2).<br>
