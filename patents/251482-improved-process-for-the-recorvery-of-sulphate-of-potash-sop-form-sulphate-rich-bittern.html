				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an integrated process for the recovery of sulphate of potash (SOP) from sulphate rich bittern. The process requires only bittern and lime as raw materials. Kainite type mixed salt is obtained by fractional crystallization of the bittern. Kainite is converted into schoenite with simultaneous removal of NaCl in a single step and the filtrate (SEL) is used for production of KCl. The schoenite is reacted with aqueous KCl to yield SOP and the filtrate (KEL) is recycled in the kainite to schoenite conversion step. The production of KCl from SEL is carried out with the aid of DPA. Lime is treated with DPA in water for the production of highly soluble Ca(DPA)2, which in turn treated with SEL to produce insoluble K(DPA) with &gt;95% yield. The isolated K(DPA) is treated with 1:1 HCl to produce KCl and insoluble DPA, which can be recycled for the production of Ca(DPA)2. The aqueous KCl thus obtained is treated with schoenite to prepare SOP, purity 90-92%. The KEL obtained along with SOP is recycled to generate schoenite. Utilisation of all effluent and intermediate streams allow for an overall SOP yield &gt;89% w.r.t. the potash content in the mixed salt.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel integrated process for the production of sulphate of potash (SOP) from sulphate-rich bittern More specifically the process relates to recovery of KC1 in concentrated solution form from liquid effluent generated during transformation of kainite into schoenite using dipicrylamine as recyclable extractant and use of the KC1 solution as per the known prior art for preparation of sulphate of potash from schoenite<br>
SOP is a dual fertilizer containing 50% K2O and 18% Sulphur It has the lowest salt index and is virtually free of chloride, which makes it a superior fertilizer to muriate of potash (MOP) On the other hand, MOP is easy to produce especially when brine/bittern is low in sulphate content such as in the Dead Sea and this accounts for its lower price compared to SOP Countries such as India, which do not have low sulphate bittern, but which have adequate bittern of sea and sub-soil origin, would be greatly benefited if SOP can be produced economically from such bittern sources Besides its application as a fertilizer, potassium sulphate has numerous industrial applications as well<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference may be made to the well-known Mannheim process involving reaction of MOP with sulphuric acid The major problem with the process is that it is energy intensive and poses a problem of hydrochloric acid (HC1) management when no application of commensurate volume for HC1 is available in the vicinity In a paper entitled "Production of potassium sulphate by an ammomation process", Chemical Engineer, 349, pp 688-690, October 1979, by J A Fernandez Lozano and A Wint, describes the process of SOP manufacture from MOP through reaction with gypsum in presence of ammonia The principle of the process is the double decomposition reaction between gypsum and potassium chloride in presence of ammonia at 0°C The main disadvantage of the process is that it is energy intensive and necessitates careful design of the reactor for safe operation In a paper entitled "Messo pilots new potassium sulphate process', Phosphorous &amp; Potassium, l78, March-April 1992, p-20, by H   Scherzberg et al     describe the successful trials on a process involving reaction of MOP with sodium sulphate to produce the double salt glasente (3K2SO4 Na2SO4)   The glasente is in turn reacted with MOP to produce SOP   The mam disadvantage of the process is that it would<br>
be unsuitable for those who do not have access to such raw materials Moreover, the process involves several complex unit operations including the need for chilling Such processes have their limitation on large scale<br>
In a paper entitled 'Duisberg's alternative to Mannheim', Phosphorous &amp; Potassium,\l%, March-April 1992, p-20, by H Scherzberg and R Schmitz describe an integrated process for production of SOP from KC1 and MgSO4 or Na2SO4 The main drawback of the process is that the amount of NaCl in raw materials has a critical effect on the process and, as such, would be less applicable to crude mixed salt as obtained from sea bittern Another disadvantage is that the process involves heating and cooling which makes it energy intensive Yet another disadvantage is that the by-product obtained is MgCl2 in concentrated solution form which has a limited market and lower appeal compared to low B2O3 containing Mg(OH)2 solid produced as part of the integrated process of the present invention In a paper entitled 'Mixed Salt from Sea Bittern', Salt Research &amp; Industry, 2, 126-128,1969 byG D Bhattetal have described the process of manufacture of mixed salt, 1 e, comprising a mixture of NaCl arid kainite (KC1 MgSO4 3H2O), from sea bittern through solar evaporation and fractional crystallisation In a paper entitled "Preparation of syngenite from mixed salt in pure form in Salt Research &amp; Industry, Vol 6, No 14, 1969 by KPPatel and the paper entitled "Potassium Sulphate from Syngenite" by K P Patel, R P Vyas and K Seshadn, in Salt Research &amp; Industry, Vol 6, No 2, April 1969, wherein a process for preparation of SOP by leaching syngenite (K2SO4 CaSO4 H2O) with hot water and then recovering it by solar evaporation is described The main drawback of the process is that it is energy intensive Moreover, production of syngenite from mixed salt is itself an involved affair<br>
In a paper entitled "Manufacture of Potassium chloride and byproducts from Sea Bittern " by K Seshadn et al mSalt Research and Industry, April-July 1970, Vol 7, page 39-44, wherein mixed salt (NaCl and kainite) obtained from bittern is dispersed with high density bittern in proper proportion and heated to a temperature of 110°C when kiesente (MgSO4 H2O) is formed which is separated by filtering the slurry under hot conditions The filtrate is cooled to ambient temperature, when carnallite crystallizes out Carnallite is decomposed with water to get a solid mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride while magnesium chloride goes into solution Solid mixture of potassium chloride and sodium chloride is purified using<br>
known techniques to produce pure potassium chloride The drawbacks of this process are that it fails to make use of the sulphate content in bittern and, instead, offers an elaborate process for manufacture of MOP, which, in any case, is inferior to SOP as fertilizer<br>
US Patent Application Number 2003 0080066 dated October 29, 2001 by Vohra, Rajinder N et al wherein an integrated process is revealed for recovery of high purity salt, potassium chloride, and end bittern containing 7 5 gpl Bromine The process is based on desulphatation of brine with distiller waste of soda ash industry or calcium chloride generated from limestone and acid The mam drawback of the patent application is that the process is less attractive when distiller waste is not available in the vicinity and the process becomes less economical when carnalhte has to be obtained from bittern without production of industrial grade salt Moreover, as in the case referred to above, it is desirable to utilize the sulphate content in bittern and produce SOP in preference to MOP<br>
In a paper entitled 'Great Salt Lake-A fertile harvest for IMC in Phosphorus &amp; Potassium, 225, Jan-Feb, 2000 by Michael Freeman, have described the process which comprises of concentrating the brine containing 0 2-0 4% KC1, harvesting mixed salt, separation of high sodium chloride fraction through floatation, leaching with sulphate rich brine to produce schoenite, hot water dissolution of schoenite, fractional crystallization of SOP and recycling of mother liquor containing up to 30% of original K to evaporation pond The mam drawbacks of the process are (I) the need for floatation which involves use of organic chemicals whose disposal is problematic, (n) need for external heat for the purpose of recovery of SOP from schoenite through fractional crystallization at elevated temperature, (in) need for recycling of as much as 30% of K to evaporation ponds where agam it gets contaminated with other components of the brine<br>
In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Sixth Edition, 1999, under the Chapter, Potassium compounds, a description of a process for production of SOP in Sicily is detailed Kaimte (KC1   MgSO4   2 75 H20), is obtained from a potash ore<br>
by flotation It is then converted into schoenite at ca 25 °C by stirring with mother liquor containing the sulfates of potassium and magnesium from the later stages of the process Schoenite is filtered off and decomposed with water at ca 48 °C This causes magnesium sulfate and part of the potassium sulfate to dissolve and most of<br>
the potassium sulfate to crystallize The crystals are filtered and dried The sulfate mother liquor is recycled to the kainite - schoemte conversion stage The mam drawbacks of the process are that there is no mention of the fate of the mother liquor obtained upon conversion of kainite into schoemte which would inevitably entail considerable loss of K, and the need for external source of heat to effect the fractional crystallization of SOP<br>
Chinese patent CN 2000-112497, 29 Aug 2000, by Song, Wenyi, et al, entitled "Method for preparing K2SO4 from sulphate type K-contaming bittern " The method comprises concentrating the bittern, separating NaCl, concentrating to obtain crude K-Mg salt containing 10-45% NaCl, crushing, mixing with saturated bittern to obtain a solution with concentration of 20-40%, removing NaCl by back-floatation, concentrating, dewatenng to obtain refined K-Mg salt containing less than 5% NaCl, mixing the K-Mg salt and water at specified ratio, allowing the mixture to react at 10-60°F for 0 5-3hr, separating to obtain schoemte, mixing with KCl and water at specified ratio, allowing the mixture to react at 10-70°F for 0 25-3hr and separating to obtain K2SO4 The drawbacks of the process are (1) need for elaborate method of purification of mixed salt that includes removing NaCl by the less desirable method of back floatation that involves use of organic chemicals, (11) lack of any mention of the manner in which the various effluent streams are dealt with, and (111) dependence on outsourced KCl since no mention is made of any process for KCl production as part of the process<br>
In a paper entitled "Extraction of Potash and other Constituents from sea water Bittern" in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol 10,No 2,1918, pp 96-106, by J H Hildebrand wherein theoretical aspects of the recovery of potash from sea bittern are described and a process for extraction is proposed According to this process, bittern is evaporated at a temperature between 100-120°C, thereby forming a solid mixture of sodium chloride and kiesente (MgSO4 H2O), separating this mixture under hot conditions in a heated centrifuge, and cooling the mother liquor in a cooler for separation of carnallite Carnalhte is decomposed and washed with water to produce potassium chloride The drawback of this process is that it is demanding in terms of energy requirement and sufficiently pure carnallite cannot be obtained The main drawback of the process is the contamination of kiesente with NaCl which would necessitate further purification to obtain products in saleable<br>
form Another drawback of the process is that it requires energy to remove sulphate from bittern in the form of kiesente whereas it would be preferable to utilize the sulphate for the production of SOP<br>
In yet another paper entitled "Production of Potassium Sulphate from Mixed Salt" in Salt Research &amp; Industry, Vol 2, No 4, October 1965, by D J Mehta et al describes a process of floatation technique for the production of potassium sulphate from two types of mixed salt available from the salt works of the Little Rann of Kutch is described The process suffers from the drawback of lack of suitability when high sulphate containing sea bittern is used and the need for froth floatation, which is costly, cumbersome and polluting<br>
In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Sixth Edition, 2002 (Electronic Version) dealing with Magnesium Compounds written by Margarete Seeger, Walter Otto, Wilhelm Flich, Friednch Bickelhaupt and Otto S Akkerman, wherein the process of preparation of magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described It is mentioned therein that preparation of low boron containing magnesia requires over liming of the seawater up to pH 12 to maintain B2O3 content less than 0 05% in magnesia Over liming involves higher lime cost, need for neutralization of supernatant and results in a colloidal suspension which is not easy to filter Another drawback is a lack of application of calcium chloride-containing effluent, which is discharged back into the sea<br>
Reference may be made to the Canadian patent entitled, "Process for the manufacture of potassium sulphate by treatment of solution containing magnesium chloride and potassium chloride", application No 423211, CA 1203666, by Wendhng et al wherein a process for the production of potassium sulphate from solutions containing magnesium chloride, such as solutions of carnalhte ore and, in particular, the equilibrium mother liquors of a unit for the treatment of carnalhte is described According to this process, sodium sulphate and potassium chloride are added to the solutions containing magnesium chloride, so as to precipitate sodium chloride and schoenite, K2SO4MgSO46H2O, and the schoenite obtained is treated in a known manner to produce potassium sulphate The main drawback of the process is the need to outsource sodium sulphate and the lack of any mention of a solution to the problem of KC1 loss in effluent streams<br>
In a paper entitled "Recovery of Potassium Salts from Bittern by Potassium Pentaborate Crystallisation' in Separation Science &amp; Technology, 31(6), 1996, pp 857-870, by H Gurbuz et al wherein sodium pentaborate is prepared from the reaction of Tincal and recycled H3BO3 in presence of water and thereafter treated with bittern to selectively precipitate out potassium pentaborate, which in turn is acidulated with sulphuric acid and fractionally crystallized to remove K2SO4 and recycle the H3BO3 in the process The main drawbacks of the process are that the mother liquor contains significant quantities of boron which entails elaborate procedure to recover boron and, moreover, the MgO obtained from such mother liquor would be unfit for industrial use Moreover, although such a process can still be thought of for sulphate poor bittern, it would not be a preferred route when the bittern is rich in sulphate content Yet another drawback is the need to chill the acidulated product for high yield<br>
In a paper entitled "Henry's constant for Bromine-Sea Brine systems and liquid film mass transfer coefficient for desorption of bromine from sea brine" by A S Mehta in Indian Chemical Engineer, 45(2), 2003, p 73, wherein the author describes the process of bromine manufacture from bittern Bittern is acidified with sulphuric acid to a pH of 3 0-3 5 and the bromide ion is then oxidized with chlorine and stripped off with the help of steam The acidic de-brominated bittern is neutralized with lime, the sludge thus formed removed, and the effluent discharged Reference may also be made to bromine plants located in the vicinity of natural salt beds in the Greater Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, India that utilize natural bittern for bromine production by the above method and discharge their effluent back into the Rann Disposal of sludge poses a formidable challenge in these plants In a paper entitled "Improved Treatment of Waste Brines" by Chr Balarew, D Rabadjieva and S Tepavitcharova, (International Symposium on Salt 2000, page 551-554) for recovery of marine chemicals The authors describe the use of lime for precipitation of Mg(OH)2 from a part of available bittern, and desulphatation of balance bittern with the resultant CaCl2 solution for recovery of KC1 via carnalhte The authors have not discussed any scheme of utilizing such methodology for production of SOP from sulphate-rich bittern Moreover, as will be evident later, Mg(OH)2 produced directly from raw bittern has much higher B2O3 content compared to Mg(OH)2 prepared from the Mg2+ source of the present invention, which is linked to production of SOP<br>
Chinese Patent No 1084492 assigned to Lu Zheng describes the process of manufacture of SOP from bittern and potassium chloride In this process, bittern is processed by evaporation, cooling, floatation and then it is reacted with potassium chloride to make potassium sulfate and by-products of industrial salt and residual brine The mam drawbacks of this process are that it requires involved separation techniques like floatation to remove NaCl from mixed salt and KCl required for production of SOP from schoenite has to be procured separately Moreover, although overall yield in terms of potash recovery is 95%, yield with respect to such procured KCl is not mentioned<br>
In a WO patent application No PCT / IN03/ 00463, 2003 by P K Ghosh et al describes the process of manufacture of SOP from bittern and MOP In this process, kamite-type mixed salt was produced by evaporation of sea bittern and the mixed salt was then treated with water (and also K+-nch liquor obtained during schoenite into SOP) to obtain schoenite and a by-product liquor (SEL) containing sodium, potassium and magnesium salts This liquor is then treated with CaCl2 to eliminate sulphate and then evaporated to produce carnallite which is then decomposed and hot leached to obtain KCl in solid form The schoenite is then treated with KCl and water to obtain SOP and a filtrate that can be recycled in the step involving conversion of kainite mixed salt into schoenite The drawback of this process is that the production of KCl from SEL through carnallite intermediate is lengthy, involves co-generation of Mg(OH)2, and requires evaporation of large amounts of water Thus while it is useful to generate KCl from waste, an improved process would be highly desirable<br>
In a paper entitled "Study of the Competitive Binding of Mixed Alkali and Alkali Earth Metal Ions using Dibenzo-30-Crown-10" (Polyhedron 2005, 24, pp 1023-1032) by P Agnihotn et al wherein potassium rich bitterns were treated with the crown hgand to extract out potassium selectively Reference is also made to other references contained in the paper The drawbacks of the process are the relatively low selectivity of these ligands and difficulties around regeneration of the hgand In a paper entitled "The quantitative determination of potassium with hexamtro diphenylamine (dipicryal amine)" in Angewandte Chemie, 49(46), pp 827-30, 1936 by A Winkel et al In this method Mg-dipicryalaminate, which is highly soluble in water, is used to prepare insoluble K- dipicryalammate The main draw back of this<br>
process is that the inventors have not revealed the recovery of K+ and recycling of dipicryalamine (DPA) from K- dipicryalaminate<br>
Australian patent AU 109552, 1940 "Potassium salts", assigned to J Kielland, describes the recovery of potassium from brine with the aid of dipicrylamine Ca2+ salt of dipicrylamine was added to brine, the precipitated K-dipicrylaminate is separated and treated with mineral acids, which liberated dipicrylamine for further use The drawbacks of this process are that no distinct advantage in undertaking such extraction is disclosed<br>
German patent DE 726545, 1942 "Extracting potassium from dilute solutions, e g, sea water", assigned to E Berner, and J Kielland, describes the use of highly nitrated, secondary aromatic amines, e g, hexanitromethyldiphenylamine or pentanitromethyldiphenyl-amine for the extraction of potassium The drawbacks of this process are that isolation of solid salt from the dilute aqueous solution is energy intensive and no definite advantage was undertaken for direct use of the aqueous solution<br>
Great Britain patent No GB 605694, 1948 "Recovery of potassium salts" describes the process of recovery of K+ salt from sea water using dipicrylamine Sea water was treated with a solution of Ca-dipicrylaminate, whereby insoluble K-dipicrylaminate was filtered and treated with a mineral acid such that the K+ goes into solution while dipicrylamine remains as solid, which was recycled The main drawback of this process is that there is no report to use this methodology for the preparation of KC1 solution for the explicit purpose of utilizing it for SOP production<br>
In a paper entitled "Extraction of potassium salts from saline mother liquors by hexanitrodiphenylamine II", Ann Chim (Rome), 51, pp 645-55, 1961 by F Massazza, and B Riva, the extraction of potassium salts from saline mother liquors by hexanitrodiphenylamine is described The precipitated K-dipicrylaminate was treated with HNO3, which formed KNO3 and regenerated dipicryalamine The main drawback of this process is that it has been exclusively used for the preparation of potassium nitrate and no report to use of this methodology for preparation of aqueous KC1 to use it for SOP production<br>

The following examples are given as way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention<br>
EXAMPLE 1 This example summarizes the novel SOP production process from kainite type mixed salt was produced from sea bittern and the end bittern was kept aside   The<br>
mixed salt was treated with appropriate quantity of water, and KEL obtained in the process below, and the slurry was filtered to yield schoenite and a filtrate (SEL) rich in KCl but which also contained other constituents, namely NaCl, MgSO4, and MgCl2 The schoenite was treated with solution of MOP in water under agitation The slurry was filtered to obtain SOP and a filtrate (KEL) rich in KCl which is recycled for schoenite production End bittern obtained during mixed salt production was desulphated and treated with lime and the slurry filtered to obtain Mg(OH)2 and CaCl2-containing filtrate which was used to desulphate SEL Desulphated SEL was mixed with desulphated end bittern and evaporated to obtain carnallite The carnallite was decomposed to obtain carnalhte decomposed product which was then subjected to hot leaching to obtain KCl solid The schoenite was then treated with the KCl and water to obtain SOP as described above This example teaches us that although recovery of solid KCl and magnesium hydroxide from SEL is feasible and eliminates the need for outsourced KCl, recovery of such KCl is a tedious process and is economical only when the intention is to recover Mg(OH)2 simultaneously Since there can be a mismatch in demand for SOP and Mg(OH)2, an alternative process of recovery of KCl from SEL is desirable that eliminates the need to produce Mg(OH)2 simultaneously Another important drawback is the requirement of heating and also evaporation of large amounts of water The example further teaches us that water needs to be added into the mixture of schoenite and KCl to produce SOP and that there is an opportunity to devise a process wherein the KCl is obtained in solution form with accompanying benefits of easier processing and elimination of additional requirement of water<br>
EXAMPLE-2 KCl is recovered from SEL by the alternative route of the present Example that overcomes the drawbacks referred to in Example 1 100 g of DPA (0 228 mol) was reacted under ambient conditions with lime slurry containing 6 4 g (0 114 mol) of lime and 400 mL of water The reddish brown solution of Ca(DPA)2 thus obtained was added under stirring into 200 mL of SEL containing 13 2 % NaCl, (0 226 mol%), 8 85% KCl (0 119 mol%), 5 6% of MgCl2 (0 059 mol%) and 14 5% of MgSO4 (0 121 mol%) over a period of 5 minute Stirring was continued for 10 minutes The precipitate of K(DPA) and CaSO4 formed was filtered and washed with water (3x20 mL) It was treated with 80 mL of 5 N HC1 under mechanical stirring for 2 hrs and the resultant solution of KCl   was filtered and washed with<br><br>
water (3x25 mL)   The residue containing DPA and CaSO4, was again treated with lime to regenerate Ca(DPA)2 while stoichiometric amount of concentrated HC1 was added into the washings for demetallation of K(DPA) in the second cycle   After five cycles, 600 mL of KCl solution was obtained whose pH was adjusted to 7 0 This solution analyzed as KCl  12 5% (0 168 mol%), NaCl 0 17% (0 003 mol%), Ca2+ 0 18% (0 005 mol%), Mg2+ 0 005% (0 0002 mol%)   The solution was then added into 200 g of schoenite and stirred for 4 5 h 60 g of SOP (33% yield w r t total K2O) was obtained having the following analysis NaCl 0 24 % (0 004 mol%), K2SO4 90 1 % (0 518 mol%), CaSO4 7 96 % (0 058 mol%) Example 1 teaches us that although recovery of KCl with respect to K2O in SEL was 83 6%, the mam drawbacks are (1) 15% loss of DPA after 5 cycles, (11) KCl solution recovered by DPA extraction method is too dilute which causes low yield (33%) of SOP, and (111) there is as much as 8% gypsum impurity in the SOP<br>
EXAMPLE 3 The experiment of Example 2 was carried out again with 88 g of DPA and 170 mL of SEL having the following composition NaCl 12 5% (0 214 mol%), KCl 8 7% (0 116 mol%), MgCl2 4 5% (0 047 mol%) and MgSO4 18 7% (0 155 mol)% However, the KCl solution obtained had a concentration of 16%, which was made possible by taking twofold excess volume of 5N HC1 which facilitated washmg with reduced amount of water and thereby to minimize the overall volume After three cycles, 250 ml of solution containing 40 g of KCl (0 537 mol) was obtained, with 86 3% recovery with respect to K2O in SEL This KCl solution was treated with 112 g of schoenite and stirred for 4 5 h The precipitated SOP was isolated and dried to yield 60 g (57 9% yield w r t total K20) of SOP However, the purity of SOP was still low at 90 1% and overall 15% loss of DPA was observed The present example teaches us a means of increasing the KCl concentration in solution to enhance SOP yield<br>
EXAMPLE 4 The experiment of Example 3 was repeated and KCl solution having 18 4% concentration was obtained from SEL The former was treated with a small quantity of schoenite to remove Ca2+ impurity in the solution in the form of CaSO4 SOP prepared as described above using this KCl solution had purity of 92 5% with considerably reduced gypsum contamination (2 3%)<br>
Examples 2 and 4 teach us that calcium contamination of KCl solution obtained from SEL can lower purity of SOP and that such Ca2+ ions can be removed by treating the solution with a small quantitative of schoenite, filtering the solution and then finally treating with the required quantity of schoenite to produce SOP<br>
EXAMPLE 5 The experiment of Example 4 was repeated with one modification, namely, the decomposition of K(DPA) with excess HC1 was followed by further treatment of the residue with excess HNO3 solution The acid solutions containing potassium salt from the decomposition of K(DPA) were recycled in subsequent batches The loss of DP after five cycles was found to be 5%<br>
This Example teaches us that HNO3 can effect more complete decomposition of K(DPA) and DPA loss is cut down from 15% to 5% after five cycles, and the latter loss mainly is due to handling losses The KNO3 solution can be made close to the saturation limit of this salt which can be then used for efficient recovery of solid KNO3 or the solution can be used directly for appropriate applications<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
This Example shows us the optimum working of the invention 60 ml of SEL (containing 10 1% KCl) was treated with stoichiometric (wrt K2O) quantity of Ca(DPA)2 prepared from 35 g of DPA and the resultant precipitate of K(DPA) was treated successively with aqueous HC1 and HNO3 solutions The KCl solution obtained was treated with 0 6g of schoenite and filtered to remove CaSO4 The filtered solution containing 17 8% KCl was added to 13 1 g of schoenite and stirred for 4 5 h The precipitated SOP was isolated by filtration and dried to yield 7 4 g (59 2% w r t total K2O) of SOP with 93 5% purity, the impurities being NaCl (1 4 %), CaSO4 (0 5 %) and MgSO4 (3 3%) The 34 ml of KEL containing 12 0 % KCl, 12 5% MgSO4 and only 0 7% NaCl is recycled in the step of mixed salt to schoenite conversion  DPA recovery was 99% and it is recycled in the subsequent batches<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
