SLIDER CUM RECLINER FOR AUTOMOTIVE SEATS<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to automotive seats and in particular to a slider cum recliner. The present invention more particularly relates to a slider cum recliner with reduced operable sliding friction and robust slider locking means.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
All vehicles require a slider and recliner mechanism that provides fore and aft movement of the seat and forward and rearward tilting of the seat back. The slider and recliner play a major part in the ergonomic functions of the seats. The assembly also becomes safety critical because in the event of a collision the assembly should be able to with stand the impact forces that act on the seat and thus on the assembly, without any major deformations or breakage.<br>
Typical seat slider and recliners are complicated and expensive due to having more number of parts and thus making the assembly difficult to manufactures. Slider assemblies with typical internal locking systems have a single side locking which results in weak locking and also could lead to the teeth slipping out upon being subjected to high stresses.<br>
US patent 6,561,587 discloses a variable clutching seat recliner apparatus includes a drum coupled to a seat back, a band wrapped about the drum inhibiting rotation thereof, a tightening mechanism coupled to opposed ends of the band such that a force applied to the seat back in either of two opposing directions produces a tension in the band adjacent either end and a corresponding loosening of the band adjacent the other end. The tightening mechanism includes a lever pivotable about a fixed pivot point to convert a portion of the tension to reduce the loosening, and a variable control mechanism positioned proximate the lever for limiting pivotal movement of the lever.<br>
US Patent 6,155,644 discloses an apparatus for allowing pivotal movement of a top portion of a seat relative to a bottom portion, is provided. The apparatus includes a mounting bracket, a fixed portion, and a rack portion. The mounting bracket is mounted to the bottom portion of the seat. The fixed portion has a plurality of fixed portion teeth extending from the fixed portion base and is mounted to the mounting bracket. The rack portion has a plurality of base portion teeth extending from the base portion towards the<br><br>
fixed portion. The end portion of the rack portion is pivotally connected to the top portion. An engaging member is pivotally connected to the mounting bracket. The engaging member moves the rack portion in a direction generally toward the rack portion and to lock the rack portion and the fixed portion in an engaged relationship in response to movement of a handle in one direction. A disengaging member is pivotally connected to the mounting bracket. The disengaging member moves the rack portion in a direction generally away from the engaging member to unlock the apparatus.<br>
US Patent 4,756,503 discloses "Slide device for an automotive seat" which is capable of adjusting the positions of the seat forwardly and backwardly. In the slide device, an upper rail provided on the side of the seat is slidably mounted via a slider to a lower rail provided on the side of floor of the automobile. The slider comprises of a plate spring which is provided with the upper rail. That is, the projected portions of the plate spring prevents the generation of play of the upper rail in the vertical direction as well as in the right and left direction as well.<br>
The above system of an automotive seat slider provides a sliding effect by virtue of rollers on which the upper rails are disposed resulting in rolling friction causing wear and tear of the components as well as an increase in force necessary for achieving the sliding effect. Objects of the invention<br>
The primary object to the present invention is to provide a slider cum recliner for automotive seats with reduced operable sliding friction and robust slider locking means.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a slider cum recliner with a friction-less and compact sliding arrangement.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a slider cum recliner with a robust internal locking means to provide strength and fool-proof locking.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a slider cum recliner with a locking lever and a locking plate to effect dual locking.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a slider cum recliner comprising both seat slider and recliner in a single embodiment for easy assembly and strength.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a slider cum recliner with a reduced part count.<br><br>
It is also an object of this invention to provide a slider cum recliner which can be adapted for twin-sided locking application for higher user safety.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a seat slider cum recliner that has a provision for the anchoring of the seat belt on the assembly for maximum user comfort and safety. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a slider cum recliner with a robust locking mechanism for automotive seats, which permits the fore and aft movement of the seat bottom and pivotal movement of the seat back. The slider assembly includes a pair of U-shaped lower rails having semi-cylindrical outer passages and receptors; said lower rails are secured to the floor panel through floor mounting brackets. The slider assembly also includes a pair of upper rails to which the seat bottom is secured through the cushion mounting brackets. The upper rails are supported for sliding movement relative to the lower rail. The sliding activity is effected by a friction- free integration of sliding upper rails and fixed lower rails. The friction free movement is achieved by means of an arrangement having spherical mass bodies disposed inside the cylindrical hollow passages formed at meeting point of semi-cylindrical hollow passages of both upper and lower rails. A slider latch mechanism with a locking lever and a lock plate, which is pivotally attached to the upper brackets, is provided for locking the slider assembly. Actuation of the slider latch mechanism by means of the towel bar releases the upper brackets from the locked position and permits fore and aft movement of the seat. Release of the towel bar when the seat reaches the desired position locks the seat at that desired position. The seat recliner assembly includes a pair of plate bases that is integrated with the upper rails of each slider. These plates are provided with a profile projection acting as a stopper to provide a dead-end stop to the recliner movement. Brief description of the diagrams<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a slider cum recliner with a friction-less sliding arrangement and a robust locking means for automotive seats, which permits the fore and aft movement of the seat bottom and pivotal movement of the seat back. The preferred embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the accompanied diagrams.<br>
Initially, referring to Figs 1 and 2, a slider cum recliner as shown comprises an outer slider-cum-recliner assembly (1) and an inner slider-cum-recliner assembly (2). The outer and inner assemblies (1 &amp; 2) mounted on the outer and inner side of the automotive seat (3) respectively. The automotive seat (3) has a back-rest (4) and a seat-cushion (5). The inner and outer assemblies (1 &amp; 2) are interconnected through the seat-cushion (5) by means of a connecting rod (6) (as shown in Fig 5). The Inner and Outer assemblies of said slider cum recliner (1 &amp; 2) are further divided into the Inner slider assembly (7), Outer slider assembly (8), Outer recliner assembly (9) and Inner recliner assembly (10). The outer assembly (1) comprises a master side of the slider cum recliner disposed on outer side of the seat and the inner assembly (2) comprising an idler side of the slider and recliner assembly, disposed on the other side of the seat.<br><br>
Slider assembly:<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the slider assembly (7) and (8) is connected to the floor panel through floor mounting brackets (11,12,13 &amp; 14). The slider assembly (7) and (8) comprises a pair of U-shaped lower rails (15) and a sliding pair of upper rails (16). An upper (16) and a lower rail (15) of said slider assembly forming a part of the outer assembly (1) disposed on the outer side of the seat and the other pair of upper and lower rail forming part of the inner assembly (2) disposed on the inner side of the automotive seat (3).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, by referring to Fig 5 &amp; 6, a single member of pair of upper and lower rails is depicted. The pair of U-shaped lower rails (15) is endowed with intermittently placed receptors (32) (as shown in Fig 7) disposed on both inner faces of the lower rails (15), said U-shaped lower rails (15) further comprising hollow outer-side projections (23) that are disposed on both the sides of the U-shaped lower rails (15) extending along the length of the slider assembly. These outer-side projections (23) are disposed in manner to provide outwardly projecting semi-cylindrical passages (23). A pair of sliding upper rails (16) with inwardly disposed semi-cylindrical passages (24 &amp; 25). The upper portion of the upper rail (16) is fixed to the seat-cushion (5) by means of mounting-brackets (19, 20, 21 &amp; 22). The lower portion of the upper rail (16) is also provided with a flange (26) with a profile to strengthen the upper rail (16) as well as to improve the manufacturability of the upper bracket components. By virtue of the semi-cylindrical passages disposed on the lower and upper rails (15 &amp; 16) the pullout strength of the upper rail (16) with respect to the lower rail (15) is improved.<br>
The upper rails (16) are constrained to slide inside the lower rails (15). As a result of the integration of the outwardly disposed semi-cylindrical passages (23) and inwardly disposed semi-cylindrical passages (24 &amp; 25) a pair of cylindrical through passages (78) extending from one end of the lower rail (15) to the other is formed. The cylindrical through-passages (78) accommodate the sliding means to provide the fore and aft movement to the slider assembly (1) and (2) of the seat. By virtue of the presence of said sliding means the upper rails (16) can smoothly slide inside the lower rails (15). The sliding means includes a plurality of spherical mass bodies (17), pr34eferably ball<br><br>
bearings, disposed inside the cylindrical through passages (78). The spherical mass bodies (17) are restricted to the far ends of the cylindrical through passages (78) and are interspaced using a spacer (18) (as shown in Fig 3). The spacer (18) acts as a separator for the mass bodies (17). The material for the spacer is selected from plastic, nylon, preferably<br>
plastic.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein by referring to Figures 1, 3 and 7 a robust internal dual locking means of the slider assembly (1) and (2) is explained. The locking means is disposed in the upper rail (16) said locking means comprising a locking lever (29), constrained for pivotal movement at the hinge (30), and a lock plate (31), which is rigidly attached to the locking lever (29). The lock plate (31) and the locking lever (29) are integrated in a manner wherein the receptors (32) acting as locking teeth are sandwiched between the locking lever (29) and lock plate (31) at the area of contact to provide both locking and unlocking of the locking means. The lock plate (31) is provided with slots (33) which are designed to mesh with the receptors (32) on both sides of the lower rails (15) resulting in a robust locking means.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the locking mechanism of the slider cum recliner of the present invention is explained in more detail by referring to in Fig 8, wherein a three-dimensional view of the locking and unlocking mechanism is depicted. Under normal conditions i.e., when the slider assembly is locked, the locking lever (29) engages the lock plate (31) with the receptors (32) of the lower rails (15) thereby locking the slider. When the desired actuation of towel bar (36) (as shown in Fig. 3) occurs, the lock plate (31) disengages from the receptors (32) by virtue of which the upper rails (16) (as shown in Fig 1) can slide within the lower rails (15). Subsequent to arrival at the desired sliding position, on release of towel bar (36) the lock plate (31) engages with the receptors (32) to provide locking of the slider assembly.<br>
In another embodiment, to prevent slippage of the locking lever (29) and to bias towards a locked condition a retainer spring (34) (as shown in Fig 3) is disposed so that slots (33) of the lock plate (31) remain meshed with the receptors (32).<br>
Referring to Fig 1, 3 and 7, Fig 7 shows the working of the locking mechanism (27), said locking mechanism (27) comprises a pivot pin (35) which is attached to the<br><br>
locking lever (29) and is constrained to move in the slot provided in the upper rails (16) so as to limit the pivotal movement of the locking lever (29) which is disposed within a profile (28) on the upper rail (16). The locking lever (29) is actuated by a towel bar (36) which is connected to the upper bracket by means of towel bar bracket (37) which is supported for pivotal movement by means of the hinge (38). The towel bar (36) is connected through the towel bar brackets (37) to both the inner and outer assemblies such that upon actuation of the towel bar (36) the locking mechanism of both the inner and outer assemblies act in tandem to either release or lock the assembly. Actuation of the towel bar (36) causes the towel bar bracket (37) to pivotally move about the hinge (38) such that the surface (39) on the towel bar bracket (37) presses the flange (40) on the locking lever (29) and thus the lock plate (31) is unlatched from the receptor (32) of the lower rails (15) allowing fore and aft movement of the upper brackets and the seat assembly with respect to the lower rail (15). The towel bar bracket (37) and thus the towel bar (36) are biased to the unlocked condition by means of spring (41). The seat can be locked at the desired predetermined position by releasing the towel bar (36) and the locking lever (29) locks itself to the receptors (32) of the lower rail (15) through the slots (33) in the lock plate (31).<br>
The upper rail (16) is fixed with a reinforcement plate (42) having a profile (64), said reinforcement plate (42) which couples as a strengthening member for the slider assembly (1) &amp; (2) as well as a stopper to restrict the fore and aft movement of the upper brackets with respect to the lower rail (15). The lower rail (15) is fixed with end stoppers (43 &amp; 44) at both ends such that the travel movement of the upper bracket in both the fore and aft direction is restricted when the profile (64) of the reinforcement plate (42) comes in contact with the end stoppers (43 &amp; 44).<br>
The inner assembly as shown in Fig 2 includes both the inner slider assembly (7) as well as the inner recliner mechanism (10). The inner slider assembly (7) which comprises mirror image components of the outer slider assembly (8) except the towel bar (36) which acts as a common actuator. The function of the upper rails (16) of the inner slider assembly (7) is similar to that of outer slider assembly (8). The inner slider assembly (7) and the outer slider assembly (8) are coupled in such a way that both the sliders slide in tandem.<br><br>
On actuation of towel bar (36), the towel bracket (37) is pulled to exert pressure on biasing spring (41), which in turn pushes the locking lever (29) downwards resulting in unlocking of the receptors (32) from the lock plate (31). As a result, the slider assembly (1) and (2) are free to slide on the rails. The sliding activity is effected by a friction free integration of sliding upper rail (16) and fixed lower rail (15). The friction free movement is achieved by means of an arrangement having spherical mass bodies (17) disposed inside the cylindrical hollow passages (78) formed at meeting point of semi-cylindrical hollow passages of both upper and lower rails. After arriving at a desired position the towel bar (36) is released to engage the receptors (32) with the lock plate (31) to provide locking of the slider.<br>
The slider cum recliner of the present invention can also be modified to adapt to different mounting positions as required by the vehicle configuration by suitably adding brackets or by modifying the upper rail or suitably modifying the mounting brackets.<br>
The slider cum recliner of the present invention can also be modified to suit floor mounting positions of various automobiles by suitably modifying the floor mounting brackets or by varying the mounting position of the brackets.<br>
Recliner assembly:<br>
The recliner assembly as shown in Fig 1, 4 &amp; 9 comprises a recliner mechanism (45), used for selectively controlling the angular position of the seat back (4) with respect to seat-cushion (5). A sector (46), which also forms part of reclining mechanism and an outer plate base (47), which is attached to the upper rail (16) of the slider assembly through rivets (48) and plate holder (49), which encompasses the reclining mechanism (45). The sector (46) is attached to the seat back frame (4) by means of fasteners (56).<br>
The outer plate base (47) acts a base for all the recliner components, said plate base (47) has a support rib (50) which strengthens the recliner. The step (77) (as shown in Fig 10) acts as a stopper for the sector (46) which defines the dump position of the back rest.<br>
The recliner mechanism (45) further comprises a sector (46), a pawl (51), an actuation cam (52), return spring (61) and release lever (54). The sector (46) is pivotally<br><br>
hinged to the plate base (47) and plate holder (49) by means of shaft arm (55). The plate base (47) and plate holder (49), sandwich the sector (46), pawl (51) and actuation cam (52). The sector (46), one side of which is rigidly fixed to the seat back (4) by means of fasteners, has a teethed profile. The pawl (51), which is pivotally attached to the plate base (47) and plate holder (49) by means of a shaft pawl (57), has a teeth profile (58) which meshes with the corresponding teeth in the sector (46). The actuating cam (52) which is pivotally hinged to the plate base (47) and plate holder (49) by means of release shaft (59), acts to bias the pawl towards the locking position such that the teeth (58) of the pawl (57) meshes with the corresponding teeth in the sector (46). The release lever (54) is mounted on the release shaft (59) and contains a profile designed so as to engage with a mating portion of the cam (52) such that actuation of the lever release (54) causes the actuating cam (52) to rotate and thus engage and disengage the pawl (57) with respect to the sector (49), thereby allowing the seat back to be swiveled backward and forward. The release lever (54) is spring loaded by means of spring (60) which biases the actuating cam (52) to keep the pawl (57) in the locked position. When the pawl (57) is in locked position with respect to the sector (46), the seat back is in the locked condition as shown in Fig 1. The return spring (53), whose one open-end is rigidly staked in the slot of shaft arm (55) and the other open-end (62) is hooked to pin hook (63) which is rigidly attached to sector (46). The return spring (53) always biases the seatback to swivel towards the forward dump position. When the release lever (54) is operated the actuation cam (52) rotates releasing the pawl (57), thus allowing it to drop to the unlocked position thereby allowing the seat back to be swiveled to the desired position. Releasing the release lever (54) upon achieving the desired position causes the actuation cam (52) to rotate back to the locked position by means of spring thus biasing the pawl (57) to lock with the sector (46). The actuation cam (52) provides for a positive lock between the pawl (57) and sector (46).<br>
The reclining mechanism (45) also acts as a dump mechanism when the pawl (57) is kept unlocked beyond the lock position. Unlocking the pawl (57) and moving the seatback causes the teeth profile of the pawl (57) to ride over the profile on the sector (46) thus letting the seat back swivel to the forward dump position as shown in Fig 10. Swiveling the seat back to the seating position automatically locks the seat back in the first lock position.<br><br>
The shaft arm (55) is provided with an extension (65) which connects the outer recliner assembly with the inner recliner assembly by means of connecting rod (6) (as shown in Fig 5).<br>
The inner recliner assembly as shown in Fig 2 includes an inner plate base (66) connected to the upper brackets of the inner slider assembly by means of rivets, a plate holder inner (68), sector inner (69) which is supported for pivotal movement about the inner shaft arm (70) rigidly fixed to the inner plate base (66), a seat belt anchorage mechanism which is attached to the plate base (66). The inner plate base (66) is provided with a support rib (71) which acts to strengthen the recliner assembly. The sector inner (69) which is rigidly fixed to the seat back frame includes a banana slot (72) which acts to restrict the pivotal movement of the sector by means of the pin stopper (73) rigidly attached between the plate base (66) plate holder (68). Unlike the sector (69) of the outer recliner assembly the sector inner (69) of the inner recliner assembly does not contain a teethed profile as the inner sector behaves as a dummy sector acting to support the seat back frame. The seat belt anchorage mechanism (74) includes the profile (75) on the plate base (66) and an anchorage nut (76) to which the seat belt mechanism is anchored.<br>
The recliner assemblies can be adapted to act as a twin recliner with locking on both inner recliner assembly and Outer recliner assembly by introducing a locking mechanism in the Inner recliner assembly. The locking mechanisms on both inner and outer recliner assemblies can be made to act in tandem by means of a suitably adapted interconnecting mechanism. The twin recliner works in such a way that upon actuation of the release lever the locking mechanism in both the recliner unlocks in tandem permitting the swivelling on the seat back. The present invention can also be accommodated with a rotary type recliner<br>
