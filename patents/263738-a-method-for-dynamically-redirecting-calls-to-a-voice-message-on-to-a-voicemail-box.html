				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) applications. Particularly, this invention relates to Push to Talk over Cellular Applications as defined by the OMA specifications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for dynamically redirecting calls to a chosen voice message on a voicemail box (NW PoC Box), wherein the called party is available but does not wish to accept the call at the moment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Some telephone systems already have a system in place wherein a Subscriber can store different voice messages in the voicemail box for different callers, which gets played back when the called user is not answering/out of coverage area etc., alongside accepting a Voice mail from the called party. However, this arrangement requires each subscriber to store a particular voice message statically for each and every called user.<br>
The shortcoming with the above approach is that the subscriber has to associate in advance a voice message to each caller, when the caller is diverted to the voice mail system. In other words, the subscriber does not have a mechanism to dynamically redirect his call to the voicemail system, and choose a particular voice message to be played back from the list of voice messages already stored in the voicemail box.<br>
In the prior art literature, the patent titled 'Selectable voicemail greetings' describes a method for dynamically selecting a voicemail greeting to be played to a calling party. The voicemail greeting is stored in a remotely located voicemail system. The called party may actively select an appropriate voicemail greeting from a menu based on how the called party wishes to respond to the caller. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the calling party is redirected to the voicemail system using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).<br>
However, the prior art literature does not explicitly mention on How the information related to the voice message is stored in an XCAP document, and that the user can choose it depending upon the incoming caller number. Furthermore, the prior art does not explicitly say whether the user is dynamically updated when a new voice message is stored in the voicemaii system.<br>
The present invention tries to fill the voids in the state of the art literature by proposing a method for dynamically redirecting calls to a chosen voice message on a voicemaii box wherein the called party is available, but does not wish to accept the call.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary objective of the present invention to propose a method for dynamically redirecting calls to a voice message on a voicemaii box wherein the called party is available but.does not wish to accept the call.<br>
It is another object of the invention to let the caller choose the voice message he would like the NW PoC Box to play for the Calling user.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention proposes a method for dynamically redirecting calls to a NW PoC Box by choosing a particular voice message to be played from the list of voice messages stored in the NW PoC Box for an incoming call, the method comprising,<br>
•	Downloading the xml document, <poc-voice-messages-info>, and saving it in the PoC client;<br>
•	Choosing the required voice message on an incoming call, depending upon the caller, and setting up a call to the NW PoC Box to convey the same; and<br>
• Playing the chosen voice message back to the caller by the NW PoC Box.<br>
These ancl other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 depicts Example call flow showing the called user redirecting an incoming call to a particular Voice message in the NW PoC Box.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a snapshot from John's PoC Client having an incoming PoC call from George.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
This invention focuses on dynamically redirecting incoming calls to personalized voice messages stored in the Voicemail box/NW PoC Box, by the called (or invited) party.<br>
An XCAP document is stored in the NW PoC Box or the PoC XDM, which will have a list of voice messages and its associated textual description and the content URL of the voice message. A Default voice message is played by the NW PoC Box, if there are no explicit instructions to play a particular voice message by the called party (this could be the PoC Service provider provided or user's choice).<br>
For example-<br>
| Voice message 1 | I will call you back when I'm free.] j Voice message 2 | Please call me on my land line \ | Voice message 3 | I'am on vacation, please contact Richard form the Marketing team | Voice message 4 | I'm on my way, will be there soon (in German)<br>
I<br>
| Voice message 5 | {Default-from the service provider/user selected} Voice messages and their associated textual description stored in a NW PoC Box or PoC XDM (A High level view).<br><?xml version="1.0"><poc-voice-messages-info><poc-voice-message id="ald12dvbgd" type="default"><url>http://pocnetwork.com/users/john/vmbox/0001.wav</url><note>l will call you back when I'm free. </note><br></poc-voice-message><br>
m<br><poc-voice-message id="98ald 765dvbgd"><url>http://pocnetwork.com/users/john/vmbox/0002.wav</url><note> Please call me on my landline.</note></poc-voice-message><br></poc-voice-messages-info><br>
A new XML document showing Voice messages stored by user John in his NW PoC Box or PoC XDM.<br>
Figure 1 describes the following:<br>
1.	George initiates a call to John's PoC Client. (INVITE Message to the PoC server)<br>
2.	PoC server forwards the INVITE message to John's UE.<br>
3.	John's UE sends the 180 Ringing Message to the PoC Server.<br>
4.	PoC Server forwards the 180 Ringing message to George's UE.<br>
5.	After sometime, John decides to redirect the Incoming call to a Voice Message on the PoC Box, selects a Voice Message from the Popup on his phone, a 302 Response is generated (Please refer Fig. 3).<br>
6.	The PoC Sever ACK's the 302 response.<br>
7.	The PoC Server initiates an INVITE towards the redirected contact from the 302 Response, also includes all the Contact Header parameters as the Request URI parameter.<br>
8.	The NW PoC Box returns a 200 OK, to the INVITE message.<br>
9.	200 OK is forwarded to George's UE.<br>
10.	and 11) ACK forwarded from George's UE to John's UE, through the PoC Server.<br>
12. The PoC Box plays the announcement which was selected, looking at the Request URI parameters.<br>
13 and 14) George hangs up, as soon as the Voice message is played by the PoC box, not waiting to leave a Voice message to John.<br>
The above code snippet shows the .format in which the Voice messages are stored with their textual description. The URL element has the HTTP URL to the exact voice message to be played. The id attribute value is unique among all PoC-voice-message elements. It describes the following:<br>
1.	George submits the Voice message to the NW PoC Box, routed through the Aggregation proxy.<br>
2.	The Aggregation proxy routes the HTTP POST received to the NW PoC Box.<br>
3.	The NW PoC Box stores the Voice message and the Title, and responds with a HTTP 200 OK / HTTP 201 Created.<br>
4.	The Aggregation Proxy forwards the HTTP Response back to the George's Client.<br>
5.	The NW PoC Box creates a <poc-voice-message> element, inserts a unique id for the id attribute, sets the path to the new voice message, sets the title in the element and then does an XCAP PUT operation.<br>
Wofe: The XCAP PUT operation is done towards either the NW PoC Box or the PoC XDM, depending on where the PoC Voice Message document is stored. Where the PoC Voice Message Document is stored is an implementation issue.<br>
The first PoC-voice-message element (as above) has an additional attribute type-default, which indicates that it will be the default message to be played, if the Called party does not indicate explicitly to which voice message he/she wants to redirect the call. A user can select any of the voice messages to be the default voice message. There can be only one element in the document with this type-default attribute.<br>
The following paragraphs explain how the UE would interact with the NW PoC Box.<br>
1)	Post login, user downloads his <poc-voice-messages-info> document, and stores it. Also subscribes for changes in the XML document, through a SIP SUBCSRIBE.<br>
2)	The GUI in the PoC Client may provide an interface of adding/deleting Voice messages.<br>
3)	Adding/Deleting voice messages could be though other interfaces, like for example, the web interface and is not covered by this invention.<br>
4)	When there is an Incoming Call, when the user clicks on the Reject button the GUI pops up the option of redirecting the Call to a particular voice message on the NW PoC Box, showing the textual messages the voice messages represent.<br>
INCOMING CALL SCENARIO (an example)<br>
User John has not activated Session barring nor diverted his calls to his NW PoC Box. John is currently in a meeting and gets a PoC call from his friend on his Cell phone. John doesn't want to take the call but wants to inform his friend that he will call back in an hour or so. As he clicks on Reject call of his GUI, the PoC Client gives an option of diverting the Call to any of the pre-recorded Voice messages (as each voice message is associated with a textual description, the PoC Client, just shows a list of Text messages). John selects the appropriate message and the call is diverted to the NW PoC Box. The NW PoC Box plays the exact voice message which John wanted his friend to hear. John's friend hangs up without leaving a message.<br>
Additionally, after playing the voice message, which John has chosen, the NW PoC Box can also offer to take the voice message form the Caller, by playing the "Please leave a message after the beep"voice message.<br>
RE-DIRECTION TO A SPECIFIC PoC VOICE MESSAGE<br>
Redirecting to a particular personalized PoC voice message can be done by adding a new parameter to the contact header of the 302 redirection message in SIP. As each of the PoC voice message element in the PoC-voice-messages-info has a unique id associated with each PoC voice message, it can be used for the purpose.<br>
Below is an example of a redirection to a personalized PoC voice message by John, when his friend George calls him:<br>
SIP/2.0 302 Moved Temporarily<br>
Via: SIP/2.0/TCP 192.0.2.4:5060;branch=z9hG4bK-ik80k7g-1 Via: SIP/2.0/TCP 192.0.2.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bK-74bf9 From: George <george>;tag=9fxced76sl To: sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bcd6d3d4d2fcd9c4ddd1ccd0d992dfd3d1">[email&#160;protected]</a>;tag=09xde23d80 Call-ID: c3x842276298220188511 CSeq: 1 INVITE<br>

ald12dvbgd;&gt;<br>
Content-Length: 0<br>
Redirection message sent by John's PoC Client, indicating the PoC voice message to be played in the Contact header.<br>
Note:<br>
•	The poc_vm_id parameter in the Contact header of the 302 SIP response indicates to the NW PoC Box, the PoC voice message selected by John.<br>
•	This poc_vm_id parameter will be carried forward by the PoC server in the resulting INVITE (of the redirection) to the NW PoC Box, which is shown below (only the start line of the INVITE is shown).<br>
The INVITE from the PoC Server to John's NW PoC Box, upon redirection by John:<br>
INVITE sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b7ddd8dfd9c49ac7d8d4d5d8cff7d2cfd6dac7dbd299d4d8da">[email&#160;protected]</a>;cause=486;PoC_vm _id=ald12dvbgd SIP/2.0<br>
Controlling PoC Function procedures:<br>
The Controlling PoC Function which is hosting the PoC Session will insert a MIME SDP parameter to show it's intent to Grant the floor to the NW PoC Box, if the call is either redirected or forwarded to the NW PoC Box.<br>
On receiving a SIP 200 OK response for the INVITE sent to the NW PoC Box, if the NW PoC Box has also accepted the Offer to take the Floor on Session setup, the CF will allow the Floor to be granted to the NW PoC Box. The CF will send the Floor Grant message to the NW PoC Box and a Floor Taken Message to the Caller as mentioned in the Patent FLOOR NEGOTIATION TECHNIQUE FOR POC (1837/CHE/2007).<br>
NW PoC Box operation:<br>
The NW PoC Box will respond with an intent to be Granted the Floor when it accepts invitations which offer to Grant the Floor to the NW PoC Box. The NW PoC Box will do the following on receipt of such an offer:<br>
1.	Wait for the Floor Granted message from the Controlling PoC Function which offered to Grant the Floor to the NW PoC Box.<br>
2.	Retrieve the Voice message id from the Content header uri parameter.<br>
3.	Retrieve from the Media storage database the voice message and start streaming the voice message on receipt of the Floor Grant Message.<br>
4. Release the Floor on finishing the streaming of the Voice message.<br>
The procedure for offering the Floor to the NW PoC Box is explained in greater detail in the following patent: FLOOR NEGOTIATION TECHNIQUE FOR POC (1837/CHE/2007).<br>
METHODS FOR STORING VOICE MESSAGES IN A PoC BOX:<br>
Voice messages can be stored in the PoC Box by the PoC Box Owner:<br>
•	Using a Web interface.<br>
•	A SIP Call with the NW PoC Box.<br>
1) Using a Web interface: A service provider generally gives an administrative interface to all Subscribers, typically a username and a password to Login to a website, and set various preferences. Recording voice messages for storing voice messages on the PoC Box can be achieved through a Recording Java Applet (or any similar web client program). Alternatively, the user can record the voice message in a Recorder (A software program that can record voice in a particular format), and store the recorded voice in the file system. The Service provider could also give the option of uploading the recorded file directly to the web interface.<br>
For Example, a browse button to select a file from the File system, and upload it to the Web server from an HTML page, like making an email attachment.<br>
The Recording Java Applet could have an interface for recording the user's voice message and uploading it to the NW PoC Box. It can also offer a text box, for keying in a title for the recorded message.<br>
After the voice message has been recorded and a title has been set in the text box, the User interface will have a Submit voice message button, pressing which will upload the recorded voice message to the Web Server. When the user hits the Submit Voice Message button, an HTTP POST method is used to send the data to the web server. The Web server does further processing of the data as it may be required.<br>
• Web/Application Server Processing:<br>
The Web/Application Server contacted for storing the Voice message could be co- located with the PoC Box itself. Once a user uploads a Voice message from the browser, it can store it in the file system in the user's respective directory.<br>
Example- John could have a directory dedicated for his personal voice messages as follows (configured by the Service Provider):<br>
https://pocbox.pocnetwork.com/users/vmbox/john/<br>
The naming convention for the voice messages stored and their directory structure could be defined by local policy.<br>
After the Web server has successfully retrieved the voice message from the HTTP POST request, and stored it in the respective location designated for the user on the file system, it has to do a HTTP PUT to the PoC XDM document or the NW PoC Box document (wherever the XML Document is stored), to add the new Voice message element.<br>
The XCAP PUT Request message would be something like the below: PUT http://pocxdm.pocnetwork.com/	 HTTP/1.1<br>
Content-Length:...<br><poc-voice-message id="ald 12dvbgd"><br><url>http://pocbox.pocnetwork.com/users/john/vmbox/0004.wav <note>l will call you back when I'm free. </note></url></poc-voice-message><br>
XCAP conventions would be used for adding the PoC-voice-message element to the respective user's PoC-voice-messages-info document. The Web/Application Server can use any method for generating unique PoC_vm_id, bounded by the only constraint that it should be unique within a particular user's document.<br>
The Service provider could configure for each user a default voice message, when the initial PoC-voice-messages-info document is created in the PoC XDM or NW PoC Box. The message flow for the above method of storing a voice message in the NW PoC Box is shown in Figure 4.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	Easier to Store, Edit, Delete and Playback the stored voice messages through a web interface. 
2.	More flexible for editing the Title of an already recorded message.<br>
3.	Can record a voice message, even if the user does not have a PoC Client.<br>
4.	Downloaded announcements from other websites/local disk, can be easily uploaded to the personal PoC Box. <br>
2) A SIP Call to the NW PoC Box<br>
The Service provider can configure a PoC Box URI for each user, to store his personal Voice messages, or it can be the same Request URI for all users, with different Request URI parameters for different users.<br>
The PoC Client can learn this URI through Device configuration or some other process. A call to this SIP URI would play an announcement from the PoC Box, to store a new Voice message. The PoC Subscriber can also pass the title of the recorded voice message as Multipart in the Body of the INVITE or using a new SIP header for this purpose.<br>
• Web/Application Server Processing:<br>
Once the PoC Box has the Voice message recorded and stored, the Web/Application server (co-located) has to do similar functions as is done in the case of using a Web interface to upload voice messages, for adding the new XCAP element <poc-voice-message> to the PoC Voice messages Info XML document.<br>
Advantages<br>
An Internet browser is not required for uploading new voice messages. Setting the Default Voice Message<br>
The setting of the Default Voice message is achieved through 2 XCAP operations:<br>
The First operation would be to DELETE (XCAP Delete operation) the type="default" attribute from the currently existing PoC Voice Message element, and then the second operation would be an (XCAP PUT operation) setting the PoC Voice Message with type="default" attribute to the PoC Voice Message Element that has to be made the default voice message. Detailed explanation of XCAP operations can be found in RFC 4825 {"The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access protocol (XCAP)"}.<br>
Updating the PoC Voice Message info Document at the PoC Client<br>
On Login, the user generally retrieves the RLS, RL etc from the PoC XDM. Similarly the PoC Client will also retrieve the PoC Voice Message Info Document from the NW PoC Box or the PoC XDM (wherever it has been stored), and cache a local copy of it. The PoC Client will also SUBSCRIBE to the Document changes, so that it is notified of any changes to the Document, and is in sync with the document at the server, which can be modified through different interfaces at different times.<br>
Storing/Retrieving the voice messages from the user's Voice Mail Box using SIP<br>
There needs to be a way to indicate to the NW PoC Box/ Voice mail system on why the user is setting up a call between the User's Terminal and the NW PoC Box, it could be for any of the following reasons:<br>
1.	For storing new voice messages (to be played back to callers)<br>
2.	Playing back already stored voice messages.<br>
3.	For retrieving voice messages left by callers.<br>
The Service provider could have configured different URI's for each user for achieving the above mentioned cases, and this could have been learnt by the<br>
User's terminal during the Device configuration process. The SIP INVITE'S Request URI parameters could be used to make the NW PoC Box take different actions, depending on its value.<br>
For example:<br>
sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1d1cec2c3ced9e1d1cec2cfc4d5d6ced3ca8fc2cecc">[email&#160;protected]</a>;user="adam";purpose="store";<br>
The above example could be a Request URI used when a user Adam stores new messages into his PoC Box. Similarly the poc_vm_id could be used to playback a particular stored message.<br>
Example of a Voice message deletion operation:<br>
sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="40302f23222f3800302f232e2534372f322b6e232f2d">[email&#160;protected]</a>;user="adam";purpose="delete";poc_vm_id='s dcvxcz45gh"<br>
The below example shows the Request URI used when a user Adam deletes a particular voice message from his PoC Box.<br>
sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ccbca3afaea3b48cbca3afa2a9b8bba3bea7e2afa3a1">[email&#160;protected]</a>;user="adam";poc_vm_id="slkdjld39324123k3 klaldk";<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
