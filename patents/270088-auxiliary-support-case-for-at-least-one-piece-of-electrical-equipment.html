DESCRIPTION<br>
"AUXILIARY SUPPORT FRSME FOR AT LEAST ONE PIECE OF<br>
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT"<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
electrical systems for dwellings and offices, and more<br>
particularly, relates to a support frame for wall-<br>
mounting one or more pieces of electrical equipment.<br>
To the purposes of the present invention, by<br>
"electrical equipment" is generally meant any means or<br>
electrical device being generally a part of electrical<br>
installations in civil buildings and the like, and which<br>
is usually intended to be mounted, for example embedded,<br>
to walls of said buildings. Accordingly, this term<br>
includes, in a non-limiting manner, switches, power<br>
sockets, data outlets, TV sockets, phone sockets, push-<br>
buttons, switches, diverter switches, general control<br>
electrical devices, connectors, thermostats, timers, fuse<br>
carriers, bells/buszers, emergency lamps, such as<br>
removable ones, signalling lamps such as step lights,<br>
displays such as LCDs, and the like.<br>
Most of the above-mentioned electrical equipment is<br>
known to be usually wall-mounted using assembly kits,<br>
which generally include:<br>
-	a box intended to be embedded in the wall;<br>
-	an equipment mounting frame (for brevity, called<br><br>
2<br>
the "mounting frame" herein below) to be fixed to the box<br>
and comprising a frame body developing about a window<br>
that defines a mounting seat suitable to receive and hold<br>
one or more pieces of electrical equipment; and<br>
- a cover plate being removably fixable to the frame<br>
and provided with an opening to allow a user to gain<br>
access, either visually or manually, to the electrical<br>
equipment installed on the support frame.<br>
Prior art mounting frames are currently suitable to<br>
accommodate a piece of electrical equipment or a<br>
combination set of modular electrical equipment being<br>
placed side by side to each other. Particularly,<br>
conventional wall-mounted frames have the drawback of<br>
strongly limiting the number of configurations with which<br>
electrical equipment can be mounted. For example, several<br>
types of power sockets (the so-called SCHUKO) are<br>
available, the electrical plugs matching therewith having<br>
such a shape that, when they have been inserted in the<br>
respective sockets, they have portions overlapping, at<br>
least partially, the adjacent electrical equipment. This<br>
may prevent the user from being able to insert the<br>
corresponding plug in an adjacent socket, to easily press<br>
a switch or read a display that may also be mounted on<br>
the same frame.<br>
Accordingly, prior art frames have low flexibility<br><br>
3<br>
relative to the positioning of several types of<br>
electrical equipment being available on the market.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
mounting structure having a greater flexibility than that<br>
offered by prior art frames, in relation with the various<br>
positioning requirements of the electrical equipment to<br>
be accommodated within the mounting seat.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the support<br>
frame such as defined and characterized in claim 1.<br>
Preferred embodiments are as defined in the<br>
dependent claims 2-13.<br>
The object of the present invention is also a set of<br>
parts for wall-mounting electrical equipment such as<br>
defined in claim 14.<br>
The invention will be better understood from the<br>
following detailed description of an embodiment thereof,<br>
which is given by way of example with reference to the<br>
annexed figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a top perspective view of an exemplary<br>
support frame according to the invention;<br>
Pig. 2 is a top perspective view of an exemplary<br>
wall-mounted frame to be coupled to the mounting frame of<br>
Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a bottom perspective view of the wall-<br>
mounted frame of Fig. 2;<br><br>
3bis<br>
DE 198 35 837 A1 relates to an assembly kit for wall-<br>
mounting an electrical equipment having break-out<br>
openings, which respectively are provided with outline<br>
shapes, in which the electrical equipment are insertable<br>
vertically, or horizontally, in different using<br>
positions,<br><br>
4<br>
Fig. 4 is a top perspective view of the wall-mounted<br>
frame from Fig. 2 as shown together with three support<br>
frames, each being like that in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 5 is a bottom perspective view of the mounting<br>
structure of Fig. 4; and<br>
Fig. 6a and 6b show two different perspective views<br>
of a piece of electrical equipment to be mounted to the<br>
support frame according to the invention.<br>
In the figures, equal or similar elements will be<br>
designated with the same numerals.<br>
In Fig. 1, there is shown a top perspective view of<br>
an exemplary support frame 1 in accordance with the<br>
present invention to be used as an auxiliary frame to be<br>
associated with a wall-mounted frame 100 (shown in Fig. 2<br>
and 3).<br>
The support frame 1 consists of a frame body 2<br>
developing about a window 3 defining a mounting seat<br>
suitable to receive and hold at least one piece of<br>
electrical equipment.<br>
The window 3 is sized such as to be capable of<br>
accommodating one piece of electrical equipment or a<br>
combination of modular electrical equipment being placed<br>
side by side to each other. This can be achieved since<br>
conventional electrical equipment has a first dimension<br>
being substantially identical to a whole multiple of a<br><br>
5<br>
basic modular dimension and a second dimension being<br>
variable and equal thereto.<br>
In the example reported herein, the mounting seat 3<br>
is sized to accommodate a piece of electrical equipment<br>
of the so-called "two-module" type, i.e. having the<br>
second dimension twice as large as the basic modular<br>
dimension or two pieces of electrical equipment of the<br>
so-called "one-module" type, placed side by side. By one-<br>
module electrical equipment is meant a piece of<br>
electrical equipment having the second dimension equal to<br>
the basic modular dimension. An example of a one-module<br>
piece of electrical equipment is shown in Fig. 6a and 6b<br>
and is generally indicated with numeral 400.<br>
The body 2 of the support frame 1 is preferably made<br>
of insulating material and is substantially shaped like a<br>
frame with a substantially rectangular plan with rounded<br>
angles.<br>
The frame body 2 is defined by a first pair of<br>
counter-posed walls 4 and 5 and a second pair of counter-<br>
posed walls 6 and 7 having the ends joined to the walls<br>
of the first pair. The first pair of walls 4 and 5 is<br>
substantially orthogonal to the second pair of walls 6<br>
and 7. Each wall of the first and second pairs has an<br>
inner face and an outer face. In the figures, the outer<br>
faces of all the walls have the same numeral 8. The inner<br><br>
6<br>
faces of the counter-posed walls 4 and 5 of the first<br>
pair are designated with numeral 9 whereas the inner<br>
faces of the walls 6 and 7 of the second pair are<br>
designated with numeral 10.<br>
A fixing element 11 is associated with each of the<br>
outer faces 8, which is suitable to allow a coupling,<br>
preferably of the snap type, between the support frame 1<br>
and the wall-mounted frame 100. The fixing element 11 is,<br>
such as in the example described herein, in a central<br>
area of the respective face.<br>
The fixing element 11 comprises, for example, a pair<br>
of ribs 12 being substantially parallel to each other,<br>
which define a coupling channel 13 substantially<br>
perpendicular to each of the outer faces 8 and suitable<br>
to allow a matching fixing element to slide therein,<br>
which is provided on the mounting frame 100, until it<br>
reaches the snap-attachment position. Particularly, this<br>
complementary fixing element is a tab 200 projecting from<br>
the wall-mounted frame 100, such as shown in Fig. 2 and<br>
3.<br>
To facilitate the coupling between the support frame<br>
1 and the wall-mounted frame 100, a tooth 14 is developed<br>
orthogonal to the coupling channel 13, such that an<br>
accommodating region for the tab 200 is defined in the<br>
snap-attachment position.<br><br>
7<br>
The tooth 14 advantageously consists of an inclined<br>
plane 15 parallel to the pair of ribs 12 to facilitate<br>
the tab 200 sliding on said inclined plane and an<br>
abutment plane 16, which is perpendicular to the pair of<br>
ribs 12, to allow the tab 200 to stop.<br>
Advantageously, the abutment plane 16 is suitable to<br>
further prevent any relative movement of the support<br>
frame 1 with respect to the wall-mounted frame 100 in the<br>
direction parallel to the coupling channel 13, after it<br>
has reached the attachment position.<br>
At least one of the first 4, 5 and second 6, 7 pairs<br>
of counter-posed walls provides, on the inner faces 9,<br>
attachment means 17 to allow electrical equipment 400 to<br>
be mounted to the support frame 1.<br>
In the example in the figures, the attachment means<br>
17 are associated with the inner faces 9 of the pair of<br>
walls 4 and 5, whereas the inner faces 10 of the pair of<br>
walls 6 and 7 have no additional element associated<br>
therewith, but only have the function of joining the<br>
walls of the first pair.<br>
Particularly, the attachment means 17 are such as to<br>
cooperate with corresponding counter-shaped attachment<br>
elements being provided on opposite sides of the<br>
electrical equipment 400 to be attached to the support<br>
frame 1. Preferably, the fixing means 17 include seats 18<br><br>
8<br>
suitable to receive respective fixing tabs 500 of the<br>
electrical equipment 400.<br>
The wall-mounted frame 100 has a main body 101 that,<br>
in the example described herein, runs around three<br>
windows 300 that define respective seats, each being<br>
suitable to accommodate a support frame 1 such as<br>
described above. More generally, the body 101 can run<br>
around one or more windows.<br>
The body 101 of the mounting frame 100 is preferably<br>
made of sheet metal and is substantially shaped as a<br>
frame. Still more preferably, this body is<br>
approximatively shaped as a plate-like frame and<br>
preferably has a rectangular plan. Particularly, the body<br>
101 has a first dimension (length) and a second dimension<br>
(width) that are joined to each other with rounded<br>
angles, such as in the example from Fig. 3 and 4. Since<br>
three windows 300 placed side by side have to be<br>
included, each being capable of accommodating a support<br>
frame 1, the first dimension of the body 101 is about<br>
three times as large as the second dimension.<br>
Each of the windows 300 is defined by respective<br>
edges, respective tabs 200 being associated therewith. To<br>
ensure the coupling between the support frame 1 and the<br>
mounting frame 100, the position of the fixing elements<br>
12 on each of the outer faces 8 of the walls of the<br><br>
9<br>
support frame 1 is required to match the position of each<br>
of the tabs 200 relative to the edge of the respective<br>
window 300. In the example described herein, the fixing<br>
elements 12 are in the center of the respective walls,<br>
thus, such as shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the tabs 200 are<br>
formed in the center of the corresponding edge.<br>
This allows the support frame 1 to be snap-attached<br>
to the body 101 such that the pair of counter-posed walls<br>
4 and 5, on the inner faces of which there are provided<br>
the attaching means 17 to receive the electrical<br>
equipment, are parallel, or alternatively, perpendicular<br>
to the lower dimension of the mounting frame 100.<br>
The first position, pair of walls 4 and 5 parallel<br>
to the lower dimension of the mounting frame 100,<br>
corresponds to a first possible orientation of electrical<br>
equipment (a two-module piece of electrical equipment, or<br>
two different one-module pieces of electrical equipment<br>
placed side by side) such that the latter have their<br>
greater dimension parallel to the greater dimension of<br>
the mounting frame 100.<br>
The second position, pair of walls 4 and 5<br>
orthogonal to the lower dimension of the mounting frame<br>
100, corresponds to a second possible orientation of<br>
electrical equipment in which the latter have the greater<br>
dimension orthogonal to the greater dimension of the<br><br>
10<br>
support frame 100.<br>
When the wall-mounted frame 100 is fixed such as to<br>
have, for example, the greater dimension orthogonal to<br>
the floor ground of a building, the electrical equipment,<br>
in the frame of the first orientation, is parallel to the<br>
floor and thus installed in a horizontal manner. On the<br>
other hand, in the frame of the second orientation, the<br>
electrical equipment is vertical to the floor and can be<br>
said to be vertically installed.<br>
In Fig. 4 and 5, the support frames 1 are all fixed<br>
to the mounting frame 100 according to the same<br>
orientation, i.e. such that the pair of walls 4 and 5 is<br>
parallel to the greater dimension of the support frame.<br>
It should be understood that each support frame 1<br>
can be attached on a same wall-mounted frame 100<br>
according to one of the first orientation and the second<br>
orientation regardless of the orientation of the other<br>
support frames.<br>
A plurality of possible combinations is available<br>
between the first and second orientations of each of the<br>
support frames 1, and they increase as the number of<br>
frames that can be accommodated within the wall-mounted<br>
frame 100 increases, and obviously depend on the<br>
installer's requirements and the type of electrical<br>
equipment being used.<br><br>
11<br>
As may be seen in Fig. 2-5, the wall-mounted frame<br>
100 includes wall-fixing means being, for example,<br>
through holes, preferably slotted, which are suitable to<br>
receive respective screws to fix the mounting frame 100,<br>
for example, to a box embedded in the wall.<br>
The body 101 further comprises coupling means for<br>
cover plate, not shown in the figures, to be associated<br>
to the mounting frame 100. These coupling means are, for<br>
example, channels or seats for coupling with respective<br>
fixing tabs provided in the cover plate.<br>
The function of this plate, as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art, is both to ensure a minimum<br>
protection to the electrical equipment, and prevent any<br>
access to the electrically conductive parts of the<br>
electrical equipment. Another major task assigned to the<br>
cover plates is to mask flaws due to a cavity being<br>
present in the wall and an optional further box.<br>
As may be seen, the object of the invention is fully<br>
achieved since the auxiliary frame described herein can<br>
be associated to the wall-mounted frame in two different<br>
positions, which correspond to two different orientations<br>
of the electrical equipment to be attached to said frame.<br>
This allows having that flexible orientation for the<br>
pieces of electrical equipment to be placed side by side<br>
on the same frame such as to meet the installer's or<br><br>
12<br>
user's requirements.<br>
Furthermore, the solution provided herein has the<br>
advantage that each support frame 1 can be easily mounted<br>
to the respective wall-mounted frame 100, particularly<br>
due to the use of the snap fitting. In fact, the snap<br>
fitting allows the operations required for mounting the<br>
electrical equipment to be facilitated and accelerated.<br>
Still more advantageously, due to the fact that each<br>
support frame is removable from the wall-mounted frame,<br>
the installer or user can easily modify the orientation<br>
of the electrical equipment, such that power plugs having<br>
particular shapes can be accommodated, displays can be<br>
visualized or switches can be made accessible.<br><br>
