				<td>Novel Process for the preparation of Pitavastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of Pitavastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, preferably Pitavastatin calcium which is chemically known as (3R, 5S)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl) quinolin-3-yl]-3, 5-dihydroxy-6(E)-heptenoic acid calcium salt having the following formula (I)<br><br>
Formula I Wherein M is H, Na+,K+,Mg+2,Ca+2.<br>
Pitavastatin is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent that acts as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitor). This enzyme catalyzes the conversions of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, inhibitors are commonly referred to as “statins”. Statins are therapeutically effective drugs used for reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentration in the blood stream of patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. Pitavastatin is used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type IIa and IIb).<br>
The compound of the present invention inhibits the HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a main role in the synthesis of cholesterol, and subsequently they suppress the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Therefore, they are useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia,<br>
hyperlipoproteinemia, and atherosclerosis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
US Patent 5856336 claimed quinoline type mevalonolactones, specifically Pitavastatin. The disclosed process using an expensive reagent like sodium hydride, n-butyl lithium and borane derivates, reagents that are difficult to use on a commercial scale.<br><br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for a novel process for the preparation of quinoline<br>
derivatives such as Pitavastatin that reduces the problems of the prior art on a commercial<br>
scale in a convenient and cost efficient manner.<br>
US  2005/0124639 claim the process for the preparation of Rosuvastatin and its<br>
intermediates using Wittig reagent.<br>
EP 0521471  Patent describes a process for the synthesis of the calcium salt of<br>
Rosuvastatin, the final stage of which is the conversion of the sodium salt of the<br>
Rosuvastatin into the calcium salt. The calcium salt thus formed is then collected and<br>
dried and may be processed further as required.<br>
This conversion of the sodium salt into the calcium salt, followed by collection and<br>
drying is also described in an international patent application WO 00/49014.<br>
