				<td>Hydrophilic, Thiol-Reactive Cylnine Dyes and Conjugates Thereof with Biomolecules<br>
for Fluorescence Diagnosis<br>
This invention relates to new fluorescence dyes from the class of cyanine dyes, especially indotricarbocyanines with an absorption and fluorescence maximum in the spectral range of 700 to 900 nm, a thiol-specific reactive group and three, preferably four, sulfonate groups, to an increase in water solubility as well as the production of dyes. This invention also relates to the conjugates of these dyes with biomolecules and uses thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of light in medical diagnosis has recently gained importance (see, e.g., Biomedical Photonics Handbook (Editor: T. Vo-Dinh), CRC Press). A wide variety of diagnostic processes are found in the experimental test for application in various medical disciplines, e.g., endoscopy, mammography, surgery or gynecology. Light-based processes have a high instrumental sensitivity and make possible molecular detection and imaging of the smallest quantities of chromophores and/or fluorophores (Weissleder et al. (2001) Molecular Imaging, Radiology 219, 316-333).<br>
Dyes that are fed to the tissue as exogenic contrast media for fluorescence diagnosis and imaging, and here in particular fluorescence dyes with an absorption and fluorescence maximum in the spectral range of 700-900 nm (diagnostic window of tissue), are of special interest for in-vivo use. Photons of this wavelength are comparatively little absorbed by tissue and can therefore penetrate several centimeters into the tissue before the absorption process (primarily by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) ends the light transport. Absorption can take place, moreover, by the fluorescence dyes that are introduced into the tissue, but that emit the absorbed energy in the form of longer-wave fluorescence radiation. This fluorescence radiation can be detected spectrally separated and makes possible the localization of dyes and the correlation with molecular structures to which the dye has bonded (see in this connection also Licha, K. (2002) Contrast Agents for Optical Imaging (Review). In: Topics in Current Chem-<br><br>
In: Topics in Current Chemistry - Contrast Agents II (Editor: W. Krause), Volume 222, Springer Heidelberg, pp. 1 - 31 .)â€¢<br>
To achieve a diagnostically significant differentiation between diseased structures and healthy tissue, the dye that is fed must lead to as high a concentration difference between the tissues as possible. This can be carried out based on tumor-physiological properties (blood supply, distribution kinetics, delayed removal). For molecular labeling of disease-specific structures, conjugates that consist of fluorescence dyes with target-affme biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, and antibodies, can be used. After injection, a certain portion of these conjugates binds to molecular target structures, such as receptors or matrix proteins, while the unbonded portion is excreted from the body. In this way, a higher concentration difference and thus a greater image contrast in implementing the fluorescence diagnosis result.<br>
Fluorescence dyes from the class of cyanine dyes fall into the category of promising representatives and were synthesized in many different structural widths. In particular, carbocyanines with indocarbocyanine, indodicarbocyanine and indotricarbocyanine skeletons have high extinction coefficients and good fluorescence quantum yields [Licha, K. (2002) Contrast Agents for Optical Imaging (Review). In: Topics in Current Chemistry - Contrast Agents II (Editor: W. Krause), Volume 222, Springer Heidelberg, pp. 1-31, and the references cited therein].<br>
WO 96/17628 thus describes an in-vivo diagnostic process by means of near-infrared radiation. In this case, water-soluble dyes and biomolecule adducts thereof with specific photo-physical, and pharmacochemical properties are as contrast media for fluorescence and transil-lumination diagnosis.<br>
The synthesis of cyanine dyes with indocarbocyanine, indodicarbocyanine and indotricarbocyanine skeletons is well described in the prior art. Relevant literature in this respect is, for example: Bioconjugate Chem. 4, 105-111, 1993; Bioconjugate Chem. 7, 356-62, 1996; Bio-conjugate Chem. 8, 751-56, 1997; Cytometry 10, 11-19, 1989 and 11, 418-30, 1990; J. Het-erocycl. Chem. 33, 1871-6, 1996; J. Org. Chem. 60, 2391-5, 1995; Dyes and Pigments 17, 19-27, 1991, Dyes and Pigments 21, 227-34, 1993; J. Fluoresc. 3, 153-155, 1993; and Anal. Bio-chem. 217, 197-204, 1994. Additional processes are described in patent publications US<br><br>
ublications US 4,981,977; US 5,688,966; US 5,808,044; WO 97/42976; WO 97/42978; /O 98/22146; WO 98/26077; and EP 0 800 831.<br>
Moreover, indotricarbocyanines with altered substituents were synthesized and coupled to biomolecules (described in, i.a., Photochem. Photobiol. 72, 234, 2000; Bioconjugate Chem. 12, 44, 2001; Nature Biotechnol. 19, 237, 2001; J. Biomed. Optics 6, 122, 2001; J. Med. Chem. 45, 2003, 2002). Other examples are found in particular in the publications WO 00/61194 ("Short-Chain Peptide Dye Conjugates as Contrast Agents for Optical Diagnostics"), WO 00/71162, WO 01/52746, WO 01/52743 and WO 01/62156.<br>
The known indotricarbocyanines previously used in the prior art still have drawbacks, however, that impair their efficient use.<br>
Low fluorescence quantum yields of the indotricarbocyanines always exist after a coupling to biomolecules. For the commercially available dye Cy7, Gruber et al. (Bioconjugate Chemn. 11, 696-704, 2000) thus describe that a loss of fluorescence efficiency occurs after coupling to a biomolecule. Becker et al. (Photochem. Photobiol. 72, 234, 2000) describe conjugates of an indotricarbocyanine with HSA and transferrin with fluorescence quantum yields of 2.9% or 2.8% and deformed absorption spectra in physiological medium.<br>
In addition, the dye conjugates tend toward aggregation. Becker et al. (Photochem. Photobiol. 72, 234, 2000) for conjugates of an indotricarbocyanine with HSA and transferrin and Licha et al. (Bioconjugate Chem. 12, 44-50, 2001) for receptor-binding peptides describe them as having deformed absorption spectra in physiological medium. These deformations indicate aggregate formation and the fluorescence extinction that occurs as a result. A similar problem exists in the case of an inadequate water solubility of the dyes.<br>
With a reactive group, there is also always inefficient access to derivatives. Gruber et al. (Bioconjugate Chem. 11, 696-704, 2000) thus describe the use of Cy7-bifunctional NHS-esters with two reactive groups, which could potentially produce cross-linking of two biomolecules. By two carboxy groups in the molecule, however, the synthetic access to derivatives is hampered with only one reactive group and leads to by-products (e.g., contains mono-reactive NHS esters of Cy7 portions of the non-activated and the double-activated Cy7 molecule).<br><br>
There is thus a continuous need for cyanine dyes that are efficient and easy to produce for the fluorescence diagnosis that reduce or do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks. In addition, these dyes should be well suited for the production of conjugates with biomolecules.<br>
A first object of the invention is achieved by the preparation of an indotricarbocyanine dye of general formula (I),<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 which<br>
X is O, S or C that is substituted in two places, whereby the substituents can be selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and/or butyl; Y is CHb-CHb or CH2-CH2-CH2; Z is C\ to â‚¬5 alkyl, whereby the C atoms are optionally substituted by O or S, or<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
to Rt, independently of one another, are SOsH or H, with the proviso that at least three of Ri to R4 are SO3H, R5 is -CO-NH-R8-R9, -NH-CS-NH-Rg-R9 or -NH-CO-Rg-R9, in which R8 is selected from the group that consists of unbranched C2-Ci3 alkyl, in which C atoms are optionally replaced by O or S, and R9 is selected from<br>
chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl, iodoacetyl, chloroacetamido, iodoacetamido, chloroalkyl, bro-moalkyl, iodoalkyl, pyridyl disulfide and vinyl sulfonamide, and in which R$ and Rj are CH or are connected by a Cs-alkyl to a hexyl ring, which optionally can be substituted in para-position with a Ci to C4-alkyl radical, and salts and solvates of this compound.<br>
Preferred is an indotricarbocyanine dye of this invention, in which Y is CFk-Cf^; Z is Ci to â‚¬5 alkyl, whereby the C atoms are optionally substituted by O or S, and in which Re and R? are CH, and salts and solvates of this compound.<br>
More preferred is an indotricarbocyanine dye of this invention, in which Z is Cj-Cs alkyl. Even more preferred is an indotricarbocyanine dye of this invention, in which Zis<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
and Re and R7 are connected to a hexyl ring via Cs-alkyl.<br>
Fluorescence dyes from the class of cyanine dyes, in particular indotricarbocyanines with an absorption and fluorescence maximum in the spectral range of 700 to 900 nm, of a thiol-specific reactive group and three, preferably four, sulfonate groups, are thus subjects of this invention. The latter are used to increase water solubility.<br>
It could now be found, surprisingly enough, that the indotricarbocyanines according to the invention with the above-mentioned structure (compact position of 3-4 sulfonate groups with sulfonatoethyl radicals) have a high fluorescence quantum yield of &gt; 15% and that the fluorescence quantum yield after coupling to biomolecules remains approximately unchanged (maximum loss of about 10%). The absorption spectra of the conjugates show, moreover, no deformation of the dye absorption in the NIR range at about 750 nm. Good hydrophilia, reduced aggregation and increased fluorescence quantum yield relative to conventional indotri-<br>
indotricarbocyanines or Cy7 derivatives with less than three sulfonate groups, especially in ^the case of Cy7 and other known structures, are thus produced.<br>
Another essential aspect in the preparation of the cyanine dyes for fluorescence diagnosis according to the invention relates to those derivatives that have reactive functional groups to make possible a covalent coupling to target-specific biomolecules. Suitable derivatives are, e.g., NHS esters and isothiocyanates (Bioconjugate Chem. 4, 105-111, 1993; Bioconjugate Chem. 8, 751-56, 1997), which react with amino groups, such as, for example, maleimides, alpha-haloketones or alpha-haloacetamides (Bioconjugate Chem. 13, 387-391, 2002; Bioconjugate Chem. 11, 161-166, 2000), which react with thiol groups. Other bifunctional linkers can originate from the group that comprises arylenediisothiocyanate, alkylenediisothiocy-anate, bis-N-hydroxy-succinimidylesters, hexamethylenediisocyanate and N-(y-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide ester.<br>
WO 01/77229 describes cyanine dyes with a combination of sulfoaryl groups, alkyl substitu-ents in weso-position of the methine chain and at least one reactive group that makes possible the binding to biomolecules. The embodiments relate to indodicarbocyanines (polymethine chain that consists of 5 C atoms), however, and the compounds have no reactive group in meso-position.<br>
WO 00/16810 ("Near-Infrared Fluorescent Contrast Agent and Fluorescence Imaging") describes indotricarbocyanines, i.a., with substituents in the meso-position of the C7-polymethine chain. It is not indicated, however, how reactive groups can be introduced or produced.<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to an indotricarbocyanine dye, in which RS is COOH orNH2.<br>
The published derivatives are based primarily on the Cy3-, Cy5-, Cy5.5- and Cy7-basic structure (commercially available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; US 5,268,486; Cy3 = indo-carbocyanine, Cy5=indodicarbocyanine, Cy7=mdotricarbocyanine). Thiol group-reactive derivatives are of special interest, since the latter allow a directed conjugation with biotechno-logical cysteines that are positioned specifically in biomolecules. The prior art is concentrated here primarily on Cy3 and Cy5 derivatives.<br>
^Especially preferred indotricarbocyanine dyes according to the invention are selected from the dyes with formulas (II) to (XX) that are listed in Table 1 below:<br>
Table 1: Preferred Dyes According to the Invention(Figure Remove)<br><br>
aspect of this invention relates to a process for the production of an indotricarbocya-nine dye of this invention. In this case, a simple access via 4-substituted pyridines was found. Surprisingly enough, various 4-substituted pyridines in high yields could be converted by means of the Zincke reaction (Zincke-Konig reaction, see Ro'mpps Chemie Lexikon [Rompps Chemical Dictionary], 10th Edition, page 5067) in /we-so-substituted glutaconaldehyde-dianilide (precursors to cyanine dye).<br>
In addition to the simple and efficient synthesis of 4-substituted pyridines, the symmetrical structure of the dyes of this invention opens up the possibility of a defined derivatization with a thiol-group-selective reactive group in symmetrical meso-position of the molecule.<br>
The further derivatization to thiol group-reactive compounds was thus carried out. Thiol group-reactive functionalities are, e.g., maleinimide (maleimide), chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl, iodoacetyl, chloroacetamido, bromoacetamido, iodoacetamido, chloroalkyl, bromoalkyl, io-doalkyl, pyridyl disulfide and vinyl sulfonamide.<br>
Still another aspect of this invention relates to a process for the production of a conjugate that comprises coupling an indotricarbocyanine dye of this invention to a biomolecule. Within the scope of this invention, "biomolecule" is to be defined as any molecule of biological origin that has a biological activity, in particular enzymatic activity or binding of substances of synthetic or biological origin, such as, for example, pharmaceutical agents, peptides, proteins, receptors or nucleic acids. In turn, preferred biomolecules are proteins, such as, for example, enzymes, peptides, antibodies and antibody fragments (such as, e.g., single chain, Fab, F(ab)2, diabodies, etc.), lipoproteins, nucleic acids, such as, for example, oligonucleotides or polynu-cleotides from DNA or RNA, aptamers, PNA, and sugars, such as, for example, mono-, di-, tri-, oligo- and polysaccharides.<br>
The synthesis and biological characterization of cyanine dye conjugates with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies and fragments thereof and proteins for in-vivo fluorescence diagnosis of tumors, is described in the prior art in various publications. In this case, primarily the above-mentioned Cy3, Cy5, Cy5.5 and Cy7 were used (see in this respect, i.a., Nature Bio-technol. 15, 1271, 1997; Cancer Detect. Prev. 22, 251, 1998; J. Immunol. Meth. 231, 239, 1999; Nature Biotechnol. 17, 375,1999; Nature Medicine 7, 743,2001).<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to a conjugate of an indotricarbocyanine dye according to the invention with a biomolecule that was produced according to a process of the invention. This conjugate can be characterized in that it comprises a biomolecule as defined above, whereby as a biomolecule, at least one biomolecule, selected from peptides, proteins, lipoproteins, antibodies or antibody fragments, nucleic acids, such as, for example, oligonucleotides or polynucleotides of DNA or RNA, aptamers, PNA, and sugars, such as, for example, mono-, di-, tri-, oligo- and polysaccharides, is more preferred. The coupled protein can thus be characterized in that it is selected from the group of skeletal proteins or soluble proteins of the body. Quite especially preferred are serum proteins (e.g., HSA), antibodies/antibody fragments, such as, e.g., an scFv-fragment or F(ab), as well as peptides, BSA, egg albumin or a peroxidase derived therefrom.<br>
Thus known from the prior art are, e.g., antibodies that are directed against molecules that are expressed intensively in the angiogenetically active tissue and only to a very low level in the adjoining tissue (see WO 96/01653). Of special interest are antibodies that are against the receptors for vascular growth factors, receptors with endothelial cells to which inflammation mediators bind, and matrix proteins that are expressed specifically in the formation of new vessels. Preferred are other antibodies or antibody fragments that are directed against the matrix protein EDB-fibronectin and conjugates therefrom according to the invention. EDB-fibronectin, also known as oncofetal fibronectin, is a splice variant of the fibronectin, which is formed specifically around newly formed vessels in the process of angiogenesis. Especially preferred are antibodies LI9, E8, AP38 and AP39 against the EDB-fibronectin (Cancer Res 1999, 59, 347; J Immunol Meth 1999,231,239; Protein Expr Purif 2001,21,156).<br>
Preferred is a conjugate according to the invention that is characterized in that the indotricar-bocyanine dye is coupled to the biomolecule via an SH group, especially via an SH group to a cysteine. Optionally even more preferably produced therefrom are those antibodies and their fragments that are produced by recombinant techniques, such that on the C-terminus or the N-terminus (within the outside 1-10 amino acids), they contain a cysteine that does not form any intramolecular S-S-bridges and therefore can be used for coupling to the dyes according to the invention.<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to a diagnostic kit that comprises an indotricarbocya-nine dye of this invention and/or a conjugate of this invention. In addition, the kit can contain additional adjuvants for implementing an in-vivo diagnosis of, in particular , tumors. These adjuvants are, for example, suitable buffers, vessels, detection reagents or directions for use. The kit preferably contains all materials for an intravenous administration of the dyes according to the invention. Special embodiments of such kits according to the invention are, for example, as follows.<br>
A first vessel that contains the antibody (biomolecule) with a free SH group and standard buffers/additives either as a solution or freeze-dried material. Another vessel that contains the dyes according to the invention as solution (common additives) or freeze-dried material in a molar ratio of 0.1 to 1 (lOx deficit in an equimolar quantity). The dye-containing vessel is<br>
optionally mixed with buffer or distilled water and added to the biomolecule-containing vessel, incubated for 1-10 minutes and used directly as an injection solution.<br>
In another embodiment, the kit is present in a two-chamber system (e.g., a syringe), which in one chamber contains the antibody solution, and physically separated by a breachable wall in a second chamber contains the dye as solution or solid material. After the wall is broken, a mixture and production of the injection solution is carried out.<br>
A last aspect of this invention then relates to the use of a conjugate according to the invention as a fluorescence contrast medium for in~vivo diagnosis of tumors. The absorption maximum of Cy7 in this connection is in the range of 745 nm and is thus especially suitable for the in-vivo detection of fluorescence from deeper tissue layers (see above). Cy7 derivatives with thiol group-selective reactive groups are not yet described, however. In addition, the use of antibody conjugates for detection of the edge areas of tumors is already described in WO 01/23005 (Antibody Dye Conjugates for Binding to Target Structures of Angiogenesis in Order to Intraoperatively Depict Tumor Peripheries), but not with use of advantageous dyes according to the invention.<br>
The invention is now to be further described in terms of the following examples and figures without, however, being limited thereto.<br>
Figure 1 shows the standardized absorption and fluorescence spectrum of conjugate Kll (A) and K15 (B) (see Table 2) in PBS, and<br>
Figure 2 shows the results of the imaging properties of the conjugates according to the invention of Example 24 with: substance: conjugate K15; tumor: F9 teratocarcinoma in the right rear flank of the mouse; dose: 50 nmol/kg of body weight (data relative to the dye); excitation: 740 nm (diode laser); detection: CCD-camera (Hamamatsu) with a 802.5 Â± 5 nm bandpass filter and the times: before injection, and 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours after injection. The position of the tumor is identified by arrows.<br>
