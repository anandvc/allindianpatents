AN ELECTRICAL DEVICE WITH FIXED CONTACTS, MOBILE CONTACTS AND<br>
INSPECTABLE ARC CHAMBERS DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a low-voltage electrical device provided with fixed contacts, mobile contacts and arc chambers that can be inspected.<br>
Low-voltage electrical devices, such as for example switches circuit-breakers and disconnectors, are, as is known, devices used generally in electrical systems the operating voltage of which generally reaches up to 1000 V. It is likewise known that for correct functioning of such devices it is necessary to envisage and carry out periodic interventions of inspection and maintenance.<br>
The interventions of inspection envisage checking of the state and functionality of the components in order to choose the type of intervention of maintenance to carry out. The maintenance interventions can be divided principally into ones of a conservative type and ones of a replacement type. In interventions of a conservative type, operations are carried out that substantially involve adjustment, calibration and setting, cleaning and regeneration of one or more components constituting the device in order to restore them to optimal operating conditions. In interventions of a replacement type, instead, replacement is made of one or more components that, following upon operation of the device, have undergone alterations such as to jeopardize their functionality irreversibly.<br>
The configuration of current electrical devices is far from conducive to either of the types of maintenance just referred to. The components making up the devices are in fact connected to one another according to a well-defined sequence of assembly. This aspect entails that the possible regeneration and/or replacement of one of the components assembled at the start of the sequence imposes as a consequence dismantling and subsequent re-assembly of a large number of the components.<br>
Low-voltage circuit-breakers, for example, comprise, as is known, one or more seats in which one or more fixed contacts are housed that are to be connected to corresponding mobile contacts in the proximity of an arc chamber. An appropriate kinematic chain enables movement of the mobile contacts.<br>
Traditionally, the fixed contacts are inserted and positioned within the respective seats before the mobile contacts and before the components of the kinematic chain. It is therefore understandable how, in the current state of the art, possible operations of maintenance carried out on the fixed contacts, for example of a replacement nature, impose<br><br>
the need to dismantle numerous functional parts of the devices such as, for example, mobile contacts, kinematic chains and arc chambers.<br>
Some solutions present on the market are conducive to operations of inspection, i.e. checking of the conditions of the circuit-breakers. In some cases, for example, removable grills are used, located on the outer surface of the devices in the proximity of the arc chamber or arc chambers. Removal of these grills enables, in the best of cases, removal of the arc chambers, but does not facilitate or in any case is not effectively conducive to possible maintenance interventions. In particular, there remain prevented interventions of a replacement type on the fixed contacts. The very operations of inspection and conservative maintenance can be carried out only in a partial and approximate way, on account of the limited space and angle of access to the fixed and/or mobile contacts.<br>
From what has been said, there is evidently the need to have available electrical devices for low-voltage applications, the conception of which is more effectively conducive to the interventions of inspection and/or maintenance of one or more parts constituting the device itself.<br>
Consequently, the primary task of what forms the subject of the present invention is to provide an electrical device for low-voltage applications that will enable the drawbacks referred to above to be overcome.<br>
In the framework of this task a purpose of the present invention is to provide an electrical device the structure of which will facilitate the operations of inspection of the fixed contacts, mobile contacts and corresponding arc chambers.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to provide an electrical device the structure of which will facilitate the operations of maintenance of the fixed contacts, mobile contacts and corresponding arc chambers.<br>
Not the least important purpose of what forms the subject of the present invention is to provide an electrical device that will present a high degree of reliability and will be relatively easy to produce at competitive costs.<br>
The above tasks, as well as the above and other related purposes that will appear more clearly from what follows, are achieved by an electrical device according to what is specified in Claim 1.<br>
One of the main advantages of the invention lies in the possibility of removing the fixed contacts from their normal operative position in order to enable inspection and maintenance thereof, as well as possible similar interventions on the mobile contacts or on the<br><br>
arc chambers. The presence of a removable module on which the fixed contacts are housed does not entail dismantling of other components constituting the electrical device, unlike the case of solutions currently available on the market.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge more clearly from the description of preferred, but non-exclusive, embodiments of the electrical device according to the invention, illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the annexed plate of drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a first possible embodiment of an electrical device according to the invention, specifically a triple-pole single-break circuit-breaker;<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded view of the electrical device appearing in Figure 1;<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are, respectively, a first perspective view and a second perspective view of a possible embodiment of an at least partially separable module according to the invention;<br>
Figure 5 is an exploded view of a second embodiment of an electrical device according to the invention, specifically a triple-pole single-break circuit-breaker;<br>
Figure 6 is a second exploded view of the electrical device appearing in Figure 5;<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view of a third embodiment of a second electrical device according to the invention, specifically a triple-pole double-break disconnector;<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view of a fourth embodiment of the electrical device according to the invention, specifically a triple-pole double-break circuit-breaker with translating mobile contacts; and<br>
Figure 9 is a perspective view of a fifth embodiment of the electrical device according to the invention, specifically a triple-pole double-break circuit-breaker with rotating mobile contacts.<br>
In the course of the description reference will be made in particular to electrical device 1 used as a triple-pole single-break circuit-breaker (see Figures 1 to 6). The technical solutions and the considerations that will be presented may in any case extend also to other electrical devices (see, for example, Figures 7 to 9) which are normally used in the context of low-voltage systems and comprise fixed contacts.<br>
With reference to the attached figures, the electrical device 1 according to the invention comprises at least one fixed contact designed to connect to a corresponding mobile contact in the proximity of an area of breaking, according to modalities and embodiments amply known in the art and hence not illustrated in detail.<br><br>
The electrical device 1 according to the invention is characterised in that it comprises a module 30 on which the fixed contact is housed. The module 30 is operatively connected to a structural part 5 of the device 1 in such a way that the corresponding fixed contact assumes an operative position in which it connects up to the respective mobile contact. The module 30 has a shaped body, at least in part made of an insulating material comprising one or more seats, in each of which a fixed contact is mounted. The module 30 is moreover at least partially separable from the structural part 5 of the device 1 in order to enable the operations of inspection and maintenance of the fixed contact and/or of the corresponding mobile contact to be carried out.<br>
On the basis of what has been said so far, the module 30 thus assumes a first position in which it is stably connected to the structural part 5 of the device 1 and a second position in which it is totally or partially separated from the same structural part 5. This second position enables a user to carry out conveniently the operations of maintenance on the fixed contacts or on the module itself. In this second position the module 30 is prearranged, for example, for the subsequent possible dismantling of the fixed contacts or else for replacement or regeneration of the parts of the module itself in order to restore optimal conditions of electrical insulation following upon, for example, natural degradation due to the presence of sublimated material.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are, respectively, a first, perspective, view and a second, exploded, view corresponding to a first embodiment of the electrical device 1 according to the invention. The device 1 comprises a plurality of arc chambers 400a, 400b, 400c, in each of which at least one mobile contact 20a, 20b, 20c is connected to at least one fixed contact 10a, 10b, 10c (see Figure 3). In particular, the module 30 is connected to said structural part 5 so as to position itself in an area corresponding to said arc chambers 400a, 400b, 400c.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one, but preferably each, of the arc chambers 400a, 400b, 400c is constituted by a cavity 40a, 40b, 40c and comprises a plurality of arc-breaker elements 41, which are, for example, connected to one another and are designed to favour extinction of the electric arc that is formed during separation of the contacts.<br>
As is evident from Figure 2, once the partially separable module 30 is connected to the structural part 5, it constitutes a wall delimiting the cavities 40a, 40c, 40c, and its possible removal basically opens an advantageous "window" that enables the user to carry out inspection and/or maintenance of each arc chamber 40 and of the possible arc-breaker elements 41 present therein. In particular, the latter can to advantage be extracted from the<br><br>
corresponding cavities 40a, 40b, 40c and subsequently re-inserted at the end of the operations of inspection and/or maintenance.<br>
Once again with reference to Figure 2, during normal operation of the device 1, the separable module 30 is operatively connected to the structural part 5 through connection means such as, for example, tightening screws or bolts. Said connection means have the function of contrasting the thrust deriving from the impact of the mobile contacts 20a, 20b, 20c on the respective fixed contacts 10a, 10b, 10c following upon closing of the contacts.<br>
In the solution in Figure 2, the connection means are constituted by tightening screws 60 located at a height of the separable module 30 in the proximity of which the cited thrust of impact is generated. Of course, the solution just described constitutes only one example of the innumerable forms of connection and sealing that can be used for the same purpose.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate an embodiment of the at least partially separable module 30. In particular the module comprises also one or more electrodes 50a, 50b, 50c, each of which is operatively connected to one of said fixed contacts 10a, 10b, 10c. The module 30 illustrated is moreover preferably made of insulating material; alternatively, at least the surface of the module 30 up against the fixed contacts must present insulating characteristics.<br>
From the structural standpoint, the module 30 comprises a first ribbing 68 and a second ribbing 69 designed to combine with a first recess 78 and a second recess 79 made in the structural part 5 of the device 1. The cited ribbings 68 and 69 and recesses 78 and 79 have as their main function that of favouring the union of the module 30 to the structural part 5 through their substantially complementary shape, which to advantage guides the connection of the parts. The joinable parts so far indicated can in any case be variously shaped and made indifferently on the module 30 and on the structural wall 5 according to a principle of complementarity.<br>
With reference once again to Figure 2, the solution illustrated envisages that the module 30 is removed completely from the structural part 5 so as to be separated therefrom. Of course, this is to be considered exclusively as a possible embodiment in so far as falling within the inventive idea are possible alternative solutions in which the module 30 remains partially constrained to the structural part 5, for example, via the use of hinges, assuming basically a function similar to that of a door.<br>
In the solutions so far illustrated, the module 30 substantially takes the form of a single body shaped in such a way as to house a plurality of fixed contacts.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 regard a second embodiment of the invention, in which the use of a<br><br>
plurality of at least partially separable modules 30a, 30b, 30c is envisaged, each of which designed to house at least one of the fixed contacts 10a, 10b, 10c of the electrical device 1. Each of these modules 30a, 30b, 30c is individually connected to the structural part 5 of the device 1 in an area corresponding to an arc chamber, as may be noted clearly from Figure 6. Basically, associated to each partially separable module are corresponding connection means, for example, like the ones already referred to above. This technical solution enables a user to inspect, and possibly intervene on, a single fixed contact, a single arc chamber or else a single module.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, the device 1 comprises, in particular, at least one first partially separable module 30a, which is mutually constrained to a second module 30b adjacent thereto. In particular, the first module 30a comprises, along a first side 35 thereof, a recess 32a designed to house a key 31a emerging from a second side 36 of the second partially separable module 30b. The latter comprises moreover a second recess 32b designed to receive a second key 31b emerging from a third partially separable module 30c adjacent to said second module 30b. Basically, in the solution illustrated, each of said partially separable modules is not only connected to the structural part 5 but also constrained to at least one of the modules adjacent thereto. This latter technical solution enables an increase in the structural rigidity of the connection, distributing the mechanical stresses in a more uniform way.<br>
As already mentioned above, the circuit-breaker illustrated in the figures so far referred to is of the single-break type, but it remains understood that the present invention can conveniently be applied also to single-pole or multipole double-break devices of the translating-mobile contact type or else rotating-mobile contact type. In this connection, Figure 7 regards a double-break disconnector 2 having translating mobile contacts. In addition to a first set of fixed contacts, as in the previous solutions, the disconnector 2 comprises also a second set of contacts that are located in positions symmetrical to the first with respect to a transverse axis of the disconnector. The disconnector 2 comprises a pair of at least partially separable modules such that a first module 30d comprises the first set of fixed contacts, whilst a second module 30e houses the second set of fixed contacts.<br>
Of course, falling within the scope of the inventive idea is the possibility of making a single removable module comprising both of the sets of contacts, as well as the possibility of making a number of modules each comprising one or more fixed contacts.<br>
Figure 8 regards, instead, a triple-pole double-break circuit-breaker 3 with translating<br><br>
mobile contacts and is distinguishable from the solution illustrated in Figure 7 on account of the presence of a bottom containment module 80 designed to house, for example, current sensors and/or protection relays. The circuit-breaker 3 in question also comprises a set of connection elements 70, only the ends of which are visible in Figure 8. Of said ends, the top ones connect to the fixed contacts, for example via the illustrated bolts 75, whilst the bottom ones constitute the bottom electrodes of the circuit-breaker.<br>
Figure 9 regards a double-break circuit-breaker with rotating mobile contacts 4. In this solution, there may be noted the presence of a rear module 30f (illustrated in exploded view) and of a front module 30g, which are connected to the structural part 5 of the device 4 in an area corresponding, respectively, to a rear surface 101 and a front surface 102. In particular, in the solution illustrated, the rear module 3 Of is connected to the structural part 5 at a lower height with respect to the front module 30g.<br>
The technical solutions adopted for the electrical device enable the pre-set tasks and purposes to be fully achieved. In particular, through the use of one or more at least partially separable modules, the operations of inspection and maintenance of the fixed contacts and/or of the arc chambers are considerably simplified to the advantage of a reduction in the overall times and costs.<br>
In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent dimensions and shapes, may be any whatsoever according to the requirements and the state of the art.<br><br><br><br>
