The following abbreviations are used in the examples:<br><br><br>
RR =	number of moles of 4-chloro-4'thiomethvldiphenvlether formed. %<br>
Number of moles of 4-chloro-4'aminodiphenylether introduced<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
2.20 g (10 mmoles) of 4-chloro-4'-aminodiphenylether, 8 ml of water and, with stirring, 2.33 g (23 mmoles) of 36% hydrochloric acid were charged into a 50 ml double envelope reactor.<br>
It was heated to 90°C and the mixture became homogeneous.<br>
This temperature was maintained for 45 minutes then it was cooled to 10°C.<br>
0.69 g (10 mmoles) of an aqueous 30% sodium nitrite solution was poured in over two hours using a syringe driver.<br>
The diazonium salt was added dropwise to a mixture of 0.82 g of dimethyldisulphide and 5 ml of water and 31 mg of copper metal in a 100 ml reactor at 50°C.<br>
15 ml of isopropyl ether was added.<br>
The reactor was emptied and the organic phase was washed with 100 ml of water and 100 ml of 10% sodium bisulphite in water and again with 100 ml of water.<br>
The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure of 2 mbars, at 50°C for 1 hour.<br>
1.38 g of 4-chloro-4'-thiomethyldiphenylether was obtained, corresponding to a degree of transformation of 100^ and a yield RR of 55%,.       '<br>
The product obtained could be purified by crystallisation from methanol.<br>
EXAMPLES 2 TO 14<br>
The above example was repeated, changing the nature of the catalyst.<br>
The quantity of product formed was determined by gas chromatographic analysis.<br>
The results are shown in Table (I).<br><br><br>
165 g of Cl-Ph-0-Ph-NH2 (0.75 moles) was charged into a 2.0 litre three-necked flask provided with a thermometer, a dropping funnel, a coolant surmounted by an argon reservoir (balloon) and maintained under an inert atmosphere with vigorous magnetic stirring. 300 ml of acetic acid was then added.<br>
The assembly was heated to 80°C then 82.5 g of a concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (37%) was slowly added.<br>
The reaction medium was stirred for about 45 min at 80°C.<br>
The temperature was allowed to return to 65°C with stirring.<br>
2.13 g of CuCh was then added to the reaction medium, followed by 132 ml of Me2S2.<br>
Then an aqueous NaNOi solution (solution of 54 g in 120 ml of H2O) was added using the dropping funnel.<br>
When no more gas had been released, the temperature was returned to ambient temperature and the reaction medium was diluted with 360 ml of water. Two phases appeared.<br>
500 ml of methylcyclohexane was added and the two phases were separated.<br><br>
The aqueous phase was extracted again with methylcyclohexane (500 ml).<br>
After evaporating off the methylcyclohexane, 242 g of a brown oil was recovered. The crude product was recrystallised to produce 124 g of pink-white crystals (yield: 66%; purity: 97.2%, determined by gas chromatography; and MPt = 56.0°C).<br>
A second recrystallisation was possible.<br><br><br><br>
