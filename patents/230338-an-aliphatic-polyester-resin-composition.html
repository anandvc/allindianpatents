				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an aliphatic<br>
polyester resin composition, a preparation method<br>
therefor, and a molded article and a foamed article<br>
produced from the resin composition. Particularly, the<br>
invention relates to an aliphatic polyester resin<br>
composition which comprises a crosslinked biodegradable<br>
polyester resin with its terminal carboxyl groups at<br>
least partly blocked and is excellent in heat resistance,<br>
moldability and hydrolysis resistance, and to a<br>
preparation method for the resin composition and a molded<br>
article and a foamed article produced from the resin<br>
composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polylactic acids are more excellent'in heat<br>
resistance with higher glass transition temperatures<br>
(Tg) than other biodegradable resins, but the heat<br>
resistance of the polylactic acids in a temperature range<br>
higher than Tg is no: necessarily high. Since the<br>
polylactic acids have lower crystallization rates, the<br>
molding cycle for injection molding should be increased.<br>
Further, the polylac.ic acids have lower melt<br>
viscosities, so that molding conditions are<br>
significantly limited. Therefore, the molding<br>
productivity is relatively low.<br>
For improvement of the heat resistance and the<br>
productivity, the inventors of the present invention<br>
previously proposed , and JP-2003-128901 and<br>
JP-A-2003-238789 tha;; a biodegradable polyester is<br><br>
crosslinked by addition of a (meth)acrylate compound or<br>
a polyvalent isocyanate compound. Further, the<br>
inventors proposed in JP-A-2003-147182 that a layered<br>
silicate is additionally used.<br>
On the other hard, JP-A-2001-261797 discloses a<br>
technique for improving the heat resistance and the<br>
hydrolysis resistance by blocking terminal carboxyl<br>
groups of a polylactic acid by a specific carbodiimide<br>
compound.<br>
The heat resistance and moldability of the<br>
polylactic acids are improved by the crosslinking and<br>
the addition of the layered silicate. However, the<br>
polylactic acids fail to maintain their physical<br>
properties due to hydrolysis during prolonged storage<br>
or during use under severely humid and hot conditions.<br>
Therefore, the practicality of the polylactic acids is<br>
not sufficient under such conditions.<br>
Further, the polylactic acid with its terminal<br>
groups blocked by the carbodiimide compound as disclosed<br>
in JP-A-2001-261797 is not suitable for production of<br>
injection molded articles, foamed articles and<br>
blow-molded articles.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the aforesaid problems, it is an object<br>
of the present invention to provide an aliphatic<br>
polyester resin composition excellent in heat resistance,<br>
moldability and hydrolysis resistance, a preparation<br>
method therefor, and a molded article produced from the<br>
resin composition.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found<br>
that the aforesaid problems are solved only by utilizing<br>
the crosslinking and the terminal group blocking of a<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANING DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph illustrating a relationship<br>
between crystallinity (Î¸) and time (minute) for<br>
determining a crystallization rate index according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
The biodegradable polyester resin (A) to be used<br>
in the present invention essentially comprises an a-<br>
and/or p-hydroxycarboxylic acid unit. Examples of the<br>
a- and/or p-hydroxycarboxylic acid unit include L-lactic<br>
acid, D-lactic acid, glycolic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric<br>
acid, 3-hydroxyvaler ic; acid, and 3-hydroxycaproic acid,<br>
among which L-lacticacid, D-lactic acid or a mixture<br>
of L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid is preferred for<br>
industrial mass production.<br>
Therefore, the biodegradable polyester resin (A)<br>
to be used in the present invention is po1y (L- and/or<br>
D-lactic acid), poly ( glycolie acid),<br>
poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid), poly(3-hydroxyvaleric<br>
acid) or poly (3-hydroxycaproic acid) , or a copolymer or<br>
a blend of any of these polymers.<br>
In consideration of the mechanical strength and<br>
heat resistance of an article molded from the inventive<br>
aliphatic polyester resin composition, the a- and/or<br>
P-hydroxycarboxylic acid unit is preferably present in<br>
a proportion of not smaller than 50 mol%, more preferably<br>
not smaller than 60 mol%, most preferably not smaller<br>
than 7 5 moll, in the biodegradable polyester resin (A) .<br>
The biodegradable polyester resin (A) preferably has a<br>
melting point of not lower than 120Â°C, more preferably<br>
not lower than 150Â°C. The melting point can be<br>
4<br><br>
controlled by properly selecting the type and amount of<br>
the hydroxycarboxylic acid unit.<br>
The biodegradable polyester resin (A) is prepared<br>
by a known melt polymerization method, as required, in<br>
combination with a solid state polymerization method.<br>
Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) and poly(3-hydroxyvaleric<br>
acid) may be microbiologically prepared.<br>
As required, another biodegradable resin component<br>
may be copolymerized or blended with the poly(a- and/or<br>
P-hydroxycarboxylic acid) as the major component of the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin (A), as long as the heat<br>
resistance of the poly(a- and/or p-hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acid) is not deteriorated. Examples of the<br>
biodegradable resin component include aliphatic<br>
polyesters such as polyethylene succinate and<br>
polybutylene succinate which are prepared from a diol<br>
and a dicarboxylic acid, poly (Ï-hydroxyalkanoates) such<br>
as poly(e-caprolactone), poly(butylene<br>
succinate-co-butylene terephthalate) and poly(butylene<br>
adipate-co-butylene terephthalate) which are<br>
biodegradable even with aromatic components, polyester<br>
amides, polyester carbonates, and polysaccharides such<br>
as starch. A non-biodegradable resin component may be<br>
copolymerized or blended with the poly(Î±- and/or<br>
P-hydroxycarboxylic acid) without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The molecular weight of the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin is not particularly limited, but the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin preferably has a weight<br>
average molecular weight of not smaller than 50,000 and<br>
not greater than 1,00C,000, more preferably not smaller<br>
than 80,000 and not greater than 1,000,000. If the<br>
weight average molecular weight is smaller than 50,000,<br>
the melt viscosity of the resin composition is too low.<br>
On the other hand, if the weight average molecular weight<br>
is greater than 1,000,000, the moldability of the resin<br><br><br>
composition is reduced.<br>
The crosslinking agent (B) to be used for<br>
crosslinking the biodegradable polyester resin (A)<br>
comprises at least one crosslinking agent selected from<br>
the group consisting of (meth)acrylate compounds and<br>
polyvalent isocyanate compounds. The (meth)acrylate<br>
compounds and the polyvalent isocyanate compounds may<br>
be used in combination.<br>
Preferred examples of the (meth)acrylate compounds<br>
include a compound which conta.ins two or more (meth) acryl<br>
groups in its molecule and a compound which contains one<br>
or more (meth)acryl groups and one or more glycidyl<br>
groups or vinyl groups in its molecule. These compounds<br>
are highly reactive with the; biodegradable polyester<br>
resin (A), and provide a resin composition less liable<br>
to contain residual monomers and less liable to be<br>
colored. Specific examples of the (meth)acrylate<br>
compounds include glycidyl methacrylate, glycidyl<br>
acrylate, glycerol dimsthacrylate, trimethylolpropane<br>
trimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate,<br>
allyloxypolyethylene glycol monoacrylate,<br>
allyloxypolyethylene glycol rr.onomethacrylate, ethylene<br>
glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate,<br>
polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, polypropylene glycol diacrylate and<br>
polytetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate (whose<br>
alkylene glycol moiety may contain copolymerized<br>
alkylenes having various molecular lengths), butandiol<br>
methacrylate and butandiol acrylate, among which<br>
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate and<br>
polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate are preferred for<br>
the safety and the reactivity.<br>
Preferred examples of the polyvalent isocyanate<br>
compounds include compounds which are highly reactive<br><br><br>
with the biodegradable polyester resin (A) and provide<br>
a resin composition less liable to contain residual<br>
monomers. Specific examples of the polyvalent<br>
isocyanate compounds include hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, naphthylene<br>
diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, polyesters<br>
modified with polyvalent isocyanates,<br>
poly (meth) acrylic acici compounds modified with<br>
polyvalent isocyanates and compounds obtained by<br>
modifying polyvalent alcohols with polyvalent<br>
isocyanates, and mixtures of any of these compounds,<br>
among which hexamethylene diisocyanate and tolylene<br>
diisocyanate are preferred for the safety and the<br>
reactivity.<br>
The aforesaid crosslinking agent (B) is preferably<br>
blended in the biodegradable polyester resin (A) in a<br>
total amount of 0. 01 to L0 parts by mass, more preferably<br>
O.01 to 5 parts by mass, further more preferably 0.01<br>
to 1 part by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin (A) . If the amount of the<br>
crosslinking agent is smaller than 0.01 part by mass,<br>
the heat resistance and the moldability intended by the<br>
present invention cannot be provided. If the amount of<br>
the crosslinking agent is greater than 10 parts by mass,<br>
the crosslinking degree is too high, so that the<br>
operability is reduced.<br>
Where the polyvalent isocyanate compound is used<br>
as the crosslinking ager.t (B) , a blend amount of greater<br>
than 5 parts by mass ma^ result in deterioration of the<br>
operability and the safety because an unreacted portion<br>
of the isocyanate compound is liable to evaporate.<br>
Further, reheating reduces the molecular weight of the<br>
resulting resin composition. Therefore, the blend<br>
amount is preferably not greater than 5 parts by mass<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of the biodegradable polyester<br><br><br>
resin (A).<br>
A method for the crosslinking by the crosslinking<br>
agent (B) is not particularly limited, but the simplest<br>
method is such that the biodegradable polyester resin<br>
(A) is melt-mixed with the crosslinking agent (B).<br>
Where the biodegradable polyester resin (A) is<br>
melt-mixed with the crosslinking agent (B), a peroxide<br>
is preferably added as a crosslinking assist agent for<br>
increasing the crosslinking degree. Preferred<br>
examples of the peroxide include organic peroxides which<br>
are excellent in d i s p e r s i b i1i t y in the resin. Specific<br>
examples of the organic peroxides include benzoyl<br>
peroxide, bis (butylperoxy)trimethylcyclohexane,<br>
bis(butylperoxy)methylcyclododecane, butyl<br>
bis(butylperoxy)valerate, dicumyl peroxide, butyl<br>
peroxybenzoa t e , dibutyl peroxide,<br>
bis(butylperoxy)diisopropylbenzene,<br>
dimethyldi(butylperoyy)hexane,<br>
dimethyldi(butylperoxy)hexyne and butylperoxycumene.<br>
The peroxide is preferably blended in the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A) i:i an amount of 0.1 to 10 parts by<br>
mass, more preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by mass, based on<br>
100 parts by mass of the biodegradable polyester resin<br>
(A). If the blend amount is smaller than 0.1 part by<br>
mass, the effect of increasing the crosslinking degree<br>
is reduced. A blend amount of greater than 10 parts by<br>
mass is not preferred in terms of costs.<br>
In the inventive aliphatic polyester resin, some<br>
or all of carboxyl groups of the biodegradable polyester<br>
resin (A) should be blocked by the terminal blocking<br>
agent (C). A terminal blocking degree is not<br>
particularly limited, but may be properly adjusted<br>
depending on the application of the resin. However, the<br>
ratio of the blocked terminal carboxyl groups of the<br>
resin (A) is preferably not lower than 20%, more<br>
preferably not lower than 50%, most preferably not lower<br><br><br>
than 90%, with respect to the terminal carboxyl groups<br>
of the resin (A) before the terminal blocking.<br>
A method for blocking the terminal carboxyl groups<br>
of the biodegradable polyester resin (A) is to add a<br>
proper amount of a terminal blocking agent of a<br>
condensation type such as a.n aliphatic alcohol or an<br>
amide compound into a polymerization system in the<br>
polymerization of the resir. and cause a<br>
dehydration-condensation reaction at a reduced pressure<br>
For easy control of the polymerization degree of the<br>
resin, however, it is preferred to add a terminal<br>
blocking agent of an addition type upon completion of<br>
the polymerization or when the polymerized resin is<br>
melted again.<br>
The terminal blocking agent of the addition type<br>
preferably comprises at least one compound selected from<br>
the group consisting of carbodiimide compounds, epoxy<br>
compounds, oxazoline compounds, oxazine compounds and<br>
aziridine compounds.<br>
Specific examples of the carbodiimide compounds<br>
include N,N'-di-2,6-diisopropylphenylcarbodiimide,<br>

either alone or in combination. In the present<br>

particular N,N'-di-2, b-diisopropylphenylcarbodiimide,<br>
or a polymer of any of these compounds (having a<br>
polymerization degree of about 2 to about 20) is<br>

Further other examples of the oxazine compounds include<br>
polyoxazine compounds containing any of the aforesaid<br>
compounds as a monomer unit. One or two or more<br>
compounds may be arbitrarily selected from the aforesaid<br>
oxazine compounds for blocking the terminal carboxyl<br>
groups of the biodegradable polyester resin (A) such as<br>
polylactic acid.<br>
Specific examples of the aziridine compounds<br>
include compounds obtained by addition reaction of a<br>
mono-, bis- or poly-iiocyanate compound and<br>
ethyleneimine.<br>
The terminal blocking agent (C) should be blended<br>
in the biodegradable polyester resin (A) in an amount<br>
of 0.01 to 20 parts by mass, preferably 0.05 to 10 parts<br>
by mass, more preferably 0.5 to 8 parts by mass, based<br>
on 100 parts by mass of the biodegradable polyester resin<br>
(A). If the blend amount is smaller than 0.01 part by<br>
mass, the hydrolysis resistance intended by the present<br>
invention cannot be provided. On the other hand, a blend<br><br><br>
amount of greater than 20 parts by mass is neither<br>
effective nor preferable in terms of costs.<br>
The inventive aliphatic polyester resin<br>
composition is prepared by melt-mixing the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A) , the crosslinking agent (B) and the<br>
terminal blocking agent: (C) by means of a common extruder<br>
such as a uniaxial extruder or a biaxial extruder, a roll<br>
kneader, a Brabender kreader or the like. At this time,<br>
it is also effective to use a static mixer or a dynamic<br>
mixer in combination vith the extruder. In order to<br>
facilitate the kneadirg, it is preferred to use the<br>
biaxial extruder.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to add<br>
the terminal blocking agent (C) to the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A), knead the resulting mixture, then<br>
add the crosslinking acent (E) to the mixture and knead<br>
the mixture. By blending the terminal blocking agent<br>
(C) and the crosslinking agent (B) in this order, the<br>
resin composition is effectively imparted with the<br>
hydrolysis resistance. Therefore, it is preferred to<br>
employ, for example, a mathod such that the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A) and the terminal blocking agent (C)<br>
are supplied into a main supply port of the extruder and<br>
then the crosslinking agent (B) is added from a middle<br>
portion of the extruder or a method such that the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin (A) is supplied into a main<br>
supply port of the extruder, then the terminal blocking<br>
agent (C) is added fron a first feed port provided at<br>
the middle of the extruder (a feed port closest to the<br>
main supply port) and the crosslinking agent (B) is added<br>
from a second or subsequent feed port. Alternatively,<br>
the biodegradable polyester resin (A) preliminarily<br>
terminal-blocked and the crosslinking agent (B) may be<br>
supplied together into the extruder, and kneaded.<br>
When the ingredients are supplied into the extruder,<br>
the ingredients may be dry-blended, and a known transport<br><br><br>
means such as a powder feeder or a pressure pump may be<br>
used .<br>
The layered silicate (D) may be blended in the<br>
inventive aliphatic polyester resin composition for<br>
further improvement of the moldability of the resin.<br>
The layered silicate may be a natural silicate or a<br>
synthetic silicate. Exemplary preparation methods for<br>
the synthetic silicate; are a melt method, an<br>
intercalation method and a hydrothermal method, and the<br>
silicate may be synthesized by any of these methods.<br>
Preferred examples of the layered silicate include<br>
smectites, vermiculites and swelled fluorinated mica.<br>
Examples of the smectites include montmorillonite,<br>
beidellite, hectorite and saponite. Examples of the<br>
swelled fluorinated mica include Na-type silicon<br>
tetrafluoride mica, Na-type taeniolite and Li-type<br>
taeniolite. Among these layered silicates,<br>
montmorillonite and Na-type silicon tetrafluoride mica<br>
are preferred. A cation exchange capacity is preferably<br>
25 to 200meq/100g.<br>
The layered silicate (D) is preferably blended in<br>
the biodegradable polyester resin (A) in an amount of<br>
O.05 to 30 parts by mass , more preferably 0.1 to 15 parts<br>
bymass, further more preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by mass,<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of the biodegradable polyester<br>
resin (A). If the blend amount is smaller than 0.05<br>
parts by mass, improvement of the heat resistance and<br>
the moldability cannot be expected. On the other hand,<br>
if the blend amount is greater than 30 parts by mass,<br>
it is difficult to finely disperse the layered silicate<br>
in the resin, and the resulting resin is liable to have<br>
a reduced toughness.<br>
It is preferred to preliminarily treat the layered<br>
silicate (D) with organic cations. Examples of the<br>
organic cations include protonized primary to tertiary<br>
amines, quaternary ammoniums and organic phosphoniums.<br><br><br>
Examples of the primary amines include octylamine,<br>
dodecylamine and octadecylamine. Examples of the<br>
secondary amines inc.ude dioctylamine,<br>
methyloctadecylamine and dioctadecylamine. Examples<br>
of the tertiary amines include dimethyloctylamine,<br>
dimethyldecylamine, oimetbyllaurylamine,<br>
dime thy lmyri st ylamine: , dimethylpalmitylamine,<br>
dimethylstearylamine, dilaurylmonomethylamine,<br>
tributylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, trioctylamine,<br>
dimethyldodecylamine and didodecylmonomethylamine.<br>
Examples of the quaternary ammoniums include<br>
tetraethylammonium, trimethyloctadecylammonium,<br>
dimethyldioctadecylammonium,<br>
dihydroxyethylmethyloctadecylammonium,<br>
methyldodecylbis(polyethylene glycol)ammonium and<br>
methyldiethy1(polypropylene glycol)ammonium.<br>
Examples of the organic phosphoniums include<br>
tetraethylphosphonium, tetrabutylphosphonium,<br>
tetrakis(hydroxymethyi)phosphonium and<br>
2-hydroxyethyltriphenylphosphonium. These cations<br>
may be used either alcne or in combination.<br>
A method for treating the layered silicate with the<br>
organic cations is to disperse the layered silicate in<br>
water or an alcohol and add a salt of the organic cations<br>
to the resulting dispersion with stirring to exchange<br>
inorganic ions of the layered silicate with the organic<br>
cations, followed by filtering, washing and drying of<br>
the resulting product.<br>
Where the layered silicate (D) is used in the<br>
present invention, an alkylene oxide or a compound having<br>
a hydroxycarboxylic ac:.d unit may be added as a<br>
dispersion improving agent to the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A) for improvement of the<br>
dispersibility of the layered silicate (D) in the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin (A) . Such a compound has<br>
affinity for both the biodegradable polyester resin and<br><br><br>
the layered silicate, and is easily intercalated between<br>
layers of the layerec. silicate to improve the<br>
dispersibility of the layered silicate in the resin.<br>
Examples of the alkylene oxide include polyethylene<br>
glycol and polypropylene glycol. Examples of the<br>
compound having a hydroxycarboxylic acid unit include<br>
polylactic acid, polyhydroxybutyric acid and<br>
poly(s-caprolactone). The compound having a<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid unit may be a compound with its<br>
terminal carboxyl groups replaced with hydroxyl groups<br>
(e.g., polycaprolactoadiol). The compound to be used<br>
as the dispersion improving agent preferably has a number<br>
average molecular weight of 200 to 50,000, more<br>
preferably 500 to 20,000. If the molecular weight is<br>
smaller than 200, a gas will emanate during the molding<br>
or bleed-out from the resulting molded article will occur<br>
If the molecular weight is higher than 50,000, the<br>
intercalation of the compound between the layers of the<br>
layered silicate will be insufficient.<br>
The dispersion improving agent is preferably<br>
blended in the biodegradable polyester resin (A) in an<br>
amount of 0.01 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably 0.02<br>
to 10 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin (A) . If the blend amount<br>
is smaller than 0.01 part by mass, the effect of the<br>
addition of the dispersion improving agent will be small.<br>
If the blend amount is greater than 20 parts by mass,<br>
the mechanical strengti and the heat resistance of the<br>
resin will be reduced. Exemplary methods for blending<br>
the dispersion improving agent include a method such that<br>
the layered silicate (D) is preliminarily impregnated<br>
with the dispersion improving agent, a method such that<br>
the dispersion improving agent is mixed with the layered<br>
silicate (D) in the presence of water or an organic<br>
solvent and then the water or the organic solvent is<br>
removed by filtering or the like, a method such that the<br><br><br>
dispersion improving agent is added when the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin and the layered silicate<br>
are melt - kneaded, and a method such that the dispersion<br>
improving agent is added together with the layered<br>
silicate when the biodegradable polyester resin is<br>
synthesized. Among these methods, the method of<br>
preliminarily mixing the dispersion improving agent with<br>
the layered silicate is preferred.<br>
A pigment, a heat, stabilizer, an antioxidant, a<br>
weather resistant agent , a flame retarder, a plasticizer,<br>
a lubricant, a mold release agent, an antistatic agent,<br>
a filler or the like nay be added to the inventive<br>
aliphatic polyester resin ccmposition, as long as the<br>
properties of the aliphatic polyester resin composition<br>
are not significantly deteriorated. Examples of the<br>
heat stabilizer and the antioxidant include hindered<br>
phenols, phosphorus conpounds, hindered amines, sulfur<br>
compounds, copper compounds and halides of alkali metals,<br>
and mixtures of any of these compounds. The heat<br>
stabilizer, the antioxidant, the weather resistant agent<br>
or a like additive is generally added during the melt<br>
kneading or the polymerization. Exemplary inorganic<br>
fillers include talc, cailcium carbonate, zinc carbonate,<br>
wollastonite, silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, calcium<br>
silicate, sodium alumiiate, calcium aluminate, sodium<br>
aluminosilicate, magnesium silicate, glass balloon,<br>
carbon black, zinc oxide, antimony trioxide, zeolites,<br>
hydrotalcite, metal fibers, metal whiskers, ceramic<br>
whiskers, potassium titanate, boron nitride, graphite,<br>
glass fibers and carbon fibers. Exemplary organic<br>
fillers include naturally existing polymers such as<br>
starch, cellulose particles, wood powder, bean curd<br>
refuse, chaff, wheat bran and kenaf, and products<br>
obtained by modifying :hese polymers.<br>
A method for mixing another thermoplastic resin<br>
and/or the filler with the inventive aliphatic polyester<br><br><br>
resin composition is not particularly limited. For<br>
example, the aliphatic polyester resin, the<br>
thermoplastic resin and/or the filler are kneaded by<br>
means of a uniaxial extruder, a biaxial extruder, a roll<br>
kneader, a Brabender kneader or the like after heating<br>
and melting. It is also effective to use a static mixer<br>
or a dynamic mixer in combination with the aforesaid<br>
extruder.<br>
Various articles can be molded from the inventive<br>
aliphatic polyester resin composition by a known molding<br>
method. At least one molding method selected from an<br>
injection molding method, a blow molding method, an<br>
extrusion molding method and a foam molding method is<br>
preferably used.<br>
An ordinary injection molding method as well as a<br>
gas injection molding method, an injection press molding<br>
method and an expansior injection molding method may be<br>
employed as the injection molding method. A cylinder<br>
temperature for the injection molding should be not lower<br>
than the melting point I'm or the fluidizing temperature<br>
of the resin, preferably 18 0 to 230Â°C, more preferably<br>
190 to 220Â°C. If the molding temperature is too low,<br>
short molding will occur to result in unstable molding,<br>
and overload is liable to occur. On the other hand, if<br>
the molding temperature is too high, the aliphatic<br>
polyester resin will be decomposed and, therefore, the<br>
resulting molded articLe will have a reduced strength<br>
or be colored. The temperature of a mold should be not<br>
higher than Tm-20Â°C. Where the crystallization of the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin in the mold is to be<br>
promoted for increasing the heat resistance of the<br>
biodegradable polyester resin, the mold temperature is<br>
preferably kept at a temperature of Tg+20Â°C to Tm-20Â°C<br>
for a predetermined period and then cooled to not higher<br>
than Tg. Where the crystallization of the resin in the<br>
mold is not reguired, the mold temperature may be<br><br><br>
immediately cooled to not higher than Tg. Where<br>
post-crystallization is required, heat treatment is<br>
preferably performed at a temperature of Tg to Tm-20Â°C.<br>
Exemplary blow molding methods to be employed for<br>
producing a blow-molded article from the inventive<br>
aliphatic polyester resin composition include a direct<br>
blow molding method in which the article is molded<br>
directly from material chips, an injection blow molding<br>
method in which a preform (bottomed parison) prepared<br>
by injection molding is blow-molded, and a draw blow<br>
molding method. Further, a hot parison method in which<br>
a preform is blow-molded immediately after preparation<br>
of the preform, or a cold parison method in which a<br>
preform is once cooled and taken out and then reheated<br>
to be blow-molded may be employed. A temperature for<br>
the blow molding shou...d be Tg+20Â°C to Tm-20Â°C. If the<br>
blow molding temperature is lower than Tg+20Â°C, the<br>
molding will be difficult, and the resulting blow-molded<br>
container will have an insufficient heat resistance. On<br>
the other hand, if the blow molding temperature is higher<br>
than Tm-20Â°C, the resulting blow-molded container is<br>
liable to have an uneven wall thickness, and draw-down<br>
will occur due to reduction of viscosity.<br>
The extrusion molding method to be employed for<br>
producing an extrusion-molded article from the inventive<br>
aliphatic polyester resin composition will be described.<br>
A T-die method or a round die method may be employed as<br>
the extrusion molding method. A temperature for the<br>
extrusion molding should be not lower than the melting<br>
point Tm or the fluidizing temperature of the aliphatic<br>
polyester resin composition, preferably 180 to 230Â°C,<br>
more preferably 190 to 220Â°C. If the molding<br>
temperature is too low, unstable molding will result,<br>
and overload is liable to occur. On the other hand, if<br>
the molding temperature is too high, the biodegradable<br>
polyester resin (A) will be decomposed and, therefore,<br><br><br>
the resulting extrusion-molded article will have a<br>
reduced strength or be colored. Sheets, pipes and the<br>
like are produced by the extrusion molding. For<br>
improvement of the heat resistance of these articles,<br>
a heat treatment may be performed at a temperature not<br>
lower than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the<br>
aliphatic polyester resin composition and not higher<br>
than Tm-20Â°C.<br>
The sheets thus produced may be deep-drawn, for<br>
example, by vacuum forming, air pressure forming or<br>
vacuum air pressure forming. Temperatures for the deep<br>
drawing and the heat treatment are preferably from<br>
Tg + 20Â°C to Tm-20Â°C. If the deep drawing temperature is<br>
lower than Tg+20Â°C, the deep drawing will be difficult,<br>
and the resulting container is liable to have an<br>
insufficient heat resistance. On the other hand, if the<br>
deep drawing temperature is higher than Tm-20Â°C, the<br>
resulting container is liable to have an uneven wall<br>
thickness and a poorer impact resistance with its<br>
orientation lost.<br>
Any common foaming methods may be employed for<br>
producing a foamed article from the inventive aliphatic<br>
polyester resin composition. By means of an extruder,<br>
for example, a foaming agent decomposable at the melting<br>
point of the resin is preliminarily blended with the<br>
resin and the resulting mixture is extruded from a<br>
slit-like nozzle into a sheet or from a round nozzle into<br>
a strand. Examples of the decomposable foaming agent<br>
include azo compounds such as azodicarbonamides and<br>
barium azodicarboxylates, ni~roso compounds such as<br>
N,N'-dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, hydrazine<br>
compounds such as 4 , 4 ' -oxybis (benzene sulfonyl<br>
hydrazide) and hydrazicarbonamide, and inorganic<br>
foaming agents such as sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
Alternatively, a volatile foaming agent may be injected<br>
from a middle portion cf the extruder for foaming the<br><br><br>
resin. Examples of such a foaming agent include<br>
inorganic substances such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide<br>
and water, and organic solvents typified by hydrocarbons<br>
such as methane, ethane, butane and pentane, fluorinated<br>
compounds and alcohols such as ethanol and methanol.<br>
Further, foamed particles may be produced by preparing<br>
particles of the resin composition, preliminarily<br>
impregnating the resin particles with the organic<br>
solvent, water or a like foaming agent, and changing the<br>
temperature and/or the pressure to foam the resin<br>
particles.<br>
By employing any of the aforesaid molding methods,<br>
various molded articles can be produced from the<br>
inventive aliphatic polyester resin composition.<br>
Specific examples of the molded articles include<br>
tableware such as dishes, bowls, pots, chopsticks,<br>
spoons, forks and knives, containers for fluids,<br>
container caps, rulers,, stationery such as writing<br>
utensils, clear cases and CD cases, daily commodities<br>
such as sink corner strainers, trash boxes, washbowls,<br>

Example s<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be<br>
described further specifically by way of examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention be<br>
not limited to the following examples.<br>
The following measurement methods were employed<br>
for evaluation of Examples; and Comparative Examples<br>
described blow.<br>
(1)	Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight of polylactic<br>
acid was determined at 40Â°C with the use of<br>
tetrahydrofuran as an eluent by means of a gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC) device ( available from Shimadzu Co . ,<br>
Ltd. ) having a differential refractometer, and expressed<br>
on the basis of polystyrene calibration standards. A<br>
sample was dissolved in chloroform and diluted by THF.<br>
(2)	Flexural breakdown strength<br>
In conformity with ASTM-790, a test strip having<br><br><br>
a size of 150mmxl0mmx3 . 2 mm was prepared, and the flexural<br>
breakdown strength was measured with a load being applied<br>
to the test strip at a deformation rate of lmm/min.<br>
(3)	Melt flow rate (MFR)<br>
In conformity with JIS K7210, the melt flow rate<br>
was measured under conditions D specified in Table 1 of<br>
Appendix A of JIS K7210 (with a load of 21.2N at a test<br>
temperature of 190Â°C).<br>
(4)	Crystallization rate index (see Fig. 1)<br>
With the use of a DSC machine (Pyrisl DSC available<br>
form Perkin Elmer Corporation), a sample was heated at<br>
a temperature increasing rate of +500Â°C/min from 20Â°C to<br>
200Â°C, and kept at 200Â°C for 5 minutes. Then, the sample<br>
was cooled at a temperature decreasing rate of -500Â°C/min<br>
from 200Â°C to 130Â°C, and kept at 130Â°C for crystallization<br>
With the final crystal1inity (0) defined as 1, as shown<br>
in a graph of Fig. 1, time required for the crystallinity<br>
to reach 0.5 was determined as the crystallization rate<br>
index (min).<br>
(5)	Amount of terminal carboxyl groups<br>
First, 0.15g of a resin was dissolved in 20ml of<br>
methylene chloride, and an indicator (Phenol Red) was<br>
added to the resulting solution. Then, the solution was<br>
titrated with a 0.IN KOH solution.<br>
(6)	Evaluation of injection moldability<br>
With the use of ai injection molding machine<br>
(IS-100E available from Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd.), a<br>
resin was injection-mo ded in a releasable cup mold<br>
(having a diameter of 3 8mm and a height of 300mm and kept<br>
at a temperature of 110Â°C) at a molding temperature of<br>
200Â°C, and a minimum cycle time required for proper<br>
release of a cup was determined.<br>
(7)	Evaluation of hydrolysis resistance<br>
A test strip having a size of 15Ommx10mmx3.2mm in<br>
conformity with ASTM-790 and pellets were stored in a<br>
constant temperature/constant humidity chamber (Model<br><br><br>
IW221 available from yamato Science Co., Ltd.) at a<br>
temperature of 60Â°C and a humidity of 95% for 15 to 30<br>
days. Then, the flexural breakdown strength of the test<br>
strip was measured, and the MFR of the pellets was<br>
measured after the pellets were dried at 50Â°C for 50 hours<br>
in a vacuum condition. The flexural breakdown strength<br>
was evaluated as a retention ratio (%) which was<br>
determined on the basis of an initial flexural breakdown<br>
strength.<br>

D. Layered silicate<br>
â¢	SBN-E: Montmorilloni:e with its interlayer ions<br>
replaced by t rimethyloc.t adecylammonium ions (available<br>

â¢	MEE: Synthesized fluorinated mica with its interlayer<br>
ions replaced by dihydroxyethylmethyldodecylammonium<br>
ions (available from Corp Chemical Co., Ltd. and having<br>
an average particle diameter of 6.3(j.m)<br>
Example 1<br>
First, 100 parts by mass of the resin A and 0.8 parts<br>
by mass of the terminal blocking agent CDI were<br>
dry-blended and supplied into a hopper of a biaxial<br>
extruder (PCM-30 available from Ikegai Co., Ltd., and<br>
having a die having three 4-mm diameter holes, an<br>
extrusion head temperature of 210Â°C and a die outlet<br>
temperature of 190Â°C). Then, a solution containing 0.2<br>
parts by mass of PEGDM and 0 ,. 4 parts by mass of the<br>
crosslinking assist agent dissolved in 1 part by mass<br>
of an acetyltributyl citrate plasticizer was injected<br>
into a middle portion of a kneader by means of a pump.<br>
The resulting mixture was extruded, pelletized and dried.<br>
Thus, an aliphatic polyester resin composition was<br>
prepared. The results cf the evaluation of the physical<br><br><br>
properties and the hydrolysis resistance of the<br>
composition thus prepared are shown in Table 1.<br>
Examples 2 to 18 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6<br>
Resin compositions were prepared in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 1, except that different<br>
types and amounts of biodegradable polyester resins,<br>
crosslinking agents, lamellar silicates and terminal<br>
blocking agents were ised as shown in Table 1. Then,<br>
the resin compositions were evaluated. The results of<br>
the evaluation are shown in Table 1. In Examples 5, 6,<br>
8, 9, 11, 12 and 13 ard Comparative Example 4, the<br>
addition of the layered silicate was achieved by<br>
dry-blending the biodegradable polyester resin and the<br>
layered silicate and supplying the resulting mixture<br>
into the hopper.<br>
Example 19<br>
First, 100 parts b/ mass of the resin A was supplied<br>
into the hopper of the same biaxial extruder as employed<br>
in Examples 1 to 18. Then, a solution containing 0.2<br>
parts by mass of PEGDM and 0.4 parts by mass of the<br>
crosslinking assist agent dissolved in 1 part by mass<br>
of an acetyltributyl citrate plasticizer was injected<br>
into a first feed port provided at the middle of the<br>
kneader (a feed port closest to the hopper) by means of<br>
a pump, and 1.5 parts by mass of the terminal blocking<br>
agent CDI was supplied into a second feed port by a feeder,<br>
The resulting mixture was extruded, pelletized and dried,<br>
Thus, an aliphatic polyester resin composition was<br>
prepared. The results of the evaluation of the resin<br>
composition are shown ;.n Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 1 (to be continued)<br><br>
32<br><br>
Table 1<br><br>
* Symbol - in evaluation means that measurement was impossible. (For flexural breakdown strength, test strips had strength insufficient for<br>
the measurement. For MFR, samples had an extremely reduced molecular weight such that polymer's nature was lost.)<br>
* Crosslinking agent and terminal blocking agent were added in this order in Example 19, and in reverse order in other examples.<br>
33<br><br>
As apparent fron Table 1, the resin compositions<br>
of Examples 1 to 19 were excellent in injection<br>
moldability with higher crystallization rate indices.<br>
These resin compositions maintained their physical<br>
properties (e.g., strength) even after having been<br>
stored under the severely humid and hot conditions for<br>
the evaluation of the hydrolysis resistance.<br>
On the contrary, the resin composition of<br>
Comparative Example 1 had a lower crystallization rate,<br>
a longer injection molding cycle and a poorer moldability,<br>
because no crosslinking agent was added. Further, the<br>
hydrolysis resistance was poorer.<br>
The resin compositions of Comparative Examples 2<br>
to 6 had virtually no hydrolysis resistance, because no<br>
terminal blocking age it was added.<br>
Further, the following facts are revealed.<br>
A comparison between Example 2 and Comparative<br>
Example 1 shows that the resin composition of Example<br>
2 with the polylactic acid crosslinked by the PEGDM had<br>
a significantly higher crystallization rate and a<br>
significantly shorter injection molding cycle than the<br>
resin composition of Comparative Example 1. Although<br>
the same type and amount of terminal blocking agent was<br>
used, the resin composition of Example 2 was more<br>
excellent in hydrolysis resistance. Therefore, the<br>
resin composition prepared by utilizing the terminal<br>
blocking and the crosslinking in combination was more<br>
excellent in physical property retention under the high<br>
temperature and high humidity conditions than the<br>
terminal-blocked resin.<br>
A comparison between Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative<br>
Example 2 shows that the resin compositions of Examples<br>
1 to 4 maintained their physical properties even after<br>
having been stored under the high temperature and high<br>
humidity conditions for the evaluation of the hydrolysis<br>
resistance, because proper amounts of the terminal<br><br><br>
blocking agent were used for the terminal blocking. In<br>
Examples 1 to 4, different amounts of the terminal<br>
blocking agent ranging from 0.5 to 8 parts by mass were<br>
added and, as a result, it was found that the physical<br>
property retention ratio was increased correspondingly<br>
to the amounts of the added terminal blocking agent.<br>
In Examples 5 and 6, the addition of the layered<br>
silicate increased the crystallization rate thereby to<br>
reduce the injection mo1ding cycle as compared with<br>
Example 3 in which the resin composition was prepared<br>
substantially in the same manner except that no layered<br>
silicate was added. Although Example 5 and Comparative<br>
Example 3 differ in whether or not the terminal blocking<br>
agent was added, the resin composition of Example 5 with<br>
the terminal-blocked resin maintained its physical<br>
properties even after having been stored under the high<br>
temperature and high humidity conditions for the<br>
evaluation of the hydrolysis resistance.<br>
Examples 7 to 9 in which the polylactic acid was<br>
crosslinked by the isocyanate compound (HMDI) provided<br>
the same effect as Examples 3, 5 and 6 in which the<br>
polylactic acid was crosslinked by the PEGDM.<br>
In Examples 10 and 11, the blend of the polylactic<br>
acid and the copolymer of terephthalic acid, adipic acid<br>
and 1, 4-butandiol was used as the biodegradable resin,<br>
but the addition of the crosslinking agent or the<br>
addition of the crossl Inking agent and the layered<br>
silicate increased the crystallization rate and reduced<br>
the injection molding cycle. Although Examples 10 and<br>
11 differ from Comparative Examples 5 and 6 in whether<br>
or not the terminal blocking agent was added, the resin<br>
composition with the terminal-blocked resin maintained<br>
its physical properties: even after having been stored<br>
under the high temperature and high humidity conditions<br>
for the evaluation of the hydrolysis resistance.<br>
In Examples 12 and 13 in which the resin was<br><br><br>
terminal-blocked by the epoxy compound and the oxazoline<br>
compound, respectively, the physical properties were<br>
maintained even after .storage under the high temperature<br>
and high humidity conditions for the evaluation of the<br>
hydrolysis resistance.<br>
In Examples 14 and 15 in which CDP and CDC were<br>
respectively employed as the terminal blocking agent<br>
unlike in Example 1, the crystallization rate indices<br>
and the injection molding cycles were equivalent to those<br>
of Example 1, and the hydrolysis resistance was slightly<br>
improved as compared with Example 1.<br>
In Example 16 in which EX was employed as the<br>
terminal blocking agent unl:.ke in Example 1, the<br>
crystallization rate index, the injection molding cycle<br>
and the hydrolysis resistance were slightly improved as<br>
compared with Example 1.<br>
In Examples 17 and 18, the (meth)acrylate compound<br>
having shorter ethylene glycol chains was employed<br>
instead of PEGDM for the crosslinking, but physical<br>
properties equivalent to those of Example 3 were<br>
provided.<br>
In Example 19, the crosslinking agent and the<br>
terminal blocking agent, were added in reverse order as<br>
compared with Examples 1 to 18. As a result, the<br>
crystallization rate and the injection molding cycle<br>
were equivalent to those in Examples 1 to 3, but the<br>
hydrolysis resistance was slightly poorer even with the<br>
addition of a greater amount of the terminal blocking<br>
agent as compared with Examples 1 to 3. However, the<br>
hydrolysis resistance vas significantly improved as<br>
compared with Comparative Example 1 in which the<br>
crosslinking agent was not added. Therefore, the resin<br>
composition of Example 19 hac. sufficiently practical<br>
propert ies.<br><br><br>
