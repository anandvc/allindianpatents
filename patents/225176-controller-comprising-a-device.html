				<td>CONTROLLER COMPRISING A DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to control devices and more particularly is concerned with<br>
such devices which respond to input forces or torques in three dimensions and permit a control signal<br>
to be derived for controlling a machine such as a computer controlled system or the like. However,<br>
devices embodying the invention may be applied to other uses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present inventor is also an inventor of inventions in this field relating to three<br>
dimensional force and torque sensing devices which are the subject of US patents 4,811,608;<br>
5,222,400; 5,706,027 and 5,798,748.<br>
A further prior published proposal in the field is US 4,589,810 Heindl et al.<br>
In recognising this other prior published material, the inventor does not admit that any of<br>
these other proposals are necessarily known to persons working in the field or of that of common<br>
general knowledge in any particular country.<br>
The inventors prior patent number 4,811,608 discloses a six arm device where the arms are<br>
orthogonally arranged and responses in the arms to force or torque with respect to any axis in three<br>
dimensions are monitored using sensors.<br>
The inventor has now appreciated that new and useful alternatives to his own prior art and<br>
other prior art items disclosed above would be highly advantageous and the present invention is<br>
concerned with such alternatives.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In summary the invention may be described as a<br>
controller having four and only four arms extending from a<br>
body portion which is adapted to support the device, the<br>
arms being spaced from one another in three dimensions and<br>
the device having six or more degrees of constraint, tip<br>
portions of each of the arms engaging in connection means<br>
providing restricted relative motion, the connection means<br>
being attached to a gripping means which • can apply force<br>
and/or torque in a three dimensional sense, the device<br>
including response detection means for monitoring<br>
responses in at least three of the four arms to provide an<br>
output signal representative of force and/or torque<br>
applied through the gripping means.<br>
In some embodiments the device is arranged to control<br>
a system with the signal.<br>
The arms may be arranged in a tetrahedron shaped<br>
envelope and optionally are almost equally spaced from one<br>
another in a symmetrical sense with included angles of<br>
approximately 109°. However a small degree of non-symmetry<br>
is advantageous to ensure there is some preloading<br>
mechanically which addresses friction issues yet provides<br>
a device in which the computer based system can rapidly<br>
perform the relevant calculations that derive an accurate<br>
output signal.<br>
Most usefully the arms are constrained such that the<br>
device has eight degrees of constraint.<br>
This may be achieved by the tip of each arm having a<br>
ball element which is slidable along a cylindrical bore<br>
associated with the connection means and rotatable within<br>
reasonable limits inside the bore. Thus each such<br>
connection has freedom to engage in translational movement<br>
along the axis of the bore and limited freedom to rotate.<br>
The ball joint is thus constrained in two directions<br>
 defining a plane at right angles to the axis of the bore<br>
and there are four dimensions of freedom in total and two<br>
constraints at each joint.<br>
Optionally, the sensors for monitoring response in the arms are disposed around a circular<br>
path in a plane. The sensors may advantageously be an optically based system.<br>
The optical system can detect very accurately extremely small deflections in the arms<br>
responsive to the applied force or torque.<br>
Another embodiment is one in which six sensors are provided in an array so that<br>
displacements in an X-Y set of directions for each of the four arms is achieved giving eight readings<br>
which can be resolved to give the required output signal.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of optical<br>
sensors as component parts of the response detection means. These optical sensors are concentric and<br>
disposed on the same plane.<br>
The six sensors may optionally be configured in pairs around three of the four arms.<br>
The present invention, embodiments of which have been described above, may be usefully<br>
arranged as a component of a computer system whether incorporated as an external facility or as an<br>
integral sub-system.<br>
By way of technical background, an explanation of principles which may further explain the<br>
invention or some of its embodiments will be given. Further features of a preferred embodiments<br>
will also be explained.<br>
The constraint relationship between two bodies can be determined by summing the<br>
constraints of the joint or joints between the two bodies excluding mechanisms which have special<br>
geometric alignments. A perfectly constrained device would have exactly six degrees of constraint.<br>
Perfectly constrained designs require high joint tolerances to avoid a rattling due to the joint<br>
clearances or to avoid excessive friction of the joints<br>
due to interference. In practice a slight interference<br>
renders the product unusable so perfectly constrained<br>
designs tend to exhibit a small amount of rattle due to<br>
the clearances in the joints. It is also desirable to<br>
provide a small amount of damping through some friction of<br>
the joints.<br>
When a control device having a displaceable grip is<br>
designed/ it is useful to recognise that when the grip is<br>
released damping avoids vibration issues and avoids the<br>
requirements of a very lightweight grip, as is the case<br>
with purely spring-based designs. The friction of a<br>
perfectly constrained design, when the grip is released,<br>
is only dependent upon the weight of the grip and the<br>
fractional properties of the materials and hence is not<br>
adjustable in a typical design.<br>
Overconstrained designs can be easily preloaded by<br>
slightly offsetting either side of a joint. Optionally<br>
only a small overconstraint is used to avoid tolerancing<br>
issues. A preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
is slightly overconstrained with eight degrees of<br>
constraint. This allows the arms of the tube protrusions<br>
to be offset slightly relative to the connection means<br>
such as the cylindrical bores to introduce a slight<br>
preload when the device is at rest.<br>
Durability of a design is impacted heavily by the<br>
wear characteristics of a joint. In perfectly constrained<br>
designs with point contact a small amount of wear<br>
increases the slop of the joint resulting in increased<br>
rattle of the device. The present preferred embodiments<br>
have line contact joints that wear much more slowly than<br>
point contact. In conjunction with a small preload the<br>
device does not exhibit slop.<br>
The preferred embodiment has a central body and arms<br>
moulded as a single unit to form a four-armed, generally<br>
star-shaped body which for convenience in this<br>
specification will be known as a "tetra-star" to provide<br>
rigid mounting of the arms of the body and to reduce cost.<br>
A complex tool is required to mould the central star part<br>
and each arm is formed by three sections of the tool. The<br>
preferred embodiment has spherical tipg that engage with<br>
bores in an outer ball or shell which forms the grip. The<br>
mould has three parting lines. To avoid any flash from<br>
affecting the operation of the ball-in-hole joints, the<br>
ideal spherical surface is optionally cut back along the<br>
parting lines with a cylindrical surface so the flash will<br>
not touch the surface of the cylindrical bore associated<br>
with the outer ball.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, there is an inner ball<br>
structure for mounting the tetra-star and comprising a<br>
lower and an upper section. Four holes in the inner ball<br>
are provided for the cylindrically bored extensions from<br>
the outer ball to pass through and engage the tetra-star's<br>
arms. These holes also limit the range of motion of the<br>
extensions and prevent the arms from being overstressed.<br>
Impact loads are passed directly from the extensions to<br>
the inner ball structure thereby avoiding damage of the<br>
tetra-star's arms so that a robust design is achieved.<br>
Preferred embodiments use infrared LEDs and<br>
photodiodes to detect the tetra-star's arm displacements.<br>
Only six sets of sensors are required for the full 3D<br>
force and 3D torque computation. These are optionally<br>
arranged as three pairs with one arm having no sensors.<br>
Two pairs on two arms and the other two arms with a single<br>
sensor is also possible but less desirable. Similarly<br>
eight sets of sensors could be used with a pair for each<br>
arm. Each arm would optionally have the optical axes<br>
perpendicular to each other.<br>
In the preferred embodiment a shadow mask technology<br>
is used for sensing the displacement using an infrared LED<br>
and an infrared photodiode. The use of infrared provides<br>
greater immunity from ambient light affecting the<br>
 measurement. Light falling on the photodiode from the LED<br>
generates a small current. As the arm deflects, the<br>
amount of light varies and in turn the amount of current varies. Greater linearity is achieved by<br>
keeping the voltage across the photodiode constant using an appropriate circuit. Each<br>
LED/photodiode pair has a characteristic loss factor measured as the ratio of the LED drive current<br>
vs. the photodiode output current with no shadow. This is typically around 200:1. For good<br>
accuracy the drive circuitry and/or computation needs to compensate for the variation in loss factor.<br>
The preferred embodiment has ball-in-hole joints being 2 degree-of-constraint joints. These<br>
have line contact between the spherical ball-tip surface and the whole surface.<br>

Figure 6 is a schematic view similar to the view of Figure 3, however the tetra-star<br>
component is viewed along the axis of one of the arms. This view also shows one of<br>
the optics sub-assemblies. The tip of the arm has been excluded to provide a better view of the optics<br>
sub-assemblies.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The principal components of the device comprise a tetra-star body 10 base, an inner bowl<br>
shaped cap 12 and an outer cap 13 formed from segments, one of which is shown in figure 4.<br>
The tetra-star 10 has four arms 14 extending along respective axes from central body 15, the<br>
axes, being substantially uniformly geometrically disposed relative to one another. Each arm 14 has<br>
an elongated reduced cross-section cylindrical portion 14A extending from a tapered base 16 and<br>
leading to a tip 17 having an enlarged head with, the surface profile including substantially a<br>
spherical portion 18 with a flattened end face 19. A series of structural webs 20 are individually<br>
formed on the tetra-star body.<br>
The inner cap 12 has apertures 30 for accommodating tubular retainers 24 associated with<br>
the outer cap 13 and thereby limited displacement of the cap 13 (which acts as a grip).<br>
As most clearly seen in figure 2 one of the arms extends substantially vertically upwards<br>
and, as described above, a preferred embodiment has optical sensing for detecting flexing in the<br>
arms. Figure 2 shows schematically a photo detector unit 21 having a light emitting diode (LED) 22<br>
and photo detector 23.<br>
Each of the arms 14 is constrained with line contact in a respective tubular retainer 24 which is<br>
integrally formed with and projects inwardly from the respective cap segments of 13 to engage the<br>
tips 17.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5 and 6 small cut-outs 31 in each<br>
of the three lower printed circuit boards PCB) 32<br>
provides clearance for the assembly of the photo detector<br>
unit 21 into the inner cap 12- Each of the three lower<br>
PCBs 32 mounts a printed circuit board interface 34. There<br>
are three triplets of optics subassembly supports 35<br>
protruding from the structural webs 20 to easily and<br>
accurately mount respective optics subassemblies 36 which<br>
include the PCB 32 and two photo detector units 21.<br>
The PCB interface 34 provides interconnections for<br>
the optics subassemblies 36 and mounts interface<br>
electronics (not shown). A ribbon cable (not shown) is<br>
soldered to the PCB interface 34 and runs inside a stem 11<br>
for connection to external electronics (not shown).<br>
The top and bottom sections of the inner cap 12<br>
respectively include three pairs of clips 37 and three<br>
pairs of clip apertures 38 for inter-engagement. The stem<br>
11 has three screw bosses (not shown) for mounting the<br>
device to a base (not shown), a ribbon cable exit slot and<br>
a keying slot to ensure the device is mounted correctly.<br>
The edges of the segments of the outer cap 13 have<br>
interlocking tabs 39 for mutual attachment and assembly.<br>
These tabs 39 require all four parts of the outer cap 13<br>
to be assembled at the same time. The interlock design of<br>
the tabs 39 require a simple two-part moulding tool for<br>
manufacture. Although the segments of the outer cap 13<br>
mechanically engage, the segments are glued for strength.<br>
Figure 6 clearly shows how the arms 14 are offset<br>
from the light omitting diodes 22 and corresponding photos<br>
detectors 23 such that the variation in light due to the<br>
deflection of the arms 14 can be easily measured.<br>
The tetra-star 10 is designed for plastic injection<br>
 moulding. Notably, the spherical portion 18 of each arm 14<br>
needs to be accurate and has sections profiled to keep any<br>
moulding flash below the spherical portion 18. The type of<br>
plastic needs to have a good fatigue life to handle the<br>
repetitive bending stresses imposed on the arms 14 and it<br>
should have low friction with the outer cap material.<br>
Delrin® is a suitable material for the tetra-star 10.<br>
The arrangement is such that the application of force<br>
or torque through the outer cap 13 with respect to any<br>
axes is detected by a characterising flexing in the arms.<br>
This flexing can be detected and computation determines<br>
the appropriate signal to be directed to a device such as<br>
a computer.<br>
As the outer cap 13 is moved, the four tubular<br>
retainers 24 push on the four arms 14 deflecting them so<br>
they oppose the displacement of the outer cap 13. Ignoring<br>
the very small and hence insignificant frictional<br>
components, each arm tip 17 force vector can be considered<br>
as a 2D force vector lying in a plane normal to the<br>
corresponding axis of the tubular retainer 24. A<br>
simplifying assumption is made that each plane remains<br>
stationary as the outer cap 13 moves. The very small<br>
errors due to this assumption are insignificant. The<br>
deflection of each arm tip 17 is proportional and in the<br>
same direction as the 2D force vector. Using standard<br>
engineering mathematics, each 2D force vector acting<br>
through a arm tip 17 can be transformed into a 3D force<br>
vector and a 3D torque vector acting through the centre of<br>
the device. The 3D force vector and 3D torque vector<br>
acting on the outer cap 13 is then calculated by summing<br>
the four 3D force vectors and summing the four 3D torque<br>
vectors respectively.<br>
The force vector 13 acting on an arm tip 17 is<br>
proportional to the deflection measured by the photo<br>
detector unit 21 (or sensor 21) located part way down the<br>
length of the arm 14. The ratio of the force on the arm<br>
tip 17 to the measured deflection is constant and can be<br>
measured experimentally or calculated from an arm's spring<br>
constant combined with geometric calculations of the shape<br>
of a deflected arm 14. Given the constant ratio, the force<br>
is easily calculated from the deflection by<br>
multiplication.<br>
From engineering theory a minimum of six single value<br>
sensors are required to measure a simultaneous 3D force<br>
vector and 3D torque vector. Clearly, a device with four<br>
pairs of sensors, a pair for each arm, is functional. A<br>
device with three pairs of sensors can be used if the<br>
fourth 2D force vector can be calculated from the other<br>
three. Consider the device of Figure 5 where the lower<br>
three arms 14 have sensors 21 but the top arm 14 does not.<br>
Using each of the three measured 2D force vectors the<br>
force component tangential to a circle, centred on the<br>
centre of the device and passing through the centre of the<br>
top arm tip 17, is calculated. These three force vector<br>
components are then mathematically rotated so as to act<br>
through the centre of the top arm's tip 17. These three<br>
force vectors are then summed to calculate the 2D force<br>
vector associated with the fourth arm 14.<br>
It is helpful to consider the simple situation where<br>
the outer cap 13 is pushed downwards by a force acting<br>
through the centre of the device. The top arm 14 does not<br>
deflect but the lower three arms 14 deflect downwards<br>
sharing the load equally. The required tangential<br>
components happen to be the same as their respective 2D<br>
force vectors. Rotating these force vectors so that they<br>
act through the centre of the top arm 14 results in three<br>
equal force vectors acting 120° to each other and<br>
therefore adding to zero as expected.<br>
It is also theoretically possible to have a device<br>
with two pairs of sensors 21 on two arms 14 and two single<br>
sensors 21, appropriately oriented, on the other two arms<br>
14. <br>
