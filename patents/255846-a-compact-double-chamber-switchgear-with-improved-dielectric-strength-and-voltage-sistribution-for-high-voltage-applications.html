FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electrical switchgear with two switches<br>
arranged in the switchgear enclosure and electrically connected in series whereat<br>
each of the switches comprises a first and second contact, at least one of the<br>
first and second contact of each switch being a mobile contact, the first contacts<br>
of the two switches are mechanically and electrically connected by means of a<br>
connecting means, the first contact of a switch is at least partially surrounded by<br>
a first electrical conductive shield and the second contact of the switch is at least<br>
partially surrounded by a second electrical conductive shield.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrical switchgear, e.g. a circuit breaker, must in general provide good<br>
dielectric strength in open position in order to avoid breakthrough by arcing<br>
between the separated contacts or between a contact and a grounded part of<br>
the switchgear, like the grounded switchgear enclosure. To improve the dielectric<br>
strength capacitors are often arranged in parallel between the contacts of the<br>
switchgear. Due to the required capacitances which make the capacitor big and<br>
heavy such switchgear requires a lot of space. For very high voltage applications,<br>
e.g. &gt;500kV, two circuit breaker are connected in series for switching such high<br>
voltages, i.e. the voltage to be switched needs to be shared by the two switches.<br>
For such double chamber circuit breaker each circuit breaker is provided with a<br>
capacitor connected in parallel between the contacts of each switch for<br>
improving dielectric strength. Such a double chamber circuit breaker is shown in<br>
US 3 786 216 A. Some arrangements of prior art show either capacitors made by<br>
solid isulators integrated into single-chamber circuit breaker (allowing transitory<br>
voltage to be reduced particularly when short-line fault occur) and into two-<br>
chamber circuit-breaker (allowing to share the voltage equally by the chambers)<br><br>
or shields, e.g. made by metallic sheets, around the chambers for dielectric<br>
purposes.<br>
Examples of such switchgears are given in US 5 728 989 A or EP 335 338 A2.<br>
US 3 953 693 A shows a vacuum switch with integrated capacitor shields. Such<br>
vacuum<br>
switches can be used in series using the integrated capacitors to assure proper<br>
voltage<br>
distribution between the switches. The integrated capacitors are also effective as<br>
shields and serve as a labyrinth to shield against diffusions of arc products. To<br>
this end a number of shields are arrangend labyrinth-like to form a labyrinth<br>
passage which effectively intersects arc particels which are generated on<br>
separation of the contacts. To form a labyrinth a great number of such shields<br>
are required which leads to a costly design with great dimensions, especially<br>
diameters. Each switch is arranged in its own enclosure of insulating material.<br>
It is also known from prior art, e.g. from US 3 541 284 A, to employ a capacitor<br>
made of two tubular, concentric and partly overlapping shields in parallel to an<br>
electrical single-chamber switch to increase the inherent capacitance of the<br>
single-chamber switch, and consequently also its dielectric strength.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hence, it is an object of the present invention to provide a compact double-<br>
chamber switchgear for high voltage applications with improved dielectric<br>
strength and good voltage distribution between the two serially connected<br>
switches of the switchgear.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved by arranging the first and second shield such that a shield<br>
capacitor is formed between the first and second shield, by arranging the second<br>
shield that partially surrounds the connecting means so that a further capacitor is<br>
formed between the second shield and the connecting means and in that a<br>
second capacitor is formed between the, preferably grounded, enclosure of the<br>
switchgear and a connecting means.<br>
Such an arrangement increases the dielectric strength of the electrical switchgear<br>
signifi-cantly by increasing the natural capacitor between the open contacts of<br>
the switch thus reducing the rise of breakthrough and discharges when the<br>
switchgear is in open position.<br>
Since no bulky capacitors are required to improve the dielectric strength such a<br>
switchgear can be of compact design and reduced overall dimensions, espescially<br>
of reduced enclosure diameter. This means that the switchgear requires less<br>
space which is especially advantageous. Furthermore, since the costs of the<br>
shields are small compared to classical capacitors, such a switchgear is also<br>
cheaper than conventional ones. The large surface of the shields act also as<br>
radiative surface which increases the thermal capability of the switchgear and<br>
which is also advantageous for temperature rise tests.<br><br>
The dielectric strength of the switchgear is further increased, if the second shield<br>
is at least partially surrounding the connecting means so that a further capacitor<br>
is formed between the second shield and the connecting means. The further<br>
capacitor is parallel to the shield capacitor and the natural capacitance of the<br>
switch and increases consequently directly the capacitance of the switch further.<br>
Indeed, according to the example described below, the fact that the second<br>
shield (11) is at least partially surrounding the connecting means (4) so that a<br>
further capacitor (Ci'") is formed between the second shield (11) and the<br>
connecting means (4) is very relevant for the invention, because this increases<br>
capacitor CI (being CI +C1" + CI'"), and decreases capacitor C2, and thus<br>
improves voltage distribution between the two switching units, while the voltage<br>
ratio is C1/(C2+2C1) and thus its value tends towards 1/2.<br>
An especially compact design can be achieved when the connecting means is at<br>
least partially a drive unit for driving the mobile contact. This allows a very<br>
compact design of small diameters. The connecting means can also be at least<br>
partially the first shield which may in an advantageous embodiment extend from<br>
the first contact of the first switch to the first contact of the second switch.<br><br>
If the ratio between the capacitances of second and first capacitor is less than<br>
0,5, preferably less than 0,1 and especially less than 0,05, then the total voltage<br>
to be switched is substan-tially equally shared by the two switches.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventive electrical switchgear 1, e.g. a circuit breaker, is shown in Fig. 1<br>
and comprises an enclosure 5 into which two switches 2, 3 are arranged. The<br>
two switches 2, 3 are connected in series between two terminals T1 (e.g. high<br>
potential) and T2 (e.g. ground) by a connecting means 4. In order to perform a<br>
switching operation (open or close) a mobile contact 6 (indicated by the double<br>
arrow in Fig. 1) of both switches 2,3 is moved simultaneously by means of a<br>
drive unit acting also as connecting means 4 for mechanically and electrically<br>
connecting the two switches 2,3. The drive unit 4 is arranged between the<br>
switches 2, 3 and may comprise a number of levers and a driving rod 8<br>
mechanically connecting the drive unit 4 to a driving mechanism 9, in this<br>
example located outside the enclosure 5, as shown in Fig. 1. The drive unit 4 can<br>
be driven by a suitable driving mechanism 9, like e.g. a well-known spring<br>
mechanism, hydraulic mechanism or motor drive.<br><br>
The driving rod 8 itself may be of insulating material. The drive unit 4 is<br>
mechanically connected to a mobile contact 6 of each switch 2,3, thus driving the<br>
mobile contacts 6. A second contact 7 of each switch 2,3 is either fixed or could<br>
also be moveable to form a double acting circuit breaker. But basically, any other<br>
suitable drive unit or any other arrangement of one or more drive units could be<br>
employed as well, it would e.g. be possible that both contacts are moveable<br>
contacts and/or that each switch has its own drive unit.<br>
To allow an electrical connection between the terminals T1 and T2 of the<br>
switchgear 1, the second contact 7 of the first switch 2 is connected to terminal <br>
T1 e.g. the high voltage terminal. In closed position the first 6 and second<br>
contacts 7 of switches 2, 3 are in contact and the first contact 6 of the first<br>
switch 2 is electrically connected to the connecting means 4, in this example the<br>
drive unit, which is again electrically connected to the first contact 6 of the<br>
second switch 3 and hence, via second contact 7 of the second switch 3 also to<br>
terminal T2, e.g. the grounded terminal. In open position of the switches 2, 3 the<br>
contacts 6, 7 are separated and the electrical connection is interrupted.<br>
The switches 2,3 must have sufficient dielectric strength (i.e. the ability to<br>
withstand the maximum nominal voltage of the switchgear 1 without electric<br>
breakthrough) in order to<br><br>
prevent arcing between the two contacts 6, 7 in open position. In order to<br>
increase the dielectric strength of the switches 2, 3 or to allow a more compact<br>
design of the switchgear 1, the enclosure 5 could also be filled with insulating<br>
gas, e.g. like SF6. In conventional circuit breakers capacitors are often connected<br>
in parallel to the contacts of the switch which further increases the dielectric<br>
strength of the switch, as is well-known.<br>
The following is described with reference to only one of the switches 2,3 of the<br>
switchgear 1 because of the symetrical arrangement of the switches 2 and 3.<br>
The first contact 6 is partially surrounded by a first shield 10. The first shield 10<br>
is made of electrical conductive material and is electrically connected to the first<br>
contact 6 and hence also to the connecting means 4 (in this example the drive<br>
unit). Consequently, first shield 10 has the same electrical potential as first<br>
contact 6. An electrical conductive second shield 11 is arranged in the enclosure<br>
5 such that it is electrically connected to the second contact 7, thus having the<br>
same electrical potential as second contact 7, and that it is at least partially<br>
surrounding the first contact 6 and the first shield 10. The second shield 11 may<br>
also surround at least partially the connecting means 4, here the drive unit, as<br>
indicated in Fig. 1.<br>
But it would also be possible that the first shield 10 itself is at least partially the<br>
connecting means 4, e.g. by providing only one shield 10 which extends from the<br>
first contact 6 of the first switch 2 to the first contact 6 of the second switch 3.<br>
In this case the electrical connection between the two switches 2, 3 is at least<br>
partially formed by the shield 10.<br><br>
Due to the arrangement of the shields 10,11, additional capacitors are formed as<br>
is schematically shown in Fig. 2. Between the first (in this example mobile)<br>
contact 6 and the second (in this example fixed) contact 7 the natural capacitor<br>
C1 is formed between the two open contacts 6, 7. Between first shield 10 and<br>
second shield 11a shield capacitor C1" is formed and between second shield 11<br>
and connecting means 4, e.g. the drive unit, a capacitor C1" is formed. Since<br>
these three capacitors are connected in parallel, the capacitors can be combined<br>
to a first capacitor C1= C1 + C1 + C1'". Therefore, the natural capacitance of<br>
the switch 2 is increased and hence also the dielectric strength of the open<br>
switch 2. The longer the shields 10, 11 become, the greater the capacitance of<br>
capacitor C1' will be. The more the second shield 11 extends also over the<br>
connecting means 4, the greater the capacitance of capacitor C1' will be. Since a<br>
compact design of the switchgear 1 is desired it is advantageous to arrange first<br>
and second shield 10,11 as close together as possible, whereat the minimum<br>
distance is basically defined by the maximum voltage of the switchgear 1 and the<br>
media inside the enclosure 5 (e.g. SF6) which acts as insulator for the capacitors<br>
C1 and C2.<br>
Furthermore, a second capacitor C2 is formed between the grounded enclosure 5<br>
and the connecting means 4, e.g. the drive unit, which has the same electrical<br>
potential as the first contacts 6 of the switches 2, 3. The capacitance of capacitor<br>
C2 is the smaller, the more the<br><br>
second shield 11 extends over connecting means 4 and the shorter the<br>
connecting means 4 is.<br>
The resulting potential between the two switches 2,3 can easily be derived from<br>
the equivalent circuit diagram of the electrical switchgear 1 shown in Fig. 3. The<br>
closed switches are not shown in Fig. 3. Employing basic physical relationships,<br>
the middle voltage UM (i.e.the voltage between the first contacts 6 and terminal<br>
T2) can be found as Um=C1/(C2+2C1)-U, with U being the voltage between the<br>
terminals T1 and T2. From this equation it can gathered that the middle voltage<br>
UM is approximately U/2 if C1»C2. Therefore, it can be achieved that the total<br>
voltage to be switched is substantailly equally shared by the two switches 2,3<br>
connected in series by making the capacitance of capacitor C1 as big as possible<br>
and of capacitor C2 as small as possible.<br>
In an example the geometry of the switches 2,3 and the shields 10,11 (e.g.<br>
length, distance) can be chosen so that the capacitance of the first capacitor C1<br>
is 250pF and the capacitance of the second capcitor C2 to the earthed enclosure<br>
5 is 20pF. This would lead to a middle voltage UM=0.48.U which means that<br>
both switches 2, 3 would have about the same voltage to switch.<br>
Generally, C2 should be less than 0,5-C1 preferably less than 0,1 -C1 especially<br>
less than 0,05-C1, to achieve a good voltage distribution.<br>
From the above it can be followed, that it is advantageous to make the second<br>
shield 11 as long as possible and especially to extend shield 11 also over the<br>
connecting means 4 since this would increase C1" and C1" (and hence also C1)<br>
and would decrease C2.<br><br>
