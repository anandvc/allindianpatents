The invention relates to a 11-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivative, a process for the preparation thereof, a pharmaceutical composition containing the same, as well as the use of said derivative for the manufacture of a medicament.<br>
Various 11-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivatives are known in the art. For example in German Patent DE 3307143 steroids are described which may carry a variety of substituents at the 11-, 13-, 16- and 17-position. According to DE 3307143 these steroid derivatives have marked affinity to the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor and, in addition, they have reasonable affinity to the androgen receptor. Furthermore, in DE 3307143 it is shown that the steroid derivatives have anti-glucocorticoid activity.<br>
However, Philibert et al. [Agarwal MK (ed): Antihormones in Health and Disease. Front Horm. Res. Basel, Karger, 1991, vol. 19, pp 1-17] discovered that 11-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivatives disclosed in DE 3307143 are in vivo not very active anti-glucocorticoid steroids (e.g. the ll-(w-methoxyphenyl)-and ll-(w-methylthiophenyl)- derivatives) or have a relatively high progesterone receptor binding affinity (such as the ll-(p-methoxyphenyl)- and ll-(p-methylthiophenyl)- derivatives). These properties seriously restrict the therapeutic potential of the compounds. Low in vivo activity of the derivatives necessitates the administration of high dosages when they are used in therapy. It is very likely that the incidence of adverse side-effects is thereby increased. Furthermore, high progesterone receptor binding affinity may result in (anti)progestagenic activity, which means that the compound may display more than one (anti)hormonal activity, which limits its clinical use, especially for long-term therapy. Thus, there is a need for compounds having high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and, in addition, high in vivo anti-glucocorticoid activity, whereas other hormonal activities, such as androgenic and progestagenic activities, are low.<br>
It has now been found that ll-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivatives of formula I<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A is a residue of a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 2 heteroatoms which are not connected to each other and independently selected from O and S, the ring being optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms, or A is a residue of a 5- or 6-membered ring wherein no double C-C bonds are present, containing 1 heteroatom selected from O and S, which heteroatom is connected to the phenyl group at the position indicated with an asterisk, the ring being optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms; Ri is H or l-oxo(l-4C)alkyl; R2 is H, (l-8C)alkyl, halogen or CFs; X is selected from (H,OH), O, and NOH; and the interrupted line represents an optional bond, show specific and high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and are highly active in vivo showing predominant anti-glucocorticoid activity.<br>
The compounds lack appreciable affinity for mineralocorticoid, progesterone, oestrogen and androgen receptors, indicating a clean side effect profile.<br>
The 11-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivatives of the invention can be used in the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid dependent diseases or symptoms, like Gushing syndrome, diabetes, glaucoma, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, atherosclerosis, hypertension, adiposity, osteoporosis and withdrawal symptoms from narcotics and their mixtures.<br>
Preferred compounds according to this invention are 1 l-(substituted phenyl) estra-4,9-diene derivatives, wherein the heteroatom(s) are (is) O, the 5- or 6-membered ring being optionally substituted with one or more fluorine atoms; Ri is H; and X is O or NOH.<br>
More preferred compounds are 11-(substituted phenyl) estra-4,9-diene derivatives wherein A is a residue of a 5-membered ring. Particularly preferred are 11-(substituted phenyl) estra-4,9-diene derivatives wherein A contains 2 heteroatoms being O.<br><br>
Especially   preferred   are   ll-(substituted   phenyl)   estra-4,9-diene   derivatives wherein R2 is methyl and the interrupted line represents a bond. The   most   preferred   compound   is   (ll|3,17P)-ll-(l,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-17-hydroxy-17-( 1 -propynyl) estra-4,9-dien-3-one.<br>
The term halogen means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. Fluorine is the preferred halogen in ring A and when R2 is halogen, chlorine is preferred. The terms (l-4C)alkyl and (l-8C)alkyl, as used in the definitions of Ri and R2, respectively, mean alkyl groups having 1-4 and 1-8 carbon atoms, respectively, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, octyl.<br>
The 11-(substituted phenyl)-estra-4,9-diene derivatives according to the present invention can be prepared by a process wherein a compound of formula II<br><br>
wherein A, R2 and the interrupted line have the meanings as previously defined, Ri is H, and P is a protected keto-group, is dehydrated and deprotected, after which the 17p-0H is optionally esterified by reaction with an appropriate carboxylic acid to give a derivative wherein Ri is l-oxo(l-4C)alkyl, and optionally the 3-oxo group is converted into the corresponding 3-hydroxy- or 3-oxime derivative. The 3-oxo group can be reduced to form the 3-hydroxy-derivative by using a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride. The 3-oxime derivatives can be prepared by hydroxylamine treatment in a suitable solvent, like pyridine.<br>
The derivatives of formula II may be prepared according to well known methods described and used for the preparation of steroids.<br>
A suitable process for the preparation of derivatives of formula 11 starts from estra-4,9-diene-3,17-dione. Selective reduction of the 17-keto group to 176-OH,<br><br>
17a-H, e.g. with sodium borohydride, followed by protection of the 3-keto group, e.g. by ketalisation with ethyleneglycol, triethylorthoformate and p-toluenesulfonic acid, and oxidation of the 17-hydroxy group, e.g. with pyridinium chlorochromate, provides the 3-ketoprotected estra-5(10),9(ll)-diene-3,17-dione. Alkynylation at the 17-position (yielding a 17a-alkynyl,176-OH derivative), followed by epoxidation of the 5(10) double bond, e.g. with hydrogen peroxide, trifluoroacetophenone, and pyridine in dichloromethane according to the method as disclosed in European patent application EP 0 298 020, provides the 3-keto¬protected 5a, 10a-epoxy-17a-alkynyl-17B-hydroxy-estr-9(l l)-ene-3-one. Subsequently, compounds of formula II are formed from this epoxide derivative, for example by reaction with an organometallic compound of the formula<br>
wherein X is a (alkali)metal, like lithium, or a magnesiumhalide, preferably magnesium bromide.<br>
Suitable protective groups and methods to remove these groups are known in the art, for example from T.W. Green: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (Wiley, NY, 1981). Particularly suitable protective groups for the protection of keto groups are acetals, e.g. 1,2-ethylene ketal.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally, and for humans preferably in a daily dosage of 0.001-100 mg per kg body weight, preferably 0.01-10 mg per kg body weight. Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro et al.. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed.. Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture) the compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, e.g. for use as an injection preparation or eye drops, or as a spray, e.g. for use as a nasal spray.<br>
For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of<br>
the active compounds can be used.<br>
Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose,<br>
starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable<br>
amounts.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>

a)	A solution of ethyl magnesium bromide (prepared by reacting 19.3 g of Mg (788 mmol) and 58 ml of ethylbromide (775 mmol) in 1 1 of THF was cooled to 0-5 °C. 83 ml (1.46 mol) of propyn (previously condensed in a dry-ice/acetone-cooled cylinder) was bubbled slowly through this Grignard solution. Subsequently, 50 g (159 mmol) of estra-5(10),9(ll)-diene-3,17-dione-3-(cyclic 1,2-ethanediyl acetal) (see EP 0683172), dissolved in 200 ml of THF, was added dropwise to the solution with ice-cooling. Stirring was continued for one hour at ambient temperature. Work-up was accomplished by pouring the mixture into a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, followed by ethyl acetate extraction (2 times). The organic layers were washed with brine, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to give 58.4 g of crude 17a-propynyl-17p-hydroxy-estra-5(10),9(ll)-diene-3-one-3-(cyclic-l,2-ethanediyl acetal).<br>

The mixture was poured into water and the organic layer was separated and washed twice with a saturated sodium thiosulfate solution. Drying with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtering and evaporation provided a semi-solid residue. Crystallisation from diethyl ether provided 29.4 g of 5a,10a-epoxy-17a-propynyl-17P-hydroxy-estr-9(ll)-ene-3-one-3-(cyclic-l,2-ethanediyl acetal), m.p. 191 °C.<br><br>

temperature below 10 °C. Stirring was continued for one hour at ambient<br>
temperature. Work-up was accomplished by pouring the mixture into a saturated<br>
ammonium chloride solution and extraction with ethyl acetate (2 times). The<br>
combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried with anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. Trituration of the residue with<br>

H2SO4, the mixture was stirred for one hour. Then, the cold solution was poured<br>
into a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and the mixture was extracted with<br>
ethyl acetate (2 times). The combined organic layers were washed with brine,<br>
dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.<br>

Example 11<br>
In the following Table the receptor affinity of the compounds of the invention for glucocorticoid receptors (GR) related to progesterone receptors (PR) is presented. The glucocorticoid affinity of the compounds was measured for glucocorticoid receptors present in intact human multiple myeloma cells and compared with the affinity of dexamethasone (according to the procedure described by H.J. Kloosterboer et al., J. Steroid Biochem., Vol. 31, 567-571 (1988)). The progesterone affinity of the compounds was measured for cytoplasmic progesterone receptors present in human breast tumor cells and compared with the affinity of (16a)-16-ethy 1-21-hydroxy-19-norpreg-4-ene-3,20-dione (according to the procedure described by E.W. Bergink et al., J. Steroid Biochem., Vol. 19, 1563-1570 (1983)).<br><br>
From this Table it can be concluded that the 11-(substituted phenyl) estra-4,9-diene derivatives of the invention show specific and high glucocorticoid receptor affinity.<br>
