Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a serial receiver for a wireless communication<br>
system, a hadamard transform module, and a method and apparatus for generating an S<br>
matrix, and generally to a serial cancellation architecture for a Coded Signal Processing<br>
Engine (CSPE) that is designed for interference cancellation in the reception of coded<br>
signals in a spread spectrum system. More specifically, the CSPE may be used in a<br>
cascading sense for successive acquisition, tracking and demodulation of pseudorandom<br>
(PN) coded signals in the presence of interference in a CDMA system.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In spread spectrum systems, whether it is a wireless communication system, a<br>
Global Positioning System (GPS) or a radar system, each transmitter may be assigned a<br>
unique code and in many instances each transmission from a transmitter is assigned a<br>
unique code. The code is nothing more than a sequence (often pseudorandom) of bits.<br>
Examples of codes include Gold codes (used in GPS - see Kaplan, Elliot D., Editor,<br>
Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications, Artech House 1996), Barker codes (used<br>
in radar - see Stimson, G.W., "An Introduction to Airborne Radar", SciTech Publishing<br>
Inc., 1998) and Walsh codes (used in communications systems, such as cdmaOne - See<br>
IS-95). These codes may be used to spread the signal so that the resulting signal<br>
occupies some specified range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum or the<br>
codes may be superimposed on another signal, which may also be a coded signal.<br>
Assigning a unique code to each transmitter allows the receiver to distinguish<br>
between different transmitters. An example of a spread spectrum system that uses unique<br>
codes to distinguish between transmitters is a GPS system.<br>
If a single transmitter has to broadcast different messages to different receivers,<br>
such as a base station in a wireless communication system broadcasting to multiple<br>
mobiles, one may use codes to distinguish between messages for each mobile. In this<br><br>
scenario, each symbol for a particular user is encoded using the code assigned to that<br>
user. By coding in this manner, the receiver, by knowing its own code, may decipher<br>
the message intended for it from the superposition of message signals received.<br>
In some communication systems, a symbol is assigned to a sequence of bits that<br>
comprise a message. For example, a long digital message may be grouped into sets of<br>
M bit sequences where each unique sequence is assigned a symbol. For example, if<br>
M=6, then each set of 6 bits may assume one of 26 = 64 possibilities. Such a system<br>
would broadcast a waveform, called a symbol, which would represent a sequence of<br>
transmitted bits. For example, the symbol a might denote the sequence 101101 and the<br>
symbol β might denote the sequence 110010. In the spread spectrum version of such a<br>
system, these symbols are codes. An example of such a communication system is the<br>
mobile to base station (forward/down) link of cdmaOne.<br>
In some instances, such as in a coded radar system, each pulse is assigned a<br>
unique code so that the receiver is able to distinguish between different pulses by the<br>
codes.<br>
Of course, all of these techniques may be combined to distinguish between<br>
transmitters, messages, pulses and symbols in a single system. The key idea in all of<br>
these coded systems is that the receiver knows the code(s) of the message intended for<br>
it. By applying the code(s) correctly to the received signal, the receiver may extract the<br>
message for which it is intended. However, such receivers are more complex than<br>
receivers that distinguish between messages by time and/or frequency alone.<br>
Complexity arises because the signal received is a linear combination of all the coded<br>
signals present in the spectrum of interest at any given time. The receiver must be able<br>
to extract the message intended for it from this linear combination of coded signals.<br>
The following section presents the problem of interference in linear algebraic<br>
terms and provides a method by which it may be cancelled.<br><br>
Let H be a matrix containing the spread signal from source number 1 and let θ1<br>
be the amplitude of the signal from this source. Let si be the spread signals for the<br>
remaining sources and let ϕi be the corresponding amplitudes. Suppose that the receiver<br>
is interested in source number 1. The signals from the other sources may be considered<br>
to be interference. The received signal is:<br><br>
where n is the additive noise term, and p is the number of sources in the CDMA system.<br>
Let the length of the vector y be N, where N is the number of points in the integration<br>
window. The value of N is selected as part of the design process and is a trade-off<br>
between processing gain and complexity. N consecutive points of y will be referred to<br>
as a segment.<br>
In a wireless communication system, the columns of the matrix H represent the<br>
various coded signals of interest and the elements of the vector 0 are the amplitudes of<br>
the respective coded signals. For example, in the base station to mobile link of a<br>
cdmaOne system, the coded signals may include the various channels, i.e. pilot, paging,<br>
synchronization and traffic, of each base station's line-of-sight (LOS) or multipath<br>
fingers. In the mobile to base station link, the columns of the matrix H may be the<br>
coded signals from a mobile LOS or one of its multipath signals.<br>
In a GPS system, the columns of the matrix H are the coded signals of interest<br>
broadcast by the GPS satellites.<br>
In an array application, the columns of the matrix are steering vectors, or<br>
equivalent array pattern vectors. These vectors characterize the relative phase recorded<br>
by each antenna in the array as a function of the location and motion dynamics of the<br>
source as well as the arrangement of the antennas in the array. In the model presented<br>
above, each column of the matrix H signifies a steering vector corresponding to a<br>
particular source.<br><br>
Equation (1) may be written in the following matrix form:<br><br>
Receivers that are currently in use correlate the measurement, y, with a replica of<br>
H to determine if H is present in the measurement. If H is detected, then the receiver<br>
knows the bit-stream transmitted by source number 1. Mathematically, this correlation<br>
operation is:<br><br>
where T is the transpose operation.<br>
Substituting for y from equation (2) illustrates the source of the power control<br>
requirement:<br><br>
The middle term, (HTH)AHTSϕ, in the above equation is the source of the<br>
near-far problem. If the codes are orthogonal, then this term reduces to zero, which<br>
implies that the receiver has to detect 0 in the presence of noise, i.e. (HTH)-1HTn) only.<br>
As the amplitudes of the other sources increase, the term (HTH)~lHTSfy contributes a<br>
significant amount to the correlation, which makes the detection of 0 more difficult.<br><br>
The normalized correlation function, (HTH)1-HT, defined above, is in fact a<br>
matched filter and is based on an orthogonal projection of y onto the space spanned by<br>
H. When H and S are not orthogonal to each other, there is leakage of the components<br>
of S into the orthogonal projection of y onto H. This leakage is geometrically illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. Note in Figure 1, that if S were orthogonal to H, the leakage component is<br>
zero as is evident from equation 4. The CSPE provides a solution to this interference<br>
leakage issue.<br>
One way to mitigate this interference is to remove the interference in y by means<br>
of a projection operation. Mathematically, a projection onto the space spanned by the<br>
columns of the matrix S is given by:<br><br>
A projection onto the space perpendicular to the space spanned by the columns<br>
of S is obtained by subtracting the above projection Ps from the identity matrix (a matrix<br>
with ones on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else). Mathematically, this projection<br>
is represented by:<br><br>
The projection matrix Ps has the property that when it is applied to a signal of<br>
type Sϕ, i.e., a signal that lies in the space spanned by the columns of S, it completely<br>
removes Sϕ no matter what the value of ϕ. Namely, the projection is magnitude<br>
independent. This interference cancellation operation is illustrated in equation 7:<br><br>
When applied to the measurement vector y, it cancels the interference terms:<br><br><br>
Detection of the signal interest may then proceed with the processed<br>
measurement vector with the interference signal(s) S removed.<br>
This method of projections and interference cancellation may be incorporated as<br>
an improvement to the baseline receiver for spread spectrum signal reception.<br>
The present invention is a receiver with improved correlation properties that<br>
makes use of the principle of orthogonal projections as described in the patent<br>
applications identified and incorporated by reference above.<br>

Description<br>
The serial cancellation CSPE receiver incorporates the coded signal-processing<br>
engine (CSPE) into a spread spectrum receiver architecture in which interference<br>
cancellation is performed in a serial manner. Specifically, interference cancellation<br>
operations of single fingers, e.g., single LOS or multipath from a transmission source,<br>
on the measured data are performed in a serial, or cascading, manner, typically from<br>
highest to lowest power signals. Each processing finger may operate on the measured<br>
data y or on processed data in which one or more interference signals have been<br>
cancelled. One benefit of the serial approach is that a serial receiver processing-finger<br>
may acquire, track and demodulate a signal that is buried beneath the interference floor.<br>
A master control module controls data flow and control signals for all processing<br>
fingers. Depending on the power of the signals acquired, the CSPE may or may not<br>
cancel the interference of the previous signal(s).<br><br>
The serial architecture 200 is presented in Figure 2 in a generalized form with an<br>
arbitrary number of processing fingers 210, 212, 214. For clarity, only three processing<br>
fingers are illustrated. Particular embodiments, later described, will provide cdmaOne<br>
and cdma2000 specific elements of the present invention. Figure 2 depicts a serial<br>
receiver 200 and an arbitrary finger processor 260 containing finger 212 and illustrating<br>
the data flow therein. Signal 202 may either be processed at an intermediate frequency<br>
(IF) or at base-band (BB) frequency. The connections depicted in the subsequent<br>
figures may either be for a single IF signal or I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) base-band<br>
signals.<br>
A description of each element of Figure 2 is contained in the following<br>
subsections.<br>
Control<br>
Control block 206 controls data flow for all processing fingers 210, 212, 214in<br>
receiver 200, i.e., it determines which data stream, time offsets, projection operators and<br>
other parameters are sent to each processing finger 210, 212, 214. Moreover, it<br>
maintains a master time or an equivalent method of representing time of arrival that is<br>
used by all the processing fingers for the determination of code offsets in time.<br>
Controller 206 may be modified as desired to achieve particular network requirements.<br>
Note that it is to be understood that various changes and modifications may be made to<br>
controller 206 without departing from the teachings of the present invention. Such<br>
changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the<br>
present invention. For example, due to memory and other computational reasons it may<br>
be necessary to pass the interference matrix S to a module rather than the projection<br>
matrix .<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the inputs for controller 206 are illustrated as items<br>
202 and 204 and may include, but are not limited to: - data stream containing the<br>
transmitted signals where the j index specifies the number of interference signals that<br><br>
have been removed; 4 - time offset for the signal, where k is the signal index; <br>
projection operator, where the n index denotes the signal number while the k index<br>
specifies the number of interference signals that have been removed; P - estimate of the<br>
power of the tracked signals to determine which signals should be cancelled and in<br>
which order the signals should be cancelled; and Info - an optional parameter that may<br>
either specify relative signal amplitude of the signals or polarity of the bits transmitted.<br>
This information is specifically used for cancellation purposes. The minimum input<br>
parameters for cancellation purposes include: <br>
The outputs for controller 206 are illustrated as data elements 208, 210, 212,<br>
214, and 216. Each of these data elements may contain: - a data stream in which k<br>
interference signals have been removed; a product of the projection operators<br>
that is used to remove the k interference signals; and/or 4 - time offset for the Mi<br>
interference signal.<br>
Searcher Finger<br>
Searcher finger block 220 acquires a signal in the received data 208. Inputs for<br>
searcher finger block 220, include, but are not limited to: - a data stream in which j<br>
interference signals have been removed; and - a product of the projection<br>
operators, which is used to remove the k interference signals. Searcher finger block 220<br>
provides time offset and relative power information to finger processor 260. The time<br>
offset is a coarse approximation, the accuracy of which is further refined in the tracking<br>
loop or code offset estimation of finger processor 260. Searcher finger block 220 may<br>
operate on either the unprocessed segment of data or on a processed segment of data,<br>
which has been operated on by a projection operator in a processing finger's CSPE<br>
block in order to remove an interference signal(s).<br><br>
Depending on the constraints of the system, the searcher algorithm may take<br>
many forms. A standard CDMA searcher continually searches the unprocessed segment<br>
y 202 for new signals to be assigned to processing fingers 210, 212,214. Embodiments<br>
of the present invention have the capability to search within unprocessed data and the<br>
processed data, e.g., y(1), y(2), ..., y(n-1). For example, the searcher algorithm may focus<br>
its processing time on the y 202 with the greatest number of signals removed to<br>
facilitate the acquisition of signals buried by the interference, it could search each y<br>
alternatively for a short period of time or have additional searchers or correlators search<br>
y(1), y(2), y(n-1). The former has difficulties when the relative powers of the signals<br>
are changing and lingers are being reassigned because of the dependencies of<br>
cancellation ordering in the serial cancellation process. The latter may unnecessarily<br>
process y's with few or no signals cancelled, thereby decreasing the probability of<br>
acquiring additional signals since they may be buried beneath the interference floor of<br>
stronger signals. The addition of new searchers or correlators may be costly to<br>
implement. The complexity of the searcher algorithm is dependent on the parameters of<br>
receiver architecture.<br>
The use of any prior art searcher algorithm is considered within the scope of the<br>
present invention. As may be seen, the outputs from searcher finger block 220 are<br>
preferably, tm - time offset for the (m)th signal acquired by the searcher; and an estimate<br>
of signal power that is used to determine the order of the serial cancellation and to<br>
determine whether signal cancellation is required for the acquisition of particular<br>
signals. The output is illustrated by element 222. Outputs 222 may be utilized to<br>
facilitate the acquisition of signals buried by the interference or may search each <br>
alternatively for a short period of time, for simplicity, and may be provided to controller<br>
206 as input 204 for these purposes.<br>
Baseline Finger Processor<br>
Baseline finger processor 230 tracks a signal in the received data in 212. It<br>
provides time offset information tk+1 and an estimate of the tracked signal (reference<br><br>
signal) 232 to subsequent blocks in the processing finger for correlator 240 and for the<br>
construction of interference matrices 250. The inputs for baseline finger processor 230<br>
are illustrated by element 212 and include: - a data stream in which k interference<br>
signals have been removed; and - a product of the projection operators which<br>
is used to remove the k interference signals.<br>
If the data has been operated on by a projection operator in another processing<br>
finger's CSPE block 250, in order to remove an interference signal(s), then it will be<br>
necessary to use the projection operator(s) in the creation of a reference signal for<br>
correlation purposes. This is illustrated as one of the inputs in 232.<br>
As may be seen from Figure 2, the outputs from baseline finger processor 230<br>
are: - a product of the projection operators, used to remove the k interference<br>
signals, and a reference signal of the signal tracked in the baseline receiver where n<br>
specifies the signal index; and tk+1 — time offset for the (k+1)th signal tracked in the<br>
baseline receiver. These outputs are represented by element 232. As may be seen,<br>
output 232 is provided to both correlator 240 and CSPE 250.<br>
Correlator block 240 (shown in Figure 2) calculates a power estimate P in 244<br>
that is used by control block 206 to order the signals for serial cancellation. Namely, it<br>
determines whether a cancellation is necessary in each processing finger and in which<br>
order. Additionally, the parameter Info is provided that supplies either information on<br>
bits transmitted, relative power information or no information to control block 206<br>
depending on the receiver architecture. Information on bits transmitted or relative<br>
power is necessary for certain cancellation methods where there is bit boundary<br>
misalignment and where cancellation is performed on segments longer than one Walsh<br>
symbol as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/331,480, entitled<br>
"Construction of an Interference Matrix for a Coded Signal Processing Engine," the<br>
entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
As may be seen, the inputs for correlator 240 include: ■ a product of<br>
the projection operators that remove the k interference signals and an estimate of the<br>
signal tracked in the baseline receiver where n specifies the signal index; and tk+1 - time<br>
offset for the (k+1)th signal tracked in the baseline receiver. The outputs of correlator<br>
240 include: Info - either bits transmitted or relative signal amplitude information, if<br>
required by the cancellation method; and Power - estimate of signal power that is used<br>
to determine the order of the serial cancellation and to determine whether signal<br>
cancellation is required for the acquisition and/or tracking of particular signals.<br>
If the data has been operated on by a projection operator in another processing<br>
finger's CSPE block 250, in order to remove an interference signal(s), it will be<br>
necessary to use the projection operator(s) in the creation of a reference signal for<br>
correlation purposes. This is illustrated as one of the inputs in 232. The output of<br>
correlator 240 is illustrated by element 244 and comprises power and other signal<br>
information, as discussed above. Correlator 240 may be modified as desired to achieve<br>
particular network requirements.<br>
To track signal s1 from the original data .y, the data is correlated with a reference<br>
signal for s1 in block 240. However, to track a signal s„ after k interference signals have<br>
been removed, data is correlated with a reference signal , which is produced after<br>
multiplying the original s„ by the k corresponding projection operators, or by the<br>
reference signal . The flexibility in being able to use two different reference<br>
signals, i.e. either for the correlation operation with where i&gt;0, is due<br>
to the idempotent nature of projection matrices, <br><br><br>
In general, the reference signal being correlated with the measured data may either have<br>
as many projection operators applied to it as the measured data or all but the last<br>
projection operator. Consider the following correlation:<br><br>
Both the correlation and the correlation  are mathematically<br>
equivalent, though the latter is computationally more efficient since it requires the<br>
application of one fewer projection matrix.<br>
Application of a projection operator to a reference signal is straightforward when<br>
the symbol boundaries, of the signal to be cancelled, align with the boundaries of the<br>
signal for which one is looking, or the signal for which one is looking has no symbol<br>
boundaries. For example, when acquiring and tracking a signal using a pilot channel<br>
over a segment length equivalent to one Walsh symbol in cdmaOne and cdma2000, the<br>
symbol boundaries are not relevant since Walsh code zero, used for the pilot, is all<br>
zeros. However, misalignment issues may arise for signals with symbol boundaries<br>
when applying a projection operator to a reference signal.<br>
CSPE block 250 (shown in Figure 2) provides interference mitigation by<br>
generating a projection operator to cancel the interfering signals represented in the<br>
matrix S:<br><br><br>
In the serial canceller, the matrix S consists of the signal s tracked in the current<br>
processing finger and all channels to be cancelled. The processed data and the<br>
projection operator are sent to the control module for processing by subsequent<br>
fingers. The inputs for CSPE include:  a product of the projection<br>
operators, used to remove the k interference signals, and the signal tracked in the<br>
baseline receiver where the n specifies the signal index; tk+1 - time offset for the (k+l)th<br>
signal tracked in the baseline receiver; and, if required, Info - either bits transmitted or<br>
relative signal amplitude information. The outputs for CSPE include: - an estimate<br>
(reference signal) of the signal currently tracked in the processing finger; <br>
processed data stream in which k interference signals have been removed; <br>
processed data stream in which k+\ interference signals have been removed including<br>
the signal currently being tracked; tk+i - time delay for the (k+1)th signal tracked in the<br>
baseline receiver; and - projection operator for the removal of. <br>

A system has herein been discussed in which the symbol boundaries are aligned.<br>
It should be appreciated that the teachings of the present invention may be utilized even<br>
if the signal boundaries are not aligned. Figure 3 is a depiction of how a projection<br>
operator may be applied to a reference signal when symbol boundaries of a signal being<br>
cancelled are not aligned with the reference symbol boundaries of the signal of interest.<br>
Consider two signals s1 (310) and s2 (360), illustrated in Figure 3, where s1 is<br>
canceled to demodulate s2. As seen in Figure 3, the symbol boundaries for s1 and s2 are<br>
not aligned and are offset by ∆n. As a result, the projection operator, constructed to<br>
cancel si, is applied to the s2 reference signal such that it is aligned to the boundaries of<br>
s1 340, 342 344 and 346. However, when s2 is demodulated, the segment used for<br>
correlation is aligned to the boundaries of s2 380, 382, 384 and 386. Projection<br>
operators 320, 322, 324 and 326 are constructed over segments aligned with symbol<br>
boundaries of s1 and applied to s2 resulting in segments 330, 332, 334 and 336.<br>
However, in order to demodulate s2, it is necessary to correlate over segments 370, 372<br>
and 374.<br>
The correlation for demodulation may be written as<br><br>
where the '-' denotes that the projection operator is aligned to the symbol boundaries of<br>
s2 rather than with s1. As a result,  is mathematically not a true projection operator.<br>
Instead, it is composed of portions of two adjacent ]  operators that comprise the<br>
upper and lower portions of the   matrix. Since, in general, the resulting matrix is<br>
not a true projection matrix, it is not guaranteed to be idempotent. Therefore, in the case<br>
of demodulation with misalignment between what is being cancelled and what is being<br>
demodulated, the following statement is, in general, not true:<br><br><br>
Mathematically, it will then be necessary to always have the index n,<br>
corresponding to the projection operators, match between the data and the reference<br>
signal for demodulation purposes. In CDMA communication systems that use a pilot<br>
channel, acquisition and tracking of the pilot channel will be unaffected for a segment<br>
length corresponding to one Walsh symbol, since it is a non-information bearing<br>
channel with no symbol boundaries, and may exploit the idempotency of the projection<br>
operators by aligning with the segment corresponding to the projection operator.<br>
Another method, which would require a greater amount of computation and<br>
require either bit or amplitude information, is to cancel signal s1 from the data y to<br>
detect signal s2, determine the alignment of the symbol boundaries of signal s2, rebuild<br>
the projection operator to remove s1 from y aligned to the symbol boundaries of s2 and<br>
then correlate s2 over the segment corresponding to the boundaries of s2. Using this<br>
method would preserve idempotency even with misalignment between what is being<br>
cancelled and what is being detected. Therefore, in the case of demodulation with<br>
misalignment between what is being cancelled and what is being demodulated, the<br>
following statement is, in general, true for this method:<br><br>
However, from an implementation perspective, the correlation  may<br>
be replaced by the correlation where the projection operators) are not applied to<br>
the reference signal. Interference and the near-far effect are due to non-orthogonality of<br>
signals and a large disparity in power. If the signals that are cancelled are relatively<br>
orthogonal to the signal of interest, the projection operators have little effect on the<br>
reference signal for the signal of interest. As a result, the subspace angle between <br>
and sra is quite small and the vectors are similar. Therefore, the correlations <br>
and  may likely yield similar results. In the present invention, this may be<br>
exploited whenever a projection operator or product of projection operators are applied<br><br>
to a reference signal, e.g., demodulation of data; determination of active channel, bits or<br>
amplitude information; and construction of the interference matrix, greatly simplifying<br>
the implementation.<br>
Processing the data<br>
Suppose that the received data is composed of m signals ordered in terms of<br>
power from highest to lowest with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The data y<br>
may be written as<br><br>
where st denotes the rth signal, θi denotes the ith amplitude and n represents the noise<br>
term. Note a slight departure from previous convention in the prior art section where H,<br>
s, θ and ϕ were used. This change eliminates the need for H to be re-defined after each<br>
serial cancellation operation.<br>
The following procedure is an example of how the data processing may proceed.<br>
There is a minimum one segment computational delay between each processing finger<br>
in which a signal is removed. It is necessary to create a reference signal over an entire<br>
segment before it is cancelled from the measured data. Subsequently, another<br>
processing finger may process that segment of data with the previous signal removed.<br>
Figure 4 depicts processing delay due to the misalignment of symbol boundaries<br>
between fingers. The vertical lines occur at symbol boundaries, however, there may be<br>
more than one symbol per segment. Figure 4 shows finger 1, illustrated as reference<br>
numeral 410 and having segments 412, 414, 416, 418; finger 2, illustrated as reference<br>
numeral 420 and having segments 422, 424, 426, 428; and finger 3, illustrated as<br>
reference numeral 430 and having segments 432, 434, 436,438 where time increases in<br>
the direction of increasing segment reference number. The segments for each finger are<br>
misaligned as illustrated by the dashed lines. In order to process segment 422 with the<br>
interference of finger 1 (410) removed it is necessary to have processed segments 412<br>
and 414. Similarly, to process segment 424 with the interference of finger 1 (410)<br><br>
removed it is necessary to have processed segments 414 and 416. Furthermore, in order<br>
to process segment 432 with fingers 1 (410) and 2 (420) removed it is necessary to have<br>
processed segments 422 and 424 which subsequently require the processing of segments<br>
412, 414 and 416. Effectively, there may be at least a one-segment delay between each<br>
finger in which a cancellation occurs.<br>
When a receiver begins processing the data stream, the control block arbitrarily<br>
assigns reception of the strongest signal to a processing finger, hereafter referred to as<br>
the first processing finger. Moreover, processing fingers that track subsequent signals<br>
will be referred to as the second processing finger, the third processing finger,. .., nth<br>
processing finger, respectively. Relative ringer power may change during processing<br>
and either the fingers may be re-assigned to maintain a particular ordering of power or<br>
the control block may maintain a record of the order in terms of power and process<br>
accordingly.<br>
First Processing Finger:<br>
Control block 206 sends the raw received signal data y, but no information<br>
or time t information to the finger processing block 260 and y to CSPE block 250.<br>
Baseline block 230 calculates an estimate of the parameters corresponding to the signal<br>
of interest by correlating with a generated reference signal and the signal, offset delay<br>
t1 and potentially the phase and doppler frequency to CSPE block 250 and correlator<br>
block 240. CSPE block 250 generates the projection operator and operates on the<br>
data v to produce the processed data.y(1) with the first signal removed.<br><br><br>
For simplicity, any nonzero multiplicative operation on the noise term n will<br>
produce a product n, i.e., Xn = n. Moreover, is defined as <br><br>
CSPE block 250 sends the signal s1 and y to the combiner (not illustrated), if necessary,<br>
and the Viterbi decoder. In addition, and t1 are sent to control block 206.<br>
Correlator block 240 calculates a power measurement P and the Info term that is sent to<br>
control block 206.<br>
After the first processing finger acquires and tracks the strongest signal, control<br>
block 206 will attempt to acquire and track a second signal (multipath of first signal or a<br>
second transmitter). Control block 206 will make the determination of whether the<br>
acquisition procedure will operate on processed data with the strongest signal removed<br>
or if it will operate on the original data. This will determine which data and parameters<br>
are passed to the second processing finger.<br>
Second Processing Finger:<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, without loss of generality,<br>
the control block sends the processed data, and the time offset information t\ to<br>
the baseline finger processing block and to the CSPE block to effectively find a<br>
second signal with the strongest signal cancelled. The baseline finger processing block<br>
calculates an estimate of the next strongest signal by correlating with either the<br>
generated reference signal or S2 and sends the signal and offset delay fe to<br>
the CSPE and correlator blocks. The CSPE block generates the projection operator<br>
  and operates on the data, to produce the processed datay that has the second<br>
signal removed.<br><br><br>
The CSPE block sends the signal s2(1) and to the Viterbi decoder while <br>
  and are sent to the control block. The correlator block calculates the power<br>
measurement term P and the Info term that may be subsequently sent to the control<br>
block.<br>
The control block continues to compare the power measurement of the two<br>
transmitters. If the second measurement exceeds the power of the first, the control flow<br>
may change and the two processing fingers of the receiver will effectively switch roles.<br>
Namely, signal two will be removed from the data (if necessary) and then either the<br>
processed data or original signal will be sent to the processing finger operating on the<br>
first signal.<br>
After the second finger acquires and tracks the next strongest signal, the control<br>
block will attempt to acquire and track a third signal (multipath of the first or second<br>
signal or a second or third transmitter). The control block will make the determination<br>
of whether the acquisition procedure will operate on the data with either the two<br>
strongest signals removed, one of them removed or if it will operate on the original data.<br>
This will determine which data and parameters are passed to the third processing finger.<br><br>
Third Processing Finger:<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, without loss of generality,<br>
the second signal does not need to be removed and the control block sends the processed<br>
data and the time delay information t2 to the baseline receiver block and yw to<br>
the CSPE block to effectively find the third strongest signal with the signal in<br>
processing finger 1 removed. The baseline finger processing block calculates an<br>
estimate of the next strongest signal by correlating with a generated reference signal<br>
  or s3 and sends the reference signal and offset delay t3 to the CSPE and<br>
correlator blocks. The CSPE block generates the projection operator and operates<br>
on the data to produce the processed data that has the first and third signals<br>
removed. The prime denotes that different signals were cancelled than in the previous<br>
processing finger case, i.e., (2) refers to the cancellation of processing fingers 1 and 2<br>
whereas (2') refers to the cancellation of processing fingers 1 and 3.<br><br>
The CSPE block sends the signal to the Viterbi decoder while y(2),<br>
  and t3 are sent to the control block. The correlator block calculates a power<br>
measurement P and the Info term that may be subsequently sent to the control block.<br>
The control block continues to compare the power measurement of the three<br>
transmitters. If the relative powers switch order, then the control flow may change and<br>
the appropriate processing fingers of the receiver will effectively switch roles.<br><br>
Moreover, the CSPE may be turned on or off depending on the power requirements and<br>
the level of interference.<br>
Effectively, this procedure may be continued for an arbitrary number of<br>
processing fingers. Consider the nth processing finger in this process.<br>
Nth processing finger:<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, without loss of generality,<br>
the control block sends the processed data with k (k<n signals removed the product></n>
of the corresponding k projection operators  and the time offset<br>
information to the baseline receiver block and to the CSPE block to effectively<br>
find the nth strongest signal with k signals removed. The baseline block calculates an<br>
estimate of the tracking parameters of the next strongest signal by correlating with a<br>
generated reference signal and sends the signal and offset delay t„ to<br>
the CSPE and correlator blocks. The CSPE block generates the projection operator<br>
  and operates on the data to produce the processed data y(k+1) that has the nth<br>
signal removed.<br><br><br>
The CSPE block sends the signal and to the Viterbi decoder while <br>
  and tn are sent to the control block. The correlator block calculates a power<br>
measurement P and the info term that is subsequently sent to the control block.<br>
The control block continues to compare the power measurement of all the<br>
transmitters that are being tracked. If the ordering of the fingers, based on their relative<br>
power, changes, then the control flow may change and the appropriate processing<br>
fingers of the receiver will effectively switch roles. Moreover, the CSPE may be turned<br>
on or off for particular fingers depending on the power requirements and the amount of<br>
interference.<br>
The following particular embodiments present the cdmaOne forward link serial<br>
CSPE canceling receiver and the cdma2000 forward link serial CSPE canceling<br>
receiver, respectively.<br>
Example I<br>
The following embodiment is the cdmaOne (IS-95) forward link receiver. The<br>
cdmaOne serial cancellation CSPE receiver incorporates the coded signal-processing<br>
engine (CSPE) into a cdmaOne receiver architecture in which interference cancellation<br>
is performed in a serial manner as described above. Specifically, interference<br>
cancellation operations of single fingers, e.g., one or more channels from a LOS or<br>
multipath signal, are performed in a serial, or cascading, manner, typically ordered in<br>
terms of power from highest to lowest. Each processing finger may operate on the<br>
received data y or on processed data in which one or more interference signals have<br>
been cancelled. The benefit of this serial approach is that a serial receiver processing-<br>
finger may track and demodulate a signal that may otherwise be buried beneath the<br>
interference and may be undetectable by a baseline receiver. A master control module<br>
controls data flow and control signals for all processing fingers. Depending on the<br><br>
generality, the second finger is fed to finger processor 560 with data that has the strong<br>
signal removed. The signal is tracked, demodulated, an interference matrix is created<br>
and the signal is removed from the input data signal. The resulting signal has the first<br>
two tracked signals removed from it in a serial manner, i.e., successive cancellations.<br>
The process continues in a similar manner for the other finger processors.<br>
Searcher 540 may search the received data or data in which interference signal(s) have<br>
been removed in a serial manner. Multipath signals corresponding to the same base<br>
station are combined in a Rake receiver in module 590.<br>
In Figure 6, a searcher 600 (such as that shown previously in Figure 5, element<br>
540) is discussed in greater detail. The pilot Walsh code, which is all zeros, is<br>
multiplied by the short code in multiplier 610. If the input data y has had interference<br>
signals removed, then the product of multiplier 610 is multiplied by the corresponding<br>
projection matrices in multiplier 620. The reference signal computed in 620 is<br>
multiplied by the input data signal y in multiplier 630. The correlation procedure is<br>
completed by summing the product of y and the reference signal over a correlation<br>
length N in summation block 640. The short code multiplied in multiplication block<br>
610 is chosen such that the reference signal checks all possible code offsets.<br>
Comparator 650 uses standard methods to select the strongest signal. However,<br>
if a processing finger is already tracking a signal then that signal will not be reacquired.<br>
Moreover, if the receiver has enough signals (LOS and/or multipath signals) from one<br>
base station, the searcher may be instructed to not acquire any more multipath signals<br>
from the same base station. Depending on the searching algorithm, the control module<br>
may provide the searcher with either an unprocessed signal or one in which interference<br>
signal(s) have been removed.<br>
In Figure 7, a processing finger 700 (such as that shown previously in Figure 5,<br>
element 550) is discussed in greater detail. The parameters associated with the input<br>
signal y are refined in tracking loop(s) 710. Tracking loop(s) 710 may include a delay-<br><br>
power of the signals that are to be acquired, the CSPE may or may not cancel the<br>
interference of the previous signal(s).<br>
Figure 5 depicts a forward link receiver 500. An RF signal 502 is received by<br>
antenna 504 and then is down-converted by converter 510 from RF to base-band (BB)<br>
based on a nominal carrier frequency. It should be appreciated that the present<br>
invention encompasses receivers that process either base-band or IF. The base-band<br>
signal is then sampled in an analog to digital converter (A/D) 520 to create a digital<br>
signal. Control module 530 feeds the digital signal into searcher 540, which acquires<br>
the strongest signal finger and communicates the short code offset and possibly the<br>
Doppler frequency to control module 530. Searcher 540 continues to search over the<br>
code offsets in order to acquire another signal. Control module 530 feeds the data and<br>
acquisition information into one of the four processing fingers 550, 560, 570 and 580,<br>
respectively. While Figure 5 depicts four processing fingers, the present invention is not<br>
limited to a specific number of processing fingers but instead applies to an arbitrary<br>
number of fingers.<br>
Without loss of generality, assume for this example that the finger is assigned to<br>
finger processor 550. The finger processor tracks the finger, demodulates the signal,<br>
creates an interference matrix to cancel the signal and finally removes the signal from<br>
the input data signal. The demodulated signal is fed to demodulation module 590 that<br>
performs the Rake receiver combining as needed for multipath signals. The interference<br>
matrix and processed data are fed back to control module 530.<br>
With information from searcher 540 and the neighbor list for the finger tracked<br>
in processing finger 550, control module 530 will decide whether to track a multipath<br>
associated with the finger currently tracked in processing finger 550 or the signal of<br>
another base station. Control module 530 has searcher 540 search over the code offsets<br>
for other strong signals in either the received data or in the data with the interfering<br>
finger removed. The latter is done if the interference from the first signal is too strong<br>
to detect another signal or the removal will facilitate acquisition. Without loss of<br><br>
locked loop (DLL) or code offset estimation, a phase-locked loop (PLL) or phase<br>
estimation and/or a frequency-locked loop (FLL) or frequency estimation. At this point,<br>
this embodiment of the present invention differs from the standard baseline cdmaOne<br>
receiver architecture. The data flow is split between the architecture for signal<br>
demodulation and the CSPE architecture 760 for interference cancellation. Tracking<br>
loop(s) or estimation modules 710 refine the parameters for the reference signal<br>
generation used in the demodulation of the channel. After tracking loop(s) or estimation<br>
modules 710, the signal is de-spread by multiplying an appropriate short code spreading<br>
sequence and the phase is stripped in multiplier 720.<br>
The Walsh code of the desired channel is multiplied by a projection matrix or<br>
product of projection matrices in multiplier 730, if necessary, and is multiplied with the<br>
data signal in multiplier 740. The product of the data and the reference code is summed<br>
in summer 750 over one Walsh symbol. The demodulated data is then fed to a<br>
demodulation module, such as shown in Figure 5, element 590, where Rake receiver<br>
combining is performed when multipath signals from the same base station are being<br>
demodulated concurrently.<br>
A modified Hadamard transform module 770 is applied to the de-spread data<br>
signal. The Walsh codes used for channelization in cdmaOne are derived from a rank<br>
64 Hadamard matrix. Multiplication of the de-spread data with the appropriate row of<br>
the Hadamard matrix (Walsh symbol) and summing over one Walsh symbol effectively<br>
demodulates the corresponding channel. Hadamard transform module 770 demodulates<br>
all 64 channels in one finger. Since the processing finger may process both unprocessed<br>
data and data in which interference signal(s) have been removed, a projection matrix or<br>
product of projection matrices may have to be applied to the Walsh codes prior to<br>
multiplication with the data as indicated by element 772. Output 774 of this module is<br>
the signal amplitude of each channel. It is referred to as relative channel amplitude 774<br>
in order to emphasize that it is not necessary to know the absolute signal amplitude for<br>
the CSPE, but instead the relative amplitude between channels in the same finger is<br>
sufficient.<br><br>
The generation of S module 780 has a lot of flexibility in terms of its<br>
implementation. The channels to be canceled from the data signal may be pre-set as a<br>
fixed-size subset of channels or the complete set of channels or it may be dynamically<br>
determined from the relative channel amplitude output from Hadamard transform<br>
module 770 or another criteria. For example, a threshold may be set, such that all<br>
channels above this particular threshold are selected or a fixed number of channels may<br>
be chosen such that those channels with the greatest power are selected to be included in<br>
the generation of the S matrix. A control module, such as shown in Figure 5, element<br>
530, also determines which method of cancellation is to be used, i.e., sign information,<br>
relative power information for the composite method, no information, or the<br>
cancellation method may be fixed by the architecture. Reference signals are generated<br>
and used as vectors in the construction of the S matrix. If the input data is processed<br>
data, then a projection matrix or product of projection matrices 772 may be applied to<br>
the reference signals. The output of module 780 is the S matrix and the projection<br>
operator constructed from S that projects a signal onto a subspace orthogonal to the<br>
subspace of S. Module 790 applies the new projection operator (denoted by '*') to the<br>
data signal. Processing finger 700 feeds the new projection operator and the processed<br>
data y(1) to a control module, such as shown in Figure 5, element 530.<br>
In Figure 8, a modified Hadamard Transform module 800 (such as that shown in<br>
Figure 7, element 770) is discussed in greater detail. The input y is split into 64 paths in<br>
order to correlate it with the 64 Walsh symbols and calculate an estimate of each<br>
channel's amplitude. The 64 Walsh symbols are multiplied by the appropriate<br>
projection matrix or product of projection matrices, if necessary. For example, see 801,<br>
811 and 821. The result is then multiplied with y in respective multipliers 802, 812 and<br>
822 and summed over a Walsh symbol in respective summers 803, 813 and 823. The<br>
estimate of each channel's amplitude, which is output, may be incorrect by a scale<br>
factor, but the relative amplitude between channels is correct.<br><br>
Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12 depict several examples of the generation of an S<br>
matrix. Figure 9 depicts the generation of S matrix 900 using no information of bits<br>
transmitted or relative signal amplitude. Each channel has a selector (901, 911 and 921)<br>
that determines which Walsh symbols (channels) will be removed from the data signal.<br>
If the data, has been processed, i.e., has had interference signals removed, then the<br>
appropriate projection matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to each Walsh<br>
symbol by the respective multipliers 902, 912 and 922. The reference vector output<br>
from each selected channel is included as a vector in interference matrix S 930. The<br>
ordering of the vectors does not matter.<br>
Figure 10 depicts the generation of S matrix 1000 using sign (bit) information<br>
from each channel. Each channel has a selector (1001, 1011 and 1021) that determines<br>
which Walsh symbols will be removed from the data signal. If the data has been<br>
processed then the appropriate projection matrix or product of projection matrices is<br>
applied to each Walsh symbol by respective multipliers 1002, 1012 and 1022. Relative<br>
amplitude information is processed by a module (1003, 1013 and 1023) in each channel<br>
to determine the sign of the bit transmitted. The sign information is multiplied in<br>
respective multipliers 1004, 1014 and 1024 with the results from respective multipliers<br>
1002, 1012 and 1022. The reference vector output from each channel is included in<br>
interference matrix S 1030. The ordering of the vectors does not matter.<br>
Figure 11 depicts the generation of S matrix 1100 using relative amplitude<br>
information from each channel in order to use the composite method of cancellation.<br>
Each channel has a respective selector (1101, 1111 and 1121) that determines which<br>
Walsh symbols will be removed from the data signal. If the data has been processed<br>
then the appropriate projection matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to<br>
each Walsh symbol by the respective multiplier 1102, 1112 and 1122. Relative<br>
amplitude information is used to scale the result in each channel by the appropriate<br>
amount with the respective multipliers 1103, 1113 and 1123. The reference vector<br>
output from each channel is added together to form a composite vector in adder 1130.<br>
The resulting composite reference vector is included in interference matrix S 1140.<br><br>
Figures 12A and 12B depict two examples of the generation of an S matrix, in<br>
which a combination of the above-described methods are utilized. Figure 12A shows a<br>
combination of using no information of bits transmitted or relative signal amplitude and<br>
the composite method and Figure 12B shows a combination of using relative amplitude<br>
information and the composite method.<br>
In Figure 12A, each channel has a respective selector 1201, 1211 and 1221 that<br>
determines which Walsh symbol will be removed from the data signal without using bit<br>
or relative amplitude information. If the data has been processed then the appropriate<br>
projection matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to each Walsh symbol by<br>
respective multiplier 1202, 1212 and 1222. The reference vectors output from each<br>
channel is included in the interference matrix S. Similarly, selectors 1206, 1216 and<br>
1226 determine which Walsh symbols will be removed from the data signal using<br>
relative amplitude information and the composite method. If the data has been<br>
processed then the appropriate projection matrix or product of projection matrices is<br>
applied to each Walsh symbol by respective multiplier 1207, 1217 and 1227. Relative<br>
amplitude information is used to scale each reference vector appropriately by respective<br>
multiplier 1208, 1218 and 1228. The reference vector output from each channel is<br>
summed together by summer 1230 to form a composite vector that is included in<br>
interference matrix S 1235. The ordering of the vectors in the S matrix does not matter.<br>
In Figure 12B, each channel has a respective selector 1251, 1261 and 1271 that<br>
determines which Walsh symbol will be removed from the data signal using sign<br>
information. If the data has been processed then the appropriate projection matrix or<br>
product of projection matrices is applied to each Walsh symbol by respective multiplier<br>
1252, 1262 and 1272. Relative amplitude information is processed by respective<br>
modules 1253, 1263 and 1273 in each channel to determine the sign of the bit<br>
transmitted. The sign information is multiplied by respective multipliers 1254, 1264<br>
and 1274 with the results from multipliers 1252, 1262 and 1272. The reference vector<br>
output from each channel is included in interference matrix S 1285. Similarly,<br><br>
respective selectors 1256, 1266 and 1276 determine which Walsh symbols will be<br>
removed from the data signal using the relative amplitude information and the<br>
composite method. If the data has been processed then the appropriate projection matrix<br>
or product of projection matrices is applied to each Walsh symbol by respective<br>
multipliers 1257, 1267 and 1277. Relative amplitude information is used to scale each<br>
reference vector appropriately by respective multipliers 1258, 1268 and 1278. The<br>
reference vector output from each channel is summed together to form a composite<br>
vector by summer 1280. This composite vector is included in interference matrix S<br>
1285. The ordering of the vectors does not matter.<br>
Example II<br>
The following embodiment is of the cdma2000 forward link receiver.<br>
Modifications have to be made to the cdmaOne embodiment to accommodate features<br>
and enhancements made in cdma2000. Quasi-orthogonal (QOF) and concatenated<br>
functions may be used to achieve a smaller impact on the number of orthogonal codes<br>
available for traffic channels. Variable length Walsh codes are also used to attain higher<br>
data rates. Specifically, shorter Walsh codes down to 4 chips in length are used to<br>
increase the data rate. The limitation on Walsh codes is a length limit of 128 for IX<br>
rates and 256 for 3X rates, except for the auxiliary pilot and auxiliary transmit diversity<br>
pilot channels.<br>
Due to the varying lengths of the Walsh codes it will become increasingly<br>
important to have bit or relative amplitude information to facilitate interference<br>
cancellation. If the interference matrix contains non-pilot interference vectors<br>
composed of different length Walsh codes, it becomes imperative that the vectors of<br>
shorter length Walsh codes use either bit or relative amplitude information in order to<br>
correctly cancel interference. For information bearing channels, it is necessary for no<br>
Walsh symbol boundaries to appear in the interference matrix if no bit or relative<br>
amplitude information is used. The benefit of canceling over a single Walsh symbol is<br>
that it is not necessary to know bit or relative amplitude information. However, it may<br><br>
not be feasible to cancel interference over only 4 chip symbols or if there is symbol<br>
misalignment since a longer data record may provide better cancellation properties.<br>
Cross-correlation will have to be accounted for when a mix of QOFs and<br>
variable length Walsh codes are used for channelization. While the goal is to minimize<br>
the cross-correlation between QOFs and variable length Walsh codes, the codes are not<br>
truly orthogonal and there exists a nonzero correlation. Even with perfect time<br>
alignment, QOFs are not orthogonal to the original Walsh code set. Within a QOF set,<br>
orthogonality is preserved, but there is a cross-correlation between code vectors from<br>
different sets. A critical difference is that when QOFs are used, channels within the<br>
same finger may no longer be orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the present invention<br>
may be applied to cancellation of channels within one finger.<br>
Moreover, cdma2000 may use orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) to mitigate<br>
multipath effects. OTD splits the transmitted symbols into two paths where each path is<br>
spread by a different Walsh code or quasi-orthogonal function associated with each<br>
antenna. As a result, the receiver architecture depicts the separation of the I and Q<br>
channels to accommodate the application of different Walsh codes, if necessary.<br>
Moreover, it emphasizes the construction of separate interference matrices for the I and<br>
Q channels for cancellation purposes.<br>
The cdma2000 serial CSPE receiver incorporates the coded signal-processing<br>
engine (CSPE) into a cdma2000 receiver architecture in which interference cancellation<br>
is performed in a serial manner. Specifically, interference cancellation operations of<br>
single fingers, e.g., one or more channels from a LOS or multipath signal, are performed<br>
in a serial, or cascading, manner, typically ordered in terms of power from highest to<br>
lowest. Each processing finger may operate on the received data y or on processed data<br>
in which one or more interference signals have been cancelled. The benefit of this serial<br>
approach is that a serial receiver processing finger may track and demodulate a signal<br>
that may otherwise be buried beneath the interference and be undetectable to a baseline<br>
receiver. A master control module controls data flow and control signals for all<br><br>
processing fingers. Depending on the power of the signals that are to be acquired, the<br>
CSPE may or may not cancel the interference of the previous signal(s).<br>
As discussed above, Figure 5 depicts a forward link receiver 500. Forward link<br>
receiver 500 architecture is applicable to both cdmaOne and cdma2000. An RF signal<br>
received by the antenna is down-converted in 510 from RF to base-band (BB) based on<br>
the nominal carrier frequency. The present embodiment encompasses receivers that<br>
process base-band or IF signals. The base-band signal is then sampled in 520 to create a<br>
digital signal. The I and Q channels are not shown explicitly, but are implicit in all the<br>
data connections in the figure. Control module 530 feeds the digital signal into searcher<br>
540, which acquires the strongest signal finger and communicates the short code offset<br>
and possibly the Doppler frequency and/or phase to control module 530. Searcher 540<br>
continues to search over the code offsets in order to acquire another signal. Control<br>
module 530 feeds the data and acquisition information into one of the four processing<br>
fingers 550, 560, 570 and 580. While Figure 5 depicts four processing fingers, the<br>
present embodiment is not limited to a specific number of processing fingers but instead<br>
applies to an arbitrary number of fingers.<br>
Without loss of generality, suppose that the finger is assigned to finger processor<br>
550. The finger processor tracks the finger, demodulates the signal, creates interference<br>
matrices to cancel the signal and finally removes the signal from the input data signal.<br>
The demodulated signal is fed to demodulation module 590 that performs the Rake<br>
receiver combining as needed for multipath signals. The interference matrices and<br>
processed data are fed back to control module 530.<br>
With information from searcher 540 and the neighbor list from the finger tracked<br>
in processing finger 550, control module 530 will decide whether to track a multipath<br>
associated with the finger currently tracked in processing finger 550 or another base<br>
station. Control module 530 has searcher 540 search over the code offsets for other<br>
strong signals in either the received data or in the data with the interfering finger<br>
removed. The latter is done if the interference from the first signal is too strong to<br><br>
detect or adequately track another signal. Without loss of generality, the second finger<br>
is fed to finger processor 560 with data that has the strong signal removed. The signal is<br>
tracked, demodulated, interference matrices are created and the signal is removed from<br>
the input data signal. Thus, the resulting signal has the first two tracked signals<br>
removed from it in a serial manner, i.e., successive cancellations.<br>
The process continues in a similar manner for the other finger processors.<br>
Searcher 540 may search the received data or data in which interference signal(s) have<br>
been removed in a serial manner. Multipath signals corresponding to the same base<br>
station are combined in a Rake receiver in module 590.<br>
In Figure 13, searcher 1300 (such as that shown in Figure 5, element 540) is<br>
discussed in greater detail. The pilot Walsh code is multiplied by the short code by<br>
respective multipliers 1301 and 1311. If the input data y has had interference signals<br>
removed, then the products of the multiplications in multipliers 1301 and 1311 are<br>
multiplied by the corresponding projection matrices in the respective multipliers 1303<br>
and 1313. The reference signals computed by multipliers 1303 and 1313 are multiplied<br>
in the respective multipliers 1305 and 1315 with the respective input data signals, y1 and<br>
VQ. The correlation procedure is completed by summing the products of the land Q<br>
channels with the reference signals over a correlation length (N chips) by respective<br>
summers 1307 and 1317. The short code multiplied in multiplication blocks 1301 and<br>
1311 are chosen such that the reference signal checks all possible code offsets.<br>
Comparator 1309 uses standard methods to select the strongest signal. However,<br>
if a processing finger is already tracking a signal, then that signal will not be reacquired.<br>
Moreover, if the receiver has enough signals (LOS and/or multipath signals) from one<br>
base station, the searcher may be instructed to not acquire any more multipath signals<br>
from the same base station. Depending on the searching algorithm, the control module<br>
may provide the searcher with either an unprocessed signal or one in which interference<br>
signal(s) have been removed.<br><br>
In Figure 14, a processing finger 1400 (such as that shown in Figure 5, element<br>
550) is discussed in greater detail. The parameters of the input signals yI and VQ are<br>
further refined in tracking loop(s) or parameter estimation module(s) 1410. Tracking<br>
loop(s) or estimation module(s) 1410 may include a DLL or code offset estimation, a<br>
PLL or phase estimation and/or an FLL or frequency estimation. At this point, this<br>
embodiment of the present invention differs from the standard baseline cdma2000<br>
receiver architecture. The data flow is split between the architecture for signal<br>
demodulation and the CSPE architecture for interference cancellation in blocks 1440<br>
and 1450.<br>
Tracking loop(s) or parameter estimation module(s) 1410 refine the parameters<br>
for the reference signal generation used in the demodulation of the channel. After 1410,<br>
the signals are de-spread by the appropriate short code spreading sequence by respective<br>
multipliers 1401 and 1421. The Walsh code, concatenated Walsh code or quasi-<br>
orthogonal function (QOF) of the desired channel is multiplied by a projection matrix or<br>
product of projection matrices by respective multipliers 1403 and 1423, if necessary,<br>
and is then multiplied with the I and Q data signals by respective multipliers 1405 and<br>
1425. The product of the data and the reference codes is summed by respective<br>
summers 1407 and 1427 over one Walsh or QOF symbol. The demodulated data is then<br>
fed to a demodulation module, such as shown in Figure 5, element 590, where Rake<br>
receiver combining is performed when multipath signals from the same base station are<br>
demodulated.<br>
Amplitude estimator modules 1409 and 1429 are applied to the de-spread I and<br>
Q data signals. Variable length Walsh codes and QOFs are used for channelization in<br>
cdma2000. Walsh codes and QOFs are derived from an orthogonal Hadamard matrix.<br>
Multiplication of the de-spread data with the appropriate symbol and summing over a<br>
symbol length effectively demodulates the corresponding channel. The amplitude<br>
estimator demodulates all channels in one finger. Since the processing finger may<br>
process both unprocessed data and data in which interference signal(s) have been<br>
removed, a projection matrix or product of projection matrices may have to be applied<br><br>
to the symbols prior to multiplication with the data. The output of this module is the<br>
signal amplitude of each channel. It is referred to as relative channel amplitude in order<br>
to emphasize that it is not necessary to know the absolute signal amplitude for the<br>
CSPE, but instead the relative amplitude between channels in the same finger is<br>
sufficient.<br>
The generation of S, modules 1411 and 1431, have a lot of flexibility in terms of<br>
their implementation. The channels to be canceled from the data signal can be pre-set as<br>
a fixed-size subset of channels or the complete set of channels or it may be dynamically<br>
determined from the relative channel amplitude output from the amplitude estimator<br>
modules 1409 and 1429. For example, a threshold may be set, such that all channels<br>
above this particular threshold are selected or a fixed number of channels may be chosen<br>
such that those with the greatest power are selected to be included in the generation of<br>
the S matrix. The control module also determines which method of cancellation is to be<br>
used, i.e., sign information, relative power information for the composite method or no<br>
information, or it may be fixed in the architecture. Reference signals are generated and<br>
used as vectors in the construction of the S matrices. If the input data is processed data,<br>
then a projection matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to each of the<br>
reference signals. The output of modules 1411 and 1431 is the S matrix and the<br>
projection operator constructed from the S matrices that project the signals onto a<br>
subspace orthogonal to the subspace of each of the S matrices respectively. Modules<br>
1413 and 1433 apply the new projection operators (denoted by '*') to the data signals.<br>
The processing finger feeds the new projection operators and the processed data y/1} and<br>
VQ(1) to the control module.<br>
In Figure 15, amplitude estimator modules 1500 and 1550 (such as those shown<br>
in Figure 14, elements 1409 and 1429) are discussed. The input data yI and VQ are<br>
considered separately and are correlated with Walsh and QOF symbols in order to<br>
calculate an estimate of each channel's amplitude. In the figure, the symbols are<br>
denoted by Wj, which represents variable length Walsh codes and QOF symbols. The<br>
symbols are multiplied by the appropriate projection matrix or product of projection<br><br>
matrices, if necessary. For example, see respective multipliers 1501, 1511, 1551 and<br>
1561. The result is then multiplied with yi by respective multipliers 1503 and 1513 and<br>
with VQ by respective multipliers 1553 and 1563 and then summed over the symbol<br>
length in respective summers 1505, 1515, 1555 and 1565. The estimate of each<br>
channel's amplitude, which is output by the modules 1500 and 1550, may be off by a<br>
scale factor, but the correct relative amplitude between channels is all that is necessary.<br>
Figures 16A, 16B, 17A, 17B, 18A and 18B depict several examples of<br>
'generation of S' modules. Figures 16A and 16B depict the generation of S matrix<br>
modules 1600 and 1650 that use no information of bits transmitted or relative signal<br>
amplitude. Each channel has a respective selector 1601, 1611, 1651 and 1661 that<br>
determines which symbols (channels) will be removed from the data signal. If the data<br>
has been processed, i.e., has had interference signals removed, then the appropriate<br>
projection matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to each symbol by<br>
respective multipliers 1603, 1613, 1653 and 1663. The reference vector output from<br>
each selected channel is included as a vector in the interference matrices Si and SQ, 1620<br>
and 1670, respectively. The ordering of the vectors in the S matrices does not matter.<br>
Figures 17A and 17B depict generation of S matrix modules 1700 and 1750<br>
using sign (bit) information from each channel. Each channel has a respective selector<br>
1701, 1711, 1751 and 1761 that determines which symbols (channels) will be removed<br>
from the data signals. If the data has been processed then the appropriate projection<br>
matrix or product of projection matrices is applied to each symbol by respective<br>
multipliers 1703,1713,1753 and 1763. Relative amplitude information is processed by<br>
a respective amplitude module 1705,1715,1755 and 1765 in each channel to determine<br>
the sign of the bit transmitted. The sign information multiplies the symbols in<br>
respective multipliers 1707, 1717, 1757 and 1767. The reference vector output from<br>
each channel is included in the interference matrices Si and SQ, 1720 and 1770,<br>
respectively. The ordering of the vectors does not matter.<br><br>
Figures 18A and 18B depict generation of S matrix modules 1800 and 1850<br>
using relative amplitude information from each channel in order to use the composite<br>
method of cancellation. Each channel has a respective selector 1801, 1811, 1851 and<br>
1861 that determines which symbols will be removed from the data signals. If the data<br>
has been processed then the appropriate projection matrix or product of projection<br>
matrices is applied to each symbol by respective multipliers 1803,1813,1853 and 1863.<br>
Relative amplitude information is used to scale the result in each channel by respective<br>
multipliers 1805, 1815, 1855 and 1865 by an appropriate amount. The reference vector<br>
output from each channel is added together to form a composite vector by respective<br>
adders 1820 and 1870 for the I and Q channels respectively. The resulting composite<br>
reference vectors are used to construct the SI and SQ interference matrices, 1830 and<br>
1880, respectively.<br>
The methods for constructing S matrices may be combined in the manner of<br>
Figure 12, provided for the cdmaOne embodiment, for example, by combining the<br>
composite method with either the method using bit information or the method using<br>
neither bit nor relative signal amplitude.<br>
The methods and apparatus of the present invention may be applied to other<br>
CDMA communication embodiments, e.g., WCDMA. Moreover, the present invention<br>
may be applied to global positioning systems, radar and optics.<br>
