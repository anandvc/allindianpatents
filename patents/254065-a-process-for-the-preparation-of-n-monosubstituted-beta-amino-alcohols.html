The invention relates to a process for the preparation of  N- monosubstituted β-amino alcohols of formula<br><br>
and/or an addition salt of a proton acid.<br>
N-Monosubstituted β-amino alcohols of formula I like (S)-(-)-3-N-methylamino-l-(2-thienyl)-1-propanol (LY293628) are useful key intermediates and building  blocks for the preparation of pharmaceutically active compounds like (•S)-(+)-methyl-[3-(l-naphthyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)-propyl]-amine ((5)-duloxetine) (Liu, H. et al., Chirality 12 (2000) 26-29) a potential neuro-active compound which strongly inhibits the serotonine and norephedrine uptake (Deeter, J. et al., Tetrahedron Lett 31 (1990) 7101-7104).<br><br><br>
In the following the terms "amine" or 'amines" include their corresponding addition salts of proton acids.<br>
Direct preparation of N-monosubstituted β-keto amines of formula 11 establishes an alternative and economically advantageous source for industrial production of N-monosubstituted β-amino alcohols of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula II were first synthesized in 1922 by reacting ketones with formaldehyde and primary or secondary alkylamines in the presence of hydrochloric acid (Mannich, C. et al., Chem. Ber 55 (1922) 356-365). In said reactions with primary alkylamines formation of hydrochlorides of tertiary β-keto amines of formula<br><br>
prevails over formation of hydrochlorides of secondary β-keto amines of formula II. These findings were supported by Blicke et al. (X Am. Chem, Soc. 64 (1942) 4S1-454) and Becker et al. {Wiss. Z Tech Hochsck Chem. Lema-Merseburg. 11 (1969) 38-41).<br>
According to Mannich et al. steam destination of tertiary β-keto amines of formula III results in formation of secondary β-keto amines of formula II in fairly satisfactory yields, accompanied by vinyl compounds and other by-products.<br>
Also from Blicke, F.F., Organic reactions, vol. 1, Chapter 10, The Mannich Reaction, 1942, 303-341 is known that the mannich reaction using primary amines leads to many side products. Nobles, L.W. et al., J.Am. Pharm, Assoc, Sci.Ed., 67, 1958, 77-81 disclose among many compounds according to the compounds of formula II having a N, N-disubstituted amino group only one compound having a benzylamino group which is obtained in low yield.<br>
Another drawback in presently known preparation methods of β-keto amines is the need of isolation of the desired intermediate compounds of formula II from unwanted by-products of formula III.<br>
Eβ-A 457 559 and Eβ-A 650 965 disclose the preparation of N,N-dimethyl β-amino alcohols via Mannich-type reactions of methyl ketones with paraformaldehyde and dimethylamine<br><br>
followed by reduction of the carbonyl group. After reaction of the hydroxyl group affording alkyl or aryi ether derivatives one methyl radical is removed to obtain N=monosubstituted compounds which requires delicate and expensive reactions.<br>
Only Becker et al. disclose some few examples with yields of about 60% of N--monomethyl β-keto amines using N-methylammonium oxalates as nitrogen source. Nevertheless, the process disclosed by Becker et al. is not advantageous because it strictly depends on the use of amino oxalates. In contrast to the free amines or conesponding hydrochlorides oxalates of primary amines are not commercially available and their preparation requires further synthesis and purification steps.<br>
Using oxalates is also disadvantageous because it requires additional reduction equivalents in the next step, reducing the ketone intermediates to the title compounds.<br>
None of the known processes for the production of N-monosubstituted β-amino alcohols of formula I and ether derivatives thereof includes, intends or concerns intermediate products comparable to N-monosubstituted β-keto amines of formula II of the present invention. Although still many efforts were made to find new preparation processes, the pathway of the present invention for direct synthesis of N-monosubstituted β-keto amines and subsequent reduction to N-monosubstituted β-amino alcohols is not yet disclosed.<br>
The problem to be solved was to provide ian alternative and efficient process for the synthesis of A^-monosubstituted β-amino alcohols and derivatives thereof in high yields. Furthermore, the proposed process should provide high yields independently of steric aspects of the used amino or carbonyl compoimds.<br>
The problems mentioned above could be solved according to claim 1.<br>
Starting with commercially available methyl ketones and primary amines and/or an addition salt of a proton acid, which were reacted with formaldehyde in the presence a solvent and optionally of a proton acid at a pressure above 1,5 bar N-monosubstituted β- keto amines<br><br>
which could be directly reduced to the desired N-monosubstituted β-amino alcohols were obtained in high yields.<br>
As a further advantage of the instant process high yields of N-monomethyl β- keto amines can be obtained by direct usage of methylamine hydrochloride which is easily available, cheap and, since it is a solid compound, easy to handle.<br>
The present invention discloses a process for the preparation of a compound of formula<br><br>
