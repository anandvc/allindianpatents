[TITLE OF THE INVENTION] FERE EXTINGUISHER GAS EJECTOR<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention is suitable for a fire extinguisher gas ejector. This<br>
invention relates to an fire extinguisher gas ejector comprises a safety member which is<br>
taken out easily and promptly so that a seal of a loaded small gas cylinder is quickly pierced,<br>
jet an extinguishing gas promptly, and attempt an early fire extinction. The invention also<br>
comprises an emergency escape mechanism from vehicle, which cuts a seat belt promptly<br>
and breaks a windshield surely in case such as a fire in vehicle or collision, to attempt<br>
escape promptly from vehicle. Thus, a device exclusive to escape is unnecessary.<br>
Mechanisms for fire extinguishing and escaping are constituted rationally. The invention<br>
also comprises a control valve which prevents a waste of the extinguishing gas after the seal<br>
is pierced and jets the fire extinguishing gas to a fire origin surely and accurately in fire<br>
fighting.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
Popular fire extinguishers placed at homes or offices are usually large-sized and<br>
heavy so that they require physical strength and hard to use.<br>
To solve above-mentioned problems, it is proposed that a variety of small and<br>
lightweight fire extinguishers that can be used simply.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, of the simple fire extinguishers, a gas cylinder is stored into a pipe<br>
body putting a cover thereon, a plate- shaped nozzle forming a jetting port at the lower end<br>
is attached, a pusher guide is attached on the top of the pipe body, and a pusher having a<br>
needle on the guide is attached slidably. A cylinder receiver is attached inside of the<br>
pusher guide, and a screw of the mouth part of the gas cylinder is screwed up for the<br>
receiver. Usually, a safety plate is plugged in the pusher to stop the moving.<br>
[0004]<br>
Then, the safety plate is removed when putting out a fire and hit the outside of the<br>
pusher with a hand and pushes inwardly. Then a sealing plate is pierced by the needle<br>
which moves toward the gas cylinder side. A filled gas which gushed is guided to inside<br>
of a shaft from the inside of the pipe so as to jet the gas from a jetting port which is<br>
positioned at the opposite side with the seal piercing position. (For example, see, Patent<br>
Document 1)<br>
[0005]<br>
However, the above-mentioned fire extinguisher has following problems. An<br>
operation of the safety plate may be confusing when putting out a sudden fire and small<br>
grasping portion makes it difficult to pull out the safety plate. After the seal is pierced, the<br>
jetting gas is guided to a space between the pipe body and the gas cylinder. Since the gas<br>
is jetted from the jetting port which is positioned at the opposite side of the seal piercing<br>
point, it attenuates pressure, speed and an effect in fire fighting, making initial fire fighting<br>
incomplete. Moreover, the jetting gas remains inside of the pipe body after the seal<br>
piercing so that some amount of gas remains unused in the pipe body.<br>
[0006]<br>
On the other hand, the conventional simple fire extinguishers are usually placed at<br>
homes or offices, however, the demands to place them in vehicles is on the rise to cope with<br>
a fire in vehicles nowadays .<br>
In such cases, it is to be desired for a simple fire extinguisher used in vehicle to<br>
combine other functions rationally in addition to the function of a fire extinguisher.<br>
[0007]<br>
Due to such demands recently, a car is equipped with an emergency escape device<br>
so as to be able to escape from a car in case of an emergency, such as collision.<br>
The escape equipment is formed in shape of bar and is provided with a cutter for<br>
cutting a seat belt at one end. A hammer capable of breaking a windshield is provided at<br>
the other end or the end and set it in a holder. It is installed around a driver's seat or an<br>
appropriate place in a car to prepare for an emergency. (For example, see, patent<br>
document 2 and 3)<br>
[0008]<br>
Of them, one emergency escape device is difficult to correspond to emergency use<br>
because a cutter has to be extracted from its storage handle. Other emergency escape<br>
device has following problem. The cutter is arranged with the edge fixed downwardly in a<br>
generally V-shaped groove between a periphery of a body and a guide which protrudes<br>
toward a head part of the body. When cutting a seat belt, a side of the seat belt connects<br>
the edge of the cutter at generally right angles. Therefore, the seat belt cannot be cut<br>
promptly and smoothly.<br>

[DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED]<br>
[0010]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the mentioned problem and provide<br>
a fire extinguisher gas ejector which is suitable for a fire extinguisher used in car. This<br>
invention provides a fire extinguisher gas ejector which easily and quickly removes the<br>
safety member and pierce the seal of the charged small gas cylinder and jet the gas properly<br>
and attempt early fire extinction. This invention comprises the emergency escape<br>
mechanism from vehicle, which cuts a seat belt promptly and breaks the windshield surely<br>
such as a fire in vehicle and collision, and attempts a prompt escape from vehicle.<br>
Moreover, it does not require a device exclusive to escape. Mechanisms for both fire<br>
extinction and escaping are rationally constituted. The hammer can rationally and safely<br>
be attached to the gas cylinder. The invention has the control valve which prevents a<br>
waste of the extinguishing gas and jets the fire extinguishing gas to an origin of a fire surely<br>
and accurately in fire fighting.<br>

valve. The control valve stops emitting the extinguishing gas from the gas cylinder after<br>
the seal is pierced. In addition, it prevents a waste of extinguishing gas and enables to jet<br>
the gas to an origin of a fire accurately. Therefore, effective use of the extinguishing gas<br>
and initial fire fighting can be achieved. Moreover, the structure is simplified by reducing<br>
the number of the parts so that small and lightweight fire extinguisher gas ejector can be<br>
produced easily and at low cost.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the present invention of claim 2, the through hole has a small-caliber valve hole<br>
and the valve hole is slidably provided with the control valve. The gas cylinder is<br>
structured rationally to attempt to reduce a number of parts and to make a structure of the<br>
control valve simpler. Thus, it is produced easily and at a low cost.<br>
In the present invention of claim 3, the control valve has a periphery on which at<br>
least two O-rings are mounted apart from each other, the valve hole is air-tightened with<br>
one of the O-rings, before or when the seal is pierced by the piercing pipe, and either one of<br>
the O-rings is positioned at an inner opening of the nozzle hole to be able to close the nozzle<br>
hole, thereby making the constitution of the control valve simpler. The extinguishing gas<br>
which jets from the nozzle hole before/ when piercing the seal is prevented and a waste of<br>
the extinguishing gas is stopped.<br>
In the present invention of claim 4, the piercing pipe is returned to an original<br>
position under pressure of the extinguishing gas jetted from the gas cylinder, and one of the<br>
O-ring is positioned at the inner opening of the nozzle hole to be able to close the nozzle<br>
hole. Then, after the seal is pierced, the extinguishing gas which unconsciously jet can be<br>
stopped and a waste of the extinguishing gas is prevented.<br>
[0013]<br>
In the present invention of claim 5, the extinguishing gas jetted from the gas<br>
cylinder is able to stagnate in the through hole after the seal is pierced, thereby preventing a<br>
waste of the extinguishing gas.<br>
In the present invention of claim 6, the closed nozzle hole is unclosed with one of<br>
the O-rings by an operation of the piercing pipe after the seal is pierced, thereby allowing<br>
the extinguishing gas to be jetted from the nozzle hole. After the seal is pierced, when the<br>
piercing pipe is pressed with the piercing member, the extinguishing gas is jetted.<br>
In the present invention of claim 7, the piercing pipe has a lower part exhibiting a<br>
less descending displacement after the seal is pierced than when the seal is pierced. When<br>
the piercing member is operated after the piercing, the tip part of the piercing pipe is<br>
inserted to the opening of the sealing plate to prevent a situation which interferes a smooth<br>
jetting of the extinguishing gas.<br>
In the present invention of claim 8, the safety member is arranged just below the<br>
piercing member to be able to be pulled out laterally, and the safety member which is<br>
formed integrally with a tab is arranged on the piercing member to be able to be pulled up.<br>

[BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
[0042]<br>
The following is description of illustrated embodiments that this invention is<br>
applied to a fire extinguisher gas ejector for in-car use which uses a cartridge gas cylinder.<br>
In Fig. 1 to 14, reference numeral 1 represents a known and small gas cylinder which is<br>
charged with carbon dioxide as an extinguishing gas. A mouth part of the gas cylinder 1 is<br>
provided with a piercing device 2.<br>
The gas cylinder 1 of the embodiment requires about 40 mm in external diameter,<br>
about 130 mm in length, and about 90 ml in tare weight and is charged with carbon dioxide<br>
of about 4MPa therein. The weight after charging is about 300g. After charging the gas,<br>
the mouth part is sealed with the sealing plate 3 and a hammer, which is described later, is<br>
attached to a bottom.<br>
[0043]<br>
A thread part 4 is formed on a periphery of the mouth part for the gas cylinder 1<br>
and is screwed to the piercing device 2 to be fixed.<br>
The seal piercing device 2 is formed in a shape of an irregular tubular with strong<br>
and light synthetic resin. The seal piercing device 2 is composed of double pipes. One is<br>
a cylinder holder 5 which has a lower end capable of screwing the thread part 4. The other<br>
is an outer pipe 6, outer shell, which has a hollow tubular shape and is arranged outside of<br>
the cylinder holder 5.<br>
[0044]<br>
Of them, the cylinder holder 5 is formed in shape of virtually cylindrical with<br>
aluminum and has a screw hole 7 at the lower end capable of screwing the thread part 4.<br>
The cylinder holder 5 has a through hole 8 which communicates with the screw hole 7 and a<br>
hole 9 which is a little smaller than the through hole 8 therein to communicate each other in<br>
the coaxial direction. The seal piercing pipe 10, which will be described later, is inserted<br>
slidably the through hole 8 and the hole 9.<br>
In the illustration, reference numerals 11 and 12 represent O-rings. The O-ring 11<br>
is inserted in a step of dividing part between the through hole 8 and the hole 9. The O-ring<br>
12 is inserted in a annular groove between the screw hole 7 and the through hole 8.<br>
[0045]<br>
The middle to upper periphery of the cylinder holder 5 has a jetting port 13 which<br>
constitutes a jetting flow path together with the through hole 8 and a nozzle hole, which will<br>
be described later. A nozzle hole 14. which communicates with the through hole 8. is<br>
formed in the inner part of the jetting port 13.<br>
A pair of positioning pins 15 is protruded from the outer periphery of the cylinder<br>
holder 5 to the diameter direction and the pins 15 are fitted to the pin holes that are formed<br>
on inner surfaces of outer pipe pieces, which will be described later. Outer pipe pieces 6a,<br>
6b are connected to predetermined positions to prevent dislocation of guide holes 31a, 31b,<br>
connecting surfaces 38a, 38b, and recessed grooves 38a, 38b.<br>
In embodiment, a pair of recess holes 16 are formed at the positions of 90 degree<br>
from the jetting port 13 on the periphery of the cylinder holder 5. The positioning pins 15<br>
are pressed in the recess holes 16 and the ends are protruded from the periphery.<br>
[0046]<br>
The piercing pipe 10 is formed in a shape of bar by processing aluminum bar.<br>
The upper half of the piercing pipe 10 is slidably inserted to the hole 9 and a large-diameter<br>
part 10a is formed on the middle part. The large-diameter part 10a is slidably inserted to<br>
the through hole 8. In drawings, reference numeral 17 is an annular groove formed on the<br>
large-diameter part 10a. Reference numeral 18, which is an O-ring, is attached to the<br>
annular groove 17.<br>
[0047)<br>
A needle tube 19, which is made of steel tube, is fixed to the lower end of the seal<br>
piercing pipe 10 and the end of 19 is diagonally cut permitting the tip part 19a to pierce the<br>
sealing plate 3.<br>
In this case, without providing the seal piercing pipe 10 and the needle tube 19<br>
separately, these parts can be integrally constituted. Then, a number of parts are reduced<br>
and the structure becomes simpler. Accordingly, the piercing pipe 10 only has to be<br>
equipped with the tip part 19a at one end.<br>
In drawings, reference numeral 20 represents a spring which is inserted between<br>
the end of the piercing pipe 10 and the sealing plate 3, and biased the piercing pipe 10 to<br>
move upwardly with the resilience.<br>
[0048]<br>
The piercing pipe 10 has a contracted square shank 21 at upper end. The square<br>
shank 21 is fitted to a square hole 22a which is formed on the bottom surface of a seal<br>
piercing knob 22, which is the seal piercing member, and they are fixed together by using<br>
adhesive. In this case, instead of using adhesive on the square shank 21 and the square<br>
hole 22a, it is possible to fix them by screwing from the top of the seal piercing knob 22 or<br>
using a retaining ring.<br>
[0049]<br>
The seal piercing knob 22 is formed in a shape of virtually elliptical plate with<br>
synthetic resins, on which the top surface is gently recessed so as to be able to put a finger.<br>
A chevron-shaped rib 23 is projected on the front peripheral edge and a knob of a tab 24 is<br>
arranged overlapped on the base side of the rib 23.<br>
The tab 24 is formed by bending the synthetic resin rod, which has the same quality<br>
as of the piercing device 2, into a shape of virtually triangular, and the knob 24a is formed<br>
by bending the apex diagonally upward.<br>
Then, the knob 24a is disposed on the middle part of top surface of the seal<br>
piercing knob 22 to be able to put the finger 25 thereon. The knob 24a can be pulled up<br>
with a connecting part 26, which protruded from back end, as a fulcrum.<br>
[0050]<br>
The connecting part 26 is formed diagonally downward, with the lower end<br>
connected to the rear end of the safety plate 27.<br>
The safety plate 27 is formed with the same member as the tab 24 and is shaped in<br>
an elliptical plate which is little larger than the tab 24.<br>
[0051]<br>
The notch 28 is formed in the front-back direction on the half front of a safety plate<br>
27, and a notch 28 is engaged with upper part of the seal piercing pipe 10.<br>
Specifically, the safety plate 27 is usually inserted between the seal piercing knob<br>
22 and the upper surface of the outer pipe 6. The piercing pipe 10 is engaged with the<br>
notch 28 to prevent pulling out the safety plate 27 and pressing the seal piercing tab 24.<br>
When the tab 24 is raised and pulled up, the safety plate 27 can be pulled backwardly along<br>
the notch 28.<br>
[0052]<br>
On the other hand, the outer pipe 6 is constituted with two pieces that are split in<br>
the axial direction along a jetting port guide, which will be described later, and the cylinder<br>
holder 5 is stored therein. Connecting surfaces 29a, 29b, are integrally attached as one<br>
with heat welding. In such a case, the outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b can be joined together by<br>
screwing or using adhesive instead of heat welding.<br>
[0053]<br>
Irregular-shaped engaging holes 30a, 30b capable of storing the cylinder holder 5<br>
are symmetrically formed on the connecting surfaces 29a, 29b of the outer pipe pieces 6a,<br>
6b. One side of the connecting surfaces 29a, 29b have guide holes 31a, 32b that constitute<br>
a funnel-like jetting port guide 31.<br>
In illustrations, reference numerals 32a, 32b represent pin holes that are formed on<br>
the inner surfaces of the engaging holes 30a, 30b permitting the positioning pin 15, 15 to be<br>
inserted.<br>
[0054]<br>
A chevron-shaped protrusion 33 is formed in the axial direction on the back<br>
periphery of the outer pipe 6. and a seat belt guide 34 is protruded outside of the protrusion<br>
33 obliquely downward from the upper end of the outer pipe 6, virtually parallel with the<br>
protrusion 33.<br>
A seat belt introduction groove 36 capable of inserting a seat belt 35 is formed<br>
between the seat belt guide 34 and the protrusion 33, facing the inner surface of the<br>
introduction groove 36 each other.<br>
A cutter 37 is arranged at upper part of the introduction groove 36. An edge of<br>
the cutter 37a is vertically arranged, and acutely arranged with respect to the direction of<br>
introducing the seat belt 35. The seat belt 35 can be cut at sharp angle with respect to a<br>
direction of the thickness of the seat belt 35.<br>
[0055]<br>
The seat belt guide 34 is constituted by joining guide pieces 34a, 34b that extend<br>
from outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b. Concaved grooves 39a, 39b, that are virtually parallelogram<br>
shape, are formed in axial direction over the joining surfaces 38a, 38b and the connecting<br>
surfaces of 29a, 29b of the outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b. The cutter 37 is stored in the<br>
concaved groove 39a, 39b.<br>
In illustrations, a pin 40 protrudes from the recessed grooves 39a, 39b are inserted<br>
in a fitting hole 41 formed on the cutter 37 to prevent displacement.<br>
[0056]<br>
The outer pipe 6 has lower periphery on which the front and back sides are<br>
concavely curved, and the cross sectional view is an elliptical shape. Curved concaved<br>
parts 42, 43 respectively have a concave part 44 and a convex part 45 that form curved<br>
patterns for to make friction so that the part can easily or firmly grasped.<br>
The outer pipe 6 has skirt-like peripheries on lower part and the skirt-portions are<br>
arranged apart at the outside of the periphery of the shoulder part. These spaces block heat<br>
conduction which lowers a temperature of the surface of the gas cylinder 1 when the<br>
extinguishing gas is jetted. Thus, the temperature drop of the curved concaved parts 42, 43<br>
is inhibited.<br>
[0057]<br>
The gas cylinder 1 has a sheet 46 made of heat insulating film on the middle<br>
periphery with printed pictures thereon that show how to use of the fire extinguisher gas<br>
ejector. The heat insulation action is obtained when putting out a fire.<br>
In embodiment, the film made of synthetic resin is used for the sheet 46, the film is<br>
attached by shrinking with predetermined temperature on the surface of the gas cylinder 1<br>
which is filled with carbon dioxide.<br>
[0058]<br>
The hammer 47 having the pointed part is attached to the exposed bottom of the<br>
gas cylinder 1, and a hammer 47 is molded by sintering to a predetermined hardness with a<br>
prescribed powder metal.<br>
The hammer 47 is shaped in a thin, concavely or convexly curved plate capable of<br>
contacting the bottom of the gas cylinder 1. A pointed part 48, which is a cone shape, is<br>
protruded from the center of the convex surface side.<br>
[0059]<br>
After molding to the predetermined shape with sintering, the hammer 47 of the<br>
embodiment is prepared to high hardness by quenching with the predetermined temperature.<br>
The prepared hammer 47 is attached to the bottom of the gas cylinder 1, which is filled with<br>
carbon dioxide, by spot welding or welding.<br>
Accordingly, the hammer 47 can be attached to the gas cylinder 1 smoothly and<br>
safely without changing a conventional process or filling facility of carbon dioxide for the<br>
gas cylinder 1.<br>
[0060]<br>
In this case, the hammer 47 can also be attached by bonding or brazing instead of<br>
spot welding. A thick steel plate is press molded to said shape instead of molding the<br>
hammer 47 with sintering, and the hammer can also be attached by spot welding, welding,<br>
bonding, or soldering.<br>
[0061]<br>
In illustration, reference numeral 49 shows the extinguishing gas jetting for outside<br>
from the jetting port guide 31 after the seal is pierced. Reference numeral 50 shows a<br>
windshield of a car.<br>
[0062]<br>
The fire extinguisher gas ejector, which is constituted by the way above, is<br>
constructed by attaching the piercing device 2 on top of the small gas cylinder. The small<br>
gas cylinder 1 is constituted by attaching the hammer 47 for an emergency escape. The<br>
piercing device 2 is constituted with the piercing pipe 10, the piercing knob 22, the safety<br>
plate 27 which is integrally formed with the tab 24, and the cutter 37 for cutting a seat belt<br>
for escaping in case of an emergency.<br>
[0063]<br>
When making a fire extinguisher gas ejector, the hammer 47 is molded by sintering.<br>
After the sintering, the hammer 47 is prepared for predetermined hardness and is attached to<br>
the bottom of the small gas cylinder 1 by spot welding.<br>
The piercing device 2 is produced by combining following parts. The resin<br>
molded outer pipes 6a, 6b, the piercing knob 22 and the tab 24 that are respectively resin<br>
molded, and the cylinder holder 5, the piercing pipe 10, and the cutter 37 that are metal<br>
processed.<br>
[0064]<br>
Then, when making the hammer 47 firstly, prescribed powder metal is molded by<br>
sintering and shape it into concavely or convexly curved thin plate. Then, the conically<br>
shaped pointed part 48 is protruded on the center of the convex surface side.<br>
This state is shown in the Fig. 10. After the molding, the pointed part 48 is<br>
prepared for high hardness by quenching with a predetermined temperature.<br>
[0065]<br>
When attaching the hammer 47, which is produced by the way above, to the gas<br>
cylinder 1, the hammer 47 is spot welded to the gas cylinder 1 which is filled with the<br>
extinguishing gas, carbon dioxide, and sealed with the sealing plate 3.<br>
The spot welding is carried out by connecting the concavely curved surface of the<br>
hammer 47 with the bottom of the gas cylinder 1, energizing, and welding. The state is<br>
shown in the Fig. 9.<br>
[0066]<br>
In this case, the spot welding temporarily causes high temperature. However, the<br>
filled carbon dioxide has no risk for an ignition, explosion, or a sudden expansion. After<br>
the spot welding, the current state is promptly recovered so that the operation of spot<br>
welding is performed safely.<br>
Moreover, there is no risk for a deformation due to thermal stress of the spot<br>
welding or a crack due to a distortion. Therefore, the strength of the gas cylinder 1 is<br>
remained, and the state of the filled carbon dioxide remains the same.<br>
The sealing plate 3 is also sealed by spot welding after filling the carbon dioxide.<br>
This suggests that it is safe to carry out a spot welding to the gas cylinder 1.<br>
[0067]<br>
Moreover, the spot welding to the gas cylinder 1 is carried out after the carbon<br>
dioxide is filled. Therefore, filling operation of the carbon dioxide can be carried out in a<br>
conventional manner by using filling facilities that already exist. It will not reduce the<br>
productivity and the efficiency.<br>
Accordingly, decrease of safety or productivity can be avoided unlike a case in<br>
which the spot welding is carried out before filling carbon dioxide, which affects the use of<br>
the conventional facilities of filling by the spot welded hammer 47 or causes decrease of<br>
efficiency and productivity due to changes of operations.<br>
[0068]<br>
In this case, it is also possible to attach the hammer 47 to the filled gas cylinder 1<br>
by bonding or brazing instead of spot welding.<br>
Of them, bonding does not require any special facility for attachment. Little<br>
consideration needs to be given to effects of temperature of spot welding and thermal stress<br>
on the filled gas.<br>
Moreover, brazing requires lower temperature compared to spot welding. It<br>
reduces effects of temperature of brazing on filled gas and thermal stress. At the same<br>
time, similar advantages and strength can be obtained as spot welding.<br>
[0069]<br>
Meanwhile, a thick steel plate is press molded into the above-mentioned shape and<br>
it can also be attached by spot welding, bonding or brazing instead of molding the hammer<br>
47 with sintering.<br>
The way above does not require an expensive facility for sintering and molding and<br>
simple and low cost production is possible by the press molding.<br>
[0070]<br>
After the hammer 47 is attached, the sheet 46 is attached on the middle periphery<br>
of the gas cylinder 1.<br>
In the embodiment, a film made of synthetic resin is used for the sheet 46 with<br>
printed pictures that show usage of the fire extinguisher gas ejector. Then, the film is cut<br>
to a predetermined size and formed in shape of roll. The periphery of the gas cylinder 1 is<br>
covered with the sheet, and then, shift it into a heat furnace with predetermined temperature<br>
for heat contraction. The shrunk film is attached on the middle periphery of the gas<br>
cylinder 1.<br>
[0071]<br>
Next, when producing the piercing device 2, the outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b, the<br>
piercing knob 22, and the safety plate 27 are separately resin molded, the cylinder holder 5<br>
and the piercing pipe 10 are machine processed with different diameter aluminum bars, and<br>
the cutter 37 is produced by press molding the steel plate.<br>
Of them, outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b are formed by cutting axially the outer pipe 6 into<br>
half at the position of the jetting port guide 31. And the center of the connecting surfaces<br>
29a, 29b of the cylinder body side have the engaging holes 30a, 30b and the engaging holes<br>
30a, 30b have the pin holes 32a, 32b on the middle.<br>
[0072]<br>
Furthermore, one sides of the connecting surface 29a, 29b have the guide holes 31a,<br>
31b that constitute the jetting port guide 31. The concaved grooves 39a, 39b that store the<br>
cutter 37 are formed on the other sides.<br>
On the other hand, the guide pieces 34a, 34b are integrally protruded from the<br>
outside of the cylindrical body side. A part of the concaved grooves 39a, 39b is formed on<br>
the connecting surfaces 38a, 38b.<br>
Moreover, the curved concaved parts 42, 43 are disposed on front and back<br>
peripheries of the outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b. The curved concaved part 42 of front side has a<br>
plurality of the concaved parts 44, the concaved part 43 of back side has a plurality of the<br>
convex parts 45.<br>
[0073]<br>
The seal piercing knob 22 is shaped in an elliptical plate which has longer major<br>
axis in front and back and the top surface is gently concaved and curved. The<br>
chevron-shaped rib 23 is protruded from the front side and square hole 22a is disposed on<br>
the lower surface.<br>
The safety plate 27 and the tab 24 are integrally formed. Of them, the safety plate<br>
27 and the seal piercing knob 22 are shaped in virtually the same elliptical plate, and the<br>
notch 28 is disposed on the front side.<br>
The tab 24 is formed in a shape of regular triangular by using a flat bar and the<br>
knob 24a is formed by turning up the front obliquely upward. The rear of the knob 24a is<br>
connected to the back of the safety plate 27 by the connecting part 26 which protruded<br>
obliquely downward.<br>
[0074]<br>
The cylinder holder 5 is formed cylindrical in which the through hole 8 and the<br>
hole 9 are formed therein. The holes are smooth and have different diameters. The lower<br>
part of the cylinder 5 has the screw hole 7, and the jetting port guide 13 and the nozzle hole<br>
14 that are disposed on the middle circumference are communicating with the through hole<br>
8.<br>
A pair of recessed holes 16 is disposed diametrically on the surface of the<br>
circumference of the cylinder holder 5. The pins 15, 15 are pressed into the recess hole 16.<br>
[0075]<br>
The seal piercing pipe 10 is formed in a bar shape, the large-diameter part 10a and<br>
the annular groove 17 are disposed on the middle, and the square shaft 21 are formed on the<br>
top end. One end of a steel pipe is obliquely cut to make the needle tube 19, one end of<br>
the tube 19 is pressed into lower end of the piercing pipe 10, and the tip part 19a is<br>
protruded outside.<br>
In this case, the needle tube 19 can be omitted if the piercing pipe 10 is integrally<br>
provided with the tip part 19a.<br>
Moreover, the cutter 37 is produced by press molding a steel plate, and the fitting<br>
hole 41 is disposed on the middle, and the edge of the cutter 37a is disposed on the side<br>
edge.<br>
[0076]<br>
After the parts above are produced, the piercing device 2 is produced by<br>
assembling them.<br>
For assembly, the engaging hole 30a of the outer pipe piece 6a is stored in the<br>
cylinder holder 5, the positioning pin 15 is inserted to the recess hole 32a, the cutter 37 is<br>
stored in the recessed groove 39a, and the fitting hole 41 is inserted to the pin 40.<br>
Then, the connecting surface 29a of the other outer pipe piece 6b is joined with the<br>
connecting surface 29a, the positioning pin 15 is inserted into the recess hole 32b of the<br>
engaging hole 30b, and after the connecting surfaces 29a, 29b are attached, the outer pipe<br>
pieces 6a, 6b are connected together.<br>
[0077]<br>
When heat welding is used for the connection, for example, an electrical heat plate<br>
(not shown) is inserted between the connecting surfaces 29a, 29b. Then, applying current<br>
to the electrical heat plate and heated to a melting temperature. After the connecting<br>
surfaces 29a, 29b are melted, the electrical heat plate is pulled out, connecting surfaces 29a,<br>
29b are welded, and the cutter 37 and the cylinder holder 5 are integrally buried therein.<br>
In this case, when adhesion is used for connection, adhesive material is applied to<br>
the connecting surfaces 29a, 29b. When screwing is used for the connection, screw holes<br>
are previously disposed at corresponding positions of the outer pipe pieces 6a, 6b and<br>
connect them together by screwing.<br>
[0078]<br>
The piercing pipe 10 is inserted from the lower side of the through hole 8 of the<br>
cylinder holder 5 of the connected outer pipe 6. The top end of the square shaft 21 is<br>
protruded from the hole 9, the square hole 22a of the seal piercing knob 22 is fitted into the<br>
square shaft 21 with the rib 23 facing front, and they are connected together and fixed.<br>
In this case, instead of the attachment above, the square shaft 21 and the seal<br>
piercing knob 22 can be fixed by screwing or can be attached with a retaining ring.<br>
[0079]<br>
After the piercing knob 22 is mounted on the square shaft 21, the safety plate 27 is<br>
inserted therebetween. The notch 28 is inserted to the top of the piercing pipe 10 with the<br>
safety plate 27 sandwiched, and the assembly of the piercing device 2 is completed when<br>
the tab 24 integrally formed with the safety plate 27 is attached on the seal piercing knob<br>
22.<br>
[0080]<br>
As for shape, assembled piercing device 2 is composed about 83 mm high, about<br>
60 mm long in front-back direction, and about 43 mm in external diameter. When the gas<br>
cylinder 1 is loaded to the piercing device 2 which the hammer 47 is already attached<br>
thereto, the spring 20 is inserted to the through hole 8 of the cylinder holder 5 of the<br>
piercing device 2, O-ring 12 is attached to a step between the through hole 8 and the screw<br>
hole 7, and the thread part 4 of the gas cylinder 1 is screwed to the screw hole 7.<br>
[0081]<br>
The fire extinguisher gas ejector which loaded the gas cylinder 1 is shown in the<br>
Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 and is constituted small and lightweight, 183 mm high and weigh 460g.<br>
Unlike conventional ones, it does not require a case that covers the outside of the gas<br>
cylinder 1 so that the constitution becomes simpler and lightweight. Accordingly, it can be<br>
produced easily and at low cost.<br>
Moreover, the cutter 37 and the hammer 47 are provided with the gas cylinder 1<br>
and piercing device 2, essential components for the fire extinguisher gas ejector. It does<br>
not require an exclusive device for escaping so that the mechanisms for fire extinguishing<br>
and escaping are constituted rationally. As for advantages, these functions can be used<br>
simply.<br>
[0082]<br>
The assembled fire extinguisher gas ejector has the tab 24 with the knob 24a raised<br>
and exposed on the seal piercing knob 22, and the safety plate 27 integrally formed with the<br>
tab 24 is located between the seal piercing knob 22 and the outer pipe 6.<br>
The jetting port guide 31 is located at middle and high position on front of the outer<br>
pipe 6, the seat belt guide 34 is protruded obliquely downward, and the edge 37a of the<br>
cutter 37 is perpendicularly disposed in the upper seat belt introduction groove 36.<br>
[0083]<br>
The curved concaved parts 42, 43 that form the grasping part are located<br>
immediately below the jetting port guide 31 and the seat belt guide 34. The upper part of<br>
the gas cylinder 1 is located inside of the concaved parts 42, 43 via space.<br>
The mouth part for the gas cylinder 1 is sealed with the sealing plate 3 as shown in<br>
Fig. 4, the piercing pipe 10 is located immediately above the sealing plate 3 to be able to<br>
move up-and-down, the piercing pipe 10 is biased upwardly to move with the resilience of<br>
the spring 20 and the tip part 19a of the needle tube 19 is located immediately above the<br>
sealing plate 3.<br>
[0084]<br>
The sheet 46 is attached to cover the middle periphery of the cylinder 1, the<br>
hammer 47 is disposed to the bottom of the cylinder 1, and the pointed part 48 is<br>
downwardly exposed. In this case, it is preferable that a suitable cover is removably<br>
attached on the pointed part 48.<br>
[0085]<br>
When installing such fire extinguisher gas ejector on a car, it is stored transversely<br>
or longitudinally around a driver seat, front seat, for example, a pocket of inner side of a<br>
door or an accessory case which is around a shift lever.<br>
In this case, a cross sectional view of the piercing device 2 is formed in a shape of<br>
elliptical which has a major axis in front and back direction so that rolling motion, abnormal<br>
noise and damage of fire extinguisher gas ejector can be prevented when it is put<br>
transversely.<br>
In that case, preferably, if an appropriate holder is mounted to said position in a car<br>
to fix the fire extinguisher gas ejector, further stability can be obtained.<br>
[0086]<br>
When the device is installed on a car and if the seat belt 35 cannot be taken off<br>
or/and a door does not open by a traffic accident, the seat belt 35 need to be cut and/or a<br>
windshield 50 needs to be broken when a driver or other member evacuate outside of the<br>
car.<br>
[0087]<br>
Of them, when cutting the seat belt 35, the curved concaved parts 42, 43 are<br>
grasped facing the seat belt introduction groove 36 of the piercing device 2 front, the seat<br>
belt 35 is inserted into the seat belt introduction groove 36 to contact the edge 37a of the<br>
cutter 37, and the piercing device 2 is pulled down to slice through the seat belt 35. The<br>
state is shown in the Fig. 2.<br>
[0088]<br>
In this case, the seat belt introduction groove 36 is obliquely and downwardly open<br>
with respect to the axial direction of the piercing device 2 so that the seat belt 35 can be<br>
smoothly inserted by the chevron-shaped protrusion 33 compared to a one which has a<br>
groove opens perpendicularly and downwardly.<br>
Moreover, the edge 37a of the cutter 37 is disposed at an acute angle with respect<br>
to the introduction direction of the seat belt 35. The edge 37a of the cutter 37 cuts into the<br>
side edge of the seat belt 35 and prompt smooth cutting, compared to a edge of a cutter is<br>
disposed at right angle with respect to the seat belt introduction groove.<br>
[0089]<br>
When breaking the windshield 50, the fire extinguisher gas ejector is grasped with<br>
the bottom pointing a car side window or windshield, as with the case cutting the seat belt<br>
35. Then, a windshield 50 is smashed with the pointed part 48 of the hammer 47 by<br>
smashing and striking the windshield 50. This state is shown in Fig. 11.<br>
[0090]<br>
In this case, when breaking the windshield 50 after the seatbelt 35 is cut, the<br>
windshield 50 can be broken in continuous motion without shifting the fire extinguisher gas<br>
ejector. Similarly, when cutting the seat belt 35 after breaking the windshield 50, the seat<br>
belt 35 can be cut in continuous motion without shifting a fire extinguisher gas ejector.<br>
Accordingly, the action can be carried out quickly and safely compared with the<br>
one which dispose the seat belt introduction groove 36 and the hammer 47 at the same side<br>
or different position.<br>
Moreover, the hammer 47 is disposed apart from the seat belt introduction groove<br>
36 so that the windshield 50 is smashed surely and there is no fear of being injured.<br>
[0091]<br>
Neither the operation nor impact of cutting the seat belt 35 and breaking the<br>
windshield would separate the safety plate 27 from the fixed position. The movement of<br>
the piercing pipe 10 is prevented so there is no fear of seal piercing accidentally.<br>
[0092]<br>
Next, explanations for the fire extinguisher gas ejector are described below.<br>
Specifically, if a fire occurs and it is extinguished when the fire extinguisher gas<br>
ejector is installed in a car, hold the fire extinguisher gas ejector with one hand, and put the<br>
finger 25 on the knob 24a of the tab 24 and pull up. The state is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
In this case, the tab 24 is configured the same as a known tab for opening a<br>
beverage container so that an operation for pulling the knob 24a up is easily understandable.<br>
It is possible to respond to a fire in a car which needs quick operations.<br>
[0093]<br>
Thus, when the knob 24a of the tab 24 is raised, the tab 24 is pulled up with the<br>
rear connecting part 26, as a fulcrum, against resilience. The component force for<br>
backward acts on the safety plate 27 which is integrally formed with the tab 24 through<br>
connecting part 26.<br>
Therefore, the safety plate 27 is moved backward against the engaging force of the<br>
piercing pipe 10 and the notch 28, and the safety plate 27 is pulled out backwardly.<br>
The state is show in Fig. 12. The top surface of the seal piercing knob 22 is<br>
exposed, and a space, which is the same thickness as the safety plate 27, is formed between<br>
the seal piercing knob 22 and the top edge of the outer pipe 6.<br>
[0094]<br>
Then, the fire extinguisher gas ejector is shifted to grasp the curved concaved parts<br>
42, 43 and the piercing device 2 as shown in Fig. 12. Then, the finger 25 is put on the top<br>
of the seal piercing knob 22 and press down the seal piercing knob 22.<br>
In this way, the piercing knob 22 is descended against the resilience of the spring<br>
20, which moves the piercing pipe 10 accordingly, and the tip part 19a of the needle tube 19<br>
pierces the sealing plate 3. The state is shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[0095]<br>
This introduces the filled gas of the gas cylinder 1 to jet from the pierced point to<br>
the needle tube 19, and the pressure acts on the needle tube 19 and the piercing pipe 10.<br>
Consequently, the jetting pressure thrusts back the piercing pipe 10 and the top end of the<br>
large diameter part 10a is contacted with the step 11 and returned to the original position to<br>
stop.<br>
[0096]<br>
The state is shown in Fig. 14. The needle rube 19 is moved immediately above<br>
the sealing plate 3, the pierced point of the sealing plate 3 is communicated with the through<br>
hole 8, and the through hole 8 is communicated with the nozzle hole 14 and the jetting port<br>
13.<br>
Accordingly, the filled gas is jetted from a pierced hole to the through hole 8 and it<br>
is introduced from the nozzle hole 14 to the jetting port 13. Then, the gas is jetted outside<br>
from the jetting port guide 31 and sprayed onto the source of the fire.<br>
[0097]<br>
At this time, a part of the carbon dioxide is adiabatically expanded to become dry<br>
ice after jetting the filled gas and it is mixed with the gaseous carbon dioxide and jetted<br>
toward the origin of a fire.<br>
Thus, it lowers a temperature around a fire origin and stops oxygen supply. It<br>
promotes efficiency and quick fire extinction.<br>
[0098]<br>
At this time, when the carbon dioxide is jetted, the latent heat cools and absorbs the<br>
heat of the surface of the gas cylinder 1. The skirt part, which is close to the cylinder 1<br>
and lower side of the piercing device 2, prevents heat conduction by a space disposed inner<br>
side so that the finger 25 is not affected.<br>
[0099]<br>
The fire extinction continues until all the filled gas is completely used so that the<br>
filled gas can be effectively used. Thus, the effectiveness of the fire extinction is<br>
increased.<br>
Moreover, after the filled gas is used up, the empty gas cylinder 1 can be easily<br>
recovered after detaching the gas cylinder 1 from the screw hole 7 of the cylinder holder 5.<br>
[0100]<br>
Fig. 15 to Fig. 28 shows other embodiments of the present invention, and identical<br>
numerals are used for the parts that have the same constitution with the above mentioned<br>
embodiment.<br>
Of them, Fig. 15 is a second embodiment of the present invention showing the<br>
other embodiment of the hammer 47.<br>
Specifically, in Fig. 15 (a), the hammer 47 which is made from sintered metal or<br>
press molded steel plate is attached to the bottom of the gas cylinder 1 to alleviate a concern<br>
over strength reduction of the gas cylinder 1 due to thermal stress by heating of spot<br>
welding and brazing.<br>
In Fig. 15 (b), the hammer 47 is insert molded by use of a bowl-shaped plastic<br>
cylinder cover 51. The cover 51 is attached to the exposed bottom of the gas cylinder 1 so<br>
that the cover 51 is rigidly attached.<br>
[0101]<br>
Fig. 16 to Fig. 22 is a third embodiment of the present invention showing other<br>
cutting form of the seat belt 35. the other form of the hammer 47, and installed form of the<br>
fire extinguisher gas ejector in a car.<br>
Of them, as for other cutting form of the seat belt 35, the edge 37a of the cutter 37<br>
is disposed obliquely downward in the middle of the seat belt introduction groove 36, and a<br>
seat belt releasing part 52 is disposed with a space at the rear of the cutter 37.<br>
[0102]<br>
The seat belt releasing part 52 is integrally formed with the joining part 53 which is<br>
disposed back of the seat belt introduction groove 36. The joining part 53 is constituted by<br>
attaching a pair of joining pieces 53a, 53b that connect the seat belt guide 34 and the outer<br>
pipe 6, and the seat belt releasing part 52 is protruded adjacent to the neck portion 54 of the<br>
joining part 53.<br>
[0103]<br>
The seat belt releasing part 52 is constituted by connecting a pair of seat belt<br>
releasing part pieces 52a, 52b. The cross sectional view has a shape of inverted triangular,<br>
which the width increases as it goes to the back of the seat belt introduction groove 36 from<br>
the distal end, the seat belt releasing part 52 has wider width except the distal end than the<br>
thickness of the cutter 37, and the periphery which curves outside forms the seat belt<br>
releasing surface 55. In illustration, reference numeral 56 indicates a space between the<br>
cutter 37 and the seat belt releasing part 52.<br>
[0104]<br>
In this embodiment, the cylinder holder 5 is formed by aluminum and has the<br>
through hole 8 therein, which communicates with the nozzle hole 14. The cylinder holder<br>
5 is buried in the inner pipe cover 57, which is made of synthetic resin, as a insert fixture to<br>
make them integrated. The jetting port 13 and the jetting port guide 31 are formed on the<br>
inner pipe cover 57, and the outer pipe 6 is disposed outside of the inner pipe cover 57.<br>
[0105]<br>
Upper part of the outer pipe 6 has a pair of guide holes 58, and the guide pin 59<br>
which is integrated with the seal piercing knob 22 is slidably inserted to the guide hole 58.<br>
The seal piercing knob 22 has a flat surface top and a recess hole 60 on the center. The<br>
threaded shaft 61 which is provided on the top end of the seal piercing pipe 10 is disposed<br>
in the recess hole 60, and the seal piercing knob 22 is attached to the piercing pipe 10 by<br>
screwing the nut 62 into the threaded shaft 61.<br>
[0106]<br>
The spring 63 which is inserted between the top end surface of the inner pipe cover<br>
57 and a flanged part of the upper end of the piercing pipe 10 is used as a substitute of the<br>
spring 20 which is disposed around the needle tube 19. The resilience of the spring 63<br>
biased the seal piercing knob 22 upwardly. In illustration, reference numeral 64 shows a<br>
cap which closes the recess hole 60.<br>
[0107]<br>
The tab 24 of the embodiment is disposed immediately above the end of the seal<br>
piercing knob 22 with the knob 24a extended. The safety member 27 which is integrally<br>
formed with the tab 24 is formed in a shape of a ring from a plate. This arrangement<br>
promotes the operation of pulling the tab 24 up with notches 65, 66 as a fulcrum and the<br>
operation of pulling the safety member 27 out.<br>
[0108]<br>
Fig. 17 shows the statement of the embodiment in which before the seal is pierced.<br>
The spring 63 biased the seal piercing knob 22 upwardly, intervening the safety member 27<br>
just under the seal piercing knob 22. The tab 24 is located immediate above the seal<br>
piercing knob 22 and the tab 24 is normally restrained to the seal piercing knob 22 with an<br>
adhesive seal (not shown).<br>
When piercing the seal, the adhesive seal is broken, and the knob 24a of the tab 24<br>
is held to pull up and moved toward upper right in Fig. 17. Then the seal piercing knob 22<br>
is pulled out and make a space just under the seal piercing knob 22.<br>
[0109]<br>
Then, the piercing knob 22 is pressed down against the spring 63 and the piercing<br>
pipe 10 is pressed down, and it moves the needle tube 19 in accordance with the move of<br>
the piercing pipe 10. The sealing plate 3 is pierced with the tip part 19a of the needle tube<br>
19. The state is shown in Fig. 18.<br>
After the seal is pierced, the extinguishing gas in the gas cylinder 1 is jetted out,<br>
pushing up the piercing pipe 10 by the extinguishing gas through the needle tube 19. The<br>
gas comes to the through hole 8, then the gas is introduced from the nozzle hole 14 to the<br>
jetting port guide 31 and is jetted outside.<br>
[0110]<br>
On the other hand, in this embodiment, when cutting the seat belt 35, as mentioned<br>
above, the curved concaved parts 42, 43 are grasped facing the seat belt introduction groove<br>
36 front, the seat belt 35 is held with another hand and inserted into the seat belt<br>
introduction groove 36<br>
Then, a side of the seat belt 35 is contacted with the edge 37a of the cutter 37, and<br>
the piercing device 2 is pulled down quickly to slice through the seat belt 35.<br>
[0111]<br>
The state is shown in Fig. 20. Firstly, the side of the seat belt 35 is cut through<br>
with the edge 37a of the cutter 37, and then the cut part is split in two sides along with the<br>
cutter 37 and moved to the back of the seat belt introduction groove 36.<br>
Then, after the cut part passes through the space 56, the cutting pressure of the<br>
cutter 37 and the internal stress are released, then, the fiber is recovered and is moved to the<br>
distal end of the seat belt releasing part 52.<br>
[0112]<br>
After this, the cut part is divided from the distal end and is moved to the back along<br>
with the both sides of the belt releasing surface 55, push opening the cut part. The<br>
spreading function reaches the other side of the seat belt 35, that is the cutting part side. It<br>
prevents the seat belt 35 and the cutter 37 from contacting both sides closely or stagnating.<br>
It promotes the seat belt 35 to move to the back smoothly.<br>
Thus, the seat belt 35 moves smoothly without stagnation from the seat belt<br>
releasing part 52 to the edge 37a of the cutter 37 and smooth and quick cutting is carried out<br>
by the cutter 37.<br>
In this case, when the seat belt releasing part 52 is closely located to the cutter 37<br>
and the seat belt 35 is stuck in the minute space, the move of the seat belt 35 is stagnated<br>
and unable to cut the belt. The space 56 prevents the situation.<br>
[0113]<br>
Fig. 21 is an enlarged view of the hammer 47 that is applied to the other<br>
embodiment.<br>
The hammer 47 of this embodiment is structured with the steel retaining ring 66<br>
and the hammer shaft 67 which quenched steel hard material.<br>
The retaining ring 66 is formed in a shape of plate and has the hole 68 in center.<br>
After the retaining ring 66 is welded to the bottom of the gas cylinder 1, the hammer shaft<br>
67 is inserted to the hole 68 together with the stopper, the C-ring 69. After the insertion,<br>
the tapered surface 70 which is inner rim of the hole 68 is engaged with the C-ring 69 to<br>
attach the hammer shaft 67 closely.<br>
[0114]<br>
The hammer shaft 67 has a shape of axis which is longer than the height of the<br>
retaining ring 66. the annular groove 71, the neck portion, is formed on the base, the pointed<br>
part 72 is formed at the end, and the pointed part 72 is protruded form outside of the<br>
retaining ring 66.<br>
The welding of the retaining ring 66 is carried out after the carbon dioxide is<br>
charged to predetermined pressure and the mouth part is sealed with the sealing plate 3.<br>
After the welding of the retaining ring 66, the gas cylinder 1 and the retaining ring 66 are<br>
plated at the same time.<br>
[0115]<br>
After that, an adhesive is applied to the periphery of the hammer shaft 67 which is<br>
processed with quenching and plating, the C-ring 69 which has elasticity and has a circular<br>
cross section is attached by squeezing to the annular groove 71. The hammer shaft 67 is<br>
inserted to the hole 68 while the C-ring is pushed and shrunk.<br>
After the insertion, the tapered surface 70 of the inner rim of the hole 68 is engaged<br>
with the spherical surface of the C-ring 69 with the elasticity. The C-ring 69 is attached by<br>
pressure to the tapered surface 70 so that the wedge effect is obtained. The adhesive is put<br>
in the gap among the gas cylinder 1, the C-ring 69, and the hammer shaft 67, and then fixed<br>
to attach the hammer shaft 67 stiffly and tightly.<br>
[0116]<br>
In this case, the retaining ting 66 is welded to the gas cylinder 1. The processes of<br>
welding and plating the hammer shaft 67 to the gas cylinder 1 are avoided by engaging the<br>
hammer shaft 67 to the retaining ring 66.<br>
Accordingly, when the hammer shaft 67 is welded to the gas cylinder 1 and plated,<br>
it prevents the situation in which the pointed part 72 of the hammer shaft 67 damages the<br>
periphery of the gas cylinder 1.<br>
As mentioned above, in this embodiment, conventional facilities are available for<br>
filling of the gas and for plating process. The hammer 47 can be attached surely and safely<br>
without changing the procedures.<br>
[0117]<br>
The Fig. 22 shows the fire extinguisher gas ejector which is installed in a car.<br>
The storing case 75 which is like a elongated shape bag and stores the piercing<br>
device 2 with the gas cylinder 1 is stored in the concaved door pocket 74 which is provided<br>
with the inner side of a door 73 adjacent to the driver's seat.<br>
The storing case 75 is made by sewing a plate of soft foamed polyurethane resin.<br>
It is structured with one end closed and the other end is open. The opening side has one<br>
end of the open-close belt 76 which is attached detachably.<br>
One ends of attaching belts 77, 78 are respectively attached to the periphery of the<br>
storing case 75 and the simple stopper 79 such as a hook is disposed at the other ends, and a<br>
stopper 79 is removably attached to a stopper (not shown), such as a hook, which is buried<br>
outside wall of a door pocket 74 to fix a storing case 75 in place.<br>
[0118]<br>
A strap 80 is attached to the other ends of the attaching belt 77, 78 and stuck out to<br>
face a driver's seat. When using the fire extinguisher gas ejector, hold the strap 80 with<br>
one hand and pull up to remove the fixation of the stopper. Then the storing case 75 is<br>
taken out from the door pocket 74.<br>
After taking the storing case 75 out, one end of opening and closing belt 76 is<br>
undone, the piercing device 2 is taken out from the case 75 to carry out an operation of fire<br>
extinguishing, cutting of the seat belt 35, and breaking a windshield 81. In illustration,<br>
reference numeral 82 shows a door trim and 83 shows a power window device.<br>
[0119]<br>
Fig. 23 to Fig. 25 shows a forth embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
embodiment shows a bottomed protective case 84 for storing the piercing device 2 and the<br>
bottom of the case 84 covers the hammer 47. For easy carrying and safety of the piercing<br>
device 2, it is installed, for example, inside of a headrest and an appropriate place of a mat<br>
(not shown) to the fixed position by using a clip.<br>
[0120]<br>
The protective case 84 is shaped like a vertically long bag using light and soft resin<br>
foam. There is an upper opening 85 which is made by cutting the body obliquely, and the<br>
upper opening 85 stores the seal piercing knob 22, the tab 24, the knob 24a, the seat belt<br>
guide 34, seat belt introduction groove 36, and the cutter 37, respectively exposed.<br>
[0121]<br>
A lower opening 86 is formed on the lower part of the other side of the upper<br>
opening 85 of the protective case 84, with the periphery of the gas cylinder 1 located<br>
exposed from the lower opening 86. In illustration, reference numeral 87 shows a plurality<br>
of open holes that have different diameters formed around the upper opening 63. One of<br>
them is opened to correspond with the jetting guide 31.<br>
[0122]<br>
In this case, when breaking the windshield 50, the piercing device 2 is taken out<br>
from the protective case 84 to carry out an operation. In that case, the upper opening 85,<br>
the lower opening 86, and the open hole 87 loosen the contact or adhesion between the<br>
protective case 84 against the piercing device 2 so that the piercing device 2 is taken out<br>
smoothly from the protective case 84.<br>
[0123]<br>
Fig. 26 to Fig. 28 shows a fifth embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, a waste of the extinguishing gas is prevented by stopping discharging the<br>
extinguishing gas which is jetted from the gas cylinder after the seal is pierced. The gas<br>
can be jetted accurately toward a fire origin, and the effective use of the gas and initial fire<br>
fighting can be achieved. It shows the fire extinguisher gas ejector having the control<br>
valve for household use or in car use, which has simpler structure by reducing the number<br>
of the part.<br>
[0124]<br>
In the fifth embodiment, reference numeral 88 shows a case which has a shape of a<br>
virtually hollow tubular made of synthetic resin. It is structured by joining a pair of cut<br>
cases that are formed by cutting the center in half in the longitudinal direction. The case<br>
has a screw part 89 on the lower periphery and a bottomed cap 90 is attached thereto.<br>
[0125]<br>
The case 88 has an opening 91 at top end and an operating lever 92, which is a<br>
piercing member, is attached to the opening 91 to rotate up and down. The operating<br>
lever 92 is structured with a synthetic resin plate which has virtually the same width of the<br>
opening 91, one end has a protruded pin 93 which is slidably inserted to a long hole 94<br>
formed on the case 88, and the other end is protruded from outside rear of the case 88.<br>
[0126]<br>
In illustration, reference numeral 92a is an engaging convex portion which<br>
protruded in the center of the undersurface of the operating lever 92. It is disposed<br>
engageable to the top end of the control valve, which will be described later, and a safety<br>
pin 95 is inserted to the engaging convex portion 92a. Numeral 92b is a concaved finger<br>
grip portion which is formed on the other end of the operating lever 92 and protrudes<br>
backward from the case 88.<br>
[0127]<br>
The safety pin 95 is inserted by penetrating the center of the operating lever 92 and<br>
the case 88. One end of the gasping portion (not shown), protrudes outside of the case 88.<br>
making impossible to press the operating lever 92 in normal times or to pierce the seal<br>
accidentally. When the safety pin 95 is pulled out by pulling the grasping portion (not<br>
shown), an operation of pressing the lever 92 can be performed.<br>
[0128]<br>
The small gas cylinder 1 is stored inside of the case 88, with the bottom stored in<br>
the cap 90. The periphery of the gas cylinder 1 is formed with the thread part 4 and the<br>
thread part 4 is attached to the screw hole 7 of the cylinder holder 5 by screwing.<br>
[0129]<br>
The cylinder holder 5 is formed in a shape of cylinder by aluminum die-casting.<br>
There is an opening for the screw hole 7 at the lower end and the through hole 8, a valve<br>
hole 96, and a hole 97 are disposed to communicate one another at the upper part of the<br>
thread hole 7. The respective inner diameters are formed to become smaller.<br>
The middle to upper periphery of the cylinder holder 5 is provided with the jetting<br>
port 13 which communicates with the jetting port guide 31 formed on the case 88, and the<br>
bottom of the jetting port 13 is disposed with the nozzle hole 14, which communicates the<br>
valve hole 96.<br>
[0130]<br>
The control valve 98 which is integrally formed with the piercing pipe 10 is<br>
slidably inserted to the valve hole 96, and the top end is disposed to appear on top of the<br>
cylinder holder 5. The top end is disposed engageable with the engaging convex portion 92a<br>
when it protrudes.<br>
The needle tube 19 which is a piercing member is protruded from the lower end of<br>
the control valve 98, with the tip part 19a disposed immediately above the sealing plate 3.<br>
In this case, tubular structure is not necessarily required for the needle tube 19.<br>
[0131]<br>
The control valve 98 is formed in a shape of stepped bar, and at least a pair of<br>
O-rings 99, 100 are mounted to the positions of upper and lower of the periphery of the<br>
large diameter part, enabling the valve hole 96 and the nozzle hole 14 to be air tightened by<br>
the O-rings 99, 100.<br>
The spring 20 is inserted between the lower end of the control valve 98 and the<br>
sealing plate 3, and the resilience of the spring 20 biased the control valve 98 upwardly.<br>
The stepped portion 98a which is formed on the middle of the control valve 98 is able to be<br>
engaged with the rim of the lower opening of the hole 97.<br>
[0132]<br>
The control valve 98 is, in normal times, able to close the nozzle hole 14 by<br>
positioning the O-ring 100, which is disposed lower side, at inner rim of the nozzle hole 14.<br>
When pressing the operation lever 92 and piercing the sealing plate 3, the long hole 94<br>
controls the descending displacement of both the operating lever 92 and the control valve 98,<br>
and the O-ring 99, which is disposed upper side, is positioned at inner rim of the nozzle hole<br>
14 to be able to close the nozzle hole 14.<br>
[0133]<br>
Then, when jetting the extinguishing gas by pressing the operation lever 92 after<br>
the piercing, the O-rings 99,100 are respectively positioned at inner rim of the nozzle hole<br>
14, the lower O-ring 100 is positioned at the side of the through hole 8, and the nozzle hole<br>
14 is communicated with the through hole 8 to be able to jet the extinguishing gas from the<br>
nozzle hole 14.<br>
[0134]<br>
In illustration, reference numeral 101 shows a concaved part formed on the top of<br>
the cylinder holder 5, and a lever spring 102 is inserted between the concaved part 101 and<br>
the opening lever 92. The resilience of the spring 102 biased the operating lever 92<br>
upwardly. Numeral 3 a shows a sealed hole of the sealing plate 3.<br>
[0135]<br>
In this embodiment, an outer housing, a piercing holder, a pin, and a pushrod, the<br>
parts to be disposed around the cylinder holder 5 in a conventional fire extinguisher gas<br>
ejector are omitted. Only the cylinder holder 5 is disposed upside of the case 88 so that the<br>
number of the parts are reduced and they are easily assembled. Thus, small and light<br>
structure and low cost of the fire extinguisher gas ejector can be achieved.<br>
In addition, the control valve 98 of this embodiment requires only to form the<br>
annular groove which attaches two O-rings 99,100 at the predetermined position of the<br>
periphery of the piercing pipe 10. Compared to the conventional control valve, the<br>
structure is simpler and the less number of the parts is required. Therefore, it is produced<br>
easily and inexpensively.<br>
[0136]<br>
The fire extinguisher gas ejector is used as follows. The cap 90 is removed before<br>
use, the gas cylinder 1 is inserted from the bottom of the case 88, the thread part 4 of the<br>
mouth part is screwed to the screw hole 7 of the cylinder holder 5 to attach the gas cylinder<br>
1. and the cap 90 is screwed to the lower end of the case 88.<br>
[0137]<br>
In the fire extinguisher gas ejector of above mentioned, the O-ring 100 is<br>
positioned at inner rim of the nozzle hole 14 to close the rim and intermit the guide hole 8,<br>
valve hole 96, and the nozzle hole 14.<br>
The resilience of the spring 20 biases the control calve 98 upwardly and the top end<br>
is protruded from the top of the cylinder holder 5 to engage with the engaging convex<br>
portion 92a of the operating lever 92.<br>
The safety pin 95 is inserted to the operating lever 92 on the center, the pin 95 is<br>
engaged with the top end of the long hole 94 to stop an operation of the operating lever 92.<br>
Moreover, the needle tube 19 is located above the sealing plate 3 for the piercing operation.<br>
The state is shown in Fig. 26.<br>
[0138)<br>
Next, when putting out a fire, the safety pin 95 is pulled out by pulling a grasping<br>
portion (not shown) and the operating lever 92 is unlocked, the operating lever 92 is pressed<br>
down the upper center against the resilience of the spring 20.<br>
In this way, the operating lever 92 is descended horizontally through the pin 93<br>
along with the long hole 94, the engaging convex portion 92a presses the top end of the<br>
piercing pipe 10 and pushes down the control valve 98 against the resilience of the valve<br>
spring 102.<br>
Therefore, the needle tube 19 moves in accordance with the control valve 98, and<br>
the tip part 19a pierces the sealing plate 3. The state is shown in Fig. 27.<br>
[0139)<br>
When piercing, the O-ring 99 moves to the inner rim of the nozzle hole 14 to close<br>
the nozzle hole 14 and intermit the nozzle hole 14 and the through hole 8.<br>
Thus, if the extinguishing gas is jetted from the gas cylinder 1 by piercing and<br>
flowed to the through hole 8, the gas does not flow out from the nozzle hole 14.<br>
[0140)<br>
After the piercing, when releasing a hand from the operating lever 92, the spring 20<br>
pushes up the control valve 98 and the O-ring 100 is moved to the original position which<br>
shown in Fig. 26 to seal the nozzle hole 14. The operating lever 92 is pushed up engaged<br>
with the piercing pipe 10 and the pin 93 moves to the original position in Fig 26 engaged<br>
with the top end of the long hole 94.<br>
Accordingly, after the piercing, the extinguishing gas is jetted swiftly to the<br>
through hole^fc from the pierced hole 3a of the sealing plate 3. However, the O-ring 100<br>
stops the outflow of the gas from the nozzle hole 14, and the O-ring 99 prevents the leakage<br>
from the valve hole 96 and the gas stagnates in the through hole 8.<br>
[0141]<br>
Under the situation like the above-mentioned, a finger is put on a finger grip<br>
portion 92b and press the operating lever 92 down against the resilience of the lever spring<br>
102. Then, the operating lever 92 rotates downward with the pin 93, which acts as a<br>
fulcrum, and the engaging convex portion 92a presses the piercing pipe 10 down.<br>
Then, the O-ring 99, 100 moves lower, the O-ring 100 uncloses the nozzle hole 14<br>
and moves to the upper part of the through hole 8, communicating the nozzle hole 14 with<br>
the through hole 8, and the O-ring 99 moves to immediate above the rim of the inner side of<br>
the nozzle hole 14 to seal the valve hole 96.<br>
[0142]<br>
The state is shown in Fig. 28. The descending displacement of the piercing pipe<br>
10 and the control valve 98 is less than when the seal is pierced. Therefore, the O-ring 99<br>
does not close the nozzle hole 14, and the pierced hole 3a is not closed by inserting the<br>
needle tube 19. The nozzle hole 14 is remained open and the jetting of the extinguishing<br>
gas from the pierced hole 3a is remained.<br>
Consequently, the extinguishing gas is jetted from the nozzle hole 14 to the jetting<br>
port 13 and jetted outside from the jetting guide 31 toward a fire origin.<br>
[0143]<br>
As mentioned above, the control valve 98 in the embodiment, the extinguishing gas<br>
which is jetted after the piercing is once stagnated in the through hole 8. When the<br>
through hole 8 and the nozzle hole 14 are communicated with each other by the operation of<br>
the operating lever 92 after the seal is pierced, the extinguishing gas is accurately jetted to a<br>
fire origin.<br>
Then, releasing a hand from the operating lever 92 when jetting the gas, the O-ring<br>
100 seals the nozzle hole 14, as mentioned above, the jetting of the extinguishing gas is<br>
stopped, and the O-ring 99 stops the leakage from the valve hole 96 and the gas stagnates in<br>
the through hole 8. Accordingly, the unused extinguishing gas after the seal piercing is<br>
used effectively.<br>
[INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY]<br>
[0144]<br>
Accordingly, the fire extinguisher gas ejector of the present invention easily and<br>
quickly removes the safety member, pierce the seal of the small gas cylinder mounted<br>
therewith, and jet the gas promptly to attempt early fire extinction. This invention<br>
comprises the emergency escape mechanism from vehicle, which cuts a seat belt promptly<br>
and breaks the windshield surely in case such as a fire in vehicle and collision, and attempts<br>
a prompt escape from vehicle. Moreover, it does not require a device exclusive to escape.<br>
Mechanisms for fire extinction and escaping are rationally constituted. The hammer can<br>
be rationally and safely attached to the gas cylinder. The invention comprises the control<br>
valve which prevents the waste of the extinguishing gas and jets the fire extinguishing gas<br>
to the origin of a fire surely and accurately in fire fighting. Thus, the present invention is<br>
suitable for a fire extinguisher, for example, used in a vehicle.<br>
