				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method for  controlling  and  monitoring  a railway  engineering   installation.<br>
Various methods are used in railway traffic signal boxes to construct routes. Signal boxes operating according to the interlocking table principle are based on the use of the interlocking and isolation tables shown in [2], Fig. 25 and Fig. 26, in which the static status of installation elements such as level crossings, tracks, section blocks, signals and points is shown for the specified route control systems. Additional conditions are specified in footnotes to the tables for rules, as are some process-dependent relationships between the installation elements, as determined by operating regulations and geographical features, and these should be taken into account for the control of the individual installation elements. The formulations for these additional conditions do not have  a  one  to  one correspondence  for all  conditions  in practice.  The completeness of the description of the system, which is used for the safe formation, monitoring and cancellation of routes, by means of interlocking and isolation   tables   and   footnotes,   is   therefore   scarcely   ever   guaranteed. Interdependencies between routes which arise or change during the processes are not recorded. The correct implementation of interlocking and isolation tables and footnotes requires project planners, who identify and manage the links, which might have to be taken into account in the control of the installation   elements,   through   their  professional   experience.   A   precise knowledge of the entire functional scope of the installation modules of the signal boy is required for this.<br>
1A<br><br>
The object of this invention is therefore to specify a method for the control and monitoring of a traffic engineering installation with actuating and monitoring elements, which is simple to implement for installations with any route<br>
structures.<br>
The method and other advantageous<br><br><br>
embodiments of the invention are described  hereunder.<br>
The method according to the invention allows simple project planning for traffic engineering installations, specifically electronic signal boxes for railway engineering. According to the invention, the control processes for the construction and/or dismantling of routes is based on the complete assignment of parameters to the installation elements. Track release devices are also listed based on the sequence in which these are passed when the route to be controlled is travelled. In particular this allows greater availability of the traffic engineering installation. Routes can be dismantled and reconstructed more quickly. Also faults can be more easily identified and corrected.<br>
o	For each route to be constructed, parameters are reassigned to the<br>
installation elements for the monitoring and release of track sections,<br>
hereafter referred to as release devices, and these parameters are used to<br>
determine the sequence of the release devices within a route to be<br>
controlled.<br>
o	At least one parameter is assigned to the other installation elements, by<br>
means of which assignment of an installation element to one or more<br>
release devices is determined.<br>
2<br><br>
o	Where appropriate, other parameters are assigned to the installation<br>
elements, containing control-relevant data. There is then no need for<br>
footnotes to the tables.<br>
o	Complex operating conditions are preferably recorded and described in<br>
full in a table comprising at least one row. This is used to determine the<br>
status of a logical parameter, which can be assigned to the installation<br>
elements.<br>
The control processes for the construction and/or dismantling of routes can be unequivocally and reliably implemented at low cost by assigning parameters to<br>
the installation elements, as set out in the table.	<br>
Fig.   1  of   the  accompanying The invention is described below using drawing by way of an example. This<br>
shows a railway installation with two tracks GL1, GL2 running parallel from A to B and C to D, which are connected to each other by means of two connecting tracks GL12, GL21 and two points Wl, W3 and W4, W2 connected to each of these connecting tracks GL12, GL21. The tracks GL1, GL2 are divided into different areas, which are monitored by (track) release devices FM1,..., FM14, which are in the form of track circuits or axle counters,<br>
A release device FM processes the data from one or more track circuits and/or axle counters. The identified status of the relevant track section is reported to a signal box. For safety reasons, these reports are in antivalent or redundant form. Track release devices with direct or alternating current track circuits or axle counters are, for example, described in [1], pages 277-316, or in [3].<br>
In the railway installation shown, the track areas around the points Wl, ..., W4 are monitored to the centre of the associated connecting tracks GL12, GL21 by<br>
3<br><br>
be specified, in order for the control process to be implemented fully and unequivocally. Preferably a number of parameters are assigned in a parameter list as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>
Table<br>
Figure-!) Parameter list<br>
Naturally the parameter list can be adapted in any way required to the project planner's needs. Parameters can be changed around, added or omitted. Once<br>
6<br><br>
7<br>
the parameter list has been adapted to the existing installation elements, further changes should not be necessary and should be avoided. The parameter list, which can now be used for the elements of any installation, is used to create a table for an installation project, in which the parameter values and the possible statuses and assignments of the installation elements for all required routes are determined.<br><br><br><br>
Table 2) Interlocking table<br>
Table 2 shows the parameter values and the possible statuses and assignments of the installation elements for route 5. A column is provided for every parameter to be taken into account. The full table with parameters for all installation elements contains a total of twenty columns for all five routes and a column for the list of installation elements. The conditions for the installation elements are specified in 29 rows.<br>
This extended interlocking table according to the invention in conjunction with the parameter list is used to describe fully and unequivocally all the conditions for the control of the installation and for constructing and dismantling routes. A control programme compatible with the installation computer can therefore be<br>
8<br><br>
generated manually or preferably automatically on the basis of the interlocking table. The control program can therefore be generated automatically by a programme generator given the technical processing capacity of the interlocking table, in which all conditions and assignments are specified in full.<br>
Additional conditions for any installation elements, which until now could only be taken into account at great expense, are added in additional rows. A logical combination Tl of a number of conditions specified in a further row can also be used to take more complex conditions into account. These conditions or combinations of conditions can be taken into account as parameters in other rows.<br>
This full and problem-oriented description for controlling the process, in standard railway engineering syntax (see tables in Figure 1 and Figure 2), allows direct use of the description for verifying the results of the actuating process for route control and cancellation operating on a data processing installation. This means that errors in computer system processing can be easily identified.<br>
The first parameter in the interlocking table interlocking table is particularly important for advantageous control of the installation. This characterises the release devices FM on the basis of their sequence in the route and assigns the other installation elements (points, signals, etc.) to at least one release device FM. These measures are particularly advantageous with regard to ensuring greater safety during the course of the control process. These measures also increase the availability of routes. Sections of controlled routes can be re-released on the basis of the determined sequence of the release devices FM after passage of the vehicle, achieving partial cancellation of the route. The<br>
9<br><br>
"cancelled" sections of the route are then available again for the construction of other routes, if the vehicle has not yet reached the end of the route. A release device FM is used to register the passage of a vehicle through a section of track, so that all installation elements assigned to the release device FM can be released, once the section of route has been uncoupled.<br>
The first parameter on the list given as an example according to Figure 1 for the installation shown has been explained above. Parameters 2 and 3 for points relate to the controllable position and the function of the points on the route. For example, it is not occupied but used as side protection to keep conflicting routes away from the controlled route. Parameter 2 for release devices relates to the condition to be satisfied for changing the start signal to green (or travel release). Parameter 3 specifies the criteria, according to which a section should be monitored. Parameter 4 specifies which criteria have to be satisfied for the route or preferably a section of route to be cancelled or released. Parameter 2 for signals defines the function of the signal. Parameter 3 specifies the travel aspect to be displayed and parameter 4 specifies the condition to be satisfied for signal change.<br>
Under certain circumstances special user requirements have to be taken into account when controlling the installation, based on a specific operating regulation or the special geographical location of the installation to be controlled. Further rows are preferably provided for this purpose, in which additional conditions are specified, which have to be taken into account as parameters in the interlocking table (e.g. as parameter no. 4 for actuating signals). A number of conditions can also be combined in an additional row. In the interlocking table, row 29, the conditions A and B specified in row 27 and<br>
10<br><br>
row 28 are ANDed. The result of the combination, represented by the variable Tl, is specified as a condition in row 5 for the signal S5, under parameter 4. The signal S5 should then only be changed to the travel aspect "travel", if the associated level crossing is protected by barrier BA1 shown in the figure and a monitoring system B-. This means that any other application-specific conditions can be taken into account. Conditions A, B, ... can of course also be taken into account individually in rows 1, ...,26.<br>
In larger table formats the elements FM, S, etc. are preferably shown in the columns, and the parameters in the rows.<br>
The solution according to the invention can also be used to identify errors and correct them at process logic level. In current signal boxes track sections are monitored, as stated above, by means of axle counters and/or track circuits, for example. A logical combination of the counter results of two axle counters is used to determine whether a train has passed and completely left a track section. If a train has passed the relevant track section and the axle counters show different counter results, the route is not cancelled with known installations. At present the error can only be located with difficulty due to a number of possible influences. The logical combination of counter results for a number of axle counters in consecutive sections means that errors can be corrected directly in the axle logic. The cost of connecting axle counters in this way is high.<br>
However, according to the invention, the sequence is determined, in which release devices are located and passed within a route. Release devices are axle counters and/or release track circuits or other systems for detecting the occupancy of a section of rail.<br>
11<br><br>
In the table below the rows of the interlocking table are organised on the basis of parameter 1 (the values of parameter 1 increase consistently from row to row). It can be seen from the drawing that the sequence of release devices FM8 FM9 FM10 FM11 FM12, FM5, FM6 and FM7 corresponds to the sequence of the track sections which are crossed in sequence when route 5 is used.<br>
The condition If (occupancy and re-release) is specified under parameter 4 for cancellation of the route. Each of these track sections must therefore be occupied and re-released before cancellation.<br><br>
Table 3) Rows 17-24 of the interlocking table organised on the basis of the values of parameter 1.<br>
If the release devices FM8, FM9, FM10 and FM12 now report that condition If of parameter 4 (track section occupied and re-released) is satisfied, it is easy to determine that an error has occurred in release device FM11. Reports from other release devices (FM5, FM6 and FM7) can be obtained to verify this.<br>
12<br><br>
Then, after processing the error picture, using logical rules where necessary and possible, corrective measures, which are permissible in a railway engineering context, are instituted on release of the track sections. The occupied track can be blocked or wholly or partially cancelled in accordance with the specified safety rules. If corrections are not permissible, in other words no response errors are identified, a request can be made for optical verification of the relevant track section (e.g. a check is carried out to ascertain whether a carriage has become separated from the train configuration). Axle counters and/or track circuits, which are subject to error under certain circumstances, may be subjected to a test procedure or, if necessary, deactivated until overhaul and functionally replaced. It is particularly advantageous that the necessary corrective measures can be applied on the basis of detailed error data targeting the process control level.<br>
