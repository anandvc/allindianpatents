				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INHIBITING PROJECTION OF SELECTED<br>
AREAS OF A PROJECTED IMAGE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
On a relatively small screen, in a conference room or classroom, the speaker easily points to areas on the screen with the aid of a pointer stick.  The use of larger projection screens requires the speaker to use a laser pointer or to advance into the projected scene to point to various elements.<br>
Many a speaker having entered into the scene would like to turn and look directly at his audience as he speaks. Unfortunately, being in the projection beam, he is blinded by the projector and cannot see his audience. Furthermore, the scene with its text and graphics, is projected onto the speaker, which is quite distracting to an audience.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
A video projector shows the desired scene on a projection screen. An infrared source close to the video projector uniformly floods the projection screen with non-visible infrared radiation.  An infrared sensitive camera, also close to the video projector, observes the projection screen and sees only the uniform infrared illumination of the screen.  Upon entry of a subject into the projected video image, the infrared reflected from the subject will not match that of the projection screen and thus the subject area is identified. All pixels of the projected scene, in the area occupied by the subject, are inhibited before reaching the video projector. The subject may then look directly at an audience without being blinded by the projector.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Figures Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the components<br>
comprising this invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a curve showing the relationship between<br>
infrared deviation from that of the screen and the<br>
reduction of video signal.<br>
Fig. 3 is a logic diagram of the elements of an<br>
operational system.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
. Item 1 of figure 1 represents the source of video image to be projected onto projection screen 3 . Item 1 may be a computer, videocassette, digital videodisc, another camera or other source of video image.<br>
The video program signal from image source 1 is connected to inhibitor 2 where the video signal at selected pixels may be inhibited. The program signal is then connected from inhibitor 2 to video projector 6, which projects the program image on projection screen 3.<br>
In one embodiment, an infrared source 7 is used to uniformly illuminate projection screen 3. Being infrared, this illumination is not seen by the viewer. Camera 5 is an infrared sensitive video camera observing the uniformly illuminated projection screen.  Camera 5 output is connected to video inhibitor 2. The infrared signal at inhibitor 2 from the projection screen is nulled to zero. In the event a subject 4 enters into the projection beam, the subject's infrared reflection is likely to be higher or lower than the uniform infrared luminance level of the projection screen. Any infrared deviation from the infrared signal level established for the projection screen represents the subject.  The addresses of those detected pixels that identify the subject location are<br><br>
used to inhibit the video program signal at these same addresses.<br>
There is always a possibility that some small area on the subject's wardrobe will reflect exactly the same amount of infrared as the screen. In this area, the inhibitor is fooled and the video signal is not inhibited. Such areas are of little concern since there is little probability of infrared reflection from the subject's face matching that.of the screen.<br>
The probability of deceiving the inhibit logic is reduced by selecting the infrared camera's pass band least likely to match the reflection levels of the subject.<br>
The near infrared bandwidth is very wide, and the infrared provided by an incandescent source provides a flat wide illumination bandwidth. The infrared sensitive camera may therefore be equipped with filters of adjoining pass bands such as 700-800, 800-900, and 900-1000 nanometers. It takes only a small shift in the pass band to effect a large change in infrared reflection. A filter selection may be made during setup to prevent the subject's infrared reflection from matching that of the screen.<br>
An alternative to selecting external pass band camera filters is to incorporate two or more infrared image channels in the camera, each filtered to a different pass band, with a separate infrared reference frame stored for each pass band.<br>
It is highly unlikely the subject's infrared reflection would simultaneously match the infrared reflection of two or more infrared pass bands. Options<br>
The objective of this invention is to inhibit the projected image from falling upon the subject when the subject enters into the projected image. It is therefore<br><br>
necessary to separate the subject from the scene being projected  upon i t.<br>
There are several existing ways of detecting a subject's location. A standard difference key, or matte, relies on a reference frame of .the blank screen to compare with each succeeding frame to detect the subject's location. Since an image within the visible spectrum is also being projected onto the screen, a standard difference key does not appear to function in this application.<br>
Another option is to flood the projection screen with one or more bands of ultra violet light outside visible wavelengths.<br>
One might also separate the subject from the projection screen by using a long wave infrared camera sensitive to the temperature of the human body. Since a camera of this type sees body temperature, there is no need to flood the screen with long wave infrared.<br>
Other methods identify the subject presence by radar or sonar techniques that detect a subject as being at a shorter distance than the screen.<br>
Stereoscopic devices, and maximizing image detail, have been used in automatic cameras to determine distance. Any scheme that provides a signal separating the subject from the projected image may be used in this invention to inhibit the projected image in the area occupied by the subject.<br>
Preferred Option<br>
A preferred option, used in this invention, is the use of near infrared to illuminate the projection screen. The infrared luminance level of the projection screen may be monitored and the reference frame updated to compensate for line voltage changes to the infrared source.  The<br><br>
updated, reference frame permits improved subject detection when infrared differences are very small.  By using the infrared portion of the radiation spectrum, the projected and detected infrared images are immune from projected image content changes.<br>
Using infrared illumination to generate a difference or ratio matte provides a practical method of identifying those pixels occupied by a subject. Equations for generating suitable ratio and difference mattes for this purpose are as follows:<br>
Ratio Matte If IRo  IRm M = IRm / IRo If IRm = IRo = 0 M = 0<br>
Difference Matte M = 1 - {max [{IRo - IRm) , (IRm - IRo}]}<br>
Where:<br>
IRo = observed IR pixel value<br>
IRm = stored IR pixel value (at the same location)<br>
M = calculated matte value<br>
Inhibiting of the projected image may be continuous, either linear or nonlinear, as opposed to a switch action. If nonlinear, the earliest and smallest detectable variance of the infrared signal is made to cause a small reduction of video signal level. As the deviation increases, the rate of inhibition increases. When the deviation nears a selected level, the inhibition rate is rapidly increased to cutoff, or to a selected low level near cutoff.  The variable rate at which signal inhibition<br><br>
occurs prevents the on-off flicker effect of a switch action. Figure 2 illustrates this relationship.<br>
The term "inhibit" is defined as a reduction in the level of the projected image in that area occupied by the subject. In fact, if the level is reduced to about 5% of full level, the visibility of the subject is reduced to visual black. With little or no projector illumination onto the subject, it will receive no illumination other than ambient room light, which is typically attenuated to a very low level when using a projector.<br>
Since subject illumination from the video projector has been inhibited to near zero, RGB levels representing white (or colored) light may be added to those pixels defining the subject area. The illumination of the subject may therefore be increased above that produced by ambient light alone. Although at a lower level, supplementary subject illumination augmenting ambient room light, is likely to be somewhat annoying to the subject facing the projector. .<br>
The techniques described in U.S. Patent. No. 5,270,820 may be used to locate the speaker's head (or other extremity). With this additional information, the projected white (or colored) light onto the subject may be inhibited in the region of his head and eyes.<br>
The term "projection screen" or "screen" has been used above. This screen may be white, beaded, metallic, or metallic coated lenticular, or any surface suitable for viewing a projected image.<br>
Implementation<br>
In figure 1, item 1, the video program source may be a computer, videotape, or videodisc as selected by the user.<br><br>
The video projector 6 and projection surface 3 are commercial devices selected by the user. An infrared filter, if needed, removes any residual infrared in the video projection beam.<br>
The infrared sensitive camera 5 is a video camera whose photoreceptors extend into the near infrared beyond 700 nanometers.  A filter is placed over the camera lens to remove visible wavelengths.<br>
The infrared source 7 is a projector using an incandescent lamp. A filter is placed over the infrared source to remove visible light. Item 2 is the detector/inhibitor. Its function has been described earlier.<br>
Figure 3 is a logic flow diagram showing the functions of subject detection and program signal inhibiting.  Referring to figure 3, box I may be a 480 line VGA progressive scan low resolution camera, or any other low resolution camera sensitive to near infrared. Box 2 is a stored infrared image of the infrared illuminated screen with the subject removed from the scene.  The mask generator 3 compares the infrared sensitive camera image with the clear frame image in memory 2 and any difference identifies that area occupied by a subject, if present.  Box 4 shapes the subject detection signal from an on-off signal to a linear, or a nonlinear signal as shown in figure 2.<br>
Box 5 is the program source to be projected onto the projection screen. The program video is generally an image of much higher resolution than an NTSC signal. Box 6-determines the resolution of the program image and connects this size data to box 7, which acts as a standards converter, to scale the size of the infrared camera to match the size of the projected image. Having matched image sizes, the program image is inhibited in box<br><br>
8 in the area occupied by a subject, if a subject is present. Projector 9 projects program image onto the screen, but does not project the program onto the subject.<br><br><br>
