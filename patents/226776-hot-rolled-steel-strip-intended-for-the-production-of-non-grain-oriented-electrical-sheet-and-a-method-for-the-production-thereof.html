				<td>HOT-ROLLED STEEL STRIP INTENDED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NON-<br>
GRAIN ORIENTED ELECTRICAL SHEET AND A METHOD FOR THE<br>
PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to a hot-rolled steel strip intended<br>
for the production of electrical sheet and a method for the<br>
production thereof.<br>
In this context, the term "non-grain oriented electrical<br>
sheet" is taken to mean a steel sheet or a steel strip<br>
which regardless of its texture comes under the sheets<br>
mentioned in DIN 46 400 Part 1 or 4 and the loss anisotropy<br>
of which does not exceed the maximum values established in<br>
DIN 46 400 Part 1. The terms "sheet" and "strip" are used<br>
synonymously here.<br>
The production of non-grain oriented electrical sheet (NO<br>
electrical sheet) conventionally comprises the steps:<br>
melting the steel,<br>
casting the steel to form slabs,<br>
if necessary, reheating the slabs,<br>
using the slabs in a hot-rolling line,<br>
pre-rolling the slabs,<br>
finishing hot-rolling of the slabs to form a hot<br>
strip, of which the end thickness is between 1.8 mm<br>
and 5 mm, typically between 2 mm and 3 mm,<br>
annealing and pickling of the hot strip wherein these<br>
hot strip treatments can be carried out as combined<br>
annealing pickling,<br>
cold-rolling to an end thickness in the region of 0.75<br>
mm to 0.35 mm or smaller or, if necessary, cold-<br>
rolling of the hot strip to end thickness taking place<br>
in multi-stages with interposed annealing, and<br><br>
final annealing of cold strips of this type in end<br>
thickness, which have been cold-rolled with a degree<br>
of total deformation of at least 65%, or<br>
annealing and subsequent rerolling with a degree of<br>
total deformation of at most 20%.<br>
Not until the cold-rolling process is softening of the<br>
structure achieved by a recrystallisation, degrees of total<br>
deformation of &gt; 65% being required to achieve the<br>
conventional end thicknesses of the end product "cold-<br>
rolled NO electrical strip" (starting point hot strip &gt; 1.8<br>
mm, end thickness 0.35 to 0.75 mm). Characteristic of a<br>
softened structure is an intensity distribution of the a<br>
fibre texture such that an increased intensity of the<br>
component {112}  occurs and the cold-rolling component<br>
{001}  is largely removed.<br>
Therefore the cold-rolling with these high degrees of total<br>
deformation creates the prerequisite for the possibility of<br>
using a final annealing, which is conventional nowadays, in<br>
the form of a "short-time annealing" (through-type furnace<br>
- short times of high temperatures for the strip) with the<br>
aim of achieving a softened structure and an optimum grain<br>
size in the finished product "cold-rolled NO electrical<br>
strip".<br>
The large number of working steps to be carried out in a<br>
conventional procedure of this type leads to high<br>
expenditure in terms of apparatus and costs. Therefore<br>
recently increased efforts have been made to design the<br>
casting of the steel and subsequent rolling processes in<br>
the hot strip production such that a hot strip with a<br>
thickness of 
<br>
aim is a continuous sequence of the casting and rolling<br>
process dispensing with the reheating and the pre-rolling.<br>
For this purpose, so-called "casting/rolling plants" have<br>
been developed and set up. In these devices also known as<br>
"CSP plants", the steel is cast to form a continuously<br>
drawn billet (thin slab) which is then hot-rolled "in-line"<br>
to form hot strip. The experiences obtained in operating<br>
casting/rolling plants and the advantages of the<br>
casting/rolling carried out "in-line" have been documented,<br>
for example in W. Bald et al. "Innovative Technologie zur<br>
Banderzeugung", Stahl und Eisen 119 (1999) No. 3, pages 77<br>
to 85, or C. Hendricks et al. "Inbetriebnahme und erste<br>
Ergebnisse der Gie?walzanlage der Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG",<br>
Stahl und Eisen 120 (2000) No. 2, pages 61 to 68.<br>
However, even in the framework of conventional plant<br>
engineering for hot-rolling, including the pre- and<br>
intermediate rolling, an attempt is made in the use of<br>
conventional slabs to achieve hot strip thicknesses of 
1.5 mm, see for example JP 2001 123225 A2.<br>
The invention was based on the object of realising an<br>
economically producible hot strip with a partially softened<br>
structure with a thickness of at most 1.8 mm which, owing<br>
to these properties, is especially suitable for producing<br>
high-grade electrical sneets.<br>
This object is achieved starting from the above-described<br>
prior art by a hot-rolled steel strip, which has the<br>
following composition (in ÷ by weight):<br>
C: 
Mn: ? 1.2 %<br><br>
Si: 0.1-4.4%<br>
Al 0.1-4.4%,<br>
wherein the sum formed from the Si content and twice the Al<br>
content ([% Si] + 2 x [% Al]) is 
P: 
Sn: ? 0.20%<br>
Sb: ? 0.20%,<br>
the remainder iron and unavoidable impurities,<br>
the strip thickness of which steel strip is at most<br>
1.8 mm, and<br>
which has a partially softened structure, which is<br>
characterised by a high intensity of the a fibre<br>
(fibre representation of orientation distribution<br>
functions) in the range to 60°.<br>
The invention proceeds from the recognition that with a<br>
choice of a suitable method of production, a hot strip can<br>
be provided which already in the hot-rolled state has a<br>
structure which can be produced only by cold-rolling with<br>
high degrees of deformation in a conventional manner of<br>
production. Thus, a hot strip composed and made up<br>
according to the invention with a strip thickness of at<br>
most 1.8 mm has a partially softened structure. This<br>
structure is distinguished by high intensities of the a<br>
fibre in the range of angles up to 60° for specific<br>
positions, in other words in an angle range in which, in<br>
the case of conventional hot strips of comparable<br>
composition, no noteworthy intensities would be generally<br><br>
able to be established for these positions. The high<br>
intensities of the specific positions (112)  and (111)<br> are characteristic, wherein for the ratios of the<br>
intensities I112 of the position (112)  to the<br>
intensity I001 of the position (001)  a value &gt; 0.4 is<br>
produced and for the ratios of the intensity I111 of the<br>
position (111)  to the intensity I001 of the position<br>
(001)  a value &gt; 0.2 is produced. Owing to this<br>
composition, hot strip according to the invention can be<br>
processed in an excellent manner to form cold-rolled NO<br>
electrical sheet, the end thickness of which is typically<br>
0.35 mm to 0.75 mm, in particular 0.2 mm, 0.35 mm, 0.50 mm<br>
or 0.65 mm.<br>
Conventional hot strips differ from those according to the<br>
invention in that in the case of these noteworthy<br>
intensities only occur in the range of up to 25° (-30°),<br>
while for the components (112)  and (111)  no<br>
further higher intensities can be established. In the<br>
conventional hot strips, an intensity maximum of the a<br>
fibre structure is typically present at 0°, from which the<br>
intensity decreases with an increasing angle. This<br>
intensity distribution of the a fibre corresponds to a<br>
hardened structure. Only owing to the cold-rolling process<br>
is a softening of the structure achieved in the case of<br>
such steel strips by a recrystallisation in the subsequent<br>
annealing. For this purpose, degrees of total deformation<br>
of more than 65% are required which, on the one hand,<br>
assume a specific minimum thickness of the hot strip to be<br>
cold-rolled and, on the other hand, a considerable rolling<br>
power in the cold-deformation of the strip.<br>
Hot strip according to the invention is composed in<br>
comparison such that the intensities of the component (112)<br><br> and the intensities of the position (111)  are<br>
high. At the same time, hot strip according to the<br>
invention has a particularly small end thickness. The hot<br>
strip according to the invention thus creates far more<br>
favourable conditions for the subsequent processing than<br>
the conventional hot strips can achieve. Thus, hot strip<br>
according to the invention starting from its small<br>
thickness of at most 1.8 mm with a minimised total<br>
deformation can be cold-formed into a non-grain oriented<br>
electrical sheet, the properties of which are at least<br>
equal to the properties of conventionally produced NO<br>
electrical sheets.<br>
In relation to the terms used a fibre, intensity and<br>
position, it should be remembered that the texture of a<br>
crystalline phase is described quantitatively by means of<br>
the orientation distribution function.<br>
The orientation distribution function describes the<br>
relative position of the crystal coordinate system and<br>
sample coordinate system. The orientation distribution<br>
function allocates each point in the space an orientation<br>
density or intensity. As representation of the orientation<br>
distribution function is very complicated and not very<br>
graphic, a simplified description is selected with the aid<br>
of fibres. The fibres relevant for steels are:<br>
a fibre, y fibre, ? fibre, ?, fibre, 5 fibre.<br>
In the a fibre observed here, the  direction is<br>
parallel to the rolling direction; it extends between the<br>
positions (001)  and (110) .<br><br>
Hot strip according to the invention has a particular<br>
favourable softening state for further processing when its<br>
strip thickness is at most 1.2 mm. With hot strip according<br>
to the invention which is as thin as this, the ratio<br>
I112/I001 formed from the intensity I112 of the position (112)<br> to the intensity I001 of the position (001)  of<br>
the a fibre is &gt; 0.75 and the ratio I111/I001 formed from the<br>
intensity Iin of the position (111)  to the intensity<br>
I001 of the position (001)  of the a fibre is &gt; 0.4.<br>
Hot strip softened in this way can be processed with<br>
particularly small degrees of deformation into NO<br>
electrical sheet.<br>
Hot strips according to the invention with hot strip<br>
thicknesses of 
ways; conventional hot strip lines with possibilities for<br>
producing the above thicknesses, continuous casting and<br>
rolling plants (casting of thin slabs with subsequent in-<br>
line hot-rolling), thin strip casting plants with<br>
subsequent single or multi-stage hot-rolling of the thin<br>
strip.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the method<br>
according to the invention, at least one pass of the hot-<br>
rolling is carried out at temperature, at which the hot<br>
strip has an austenitic structure, and a plurality of<br>
subsequent passes of the hot-rolling are carried out at<br>
temperatures in which the hot strip has a ferritic<br>
structure. Owing to rolling deliberately carried out in<br>
this way in the individual phase state regions, in<br>
particular in the case of converting alloys, hot strips can<br>
be produced which have optimised properties with respect to<br>
the demands placed on NO electrical sheets. It has been<br><br>
shown, for example, that owing to a suitable combination of<br>
the phase sequence in hot-rolling in conjunction with<br>
specific end rolling and coiler temperatures, a decisive<br>
raising of the magnetic polarisation can be achieved. To<br>
ensure that at least the last pass of the hot-rolling is<br>
carried out with a ferritic structure in the hot strip, the<br>
end rolling temperature during hot-rolling should be less<br>
than 850°C.<br>
During the hot-rolling, at least during one of the last<br>
deformation passes, rolling is carried out with<br>
lubrication. Owing to the hot-rolling with lubrication, on<br>
the one hand, smaller shear deformations occur, so that the<br>
rolled strip receives a more homogeneous structure over the<br>
cross-section as a result. On the other hand, owing to the<br>
lubrication, the rolling forces are reduced, so that a<br>
greater reduction in thickness is possible over the<br>
respective rolling pass. Therefore, according to the<br>
desired properties of the electrical sheet to be produced,<br>
it may be advantageous if all the forming passes taking<br>
place in the ferrite region are carried out with a rolling<br>
lubrication.<br>
Hot strips according to the invention, can be produced in<br>
particular with reliably reproducible working results in<br>
that initially a steel composed according to the invention<br>
is melted and then the steel is cast into thin slabs which<br>
are then continuously ("in-line") hot-rolled to form hot<br>
strip. The extent of total deformation achieved during the<br>
hot-rolling is preferably at least 90%, the hot-rolling<br>
generally being carried out in a plurality of passes.<br>
The continuous sequence particular to known continuous<br>
casting and rolling, of casting the steel to form thin<br><br>
slabs and hot-rolling the thin slabs to form a hot strip,<br>
also allows working steps to be dispensed with in the<br>
production of hot strips according to the invention, as for<br>
example the reheating of the slabs and pre-rolling.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that dispensing with the<br>
according working steps influences the material state in<br>
the various production phases. This sometimes differs<br>
considerably from that achieved in the conventional<br>
production of hot strip in which at the beginning the<br>
cooled slab is reheated. In particular it is the<br>
macroliquations and the solution and precipitation state<br>
which differentiates hot strips produced according to the<br>
invention from those produced conventionally. In addition,<br>
the forming process during the hot-rolling takes place<br>
during continuous in-line casting and rolling in favourable<br>
thermal conditions. Thus, the rolling passes can. be applied<br>
with higher degrees of deformation and the deformation<br>
conditions can be used in a targeted manner to control the<br>
structure development.<br>
In the use of continuous casting and rolling in the hot<br>
strip according to the invention, the phosphorous content<br>
is preferably limited to less than 0.08 % by weight in<br>
order to achieve adequate casting properties.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter with the aid of<br>
embodiments. In the graph, the curve of the orientation<br>
distribution function (orientation density) is plotted for<br>
three examples over the angle ?. "?" is one of the<br>
eulerian angles which describe the relative position of<br>
the crystal coordination and sample coordination system.<br>
Special positions are simultaneously plotted: (001) ,<br>
(112) , (111)  and others. To determine the<br>
properties of an example for a hot strip WbF, according to<br><br>
the invention and two comparison examples for hot strips<br>
Wbv1 and WbV2 not according to the invention, a steel with<br>
(in % by weight or ppm by weight) 
0.050% P, 1.3% Si, 0.12% A1, 0.01% Si and as the remainder<br>
Fe and impurities was melted.<br>
In the case of the hot strip Wbv1 manufactured for<br>
comparison, the melted steel is cast to form a slab, which<br>
is then cooled in a conventional manner, reheated, pre-<br>
rolled and hot-rolled to an end thickness of 2.5 mm. The<br>
hot strip Wbv1 thus obtained, for an orientation angle ? of<br>
0° to 20°, had an orientation thickness of the a fibre<br>
determined in the strip centre, of at least 4, while the<br>
orientation thickness for angles O of more than 20° was<br>
regularly less than 3. The value of the ratio I112/I001 of<br>
the intensity I112 of the position (112)  to the<br>
intensity I110 of the position (001)  of the a fibre<br>
was accordingly likewise below 0.1 like the value of the<br>
ratio I111/I001 of the intensity I111 of the component (111)<br> to the intensity I110 of the component (001) .<br>
The curve of the orientation density over the angle ? is<br>
shown in the graph for the hot strip Wbv1 serving for<br>
comparison as a dotted line.<br>
The high density in the region of small angles and the low<br>
density in the region of large angles prove that the hot<br>
strip WbV1 was in a hardened state in which it firstly has<br>
to be subjected to an expensive cold-rolling and after-<br>
treatment in order to be able to be used as a NO electrical<br>
sheet.<br><br>
In order to produce the hot strip WbV2 also manufactured<br>
for comparison, the same steel is firstly cast in a<br>
continuous casting and rolling plant to form a thin slab<br>
which was then hot-rolled also "in-line" in a plurality of<br>
passes to a hot strip end thickness of 3 mm.<br>
The hot strip WbV2 thus obtained, for an orientation angle<br>
? of 0° to 20°, like the hot strip WbV1, had an orientation<br>
density of the a fibre determined in the strip centre of at<br>
least 4, while the orientation density for angles ? of<br>
more than 20° was regularly significantly less than 3. The<br>
value of the ratio I112/I001 of the intensity I112 oE the<br>
position (112)  to the intensity I110 of the position<br>
(001)  of the a fibre was 0.2, while the value of the<br>
ratio I111/I001 of the intensity I111 of the position (111)<br> to the intensity I110 of the position (001)  only<br>
reached 0.06.<br>
The curve of the orientation density over the angle ? is<br>
shown in the graph as a dash-dot line for the hot strip<br>
WbV2 serving as a comparison.<br>
In the case of the hot strip WbV2 the high density in the<br>
region of smaller angles, and the low density in the region<br>
of large angles, also proves that the hot strip WbV2 was in<br>
a hardened state in which it firstly had to be subjected to<br>
an extensive cold-rollinc and after-treatment in order to<br>
be able to be used as NO electrical sheet.<br>
The hot strip WbE according to the invention is also<br>
produced from the same steel as the hot strip Wbyl<br>
manufactured for comparison. For this purpose, the relevant<br>
steel is also cast in a continuous casting and rolling<br><br>
plant to form a thin slab which is then also hot-rolled<br>
"in-line" in a plurality of passes. In contrast to the hot<br>
strip Wbv2, the end thickness of the hot strip was only<br>
1.04 mm, however.<br>
The hot strip WbE thus obtained for all orientation angles<br>
? in the range of 0° to 60°, had an orientation density of<br>
the a fibre determined in the strip centre of at least 4.<br>
The orientation density only dropped to below 3 in the<br>
angle range of more than 60°. The value of the ratio<br>
I112/I001 of the intensity I112 of the position (112)  to<br>
the intensity I110 of the component (001)  of the a<br>
fibre was at a high level, namely 0.81. In the same way,<br>
the value of the ratio T111/I001 of the intensity I111 of the<br>
position (111)  to the intensity I110 of the position<br>
(001)  reached a high level, namely 0.54.<br>
The curve of the orientation density over the angle ? is<br>
shown as a solid line in the graph for the hot strip WbE<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The high orientation densities up to an angle of 60° and<br>
the high intensities of the component (112)  and (111)<br> proves that the hot strip according to the invention<br>
is in a substantially partially softened state.<br><br><br>
