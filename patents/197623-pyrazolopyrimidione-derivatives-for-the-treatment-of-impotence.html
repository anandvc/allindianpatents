				<td>PYRAZOLOPYRIMIDINONE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPOTENCE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the following formula 1, their preparation method and pharmaceutical compositions containing the said derivatives. The compounds have efficacy on the treatment of impotence, one of male sexual dysfunctions with the side effects reduced.<br>
FORMULA 1<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Wherein,<br>
Ri represents hydrogen, alkyl group of C1-C6, fluoroalkyl group of C1-C3, or cycloalkyl group of C3-C6;<br>
R2 represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of C2-C6 ,  fluoroalkyl group of C1-C3,  or<br>
cycloalkyl group of C3-C6;<br>
R3 represents substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of C1-C6, fluoroalkyl group of C1-C6, cycloalkyl group of C3-C6, alkenyl group of C3-C6, or alkynyl group of C3-C6; and<br>
R4 represents substituted or unsubstituted and linear or branched alkyl group of C1-C10, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group of C1-C9, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group of C3-C6, substituted or unsubstituted benzene, or substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle selected from the group consisting of pyridine, isoxazole, thiazole, pyrimidine, indan, benzthiazole, pyrazole, thiadiazole, oxazole, piperidine, morpholine, imidazole, pyrrolidine, thienyl, triazole, pyrrole and furyl ring.<br>
In case of R2, R3 and R4 being substituted, the substituent is alkyl group of C1-C10, cycloalkyl group of C3-C6, halogen, fluoroalkyl group of Ci-Ce, alkyloxy group of C1-C10, substituted or unsubstituted benzene, or substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle selected from the group consisting of pyridine, isoxazole, thiazole, pyrimidine, indan, benzthiazole, pyrazole, thiadiazole, oxazole, piperidine, morpholine,  imidazole,  pyrrolidine,<br>
thienyl, triazole, pyrrole and furyl ring.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 may exist in tautomeric equilibrium represented by the following reaction scheme 1.<br>
REACTION SCHEME 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>

centers  and thus	they can  exist  as  enantiomers.  The<br>
present  invention	includes both mixtures  and  separate<br>
individual isomers.<br>
Male erectile dysfunction is one of the most common sexual  dysfunctions  in  men.     Although  erectile dysfunction can be primarily psychogenic in origin,  it often accompanies  chronic  illnesses,  such as  diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, and a variety of neurological diseases. Its prevalence is strongly related<br>
to age, with a estimated prevalence of 2% at age 40 years rising to 25-30% by age of 65. Although no data are available on the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men aged over 75, it is probably over 50%.<br>
Various treatment options for erectile dysfunction are available, such as counseling, hormonal therapy, self-injection or transurethral application of vasodilator agents, vacuum devices, prosthesis implantation, and venous/arterial surgery. However, these therapeutic options have several limitations such as side effects, high-cost and low efficacy. Therefore it has called for research efforts to develop new, high effective and simple to use treatment methods, potentially oral medication.<br>
Recently, sildenafil has been developed as a therapeutic agent for male erectile dysfunction by oral administration. Sildenafil is the first in a new class of drugs known as inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme distributed specifically in corpus cavernosal tissues and induces relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle cells, so that blood flow to the penis is enhanced, leading to an erection. Sildenafil has shown a response rate of around 80% in men with erectile dysfunction of<br>
organic cause.<br>
On the other hand, USP 3,939,161 discloses that 1,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives exhibit anticonvulsant and sedative activiity, and also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and gastric antisecretory activity; EP 201,188 discloses that 5-substituted pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives have effects of antagonizing adenosine receptor and of inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes and can be used for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure or cardiac insufficiency; EP 463,756, EP 526,004, WO 93/6,104 and WO 93/7,149 disclose that pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives which inhibit c-GMP phosphodiesterase more selectively than c-AMP phosphodiesterase have efficacy on cardiovascular disorders such as angina pectoris, hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis, chronic asthma, etc.; and WO 94/28,902, WO 96/16,644, WO 94/16,657 and WO 98/49,166 disclose that the known inhibitors of c-GMP phosphodiesterase including the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the above mentioned patents can be used for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction.<br>
We, the inventors of the present invention, have investigated to develop the improved therapeutic agent for impotence and synthesized new pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives which have better potency for the treatment of impotence than that of sildenafil, based on the mechanism of inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme. The selectivity over phosphodiesterase-6 distributed in retina and phosphodiesterase-3 distributed in heart, of the compounds of the present invention, is much more improved, to reduce the side effects. The solubility and the metabolism in the liver, which are very important factor affecting the rate of the absorption when administered orally, of the compounds of the present invention is much more improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives represented by formula 1 and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide    preparation    method    of     the     said<br>
pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of impotence which contain the said pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts as an active ingredient.<br>

The pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of formula 1 according to the present invention have more prominent efficacy on the treatment of impotence than sildenafil, an already established therapeutic agent for impotence, based on the mechanism of inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme. The selectivities for phosphodiesterase-6 and phosphcdiesterase-3, of the compounds according to the present invention, are much better than those of sildenafil, reducing the side effects such as visual disorders or cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, the solubility in water at pH=2 &amp; 5 is much more improved and the metabolism in rat liver is noticeably decreased in some of the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the present invention. Therefore the probability of better absorption and better in vivo effect can be expected when administered orally compared with sildenafil and the dose of the compound may be reduced.<br>
Practically and presently preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrative as shown in the following examples.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, on consideration of this disclosure, may make modification and improvements within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>

As a result, the usefulness of the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the present invention was demonstrated by their higher penile erection index than sildenafil, presently used for the treatment of impotence by oral administration.<br><experiment> Test for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE 5) activity<br>
In order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 5 activity, of the compounds of formula 1, the following<br><br>
test was carried out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme (PDE 5) was separated from human corpus cavernosal tissues. About 3 g of this tissue was homogenized with 12 ml of Hepes buffer (20 mM Hepes, 250 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.2) at 4 °C. The solution was filtered with double-layered gauze and centrifuged (100,000 xg) for 60 min at 4 CC. The supernatant was filtered with 0.2 um filter paper and separated by HPLC (Mono Q anion exchange column) with concentration gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl to elute PDE isozymes. The enzyme activity was measured on the each column fraction by the following process to separate PDE 5 fraction and the inhibition for PDE 5 of the compounds of formula 1 was measured  using the fraction.<br>
To 1.5 ml tube were added 100 ul of reaction mixture (15 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) and the appropriate amount of PDE 5 fraction and PDE inhibitor and the mixture was mixed well. To this solution was added [3H]-cAMP or [3H]-cGMP (500 nM, 2 uCi/ml), the mixture was reacteo in the incubator of 30 °C for about 1 hour and the reaction was quenched by putting the tube into boiling water for about 45 seconds to 2 min. Then the tube was chilled in ice bath for about 5 min. To this tube was<br>
added snake venom (1 mg/ml, 100 ul) or 5'-nucleotidase<br>
(0.1 unit/tube) and the mixture was reacted in incubator<br>
of 37 "C for 10 min and chilled in ice bath. 3 times<br>

As a result, it was demonstrated that the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the present invention inhibit the phosphodiesterase-5 activity in a concentration of 0.1-50 ng/ml (IC50) and therefore show prominent efficacy on the treatment of impotence in oral administration.<br><experiment> Test for phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE 6) activity<br>
The inhibitor for PDE 5 is known to additionally inhibit PDE 6 distributed in retina, isozyme of PDE 5, and which causes visual disorders. Therefore in order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 6, of the compounls of formula 1, the following test was carried<br>
out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-6 enzyme (PDE 6) was separated from the retina of bullfrogs. The retina was added to Ringer's soluticr. (105 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl:, 1 mM CaCli,<br>
    5 mM Glucose, 5 mM NaHC03, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5-7.6) containing 6% Percoll and the solution was shaken. Then the cells were disrupted with syringe pressure and centrifuged (about 10,000 rpm) instantaneously to remove the piqment, and the resulting fraction was used as PDE 6<br>
    fraction.<br>
1C ul of reaction mixture (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, '!. 5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5) was dispensed into each well of microplate, to which were added 10 ul of fraction of PDE 6  and 10 ul of PDE inhibitor and the solution was<br>
    mixed veil. 10 ul of trypsin (about 20-100 ug/ml) was added to the solution, the mixture was reacted in incubator of 4 °C for 1 hour to activate PDE 6 and the reacticr. was quenched by adding 10 ul of soybean trypsin inhibitor  (6 times higher concentration to the trypsin<br>
    used). To this mixture was added 10 ul of cyclic nucleotide (generally, 10 mM cGMP was added) and approphate amount of snake venom or 5'-nucleotidase, and the mixture was reacted in incubator of 37 °C for 20 min.<br>
The inorganic phosphate produced by this reaction was measures in absorbance at 700-750 ran by adding 150 ul of molybdate solution (0.4 N H2S04, 0.2% ammonium molybdate, 2% sodium dodesyl sulfate, 2% ascorbic acid) prepared immediately before.<br>

As shown in the results, since the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for PDE 6 is higher than for phosphcdiesterase-5 in some of the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives, the probability of visual disorders caused by the compounds of the present invention can be much reduced compared with sildenafil.<br><experiment>  Test  for  phosphodiesterase-3  (PDE  3) activity<br>
The inhibitor for PDE 5 may inhibit PDE 3 distributed in hearr., isozyme of PDE 5, additionally, which may cause side effects in cardiovascular system. Therefore in order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 3, of the compounds of formula 1, the following test was carried out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-3 enzyme (PDE 3) was separated from platelets of a rabbit. About 60 ml of blood was collected from a puncture of the abdominal artery of a rabbit in heparir.ized syringes. Platelet-rich plasma was harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 450 Xg and further centrifuged for 15 min at 1,200 Xg to precipitate the<br>
platelets. The platelets were resuspended in homogenizing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4), homogenized at 4 C and ultrasonicated (30 sec/ml). The homogenized solution was centrifuged (105,000 Xg) for 1 hr at 4 °C to obtain che supernatant in which PDE was dissolved. The supernatant was separated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (Whatman DE52 bead) by using eluent (50 mM Tris-HCl, 3.75 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.0) with concentration gradient of 0-1 M sodium acetate to elute PDE isozymes. The PDE activity was measured on the each column fraction by the following process to separate PDE 3 fraction and the inhibition for PDE 3 of the compounds of formula 1 was measured by using the fraction.<br>
T'" 1.5 ml tube containing 100 ul of reaction mixture (15 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) were added appropriate amount of PDE 3 fraction and PDE inhibitor and the solution was mixed well. After [3H]-cAMP or [3H]-cGMP (500 nM, 2 uCi/ml) was added, the mixture was reacted in incubator of 30 °C for about 1 hour and the reaction was quenched by putting the tube into boiling water for about 45 seconds to 2 min. The tube was chilled in ice bach for about 5 min. To this tube was added snake venom µl mg/ml, 100 ul) or 5'-nucleotidase (0.1 unit/tube)<br>
and the mixture was reacted in incubator of 37 °C for 10 min and chilled in ice bath. 3 times volume of methanol to the resin was added to the anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad resin, AG1-X2, 200-400 mesh) which had been already washed with 0.5 N HC1, H20, 0.5 N NaOH, H20, 0.5 N HC1 and H20 in order and adjusted to pH 5.

Also in hematology, serum chemistry parameters and macroscopic observation, no drug-related changes were observed. As a result all the compour. ;ls tested did not show toxicity in rats up to 1 g/kg, end the lethal dose (LD^,,) of oral administration was determined to be over 1 g/kg in rats.<br><experiment> Solubility in buffer solution in pH=2&amp;5<br>
In order to evaluate the solubilities in water of the compour :1s of formula 1 in pH=2 and 5 buffer solutions, the experiment as below was performed.<br>
According to that defined in the Korea Pharmacopoeia, citrate-HC1 buffer (pH 2) and citrate-NaOH buffer (pH 5) solutions were added to the powdered compounds of formula 1, respectively. After subsequent severe shaking for 30 sec every 5 min in 20 _ 5 °C for 30 min, the level of compouris in the filtrate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography.  The results were shown in Table 6.<br>
TABLE 6<br><br>
(Table Removed) As shown in the results, the solubilities in water of the compounds according to the present invention are very high.  The  solubilities  in  water  at  pH  2  and  5  of<br>
sildenafil were 1585 and 480 ug/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the solubilities in water of the compounds of the present invention, preferrably of exmaples 56, 58, 60, 62 and 68, were 3722-5356 and 4923-14758 ug/ml at pH 2 and 5, respectively. That is, the solubilities in water of the compounds according to the present invention has been increased to maximum 3.3 and 30.7 times compared with those cf sildenafil at pH 2 and 5, respectively.<br>
The solubility in water, in particular in acidic range of pH, of the compound is the very important factor determ.1 r.ing the absorption of the compound in oral administration. Therefore, the better absorption of the compour. is according to the present invention are expected in the light of the higer solubility of the compounds in acidic range of pH. Also they have an advantage of reducing the dose in oral administration.<br><experiment> Metabolism in rat liver<br>
I: order to evaluate the extent of metabolism of the compounds of formula 1, the metabolism in rat liver was studied as below similar to the reported method (C. L. Litterist, E. G. Mimnaugh, R. I. Reagan and T. G. Gram.,<br>
Drug, ketabol. Disposit., 1975, 3, 259-265). In short, the disappearance of compounds after incubation in 9,000 Xg superncv;ant fraction of rat liver homogenate in the present -?• of NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleetide phosphate) was evaluated.<br>
First, Sprague-Dawley rat (Korea Experiment Animals, SPF) 1 ' ver was isolated after perfusion through portal vein with 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 using tissue homogenizer at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 9,000 Xg for 20 min, the supernatants were collected.<br>
The compound stock solution was spiked (10 ug/ml) into each of the eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of the mixed solution composing 1 volume of supernatants and 2 volumes of generating solution. The generating solution contains 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 50 mM nicotiramide and 5 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. After vortex-mixing, each test tube was incubated in a water bath kept at 37 °C. After 1 hr, was added acetonitrile to the reaction mixture and centrifuged. 100 ul of aliquot of the supernatant was sampled from each test tiioe for measuring the remnants by high performance liquid chromatography. The results were shown in Table 7.<br>
TABLE 7<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
A shown in the results, the extent of metabolism of the cor pounds in rat liver is noticeably decreased. The remnant of some of the compounds in liver was over 50% while that of sildenafil in liver was about 35%. In particular, the remnant (%) of some of the compounds of the present invention was over 80% and 95% at maximum. That is, it was confirmed that some of the compounds of the present invention were hardly metabolized in liver.<br>
The level of metabolism of the compound in liver is anothei important factor determining the bioavailability<br>
and the in vivo effect, accompanied with the solubility in acidic conditions. The low remnant(%) requires the increas of the dose. Therefore the higher bioavailability and the better in vivo effect of the compounds of the present invention are expected in the light of the less metabolism in liver. Also the compounds of the present invention have an advantage of reducing the dose in oral administration.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
