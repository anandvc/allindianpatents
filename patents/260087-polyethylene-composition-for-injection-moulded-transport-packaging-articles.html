				<td>Polyethylene Composition for Injection Moulded Transport Packaging<br>
Articles<br>
The present invention relates to a polyethylene composition for injection moulded articles, in particular for transport packaging, houseware and thin wall packaging applications. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for the production of said composition, an injection moulded article comprising said composition and to the use of said composition for the production of an injection moulded article.<br>
Injection moulding may be used to make a wide variety of articles including articles having relatively complex shapes and a range of sizes. Injection moulding is, for instance, suited to the manufacture of articles used in transportation packaging which often have a particular form suited to the objects which they carry. Examples of such articles include boxes, bins, pallets, pails, trays and crates. Furthermore, injection moulding is widely used to produce articles for houseware applications, such as sink bowls and drainers, mixing bowls, food containers and buckets, as well as to produce thin wall packaging articles such as open top plastic containers for frozen or fresh food or non-food applications like paint, adhesives, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Still further, injection moulding, for instance, is suited for the manufacture of articles used as caps and closure for food and drink applications, such as for bottles containing flat water.<br>
Injection moulding is a moulding process in which a polymer is melted and then filled into a mould by injection. During initial injection, a high pressure is used and the polymer melt is compressed. Thus, upon injection into the mould the polymer melt initially expands or "relaxes" to fill the<br><br>
mould. The mould, however, is at a lower temperature than the polymer melt therefore as the polymer melt cools, shrinkage tends to occur. To compensate for this effect, further polymer melt may be slowly injected into the mould. Thereafter the polymer melt is cooled further to enable the moulded article to be removed from the mould without causing deformation.<br>
An important property of the polymer to be injection moulded is therefore its rheology. Rheology is a measure of non-Newtonian melt flow and it is crucial in injection moulding that the polymer melt have a flow within certain limits to ensure that the final product properties are desirable. For example, the flow of the polymer melt must be sufficiently high to enable it to flow to all areas of the mould and thus to form an article of the desired shape. Also, the higher the flow of the polymer melt the greater the speed at which it can be injected into the mould and the shorter the processing time.<br>
Polyethylenes conventionally used for injection moulding are such having a narrow molecular weight distribution to reach the desired impact strength and stiffness, on the sacrifice of good flow properties. Thus, for improving the flow properties, polyethylenes with broader molecular weight distribution have been made or with lower average molecular weight (higher MFR2). However, polymers having broad molecular weight distributions tend to yield products having poorer stiffness and poor impact properties and polymers with lower molecular weight tend to yield products having poor impact strength and poor environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) properties. Thus, the performance of injection moulded articles made of such polymers in applications such as packaging, where impact strength and stiffness are important, is reduced.<br><br>
One way in which this problem has been addressed is to heat the moulding polymer to a higher temperature prior to injection. Since flow increases with increasing temperature, this allows polymers having poorer flow properties, but better stiffness and impact strength, to be used in an injection moulding process. The disadvantage of this strategy, however, is that the polymer melt needs to cool for a much longer period of time following filling into the mould in order to reach a temperature at which the moulded article can be removed from the mould without deformation. During this extended cooling tune shrinkage is much more likely to occur. Also many fewer articles can be produced per unit of time and productivity is significantly decreased.<br>
There remains a need therefore for a polymer composition suitable for use in injection moulding, in particular for transport packaging and houseware applications, which provides a combination of. on the one hand, superior flow properties which allow for easy processing even at low temperatures and hence allow for increased productivity (output), and, on the other hand, excellent mechanical properties including excellent impact strength, stiffness, low creep, high durability, and low shrinkage. Furthermore, the composition should also exhibit a satisfactory degree of environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR).<br>
It is emphasized that although these properties at least in part are contrary to each other, e.g. high flow and good impact strength, to provide a polyethylene composition for injection moulding, each of them must be achieved.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that by providing a polyethylene composition having a particular molecular weight distribution so that a specific relation between shear thinning index or spiral flow and melt flow<br><br>
rate of the composition is achieved, a composition which not only has excellent Theological, i.e. flow, properties but also good mechanical properties such as impact strength and stiffness after injection moulding is furnished.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides in a first embodiment a polyethylene composition wherein<br>
(i)      the composition has an MFR2 of 0.1 to 100 g/lOmin,<br>
(ii)     the shear thinning index SHZ(i)10o) and the log MFR2 of the composition satisfy the following relation:<br>
SHI) -5.5 log MFR2 [g/10min]/(g/10min) + 9.66, and<br>
(iii)    the composition has a Charpy impact strength (23Â°C) of 3 kJ/m2 or more.<br>
Preferably, in the composition according to the first embodiment the spiral flow and the MFR2 of the composition satisfy the following relation:<br>
Spiral flow(10oo bar) [cm] ^ MFR2 [g/10min]cm/(g/10min) + 45.<br>
The present invention in a second embodiment provides a polyethylene composition wherein<br>
(i)      the composition has an MFR2 of 0.1 to 100 g/lOmin, and<br>
(ii)     the spiral flow and the MFR2 of the composition satisfy the following relation:<br>
Spiral flow(10oo bar) [cm] MFR2 [g/10min]cm/(g/10min) + 45,<br>
(iii)    the composition has a Charpy impact strength (23Â°C) of 3 kJ/m2 or more.<br><br>
It has been found that the polyethylene compositions according to the invention provide a improved material suited for injection moulding, in particular for transport packaging and houseware applications, which combines very good flow properties with excellent mechanical properties, such as high impact strength and stiffness. At the same time, the compositions according to the invention exhibit good ESCR and the injection moulded articles produced therewith show low warpage. Due to the excellent flow properties of the compositions, a higher throughput in injection moulding can be reached, more complex moulds can be used and/or lower moulding temperatures can be used leading i.a. to decreased degradation of the polymer.<br>
By ethylene copolymer is meant a polymer the majority by weight of which derives from ethylene monomer units. The comonomer contribution preferably is up to 10% by mol, more preferably up to 5 % by mol, and may derive from other copolymerisable monomers, generally C3-20. especially C3.10. comonomers, particularly singly or multiply ethylenically unsaturated comonomers, in particular olefins such as propene, but-1-ene. hex-1-ene. oct-1-ene, 4-methyl-pent-l-ene etc.<br>
In the following, preferred features for both embodiments of the polyethylene composition according to the invention are described.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises<br>
(A)	a first ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br>
(B)	a second ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction,<br>
wherein<br>
(iv)    fraction   (A)  has   a   lower   average   molecular  weight  than fraction (B),<br><br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights and molecular weight distributions for the fractions, is referred to as "multimodal". Accordingly, in this sense the compositions of the invention are multimodal polyethylenes. The prefix "multi" relates to the number of different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of. Thus, for example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called "bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process, utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each reactor, the polymer fractions produced in the different reactors will each have their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into the molecular weight distribution curve for the total resulting polymer product, usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br>

Most preferably, fraction (B) is a copolymer.

Preferred ethylene copolymers employ alpha-olefins (e.g. C3.]2 alpha-olefins) as comonomers. Examples of suitable alpha-olefins include but-1-ene, hex-1-ene and oct-1-ene. But-1-ene is an especially preferred comonomer.<br>

Where herein features of fractions (A) and/or (B) of the composition of the present invention are given, these values are generally valid for the cases in which they can be directly measured on the respective fraction, e.g. when the fraction is separately produced or produced in the first stage of a multistage process.<br>
However, the composition may also be and preferably is produced in a multistage process wherein e.g. fractions (A) and (B) are produced in subsequent stages. In such a case, the properties of the fractions produced in the second step (or further steps) of the multistage process can either be inferred from polymers, which are separately produced in a single stage by applying identical polymerisation conditions (e.g. identical temperature, partial pressures of the reactants/diluents, suspension medium, reaction time) with regard to the stage of the multistage process in which the fraction is produced, and by using a catalyst on which no previously produced polymer is present. Alternatively, the properties of the fractions produced in a higher stage of the multistage process may also be calculated, e.g. in accordance with B. Hagstrom, Conference on Polymer Processing (The Polymer Processing Society), Extended Abstracts and Final Programme, Gothenburg, August 19 to 21, 1997, 4:13.<br>
Thus, although not directly measurable on the multistage process products, the properties of the fractions produced in higher stages of such a multistage process can be determined by applying either or both of the above methods. The skilled person will be able to select the appropriate method.<br><br>
A multimodal (e.g. bimodal) polyethylene as hereinbefore described may be produced by mechanical blending two or more polyethylenes (e.g. monomodal polyethylenes) having differently centred maxima in their MWDs. Thus viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a polyethylene composition as hereinbefore described comprising blending two or more polyethylenes (e.g. monomodal polyethylenes) having differently centred maxima in their molecular weight distributions. Blending may be carried out in any conventional blending apparatus.<br>
The monomodal polyethylenes required for blending may be available commercially or may be prepared using any conventional procedure known to the skilled man in the art. Each of the polyethylenes used in a blend and/or the final polymer composition may have the properties hereinbefore described for the lower molecular weight component, higher molecular weight component and the composition, respectively.<br>
The polyethylene composition according the invention in the preferred embodiment where the composition comprises<br>
(A)	a first ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br>
(B)	a second ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction,<br>
wherein fraction (A) has a lower average molecular weight than fraction (B), preferably is produced so that at least one of fractions (A) and (B), preferably (B), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
Further preferred, one of the fractions (A) and (B) of the polyethylene composition, preferably fraction (A), is produced in a slurry reaction, preferably in a loop reactor, and one of the fractions (A) and (B), preferably fraction (B), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br><br>
Preferably, the multimodal polyethylene composition may be produced by polymerisation using conditions which create a multimodal (e.g. bimodal) polymer product, e.g. using a catalyst system or mixture with two or more different catalytic sites, each site obtained from its own catalytic site precursor, or using a two or more stage, i.e. multistage, polymerisation process with different process conditions in the different stages or zones (e.g. different temperatures, pressures, polymerisation media, hydrogen partial pressures, etc).<br>
Preferably, the multimodal (e.g. bimodal) composition is produced by a multistage ethylene polymerisation, e.g. using a series of reactors, with optional comonomer addition preferably in only the reactor(s) used for production of the higher/highest molecular weight component(s) or differing comonomers used in each stage. A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation process in which a polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced by producing each or at least two polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction stage, usually with different reaction conditions in each stage, in the presence of the reaction product of the previous stage which comprises a polymerisation catalyst. The polymerisation reactions used in each stage may involve conventional ethylene homopolymerisation or copolymerisation reactions, e.g. gas-phase, slurry phase, liquid phase polymerisations, using conventional reactors, e.g. loop reactors, gas phase reactors, batch reactors etc. (see for example WO97/44371 and W096/18662).<br>
Polymer compositions produced in a multistage process are also designated as "in-situ"-blends.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that fractions (A) and (B) of the polyethylene composition are produced in different stages of a multistage process.<br><br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in which, preferably, fraction (B) is produced.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (B) is produced in a subsequent stage in the presence of fraction (A) which has been produced in a previous stage.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, olefin polymers, such as multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process comprising two or more reactors connected in series. As instance of this prior art, mention may be made of EP 517 868, which is hereby incorporated by way of reference in its entirety, including all its preferred embodiments as described therein, as a preferred multistage process for the production of the polyethylene composition according to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the main polymerisation stages of the multistage process for producing the composition according to the invention are such as described in EP 517 868, i.e. the production of fractions (A) and (B) is carried out as a combination of slurry polymerisation for fraction (A)/gas-phase polymerisation for fraction (B). The slurry polymerisation is preferably performed in a so-called loop reactor. Further preferred, the slurry polymerisation stage precedes the gas phase stage.<br>

Experimental and Examples<br>
1.       Definitions and measurement methods<br>
a)	Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 Â°C. The column set was calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the Mark Rowings constant K: 9.54*10'5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92*10~4 and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end of the "population".<br>
b)	Density<br><br>
All densities are measured according to ISO 1183/D.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate/Flow Rate Ratio<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowabiliry, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190Â°C and may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 4cg (MFR?), 5 kg (MFR5) or 21.6 kg (MFR2]).<br>
d)	Shear Thinning Index SHI<br>
Dynamic rheological measurements were carried out with a rheometer, namely Rheometrics RDA-II QC, on compression moulded samples under nitrogen atmosphere at 190 Â°C using 25 mm diameter plates and plate geometry 1.2 mm gap. The oscillatory shear experiments were done within the linear viscosity range of strain at frequencies from 0.05 to 300 rad/s (ISO 6721-1).<br>
The values of storage modulus (G'). loss modulus (G") complex modulus (G*) and complex viscosity (eta*) were obtained as a function of frequency (omega). Eta(100 rad/s) is used as abbreviation for the complex viscosity at 100 rad/sec shear rate.<br>
Shear thinning index (SHI), which is correlating with MWD and is independent of Mw, was calculated according to Heino ("Rheological characterization of polyethylene fractions" Heino, EX., Lehtinen, A., Tanner J., Seppala, J., Neste Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Theor. Appl. Rheol., Proc. Int. Congr. Rheol, 11th (1992), 1, 360-362, and "The influence of<br><br>
molecular structure on some rheological properties of polyethylene". Heino, E.L., Borealis Polymers Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Annual Transactions of the Nordic Pvheology Society, 1995.)<br>
SHI value is obtained by calculating the complex viscosities eta(i) and eta(10o) at a constant shear stress of 1 kPa and 100 kPa, respectively. The shear thinning index SHI(i/ioo&gt; is defined as the ratio of the two viscosities and<br>
The definitions and measurement conditions are also described in detail on page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br>
e)	Charpy impact strength<br>
Charpy impact strength was determined according to ISO 179:2000 on V-notched samples at 23 Â°C (Charpy impact strength (23 Â°C)) and -20 Â°C (Charpy impact strength (-20Â°C))<br>
f)	Spiral flow<br>
Spiral Test is carried out using an Engel ES330/65 cc90 injection moulding apparatus with a spiral mould and pressure of 600, 1000 or 1400 bar<br>
screw diameter: 35 mm<br>
max. piston displacement: 150 cm3<br>
spec, injection pressure: 600, 1000. or 1400 bar<br>
tool form: oval form; provided by Axxicon; thickness 2 mm, breadth: 5 mm<br>
temperature in pre-chamber and die:	230Â°C<br>
temperature in zone 2/zone 3/zone 4/zone 5: 2300C/230Â°C/2250C/200Â°C<br>
injection cycle: injection time including holding:  10s<br><br>
cooling time:	15 s<br>
injection   pressure:    Follows   from   the   predetermined   length   of   the<br>
testing material.<br>
dwell pressure = injection pressure screw speed: 30 rprn system pressure: 10 bar<br>
metering path: should be chosen so that the screw stops 20 mm before its final position at the end of the dwell pressure.<br>
tool temperature: 40Â°C<br>
The spiral flow length can be determined immediately after the injection operation.<br>
g)       Shrinkage and warpage<br>
Shrinkage   and  warpage measurements  were performed   on   tool   boxes<br>
injection moulded on Nestal Nl570/300 MPS.<br>
melt temperature:	230Â°C<br>
   injection speed:	100 mrn/s<br>
backpressure:	100 bar<br>
tool temperature:	30Â°C<br>
cooling time:	15 sec<br>
Tool boxes are boxes with dimensions: width: 20cm; length: 40 cm; height:   10 cm.<br>
Tool boxes for warpage measurements were made by holding pressure of 550 bar and holding pressure time of 6 sec.<br>
Warpage is defined in percentage as:<br><br>
warpage % = (a - b)*100/a<br>
wherein a is the breadth of the tool box at an edge of the box. and b is the breadth of the tool box at the middle of the box<br>
Tool boxes for shrinkage are made by a variable holding pressure until the tool box is 325 gram. Holding pressure time is 12 sec.<br>
Shrinkage can be measured in both flow direction and in cross direction, h)      Tensile properties<br>
Tensile properties were measured on injection moulded samples according to ISO 527-2:1993. Tensile modulus was measured at a speed of 1 mm/min.<br>
2.       Examples<br>
Polyethylene compositions 1 to 5 according to the invention were produced using the following procedure:<br>
Into a 500 dmj loop reactor, operated at 95 Â°C and 56 bar, was introduced 34 kg/hour ethylene, 106 kg/hour propane, 28 g/hour hydrogen and the polymerisation catalyst Lynx 200, a MgCl2 supported titanium containing catalyst available from Engelhard Corporation Pasadena, U.S.A., in a quantity such that PE production rate was 34 kg PE/hour.<br>
The polymer (containing the active catalyst) was separated from the reaction medium and transferred to a gas phase reactor, operated at 85 Â°C and 20 bar, where additional hydrogen, ethylene and 1-butene comonomer were added so as to produce a polyethylene at 50 kg/hour.<br>
The reaction conditions applied and the materials properties are listed in Tables I and II.<br><br>
(Table Removed)In Table II, in addition to compositions 1 to 5, three commercially available polyethylene compositions were evaluated: Comparative Example 6 :bimodal HDPE, Comparative Examples 7 and 8: unimodal HDPE.<br>
Test specimen (dog bones) were produced from all compositions by injection moulding on an Engel ES 330/65 cc90. The test specimen were made in accordance with ISO 294. The temperature of the melt was 210 Â°C, and the tool held a temperature of 40 Â°C. Holding pressure at 25 s and total cycle time of 45 s.<br>
(Table Removed)The data in Table II show that the composition of the invention has a much higher shear thinning index than conventional unimodal or bimodal HDPE used for injection moulding, but, at the same time, yields injection moulded articles with good mechanical properties. Accordingly, the composition hereinbefore described will be easier to injection mould and will facilitate high throughputs while yielding injection moulded products of high quality.<br>
Table II also shows that the HDPE described herein with an MFR2 value of about 5 g/10 min behaves in a spiral test like a conventional unimodal polyethylene having a MFR2 of about 12 g/10 min. This is advantageous in injection moulding since it enables a lower melting temperature to be used, hence the moulded article does not need to be cooled for so long in the mould prior to removal of the moulded article. Correspondingly, the number of moulded articles per unit time can be significantly increased, while, as stated, the good mechanical properties of the moulded articles are maintained.<br>
In order to measure how far the injection moulding temperature can be lowered for the compositions of the invention compared to a reference material, but still obtaining the same flow, spiral flow measurements were performed at different temperatures. The flow of the materials of Examples 2, 3 and that of Comparative Example 8, was measured after reducing the temperature from 230 Â°C in 5 Â°C intervals. The material of Example 3 at a temperature of 200 Â°C obtained the same flow as that of Comparative Example 8 at a temperature of 230 Â°C. The material of Example 2 at even a temperature of 170 Â°C obtained the same flow as that of Comparative Example 8 at a temperature of 230 Â°C.<br>
This comparison again shows impressively the improved flowability of the compositions of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
