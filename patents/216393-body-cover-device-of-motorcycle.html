Fig. 5 is a sectional view viewing a body cover on a side having a muffler from a rear side and a rear wheel 54 supported by a power unit 55 is arranged at center C in a direction of vehicle width. The power unit 55 is arranged to shift to one side of the rear wheel 54 and is installed in the forward and rearward direction of the vehicle body.<br>
In the meantime, a muffler 52 arranged to the power unit 55 is arranged to shift to a side opposed to the power unit 55 such that it does not interfere with the rear wheel 54.<br>
Meanwhile, the muffler 52 is arranged on an outer side of the rear wheel 54 to interpose a predetermined space therebetween in consideration of prevention of thermal influence on the rear wheel 54 and a body cover 51 is installed on an outer side of the muffler 52 by securing a predetermined space therebetween in consideration of prevention of thermal influence from the muffler.<br>
Therefore, the muffler 52 is arranged from one side of the rear wheel 54 in an outer side direction by interposing a space S2 therebetween, further, a portion of the body cover 51 in correspondence with the muffler 52 is arranged in an outer side direction from the muffler 52 by interposing a space SI therebetween.<br>
By the above-mentioned reason, the muffler 52 is arranged on one side of the rear wheel 54 and on an outer side of the rear wheel 54 in the vehicle width direction by interposing the space S2 and in respect of the body cover 51 constituting<br>
an outlook of the motorcycle, a portion thereof in correspondence with the muffler 52 is formed as a bulged portion 51a significantly bulging in the outer side direction of the vehicle width direction in comparison with other portions of the body cover for avoiding interference between the body cover 51 and the muffler 52 and avoiding thermal influence from the muffler' 52 as mentioned above.<br>
Further, numeral 53 designates a muffler protector arranged on the upper side of the muffler 52 and arranged with a gap between it and the bulged portion 51a of the body cover 51. The space SI is provided between the muffler 52 including the muffler protector 53 and the bulged portion 51a of the body cover 51 as mentioned above and the muffler 52 and the muffler protector 53 are disposed on an inner side of the bulged portion 51a of the body cover 51, holds the space SI therebetween and is moved upwardly and downwardly integrally with the swinging movement of the power unit 55 as shown by an arrow mark in the drawing.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a body cover structure of a motorcycle with a muffler (22) arranged on a lower side of a body cover (11) characterized in that the body cover (11) has a portion in correspondence with an upper side of a side portion of the muffler (22), and the portion of the body cover (11) has a chipped portion (1 Id) to which a muffler protector (123) made of steel is integrally attached.<br>
[Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The conventional body cover 51 is molded integrally by resin or the like to include the bulged portion 51a on the side having the muffler 52 and when the body cover 51 is formed of a left and right dividing type, in respect of a half body cover on one side (hereinafter, described as "body cover hair), a total of the body cover half is integrally molded to include the bulged portion 51a.<br>
In the meantime, the bulged portion 51a of the body cover 51 on the side having the muffler 52, is obliged to bulge to an outer side direction in comparison with other portions of the body cover owing to the reason.<br>
Accordingly, there is a possibility in which the bulged portion 51a is brought into contact with an obstacle in parking or in moving it by pushing it by the hand or the like. Further, in the case of parking, when the motorcycle is erroneously fallen down, the bulged portion 51a may be grounded, impaired, or destructed.<br>
In the case of a scooter type motorcycle, the body cover 51 constitutes directly outlook of the vehicle body and accordingly, impairment or destruction of the bulged portion 51a of the body cover 51 mentioned above is not preferable.<br>
Conventionally, when the bulged portion 51a is impaired or destructed as mentioned above, a total of the body cover or a total of the body cover half including the bulged portion 51a needs to interchange.<br>
When the total of the body cover or the total of the body cover half is interchanged, the interchanging operation becomes hard, a burden on a user in view of the cost is considerable and an improvement therefor is requested.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to resolve the problem, according to Claim 1, in a motorcycle arranged with a muffler on a lower side of<br>
a body cover, a portion of the body cover in correspondence with an upper side of a side portion of the muffler is integrally attached with a muffler protector separate from the body cover.<br>
According to Claim 1, a muffler protector constituting the portion of the side portion of the body cover in correspondence with the upper side of the side portion of the muffler can be integrated to constitute the portion of the body cover by constituting the body cover by a body separate from the side portion of the body cover. Accordingly, only the muffler protector constituting the one side portion of the body cover can be interchanged. That is, the total of the body cover or the total of the body cover half needs not to interchange.<br>

Fig. 3 shows a modified embodiment of the invention. According to the embodiment, only the structure of the muffler protector differs from that of the previous embodiment and the other constitution remains the same.  Therefore, inclusive of the constitution of the motorcycle, the same portions are attached with the same notations and a detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
According to the embodiment, the muffler protector made of resin is made of steel sheet and accordingly, a muffler guard is not installed at the outer surrounding of the muffler 22 and a heat shielding sheet is not installed on the rear face of the muffler protector.<br>
A detailed explanation will be given thereof as follows.<br>
The outer configuration of a muffler protector 123 in this embodiment constitute a shape the same as that of the muffler protector 23 or a shape similar thereto. In place of resin of the muffler protector 23 , the material is constituted by a pressed product of a steel sheet and a plurality of slits 124 ... for cooling are installed in parallel in the up and down direction.<br>
The muffler protector 123 is fitted to the chipped portion lid of the right side face portion lib of the rear cover 11 and a lower end portion 123a of the muffler protector 123 is disposed at a level equal to that of the lower end edge lie of the right side face portion lib of the rear cover.<br>
A main body portion 123b which is a middle portion of the muffler cover 12 3 except front and rear end portions thereof, is formed to bulge to the outer side in the vehicle width direction similar to the embodiment.<br>
Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view viewing a portion of attaching the muffler protector 123 from a rear face, the muffler 22 is arranged to shift from the rear wheel 8 to the outer side in the vehicle width direction by a space S6 on a side opposed to the power unit 5 and a main body portion 123b is arranged to shift from the muffler 22 on the outer side in the vehicle width direction interposing the space S5 on the outer side in the vehicle width direction.<br>
Further, the section of the rear face (front face) of the muffler protector 123 is constituted by a modified W-like shape where the main body portion 123b considerably hangs down to the lower side from the chipped portion lid.<br>
Explaining details of the section, an upper end portion of the main body portion 123b which hangs down from the chipped portion lid, is installed with a stepped portion 123c having a small width extended under the upper end portion to an inner side thereof and further installed with an erected portion 123d erected upwardly from the stepped portion 123c, and installed with a heat shielding plate portion 123e substantially in a shape of a horizontal eaves which is bent to the inner side from an upper end portion of the erected portion 123d and extended to the inner side.<br>
These respective portions are integrally formed by pressing or the like of a steel sheet or the like.<br>
The attaching operation of the muffler protector 123 is the same as above description in which the erected portion 123d is coupled to the plurality of boss portions lie ... by the fastening members 2 5 ... and is integrated to the right side face portion lib of the rear cover 11.<br>
Further, the substantially horizontal heat shielding portion 123e arranged above the muffler 22, is arranged above an upper limit of movement of the muffler 22 moving upwardly and downwardly as shown by an arrow mark and according to the muffler 22, a position designated by a bold line in Fig. 4 is a lower limit position and a position designated by an<br>
imaginary line is an upper limit position and the heat shielding portion 123e is arranged above the upper limit position of the muffler 22 with a space therebetween.<br>
Further, although according to the embodiment, the heat shielding portion 123e is installed above the muffler protector 123, a structure with no provision thereof may be used and in this case, the sectional shape of the muffler protector 123 becomes a shape the same as that of the muffler protector 23 made of resin in the previous embodiment or a shape similar thereto.<br>
In the meantime, an outer side face of the main body portion 123b of the muffler protector 123 is made of a steel sheet and accordingly, the outer side face is provided with heat resistance and accordingly, an amount of bulging to the outer side can be made smaller than that of the muffler protector 23 made of resin. Accordingly, the outer side face of the main body portion 123b may also be formed to a degree of substantially coinciding with an outer side face of the right side face portion lib of the rear cover 11 or bulging slightly to the outer side.<br>
As a result, the space S5 between the muffler protector 123 and the muffler 22 can be made smaller than the space S3 between the muffler protector 23 made of resin and the muffler 22 and the amount of bulging the muffler protector 123 to the outer side in the vehicle width direction can be made small.<br>
According to the embodiment, the space S5 between the<br>
muffler 22 and the main body portion 123b of the muffler protector 123 constituting a portion of the right side face portion lib of the rear cover 11 which is disposed on the outer side and the upper side of the muffler 22, can be made small since the muffler protector 123 is made of steel and the muffler 22 can be arranged as close to the muffler protector 123 as possible as mentioned above.<br>
The body cover 13 can be made proximate to the muffler 22, as a result, the width of this portion of the body cover 13 and accordingly, the width of the body cover 13 can be made considerably small and narrow in comparison with that in the conventional case and the vehicle width can be made as small and narrow as possible.<br>
In this way, there can be achieved compact formation of the outer configuration of a scooter type motorcycle in which the compact formation has been difficult in view of arranging the muffler 22 and in view of the width.<br>
 [Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention as described above, the following effect is achieved.<br>
According to Claim 1, in a motorcycle arranged with a muffler on a lower side of a body cover, a muffler protector separate from the body cover is integrally attached to a portion of the body cover in correspondence with an upper side of a side portion of the muffler.<br>
Therefore, according to the invention, the muffler protector constitutes a portion of the body cover and can be<br>
installed integrally with the body cover to fit in. Therefore, the promotion of appearance quality can be achieved as a total of a motorcycle.<br>
Further, according to the invention, a portion of the muffler protector constituting a portion of the body cover mostly projected in the vehicle width direction, can be formed by a member separate from the body cover, the structure is integrated with the body cover and accordingly, only the muffler protector can be interchanged.<br>
Therefore, in the case in which when the motorcycle is parked, or moved by the hand or the like, the muffler protector which is a portion of the body cover bulged to the outer side is brought into contact with an obstacle or in parking the motorcycle, the motorcycle is erroneously fallen down and the muffler protector constituting the bulged portion of the body cover is impaired or destructed, only the impaired or destructed muffler protector may be interchanged since it is a member separate from the body cover although it constitutes a portion thereof.<br>
In the interchanging operation, only a muffler protector may be detached from a body cover and a new one of the muffler protector may be screwed or the like and accordingly, the interchange operation is extremely facilitated.<br>
Further, a total of the body cover or a total of the body cover half needs not to interchange, a destructed part can be interchanged or repaired inexpensively and a burden on a user is largely reduced which is extremely advantageous in<br>
repair or interchange.<br>
Further, the muffler protector is attached integrally with the body cover. The muffler protector needs not to attach to a power unit and accordingly, a stay exclusive for the muffler protector is dispensed with, simplification of the structure of the power unit and a reduction in a number of parts can be achieved. Further, the weight reduction can also be achieved thereby.<br>
Further, the muffler protector is installed integrally with the body cover on the outer side of the vehicle body and accordingly, in running, high cooling effect of the muffler protector can be achieved by running wind.<br>
Further, the muffler and the muffler protector are<br>
separate bodies.  The muffler itself is not surrounded by the<br>
muffler protector, moved upwardly and downwardly in a naked state in running and exposed to running wind. Accordingly, further high cooling effect of the muffler itself can be achieved.<br>
