Field of invention<br>
This invention concerns apparatus and methods which allow the rapid collection of image<br>
data in situations where ancillary equipment must be controlled and co-ordinated as part of<br>
an image formation process, such as confocal microscopy for example.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
An imaging system is described in our co-pending UK Patent Application No. 0324250.0<br>
(published specification no. GB-A-2395265), the contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference. This system includes a local master clock which generates a 1KHz clock<br>
signal by which the various parts of the system are synchronised in operation. The system<br>
therefore operates at the clock speed irrespective of whether it could operate faster<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an image capture system involving a<br>
confocal microscope which is not limited to operating at a clock determined speed, but can<br>
operate as fast as possible given the limitations of the ancillary equipment, in particular the<br>
photodetector (camera).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In essence it is proposed to allow the co-ordination of at least some of the operations<br>
performed by an image capture system to be dictated by the time taken to perform them,<br>
rather by reference to a master clock signal.<br><br>
The present invention provides an apparatus for imaging light from a specimen, comprising:<br>
-	a microscope (12) having means for mounting the specimen;<br>
-	a light source (16) for illuminating the specimen;<br>
-	a scanning system (10) for scanning light from the light source over the specimen and<br>
conveying light emitted from the specimen;<br>
a photodetector (14) for exposure to light from the specimen via the microscope and<br>
scanning system to capture an image of an area of the specimen;<br>
-	memory for storing captured images; and<br>
-	control means (20') for co-ordinating the operation of the apparatus,<br>
wherein<br>
-	the photodetector (14) is operable to generate a first trigger signal (33) after each exposure<br>
and send it to the control means (20'), and to read-out the image captured during the<br>
preceding exposure to the memory,<br>
the control means is operable to transmit a second trigger signal (27') to the photodetector<br>
in response to the first trigger signal when the apparatus is ready for the next exposure, and<br>
-	the apparatus has clock means (25) for generating a clock signal, and light control means for<br>
controlling the entry of light into the photodetector or the incidence of light from the light<br>
source onto the specimen, wherein the light control means timing is determined by the clock<br>
signal, and the scanning system (10) is arranged to receive said clock signal.<br>
In known apparatus, in which all components are controlled by reference to a master clock<br>
signal, deadtimes may occur between clock ticks, whilst the system had to wait until all the<br>
 components were ready for the next operation. In an apparatus embodying the invention,<br>
these delays may be substantially eliminated, increasing the speed of operation of the<br>
The invention further provides a method of controlling such an apparatus, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	transmitting a first trigger signal (33) from the photodetector (14) after each exposure to the<br>
control means (20');<br>
(b)	reading-out the image captured during the preceding exposure from the photodetector (14)<br>
to the memory after step (a);<br><br>
(c)	preparing the apparatus for the next exposure in response to the first trigger signal (33);<br>
(d)	transmitting a second trigger signal (27') from the control means (20') to the photodetector<br>
(14) in response to the first trigger signal (33) when the apparatus is ready for the next<br>
exposure;<br>
(e)	generating a clock signal with clock means (25);<br>
(f)	determining with the clock signal the timing of light control means for controlling the entry<br>
of light into the photodetector or the incidence of light from the light source onto the<br>
specimen; and<br>
(g)	transmitting the clock signal to the scanning system (10).<br>
Furthermore apparatus according to the invention may include ancilliary components<br>
which do not rely on a clock signal for their operation, but are controlled using discrete<br>
trigger signals, giving increased flexibility in the selection of the specific peripheral<br>
devices to he used to form part of the apparatus. These aspects of the apparatus may be<br>
considered to be "self-clocking". Thus, in some embodiments, the apparatus may include<br><br>
some ancilliary components which are self-clocked whilst also including some components<br>
which are clock-driven.<br>
One system of the type at which the present invention is directed comprises a computer, a<br>
photodetector in the form of a camera, a microscope with Z-position driver, a confocal<br>
scanning mechanism, a laser system and a controller, and is described with reference to<br>
Figure 9A in our co-pending Application No. 0324250.0.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes clock means for generating a clock<br>
signal, and light control means for controlling the entry of light into the photodetector, or<br>
the incidence of light from the light source on the specimen,' wherein the light control<br>
means timing is determined by the clock signal. Whilst some components of the apparatus<br>
may be controlled using trigger signals, it has been found to be beneficial to control the<br>
light control means using a clock signal. Typically, the timing mechanism included in a<br>
camera is not sufficiently precise for applications to which the present invention is<br>
directed. A clock signal generated by the control means can give better control of the<br>
timing and duration of each exposure. The light control means may be in the fdrm of a<br>
shutter, or electronic pseudoshutter for example.<br>
In some embodiments, the same clock signal may be used to control the disk rotation rate<br>
within, the confocal scanning mechanism.<br>
More particularly, the self-clocking technique described above may be combined with<br>
clocked components (to form a hybrid system) in which a state table is operated in the<br>
manner described in our co-pending Application N.o. 0324250.0 as part of a state machine<br>
under the control of an external clock, but in which the state table is updated at each frame<br>
(or set of frames) using a self-clocking mode of operation in which a computer generates a<br>
tirning or trigger signal as provided herein so that both the original external clock and the<br>
self-clocking mechanism are maintained.<br><br>
An advantage of this hybrid arrangement is that the control of light into the camera can be<br>
determined by control of the camera shatter using an external clock, and not by the<br>
exposure timing mechanism of the camera.<br>
In one embodiment, the camera is operable to generate a trigger signal after each<br>
exposure. Furthermore, the camera may be operable to generate a trigger signal when it is<br>
ready for the next exposure. Also, the control means may be operable to transmit a trigger<br>
signal to the camera when the apparatus is ready for the next exposure.<br>
Preferably the pixels (photo elements) of the camera (or image sensor) are arranged in<br>
pairs, and one of each pair (the active site) is exposed, to light, and the other is used as a<br>
storage site. At the end of an exposure the electrical charge from the active site of each<br>
pair transfers to the storage site of the pair, where it is available for reading out into<br>
memory, typically into a buffer memory in the controller of the camera. The active sites<br>
are refreshed and are immediately available for a new exposure, during which the storage<br>
sites can be read-out and if necessary refreshed ready to receive the next charge transfer<br>
from the active sites at the end of the next exposure.<br>
The active and storage sites may be arranged so that charge is transferred on a line-by-line<br>
basis (e.g. in an interline camera) or on a frame-by-frame basis in which the data relating<br>
to the entire frame is transferred at one go (a frame transfer device).<br>
The camera thus has three modes of operation: (1) exposure, (2) transfer and (3) read-out.<br>
The start of each exposure period may be initiated by a trigger or enable pulse. At the end<br>
of each exposure, the camera generates an end of exposure trigger (or flag) signal (the A<br>
flag) to indicate that another exposure period can be started when the next trigger signal	<br>
arrives.<br>
At the same time the camera also transfers the pixel charge (image data) to the storage<br>
sites, and this transfer can occur very quickly. The camera then commences a read-out<br>
from the storage sites on the camera chip into memory. When this activity is complete,<br><br>
the camera generates an end of transfer flag signal (the B flag) to indicate that this data is<br>
available for the computer.<br>
Alternatively, generation of the end of exposure flag signal (A) may be delayed until after<br>
the transfer has occurred.<br>
The flag signals can be employed to speed up the operation of the system if the time<br>
required for movement of the camera relative to a specimen under examination to present<br>
another image to the camera, is less than the time required for data transfer and read-out to<br>
occur. In this event the only limitation is that the read-out must be completed before the<br>
end of the next following exposure period-.<br>
In a preferred apparatus for performing the invention, some or all of the controller<br>
functions can be carried out by software in the computer, so that the latter now carries out<br>
some or all of the tasks previously carried out by the controller, and if all of the functions<br>
are performed by the computer, the controller can be dispensed with.<br>
An interface to the camera from the computer or controller may be separate from the<br>
outputs to the other devices. Preferably, the confocal scarrning mechanism receives a scan<br>
clock signal from a scan clock circuit, which is "free-running" and need not be controlled<br>
by the computer, with no synchronisation between this clock circuit and any clock signal<br>
supplied to the camera. The scan clock circuit is operable to provide clock pulses which<br>
are necessary to produce the sequence of commands to the confocal scanning system for<br>
the latter to perform the steps required to present an image to the camera.<br>
Other devices such as filter wheels, a microscope controller, additional shutters, XY<br>
movement table and a stand-by power control may be connected to the system and driven<br>
in the same manner as the other external devices.<br>
Preferably, the control means is operated using software which is implemented as two or<br>
more independently executable threads. The trigger or flag signals interact with the<br><br>
software so as to determine the generation of other trigger pulses. To this end the software<br>
may use three threads which asynchronously handle the various tasks. In this context a<br>
thread is an independent path of execution within the software and in essence comprises a<br>
"thread of execution" in that it executes code to accomplish a task linked to the thread. It<br>
is of course possible for one thread to communicate and/or co-operate with another thread<br>
or threads.<br>
A further hardware device comprising a filter wheel may be added to the system such as is<br>
described in our co-pending Application No. 0324250.0.<br>
Two or more systems may be combined to control the self-clocking. For example, the<br>
control means may comprise two or more processors, with each thread assigned to one<br>
processor.<br>
The trigger or synchronisation of the threads may be performed in hardware (as described<br>
above) or in software as a 'callback' routine. A callback is a software routine in which a<br>
specified function, referred to as the callback function, is used to transfer information to<br>
the main executing program.<br>
In an alternative arrangement the signal required to trigger the camera may be obtained<br>
from one or more subsystems (such as an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) of the laser<br>
system or the microscope controller, for example).<br>
Thus Figure 8A of our co-pending Application No. 0324250.0 illustrates an example in<br>
which a hardware subsystem can provide a confirmation signal (which can be used as a<br>
trigger signal to trigger a camera). The hardware system can be considered to comprise the<br>
microscope and Z-position driver or stage drive, the confirmation signal being generated<br>
from a movement within the microscope system.<br>
Likewise Figure 10A of our co-pending Application No. 0324250.0 shows another case, in<br>
which an external trigger is used.<br><br>
Other devices connected to the system may be driven in the same manner as the other<br>
external devices, or one or more such devices may be driven by the software directly. In<br>
each case, the device will have an operating cycle, and potentially need to be synchronised<br>
with other parts of the apparatus.<br>

Figure 12 shows an example of how other devices can be connected to the system of<br>
Figure 13 is a generalisation of Figure 1 and shows how one or more of the other devices<br>

the computer.<br>
Description of the illustrated embodiments<br>
The architecture of the system is similar to that illustrated and described in our co-pending<br>
Application No. 0324250.0.<br>
Figure 1 shows a computer 20, display 21, camera 14, microscope with Z-position driver<br>
and sample stage 12, confocal scanning mechanism 10, laser system including an acousto-<br>
optic tunable filter (AOTF) 16 and controller 18 as are employed in the system of<br>
Figure 9A of our co-pending Application. A projector 17 is also included in Figure 1.<br><br>
In operation of the apparatus shown in Figure 1, controller 18, under the control of<br>
computer 20 via line 19, receives the state table to be used for the experiment. Under<br>
control from the computer, the execution of the state table is started. The controller sets a<br>
height of the microscope 12 above its sample stage for the current state via a "Z position"<br>
signal. Controller 18 then sends a "trigger/enable" signal to the camera 14. The<br>
controller sends "wavelength select" and "power level" signals to the laser system 16 to<br>
set these parameters for the current state. Camera 14 then collects light falling on the<br>
sensor. After a predetermined time, the light is switched off. Image data is transferred<br>
from camera 14 to computer 20 via the image data line. The process is repeated for the<br>
next state.<br>
The controller 18 is also responsible for generating the periodic "end of scan sync" signal.<br>
This signal sets the'speed of the scanning mechanism in unit 10, such that the light falling<br>
on the sensor is from a specific time period equal to that required for scanning the whole<br>
of the area of interest n times (where n is a whole number equal to or greater than 1).<br>
Preferably, the signal path 19 between the computer and the controller should be bi-<br>
directional in this arrangement to allow communication to co-ordinate distributed threads<br>
of software 22 running on the computer 20, as well as transfer of code and data.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention, wherein the<br>
controller functions are carried out by software 22' running on the computer 20'. The<br>
control lines remain the same but the software 22' in the computer now carries out all the<br>
tasks previously carried out by the controller 18 of Figure 1. This allows all the threads<br>
(processes) to run on the same processor, and gives full flexibility to schedule tasks<br>
required for imaging.<br>
In this arrangement of Figure 2, the interface 24 between the computer 20' and the camera<br>
14 is shown separate from the output interface 23 to the other devices (laser system,<br>
microscope, etc). The confocal scanning mechanism 10 receives a scan clock signal from a<br><br>
scan clock unit 25. This may be controlled by the computer 20' to set the appropriate speed<br>
via the line marked "set speed" in Figure 2, or it may be independent thereof. There is no<br>
synchronisation between clock unit 25 and the clocking of the camera 14 by the computer<br>
20'.<br>
Although not shown, it will be appreciated that other devices may be connected to the<br>
system and driven in the same manner as the external devices illustrated in Figure 2. These<br>
may include filter wheels, microscope control, additional shutters, XY movement table and<br>
stand-by power control, for example.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the system, the camera 14 is a so-called charge transfer CCD<br>
camera in which the image sensor pixels (photo elements) are arranged in pairs, and during<br>
an exposure only one of each pair (the active site) is exposed to light. When the exposure<br>
is complete the electrical charge from each active site is transferred to the other site of the<br>
pair (its partner storage site) and the active site refreshed ready to receive a new exposure.<br>
Tbe transferred charge stored in the storage site is available for reading out, and all the<br>
partner sites are read out (and refreshed if necessary) before the next charge transfer is to<br>
occur.<br>
Each exposure thus comprises three steps: (1) exposure to light, (2) charge transfer and<br>
refresh, and (3) read-out. These will. be. described in more detail with reference to<br>
Figure 3.<br>
The start of the exposure may be initiated by a trigger (or enable) pulse 27 (Figure 1 and<br>
Figure 2). At the end of the exposure period 29 the camera transfers the pixel charge<br>
pattern to the storage sites and refreshes the active sites. This step can be performed very<br>
quickly.<br>
Either at the end of the exposure (as shown) or at the end of the charge transfer period 31,<br>
the camera makes available a signal (the A flag) 33 to indicate that it is ready for another<br>
exposure and will accept a trigger signal.<br><br>
In relation to the true software synchronizer, the term "trigger" can either mean a software<br>
generated trigger, whereas in the hybrid case the term means running the synchronizer<br>
with the primed states using the external trigger to start and stop the AOTF, the camera<br>
and the Z-stage. In the former case, the software trigger may come as part of the package<br>
as when a Hamamatsu SDK system is employed for example.<br>
After transfer is complete, the camera commences a read-out of the stored charge pattern<br>
from the storage sites into a buffer memory in the camera controller during read-out period<br>
35. When this is complete the camera sends a signal (the B flag) 37 to indicate that this<br>
data is available for the computer to read and process.<br>
The next trigger (or enable) pulse 27', which can occur any time after transfer 31 has<br>
completed, is shown on the trigger time-line in Figure 3 and the next A flag 33' is shown<br>
at the end of the second exposure period 29' on the A flag time-line.<br>
The time during which the devices associated with the imaging system can move to present<br>
a different area of a specimen to the scanning system is denoted by box 39 and the timing<br>
of the second trigger pulse 27' is determined by the end of the movement period 39.<br>
Preferably, it occurs immediately after the end of movement period 39.<br>
Figure 4 schematically shows the software architecture. This uses three threads which<br>
asynchronously handle the various tasks.<br>
A software timing thread 41 deals with control of exposure and external devices<br>
(microscope, laser system, camera exposure time etc).<br>
The software timing thread (the first thread) deals with control of exposure and the<br>
external devices (microscope, laser system, camera exposure time etc). It uses a state<br>
table 43 (equivalent to the state memory 62 in our co-pending Application but without the<br>
state duration field, as this function is now undertaken by the self-clocking mechanism),<br><br>
which holds the settings of the various external devices. In addition the software timing<br>
thread waits until an A flag 33 is active before it takes the next entry in the state table 43,<br>
and uses this information to set the external devices. Once this is complete, the software<br>
timing thread sends a trigger signal 27 to the camera to start the exposure period 29. The<br>
software timing thread then goes back to waiting for the A flag 33 to become active again.<br>
The A flag 33 may be polled by the first thread or drive an interrupt which sends a signal<br>
to the first thread.<br>
The setting of the external devices may involve additional trigger/wait cycles.<br>
The second thread 45 is an image delivery thread. This thread waits for the B flag 37 to<br>
become active whereupon it reads the data which has been read out from the camera into a<br>
memory device in the camera controller (or computer 20' (of Figure 2)) into the computer<br>
(directly, or indirectly by supervising a transfer carried out in hardware). At this stage it<br>
signals to the third thread, image storage thread 47, that the image data is available<br>
(sending the data, or the address of the data). It then goes back to waiting for a B flag.<br>
The third thread 47 waits for a sync signal 49 from the image delivery thread 45 and on<br>
receipt thereof transfers the image data to a hard disk or to a user interface such as a<br>
graphical user interface (or GUI), as shown by arrow 51.<br>
In this way the different parts of the system wait for a previous action to be completed<br>
before moving on to the next step, and the system is termed "self-clocking" since the<br>
camera provides a signal (A and/or B) which indicates that it is ready for the next<br>
operation. The software waits for this signal before sending a trigger signal, which in<br>
turn gives rise to the change in the A/B signals. The system thus has two timing elements,<br>
namely flag A and flag B.<br>
Figure 4 also shows how on initialisation a first trigger signal 53 to prime the camera is<br>
provided by the image delivery thread or may be input by a user.<br><br>
The system may have one or more image storage threads to pass image data to disk,<br>
graphical user interface (GUI) and other subsystems; and/or the system may have more<br>
than one camera; and/or the system may have more than one image delivery thread and<br>
more than one software tuning thread to collect data from the camera or cameras.<br>
Where the controller of Figure 1 includes a computer one or more threads of software such<br>
as Figure 4 may be run as processes in the controller.<br>
Alternatively software based on the Figure 4 model may be run wholly within the<br>
computer of Figure 2 thereby obviating the need for a controller.<br>
Although Wait A and Wait B are included in both Figures 5 and 6, no "Wait C" is<br>
incorporated into the embodiment of Figure 5 but it is included in Figure 6. The Wait C<br>
will usually be required to take into account time delays in the system hardware. This<br>
ensures the trigger is only fired to start the next exposure at a time when the camera can<br>
respond.<br>
Figures 6 to 10 illustrate variations in the positioning of trigger (release) signals according<br>
to respective embodiments of the invention. In Figure 6, the "release C" flag is used to<br>
guarantee that the next exposure is not started until the previous one is complete e.g. a<br>
mixture of very short and very long exposure time.<br>
In Figure 7, the start trigger is elirminated. The threads are initialised using a dummy<br>
transfer. The callback routine is passed a blank image or an indicator for an image, which<br>
indicates that all the threads have started correctly. In addition, a 'first time' flag is set<br>
within the software timing thread, to avoid the Wait A. The advantage of this is that the<br>
system does not have to rely on an external hardware device to start up, and can instead be<br>
primed in software. If there is a hardware failure, this can be reported.<br><br>
Figure 8 is based on Figure 7 (with the dummy transfer and the first time flag). It also<br>
uses the 'release C as employed in Figure 6, albeit in a different place: between 'get<br>
exposure' and 'transfer'.<br>
Figure 9 is similar to Figure 6, but places the 'release C' in an alternative possible<br>
position, before 'wait B' .<br>
Figure 10 similar to Figure 9, with 'release C in the same position as shown in Figure 8.<br>
It will be appreciated from Figure 6 to 10 that the 'release C may be placed in various<br>
positions, so long as it is sent after the "Wait C" in the software timing thread, and<br>
irrespective of whether the start trigger is omitted in the manner shown in Figure 8, with<br>
Figure 8 showing the preferred option..<br>
Additional waits (e.g. Wait D, Wait E etc), may be required to take into account further<br>
delays which may not be sufficiently catered for by the single Wait C, and which arise<br>
from FRAP ("fluorescence recovery after photobleaching") or any other existing time<br>
delays present in the original system hardware such as is described in our earlier UK<br>
Patent Application 0324250.0.<br>
Figure 8A of our co-pending Application shows the case where the microscope<br>
(Z-positioner or stage motion) is the subsystem providing the confirmation signal - which<br>
is derived from the movement and can be used as the trigger signal in the present invention<br>
for the next exposure. Figure 10A thereof shows how an external trigger is used. To<br>
achieve self-clocking, the trigger signal may be obtained from one or more of the hardware<br>
subsystems such as the AOTF system or the microscope control.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the invention comprises a hybrid of the self-clocking<br>
principles of the present invention and the wholly externally clocked system described in<br>
our co-pending Application. Figure 11 corresponds to Figure 9B of the earlier<br>
Application, in which the State Table is operated as before as part of a state machine with<br><br>
its own clock. However, in an embodiment -of the present invention the State Table is<br>
updated, that is, moved to the next state, at each frame (exposure) or set of frames, using<br>
software such as shown in Figure 4. In this way both the original external clock, and the<br>
self-clocking mechanism are utilised, and the control of light to the camera is determined<br>
by control of the excitation light and the external clock, and not by the exposure timing<br>
mechanism of the camera.<br>
As shown in Figure 12 other devices may be connected to the system of Figure 11 and<br>
driven in the same manner.<br>
 One or more of these other devices may be driven by software such as shown in Figure 4<br>
running on a controller 18 as shown in Figure 13 or wholly in a computer, as depicted in<br>
Figure 2. In the embodiment shown in Figure 13, one of the software threads, the<br>
"software timing thread" referred to above is executed -by the controller 18, and<br>
co-operates with the software running on the computer 20.<br><br>
