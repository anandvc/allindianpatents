3 .   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. (PRSI 200002), filed concurrently and entitled "UV RESISTANT MULTILAYERED CELLULAR CONFINEMENT SYSTEM"; and to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. (PRSI 200003), filed concurrently and entitled "GEOTECHNICAL ARTICLES"; to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. (PRSI 200005), filed concurrently and entitled "WELDING PROCESS AND GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS THEREOF"; and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. (PRSI 200006), filed concurrently and entitled "PROCESS FOR PRODUCING COMPATIBILIZED POLYMER BLENDS". All four of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present disclosure relates to high performance geosynthetic articles, such as reinforcing strips, reinforcing elements, membranes and especially dimensionally stable cellular confinement systems. The present disclosure particularly relates to geosynthetic articles, characterized by structure and composition adapted to provide enhanced properties, formed of or comprising a compatibilized polymeric composition.<br>
Plastic geotechnical reinforcing elements and articles, especially cellular confinement systems (CCSs) are used to increase the load bearing capacity, stability and erosion resistance of geotechnical reinforced materials (refer hereinafter as GRM) such as soil, rock, sand, stone, peat, clay, concrete, aggregate, road building materials, and earthen materials which are supported by the CCS.<br>
CCSs are mostly manufactured from strips that include high density polyethylene (HDPE) or medium density polyethylene (MDPE), and are characterized by a honeycomb-like three dimensional cellular structure.   The structure, when filled<br><br>
with a geotechnical material including, for example, soil, rock, sand, stone, peat, and clay, concrete, aggregate, road building and other earthen materials, or mixtures of these and/or other materials, such as fluids contained in the materials, provides reinforcement and stabilization both to the geotechnical materials and surrounding structures.<br>
The CCS strengthens the GRM by increasing its shear strength and stiffness as a result of the hoop strength of the cell walls, the passive resistance of adjacent cells, and friction between the CCS and GRM. Under load, the CCS generates powerful lateral confinement forces and soil-cell wall friction. These mechanisms create a bridging structure with high flexural strength and stiffness. The bridging action improves the long-term load-deformation performance of .common granular fill materials and allows dramatic reductions of up to 50% in the thickness and weight of structural support elements. CCSs may be used in load support applications such as road base stabilization, intermodal yards, under railroad tracks to stabilize track ballast, retaining walls, to protect GRM or vegetation, and on slopes and channels.<br>
The term "HDPE" refers hereinafter to a polyethylene resin characterized by density from 0.941 to at least 0.960 g/cm3, and the term "MDPE" refers to a polyethylene resin characterized by density from 0.926 to 0.940 g/cm3.<br>
The reinforced CCS is a composite structure, wherein the GRM is compressed and densified against the CCS walls and the friction between walls and GRM keep the integrity of the structure. The plastic cells and the GRM infill dynamically support each other and should be able to survive under a wide spectrum of loads, vibrations, impact loads, thermal stresses and erosion.<br>
Three major factors affecting the long term effective durability of GRM-CCS composite structures are (1) the creep resistance of the plastic material; (2) the friction between cell wall and the geotechnical reinforced material (GRM) which is<br><br>
stabilized and reinforced within the CCS; and (3) the dimensional stability of the compacted GRM and the CCS.<br>
Creep of the CCS wall causes loosening of the friction and loss of structural functionality of the CCS-GRM composite structure. HOPE and other polyolefins fail to resist creep, especially at temperatures higher than about 35-40 degrees Celsius (°C). The situation with MDPE is even worse.<br>
The potential to heat geotechnical articles, and particularly CCS, is usually correlated with hot areas on the globe. As used herein, in one embodiment, the term "hot areas" refers to areas located within 42 degrees latitude on either side (north or south) of the Earth's equator. In one embodiment, "hot areas' reiers to areas located within 30 degrees latitude on either side of the Earth's equator. In particular, hot areas include regions along and in the desert belt. For example, North Africa, Southern Spain, Middle East, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Central America, Brazil, India, southern China, Australia and part of Japan may be considered hot areas. In general, such hot areas regularly experience temperatures above 35°C, or even above 40°C Surfaces of plastic articles exposed to direct sun light may reach temperatures of 75°C and even up to 90°C<br>
The mechanism of failure of CCS at elevated temperatures can be complex. The first step is the heating of the GRM surface and the exposed CCS surfaces - especially by absorption of sunlight. The increase of CCS temperature causes a dimensional change, since polyethylene (PE) has a high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) -about 150-200 parts per million per degree C temperature change (ppm/°C) and the CTE itself actually increases with increasing temperature. This means that 100 meters (m) of CCS will increase its length by about 60-80 centimeters (cm) when heating from 25°C to 65°C. Since the GRM held by the CCS expands much less, the coupling between GRM and CCS, i.e., the ability of the CCS to hold the GRM, is deteriorated. In addition, when the CCS is exposed to heat for a few hours per day,<br><br>
the exposure leads to creep and irreversible expansion. The result is that even when temperatures fall, the intimate contact between the CCS and the GRM is irreversibly reduced and thus the combined structural integrity and performance are reduced or even lost. Thus, the repeated cycles of heating, expansion of the CCS, resultant spreading or collapse of the GRM structure previously contained by the CCS, results in eventual failure or significant loss of function of the CCS.<br>
The situation becomes worse when the GRM is subjected to freezing and thawing of water during autumn and winter, a process that causes expansion of the GRM against the CCS. Since the creep resistance of HDPE and MDPE is medium or even low, the result is further loss of contact between CCS walls and GRM. This process is naturally occurring, for example a process in which stones are pushed up out of soil in winter, due to the cycles of freezing and thawing or, for example, freezing of water in cracked concrete or rock, leading to breaking of the concrete or rock.<br>
The shear surfaces of the CCS structure and usually the walls of each cell, may be embossed, or provided with other means of friction-enhancement, in order to increase friction with GRM and prevent deformations of the wall so that the integrity of the composite structure is not ruptured.<br>
Commercially available HDPE-based CCSs are characterized by moderate stiffness, moderate dimensional stability and acceptable creep resistance at temperatures in the range of about minus 10° to plus 40°C. These CCSs are however characterized by some drawbacks: They have moderate strength, high CTE, high tendency to creep, especially when temperatures are 40°C. and over, and chemical sensitivity to hydrocarbons and more specifically fuels and oils.<br>
Chemical sensitivity to hydrocarbons is deleterious for applications wherein the CCS or membrane is subjected to fuels and oils, for example as GRM reinforcement or for<br><br>
confinement in landfills, oilfields, gas stations, intensive parking areas and chemical industry or as a barrier in landfills and reservoirs.<br>
The limiting mechanical and chemical properties of HDPE and MDPE, and of course other polyolefins, are especially pertinent to creep resistance and limited thermal resistance as well as a high tendency to swell when exposed to hydrocarbon fluids. If one compares creep resistance and chemical resistance to hydrocarbon fluids, under the same load, between engineering thermoplastics ("ET"), such as between polyamide or polyester on one hand, and polyurethanes on the other, the engineering thermoplastic resin is by far more dimensionally stable, stiff, has a much lower tendency to creep, has much higher chemical resistance against fuels and organic fluids and higher strength.<br>
In contrast to the ETs, polyethylene has better tear and puncture resistance than engineering thermoplastic - especially at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius. Tear strength and puncture resistance are important issues in membranes and CCSs, and even more important in perforated CCS wherein perforation provides drainage through the plastic wall, but weakens the strip and increases its sensitivity to tearing. Tear and puncture resistance is also important during installation wherein the CCS is still empty before filling with GRM, and needs to survive human activity related to installation and GRM filling.<br>
The advantages of the engineering thermoplastic are even greater when properties are compared at temperatures above about 40-50°C. Since most CCS are manufactured by welding of a plurality of strips, the welding strength and rate of weld formation is better with engineering thermoplastic relative to HDPE or MDPE. Another advantage of engineering thermoplastic-based CCSs is the improved coefficient of friction with GRM and especially with soils and peat, compared with polyolefins, due to their higher polarity. Engineering thermoplastics are also more resistant against swelling by hydrocarbons such as fuels and oils.<br><br>
The major limiting factors of engineering thermoplastics as the resin of choice in manufacturing of CCS, are a high modulus of elasticity, which affects installation simplicity, relative high cost, relatively higher sensitivity to acids and bases, relative brittleness at temperature below about 10°C and a low melt strength that affects the simplicity of strip extrusion.<br>
The combination of engineering thermoplastic resins and polyolefin resins in one blend, is described in several prior art patents.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,963,799 provides compositions of polyamide and polyolefin, adapted mostly for packaging industry and methods to form alloys (compatibilized blends) thereof. The compositions described in this patent are not applicable for structural geotechnical applications including CCSs, due to its inherent brittleness, especially at low temperatures, and lack of protection against humidity and UV light. This patent does not deal with either the difficulties in welding of the compositions, or the hydrolytic instability of the polyamide phase, which may be hydrolyzed in soil, especially acidic soils. Moreover, the compositions of this patent have CTE too high for CCS and membranes.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,564,658 provides compositions of polyester and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) only, and provides no compatibilizer, i.e., no agent to stabilize the dispersion of the two immiscible polymers. Consequently, in extrusion applications, for example extrusion of strips for geotechnical applications, flow of the melt is uneven (melt fracturing), and segregation between phases is observed. The compositions described in this patent are not applicable for structural geotechnical applications including CCSs, due to their flexibility and creep tendency. Due to the nature of LLDPE the compositions of this patent have CTE too high for CCS and membranes.<br><br>
The patent also does not provide a solution for the protection of the blend from hydrolysis in soils and landfills, oils and hydrocarbons, and from the degradation induced by heat and UV light. Welding quality is not discussed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,280,066 provides compositions of polyester, polyolefin and a functionalized styrenic elastomer for improved impact resistance, especially for injection molding. The invention is limited only to polypropylene (PP) as the polyolefin fraction. PP is too rigid and lacks the flexibility at temperatures below about zero °C, a property that is mandatory in CCSs. The compositions of this patent have CTE too high for CCS and membranes.<br>
The compatibilizer according to this patent is styrene based - thus has limited UV light resistance and thus limits the composition to indoor application or outdoor application with a lifetime of about 1 to 2 years. Polyester blends, especially when not specially stabilized against hydrolysis, may fail in soils, especially those having pH greater than 7, within a relatively short period of time. This patent does not provide sufficient protection against oils and fuels, acids and bases and UV light. Welding quality is not discussed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,875,520 provides compositions of polyamide block copolymer and a very flexible polyolefin. This invention may be useful for flexible geomembranes but not for structural geotechnical applications including CCS and high performance membranes. The high flexibility that is an advantage in flexible geomembranes becomes a drawback in CCS: when a load is applied on the CCS supporting GRM, the composite structure of the two components interacts with the load as an integrated system. The CCS transfers the load from cell to cell by friction with the GRM which provides rigidity and stiffness. If the CCS is too flexible, the load induces a deformation of the CCS until friction with the GRM is lowered. At that specific state, the integrated system is irreversibly damaged and can no longer provide the required durability, stiffness and stabilization to the GRM.  The patent<br><br>
does not provide a solution to the hydrolysis of the composition in soils and landfills, or when exposed to concrete or other media characterized by pH of greater than 7. The compositions of this patent have CTE too high for CCS and membranes.<br>
UV and heat stability, especially for extended periods of 2 years or more, that are required from CCSs, are not discussed or provided as well.<br>
There thus exists a long felt need to provide an improved polymeric composition, particularly as compared to HDPE and MDPE, characterized by having improved properties, such as one or more of creep resistance at a wide .range of temperatures, such as temperatures in the range of minus 70° to plus 90°C, being stronger and stiffer, having lower CTE and lower tendency to lose its stiffness at elevated temperatures, having higher resistance to creep during freeze/thaw/heating of GRM, being more resistant to swelling by low molecular weight materials such as oils and hydrocarbons, having greater resistance to UV light and thermal degradation for periods of about 2 to about 100 years in a wide spectrum of climates ranging from arid to arctic and having improved welding strength and weld load bearing resistance. Such improved polymeric compositions would be desirable for CCS for high performance applications and for reinforcing GRM comprising oils, acids and bases, aggressive chemicals, solvents and fuels. In addition there is a need for improved geotechnical articles such as geomembranes and geogrids, having improved properties important to the applications to which such articles are put. The need for such compositions and materials made therefrom has remained unmet until now.<br>

In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the compatibilized blend provides improved weldability to articles and especially strips formed from the compatibilized blend, relative to a non-compatibilized HDPE or MDPE molded or extruded article and especially strips of the same dimensions. The improved weldability refers to faster weld formation and/or higher ultimate weld strength and/or weld ability to retain its integrity under load for prolonged periods . The improved weld strength is significantly better when compared to HDPE and MDPE<br><br>
at temperature greater than 45°C The improved weldability is provided when the article, and especially a strip, includes a compatibilized blend filled with filler according to the present disclosure.<br>
In one embodiment, the improved weldability of the compatibilized blend is particularly apparent when the welding is ultrasonic welding. Due to the effect of the compatibilized blend, strips or other articles formed of the compatibilized blend, when welded, provide very strong bonds between the welded parts. The bond strength obtained when articles formed from the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure are welded together is stronger than the bonds obtained when prior art articles that are similar but made of HDPE or MDPE.<br>
Thus the present disclosure addresses the long felt need for an improved polymeric composition, as compared to HDPE and MDPE, characterized by having improved characteristics, such as one or more of improved creep resistance at temperatures in the range of minus 70° to plus 90°C, being stronger and stiffer, having lower CTE and lower tendency to lose its stiffness at elevated temperatures, higher resistance to creep during freezing of GRM, being more resistant to swelling by oils and hydrocarbons, being more resistant to acids and bases, having greater resistance to UV light induced degradation and thermal degradation, for periods of about 2 to about 100, years in a wide spectrum of climates ranging from arid to arctic, and having improved welding strength and long term load bearing. The compatibilized polymeric compositions of the present disclosure are very desirable for CCS for high performance applications and for reinforcing GRM comprising oils, acids and bases, aggressive chemicals, solvents and fuels, and thus represent a significant improvement over the prior art.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The physical properties mentioned herein are measured at ambient temperature, i.e., about 20° to about 25°C, unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
The following description of the present disclosure is provided, together with the drawings and claims, so as to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out this invention. Various modifications, however, will remain apparent to those skilled in the art, since the general principles of the present disclosure have been defined specifically to provide compositions, a molded or extruded article, and in particular, strips, which can be formed into a CCS especially adapted for geotechnical applications. In one embodiment, the article in accordance with this invention has an improved creep resistance at temperatures in the range of minus 70° to plus 90°C and 1 percent secant flexural modulus according to ASTM D790 of at least 700 MPa. In one embodiment, the article or a layer used to form the article, has one or more of a coefficient of thermal expansion less than about 150 ppm/°C at ambient temperature; resistance to acidic media greater than polyamide 6 resin and/or resistance to basic media greater than PET resin; resistance to hydrocarbons greater than that of HDPE; creep modulus of at least 400 MPa at 25°C, at a load of 20% of yield stress and loading time of 60 minutes, according to ISO 899-1; and 1 percent secant flexural modulus of at least 700 MPa; at 25°C according to ASTM D790.<br>
The blend, the molded or extruded article, and especially the strips or CCS formed therefrom, typically includes at least one layer wherein the layer includes (a) from about 1 to about 94.5% by weight of the composition of at least one functional group containing polymer or oligomer comprising on average at least one functional group per molecule, the at least one functional group selected from carboxyl, anhydride, oxirane, amino, amido, ester, oxazoline, isocyanate or any combination thereof; (b) from about 5 to about 98.5% by weight of the composition of at least one engineering<br><br>
thermoplastic; (c) from about 0.5 to about 94% by weight of the composition of at least one filler; and (d) optionally, up to about 93.5% by weight of an unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer. In one embodiment, the filler (c) may be omitted, and so is optional in this embodiment. In an embodiment in which the filler is optional, the composition may be described as comprising (a) from about 1 to about 95% by weight of the composition of at least one functional group containing polymer or oligomer comprising on average at least one functional group per molecule, said at least one functional group selected from carboxyl, anhydride, oxirane, amino, amido, ester, oxazoline, isocyanate or any combination thereof; (b) from about 5 to about 99% by weight of the composition of at least one engineering thermoplastic; (c) optionally up to about 94% by weight of the composition of at least one filler; and (d) optionally, up to about 94% by weight of an unmodified polyolefin.<br>
In one embodiment, the compatibilized polymeric composition is characterized by creep modulus of at least 400 MPa at 25°C, at a load of 20% of yield stress and loading time of 60 minutes, according to ISO 899-1. Most polyolefins have creep modulus lower than the values disclosed herein for the geotechnical article of the present disclosure, and thus may cause premature CCS failure, usually by a plastic deformation mode, especially under combinations of high loads and temperatures of 40°C or more.<br>
In another embodiment, the novel compatibilized polymeric composition is characterized by tear strength according to ASTM D1004 of at least about 30 Newtons (N) for film thickness of 1 mm.<br>
Most engineering thermoplastic does not have sufficient tear and puncture resistance, and thus may cause to catastrophic failure of CCS formed by such material.<br><br>
Moreover, alloys of PO and ET tend to be brittle and their tear resistance is insufficient for geotechnical applications. Surprisingly, when a balanced composition of PO including a significant amount of relatively elastic polyolefin in the form of a compatibilizer as defined herein is introduced to the blend (alloy) of PO and ET, the tear strength is improved so that geotechnical applications are enabled for the composition.<br>
As used herein, the term "compatibilizer" means a functional group-containing polymer or oligomer, for example, a copolymer or terpolymer comprising an average of at least one reactive group per chain, or modified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, that contains, is grafted by and/or is functionalized by a functional group and comprising an average of at least one reactive group per chain. The compatibilizer thus includes an average of at least one functional group per one polymer or oligomer chain, i.e., a polymer or oligomer modified by an average of at least one reactive group per chain.<br>
The term "functional group-containing polymer or oligomer" refers herein either or both to a copolymer or oligomer which contains "mer" units derived from functional group containing monomers, or to a polymer, copolymer or oligomer which has been functionalized by, e.g., grafting of a functional group-containing moiety to the chain or backbone of the polymer, copolymer or oligomer. In both cases, the functional group may be one or more of carboxyl, anhydride, oxirane, amino, amido, ester, oxazoline, isocyanate or combinations thereof. The term "functionalized" or "functional group containing" refers to any product in which the reactive groups are covalently linked with the polymer or oligomer chains. As described herein, the functional group may be introduced by grafting to a previously formed polymer or oligomer, or by copolymerizing one or more functional group containing monomer with one or more non-functional group containing monomer, to form a copolymer or terpolymer in which the functional group containing monomer is included in the main chain or backbone of the polymer or oligomer.<br><br>
The term "self compatibilizer" refers herein to a modified polymer (a compatibilizer) derived from an unmodified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, in which the unmodified polymer is grafted or functionalized by a functional group containing reactant, and in which the grafting or functionalizing takes place in situ, just prior to the step of melt kneading of the self compatibilizer and, optionally, any additional unmodified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, with the engineering thermoplastic component. The functional group may be a group reactive with a component of the engineering thermoplastic component. The term "in situ" means the molten self compatibilizer is mixed with the engineering thermoplastic component direct after its manufacturing, with no cooling step between.<br>
The term "external compatibilizer" refers herein to a compatibilizer (as defined above) that is either commercially obtained or that has been formed by grafting a functional group-containing reactant to a suitable unmodified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, and in which the grafting takes place prior to the time the compatibilizer is introduced to a blend comprising the engineering thermoplastic and, optionally, unmodified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer. The external compatibilizer is provided as solid pellets or powder or flakes or any other shape to, together with the solid engineering thermoplastic and, optionally, solid unmodified polyolefin or ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, and the mixture is melted and then melt kneaded.<br>
In one embodiment, a composition in accordance with the present disclosure is made by: introducing into an extruder an unmodified polymer, an unsaturated functional group-containing reactant and a free radical initiator; first melt kneading these materials so that the reactant reacts with the polymer to graft the functional group to the polymer chain thereby forming a self compatibilizer; introducing into the extruder a molten engineering thermoplastic; melt kneading the self compatibilizer with the engineering thermoplastic downstream in the same extruder or in a<br><br>
secondary extruder; optionally adding additional unmodified polymer after the first melt kneading and either before or after introducing the engineering thermoplastic and further melt kneading if after; and extruding the composition through a die to form a strip, a profile, a three dimensional article, a film or sheet, a powder, or a plurality of beads, flakes, granules or pellets.<br>
In any embodiment in which the unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer (PO) phase is present, the PO provides the composition with hydrolytic stability (especially against acids and bases that attack the ET), tear and puncture resistance, and provides these benefits at a range of temperatures, but especially at temperatures below zero degrees C, and provides high melt strength, which is a very important parameter in extrusion and blow molding.<br>
The engineering thermoplastic (ET) phase provides the composition with stiffness, strength, dimensional stability, resistance to creep at temperatures greater than about 40°C, resistance against oils and fuels and improved barrier properties against diffusion of different materials through the molded or extruded article, improved coefficient of friction (important for welding and for friction with GRM), lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than the PO and higher barrier properties that enables slower diffusion of harmful compounds through the polymer article and slower extraction or evaporation of HALS and UV absorbers.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, the properties of the polymers described hereinafter are measured at ambient temperature, e.g., about 20° to about 25°C, and at atmospheric pressure conditions.<br>
In one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a compatibilized polymeric composition suitable for geotechnical applications, including CCS, geogrid,   geomembrane   and   soil   reinforcement,   characterized   by   high  creep<br><br>

inorganic particles, clay, kaolin, industrial ash, concrete powder, cement, dolomite, wollastonite or a mixture of any two or more thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the functional group containing polymer or oligomer is a modified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer, wherein the functional group is grafted to the polymer or oligomer. This may be formed in situ, or prior to melt kneading with ET, by functionalizing the PO in which case it is a self compatibilizer, or may be added as an ingredient, e.g./ to the extruder together with ET and any un-functionalized PO, in which case it is an external compatibilizer.<br>
In one embodiment, the functional group containing polymer or oligomer is a copolymer or terpolymer of (1) at least one unsaturated monomer and (2) at least one functional group containing unsaturated monomer, wherein the functional group containing unsaturated monomer contains at least one unsaturated group and at least one functional group.

According to yet another embodiment, the polymeric blend composition further includes a filler. The filler is selected in a non-limiting manner from a group including, inter alia, metal oxides, metal carbonates, metal sulfates, metal phosphates, metal silicates, metal borates, metal hydroxides, silica, silicates, aluminates, alumo-silicates, chalk, talc, kaolin, clay, dolomite, fibers and whiskers, metal, metal coated inorganic filler, wollastonite, kaolin, industrial ash, concrete powder and cement, or any mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the filler includes one or more of calcium carbonate, talc, clay, kaolin, industrial ash and barium sulfate.<br><br>
It is noted in this respect that introduction of a filler to the blend increases creep resistance, scratch resistance, resistance to swelling of oils and fuels, opacity, improved heat conductivity and thus resistance to UV light and thermal induced degradation, improved manufacturability, lower CTE and improved weldability. The improved heat conductivity prevents heat buildup in the compatibilized polymeric composition when exposed to sunlight and heat because the CCS surfaces are less heated by the sunlight, so that UV and thermally induced degradation is slower relative to an unfilled system.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer composition of the present disclosure includes from about 0.5 wt% to about 70 wt% of the filler. In one embodiment, the polymer composition of the present disclosure includes from about 5 wt% to about 50 wt% of the filler. In one embodiment, the polymer composition of-the present disclosure includes from about 10 wt% to about 40 wt% of the filler.<br>
In one embodiment, when the filler includes one or more of calcium carbonate, talc, dolomite, silica, clay, wollastonite, kaolin, industrial ash and barium sulfate, the CTE of an article formed of the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure is lower than about 125 ppm/°C. In one embodiment, when the filler includes one or more of calcium carbonate, talc, dolomite, silica, clay, wollastonite, kaolin, industrial ash and barium sulfate, the CTE of an article formed of the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure is lower than about 100 ppm/°C. In another embodiment, when the filler includes one or more of calcium carbonate, talc, dolomite, silica, clay, wollastonite , kaolin, industrial ash and barium sulfate, the CTE of an article formed of the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure is lower than about 90 ppm/°C. In another embodiment, when the filler includes one or more of calcium carbonate, talc, dolomite, silica, clay, wollastonite, kaolin, industrial ash and barium sulfate, the CTE of an article formed of the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure is lower than about 80 ppm/°C. As a result of the improved CTE, i.e., CTE reduced relative to materials such as HDPE, articles made according to the present disclosure<br><br>
are more dimensionally stable than articles formed of such prior art materials as HDPE.<br>
In addition to the foregoing benefits of filler, introduction of filler to the compatibilized polymeric composition results in a lower torque in the extruder and reduced power consumption, so that the production rate may increase and degradation of the components of the mixture is reduced. The effect of lowering extruder torque is most significant when the filler is surface treated so that improved compatibility with PO and/or ET is obtained.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, surface treated filler, especially sub-micron fillers and particularly nano-size fillers, are admixed and stabilize the dispersed compatibilized blend of ET and PO. Admixture of the surface treated filler with the aforesaid compatibilizer provides a synergistic compatibilization. The synergistic compatibilization is provided when dispersed phase domains (usually in the form of nodules) are spaced one from each other by mineral particles, so coalescence between adjacent domains is retarded. The combination of the filler and the compatibilizer is synergistic since the compatibilizer enables the formation of a stable dispersion during melt kneading, and the filler, and especially a nano-size filler, results in a lower tendency to coalescence during cooling and crystallization.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition further includes nano-size particles characterized by barrier properties, and permeability of said composition to molecules having a molecular weight lower than about 1000 Daltons is at least 10 percent lower as compared with a composition comprising a. same composition but without said nano-size particles. In one embodiment, the nano-size particles are selected from nano-clay, nano-silica, nano-silicates, nano-alumosilicates, nano-zinc oxide, nano-titanium oxides, nano-zirconium oxides, nano-talc, nano-tubes, nano-metal particles and/or flakes, carbon black, nano size sulfides and sulfates and nano-<br><br>
size plant or animal originated cellulose, lignin or proteins and combinations of any two or more thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition further includes an additive selected from a heat stabilizer, a hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS), an organic UV absorber, an inorganic UV absorber, a hydrolysis inhibitor or a combination of any two or more of such additives.<br>

In one embodiment, the filler is selected from a group including inter alia calcium carbonate, dolomite, talc, clay, kaolin, silica, wollastonite, barium sulfate, industrial ash, concrete powder and cement or combination of the same.-<br>
According to yet another embodiment, a dispersion of ET in PO, and vice versa, of PO in ET, by aid of compatibilizer, and a dispersion of filler within those blends are provided by a multi-screw extruder, especially an intermeshing multi-screw extruder; particularly in a co-rotating twin screw extruder.<br>
It is noted in this respect that according to the present disclosure, introduction of fillers into the composition, provides to the compatibilized polymeric composition certain advantages, especially when the compositions are extruded into a strip, membrane or three dimensional profile. Compositions including higher filler loading, lowering powder consumption by the extruder during article extrusion and reducing heat buildup due to improved heat conductivity of the blend in the melt phase. Surprisingly, when the filler is introduced into the aforesaid compositions, less mechanical energy is required for melt kneading of a mass unit of compound relative to unfilled HDPE or MDPE, and thus the relative throughput increases and heat buildup in this compound along extruder decreases. Moreover, since fluidity of the ET, and especially polyamides and polyesters, is much higher than PO, the resistance of the composition to shear during compounding and extrusion is lower than with HDPE. As a result, fewer gels are created and less degradation of the composition occurs. This invention therefore enables production of thinner strips under the same torque of the extruder and thus with increased throughput rate, as measured by unit length per unit time. This advantage becomes especially important when high molecular weight relatively elastomeric polymers are provided as the PO phase, e.g., LLDPE, EPR, EPDM, SEBS, and ethylene copolymers and terpolymers . when a composition comprising high viscosity PO polymer, usually of MFI of less than about 0.2 g/10 minutes under load of 2.16 Kg at 190°C, is melt kneaded together with a more fluid polymer, e.g., polyamide or polyester as the<br><br>
ET phase, the result is a composition that does not resist torque in the extruder, does not tend to gel and degrade in the extruder, and has good melt strength and fast crystallization rate.<br>
In one embodiment, the fillers are surface treated filler - especially those having hydrophobic surface treatment.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, dispersion of the filler and polymers is provided in a one step process, wherein the polymers (functionalized PO, ET and optionally un-functionalized PO) are fed to first hopper of an extruder, melt kneaded, and the filler is fed from a second opening in the extruder to the melt. The second opening is usually a side-opening equipped with a side feeder for at least one filler. Entrapped air and adsorbed humidity are removed by means of at least one atmospheric vent. The mixture is further melt kneaded until any agglomerates are deagglomerated and the filler is dispersed evenly in the polymer. Entrapped volatiles as well as byproducts may be optionally removed by an optional vacuum vent. The resulting composition is then extruded through a die to form pellets, powder, granules, a three dimensional article or a profile or strip formed of or including the compatibilized polymeric composition.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the filler is surface treated by an agent selected in a non-lirniting manner from organic acid, organic ester, oil, polymer, organic amide, organo-metallic including organo-silane, organo-titanate and organo-zirconate or a combination of the same. Surface treated fillers are dispersed more easily and require less mechanical energy. In one embodiment, the fillers are surface treated to have hydrophobic surfaces and in another embodiment are surface treated by a combination of an organo-metallic agent with a hydrophobic agent.<br><br>
According to yet another embodiment, pellets or granules or flakes or powder of the compatibilized blend, including filled blends, are subsequently introduced to a second extruder for re-melting and extruding into a strip or profile or sheet, or to a blow molding machine to form a blown article or film or sheet, or to an injection molding machine to form a molded part or to a compression molding machine to form a molded part.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the first extruder for melt kneading the ET, PO, compatibilizer and, optionally, the filler and/or other additives, is a multi-screw extruder, an in particular, a twin-screw extruder, and the second extruder for extruding sheet or profile or strip is a single-screw extruder or a twin screw extruder.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the dispersion is provided in a two-step process, wherein part or all of the polymers are fed to a first hopper of the extruder, melt kneaded, and the filler is fed from a second opening in the extruder to the melt. The second opening is usually a side opening equipped with a side-feeder for the at least one filler. Entrapped air and adsorbed humidity are optionally removed by means of at least one vapor vent. The mixture is further melt kneaded until most agglomerates are deagglomerated and the filler is dispersed evenly in the polymer. Entrapped volatiles, as well as byproducts, are optionally removed by an optional vacuum vent. The blend is then pumped through a die to form pellets or beads or flakes or powder that are later provided to a second extruder to be mixed with the remaining polymer. The blend is referred to hereinafter by the term 'concentrate'. The concentrate of part of the polymers and filler can also be pumped as a melt directly to a second extruder, without cooling and pelletizing.<br>
The introduction of fillers into the compatibilized polymeric composition according to the present disclosure has another advantage, especially when the compositions are extruded to a sheet, profile, film, or strip, and the strip is welded to another strip<br><br>
of the same composition, e.g., by means of an ultrasonic welding. This advantage is that the introduction of filler into the composition at a certain weight percentage improves its weldability, and this aspect will be discussed more detailed later in this disclosure. Moreover, the filler improves UV and heat stability of the blend and the geosynthetic article formed thereof. The filler may further provide coloring to the blend, e.g., in light and/or vivid colors, and especially in colors matching the confined GRM.<br>
In one embodiment, the geosynthetic article includes an extruded or molded strip having a thickness in the range from about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm. In one embodiment, the strip, having a given size, has at least 10% greater pullout force at normal stress of 4 lb/in2 (about 27.58 kPa), between the strip and sand, relative to a strip of the given size formed of virgin MDPE or HDPE, as tested by ASTM D6706-01.<br>
In one embodiment, the geosynthetic article includes friction-promoting features on at least one outer surface of said article, wherein said friction-promoting features comprise texture, embossment, debossment, through-hole, finger-like extension, hair-like extension, wave-like extension, co-extruded line, bonded fibers or grains or aggregate, dots, matte or any combination thereof.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, a strip is provided, and includes at least one layer, in one embodiment two or more layers, wherein at least one layer includes a compatibilized polymeric composition or filled compatibilized polymeric composition as defined in any of the above. The other layer or layers may be selected in a non-limiting manner from any composition as defined, inter alia, in any of the above or any other polymeric composition.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, a heterogeneous multilayered strip is provided, wherein the one or more layers, other than the at least one layer including<br><br>
the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure, includes any other polymeric compositions or blends. According to yet another embodiment, a homogeneous multilayered strip is provided wherein all layers include compatibilized blends, which may be the same as or different from each other.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, a strip including at least one layer, especially at least two layers, is provided, in which at least one layer includes nano-size particles, characterized by high barrier property against diffusion of small atoms and molecules including protons, hydroxyl ions, halides and ions thereof, free radicals, anions, cations, hydrocarbons, fuels, bases, aromatic ring containing compounds, heterocyclic ring containing compounds, low boiling point organic solvents and VOC, heavy metals, oxygen, ozone, and acids, so as the strip is more resistant against swelling, hydrolysis, oxidative degradation and extraction, evaporation or leaching of important additives, relative to HDPE based strip having the same dimensions, and is less permeable to diffusion through of the compounds. Such small molecules, in one embodiment, have molecular weight less than about 1000 Daltons. In one embodiment, the composition further includes nano-size particles which provide barrier properties to the composition. In one embodiment, permeability of the composition to molecules having a molecular weight lower than about 1000 Daltons is at least 10 percent lower as compared with a composition comprising a same composition but without the nano-size particles.<br>
The nano-size barrier particles are selected in a non-limiting manner from a group including inter alia nano-clay and modifications thereof, nano-silica and modifications thereof, nano-silicates and modifications thereof, nano-alumosilicates and modifications thereof, nano-zinc oxide and modifications thereof, nano-TiO2 and modifications thereof, nano-zirconium oxides and modifications thereof, nano-talc and modifications thereof, nano-tubes and modifications thereof, nano-metal particles and/or flakes and modifications thereof, metal coated inorganic particles and modifications thereof, carbon black, nano size sulfides and sulfates and modifications thereof and nano-size natural particles and modifications thereof,<br><br>
especially yet not exclusively plant or animal originated matrices, such as cellulose, lignin, proteins or any combination of any of the foregoing particles.<br>
In one embodiment the barrier nano size filler is selected from nano clay and modified nano clay.<br>
In one embodiment, the filler is selected from a group including metals and metal coated inorganic particles, and the layer is characterized by improved electrical conductivity. The conductivity is useful for applications wherein electrical charge, current or potential is generated or need to be transferred along the article or via the article.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, nano-size clay is introduced to at least one layer at loading of about 0.1 to about 70 percent of the compatibilized blend weight. Suitable grades of nano-size clay are supplied, e.g., by commercially available from Nanocor and Southern Clay Products.<br>
In one embodiment, when the at least one layer further includes an additive selected from a HALS, an organic UV absorber and/or an inorganic UV absorber or any combination thereof, the layer provides at least 10% lower extraction, evaporation and/or hydrolysis rate of the additive relative to a layer of HDPE comprising the same additive and having the same dimensions.<br>
In one embodiment, the at least one layer exhibits at least a 10% lower weight increase after immersion for 60 days at 25°C in n-octane relative to a layer of HDPE having the same dimensions. The lower intake of the said hydrocarbon is due to the polarity of the ET, the barrier properties provided by the filler, optionally, the nano size filler, and due to the cross-linking effect provided by the reaction between functional groups of the functionalized PO and the ET.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the at least one layer exhibits at least 10% better retention of elongation to break after immersion for 60 days at 45°C in aqueous solution having pH = 11 relative to a layer of PET having the same dimensions.<br>
In one embodiment, the at least one layer exhibits at least 10% better retention of elongation to break (ETB) after immersion for 60 days at 45°C in aqueous solution having pH - 4 relative to a layer of PA6 having the same dimensions. Retention means final ETB divided by initial ETB.<br>
The compatibilized blend defined above may further include additives selected from (i) organic UV absorbers and especially benzotriazoles and benzophenones, for example, commercially available Tinuvin™, manufactured by Ciba, and Cyasorb™, manufactured by Cytec ; (ii) inorganic UV absorbers and especially titanium oxides and zinc oxides, including micro-size, sub-micron size and nano-size particles of the additives, for example commercially available SACHTLEBEN Hombitec RM 130F TN™, by Sachtleben, ZANO™ zinc oxide by Umicore, NanoZ™ zinc oxide by Advanced Nanotechnology Limited and AdNano™ Zinc Oxide™ by Degussa; (iii) carbon black; (iv) light stabilizers and especially hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), for example commercially available Chimassorb™ manufactured by Ciba, Cyasorb™, manufactured by Cytec; or any mixture thereof.<br>
The UV and heat stabilized compatibilized blend according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, is more resistant against UV light and thermal induced degradation relative to HDPE including the same dosage of the same additives. The mechanism behind this feature is the slower leaching and/or evaporation rate, relative to HDPE, of the UV absorbers and light stabilizers from the polymeric article by humidity and heat, the slower diffusion of free radical due to increased barrier properties and the lower heat buildup in the layer due to improved heat conductivity. The leaching rate is slower due to the inherent barrier properties of engineering thermoplastic, especially polyamides and polyesters, and the improved<br><br>
barrier properties provided by the nano-size barrier fillers. The presence of filler according to the present disclosure, described above, has a positive effect on slowing down the UV light and thermal induced degradation, due to improved heat conductivity and thus elimination of heat buildup in the strip and Arrhenius-type temperature dependent acceleration of degradation. The presence of inorganic UV absorbers improves the durability due to almost zero leaching and hydrolysis of the additive.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the strip includes two or more parallel layers, wherein at least one of the layers includes stabilizers to protect from the UV light and thermal induced degradation.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, strips that include at least one layer, especially at least two layers, are provided, wherein at least one layer includes the compatibilized blend of the present disclosure. The obtained strip is useful, e.g., for geotechnical application, especially for CCSs.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, strips as defined in any of the above are characterized by an improved coefficient of friction with GRM and especially with soils and peat, relative to strips made of virgin MDPE or HDPE, as tested in methods such as ASTM D5321-02 or other standard methods of testing coefficient of friction.<br>
The sheet or strip or molded article as defined in any of the above embodiments may be provided by extrusion of the compatibilized blend directly from the same extruder used for mixing the ET and PO components, or from at least one second extruder or by molding of the blend.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the compatibilized blend is initially provided by a multi-screw extruder. The molten, pelletized or chopped compatibilized blend<br><br>
is fed to a second extruder, especially a single screw extruder, melt kneaded through a die to form a sheet or strip. The final thickness of such a strip may vary from about 0.1 millimeters (mm) to about 5 mm or more. In one embodiment the thickness of the strip is in the range from about 0.5 to about 2.5 mm.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, an improved strip, especially adapted for CCSs, is provided. The friction of the strip with confined GRM is improved by introduction of one or more friction-promoting features on at least one outer surface of the strip. Those friction-promoting features are selected in a non-limiting manner from debossed textures, embossing, holes, finger-like extensions, hair-like extensions, wave-like extensions, fibrous-like polymeric lines provided from an extruder or by spraying, co-extruded lines, dots or mat and combinations thereof. In this manner, the GRM may be interlocked with those CCS friction-promoting features. In another embodiment improved friction is provided by introduction of filler having average particle diameter of greater than about 100 microns. In a specific embodiment the filler is an industrial ash, for example ash derived from combustion of coal. In another embodiment, the compatibilized blend is foamed, so as its surface is rough and/or porous, and its friction with GRM is improved.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the strip or molded article is pigmented by pigments and/or dyes to a color of the particular GRM being reinforced by the strip and CCS formed thereof. In one embodiment, the strip has the shade of soil; alternatively, it is pigmented to a color of grass; alternatively, it is pigmented to a color of peat; alternatively, its pigmented in any predetermined color.<br>
According to still another embodiment, the ratio of the PO and ET components can be adjusted according to the expected use of the CCS. Thus, for example, when the CCS is to be used in desert-like conditions or in tropical regions, where the ambient temperature and sunlight and UV exposure in use is expected to be much higher than in temperate regions, the relative amount of ET can be increased relative to the<br><br>
PO. In one embodiment, the ratio for use in the hot areas is from 4 parts ET to 1 part PO to 1 part ET to 4 parts PO. Since increase in ET/PO ratio can provide enhanced strength at such temperatures, since the PO could become more easily stretched and weakened at higher temperatures. On the other hand, where the CCS is expected to be used in regions where the ambient temperature of use is expected to be lower than in temperate regions, e.g., sub-arctic, arctic, sub-antarctic or antarctic regions, then the relative amount of PO may be increased to provide better flexibility at such relatively low temperatures. In one embodiment, the ratio for use in the cold areas is from 1 part ET to 1 part PO to 1 part ET to 10 parts PO. Moreover - in those area wherein low temperature are expected during autumn and winter, PO phase further including a relatively elastomeric polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) lower than zero C. Thus, in one embodiment, the process of forming the compatibilized polymeric composition further includes selecting relative quantities of the at least one polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer and the at least one engineering thermoplastic to provide creep resistance and flexural modulus appropriate to a latitude and/or environmental conditions expected in a region in which the geotechnical articles will be used. Similarly, in another embodiment, the relative quantities of additives may be adjusted according to the expected use. For example, where solar UV is high, additional UV absorbers and/or HALS may be included , In one embodiment, the PO phase includes ethylene acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or ester copolymers or terpolymers, characterized by higher resistance to UV light relative to HDPE and ET. Examples of such UV resistant polymers are the commercially available polymers ELVALOY™ manufactured by Du-Pont and LOTRYL™ manufactured by Arkema.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the strips are assembled into three dimensional CCS, which includes a plurality of strips, as defined in any of the above, in which one strip communicates with its neighboring strip in a side by side relationship via discrete physical joints, so that those joints are spaced one from another by non-joined areas. See, e.g., Fig. 1, described in more detail below. In one embodiment, the joints are a result of welding, bonding, sewing or any combination<br><br>
thereof. According to yet another embodiment distance between joints is varied from the range of about 50 mm to about 1500 mm, measured from the ends of adjacent joints. The term 'about' refers in the present disclosure to a range of +20% of the defined measure.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the distance between joints is in the range of about 51 mm to 1500 mm or more, measured from the center of each joint. In one embodiment the joints are welded by an ultrasonic apparatus, especially by pressureless methods and means of joining the same. The weldability, especially by ultrasonic welding, according to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, is a significantly improved factor in the process of CCS manufacturing. In one embodiment, a plurality of extruded strips, cut to a pre-defined width, are welded to form a very durable CCS for GRM confinement.<br>
In one embodiment, the article comprises an extruded or molded strip having a thickness in the range from about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm. In one embodiment, the strip, having a given size, has at least 10% greater pullout force at normal stress of 4 lb/in2 (about 27.58 kPa), between the strip and sand, relative to a strip of the given size formed of virgin MDPE or HDPE, as tested by ASTM D6706-01. In another embodiment, the geotechnical article includes friction-promoting features on at least one outer surface of the article, wherein the friction-promoting features include, for example, texture, embossment, debossment, through-hole,. finger-like extension, hair-like extension, wave-like extension, co-extruded line, bonded fibers or grains or aggregate, dots, matte or any combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the geotechnical article is a three dimensional cellular confinement system (CCS) including a plurality of the strips, each of the strips communicating with its neighboring in a side by side relationship via discrete physical joints, in which the joints are spaced one from the other by non-joined areas. In one embodiment, the three dimensional CCS is adapted for containment and/or<br><br>
confinement and/or reinforcement of earthen material, soil, rock, gravel, sand, stone, peat, clay, concrete, aggregate, road building materials and any combination of two or more thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the joints are provided by welding, bonding, sewing, stapling, riveting or any by combination thereof. In one embodiment, the joints are welded by one or more of ultrasonic welding, laser welding and hot-press welding. In one embodiment, the composition of the present disclosure results in at least 10% shorter cycle time of welding relative to virgin HDPE for a same weld dimension. That is, when an article made of the composition described herein is welded, the time required to form an acceptable weld is reduced by at least 10%, in this embodiment.<br>
In one embodiment, a geotechnical article formed of or including the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure provides weldability in which weld lines and weld spots (e.g., isolated welds not necessarily in a line) are able to withstand years of continuously applied loads at temperatures in excess of 40°C, in one embodiment, temperatures from about 40°C up to about 70°C, and in another embodiment, temperatures from about 40°C up to about 60°C In one embodiment, a geotechnical article formed of or including the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure is able to withstand such temperatures for periods ranging from at least 2 years up to about 100 years. In one such embodiment, such geotechnical article is able to withstand such temperatures for such periods without disintegration or significant creep. By contrast to the present disclosure, geotechnical articles made of prior art materials such as HDPE or MDPE, are not able to withstand such temperatures for such periods of time, if at all. In one or more such embodiments, such geotechnical articles provide such performance far surpassing the performance of prior art materials such as HDPE or MDPE.<br>
Polyethylene is known to be difficult to weld by ultrasonic welding, due to its low density, low modulus and low coefficient of friction.  The novel combination of ET<br><br>
and PO provides improved weldability in comparison with HDPE. The improved weldability as disclosed in the present disclosure is a result of a combination of properties as defined above. The improved weldability is most significant in ultrasonic welding. Hence, during ultrasonic welding, high-frequency, e.g., ultrasonic mechanical vibrations are transmitted by an ultrasonic welding machine to the mating plastic parts. At the contact point, joint or interface of the two parts, a combination of applied force and surface and/or intermolecular friction from the ultrasonic vibrations increases the temperature until the melting point of the thermoplastic is reached. The ultrasonic energy is then removed and a molecular bond or weld results between the two plastic parts. High coefficient of friction and high acoustic conductivity is favored.<br>
Ultrasonic welding is more efficient in relatively rigid materials and relatively amorphous ones.<br>
An ultrasonic welding system typically contains a high-frequency power supply, usually 20-40 kHz. The high-frequency energy is directed into a horn, also known as a sonotrode, that transmits the mechanical vibrations into the target to be welded.<br>
Surprisingly, when ET and PO are blended, including a compatibilizer, according to the method defined in the present disclosure, and especially when the compatibilized blend further includes filler, the weldability is significantly improved relative to unfilled HDPE-based strip and unfilled PO-ET blends, having similar dimensions. The improvement is in the speed wherein the surface is melted, the speed wherein the surface is recovering its strength, the final weld strength and its load bearing capabilities for prolonged periods at elevated temperatures..<br>
A suggested mechanism is illustrated as follows in a non-limiting manner as a synergistic weldability: the more rigid ET-rich phase, characterized by high modulus<br><br>
of elasticity and low acoustic damping, i.e., creep modulus, loss modulus, and dissipation factor, responds fast to the ultrasonic vibrations and heats up the lower melting point PO-rich phase, so that the weld is formed faster than when HDPE alone is welded. The presence of filler in those polymeric phases, and especially in the ET-rich phase, increases its modulus of elasticity, coefficient of friction and the velocity of sound in the phase. During a subsequent cooling step, the ET-rich phase crystallizes faster than the PO-rich phase, so that a shorter cycle time is provided. During the cooling step, the filler serves as nucleating agent. The presence of filler, especially sub-micron particles and nano-size particles, improves the nucleation rate of both ET and PO phase, so that the resulting weld becomes strong and durable much faster relative to un-filled HDPE or MDPE or to an un-compatibilized PO-ET blend.<br>
In one embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength, measured 48 hours after welding, at ambient temperature of two strips welded together according to the present application is greater than about 1300 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br>
In another embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength measured 48 hours after welding, at minus 20°C of two strips welded together according to the present application is greater than about 1600 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br>
In one embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength measured 48 hours after welding, at ambient temperature of two strips welded together according to the present application is greater than about 2000 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br><br>
In another embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength measured 48 hours after welding, at minus 20°C of two strips welded together according to the present application is greater than about 2400 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br>
In one embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength of two welded strips at minus 20°C is greater than about 1000 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br>
In one embodiment, when two strips are joined by welding, the ultimate weld strength of two welded strips at plus 70°C is greater than about 1000 N for a weld width of 100 mm.<br>
As shown, for example, by the foregoing, in one embodiment, the improved weldability provided by the compatibilized polymer composition of the present disclosure is an important and integral part of the product integrity of articles formed in accordance with the present disclosure. In articles such as the CCS, the point at which parts are welded together is a weakness point and the formation of such welds, particularly formation of high quality welds, is a time consuming process. The novel compatibilized polymeric composition provides better heat conductivity, and sound conductivity, so that welding, especially ultrasonic welding, is faster and the resulting weld is more consistent, stronger and performs better and lasts longer under the type of continuous loading to which geotechnical articles, and especially CCS, are subjected. All of these improvements result from the compatibilized polymeric composition in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
In one embodiment, a portion of the geotechnical article includes a reinforcing structure adapted for use in attaching the article to a substrate, for use as CCS. That is, for example, the CCS must be anchored to the ground or other substrate upon which it is being used. See Figs. 1, 3 and 6, discussed below.  In general, a stake or<br><br>
wedge, in the form, for example, of a short length of rebar, a spike, an angle-iron, or a polymeric material (including, in one embodiment, the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure), is used to anchor the CCS to the ground. The physical form of such stake or wedge is known in the art. Thus, in one embodiment oi me present disclosure, a geotchnical article, such as a CCS, is formed with the compatibilized polymer composition and is employed in combination with wedges and tendons. In one embodiment, the tendons, and in another embodiment, the wedges, and in yet another embodiment, both the wedges and the tendons, are also formed from a compatibilized polymer blend according to the present disclosure. Thus, although wedges and tendons are known in the prior art, the present disclosure includes the combination of a geotechnical article, either formed of or including a compatibmzec* polymer composition as described herein, in combination with wedges and tendons. in another embodiment, the geotechnical article and either or both of the wedges and tendons are either formed of or include the compatibilized polymer composition of the present disclosure.<br>
The point at which the stake contacts the CCS, in one embodiment, is reinforced. In one embodiment, the reinforcing structure includes a compatibilized polymeric composition having a ratio of the at least one polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer with respect to the at least one engineering thermoplastic which is adjusted to provide at least one of enhanced strength, enhanced resistance to degradation resulting from contact with materials used for attaching to a substrate, enhanced resistance to UV, enhanced resistance to elevated temperatures, or enhanced resistance to thermal expansion. Thus, in one embodiment, an additional layer of the geotechnical article is provided at the general location at which a stake will be used to anchor the geotechnical article to the ground. See Fig. 6, discussed below. In one embodiment, the additional layer includes a different ratio of PO and ET, relative to that used for the remainder of the CCS, to provide enhanced strength and/or improved resistance to environmental effects. For example, increasing the relative amount of the ET will provide improved strength. As another example, stakes are often made of iron (e-g., the rebar mentioned above), and iron will absorb<br><br>
more heat in sunlight and/or high temperature conditions than will the geotechnical article. This heat will be transferred to the article and may weaken it at and near the contact point. Thus, the reinforcement can provide improved resistance to elevated temperatures reached by the stake, with which it is in contact. As will be understood, the degree of adjustment of the ratio of PO to ET is somewhat limited, because the desirable features resulting from the combination of components of the compatibilized polymeric composition remain important in the reinforced portions of the article.<br>
Descriptions of Embodiments Illustrated in the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a single layer CCS including a plurality of welded strips, wedges and tendons, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In Fig. 1, there is shown a CCS 10 reinforced by tendons 12. The CCS 10 includes a plurality of strips of plastic 14 which are bonded, sewn or welded together, and particularly, ultrasonically welded, one strip to the next at alternating and equally spaced bonding areas 16 to form cell walls 18 of individual cells 20. Pairs of the strips 14 are paired, starting, for example, with an outside strip 22 paired to an inside strip 24, a pair of the next two inside strips 24, and so on. Each such pair is bonded, e.g., at a bonding area 16, As shown at the left end of Fig. 1, which shows an end of the CCS, the bonding area 16 includes a weld 26 adjacent the end 28 of each strip 14. At the ends of CCS, a short tail 30 between the end 28 of strip 14 and the outside weld 26 is provided to stabilize segments of the strip 14 adjacent the outside weld 26. Each pair of strips is welded together at additional bonding areas 16, creating approximately equal length strip segments between the outside welds 26. In addition to these welds, each strip 14 (except the outermost strip) from each adjacent pair of strips 24 is also welded at an intermediate point 32 to adjacent strips at positions intermediate each of the welds in the pairs of strips. As a result, when the plurality of strips 14 are stretched in a direction perpendicular to the faces of the strips, the plastic strips bend in a sinusoidal manner and form a web of cells 20, referred to herein as a CCS, in a repeating cell pattern. Each cell 20 of the cell web has cell walls made from one strip and a cell wall made from a different strip.<br><br>
AS noted herein, the compatibilized polymeric composition in accordance with the present disclosure provides, in one embodiment, enhanced weldability, which includes enhanced and/or improved weld strength of welds formed from the composition of the present disclosure, compared to welds formed of prior art materials, This enhanced and/or improved weld strength is important not only during the sometimes long years of use of articles made from the composition, but also during installation of the articles, such as geotechnical articles and CCS. Thus, the welds are subjected to high stress during one or more points, e.g., (1) compression of the article by the GRM it holds during installation; (2) expansion of the GRM during high humidity periods; (3) expansion of the GRM during freezing/thawing cycles of water contained in the GRM; and (4) thermal mismatch (arising, for example, from different CTE) between the GRM and structures of the article such as CCS walls.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1, adjacent the bonding areas 16 or 32, are apertures 34 in some of the strips 14. Each tendon 12 extends through a series of apertures 34 which are substantially coincident. The tendons 12 reinforce the cell web and improve the stability of web installations by acting as continuous, integral anchoring members which prevent unwanted displacement of the web. It is noted that, while the CCS shown in Fig. 1 includes tendons, tendons are not always needed or used in CCS. For example, where wedges (described below) are used, tendons may not be needed, and where the CCS is not subject to shifting, tendons may not be needed. Tendons may be used in channel and slope applications to provide additional stability against gravitational and hydrodynamic forces and may be required when an underlayer or naturally hard soil/rock prevents the use of stakes.<br>
In Fig. 1, the CCS embodiment shown further includes wedges 36, which are used to attach the CCS to the substrate to which it is applied, e.g., to the ground. The wedge 36 is inserted into the substrate to a depth sufficient to provide an anchor to assist in holding the CCS in place. The wedges 36 may take the form of any wedge known in<br><br>
the art for use with CCS. In one embodiment, the wedge 36 is simply a section of iron or steel rebar, cut to an appropriate length. In another embodiment, the wedge 36 is formed of a polymeric material. In another embodiment, the wedge 36 is formed of any of the compatibilized polymeric compositions as disclosed in the present disclosure for use in the CCS itself. In one embodiment, the composition of the wedge 36 may be the same compatibilized polymeric composition as in the CCS with which the wedge is used, and in another embodiment, the composition of the wedge differs from that of the CCS with which it is used. In one embodiment, the wedge is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by a higher loading of the ET component. In one embodiment, the wedge is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by employing a different polymer or blend of polymers for the ET component of the composition.<br>
Additional apertures 34 may also be included in the polymeric strips, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,296,924. These additional apertures increase frictional interlock with the GRM by up to 30%, increase root lock-up with vegetated systems as roots grow between the cells 20, improve lateral drainage through the strips to give better performance in saturated soils, and promote a healthy soil environment. Reduced installation and long-term maintenance costs may also occur. In addition, such CCSs are lighter and easier to handle compared to CCSs with solid walls. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a single cell 20 of a CCS formed of or including the compatibilized polymeric composition, containing a GRM, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The CCS cell 20 shown in Fig. 2 is depicted as it might appear when the CCS is located on a slope (direction indicated by the arrow A), so that the GRM retained within the cell is disposed substantially horizontally, while the walls of the CCS are disposed perpendicularly to the slope on which the CCS is located. As a result, the CCS and the cell 20 thereof are tilted towards the viewer. Thus, the walls 14 of the CCS are not aligned vertically, but are approximately perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, and so the GRM fills the tilted CCS leaving an "empty area" on the up-slope side of the CCS, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.<br><br>
The cell 20 depicted in Fig. 2 is subject to the forces F1 and F2 at the side walls 14 and to the force F3 at the weld. As a result of the above-described tilting and the empty area, the forces Fl and F2 applied to the walls of the CCS are not balanced. On the near side of the cell 20, the GRM fills the cell up to the upper edge, applying force Fl against the wall from the inside. The GRM in the cell 20, and the GRM in adjacent, downslope cells (not shown in Fig. 1) exerts a force F2 in an upslope direction. Due to the empty area the force F2 is less than the force Fl. This unbalanced force may lead to failure - especially of prior art welds when the temperature of the CCS wall exceeds about 40°C, or when fuels and organic fluids are in contact with the CCS. Thus, there is a strong need for a polymeric composition, such as the compatibilized polymeric composition disclosed herein, that provides greater strength, better heat and chemical stability and improved weld reliability.<br>
The force F3 shown in Fig. 2 results from the GRM, and tends to apply a separation force to the weld 16. The force from the GRM results both from its mass and, or example, from expansion of the GRM during repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and/or repeated heating-cooling cycles. Damage from these two physical forces may be further accelerated when hydrocarbons such as fuels and organic fluids come into contact with the CCS. During freezing of water contained in the GRM, the GRM expands, applying pressure against the walls 14 and the weld 16, then the GRM relaxes upon cooling to "fill" or relax into any expanded area resulting from the pressure, and then the GRM again expands during the next freeze cycle, and so forth. This demonstrates both the result of freeze-thaw cycling on the CCS and the pressures applied to the weld 16, and shows the importance of a strong weld between the adjacent strips forming the CCS.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a single cell 20 of a CCS formed of or including a compatibilized polymeric composition, containing a GRM as in Fig. 2, and also including a wedge 36, as described with respect to Fig. 1, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure.   Fig. 3 illustrates forces applied to the CCS<br><br>
and to the individual cell 20 containing the wedge 36. As suggested by Fig. 1, not every cell in a CCS includes a wedge 36. A sufficient number of wedges 36 are used to help retain the CCS in its original location on the substrate to which it is applied.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the forces F1 and F2 (described above with respect to Fig. 2) remain present in Fig. 3, and apply substantially the same pressures to the cell 20 as described above. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, a wedge 36 has been added, and it applies a force designated F4 to add to the forces F2 in balancing the forces Fl and to maintain the CCS in position. As will be recognized, the presence of the wedge 36 applies the force F4 in a very localized part of the upper wall 14. The increased, localized pressure can have a detrimental effect on the wall, if it is not sufficiently strong and creep-resistant. If the CCS wall is chemically sensitive to oils and fuels - as is the case with HDPE or MDPE, for example, the wall becomes weak, more flexible and more likely to yield at such localized, specific stress concentration points.. In one embodiment, described below with respect to Fig. 6, the upper wall is reinforced by addition of an auxiliary wall portion, in order to mitigate the possibly detrimental effects of the localized pressure from the wedge 36 on the upper wall 14.<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a single cell 20 of a CCS, formed of or including a compatibilized polymeric composition, including a tendon 12, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. As described with respect to Fig. 1, the tendon 12 passes through the walls 14 at the apertures 34. The tendon 34 is used to help maintain the CCS in its intended location, particularly in those applications wherein wedges are forbidden or cannot be used due to limitations imposed by the substrate. For example, tendons may be used in an application where the CCS is placed on a geomembrane, and it is desired to not penetrate the geomembrane with a wedge. As shown in Fig. 4, the tendon 34 applies stress to the wall 14 in the vicinity of the aperture 34. This stress can result in damage to the wall 14, possibly leading to failure of the CCS. In one embodiment, the tendon 12 is simply a section of rebar, cut to an appropriate length.   In another embodiment, the tendon 12 is<br><br>
formed of a polymeric material. In another embodiment, the tendon 12 is formed of any of the compositions as disclosed in the present disclosure for use in the CCS itself. In one embodiment, the composition of the tendon 12 may be the same composition as in the CCS with which the tendon is used, and in another embodiment, the composition of the tendon differs from that of the CCS with which it is used. In one embodiment, the tendon 12 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by a higher loading of the ET component. In one embodiment, the tendon 12 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by employing a different polymer or blend of polymers for the ET component of the composition<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a single cell 20 of a CCS, formed of or comprising a compatibilized polymeric composition, including a tendon 14 and lockers 38, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The lockers 38 are provided to spread out the force of the stress applied to the walls 14 by the tendon 16. The spreading results in application of a reduced pressure per area of the wall 14. The locker 38 may be formed of any appropriate material. The locker 38, in one embodiment, is formed of a composition as described herein, in accordance with the polymeric composition of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the locker 38 includes a polymeric composition that is the same as that of the CCS with which it is used, and in another embodiment, the locker 38 includes a polymeric composition that is different from that of the CCS with which it is used. In one embodiment, when the polymeric composition of the locker is different, it contains a higher content of the ET component, and in another embodiment, it contains an ET component providing higher strength than that of the CCS with which it is used. The locker provides a means to transfer stress between the tendon and the wall of the CCS through which the tendon passes. By using the locker 38, the forces transferred from the tendons to the wall of the CCS can be spread out. While the wall of the CCS, being formed of or including the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure, is quite strong as described in detail herein, use of the locker 38 provides added protection against failure in the long term.<br><br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a single cell 20 of a CCS, formed of or including a compatibilized polymeric composition, including a wedge 36 and a reinforced wall portion 40, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. The reinforced wall portion 40, like the locker 38 does for the tendons 12, spreads out and disperses the pressure resulting from the force applied by the wedge 38 to the wall 14. The embodiment shown in Fig. 6 includes a reinforced wall portion 40 having a size significantly wider than the wedge 36. In other embodiments, the reinforcing wall portion 40 may be a different size, either smaller or larger than that illustrated, as determined by the person of ordinary skill employing the CCS. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 extends the full width of the strip from which the wall 14 to which it is attached is formed, and in another embodiment, the reinforcing wall portion 40 may extend less than or greater than the full width of the wall 14. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 extends beyond the upper edge of the wall 14 and is folded down over the far side of the wall 14, further to increase the strength of the overall wedge-contacting portion of the wall of the CCS.<br>
In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 is attached to the wall 14 with an appropriate adhesive, e.g., a pressure-sensitive adhesive or a curable adhesive. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 may be attached to the wall 14 by a welding operation, particularly ultrasonic welding, or sewing, performed onsite. In another embodiment, the reinforced wall portion can be applied to the wall 14 at the same time when the welds 16 and 26 are formed.<br>
The reinforced wall portion 40 may be formed of any suitable polymeric material. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 is formed of any of the compositions as disclosed in the present disclosure for use in the CCS itself. In one embodiment, the composition of the reinforced wall portion 40 may be the same composition as in the CCS with which the reinforced wall portion 40 is used, and in another embodiment, the composition of the reinforced wall portion 40 differs from that of<br><br>
the CCS with which it is used. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by a higher loading of the ET component. In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by employing a different polymer or blend of polymers for the ET component of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the reinforced wall portion 40 may be used instead of the locker 38. That is, reinforced wall portion 40 may include an aperture 34, through which a tendon 12 may pass. In another embodiment, a combination of a locker 38 and a reinforced wall portion 40 may be employed with a tendon 12. Such may be used, for example, where an especially high stress is expected to be applied to the wall of the CCS during use.<br>
In one embodiment, the layer or strip, or article formed thereof, further includes at least one additional layer applied to or coextruded or co-molded with the first layer. In one such embodiment, the additional layer may include (1) a composition including the (a), (b) and (c) components in a combination which may be the same as or different from the composition of the first layer, or (2) a material different from the composition comprising said (a), (b) and (c). Thus, the additional layer may include the same composition, or a different composition within the scope of the present disclosure, or the additional layer may include some other material, such as another polymer or other structure suitable for the needed reinforcement.<br>
Fig. 7 schematically illustrates an embodiment of the present disclosure, in which a strip 14, made in accordance with an embodiment of the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure, further includes an outer layer 42. The outer layer 42 may be applied by lamination or co-extrusion, or may be adhered to the strip 14 by an adhesive. The outer layer 42 may be composed of any appropriate material.  In one embodiment, the outer layer 42 includes a polymeric material.  In<br><br>
one embodiment, outer layer 42 includes a compatibilized polymeric composition in accordance with the present disclosure. In one embodiment, outer layer 42 includes a compatibilized polymeric composition in accordance with the present disclosure, but having a different combination of the PO, ET and compatibilizer In one embodiment, the outer layer 42 includes a polymeric material forming a barrier layer. The barrier layer may provide, for example, improved chemical resistance (for example ultra-thin coating or deposit, such as parylene, plasma polymer, or inorganic layer), improved UV resistance, improved thermal resistance and/or improved friction with the GRM. Thus, in one embodiment, the outer layer 42 is formed of any of the compositions as disclosed in the present disclosure for use in the CCS itself. In one embodiment, the composition of the outer layer 42 may be the same composition as in the CCS with which the tendon is used, and in another embodiment, the composition of the outer layer 42 differs from that of the CCS with which it is used. In one embodiment, the outer layer 42 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by a higher loading of the ET component. In one embodiment, the outer layer 42 is formed of a composition having greater rigidity, obtained, for example, by employing* a different polymer or blend of polymers for the ET component of the composition.<br>
Fig. 8 schematically illustrates an embodiment of the present disclosure, in which a strip 14, made in accordance with an embodiment of the compatibilized polymeric composition of the present disclosure, further includes a first outer layer 42 and a second outer layer 44, disposed on the strip 14 on the side opposite that on which the first outer layer 42 is disposed. The outer layers 42 and 44 may be applied as described above with respect to the embodiment shown in Fig. 7, and may include any of the materials described above with respect to the embodiment shown in Fig. 7. In one embodiment, the second outer layer 44 is formed of the same material as the first outer layer 42, and in another embodiment, the second outer layer 44 is formed of a different material than that of the first outer layer 42.<br><br>
The materials for use with each of the CCS, the tendons, the wedges and the reinforced wall portions may be appropriately selected by those of skill in the art based upon the foregoing description. In one embodiment, the materials may be appropriately selected as taught herein based on the geographical location at which the CCS is to be used, and more particularly, based on the known and expected maximum temperatures to which the CCS is to be exposed, and on the amount of sunlight to which the CCS is to be exposed. As noted above, this may be determined, in one aspect, based on the latitude at which the CCS is to be used.<br>
In one embodiment, the geosynthetic article is a geomembrane. In one embodiment, the geomembrane includes a plurality of sheets welded or bonded together at respective edges thereof. In one embodiment, the geomembrane includes one or more sheet having one or more of (a) lower permeability to one or more of acids, bases, oils, fuels, heavy metals, dioxins, oxygen, nitrates, SOx, NOx, chlorofluorocarbons, organophosphorus compounds, herbicides, pesticides, halogens, halogen acids, ammonia, bacteria, viruses and organic solvents relative to a HDPE geomembrane having same dimensions; (b) at least 10% better retention of elastic modulus when exposed to fuels and hydrocarbons relative to a HDPE geomembrane having same dimensions; and (c) at least 10% higher creep modulus at a load of 20% of yield stress and loading time of 60 minutes, according to ISO 899-1 measured at 60 Celsius, relative to a HDPE geomembrane having same dimensions.<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 schematically illustrate four processes for making a polymeric composition in accordance with the present disclosure. Referring first to Fig. 9, there are shown two embodiments in which an external compatibilizer is employed.<br>
In Fig. 9, in Process A, an external compatibilizer is combined with an engineering thermoplastic, and the mixture is melt kneaded in an extruder to form the product, which is a polymeric composition as described herein. The process optionally includes   melt   kneading   together   with   the   external   compatibilizer   and   the<br><br>
engineering thermoplastic one or more optional ingredients. In the embodiment illustrated in Process A, the at least one functional group containing polymer or oligomer comprises an external compatibilizer.<br>
In Fig. 9, in Process B, in a first step, an unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer is combined with a functional group-containing unsaturated reaction and a free radical initiator in an extruder and these ingredients are melt kneaded and the functional group-containing unsaturated moiety is grafted onto the unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer, to thereby form an external compatibilizer, which is collected as a solid, e.g., as pellets. In the second step, the external compatibilizer thus formed is combined with an engineering thermoplastic, and the mixture is melt kneaded in an extruder to form the product, which is a polymeric composition as described herein. The process optionally includes melt kneading together with the external compatibilizer and the engineering thermoplastic one or more optional ingredients. In the embodiment illustrated in Process B, the at least one functional group containing polymer or oligomer comprises an external compatibilizer.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 10, there are shown two embodiments in which a self compatibilizer is formed and immediately employed in forming a composition in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
In Fig. 10, in Process C in a first step, an unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer is combined with a functional group-containing unsaturated reaction and a free radical initiator in a first extruder and these ingredients are melt kneaded such that the functional group-containing unsaturated moiety is grafted onto the unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer, to thereby form a self compatibilizer in the first extruder. The self-compatibilizer is then combined with a molten engineering thermoplastic in a second extruder, in which, in one embodiment, these ingredients are melt kneaded to form the product.    In this<br><br>
embodiment, the process optionally includes melt kneading together with the self compatibilizer and the engineering thermoplastic one or more optional ingredients. If this is done by adding the optional ingredients at the same time that the engineering thermoplastic is added, all of these ingredients can be melt kneaded in the second extruder to form the product, as shown by the arrow (1) in Process C. In an alternate embodiment of Process C, the optional ingredients may be added to the process after the engineering thermoplastic has been melt kneaded with the self compatibilizer, in which case the optional ingredients can be melt kneaded with the product of the second extruder in a third extruder, as shown by the arrow (2) in Process C, to form the product.<br>
In Fig. 10, in Process D, the entire process is carried out in a single extruder. In this embodiment, in a first portion of the extruder, an unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer is combined with a functional group-containing unsaturated reaction and a free radical initiator and these ingredients are melt kneaded such that the functional group-containing unsaturated moiety is grafted onto the unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or terpolymer, to thereby form a self compatibilizer in the first portion of the extruder. Then, in a second, downstream portion of the same extruder, a molten engineering thermoplastic is fed into the extruder through an appropriate port, and is combined with the newly formed self compatibilizer in a second extruder. In the second portion of the extruder, these ingredients are melt kneaded to form the product. In the embodiment illustrated in Process D in Fig. 10, the process optionally includes melt kneading together with the self compatibilizer and the engineering thermoplastic one or more optional ingredients. These optional ingredients may be added before, at the same time as, or following addition of the engineering thermoplastic. These ingredients are melt kneaded in the same extruder to form the product, as shown in Fig. 10, Process D.<br><br>
It is noted that, among the optional ingredients in the embodiments shown in both Process C and Process D in Fig. 10, is an external compatibilizer which may be used in addition to the self compatibilizer formed in these embodiments of processes in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Weld Test Example<br>
For one embodiment of the present disclosure, the resistance to long term loading exhibited by welded strips formed of a compatibilized polymeric composition according to the present disclosure is shown in TABLE 1. A pair of strips of 100 mm width each are welded across the full width of 100 mm by ultrasonic sonotrode at 20 MHz, and the loads indicated in TABLE 1 are applied to ten such welded pairs at ambient temperature. The fraction of welded pairs left intact is measured versus the time period in days during which the indicated loads are applied. As shown in TABLE 1, the materials of the present disclosure provide high and improved weld strengths and durability, relative to prior art materials, such as HDPE or MDPE.<br>
TABLE 1 - Weld Test Results<br><br>

Next, five polymeric strips STl - ST5 and one reference strip are made (STl includes INV1, ST2 includes 1NV2... etc.). All strips are manufactured in a sheet extrusion line including a main single screw extruder for the core layer and secondary single screw for two outer layers.   The core layer thickness is 1 mm and the outer layers<br><br>
have a thickness of 0.25 mm each.  Both outer layers and core layer are of the same polymer composition.<br>
Evaluation<br>
(1)	Accelerated heat aging - five strips are heat aged in oven at 110°C for 7 days and the relative loss of elongation to break is determined ((initial elongation minus final elongation), divided by initial elongation).<br>
(2)	weathering after heat aging. - In order to simulate resistance to UV/heat aging after prolonged exposure to hot conditions, five strips are humidity/heat aged in water at 85°C for 28 days to simulate extraction and hydrolysis of the additives and then exposed to artificial sunlight in a Heraeus Xenotest 1200 W WOM apparatus. The conditions are relative humidity = 60%, black panel = 60°C, 102 minutes dry cycle, 18 minutes wet cycle. The color difference (delta E) and relative loss of elongation to break ((initial elongation minus final elongation), divided by initial elongation) are measured after .10,000 hours aging. The results are summarized in TABLE 5.<br>
