a)	for a compound of formula I wherein R3 is Z-X2, X2 being OH or a residue of formula (a),<br>
removing the protecting group present in a compound of formula II<br>
 II<br>
wherein X, R1, R2 and R4 are as defined above, R'3 is Z-X2 wherein X2 is OH and R'5 is an<br>
amino protecting group, or<br>
b)	for a compound of formula I wherein R3 is Z-X2l X2 being a residue of formula (a) wherein<br>
R6 and R7 are H, removing the protecting groups present in a compound of formula III<br>
 III<br>
wherein X, R1, R2, R4 and R'5 are as defined above, and R"3 is Z-X2 wherein X2 is a residue<br>
of formula (a')<br>
wherein Z^ is as defined above and each of R'6 or R'7 is a hydrolysable or hydrogenolysable group or R'6 and R'7 form together a divalent bridging residue optionally fused to a ring (e.g. benzene ring),<br>
and, where required, converting the compounds of formula I obtained in free form into the desired salt form, or vice versa.<br>
Process step a) may be carried out in accordance with methods known in the art. The removal of the amino protecting groups may conveniently be performed according to methods known in the art, e.g. by hydrolysis, e.g. in an acidic medium, for example using hydrochloric acid. Examples of protecting groups for amino groups are e.g. as disclosed in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene, J.Wiley &amp; Sons NY, 2nd ed., chapter 7, 1991, and references therein, e.g. benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydro-pyranyl, trialkylsilyl, acyl, tert.-butoxy-carbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenyl methoxy car-bonyl, trifluoroacetyl, and the like.<br><br>
In the residue of formula (a')f each of R'6 and RV may have the significance of e.g. alkyl, e.g. tert-butyl; phenyl or benzyl or form together a cyclic system such as in 1,5-dihydro-2,4,3-benzodioxaphosphepin.<br>
Process step (b) may be performed according to methods known in the art, e.g. by hydrolysis, e.g. in a basic medium when R'6 and RV are each a hydrolysable group, for example using a hydroxide such as barium hydroxide, or in an acidic medium when R'6 and RV are each a tert-butyl group. It may also be performed by hydrogenolysis, e.g. in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. Pd/C, followed by hydrolysis, e.g. in an acidic medium, for example HCI. Compounds of formulae V and VI, used as starting materials, and salts thereof are also novel and form part of the invention.<br>
The present invention also includes a process for the preparation of a compound of formula II wherein X is O which process comprises alkylating a compound of formula IV<br>
IV<br>
wherein K1f K'3, Kj and K'5 are as denned aDove, to introduce the desired residue -R2 by an alkylation. Alkylation of the compounds of formula IV may be performed according to methods known in the art, e.g. by nucleophilic substitution, e.g. by reaction with an alkylating agent R2-X3 wherein X3 is mesylate, tosylate, triflate, nosylate or an halogen, e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide. The alkylation may also be carried out by following the Mitsunobu protocol using R2-OH (e.g. as disclosed in Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures International 28, 127-64, 1996 or D.L Hughes, Org. React. 42, 335, 1992), in solution or on solid phase support synthesis, e.g. by attaching the compound of formula IV to a resin. Alternatively, either triphenylphosphine or e.g. diethyl azocarboxylate bound to a resin, e.g. polystyrene, can be used.<br>
Insofar as the production of the starting materials is not particularly described, the compounds are known or may be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as disclosed in the Examples hereinafter.<br>

The compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. lymphocyte recirculation modulating properties, e.g. as indicated in in vitro and in vivo tests and are therefore indicated for therapy.<br>
A.	In vitro<br>
The compounds of formula I have binding affinity to individual human S1P receptors as determined in following assays:<br>
Sphinqosine-1 -phosphate (S1P) receptor profiling<br>
Agonist activities of compounds are tested on the human S1P receptors EDG-1 (SIP^, EDG-3 (S1P3), EDG-5 (S1P2), EDG-6 (S1P4) and EDG-8 (S1P5). Functional receptor activation is assessed by quantifying compound induced GTP [y-35S] binding to membrane protein prepared from transfected CHO or RH7777 cells stably expressing the appropriate human S1P receptor. The assay technology used is SPA (scintillation proximity based assay). Briefly, DMSO dissolved compounds are serially diluted and added to SPA- bead (Amersham-Pharmacia) immobilised S1P receptor expressing membrane protein (10-20^g/well) in the presence of 50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 10 pM GDP, 0.1% fat free BSA and 0.2 nM GTP [y-35S] (1200 Ci/mmol). After incubation in 96 well microtiterplates at RT for 120 min, unbound GTP [y-35S] is separated by a centrifugation step. Luminescence of SPA beads triggered by membrane bound GTP [y-35S] is quantified with a TOPcount plate reader (Packard). EC50s are calculated using standard curve fitting software. In this assay, the compounds of formula I have a binding affinity to S1P-J receptor
