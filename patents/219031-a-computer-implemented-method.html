A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHOD;<br>
INNOVATIVE SYSTEM DESIGN INC., A<br>
CORPORATION	ORGANIZED	AND<br>
EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 130 CAMPUS DRIVE, EDISON, NJ 08837, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br>
^*^	'2 1 FEB 2007<br><br>
The present invention relates generally to compute and/or network management and more particularly to an improved system, method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for graphically reporting status on a compute infrastructure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heretofore, compute infrastructure status visualization techniques involve the use of multiple and vaiious applications that are generally specialized, large and complex, all monopolizing desktop resources and usually requiring special training. Determining status on important metrics such as business, application, and technology or production issues involves interaction with one or more of these complex applications, multiple key strokes and complex application interaction to generate reports, which are then consolidated from multiple sources and summarized for management. The process is often time-consuming and cumbersome and requires special training and skills. Furthermore, the existing applications are geared for proficient computer or network operators, not managers. Because of time constraints, busy managers generally do not have time to even review the summary reports.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a further summary of the summary report. That is, a comprehensive way to visualize status on a compute infrastructure, and more particularly, a simple solution that detects status from multiple sources or<br><br><br>
metrics, consolidates them, summarizes what it consolidated and displays the entire status as a single icon on a manager's display device - desktop, from which the underlying detail can be displayed via drilldown. The drilldown should include certain critical information, so that managers can take appropriate action when necessary.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present solution addresses the aforementioned problems of the prior art by providing for, among other things, an improved apparatus, method and article of manufacture for visualizing status of important metrics. Specifically, there is provided herein an exemplary technique utilizing at least one status icon for visually reporting the status of at least the important metrics of a resource, e.g., one or more applications running within a compute infrastructure. In an exemplary embodiment, the application status icon is located on a device display, preferably as part of a graphical user interface icon tray, such as Microsoft© Windows® system tray. To generate the appropriate color of the application status icon, several predefined tests or database queries are executed to determine the status of a desired application. Thereafter, the determined status is compared to a plurality of threshold conditions, which determine the state of a given status metric and contribute to the overall color of the application status icon, preferably<br>
3<br><br>
located on the display device. Thus, a user or manager need not run an application to check its status. Instead, the manager neqd only view the color of the application status icon on the display device to determine the overall health of a plurality of underlying metrics, which contribute to the creation of the application status icon's color.<br>
If a problem exists with any metric color of the single main application, the icon changes from good to bad. A problem is defined as one or more metrics falling outside the range of a predefined and acceptable threshold condition. Upon drilldown, the color of the icon used to present the metric is also changed from good to bad.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring briefly to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1,2 and 3 illustrate certain aspects and features of the present solution.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention may be embodied in the graphical image/interface, method of operation and article of manufacture or product, generally shown in Figures I, 2<br>
4<br><br>
and 3. It will be appreciated that the graphical image/interface, method of operation and article of manufacture may vary as to the details of its representative. icons (a square may be a circle), configuration (the exict screen layout may be adjusted) and operation without departing from the basic concepts disclosed herein.. The following description, which follows with reference to certain embodiments herein, is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.<br>
There is provided herein an exemplary method utilizing at least one status icon for visually reporting the status of at least the important metrics of a resource, e.g., one or more applications running within a compute infrastructure. The status icon also implements a real time summary drill-down Status report of the resource, e.g. an application.   In an exemplary embodiment, the status icon is located on a device display, preferably as part of a grapbical user interface icon tray, such as Microsoft® Windows® system tray.   .<br>
Figure I depicts the status icon as part of the Microsoft® Windows® system tray. The icon can be programmed to summarize the state of multiple metrics over various time intervals. For example, at Time 1, 2 and 3, the status icon is red, reflecting a bad state. At Time 4, the status icon is green, reflecting a good state. Preferably, a single graphical icon is utilized to summarize the state of the underlying metrics within a compute infrastructure. Thus, if the icon is green, thus indicating a good state, management can be assured that the important<br>
5"<br><br>
metrics of the given resource(s) are good. Alternatively, if the icon is red, thus indicating a bad state, management can take-action with the appropriate people.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the first level of drilldown for taking action when the icon is red, thus indicating a bad state. The first level of drilldown for taking action is the main status window/object (hereinafter referred to as application main status screen). The application main status screen is accessed and displayed when the user selects/clicks on the status icon. Each metric icon displayed in the application main status screen, represents a single metric or a container of multiple metrics.   The states of the metrics contribute collectively to the overall state reported by the status icon. A single metric might also be associated with a test or query that can aggregate multiple "hidden" metrics and summarize the results into a single value (e.g. Service Levels).<br>
Figure 2 also depicts the various resources/applications running on the computing device. Many of these applications are also depicted in the system tray together with the status icon. Using the system tray elevates the executive level attention for metrics contained in this application, constantly reporting their status in real time. This allows the status for important issues, reflected in the state of important metrics to be elevated above the "noise" of the other applications on the busy display device.<br><br><br>
Also shown in Figure 2, prior use of the system tray uses single icons to represent the state of single applications (e.g. NetMeetmg) or monitors (e;g. GPU Usage).  This invention uses a single icon to represent the state of multiple and dissimilar metrics from multiple.and dissimilar sources, presented and summarized to management as a single icon.  This makes better use of the system tray, leveraging the fact that the system tray is always visible, to allow important metrics to also always be visiblo to management.<br>
Figure 3 depicts self explanatory details that are used to manage metrics. Not.illustrated, but disclosed is the graphing of historical metric data in a variety of formats (e.g. line, bar, pie) charts.<br>
