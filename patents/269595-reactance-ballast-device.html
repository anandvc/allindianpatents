				<td>Description<br>
Reactance ballast device<br>
The invention relates to a reactance ballast device for an arc<br>
furnace, in particular for setting the additional reactance of<br>
a transformer of the arc furnace.<br>
An arc furnace, as is used, for example, for melting steel,<br>
generally has a transformer connected upstream of it, which<br>
transformer sets an AC voltage required for the arc. Since very<br>
high powers are consumed by an arc furnace and high AC voltages<br>
need to be transmitted by the transformers connected upstream,<br>
such transformers are generally introduced into an insulating<br>
material in order to avoid flashovers.<br>
An important characteristic in the case	of AC voltage and<br>
alternating current is the reactance, i.e.	the reactance of a<br>
conductor, for example in the case of a	coil through which<br>
current is flowing.<br>
For various operational states of an arc furnace it is<br>
desirable to be able to set different reactances. For this<br>
purpose it is known to integrate an apparatus for setting the<br>
reactance with an induction coil and with an on-load tap<br>
changer in the transformer which is connected upstream.<br>
Typically, such apparatuses with the coils and the active part<br>
of the transformer are introduced into a tank filled with<br>
insulating material.<br>
It is further known for an arc furnace plant without an<br>
additional reactance introduced into the transformer tank to<br>
use air-core induction coils positioned outside the<br>
transformer, for example in an outdoor switchgear assembly, as<br>
the additional reactance.<br><br><br>
However, it is not possible to use additional reactances<br>
designed in this way to set an optimum reactance for all<br>
operational states of the arc furnace on load.<br>
Many arc furnace plants are therefore operated in practice with<br>
a fixedly preselected reactance. The induction coil used for<br>
this purpose has at least one tap, which taps off the current<br>
flowing through the coil after a specific turns number and<br>
therefore assigns a reactance which is set in a defined manner<br>
to the transformer. For assignment of the desired reactance,<br>
the tap has fixed wiring. However, it is necessary for a change<br>
to be made if it is identified after a relatively long period<br>
of operation that the selected series reactance has not been<br>
optimally set during operation on load, i.e. during operation<br>
of the furnace, which results, for example, in an unnecessary<br>
increase in the consumption of energy, or that the reactance<br>
should be matched in a process-dependent manner. It is<br>
disadvantageously necessary for this purpose for the power<br>
supply to be switched off, and therefore for the furnace plant<br>
to be shut down and for the transformer to be wired to another<br>
tap on the induction coil.<br>
A first object of the invention is to specify an apparatus<br>
which makes it possible to easily set the reactance connected<br>
upstream in particular of a transformer.<br>
A second object of the invention is to specify a transformer<br>
which can be used to set the reactance as precisely as<br>
possible.<br>
A third object of the invention is to	specify an arc furnace,<br>
in particular for melting steel, which	is supplied with energy<br>
in a manner which is as optimal and economical as possible<br>
during operation on load.<br><br>
The first object is achieved according to the invention by the<br>
fact that a reactance ballast device is specified, in<br>
particular for an arc furnace, with an induction coil and with<br>
a free-standing on-load tap changer, the on-load tap<br><br><br><br>
changer being formed and designed to set the reactance of the<br>
induction coil on load.<br>
The combination of an induction coil with a free-standing on-<br>
load tap changer in accordance with the invention makes it<br>
possible to set the series reactance on load, with the result<br>
that the optimum series or additional reactance can always be<br>
selected corresponding to the operational requirements, in<br>
particular when applied to the operation on load of an arc<br>
furnace.<br>
The reactance ballast device is not restricted to the use<br>
thereof for setting the reactance for an arc furnace or for a<br>
transformer of an arc furnace. It can also be connected<br>
upstream of other energy consumers or plants, whose<br>
characteristics are determined in particular by the reactance.<br>
Advantageously, a free-standing dry-insulated air-core<br>
induction coil is selected for the reactance ballast device.<br>
Dry-insulated air-core induction coils do not make use of any<br>
insulating oils, as a result of which the general complexity in<br>
terms of maintenance and risk of fire is reduced and thus the<br>
efficiency and environmental friendliness is increased.<br>
Furthermore, the induction coil has a suitable number of<br>
tapping points, each of which has an assigned turns number of<br>
the coil. Since the inductance and therefore the impedance of a<br>
coil depends on the number of turns through which a coil<br>
current passes, tapping of the alternating current passing<br>
through the coil at a tapping point can be used to predetermine<br>
the coil impedance and therefore the reactance, i.e. the<br>
reactance in the case of alternating current, in graduated<br>
fashion, corresponding to the graduations of the tapping<br>
points.<br><br>
In a preferred development of the reactance ballast device, the<br>
free-standing on-load tap changer combined with the induction<br>
coil has a number of input contacts, at least one output<br>
contact and a switching element.<br><br>
In this case, the switching element is designed to alternately<br>
and variably connect at least one input contact to an output<br>
contact. In the case of a plurality of input contacts, the<br>
switching element can therefore connect in each case one or<br>
more input contacts to an output contact, depending on the<br>
configuration. By respective setting of the switching element,<br>
the output at the or at an output contact is therefore<br>
controlled. The on-load tap changer also comprises a container<br>
with an insulating material, which container is formed and<br>
designed to accommodate the switching element. The insulating<br>
material avoids a flashover as a result of high voltages. The<br>
insulating properties of the insulating material reduces the<br>
spark gap, with the result that the physical size is overall<br>
reduced.<br>
The switching element correspondingly has a number of inputs<br>
and at least one output, with one or each output having an<br>
assigned branching node, at which at least two branches of a<br>
bridge circuit converge, the branches in each case being<br>
capable of being deactivated at switching points, the branches<br>
in each case being capable of being connected variably to the<br>
inputs, and in each case being connected in pairs to a load<br>
switching point, in particular to a vacuum interrupter, via a<br>
cross connection.<br>
At the branching node assigned to an output of the switching<br>
element, the branches belonging to a bridge circuit converge,<br>
with a bridge circuit comprising at least two branches. The<br>
branches produce the contact to the inputs of the switching<br>
element, and in the process can be contact-connected<br>
individually to various inputs, with the result that a<br>
plurality of branches is present at one input or only in each<br>
case one branch is present at each input. In particular, the<br>
variable contact-making can be achieved by the branches being<br>
shifted between various inputs. If all of the branches are<br><br>
present at one input or all of the branches are in contact with<br>
this input, a step position is predetermined. If, on the other<br>
hand, two branches are present at two different inputs, a<br>
bridge position is<br><br><br><br>
defined. In the case of only two branches, there is only one<br>
step position and one bridge position. A switching element<br>
formed in such a way makes it possible to switch on load, the<br>
switching from one step position to another taking place<br>
successively via the formation of bridge positions.<br>
The branches of the bridge circuit of the switching element are<br>
connected in pairs to cross connections, which can be<br>
deactivated via in each case one load switching point. For<br>
their part the branches are each provided with switching points<br>
between the branching nodes and the cross connections. If<br>
switching points on individual branches are now deactivated,<br>
for example in order to shift these branches from in each case<br>
one to in each case another input, the cross connections<br>
connected to these branches first take over the load and<br>
additionally can compensate for current and voltage<br>
fluctuations in the region of the branching node and prevent<br>
overloads from occurring there during switching. Now, the cross<br>
connections can be deactivated at the load switching points and<br>
the branches which have thus been decoupled from the current<br>
flow can be shifted. The load switching points are preferably<br>
provided by vacuum interrupters since vacuum interrupters<br>
function reliably as load switches as a result of the shielding<br>
effect of the vacuum and are subject to little wear. In<br>
addition, expediently the branches between the cross<br>
connections and the input-side contact points are provided with<br>
induction elements, which ensure a substantially uniform load<br>
distribution in the circuit in a bridge configuration.<br>
A desired configuration of the reactance ballast device is to<br>
this extent one in which the number of tapping points of the<br>
induction coil corresponds to the number of input contacts of<br>
the on-load tap changer and in each case one tapping point is<br>
connected to an input contact. In this case, the assignment of<br>
the tapping points to the input contacts is preferably linear<br><br>
with the result that counting of the input contacts in a<br>
predetermined sequence corresponds to the increasing or<br>
decreasing reactance of the induction coil. There is<br><br>
therefore a desired unique assignment between the reactance<br>
steps and the input contacts.<br>
Furthermore, a unique assignment between the input and output<br>
contacts of the on-load tap changer and the inputs and outputs<br>
of the switching element is expediently provided. Thus in<br>
particular the inputs of the switching element are uniquely<br>
assigned to the reactance steps. The switching element as part<br>
of the on-load tap changer therefore represents series<br>
reactance matching of the transformer via the choice of steps<br>
of the tapping points of the induction coil.<br>
The second object is achieved according to the invention by a<br>
transformer, in particular for an arc furnace, which has an<br>
assigned reactance ballast device in accordance with the type<br>
mentioned at the outset.<br>
An additional apparatus for setting the reactance with an<br>
induction coil and with an on-load tap changer is<br>
advantageously integrated in the transformer.<br>
The third object is achieved according to the invention by	an<br>
arc furnace, in particular for melting steel, with	a<br>
transformer of the abovementioned type connected upstream	of<br>
said arc furnace.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be explained in<br>
more detail below with reference to a drawing, in which, in<br>
each case in a schematic illustration:<br>
figure 1 shows a reactance ballast device with an air-core<br>
induction coil and an on-load tap changer,<br>
figure 2 shows the switching process of a switching element<br>
between a step position and a bridge position in six<br>
individual figures A to F, and<br><br>
figure 3 shows a single-line schematic of an arc furnace with<br>
a transformer and a reactance ballast device of the<br>
type mentioned at the outset.<br><br><br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates a reactance ballast device V with an air-<br>
core induction coil 1 and with a free-standing on-load tap<br>
changer 2, as a whole. The air-core induction coil 1 is<br>
connected to a mains power supply via the feed point 3 and has<br>
been provided with a number of uniformly distributed tapping<br>
points 4, via which the current flowing through the air-core<br>
induction coil 1 can in each case be tapped off after a<br>
multiple of a uniformly sized subsection of the coil flow. If<br>
appropriate, the air-core induction coil 1 is introduced into a<br>
container 5, which in this case is illustrated by dashed lines.<br>
The free-standing on-load tap changer 2 has a steel housing 6,<br>
whose interior 7 has been filled with an insulating material,<br>
in particular oil. The on-load tap changer 2 has been provided<br>
with a number of input contacts 8, which are wired to the<br>
tapping points 4 of the air-core induction coil 1. In the<br>
interior 7 of the steel housing 6, the input contacts 8<br>
represent inputs for a switching element 9 which is localized<br>
there and which in this case can be shifted variably as a<br>
whole. The output of the switching element 9 is passed to the<br>
outside via an output contact 10 and is connected to a<br>
transformer of an arc furnace via a mains line 11. As a result<br>
of a defined shift of the switching element 9 with respect to a<br>
specific input contact 8 and the corresponding tapping point 4,<br>
the load circuit of the reactance ballast device V is closed<br>
between the feed point 3 and the output line 11. Thus, the<br>
reactance 4 assigned to the tapping point 4 of the air-core<br>
induction coil 1 is made available at the output line 11.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of the switching<br>
process of a switching element 9 shown in figure 1 between a<br>
step position and a bridge position in the switching phases A<br>
to F. First of all the components of the switching element 9<br>
will be explained in detail with reference to the figure<br>
relating to switching phase A which components have been<br><br><br><br>
provided in similar fashion for the remaining switching phases<br>
B to F. For reasons of clarity, the components of the switching<br>
element 9 have only been provided with reference symbols<br><br><br><br>
in the figures relating to switching phases B to F where it is<br>
necessary for explaining the switching process.<br>
The switching element 9 illustrated in figure 2 is connected to<br>
the tapping point 4 of the air-core induction coil 1 via the<br>
on-load tap changer 2, as can be seen in figure 1. Figure 2<br>
illustrates two inputs 121, 12r of the switching element 9,<br>
which are assigned to the input contacts 8 of the on-load tap<br>
changer 2 in figure 1. In the illustration, the switching<br>
element 9 has a left-hand line branch or branch 131 and a<br>
right-hand line branch or branch 13r, which have each been<br>
provided with induction coils 141, 14r, and are each connected<br>
to toggle switches 161, 16r with a branching node 17 via<br>
contact points 151, 15r. The branching node 17 leads to the<br>
output 21 of the switching element 9. In each case between the<br>
induction coils 141, 14r and the contact points 151, 15r there<br>
is a cross connection 18 with a vacuum interrupter 20 between<br>
the line branches 131 and 13r, which are each connected thereto<br>
at the connection points 191 and 19r. The arrows S indicate the<br>
inverse direction of flow.<br>
The switching operation can be seen from the individual<br>
switching phases A to F:<br>
A The switching element 9 is located in step position at the<br>
input 121. Both branches 131 and 13r are at the input 121.<br>
The toggle switches 161 and 16r are in the closed position<br>
at the respective contact points 151 and 15r, with the<br>
result that the two branches 131 and 13r are on load. The<br>
induction coils 141 and 14r ensure a symmetrical load<br>
distribution between the branches 131 and 13r.<br>
B The toggle switch 16r is	opened, and the contact is capped<br>
at the contact point	15r. As a result, the cross<br>
connection 18 is on	load via the closed vacuum<br>
interrupter 20.<br><br><br><br>
C The vacuum interrupter 20 is interrupted, and the<br>
branch 13r is off load and can be shifted; the entire load<br>
is on the branch 131.<br>
D The off-load branch 13r is shifted from the input 121 to<br>
the input 12r.<br>
E The vacuum interrupter 20 is closed; the cross<br>
connection 18 and the branch 13r are on load again; the<br>
bridge position is active since the inputs 121 and 12r now<br>
simultaneously produce a closed cycle via the branching<br>
point 17.<br>
F The toggle switch 16r is closed again; the contact is<br>
produced again at the contact point 15r. The bridge<br>
position is realized via the two contact points 151<br>
and 15r, instead of via the cross connection 18.<br>
In the inverse sequence with respect to the sequence A to F and<br>
mirror-symmetrically with respect thereto, the branch 131 can<br>
now be shifted in order to produce a step position of the two<br>
branches 131, 13r at the input 12r.<br>
In this way, the bridge circuit of the switching element 9 via<br>
the formation of bridge positions at various inputs makes it<br>
possible to shift from step position to step position between<br>
these various inputs on load.<br>
Figure 3 shows an arc furnace 0 with a furnace transformer T<br>
and a reactance ballast device V of the type mentioned at the<br>
outset with an induction coil 1 and an on-load tap changer 2.<br><br><br><br>
