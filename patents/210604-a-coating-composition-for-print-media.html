COATING COMPOSITION CONTAINING BEADS OF HIGH<br>
REFRACTIVE INDEX<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to a coating composition for print media. The present invention is further directed to improved print substrates having the coating composition thereon and methods of making the improved print substrates. The improved print substrates substantially enhance the brightness and brilliance of colorants applied to the coating composition, especially compared to colorants applied to conventional coated or uncoated print media.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The influence of a substrate on colorant brightness and brilliance can be extremely important. Conventional print substrates typically contain filler materials and/or surface coatings in order to improve the brightness and brilliance of colorants applied thereto. Although many attempts have been made to enhance the brightness and brilliance of colorants, the attempts have resulted in less than acceptable color quality.<br>
There exists a need for methods and compositions, which are capable of enhancing the brightness and brilliance of a wide variety of colorants, especially magenta colorants. There also exists a need for improved substrates, which are<br><br>
providing superior, color quality by enhancing the brightness and brilliance of colorants applied thereto.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the needs described above by providing a coating composition and an improved print substrate coated with the composition. The coating composition contains unique microspheres having a refractive index of from about 1.9 to about 2.4. Colorants applied to the improved print substrate exhibit exceptional brightness and brilliance compared to conventional print substrates. In addition, the present invention provides a coating that is elastic and does not cause the substrate to curl when heat is applied.<br>
The present invention is also directed to methods of making the composition and improved substrates described above. Superior color quality, print vibrancy, and colorant brilliance is achieved by combining the aforementioned improved substrates and any colorant composition, particularly ink jet inks.<br>
These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a coating composition for print media. The present invention is also directed to improved print substrates comprising a base layer and the above coating composition on at least one surface of the base layer. The improved substrates substantially enhance the brightness and brilliant of colorants applied to the coating composition on the substrate, especially compared to colorants applied to conventional coated or uncoated print media. The present invention is further directed to improved print<br><br>
substrates having the above coating composition thereon and methods of making the improved print substrates.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention comprises microspheres, or beads, having a refractive index of from about 1.9 to about 2.4. The beads are available from The Photographic Institute, Beijing, China, and comprise significant amounts (greater than about 1.0 weight percent) of titanium, barium, calcium and oxygen; minor amounts (less than about 1.0 weight percent) of aluminum, iron, strontium, zinc, and zirconium; and possibly minute amounts of sodium, tellurium, and other elements. An electron microprobe analysis of a bead sample reveals the following bead composition as shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
The commercially available beads are desirably substantially spherical and have particle diameters ranging from about 2 microns to about 45 microns, although having a variety of sizes is not critical to the present invention. As used herein, the phrase "substantially spherical" is intended to encompass beads having a perfectly spherical shape, as well as, beads having an imperfect spherical shape, such as wherein the bead length may be slightly larger or smaller than the bead breath. In one embodiment of the present invention, the commercially available beads are mechanically separated into<br><br>
samples having relatively narrow particle diameter ranges. For example, one sample comprises beads having a particle diameter range of about 27 to about 45 microns. Another sample comprises beads having a particle diameter range of about 2 to about 43 microns. Coating compositions of the present invention may be prepared using commercially available beads or select beads having a desired particle size or particle size range.<br>
Image analysis of two bead samples is given below. All units are in microns.<br><br>
As shown by the above data. Sample 1 has a broad particle size distribution from about 1 to about 45 microns, while Sample 2 has a much narrower particle size distribution from about 25 to about 45 microns.   In both samples, the<br><br>
equivalent circular diameter (area equivalent diameter) is very close to the particle length and breath, indicating that the beads are almost perfectly spherical particles.<br>

The coating composition is coated onto the base layer by any conventional coating method including, but not limited to, rod coating, dip coating, spray coating, gravure coating, knife coating, slot coating, and roller coating. Desirably, the coating composition is applied to the base layer by a process wherein the coating composition is transferred from a bath onto a roller which extends into the bath, and onto at least one surface of the base layer. Optionally, the same or a different coating may be provided on the same or an opposite side of the base layer. The coated base layer then passes under or over a rod, which meters excess coating from the base layer. Once coated, the base layer is dried in a conventional oven or by any other means known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The amount of coating composition applied to a surface of the base layer may vary depending upon the type of base layer used and the application of the final product. For example, a base layer in the form of an uncoated paper may require more coating composition than a base layer in the form of a coated paper or film due to the increased porosity of the base layer. Desirably, the coating composition is applied to a base layer to produce a coating weight of from about 3.0 to about 60.0 g/m2 of base layer surface area. In some embodiments, the coating weight is from about 9.0 to about 23.0 g/m2 of base layer surface area. In other embodiments, the coating weight is from about 15.0 to about 20.0 g/m2 of base layer surface area.<br>
The thickness of the coating composition may also vary depending upon the type of base layer used and the application of the final product. Desirably, the coating composition has a thickness of about 0.1 to about 5.0 mil. In some embodiments, the coating composition has a thickness of about 0.5 to about<br><br>
2.0 mil.   In other embodiments, the coating composition has a thickness of about 1.0 to about 1.5 mil.<br>
The present invention is further described by the examples which follow. Such examples, however, are not to be construed as limiting in any way either the spirit or scope of the present invention. In the examples, all parts are parts by weight unless stated otherwise.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Bead/PVOH Composition<br>
A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.1 g of beads having a composition as shown in Table 1 above and 1.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (PVOH) (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products). After stirring for 5 minutes on a hot plate, the solution converted to an elastic rubber-like material. The material was capable of being stretched approximately 3 feet without breaking. The elastic material was coated onto a sheet of paper and air dried.<br>
Magenta ink was applied to the coated sheet. Magenta ink was also applied to a second uncoated sheet or paper. The magenta ink on the coated paper was noticeably brighter than the magenta ink on the uncoated paper.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of TiO2/PVOH Composition<br>
For comparison to the coating composition of Example 1, a coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.1 g of Ti02 powder (TITANDIOXID P25, DEGUSSA) and 1.0 g of a<br>
10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (PVOH) (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products). After stirring for 5 minutes on a hot plate, the solution thickened but did not result in an elastic rubber-like material.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Bead/PVOH/Cyclodextrin Composition A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.1 g of beads, 1.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products), 1.0 g of y-cyclodextrin, y-CD, (Cerestar) and 1.0 g of water. The components were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes, forming an elastic rubber-like material. A sample of the elastic material was applied with a No. 40 rod onto a sheet of glossy paper and dried to form a highly reflective coating having a textured surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Preparation ofBead/PVOH Composition<br>
A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.5 g of beads, 3.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products) and 1.0 g of water. The components were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes, forming an elastic rubber-like material. A sample of the elastic material was stored at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes, forming a clear rubber material.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of Bead/PVOH/Cyclodextrin Composition<br>
A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.3 g of beads, 1.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products), 1.0 g of y-cyclodextrin, y-CD, (Cerestar) and 1.0 g of water. The components were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes, forming an elastic rubber-like material. A sample of the elastic material was stored at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, forming a latex rubber material.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 Preparation of Bead/PVOH/Cyclodextrin Composition A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.11 g of beads, 1.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products), 1.0 g of hydroxyethyl β -cyclodextrin, he-β -CD, (Cerestar) and 1.0 g of water. The PVOH, he-p-CD and water were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes. The beads were added to the mixture, which was stirred for three minutes and heated on a hot plate for five minutes. Upon cooling, the mixture formed a very elastic rubber-like material. A sample of the elastic material was applied with a No. 7 rod onto a sheet of glossy paper and dried to form a highly reflective coating having a smooth surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Preparation of Bead/PVOH/Cyclodextrin Composition<br>
A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.05 g of beads, 1.0 g of a 10% solution of polyvinylalcohol (AIRVOL® 523, Air Products), 2.0 g of hydroxyethyl β -cyclodextrin, he-p-CD, (Cerestar) and 1.0 g of water. The PVOH, he-β -CD and water were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes. The beads were slowly added to the mixture, which was stirred for three minutes and heated on a hot plate for five minutes. Upon cooling, the mixture thickened, but did not form an elastic rubber-like material having remarkable stretch, most likely due to the higher concentration of cyclodextrin.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Preparation of Bead/PVOH/Cyclodextrin Composition<br>
A coating composition was formulated by mixing 0.05 g<br>
of beads,   1.0  g of a   10%   solution  of  polyvinylalcohol<br>
(AIRVOL® 523, Air Products), 3.0 g of hydroxyethyl P-<br>
cyclodextrin, he-p-CD, (Cerestar) and 1.0 g of water.    The<br><br>
PVOH, he-(3-CD and water were stirred in a beaker at room temperature for five minutes. The beads were slowly added to the mixture, which was stirred for three minutes and heated on a hot plate for five minutes. Upon cooling, the mixture thickened and had less stretch than in Example 7.<br>
