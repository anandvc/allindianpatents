ENANTIOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS OF AZETIDINONE INTERMEDIATE<br>
COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing intermediates for hydroxy-alkyl substituted azetidinones. Hydroxy-alkyl substituted azetidinones, for example, 1-(4-fluoropheny!)-3(RH3(S}-hydroxy-3-(4-fluorophenyI)propyl)]-4(S}-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-azetidinone, are described in US Patent No. 5,767,115. These compounds are useful as hypochoiesterolemic agents in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.<br>
Processes for preparing the corresponding azetidinone without the 3-hydroxy substituent are claimed in US Patent No. 5,728,827 and US Patent No. 5,561,227. Other processes for preparing 1-(4-fluorophenyI)-3(R)-[3(S)-hydroxy-3-(4-fluoropheny!}-propy!)]-4{SH4-hydroxyphenyI)-2-azetidinone are disclosed in US Patent No. 5,631,365. US Patent No. 5,739,321 and US Patent No. 6,207,822 B1 (the •822 patent).<br>
As per the procedure described in the '822 patent, the intermediate compound of Formula I, is protected with a suitable hydroxy-protecting group, such as a silyl protecting group such as that derived from chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCI) or t-butyldimethyl-silyl chloride (TBDMSCI). This silylated product is further reacted with a silyl-enol ether silyiating agent such as bistrimethylsilyl acetamide (BSA). A cyclizing agent such as a quaternary alkyl-, aryl-alkyl or arylalkyl-alkylammonium fluoride salt is then added to cause an intra-molecular cyclization of the previously silylated compound of Formula I. Finally, the protecting groups are removed from the cyclizied compound using conventional methods, such as treatment with a dilute acid, in order to form the hypochoiesterolemic azetidinone having the Formula<br><br><br>

Except where stated otherwise, the following definitions apply throughout the present specification and claims. These definitions apply regardless of whether a term is used by itself or in combination with other terms. Hence the definition of "alky!" applies to "alkyl" as well as to the "alkyT portions of "alkoxy", ualkyIaminoB etc.<br><br>

In another embodiment of the alternate process (with no acid in step (a)) described immediately above, the ratio of the catalyst to the compound of Formula II<br><br>
of step b) is in a mole % of 0.1-10%, preferably 1-5%, more preferably in a mole % of 2-3%.<br><br>
The present invention discloses a novel chemo selective and stereo selective reduction of the ketone adjacent to the p-fluorophenyl using a BH3-THF complex. In a previous process patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,207,822 B1 (the '822 patent), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto, there is disclosed a reduction of said ketone using BH3 Me2S (BMS) complex as a reducing agent However, use of said BMS complex may lead to environmental concerns. The replacement of BMS with borane tetrahydrofuran complex eliminates the environmental issues raised by use of the BMS complex.<br>
However, simple replacement of BH3 Me2S with BH3-THF in the reduction generated a substantial amount of over-reduction of the amide bond, compared to the reduction of the ketone adjacent to the p-fluororophenyl, thus resulting in poor selectivity. Thus, initial experiments with BH3-THF yielded a desirable % of desired enantiomer (SS) to the undesired enantiomer (SR)t however, the solution yield was not optimized due to the production of the above-noted over-reduced by-product from the amide. Applicants found, in the present process, that reversing the addition sequence surprisingly overcame the poor chemoselectivity in the reduction. The production of the over-reduced by-product from the amide was significantly reduced while at the same time resulting in high diasteroselectivity in the product.<br>
The new process calls for adding BH3-THF to the solution of Formula II and (R)-tetrahydro-1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1H?3H-pyrrolo[1f2-c] [1,3,2] oxazaborolidine (abbreviated as (R)-MeCBS) catalyst in THF (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri).<br><br>
Several experiments yielded results where the over-reduced by-product was minimized to 
The following examples used to prepare the compound of Formula I illustrate the present invention, although such examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Alternative reagents and analogous processes within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The product solutions of the following examples (which contain the compound of Formula I) can be directly used as such in subsequent process steps to make hydroxy-alkyi substituted azetidinones, or in the alternative, the compounds of Formula I can be crystallized or isolated using methods known and recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Fifty (50) g of the compound of Formula II was charged into a 1000 mL three necked round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer, N2 inlet and addition funnel. 500 mL THF was charged to dissolve the 50 g of the compound Formula II at about 20° to 25°C. The batch was concentrated at 1 atm to a batch volume of about 150 mL. The temperature was adjusted to about 20° to 25°C. 4.2 mL of lab pre-formed (R)-MeCBS catalyst in toluene (3 mole%) was charged. 70.4 mL of 1M borane THF complex in THF solution (from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was slowly charged over 1.5 hrs at temperature between about 23° and 28°C. The batch was sampled for HPLC to monitor the progress of the reaction. After the reaction was judged complete, 20 mL of MeOH was slowly charged to keep the temperature below 25°C in order to quench the reaction. The batch was concentrated under vacuum to afford a batch volume of about 100 mL at a temperature below 40°C. 250 mL of toluene and a solution of 5 mL sulfuric acid in 100 mL water was charged. The mixture was agitated for about 10 min. and the batch was allowed to settle. The bottom acid layer was split off. 100 mL of water was charged to wash the batch twice. The batch was concentrated under vacuum at below 50°C to afford a volume of about 100 mL. Results varied, but in general, yields of -99% and 95% de were obtained.<br>

Example 4 Acid (CSA) present in step (a))<br>
Thirty (30) g of the compound of Formula II and 0.386 g (2 mole %) of (1SM+M0-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) was charged in a 500 rnL 3 necked round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer, N2 inlet and addition funnel. 111 mL of dry THF was charged to dissolve the 30 g of the compound Formula II, and the (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid at about 20 to 25°C. 2.2 mL of pre formed (R )-MCBS catalyst in toluene (3 mole %) was charged. 39.9 mL of 1M borane THF complex in THF solution was slowly charged over 1.5 hours at a temperature range between about 23 and 28°C. The batch was sampled for HPLC to monitor the progress of the reaction. After the reaction was judged complete, using the same subsequent procedure as described in Example 1 (i.e. quenching with MeOH, vacuum concentration of the batch, etc., but in appropriate ratios of reagents for this example), the compound of<br><br>
Formula i was obtained. Results varied, but in general, -99% yield and -94% de were obtained.<br>
Example 5<br>
Using the method described above in example 4, other acids were substituted for CSA. This group of other acids included BF3.OEt2, BCI3, trifiuoroacetic acid (7FA) or methansulfonic acid.
