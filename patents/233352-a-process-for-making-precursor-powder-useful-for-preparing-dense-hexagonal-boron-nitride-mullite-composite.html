				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making precursor powders useful for preparing dense hexagonal boron nitride - mullite and a process for preparing dense hexagonal boron nitride - mullite composite useful for making industrial components.<br>
The main usages of the hexagonal boron nitride-mullite composite is in the field of engineering ceramics such as producing parts of gas jets, bushes of muffle furnace, as a material for absorbing thermal neutron, for bio-protection in nuclear equipment and refractory items such as heat insulating and refractory materials for producing refractory ceramic items, for metallurgical and chemical industries.<br>
There is no known method of making precursor powder useful for making dense boron nitride-mullite composite, though dense hexagonal boron nitride products are known where boron oxide or different boron containing glasses are used as compositing material. The present day processes of making such products essentially consists of mixing additives with hexagonal boron nitride by wet or dry mixing, forming shapes by conventional shaping processes, sintering in inert atmosphere mostly by hot pressing, references for which may be made to "Special Ceramics" Edited by P. Popper ( Heywood, London, 1960 ) pp 144, by T. A. Ingles and P. Popper, "Sci Ceram", Vol. 11, 1981, pp 251, by D. Launary and Thevenot, "Ind. Engg. Chem", Vol. 47, 1955, pp 2506, by K. M. Taylor, "Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSRNeorg. Mater", Vol 11, 1975, pp 1778, by I. G. Kuzenetsova et al., "Ceram Engg. Sci. Proc.", Vol 6, 1985, pp 1305, by D. Fister, or by mechanochemical treatment followed by pressureless sintering references for which may be made to "Sintering and crystallisation of ground hexagonal boron nitride powders", "J. Mat. Sc. Let.", Vol 13,1994, pp 653-55, by T. Hagio and H. Yoshida.<br><br>
The main draw back of the above processes may be listed as below.<br>
1.	The process require inert atmosphere for sintering.<br>
2.	Hot pressing is frequently required for adequate densification.<br>
3.	Sintering temperature is higher.<br>
4.	Bonding or composite phases are of comparatively low fusion range.<br>
5.	Homogeneity of the product is difficult to maintain.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of making precursor powders<br>
useful for preparing dense hexagonal boron nitride - mullite composite and a process for<br>
preparing dense hexagonal boron nitride mullite composite,  which obviates the draw back as<br>
detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to process the raw materials thorough hydrogel route to<br>
impart greater homogenity to the fired products.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of a inert atmosphere for<br>
sintering of the products.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the sintering temperature of the products.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to increase the fusion-range of the compositing<br>
phases present in the product.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides, a process for making precursor powder, useful for preparing dense hexagonal boron nitride-mullite composite and comprising boron nitride, silicon and aluminium , which comprises making a slurry of fine silica and boron nitride in aluminium salt solution such as herein described, at a concentration ranging 5-40%, converting the slurry into a gel-like mass by ammonia at a pH ranging 10-11 , ageing the gel-like mass for a period in the range of 24 - 48 hours , washing the resultant solid followed by drying at a temperature range 110 + 5°C , for a period in the range of 24 - 36 hours, calcining the dried mass at temperature in the range of 800° - 950°C for a period in the range of 1 - 5 hours, grinding the calcined mass to pass 100 British Standard mesh to get the desired precursor powder<br>
I an embodiment hexagonal boron nitride-mullite composite may be prepared using obtained powder by conventional manner at a temperature in the range of 1250-1550 ° C in air atmosphere.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention aluminium salt used may be such as nitrate, chloride, sulphate.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention concentration of aluminium salt solution may be maintained in the range of 0.5 - 1.5 (M).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention ammonia may be used as gaseous or in water solution. The details of the process of the present invention are given below.<br>
-	Boron nitride powder is mixed with aluminium nitrate solution with constant stirring.<br>
-	Very fine silica powder is added in the boron nitride suspension prepared in step 'a'.<br>
-	The entire mixture is strried for 2 - 12 hours.<br>
-	Ammonium hydroxide solution is slowly added in the mixture produced by step 'a' -<br>
' c'till pH is 10.5-11.0.<br>
-	The entire mass converts to semisolid gel-like mass which is allowed to age for 24<br>
- 48 hrs.<br><br>
f)	Product formed in step 'e' is filtered and washed by deionised water.<br>
g)	The washed material is dried at 110 + 5°C for 24 hrs.<br>
h) The dried material obtained in step 'g' is heat treated at 800-850°C for 2-4 hrs in air<br>
environment.<br>
i) The heat treated product is ground and sieved through 100 mesh B.S.<br>
j) The sieved powder is formed into green shape by cold isostatic pressing.<br>
k) The green pressed product is fired in air environment at 1200-1400°C for 1-5 hrs.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used for making precurser powders useful for<br>
preparing dense Hexagonal Boron Notride - Mullite &amp; a process for preparing Dense Hexagonal<br>
Boron Nitride Mullite Composite,     of various shapes and sizes required for   application as<br>
engineering and refractory material.<br>
Hexagonal boron nitride is essentially a non-sinterable covalent compound with flaky structure.<br>
It is frequently converted to a dense body by incorporating low melting boron containing glasses.<br>
High level of grinding of HBN was also claimed to be another effective means of making the<br>
powder sinterable. However, a second compatible phase i.e. mullite may also be used for<br>
consolidation of HBN where mullite and HBN may   very well be connected by a boron<br>
containing glass. Mullite, at the same time, may provide a layer on the surface of the compacted<br>
mass thus protecting it from oxidation. However, during heat treatment in air, oxidation of BN<br>
and formation of mullite occurs simultaneously. If mullite formation is accelerated by taking<br>
recourse to active ingredients for the formation of mullite which is accomplished by using fine<br>
SiO2 and gel-alumina in the present invention, formation of mullite will be predominant and<br>
oxidation BN will be controlled.<br><br>
