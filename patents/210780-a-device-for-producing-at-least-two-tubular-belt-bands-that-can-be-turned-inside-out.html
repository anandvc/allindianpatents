Device for the production of at least two reversible<br>
tubular belt bands<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a device for the production of at least two reversible tubular belt bands according to the pre-characterizing clause of Claim 1.<br>
Prior art<br>
WO 98/51845 describes a tubular band and a device for producing it by means of a weaving machine* The weaving machine has a weaving reed/ the reed dents of which form a gap narrowing from the top downwards. The weaving reed is movable up and down, with the result that the warp threads come into regions of differing spread (density) , so that a tubular band of changing width can be produced. It is still necessary, for this purpose, for the fabric to be guided at its two fabric longitudinal edges, and preferably immediately after the beating-up of the weft thread, by temples - These temples either are arranged at the edge regions and are controllable in terms of their width action, with the result that band guidance in the intermediate region is insufficient. Or cylindrical temples are used, which are fitted with needles having the disadvantage that they may damage, for example distort, the fabric to be produced and may change the fabric density. Such a tubular band can be produced seamlessly in various variants. In one variant, it is proposed to produce the tubular band with a seam, even in multiple copies, as a broad fabric in a weaving machine and to cut it into individual tubular bands by means of a thermal cutting device. There are, however, considerable doubts as to whether a useful broad fabric can be produced by the weaving reed on account of the pronounced variation in<br><br>
density of the warp threads, since compression and decompression occur to an increased extent between adjacent tubular bands.<br>
Apart from the fact that the device and the production method are extremely complicated, the warp-thread density changes according to the spread by the weaving reed, so that there is a looser fabric structure in broader regions than in a narrower region. This results in a tubular band which, particularly in the broader region, has a relatively coarse structure and correspondingly also restricted stability. In particular, such a tubular fabric is not suitable as a belt band, nor as an inflatable car safety belt, since such belt bands have to absorb longitudinal forces, that is to say forces running in the holding direction. By the warp threads being arranged with changing density, they do not run parallel and straight, with the result that longitudinal forces cannot be accurately absorbed, but, instead, bring about a change in length and/or a deformation of the belt band. In addition, the hem of the tubular band, lying on the outside, is not only ugly, but may also cause damage and injury because of its hard edge,<br>
WO 99/40247 describes a woven belt band which is suitable as an inflatable belt band for car safety belts. It has the disadvantage that this fabric either must be woven as a circular fabric or has two weaving plies which are connected to one another at least on one side by means of a woven hem. The belt band has to be folded together, multi-ply, in a complicated way, in order not only to make it suitable as a belt band, but also to conceal the ugly and dangerous hem.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to specify an improved device for the production of at least two reversible<br><br>
tubular belt bands, which makes it possible in a simple way to produce the belt band efficiently.<br>
The object is achieved by means of the combination of the features of Claim 1. Since the belt band is first produced as a fabric band on a weaving machine with parallel reed dents and the shape of the cavity is determined solely by the design of the hem, this results, along with simple production, in a highly stable and load-bearing belt band, since the warp threads lie exactly parallel and are therefore not subjected to any variation in length and in position under load. The temple extending over the entire fabric width, with its smaller diameter in the tube region than in the hem region, ensures a uniform clamping of the fabric over the entire fabric width and a satisfactory low-distortion run of the fabric web for the satisfactory production of the fabric in spite of different thicknesses and densities of the fabric. Moreover, since multiple copies are now possible, that is to say at least the simultaneous production of two belt bands in the fabric web, production is particularly efficient.<br>
Since the belt band is reversible, the woven hem can be arranged to lie on the inside by the woven belt band being turned, and, as a result, not only does the woven belt band have a visually pleasing appearance, but it also has considerable advantages in terms of use. The edge of the belt band is rounded and therefore not only has an attractive appearance, but also makes comfortable and safe use possible. In particular, because of these positive properties, it is suitable as an inflatable car safety belt.<br>
The most diverse possible weaving machines, such as those with air nozzles or water nozzles, furthermore with gripper or projectile weft insertion, are suitable for production.<br><br>
The belt band is suitable for the most diverse possible intended uses, such as, for example, for air bags or water bags or air or water hoses. Furthermore, it is suitable as a carrying band or safety band for vehicles, and, in particular, as an inflatable car safety belt.<br>
Advantageous designs of the device are described in the dependent Claims 2 to 16-<br><br>

Embodiments of the invention<br>
Figures 1 to 3 show a first belt band 2 formed from an upper fabric ply 4 and a lower fabric ply 6 which are connected to one another via hems 8 and 10 located on both sides and which between them enclose a cavity 12. In the present example, the hems 8, 10 run parallel to one another and thus delimit the cavity 12 with a uniform width over the entire length. Figures 2 and 3 show the belt band after production in the unreversed state and Figure 1 shows the same belt band in the ready-to-use reversed state, that is to say after the belt band of Figure 2 has been reversed and the hems 8, 10 no longer lie on the outside, but on the inside.<br>
As may be gathered from Figure 3, the belt band is formed by means of warp threads 14 which are connected to one another by means of weft threads 16, The warp<br><br>
threads 14i of the cavity region 12 preferably have a greater thickness than the warp threads 142 of the hems 8, 10. All the warp threads run parallel to one another, the warp threads 142 of the hems 8, 10 having a greater density than the warp threads 141 of the fabric plies 4, 6 of the cavity 12- The thicker warp threads 141 of the fabric plies 4, 6 serve, in particular, for force transmission in the longitudinal direction of the belt band. To increase the safety, the fabric plies 4, 6 are connected to one another, at the point of transition to the hem 8, 10, by means of tie-off threads 18 which counteract an unintended loosening of the hem.<br>
The belt band 20 shown in Figures 4 to 6 corresponds essentially to the belt band of Figures 1 to 3, so that identical parts are given the same reference symbols. In contrast to the belt band 2 of Figures 1 to 3, the belt band 20 has lateral regions 22, in which, on the one hand, the belt band 20 and, on the other hand, the cavity 121 are widened. The warp threads, not illustrated in any more detail, are thinner in these lateral regions 22 than in the central region 24, the warp threads preferably having the same thickness as those of the hems 81 and lO1- The hems 81 and lO1 have tie-off threads 18 on the side facing the cavity 121. The fabric plies 41 and 61 are connected to one another at the point of transition into the lateral regions 22, likewise by means of tie-off threads 26, in order to make reversal easier. These tie-off threads 26, however, are designed as tearing threads which tear if the cavity 121 is inflated, as is the case, for example, when such a belt band is used as an inflatable car safety belt. Figures 5 and 6 show the belt band 20 after production in the unreversed state and Figure 4 shows the same belt band in the reversed state.<br><br>
The belt bands 2 and 20 may be provided on the inside or on the outside with a coating preventing or limiting a passage of fluid.<br>
Figures 7 to 9 show a diagrammatic illustration of a weaving machine for producing the belt bands 2 and 20. Warp threads 14 are fed via a warp beam 30 to a shedding device 32 containing a Jacquard device 34 which can be controlled according to the pattern by a computer-control electronic control device 36• The Jacquard device 34 contains healds 38 which control the individual warp threads 14 via eyes 40. Weft threads 42 are inserted via a weft insertion device, not illustrated in more detail, into the shed 44 opened by the shedding device 32 and are beaten up at the cloth edge 4 8 by means of a weaving reed 46. The weaving reed 4 6 contains reed dents 50 which are arranged in parallel and which ensure a parallel guidance of the warp threads 14. The fabric web produced in this way runs through a temple 52, in order to maintain the fabric web 54 of the desired width. A fabric take-up device 56 ensures the necessary longitudinal tension of the fabric web on the weaving machine and feeds the fabric web to a receiving container, not illustrated in any more detail, or to a corresponding cloth beam. The fabric take-up device 56 is assigned a thermosetting device 58, in order to make the fabric web produced stress-free before the fabric leaves the fabric take-up device. How hollow fabrics can be produced by means of such a weaving machine is state of the art and is described, for example, in Hans Walter Kipp, Bandwebtechnik [Ribbon weaving technology], JTM-Stiftung Frick 1988, pages 180 ff.<br>
Between the temple 52 and the fabric take-up device 56, the weaving machine contains a thermal cutting device 60 having as many cutting heads 62 as there are cuts to be carried out along the fabric web 54. For straight cuts, the cutting heads can be arranged fixedly on a<br><br>
carrier 64. If, however, the cutting heads 62 are to execute figuring cuts, they are movable transversely to the running direction of the fabric web, for example along the carrier 64, this movability being capable of being controlled according to the pattern by means of the control device 36, as indicated by the control line 66.<br>
As may be gathered from Figures 8 and 9, the temple 52 is profiled according to the belt bands to be produced. Thus, a clamping bar 65 of the temple 52, said clamping bar being arranged in a recess 63, has, in the regions assigned to the cavities 12, recesses 67 which reduce the pressure and, instead, increase the pressure in the regions of the hems 8, 10, in order to obtain an essentially uniform pressure over the entire width and make it possible to have a satisfactory low-distortion run of the fabric web 54. For the same purpose, a pressure roller 68 of the fabric take-up device 56 is also profiled and has recesses 69 on the portions assigned to the cavities 12.<br>
Figure 10 shows a diagrammatic illustration of the production of two belt bands 2 from a fabric web 541, in a diagrammatic illustration. Since the belt band 2 has a central region 24 and hems 8, 10 of uniform width, the cutting heads 62 of the thermal cutting device 60 can be set fixedly at a uniform spacing. The cutting heads 62 in this case cut the hem region 70 laterally of the belt bands 2 in parallel cuts 71, so that the hems 8 and 10 are obtained.<br>
Figure 11 shovjs, in a similar way to Figure 10, , the production of belt bands 20 with cavities 12i of changing width according to Figure 5 from a fabric web 542/ adjacent belt bands 20i being arranged parallel next to one another. Since the fabric web are [sic] separated by means of parallel cuts 71, the cutting<br><br>
heads 62, set fixedly to corresponding spacings, are fastened to a carrier 64.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 show the production of belt bands 2O2 of a fabric web 543 by means of a weaving machine of Figures 7 to 9, in this case, however, the adjacent belt bands being arranged with their lateral regions 22 offset to one another, in order to allow more efficient low-waste manufacture. In this case, these belt bands 2O2 can be cut out in two ways, specifically,, according to Figure 12, in each case with only one cutting head per hem region, which cuts the hem region 70i by means of a single cut 711 between the belt bands 2O2 approximately to half the width and, at most, supplies hems 81, lO1 of different widths. In the other variant according to Figure 13, there are, per hem region 7O2, two cutting heads which make it possible to have two cuts 712 713 and hems 82, 102 of uniform width.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 12, the thermal cutting device 6O1 has two cutting units 72, 74 which contain for each cutting pattern a series of cutting heads 621, 622 which are movable synchronously and simultaneously with one another according to the contour of the hem 81, 101 to be produced. For this purpose, the cutting heads of a cutting unit 72, 74 are in each case fastened to a common carrier 76, 78 which in each case is movable according to the pattern by an actuator 80, 82 transversely to the running direction of the fabric web 543, that is to say transversely to the warp threads- For this purpose, the actuators 80, 82 in each case receive their control pulses from the control device 36  by means of control lines 661-<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 13, a thermal cutting device 6O2 is provided, which for each hem region has two cutting heads 623, 624 which are in each case movable individually back and forth according to the pattern, so that belt bands 2O2 with hems 82 102 of<br><br>
uniform width can be cut out. The cutting heads are arranged movably on stationary carriers 84, 86 and each have, for example, a stepping motor, not illustrated in any more detail, which can be controlled by the control device 36 via a control line 663 and which moves the cutting head on the carrier according to the pattern via a driving wheel 88 acting on the carrier.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiments, the cutting devices are arranged directly on the weaving machine. It is perfectly possible, however, initially to produce only the fabric webs on the weaving machine and to carry out the cutting into belt bands on a cutting device separate from the weaving machine.<br><br>
