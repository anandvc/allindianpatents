PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CARBAPENEM COMPOUND FOR ORAL<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an efficient and<br>
extremely useful process for producing a 1b-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration.<br>
Background Art<br>
A lP-methylcarbapenem compound is one of the<br>
antibacterial agents attracting the most attention because<br>
it shows an excellent antibacterial effect on a wide variety<br>
of pathogenic organisms and is excellent in stability in vivo.<br>
Accordingly, various research and development have been made<br>
energetically in recent years attempting to produce the drugs<br>
for oral administration. Processes for producing a<br>
lP-methylcarbapenem compound for oral administration, which<br>
are generally used at present, include the following processes.<br>
For example, there is described a process in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 8-53453 and J.<br>
Antibiot., p. 429-439, 1997, which comprises the steps of<br>
reacting a compound represented by formula (6):<br>
with each of various thiol compounds (R-SH) to synthesize a<br>
compound represented by formula (7):<br>
wherein R denotes a thiol residue; eliminating a p-nitrobenzyl<br>
group, a protective group, from the compound represented by<br>
formula (7) , for example, by hydrogenolysis or reduction by<br>
a zinc powder to convert it to a compound represented by formula<br>
(8):<br>
wherein R denotes a thiol residue; and subjecting the<br>
carboxylic moiety of the resulting compound (8) to<br>
pivaloyloxymethylation to produce a compound represented by<br>
formula (9):<br>
wherein R denotes a thiol residue, and But denotes a tert-butyl<br>
group.<br>
As the compounds represented by formula (9) , for example,<br>
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos.<br>
8-53453 and 10-19507 6 is described a compound represented by<br>
formula (10):<br>
; in J. Antibiot., P. 429-439, 1997 and Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 10-130270 is described a<br>
compound represented by formula (11):<br>
; and in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 10-152491 is described a compound represented by formula<br>
(12) :<br>
All of these compounds are synthesized by the above-described<br>
process.<br>
However, when 1b-methylcarbapenem compound for oral<br>
administration is produced by these production processes, it<br>
is necessary to exchange the protecting group of carboxylic<br>
acid through multistep reactions, which is ineffective; and<br>
relatively expensive thiol compounds, each of which is related<br>
to a thiol residue in a final product, are used in the initial<br>
stage of synthesis, which is disadvantageous in terms of<br>
production cost. These have been regarded as problems in the<br>
above production processes.<br>
Furthermore, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
PublicationNos. 8-59663 and2000-344774 is describedaprocess<br>
for producing a compound represented by formula (15):<br>
wherein R5 denotes a hydroxy-protecting group; R6 denotes a<br>
thiol residue contained in a 1b-methylcarbapenem compound,<br>
a product; and R7 denotes an organic group,<br>
by the steps of synthesizing a compound represented by<br>
formula (14):<br>
wherein R5, R6 and R7 each denote the same as described above;<br>
and R8, R9 and Ro each denote a lower alkoxy group having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms, or any one of R8, R9 and Ro denotes an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and remaining two each denote<br>
a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
from a compound represented by formula (13):<br>
wherein R5, R6 and R7 each denote the same as described above,<br>
and<br>
cyclizing the compound represented by formula (14).<br>
However, in this production process also, relatively<br>
expensive thiol compounds, each of which is related to a thiol<br>
residue in a final product, are used in the initial stage of<br>
synthesis in the same manner as described above. Therefore,<br>
the process is also disadvantageous in terms of production<br>
cost, which has been regarded as a problem.<br>
Furthermore, in J. Org. Chem., vol. 61, P. 7889-7894,<br>
1996 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 5-279367 is described a compound represented by formula<br>
(16):<br>
wherein Me denotes a methyl group; and But denotes the same<br>
as described above. It may be considered that the compound<br>
is converted to a lP-methylcarbapenem compound by allowing<br>
it to react with any of various thiol compounds and by<br>
deprotection of a hydroxy group. However, since a<br>
tert-butyldimethylsilyl group is used as the<br>
hydroxy-protecting group in the above compound (16), it is<br>
necessary to use a reagent that influences other functional<br>
groups in order to perform deprotection at the hydroxylic<br>
moiety, as illustrated in Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis (J Wiley &amp; Sons, New York), P. 44-46, 1981. This<br>
is a problem in terms of yields or the like. The present<br>
inventors have made various studies on the method of<br>
deprotection, and have found that it is difficult to perform<br>
deprotection easily and efficiently.<br>
Under the circumstances as described above, the<br>
development of a efficient process for producing a<br>
lP-methylcarbapenem compound for oral administration,<br>
wherein the process is advantageous in terms of production<br>
cost, has been desired.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of the above circumstances, the present inventors<br>
have extensively studied on the development of a production<br>
process in which a thiol compound can be introduced by one<br>
step at the final stage of the synthesis of a<br>
1b-methylcarbapenem compound for oral administration. As a<br>
result of the extensive study, the present invention has been<br>
accomplished.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a process<br>
for producing a compound represented by general formula (2) :<br>
wherein R2 denotes an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms; R3 denotes<br>
an organic group; and R4 denotes a hydrogen atom, a<br>
trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group,<br>
characterized by reacting a compound represented by<br>
general formula (1):<br>
wherein R1 denotes a hydrogen atom, a trimethylsilyl group<br>
or a triethylsilyl group; R2 denotes the same as described<br>
above,<br>
with a thiol compound represented by general formula (3) :<br>
R3-SH (3)<br>
wherein R3 denotes the same as described above,<br>
in the presence of a base and optionally eliminating the<br>
protective group R1.<br>
Detailed Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail<br>
below.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing<br>
a compound represented by general formula (2):<br>
, characterized by reacting a compound represented by general<br>
formula (1):<br>
with a thiol compound represented by general formula (3):<br>
R3-SH (3)<br>
in the presence of a base and optionally eliminating the<br>
protective group R1.<br>
Substituents in each compound will first be described.<br>
The substituent R1 denotes a hydrogen atom, a trimethylsilyl<br>
group or a triethylsilyl group. When the substituent R1 is<br>
a hydrogen atom, there is obtained a compound (2) in which<br>
the substituent R4 is a hydrogen atom. On the other hand,<br>
from the compound (1) in which the substituent R1 is a<br>
trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group, there is<br>
produced a compound (2) in which the substituent R4 is a<br>
trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group. In this case,<br>
the compound (2) having the substituent R4 which is obtained<br>
as a product is different from the conventionally known<br>
compound represented by (16) as described above in that it<br>
can easily deprotect the hydroxy group to obtain the compound<br>
(2) having a hydrogen atom as the substituent R4. The<br>
 substituent R1 is selected such that, when the compound (2)<br>
obtained as a product is subjected to deprotection reaction,<br>
it can be eliminated under a mild condition with minimum<br>
decomposition of other functional group moieties in the<br>
compound to the extent possible.] In order to facilitate the<br>
deprotection, when the substituent R1 is a hydroxy-protecting<br>
group, it needs to be a trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl<br>
group, preferably a trimethylsilyl group.<br>
The substituent R2 denotes an alkyl group having 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, which may be contained in the alkanoyloxymethyl group<br>
portion of a carboxylate residue in a compound that may finally<br>
be developed as a lp-methylcarbapenem compound for oral<br>
administration.<br>
Examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl,<br>
iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-octyl, n-decanyl and the<br>
like.<br>
The cycloalkyl group having carbon atoms of 3 to 10 may<br>
have a substituent, which includes an alkyl group having carbon<br>
atoms of 1 to 4 such as methyl and ethyl, and the like. Examples<br>
of the cycloalkyl group having carbon atoms of 3 to 10 include<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl, 1-methylcyclohexyl,<br>
4-methylcyclohexyl and the like.<br>
As the substituent R2, a tert-butyl group, which is often<br>
used in the development of a carbapenem compound for oral<br>
administration, is most preferred among others.<br>
The substituent R3 denotes an organic group, which may<br>
preferably be contained in the thiol residue in a compound<br>
that may finally be developed as a lfi-methylcarbapenem compound<br>
for oral administration. More preferably, examples of the<br>
thiol residue of a thiol compound represented by general<br>
formula (3):<br>
R3-SH (3)<br>
(wherein R3 denotes an organic group) include the thiol residue<br>
of a compound which is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 8-53453, represented by formula<br>
(4) :<br>
; the thiol residue of a compound which is described in J.<br>
Antibiot., P. 429-439, 1997, represented by formula (5):<br>
; and the thiol residue of a compound which is described in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<br>
10-152491, represented by formula (19):<br>
The substituent R3 is preferably the thiol residue of<br>
a compound represented by formula (4) or the thiol residue<br>
of a compound represented by formula (5).<br>
The substituent R4 denotes a hydrogen atom, a<br>
trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group. As described<br>
above, when the substituent R4 is a trimethylsilyl group or<br>
a triethylsilyl group, a l(3-methylcarbapenem compound for oral<br>
administration can be easily obtained by eliminating it as<br>
necessary.<br>
A production process of the present invention will now<br>
be described.<br>
The compound represented by formula (1), which is the<br>
starting raw material to be used in the present invention,<br>
can be derived from a compound represented by formula (17) :<br>
wherein R" denotes an aryl group or a heteroaryl group, which<br>
may have a substituent, examples of which are described in<br>
detail as reference examples 1 to 4. The compound represented<br>
by formula (17) can be easily prepared according to the<br>
description in Chem. Pharm. Bull., vol. 42, P. 1381-1387, 1994.<br>
The compound (1) is reacted with the thiol compound<br>
represented by formula (3) in the presence of a base to obtain<br>
a lP-methylcarbapenem compound represented by formula (2).<br>
The reaction is performed in an inert solvent which does<br>
not decompose the compound (1) . Examples of the inert solvent<br>
include, but not limited to, ether solvents such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and diethyl ether; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene andxylene; amide<br>
solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide; dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile,<br>
acetone, methylene chloride and mixed solvents thereof, and<br>
the like. Most preferred are N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide and acetonitrile, in terms of reaction<br>
rate.<br>
The molar amount of the thiol compound (3) to be used<br>
in the reaction needs to be 1.0 time or more as compared to<br>
that of the compound (1), preferably from 1.1 to 3.0 times.<br>
The thiol compound (3) may form a salt such as a hydrochloride.<br>
Furthermore, the base to be usedmay include organic amines,<br>
alkalimetal salts, alkali metal alkoxides, alkalimetal amides,<br>
alkali metal hydrides and the like.<br>
Examples of the organic amines include triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine,<br>
1, 8-diazabicyclo[ 5.4.0] -undec-7-ene (DBU) ,<br>
l,5-diazabicyclo[ 4.3. 0]-non-5-ene (DBN) , and<br>
l,4-diazabicyclo[ 2.2.2] octane (DABCO) . When organic amines<br>
are used, the molar amount of the same to be used needs to<br>
be 1.0 time or more as compared to that of the compound (1),<br>
preferably from 1.1 to 3.0 times.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal salts include alkali metal<br>
carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and<br>
cesium carbonate; alkali metal bicarbonates such as sodium<br>
bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate; and the like. When<br>
the alkali metal carbonates are used, the molar amount of the<br>
same to be used needs to be 0.5 time or more as compared to<br>
that of the compound (1), preferably from 1.1 to 2.0 times.<br>
When the alkali metal bicarbonates are used, the molar amount<br>
of the same to be used needs to be 1.0 time or more as compared<br>
to that of the compound (1) , preferably from 1.1 to 2.0 times.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal alkoxides include potassium<br>
tert-butoxide, sodium tert-butoxide and the like. When the<br>
alkali metal alkoxides are used, the molar amount of the same<br>
to be used needs to be 1.0 time or more as compared to that<br>
of the compound (1), preferably 1.1 to 2.0 times.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal amides include lithium<br>
bis (trimethylsilyl) amide, sodium bis (trimethylsilyl) amide,<br>
potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and the like. When the<br>
alkali metal amides are used, the molar amount of the same<br>
to be used needs to be 1.0 time or more as compared to that<br>
of the compound (1), preferably 1.1 to 2.0 times.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal hydrides include sodium<br>
hydride, potassiumhydride and the like. When the alkali metal<br>
hydrides are used, the molar amount of the same to be used<br>
needs to be 1. 0 time or more as compared to that of the compound<br>
(1), preferably 1.1 to 2.0 times.<br>
The above reaction is performed typically in the range<br>
of -78°C to 60°C, preferably in the range of -40°C to 40°C in<br>
order to inhibit decomposition of the reactants and products.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction time is typically in the range<br>
of 5 minutes to 40 hours, preferably in the range of one hour<br>
to 30 hours from the above reason.<br>
Naturally, the progress of the reaction with time can<br>
be obtained by analytic means such as thin layer chromatography<br>
(TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The target compound (2) can be isolated from the mixture<br>
after the reaction through operations such as pH-adjustment,<br>
extraction, liquid separation, washing, concentration,<br>
purification and the like, which are frequently used in typical<br>
organic reactions.<br>
When the substituent R1 of the compound (1) is a hydrogen<br>
atom, the compound (2) having a hydrogen atom as the substituent<br>
R4 can be obtained in the above reaction. Thus, a<br>
1b-methylcarbapenem compound for oral administration can be<br>
directly obtained.<br>
On the other hand, when the substituent R1 is a<br>
trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group, the resulting<br>
compound (2) has a trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl<br>
group as the substituent R4, respectively. The above<br>
 hydroxy-protecting group (a trimethylsilyl group or a<br>
 triethylsilyl group) as the substituent R1 is selected as a<br>
substituent which can be easily eliminated. Accordingly,<br>
when pH of the mixture after the reaction is adjusted in the<br>
operation such as extraction, washing or the like, the<br>
deprotection of the hydroxylic moiety can be performed at the<br>
same time as the operation by creating an acidic condition<br>
in the mixture. Thus, the compound (2) having a trimethylsilyl<br>
group or a triethylsilyl group as the substituent R4 can be<br>
easily converted to the compound (2) having a hydrogen atom<br>
as the substituent R4, thereby obtaining a 1b-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration.<br>
The acidic condition to be used in the above operation<br>
is not particularly limited as long as the pH is 7 or less,<br>
and the pH is preferably in the range of 2 to 6. In this pH<br>
range, the hydroxy-protecting group can be eliminated<br>
extremely easily. In order to achieve the above acidic<br>
condition, for example, an aqueous citric acid solution,<br>
hydrochloric acid or the like can be added to the extract or<br>
the like.<br>
Furthermore, when the substituent R4 is a trimethylsilyl<br>
group or a triethylsilyl group, the compound (2) may be once<br>
isolated from the reaction mixture to eliminate it separately.<br>
In addition to the above-described method, typical conditions<br>
for eliminating silyl protecting groups, as described, for<br>
example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (J Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, New York), pp. 39-50, 1981, can be adopted as the<br>
deprotection method in this case.<br>
A 1b-methylcarbapenem compound represented by formula<br>
(2) can be synthesized efficiently and easily in short steps<br>
from a compound represented by formula (1) and a thiol compound<br>
represented by formula (3) according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a preferable process as a<br>
process in which a thiol compound represented by formula (4)<br>
or (5) is particularly used as the thiol compound represented<br>
by formula (3) to synthesize a lP-methylcarbapenem compound<br>
for oral administration represented by formula (10):<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in more detail<br>
below with reference to examples and reference examples, but<br>
is not particularly limited at all to these descriptions. The<br>
meaning of the abbreviations used in the following examples<br>
and reference examples is as follows:<br>
Me: methyl group<br>
But: tert-butyl group<br>
TMS: trimethylsilyl group<br>
TES: triethylsilyl group<br>
Reference Example 1: Production of<br>
(3S,4S)-4-[ (1R) -l-(p-chlorophenylthiocarbonyl) ethyl] -3-[ (<br>
1R)-1-hydroxyethyl] -1-pivaloyloxymethyloxycarbonylmethyl-<br>
2-azetidinone<br>
In 18 ml of dimethylformamide, was dissolved 8 .18 g (22 . 0<br>
mmol) of<br>
(3S,4S)-l-carboxymethyl-4-[ (1R)-1-(p-chlorophenylthiocarb<br>
onyl) ethyl] -3-[ (1R) -1-hydroxyethyl] -2-azetidinone at room<br>
temperature. To the resulting solution, were successively<br>
added 5.5 ml (40.0 mmol) of pivaloyloxymethyl chloride and<br>
5.75 g (40.3 mmol) of sodium iodide, and was added dropwise<br>
4.2 ml (25.3 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine, followed by<br>
stirring the mixture for 20 hours at the same temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was diluted with 120 ml of toluene. The<br>
toluene solution was washed with 2.5% aqueous sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution and water, each several times. The<br>
resulting toluene solution was dried over sodium sulfate, and<br>
then the solvent was removed by evaporation. The resulting<br>
oily residue was dissolved in 60 ml of toluene at room<br>
temperature. To the resulting solution was added 120 ml of<br>
hexane, precipitating a crystal, which was filtered and washed<br>
to obtain 9. 46 g of a white crystal of the title compound (yield:<br>

Reference Example 1. To the resulting solution, was added<br>
0.88 mL (6.4 mmol) of triethylamine and was dropwise added<br>
0.78 mL (6.2 mmol) of trimethylsilyl chloride at room<br>
temperature, followed by stirring the mixture for 15 hours<br>
at the same temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted<br>
with 5 ml of toluene. The toluene solution was washed with<br>
water several times. The resulting toluene solution was dried<br>
over sodium sulfate, and then the solvent was removed by<br>
evaporation.<br>
To 2.63 g of the resulting oily residue, was added 22.5<br>
.ml of tetrahydrofuran to dissolve the oily residue. The<br>
solution was cooled to -70°C, andO.956g (8.5mmol) ofpotassium<br>
