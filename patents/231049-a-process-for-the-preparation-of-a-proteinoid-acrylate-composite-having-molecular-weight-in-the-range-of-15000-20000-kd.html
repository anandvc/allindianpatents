				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a proteinoid-acrylate composite having molecular weight in the range of 15000-20000 KD. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a proteinoid-acrylate composite for application as filler-cum-syntan in leather processing industry. The syntan of the present invention has<br>
potential  application  in  post tanning  wet  processing  section  of leather<br>
processing industry to get filling effect, grain tightness and softness in the<br>
processed leather. The composite may also be used as filler in cardboard<br>
industry.<br>
One of the important operations, leathers are subjected to during the post<br>
tanning wet operations is retanning, which has a major role to play in<br>
connection with tightness, fullness and softness of the final leather. Different<br>
syntans   are   conventionally   used   for  this   purpose   depending   on   the<br>
requirement of properties and end uses of the final leather.<br>
Retanning syntans have usually been of non-proteinous nature. They may in<br>
general be classified into two broad categories - phenolic syntan and resin<br>
syntan.<br>
Phenolic    syntans    are    essentially    phenol/    cresol/napthol/formaldehyde<br>
containing acid derivatives, which can partially or completely replace vegetable<br>
tanning materials for imparting tanning effect. Hence, they are also known as<br>
replacement syntans. The phenolic syntans exhibit better filling effect in leather<br>
and also result in better nap in suede leather. The main limitation of these<br><br>
syntans lies in poor degradability as well as poor exhaustion in the range of 50-60% during dyeing, thereby adding to the effluent problem by way of increasing total dissolved solids of the waste water.<br>
Resin syntans are essentially the sodium or ammonium salts of different resins, other than those, of phenol formaldehyde types. Resins of urea, dicyanamide, melamine etc., with formaldehyde or resins of acrylic and methacrylic acids, di-isocyanates, dialdehyde have generally been of much use. These syntans not only posses tanning properties, but also exhibit selective filling effect to ensure that the looseness of the leathers is removed. Thus these syntans provide uniformity, softness and grain tightness to the leather. As reported by Ludvik, (United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Report, 1,24,1996), the limitation associated with these syntans of poor exhaustion to the tune of maximum 60% during dyeing of leather, thereby adding to the effluent problem. Another major limitation associated with the resin syntans is that they are not stable at a temperature of more than 80°C, thereby rendering them unsuitable for producing leathers to be glaze finished.<br>
The above limitations of the conventional resin syntans have prompted the researchers to look for better option in the realm of leather syntan. Ramamurthy et al (Journal of Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 73,168,1989) provided a process for preparing keratin hydrolysate for using as protein based syntan in leather processing, whereby the keratinous protein is hydrolysed by using acid or alkali. Conventionally, the acid hydrolysis of protein is carried out<br><br>
at a pH in the range of 1-2, while alkali hydrolysis is done at a pH in the range<br>
of 10-12. While the keratin hydrolysate, as prepared above, is effective in<br>
improving the exhaustibility of dye or chrome to the tune of 85-90%, the major<br>
limitation associated therewith is the lack of filling effect in the final leather,<br>
thereby exhibiting no improvement on grain tightness.<br>
Another limitation associated with the keratin hydrolysate is that it can be stored<br>
for a maximum period of 6 months only because of its proteinous nature, which<br>
results in its decaying tendency.<br>
No prior art is available on any protein-resin combination product.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a novel proteinoid-acrylate composite having molecular weight<br>
in the range of 15000-20000 KD, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a composite having thermo-tolerance more than 150°C.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of a composite, which can be stored for a period of minimum 1year.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
economical use- of the abundantly available proteinous wastes to prepare<br>
proteinoid-acrylate composite.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing<br>
a composite, which on being used in leather processing, imparts grain tightness<br><br>
in leather and ensures better nap in suede leather, exhibiting at the same time<br>
an exhaustability of more than 98% in dye bath.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a<br>
proteinoid-acrylate composite having molecular weight in the range of<br>
15000-20000 KD, which comprises	<br>
i.   aqueous washing of a proteinous material  such as herein describeddby known method followed by<br><br>
conventional acid or alkali hydrolysis for a period of minimum 30 minutes<br>
and subsequent sterilisation of the resulting hydrolysate by known method, ii.   separating the sterilised protein hydrolysate, as formed in step (i) by known<br>
method and adjusting the pH of the resulting solution in the range of 4.5 - 6<br>
by conventional method, iii. treating the resulting solution with 10-30% v/v, of an acrylic polymer of<br>
molecular weight in the range of 12000-15000 KD for a period of minimum<br>
30 minutes, followed by optional addition of 0.01-0.1% w/v antimicrobial<br>
agent,'such as herein described	to get the proteinoid-acrylate composite.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the source of proteinous material<br>
used may be  hide, skin, fleshing, buffing dust, shaving dust, leather<br>
trimmings, animal hair.<br>
In  another embodiment of the present invention, the  known  method  of<br>
sterilisation   used   may   be  autoclaving,   Ultraviolet   radiation,<br>
refrigeration.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the known method of<br>
separation used may be  filtration, centrifuging, gravity separation.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the acrylate polymer used<br>
may be such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the antimicrobial agent<br>
used may be such as parachloro meta cresol, ortho phenyl phenol, thio cyano<br>
thio methyl thio benzo thiozole, either individually or in combination.<br>
The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br>
A proteinous source is washed well in aqueous medium to remove the adhering<br>
extraneous materials and the washed stock is subjected to either acid or alkali<br>
hydrolysis by conventional method for a period of minimum 30 minutes. While<br>
acid hydrolysis is carried out at a pH in the range of 1-2, alkali hydrolysis is<br>
carried out at a pH in the range of 10-12.<br>
The resulting protein hydrolysate is sterilised by known method and the<br>
sterilised solution is subjected to separation by known method to get the pure<br>
protein hydrolysate solution.<br>
pH of the pure protein hydrolysate solution, as obtained above,  is adjusted in<br>
the range of 4.5-6 by conventional method and the resulting solution is treated<br>
with 10-30% v/v, of an acrylic polymer of molecular weight in the range of<br>
12000-15000 KD, for a period of minimum 30 minutes under stirring condition<br>
to get the proteinoid-acrylate composite. 0.01-0.1% v/v, of antimicrobial agent is<br>
then added, as an optional step, to the resulting mass for storage.<br><br>
The novelty and non-obviousness of the present invention lies in copolymerising a protein hydrolysate with acrylic resin to prepare a substrate exhibiting the desirable characteristics, which are otherwise difficult to be achieved using either protein based syntan or acrylic syntan individually, thereby suggesting at the same time an economical option for utilizing the proteinous wastes of different industries including leather industry in useful way. The following examples are given by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
1 Kg of hide fleshing, collected from the lime yard of a tannery, was washed thoroughly with plain water to remove all the extraneous matters. The washed stock was then taken in a round bottomed flask and 3 litres of water was added to it. 44 gms of solid NaOH pellets were then added slowly to the flask with continuous stirring, which was continued for another 30 min. At this stage, pH of the solution inside the flask was noted to be 10 and the mouth of the flask was plugged with non-absorbent cotton.<br>
The flask was then autoclaved at a pressure of 1 Kg psi. After a period of three hours the flask was taken out of the autoclave and was allowed to cool down to a temperature of 25°C. The flask was then unplugged and the solution inside was filtered using filter paper. The solution was collected in a beaker and pH of the solution was found to be 11 which was brought down to 5.5 by adding 100 ml of dilute HCI.<br><br>
200 ml of methyl acrylate having molecular weight of 12000 KD was added to the beaker with continuous stirring. After a period of 15 minutes, 0.5 gm of para chloro meta cresol with 0.5 gm of ortho-phenyl phenol were added to the beaker under stirring condition and the resulting solution of the proteinoid-acrylate composite was stored in a plastic container.<br>
