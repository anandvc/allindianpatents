GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present invention is relates to "A NOVEL BOTTLE DRIPPER FOR DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM". The invention provides a portable and reusable irrigation device for dispensing irrigation liquid from a bottle to a target plant holder substrate area.<br>
Water is a vital resource available on earth, but utilizable water resources are not available in enough quantity at everywhere to irrigate the cultivable area, hence efforts are needed to maximize the use of water. A major quantity of water is utilized for irrigation in agriculture. Farmers prefer flood irrigation and the more recently introduced sprinkler and drip irrigation methods. Water is in constant demand for domestic use, animal culture, industries and agriculture. However, given the limited resources, less than one per cent water is available for the above purpose and hence it is treated as gold. Its judicious use is strongly recommended in all sectors, including crop irrigation. This, along with greater industrialization will mean that less water will be available for use in agriculture. Hence, it is necessary that methods like drip irrigation are adopted on a large scale for various crops.<br>
Drip irrigation is now widely used in water irrigation systems. Drip irrigation is also known as Trickle irrigation, which is micro irrigation. Such advance methods could be introduced for all type of crops, depending on the soil, slope, water sources, farmers' capacity, crop spacing etc. Wherein a water supply conduit is connected to a plurality of dripper tubes each provided with a plurality of emitter opening along its length tor discnaiyiny walei dl^~slow rate from each opening. Such dripper attached with laterals are thus capatrie oTsupplying water directly to the region of the plants at a very slow<br><br><br>
rate, thereby saving water and frequently also increasing yields. At present a method of drip or trickle irrigation is the most efficient method of irrigation of the crops. In small scale agricultural sectors, large and complex apparatus is unnecessary used which performs either automatically or manually. Automatic apparatus consists of spray units that are fixed or displaceable and are automatically operated at fixed times. Said units may be mechanical sprayers and may direct sprays in changing directions to cover broad areas of relevant growth, or may comprise rigid or flexible conduits having openings therein the allow irrigation water to issue in drops or thin streams. Hand operated apparatus generally consist of flexible pipes which deliver water streams or sprays from their end orifices and may be carried and directed by users to project said water streams or sprays as desired. Automatic apparatus is expensive and water consuming and is not adapted individually to irrigate plants, as it is always conceived to irrigate broad areas of vegetable growth. Hand operated apparatus may be inexpensive, but is awkward to use and is wasteful and inefficient in the irrigation of individual plants, as it generates streams or broad sprays of water which always spread the water over large areas. Recently, drip irrigation has been employed in small scale agricultural applications in order to increase water efficiency. Water is applied only to those areas where it is needed, that is, it is dripped in the pit of the soil above a root zone, and therefore only a relatively small amount is wasted. Drip irrigation depends on a pump and other ancillary equipment to force water through perforated pipes running above ground, at rates of 1-10 liters per hour per emitter. Even though the technology is simple, drip irrigation  requires careful  maintenance of equipment since the<br><br><br>
drippers can become easily clogged, which reduces the discharge and also removal of fitter due to clogging of the fitter.<br>
To over come the conventional dripper difficulties the present invention A NOVEL BOTTLE DRIPPER FOR DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM is invented, the device is fully portable, reusable and systems which can be moved from one field to another. A Novel Bottle dripper device is used in agriculture for emergency response; utilization of waste water bottles, dust control, various discharge can be designed and controlled for various types of crops and pollution control. Water is applied to the crop area near the root zone so, it saves the use of water up to 20 to 70% and enhances the plant growth and increases the yield. Bottle drip irrigation system is saving in labor work and also controls the growth weeds and others parasites i.e. Increases the fertilizer efficacy, Flexibilities in operation is achieved,. Suitable for undulating and poor soils, Possibilities of using saline water,. Quantity improvement, Water is conveyed through a system of flexible pipelines, operating low pressure and is applied to the plants through drip nozzles. This technique is also known as 'feeding bottle' technique where by the soil is maintained in the most optimum range. Liquid chemical additives, such as fertilizers, weed killers and pesticides, are generally added to the water which is pumped to the drippers of a drip irrigation system or different quantity of fertilizers can be added for different types of crops in bottle dripper.so that a given soil area or substrate may support increased plant growth. In order to preserve its structural integrity, a pump for delivering a corrosive fertilizer solution, for example, to a drip irrigation system, needs to be made from expensive non-corrosive material such as stainless steel. Economic<br><br><br>
considerations therefore preclude, or restrict, the use of portable and reusable irrigation device which are based on a drip irrigation system.<br>
Some prior art irrigation devices employ an inverted reservoir to deliver irrigation liquid to a given plant growth substrate. Although such an irrigation device is economical, the delivery rate of irrigation liquid is not controllable, and therefore an inordinate amount of liquid is improperly utilized which effect the root zone due to over watering. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a portable and reusable irrigation device which delivers a controllable rate of irrigation liquid for a predetermined duration.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a portable irrigation device which operates intermittently at desired times and which may be started and stopped instantaneously as desired.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a portable irrigation device which may deliver a fertilizer solution without compromising its structural integrity without disturbing pumping system and venturi. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a portable irrigation device which may direct irrigation liquid to any desired targeted area. It is yet an additional object of the present invention to provide a portable irrigation device which is easy to use. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an inexpensive bottle dripper for drip irrigation system. It will be understood that a device having such features permits a most efficient irrigation system with maximum saving of water. Since<br><br><br>
irrigation liquid is delivered at desired times and can be directed precisely to a desired target.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear as the description proceeds.<br>
The present invention is fully describe by the following description in which reference is made to the drawings as follow.<br>
Fig. 1   side elevation view of the bottle dripper<br>
Fig.2  top elevation view of the bottle dripper<br>
Fig.3 side elevation view of the bottle dripper irrigation device plant<br>
The side elevation view of the bottle dripper irrigation device is represented in Fig.1 First of all bottle (3) is cut form the bottom side of the bottle. Then the light weight ball (4) is inserted into the bottle as shown in Fig.1. Funnel (2) is fitted at the bottom portion of the bottle (3) where the bottle is cut in such a way that outlet portion is on upward side wherein T-bend (1) is fixed with the outlet portion of funnel in such a way that it becomes leak proof and both ends of the T-bend (1) is remains open form the both side. Referring Fig.3 the distribution pipe (9) is fixed with one open end of T-bend and other end of the distribution pipe is fixed into the other end of other T-bend. Distribution pipe (9) is connected with water supply, where valve is provided for open or close option. Discharge hole is done at the outlet of bottle (3) or in the bottle cap (6) as per requirement of the discharge of water requirement. The prepared dripper bottle is tied with tree (8) with the help of wire (10) as shown in Fig.3. Water is coming into the bottle form the distribution pipe (9), when the<br><br><br>
bottle is fully filled with water at that time the light Weight floating ball is moving towards funnel(2) outlet and floating ball will fit into the funnel hole and block the water coming inside the bottle form the hole of funnel(2), and water flows towards another dripper. At the same time when water emits from the outlet of the bottle or in the bottle cap as designed discharged of water requirement, the water level decreases and floating ball moves downward and the hole of the funnel is open for a water to enter again into the bottle (3). Same procedure is repeated again and again.<br><br><br>
