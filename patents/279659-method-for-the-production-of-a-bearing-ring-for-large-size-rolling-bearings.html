METHOD    FOR   THE    PRODUCTION    OF   A   BEARING    RING   FOR<br>
LARGE-SIZE ROLLING BEARINGS<br>
Description:<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a bearing ring for large-size rolling<br>
bearings comprised of at least one race with a hardened peripheral layer in which the<br>
peripheral layer that is to be hardened is exposed to the electric field of an inductor in<br>
order to be heated and is then quenched.<br>
Large-size rolling bearings in the sense of the present patent application are to be<br>
understood as rolling bearings whose bearing rings are bolted through axially<br>
introduced passage and/or threaded bores with the connecting structures. Depending on<br>
their layout, large-size rolling bearings may be comprised of one or more ball or roller<br>
arrays. Appurtenant to each ball or roller array are two races which are finished by<br>
metal cutting in two to three bearing rings and subsequently hardened. Such bearing<br>
rings can be formed as nose rings, support rings, holder rings, disk-like axial rings,<br>
external rings or internal rings, etc.<br>
The races of the bearing rings of large-size rolling bearings are hardened in feed<br>
operation with one or two inductors, applying a prior art method. According to this<br>
inductive feed hardening method, a so-called inductor, i.e. an induction coil or a pair of<br>
induction coils is provided for heating of the race, while for quenching a sprinkler<br>
fastened to the inductor and provided for feeding of cooling liquid is arranged above a<br>
zone of the race to be hardened which is small in relation to the ring diameter. During<br>
hardening, the inductor and the sprinkler once pass over the contour of the race of the<br>
entire ring in peripheral direction at constant feedrate of the ring, so that each segment<br>
of the race is continuously heated and quenched.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/087152	PCT/EP2006/001266<br>
2<br>
With this prior art method, a small segment (slip), which due to the process applied is<br>
incompletely heated, still remains at the end point of hardening, in the area of which the<br>
race remains softer.<br>
Furthermore, according to the method described in DE 10228333 Cl, the races of the<br>
bearing rings of large-size rolling bearings can be simultaneously heated with annular<br>
inductors by applying a full-surface recirculating heating process, which is also called<br>
shot-hardening, and subsequently be hardened by quenching. The benefit of this method<br>
lies in avoiding the soft spot described before.<br>
Applying this method involves relatively high costs for the inductors as well as high<br>
generator performance rates. With very large rings, a uniform heating is problematic<br>
due to temperature-conditioned dilatation.<br>
Now, therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
producing bearing rings for large-size rolling bearings by which high peripherally<br>
constant hardness, i.e. without any slip, can be achieved in the races.<br>
The solution to this task is indicated in claim 1. Sub-claims 2 to 7 contain purposive<br>
complementary measures.<br>
According to the inventive solution, it is provided for that<br>
a)	at the beginning of hardening, at least two inductors are arranged above a joint<br>
zone (a) of the annular race to be hardened and heat the peripheral layer<br>
juxtaposed there to the hardening temperature;<br>
b)	for heating of the subsequent middle zone (b), the inductors can be moved in<br>
opposite direction along the annular race;<br>
c)	after covering a short distance, sprinklers directed onto the heated peripheral<br>
layers are turned-on and these layers are quenched, proceeding from the center<br>
of the zone (a) heated at the beginning;<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/087152	PCT/EP2006/001266<br>
3<br>
d)	the inductors and the sprinklers are continually moved on their ring halves until<br>
they coincide again at a zone (c) lying opposite to the point of departure and<br>
again form a joint heating zone there;<br>
e)	after reaching the required hardening temperature of the zone (c), both inductors<br>
are lifted perpendicular from the surface of the race, and<br>
f)	sprinklers are directed onto the zone (c).<br>
With the inventive method, at least two inductors, preferably two induction coils or two<br>
pairs of induction coils, and sprinklers preferably fastened thereto, are arranged above a<br>
zone of the race to be hardened which is small in relation to the ring diameter. At the<br>
beginning of this method, both inductors are arranged directly side by side and heat the<br>
race peripheral layer lying underneath to the hardening temperature (vide Pos.I in the<br>
attached FIGS. 1 and 3). The configuration of a joint heating zone with a constant depth<br>
can be achieved by a pendulum-like movement of the inductors or of the ring and by<br>
way of an adapted performance control. Subsequently, the two inductors move apart at<br>
constant feed in opposite peripheral direction each along the annular peripheral layer of<br>
the race to be hardened. Having covered a short distance, the sprinklers which are<br>
preferably pivoted to the inductors are turned-on and quench the center of the zone<br>
heated at the beginning and divide the zone heated to the hardening temperature into<br>
two halves. At a constant feed, each inductor subsequently passes over the race surface<br>
of one half of the ring diameter in opposite direction (Pos. II) until both inductors again<br>
coincide at a race section lying opposite to the point of departure and form a joint<br>
heating zone (Pos. IS). As a variant to the method described in FIG. 1, it is possible to<br>
provide for a simultaneous pre-warming of the area lying opposite to the point of<br>
departure by way of a third inductor (vide FIG. 2). The third inductor is removed as<br>
soon as the other two inductors approach each other for hardening this zone and form a<br>
joint heating zone analogously to Pos. Ill of FIG. 1. When both inductors have formed a<br>
joint, closed heating zone wherein the race surface temperature ranges at the hardening<br>
temperature, both inductors move vertically away from the surface. By swivelling the<br>
sprinkler jet into the space between the race surface and the inductors, the joint heating<br>
zone is simultaneously quenched.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/087152	PCT/E2006/001266<br>
4<br>
As a measure designed to assure uniform, even heating of the race in the areas of joint<br>
heating zones of both inductors, it is additionally possible to provide grooves or bores,<br>
preferably extending radially or axially, at the peripheral rims of the races.<br>
The present invention is further elucidated by way of the attached FIGS. 1 to 4 taken as<br>
examples, where:<br>
FIG. 1 and 2   are perspective views of a bearing ring with various inductor positions I<br>
to IV;<br>
FIG.3	shows a schematic cross section of the inductors 2 and sprinklers 5 in<br>
various inductor positions I to IV;<br>
FIG. 4a	shows a circular segment of race 3 with a representation of the joint<br>
heating zones a, c; and<br>
FIG. 4b	shows an embodiment modified versus FIG. 4a with bores or grooves 6<br>
introduced at the peripheral rims of race 3 and leading to the represented<br>
magnified view of the joint heating zones a, c.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the bearing ring 1 with the axial race 3 to be hardened, and the inductors 2<br>
in various inductor positions I to IV. In position I, at the beginning of heating, zone (a)<br>
shown in dashed lines is heated. The two inductors 2 then move along the annular race 3<br>
in the direction of the arrow via the position II with the appurtenant central heating<br>
zones (b) into position III with the heating zone (c) there. Upon the end of heating, the<br>
inductors 2 are lifted in axial direction from position III into position IV so that the<br>
sprinklers pivoted to inductors 2 can also quench the peripheral layer in the area of<br>
zone (c).<br>
<br>
Schematically shown in FIG. 3 are the inductors 2 and sprinklers 5 in the four different<br>
inductor positions I and IV. In positions I to III, sprinklers 5 are arranged above at the<br>
relevant inductors 2. In positions II and III, the sprinkler jets are shown in dashed lines<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/087152	PCT/EP2006/001266<br>
5<br>
and directed onto the peripheral layer of the race which has just been heated by the aid<br>
of inductors 2. In position I, the inductors 2 are still arranged directly side by side and<br>
sprinklers 5 have been turned off. In position II, the inductors 2 have moved away a<br>
short distance from the 0° line and the sprinkler jets are obliquely directed backwardly<br>
on the race. In position III, the inductors 2 have again been united up to the 180° line.<br>
By lifting the inductors 2 after position IV, the sprinklers pivoted to the inductors are so<br>
swivelled that the sprinkler jets are initially directed perpendicular onto the peripheral<br>
layer and later-on, if required, even on the surface under inductors 2.<br>
Additionally shown in the variant according to FIG. 2 is the inductor 4 for pre-heating<br>
which is removed from this area as soon as the other two inductors 2 approach this area.<br>
From FIG. 4ab and 4b it becomes evident how the joint heating zones (a), (c) are<br>
enhanced if appropriate bores or grooves 6 are introduced at the peripheral rims of<br>
race 3.	i<br>
