BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to new polynucleotides deriving from the nucleotide sequence of the erythropoietin gene (EPO) and comprising new SNPs, new polypeptides derived from the natural erythropoietin protein and comprising mutations caused by these SNPs as well as their therapeutic uses.<br>
Related Art.	'<br>
The erythropoietin gene, hereinafter referred to as EPO, is described in the publication Jacobs K. et al. (1985) "Isolation and charatterization of genomic and cDNA clones of human erythropoietin"; Nature 313 (6005), 806-810.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of this gene is accessible under accession number X02158 in the GenBank database.<br>
The erythropoietin protein is known to act on proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of progenitor cells of erythropoiesis. It determines their differentiation and maturation into erythrocytes.<br>
EPO is also known to act as autocrine factor on certain erythroleukemic cells and to be a mitogen and a chemoattractant for endothelial cells.<br><br>
EPO is also known to, stimulate activated and differentiated B-cells and to enhance B-ell immunoglobulin production and proliferation.<br>
EPO synthesis is subject to a complex control circuit which links kidney and bone narrow in a feedback loop. Synthesis depends on venous oxygen partial pressure and is ncreased under hypoxic conditions.<br>
EPO production is influenced also by a variety of other humoral factors, such as estosterone, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, and catecholamines. In contrast, several ;ytokine? such as IL-1, lL-6, and TNF-alpha, reduce EPO synthesis.<br>
In the cell, binding of EPO to its receptor induces:<br>
-	a release of membrane phospholipids,<br>
-	the synthesis of diacyl glycerol,<br>
-	an increase in intracellular calcium levels,<br>
-	an increase in intracellular pH, and<br>
-	an increase in intracellular phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, the latter<br>
inducing fos and myc oncogenes.<br>
Excess of EPO is known to lead to erythrocytosis. This is accompanied by an increase in blood-viscosity and cardiac output and may lead also to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. A significant reduction of platelets is also observed.<br>
Thrombosis is another adverse effect of an excess of EPO.<br>
Pulmonary and cerebral embolism, i.e. the sudden obliteration of a blood vessel by a clot or an extraneous compound transported by the blood, also constitutes a serious adverse effect related to EPO consumption.<br>
However, when the amount of synthesized EPO is too low as it is in the case of severe kidney insufficiencies, anemias are often observed. Thus, EPO is often administered to patients with severe kidney insufficiency, with hematocrit below 0.3, in particular in dialysis patients.<br>
The most important complication in the treatment with EPO is hypertony, the increases in urea, potassium, and phosphate levels, an increase in blood viscosity, an expansion of Ihrombopoietic progenitor cells and circulating platelets.<br>
EPO is also used to activate erythropoiesis, allowing the collection of autologous donor blood.<br><br>
Moreover, JbPU use has been suggested also for non-renal forms of anemia induced, for example, by chronic infections, inflammatory processes, radiation therapy, and cytostatic drug treatment.<br>
To a certain extent EPO is also a stimulating factor of megakaryocytopoiesis. The activity of EPO is synergized by IL-4.<br>
EPO seems to possess neuroprotective capabilities since it has been demonstrated that EPO protects neurons against cell death induced by ischemia, probably by reducing free radicals production and by reducing oxidative stress effects<br>
It is known that the EPO gene is involved in different human disorders and/or diseases, such as different cancers like carcinomas, melanomas, myelomas, tumors, leukemia, and cancers of the liver, neck, head, and kidneys; cardiovascular diseases such as brain injury; metabolic diseases such as those not related to the immune system like obesity; infectious diseases, in particular viral infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and AIDS; pneumonia; ulcerative colitis; central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression; tissue or organ graft rejection; wounds healing; anemia; allergy; asthma; multiple sclerosis; osteoporosis; psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; autoinimune diseases and disorders; genital or venereal warts; gastrointestinal disorders; and disorders related to treatments by chemotherapy.<br>
, The inventors have found new polypeptide and new polynucleotide analogs to the EPO gene capable of having a different functionality from the natural wild-type EPO protein.<br>
These new polypeptides and polynucleotides can notably be used to treat or prevent the disorders or diseases previously mentioned and avoid all or part of the disadvantages, which are tied to them.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has as its first object new polynucleotides that differ from the nucleotide sequence of the reference wild-type EPO gene, in that they comprise one or several SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism).<br>
The nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 of the human reference wild-type EPO gene is composed of 3398 nucleotides and comprises a coding sequence of 2149 nucleotides, from nucleotide 615 (start codon) to the nucleotide 2763 (stop codon).<br>
The EPO gene is composed of five exons whose positions on the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 are the following:<br><br>
Exon 1: from nucleotide 397 to nucleotide 627 (comprises the start codon at position 615).<br>
Exon 2: from nucleotide 1194 to nucleotide 1339.<br>
Exon 3: from nucleotide 1596 to nucleotide 1682,<br>
Exon 4: from nucleotide 2294 to nucleotide 2473.<br>
Exon 5: from nucleotide 2608 to nucleotide 3327 (comprises the slop codon at position 2763).<br>
The applicant has identified. 12 SNPs in the nucleotide sequence of the reference wild-type EPO gene.<br>
These 12 SNPs are the following: 465-486 (deletion), c577t, g602c, cl288t, c]347t, tl607c, gl644a, g2228a, g2357a, c2502t, c2621g, g2634a.<br>
It is understood, in the sense of the present invention, that the numbering corresponding to the positioning of the SNP previously defined is relative to the numbering of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br>
The letters a, t, c, and g correspond respectively to the nitrogenous bases adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.<br>
The first letter corresponds to the wild-type nucleotide, whereas the last letter corresponds to the mutated nucleotide.<br>
Thus, for example, the SNP gl644a corresponds to a mutation of the nucleotide g (guanine) at position 1644 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 of the reference wild-type EPO gene into a nucleotide a (adenine). The SNP 465-486 (deletion) corresponds to a mutation in which the 22 nucleotides from positions 465 to 486 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 of the reference wild-type EPO gene have been deleted.<br>
These SNPs have each been identified by the applicant using the determination process described in applicant's patent application FR 00 22894, entitled "Process for the determination of one or several functional polymorphism(s) in the nucleotide sequence of a preselected functional candidate gene and its applications" and filed December 6, 2000, cited here by way of reference.<br>
The process described in this patent application permits the identification of one (or several) preexisting SNP(s) in at least one individual from a random population of individuals.<br>
In the scope of the present invention, a fragment of the nucleotide sequence of the EPO gene, comprising, for example, the coding sequence, was isolated from different<br><br>
individuals in a population of individuals chosen in a random manner.<br>
Sequencing of these fragments was then carried out on certain of these samples aving a heteroduplex profile (that is a profile different from that of the reference wild-type !P0 gene sequence) after analysis by PHPLC ("Denaturing-High Performance Liquid<br>
Chromatography").<br>
The fragment sequenced in this way was then compared to the nucleotide sequence of<br>
he fragment of the reference wild-type EPO gene and the SNPs in conformity with the nvention identified.<br>
.. Thus, the SNPs are natural and each of them is present in certain individuals of the vorld population.<br>
The reference wild-type EPO gene codes for an immature protein of 193 amino acids, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ED NO. 2, that will be converted to a mature protein of 166 amino acids, by cleavage of the signal peptide that includes the first 27 amino acids.<br>
The structure of the natural wild-type EPO protein comprises four helices called A, B, C, and D. The crystal structure of EPO complexed with the EPO receptor indicates that only the three helices A, C, and D are involved in EPO binding with its receptor (Syed et al. (1998). Efficiency of signaling through cytokine receptors depends critically on receptor orientation. Nature 395:511-516). In addition, site directed mutagenesis studying the active site of EPO demonstrates that changes in amino acids situated in helix B have a limited effect on EPO activity (Eliott et al. (1997). Mapping of the active site of recombinant human erythropoietin. Blood. 89: 493-502 ; Wen et al. (1994). Erythropoietin structure-function relationships. Identification of functionally important domains. J. Biol. Chem. 269:22839-22846).<br>
Each of the coding SNPs of the invention, namely: g 1644a, g2357a, c262lg, causes modifications, at the level of the amino acid sequence, of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the EPO gene.<br>
These modifications in the amino acid sequence are the following:<br>
The coding SNP gl644a causes a mutation of the amino acid aspartic acid (D) at position 70 in the immature protein of the EPO gene, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, in asparagine (N) and at position 43 of the mature protein. In the description of the present invention, one will call the mutation encoded by this SNP D43N or D70N according to whether one refers to the mature protein or to the immature protein<br><br>
respectively.<br>
The coding SNP g2357a causes a mutation of the amino acid glycine (G) at position 104 in the immature protein of the EPO gene, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, in serine (S) and at position 77 of the mature protein. In the description of the present invention, one will call the mutation encoded by this SNP G77S or G104S according to whether one refers to the mature protein or to the immature protein respectively.<br>
The coding SNP c262Ig causes a mutation of the amino acid serine (S) at position 147 in the immature protein of the EPO gene, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, in cysteine (C) and at position 120 of the mature protein. In the description of the present invention, one will call the mutation encoded by this SNP S120C or S147C according to whether one refers to the mature protein or to the immature protein respectively.<br>
The coding SNPS'gl644a, g2357a, and c2621g, cause modifications of the spatial conformation of the polypeptides in conformity with the invention compared to the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type reference EPO gene.<br>
These modifications can be observed by cornputational molecular modeling, according to methods that are well known to a person skilled in the art, making use of, for example, the modeling tools de novo (for example, SEQFOLD/MSI), homology (for example, MODELER/MSI), minimization of the force field (for example, DISCOVER, DELPHI/MSI) and/or molecular dynamics (for example, CFF/MSI).<br>
Examples of such models are given hereinafter in the experimental section.<br>
1/ Computational molecular modeling indicates that the mutation D43N on the mutated mature protein involves a structural modification of the loop located between helix A and helix B of the EPO protein, as well as a variation in the structure of the long loop connecting helices C and D of the EPO protein in the area from PI29 to 1133 amino acids. Those residues are located in front of the mutated amino acid N43. Since this mutation is located near the short helix F48-R53 involved in the binding to the EPO receptor, it may have an effect on the interaction of the EPO protein with its receptor. The D43 residue is highly conserved in all EPO orthologues. It could form salt bridges with positively charged residues (K45, R131), which are also conserved in EPO orthologues.<br>
Thus, the mutated protein possesses a different three-dimensional conformation from the natural wild-type EPO protein encoded by the wild-type EPO gene.<br>
Computational molecular modeling also predicts that the presence of the asparagine amino acid at position 43 involves a significant modification of the structure and of the<br><br>
function of the natural wild-type EPO protein.<br>
2/ Computational molecular modeling indicates that the mutation G77S on the mature mutated protein involves the total unfolding of the C-terminal end of heHx B caused by a steric hindrance with the phenylalanine residue at position 183 on helix D and by an unfavorable interaction between an hydrophilic (serine at position 77) and an hydrophobic (leucine at position 35) amino acids on the loop between helix A and helix B. The G77 residue is buried in the wild-type.protein Structure.<br>
Thus, the mutated protein possesses a different three-dimensional confonnation from the natural wild-type EPO protein encoded by the wild-type EPO gene.<br>
Computational molecular modeling also predicts that the presence of the amino acid serine at position 77 involves a significant modification of the structure and of the function of the natural wild-type EPO protein, notably by altering the affinity of the EPO for its receptor.<br>
3/ Computational molecular modeling indicates that the mutation S120C on the mature mutated protein involves a structural modification located on the loop between helix C and helix D, in particular between the lysine at position 116 and the alanine at position 125. The hydrogen bond between S120 and KM6 residues in the wild-type EPO protein structure is disrupted in the mutated protein structure.<br>
Thus, the mutated protpin possesses a different three-dimensional conformation from the natural wild-type EPO protein encoded by the wild-type EPO gene.<br>
Computational molecular modeling also predicts that the presence of the cysteine amino acid at position 120 involves a significant modification of the structure and of the function of the natural wild-type EPO protein.<br>
Other SNPs in conformity with the invention, namely: 465-486 (deletion), c577t, g602c, cl288t, cl347t, tl607c, g2228a, c2502t, g2634a, do not involve modification of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the EPO gene at the level of the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2.<br>
The SNPs cl288t, tl607c, g2634a are silent and the SNPs 465-486 (deletion), c577t, g602c, cl347t, g2228a, c2502t are non-coding.<br>
Genotyping of the polynucleotides in conformity with the invention can be carried out in such a fashion as to detennine the allelic frequency of these polynucleotides in a population. Two examples of genotyping are given, hereinafter in the experimental part, for the SNPs gl644a and c2621g.<br><br>
The determination of the functionality of the polypeptides of the invention can equally be carried out by a test of their biological activity according to protocols described in (he<br>

The invention also has for an object the use of polynucleotides and of polypeptides in conformity with the invention as well as of therapeutic molecules obtained and/or identified starting from these polynucleotides and polypeptides, notably for the prevention and the treatment of certain human disorders and/or diseases.<br>

A nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide or polynucleotide sequence is defined as one that can hybridize with this nucleotide sequence, under stringent conditions.<br>
By "stringent hybridization conditions" is generally but not necessarily understood the chemical conditions that,permit a hybridization when the nucleotide sequences have an identity of at least 80%, preferably greater than or equal to 90%, still more preferably greater than or equal to 95 % and most preferably greater than or equal to 97 %.<br>
The stringent conditions can be obtained according to methods well known to a person skilled in the art and, for example, by an incubation of the polynucleotides, at 42oC, in a solution comprising 50 % formamide, SxSSC (150 mM of NaCl, 15 mM of trisodium citrate), 50μM of sodium phosphate (pH - 7.6), 5x Denhardt Solution, 10 % dextran sulfate and ;20μg denatured salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters at 0.1x SSC, at<br>

According to the invention, the genotyping may be carried out on an individual or a population of individuals.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, genotyping is defined as a process for the<br>
determination of the genotype of an individual or of a population of individuals. Genotype<br>
consists of the alleles present at one or more specific loci.	'  ' ^<br>
"Population of individuals" is understood as a group of determined individuals selected in random or non-random fashion. These individuals can be humans, animals, microorganisms or plants.<br>
Usually, the group of individuals comprises at least 10 persons, preferably from 100 to 300 persons.<br>
The individuals can be selected according to their ethnicity or according to their phenotype, notably those who are affected by the following disorders and/or diseases: cancers and tumors, infectious diseases, venereal diseases, immunologically related diseases and/or autoimmune diseases and disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, central nervous system diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and disorders connected with chemotherapy treatments.<br>
Said cancers and tumors include carcinomas comprising metastasizing renal carcinomas, melanomas, lymphomas comprising follicular lymphomas and cutaneous T cell lymphoma, leukemias comprising chronic lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, cancers of the liver, neck, head and kidneys, multiple myelomas, carcinoid tumors and tumors that appear following an immune deficiency comprising Kaposi's sarcoma in the case of AIDS.<br>

Said metabolic diseases may include such non-immune associated diseases as obesily.<br>
Said diseases of the central nervous system may include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and depression.<br>
Said diseases and disorders may also include wound healing and osteoporosis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may preferably be used for the preparation of a therapeutic compound intended to increase the production of autologous blood, notably in patients participating in a differed autologous blood collection program to avoid the use of blood from an other person.<br>
A functional SNP according to the invention is preferably genotyped in a population of individuals.<br>
Many technologies exist which can be implemented in order to genotype SNPs (see notably Kwok Pharmacogenomics, 2000, vol 1, pp 95-100. "High-throughput gcnolyping assay approaches"). These technologies are based on one of the four following principles: allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization, oligonucleotide elongation by dideoxynucleotides optionally in the presence of deoxynucleotides, ligation of allele specific oligonucleotides or cleavage of allele specific oligonucleotides. Each of these technologies can be coupled to a detection system such as measurement of direct or polarized fluorescence, or mass spectrometry.<br>
Genotyping can notably be carried out by minisequencing with hot ddNTPs (2 different ddNTPs labeled by different fluorophores) and cold ddNTPs (2 different non labeled ddNTPs), in connection with a polarized fluorescence scanner. The minisequencing protocol with reading of polarized fluorescence (FP-TDI Technology or Fluorescence Polarization Template-direct Dye-Terminator Incorporation) is well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
It can be carried out on a product obtained after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the DNA of each individual. This PCR product is selected to cover the polynucleotide genie region containing the studied SNP. After the last step in the PCR thermocycler, the plate is placed on a polarized fluorescence scanner for a reading of the labeled bases by using fluorophore specific excitation and emission filters. The intensity values of the labeled bases are reported on a graph.<br>
For the PCR amplification, in the case of a SNP of the invention, the sense and<br><br>
anlisense primers, respectively, can-easily be selected by a person skilled in the art according to the position of the SNPs of the invention.	For example, the sense and antisense nucleotide sequences for the PCR amplification of a fragment whose sequence comprises the SNPs g2228a, g2357a, c2502l, c2621g and/or g2634a can be, respectively:<br>
SEQ ID NO. 3: Sense primer (A): TTGCATACCTTCTGTTTGCT SEQ ID NO. 4: Antisense primer (B): CACAAGCAATGTTGGTGAG<br>
These nucleotide sequences permit amplification of a fragment havirig a length of 626 nucleotides, of the nucleotide 2192 to the nucleotide 2817 in the nucleotide seguence SEQ ID NO. L<br>
A statistical analysis of the frequency of each allele (allelic frequency) encoded by the gene comprising the SNP in the population of individuals is then achieved, which permits determination of the importance of their impact and their distribution in the different sub-groups and notably, if necessary, the diverse ethnic groups that constitute this population of individuals.<br>
The gcnolyping dala arc analyzed in order lo estimate tiic distribution frequency of the different alleles observed in the studied populations. The calculations of the allelic frequencies can be carried out with the help of software such as SAS-suile® (SAS) or SPLUS® (MathSofl). The comparison of the allelic distributions of a SNP of the invention across different ethnic groups of the population of individuals can be carried out by means of the software ARLEQUIN® and SAS-suite®.<br>
The present invention also concerns the use of a polynucleotide according lo the invention for the research of one variation in the EPO nucleotide sequence in one individual.<br>
SNPs of the invention as genetic markers<br><br>
Whereas SlStPs modifying functional sequences of genes (e.g. promoter, splicing sites, coding region) are likely to be directly related to disease susceptibility or resistance, all SNPs (functional or not) may provide valuable markers for the identification of one or several genes involved in these disease states and, consequently, may be indirectly related to these disease states (See Cargi]) et al. (1999), Nature Genetics 22:231-238; Riley et al. (2000). Pharmacogenomics I:39"47; Roberts L. (2000). Science 287: 1898-1899).<br>

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
Example 1: Modeling of the protein encoded by a polynucleotide of nucleotide sequence containing the SNP Rl644a, R2357a, or c262lg and of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type reference gene.<br>
In a first step, the three-dimensional structure of erythropoietin was constructed starting from that available in the PDB database (code lEER) and by using the software<br>
i<br>
Modeler (MSI, San Diego, CA). The mature polypeptide fragment was then modified in such a fashion as to reproduce the mutation D70Nj G104S or S147C. A thousand molecular minimization steps were conducted on this mutated fragment by using the programs AMBER and DISCOVER (MSI: Molecular Simulations Inc.)- Two molecular dynamic calculation runs were then carried out with the same program and the same force fields. In each case, 50,000 steps were calculated at 300oK, terminated by 300 equilibration steps. The result of this modeling is shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3.<br>
Example 2: Genotyping of the SNPs el 644a and c2621gin a population of individuals.<br>
The genotyping of SNPs is based on the principle of the minisequencing wherein the product is detected by a reading of polarized fluorescence. The technique consists of a fluorescent minisequencing (FP-TDI Technology or Fluorescence Polarization Template-direct Dye-terminator Incorporation). The minisequencing is performed on a product amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of each individual of the population. This PCR product is chosen in such a manner that it covers the genie region containing the SNP to be genotyped. After elimination of the PCR primers and the dNTPs that have not been incorporated, the minisequencmg is carried out. The minisequencing consists of lengthening an oligonucleotide primer, placed just upstream of the site of the SNP, by using a polymerase enzNTne and fluorolabeled dideoxynucleotides. The product resulting from this lengthening process is directly analyzed by a reading of polarized fluorescence. All these steps, as well as the reading, are carried out in the same PCR plate.<br>
Thus, the genotyping requires 5 steps:<br>
1)	Amplification by PCR<br>
2)	Purification of the PCR product by enzymatic digestion<br>
3)	Elongation of the oligonucleotide pnmer<br>
4)	Reading<br>
5)	Interpretation of the reading<br><br>
Step 1) Amplification by PCR.<br>
The PCR amplification of the nucleotide sequence of the EPO gene is carried out starting from genomic DNA coming from 268 individuals of ethnically diverse origins. These genomic DNAs were provided by the Coriell histitute in the United States. The 268 individuals are distributed as follows:<br><br>
The genomic DNA coming from each one of these individuals constitutes a sample. The PCR amplification is earned out from primers which can easily be designed by<br><br>
the person skilled in the art on the basis of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. K<br>
For the genotyping of gl644a, the PCR amplification is carried out using the<br>
following primers;<br>
SEQ ID NO. 5: Sense primer: TTCAGGGACCCTTGACTC SEQ ID NO. 6: Antisense primer: GATCATTCTGCCTTTCATCC<br>
These nucleotide sequences permit amplification of a fragment of a length of 208 nucleotides,<br>
from the nucleotide 1557 to the nucleotide 1764 in the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br>
j -For the genotyping of c2621g, the PCR amplification is carried out using the<br>
following primers:<br>
SEQ ID NO. 7: Sense primer: TTGCATACCTTCTGTTTGGT<br>
SEQ ID NO. 8: Antisense primer: CACAAGCAATGTTGGTGAG These nucleotide sequences permit amplification of a fragment of a length of 626 nucleotides, from the nucleotide 2192 to the nucleotide 2817 in the nucleotide sequence SEQ ED NO. 1.<br>
For each SNP to be genotyped, the PCR product will serve as a template for the minisequencing.<br>
The total reaction volume of the PCR reaction is 5 }il per sample. This reaction volume is composed of the reagents indicated in the following table:<br><br>
These reagents are distributed in a black PCR plate having 384 wells provided by ABGene (ref :TF-0384-k). The plate is sealed, centrifuged, then placed in a thermocycler for 384-vvel! plates (Tetrad of MJ Research) and undergoes the following incubation: PCR Cycles: 1 mm at 94° C, followed by 36 cycles composed of 3 steps (15 sec. at 94"* C, 30 sec. at 56° C, 1 min<br>
at 68° C).<br>
Step 2) Purification of the PCR product by enzymatic digestion.<br><br>
The PCR amplified product is then purified using two enzymes: Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) and exonuclease I (Exo I). The first enzyme permits the dephosphorylation of the dNTPs which have not been incorporated during the PCR amplification, whereas the second eliminates the remaining single stranded DNA, in particular the primers which have not been used during the PCR. This digestion is done by addition, in each well of the PCR plate, of a reaction mixture of 5 ^1 per sample.<br>
This reaction mixture is composed of the following reagents:<br><br><br><br>
The sequences of the two minisequencing primers necessary for the genotyping were determined in a way to correspond to the sequence of the nucleotides located upstream of the site of a SNP according to the invention. The PCR product that contains the SNP being a double stranded DNA product, the genotyping can therefore be done either on the sense strand or on the antisense strand. The selected primers are manufactured by Life Technologies Inc.<br>
For the SNP gl644a, the minisequencing primers tested are the following: SEQ ID NO. 9: Sense primer (A): tgcagcttgaatgagaatatcactgtccca SEQ ID NO. 10: Antisense primer (B): cctcttccaggcatagaaattaactttggtgt<br>
The minisequencing of the SNP gl644a was first validated over 48 samples, then genotyped over the set of the population of individuals composed of 268 individuals and 11 negative controls.  Several minisequencing conditions were tested and the following optimal condition was retained for the genotyping of gl644a: Antisense primer + ddCTP-Rl 10 -f ddTTP-Tamra<br>
For the SNP c2621g, the minisequencing primers tested are the following: SEQ H) NO. 11: Sense primer (A): ttggcagaaggaagccalct SEQ ED NO. 12: Antisense primer (B): Qtgaggccgcatctggaggg<br>
The minisequencing of the SNP c2621g was first validated over 48 samples, then genotyped over the set of the population of individuals composed of 268 individuals and 10 negative controls. Several minisequencing conditions were tested and the following optimal condition was retained for the genotyping of c2621g:<br>
Sense primer + ddCTP-Rl 10 + ddGTP-Tamia Once filled, the plate is sealed, centrifuged, then placed in a thermocycler for 384-well plates<br><br>
(Tetrad of MJ Research) and undergoes the following incubation: Elongation cycles: 1 min. at 93° C, followed by 35 cycles composed of 2 steps (10 sec. at 93oC, 3.0 sec. at 55° C).<br>
After the last step in the thermocycler, the plate is directly placed on a polarized fluorescence reader of type Analyst® HT of LJL Biosystems Inc. The plate is read using Criterion Host® software by using two methods. The first permits reading the Tamra labeled base by using emission and excitation filters specific for this fluorophore (excitation 550-10 nm, emission 580-10 nm) and the second permits reading the Rl 10 labeled base by using the excitation and emission filters specific for this fluorophore (excitation 490-10 nm, emission 520-10 nm). In the two cases, a dichroic double mirror (R110/Tamra) is used and the other reading parameters are:<br>
Z-height: 1.5 mm<br>
Attenuator: out<br>
Integration time: 100,000 usee.<br>
Raw data units: counts/sec<br>
Switch polarization: by well<br>
Plate settling time: 0 msec<br>
PMT setup: Smart Read (+), sensitivity 2<br>
Dynamic polarizer: emission	<br>
Static polarizer: S A file result is thus obtained containing the calculated values of mP (milliPolarization) for the Tamra filter and that for the Rl 10 filter. These mP values are calculated from the intensity values obtained on the parallel plane (//) and on the perpendicular plane (-L) according to the following formula :<br>
mP=1000(//-g±)/(// + gl).	-<br>
In this calculation, the value 1 is weighted by a factor g. It is a machine parameter that must be determined experimentally beforehand.<br>
Steps 4) and 5) Interpretation of the reading and determination of the genotypes.<br>
The mP values are reported on a graph using Microsoft Inc. Excel software, and/or Allele Caller® software developed by LJL Biosystems Inc.<br>
'   On the abscissa is indicated the mP value of the Tamra labeled base, on the ordinate is indicated the mP value of the Rl 10 labeled base. A strong mP value indicates that the base<br><br>
labeled with this fluorophore is incorporated and, conversely, a weak mP value reveals the absence of incorporation of this base.<br>
Up to three homogenous groups of nucleotide sequences having different genotypes are obtained.<br>
The use of the Allele Caller® software permits, once the identification of the different groups is carried out, to directly extract the genotype defined for each individual in table form.<br>
Resultsof theminisequencingfor the SNPs gl644a and C2621R.<br>
After the completion of the genotyping process, the determination of the genotypes of the individuals of the population of individuals for the two functional SNPs studied here was carried out using the graphs described above.<br>
For the SNP gl644a, this genotype is in theory either homozygote GG, or heterozygote GA or homozygote AA in the tested individuals. In reality, and as shown below, the homozygote genotype AA is not detected in the population of individuals.<br>
Similarly, for the SNP c2621g, this genotype is in theory either homozygote CC, or heterozygote GG, or homozygote GG in the tested individuals. In reality, and as shown below, the homozygote genotype GG is not detected in the population of individuals.<br>

Example 3: Study of the biological function of G104S mutated ervthropoietin compared to that of natural wild-type erythropoietin<br>
The first step consists of preparing mutated and wild-type EPO proteins<br>
a)	Clonina of the natural wild-type erythropoietin and mutated erythropoietin<br>
(g2357a) in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/His-Topo carrying<br>
the geneticin-resistance gene<br>
hi comparison to the sequence of the erythropoeitin protein    published in SwissProt, the polyhistidine tagged EPO cDNA from the Genestorm clone (H-X02158M -Invitrogen) harbored the K143E (G427AG) mutation (the number in subscript corresponds to the nucleotide position on the cDNA sequence). Thus, we first restituted the natural wild-type E143 (A427AG) sequence using the Exsite PCR kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: SEQ ID NO. 13: Sense primer: CCAGAAGGAAGCCATCTCCCCT SEQ ID NO. 14: Antisense primer (phosphorylated on the 5' end): GCTCCCAGAGCCCGAAGCAG<br>
In parallel, the G104S (G310GC =&gt; AGC) mutated erythropoietin was obtained using the Exsite PCR kit (Stratagene corp.) and the following primers:<br>
SEQ ID NO. 15: Sense primer: CGGAGCCAAGCCCTGTTGGTCA SEQ ID NO. 16: Antisense primer (phosphorylated on the 5' end): CAGGACAGCTTCCGACAGCA<br>
To remove the polyhistidine tail and isolate the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the complete EPO protein (i.e. natural signal peptide and mature protein), whether mutated or wild-type form, a PCR amplification was carried out using the following primers; SEQ ID NO. 17: Sense primer: ATGGGGGTGCACGAATGTCC SEQ ID NO. 18: Antisense primer: TCATCTGTCCCCTGTCCTGC The    PCR    products    are    inserted    in    the    eukaryotic    expression    vector pcDNA3.1/GS/HisTopo (TOPO™-cloning; Invitrogen Corp.) under the control of the CMV promoter. This vector allows the constitutive expression of proteins in eukaryotic cell lines.<br>
After checking of the nucleotide sequence of the vector region coding for the recombinant proteins, the different recombinant expression vectors are transfected into the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) using Superfect (QIAgen).<br>
b)	Selection of clones over-expressing natural wild-type or mutated EPO<br>
Two days after the transfection with the various EPO constructs, the CHO cells are<br><br>
placed in a culture medium containing 800 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen). As a result of a 2-week growth in these culture conditions, stable cells over-expressing EPO are selected. The cells are then cloned by the limited dilution method. Thirty clones from cells transfected with either wild-type or mutated. EPO are screened for expression of the EPO protein using an EPO ELISA (R&amp;D Systems). Several EPO-expressing clones are picked and kepi-frozen. Among them, the clone producing the highest amount of either wild-type or mutated EPO was used for EPO mass production.<br>
c)	Purification of EPO proteins	^<br>
After EPO expression in the CHO culture, the culture medium is centrifuged at 1500<br>
rpm for 20 minutes permitting recovery of the supernatant. The supernatant is then concentrated 10 times using Labscale (Millipore membrane 5 Kda), dialyzed against 3 liters of buffer Tris 50 mM, NaCl 25 mM pH 9 and purified on an anion exchange column (Pharmacia, HiprepQ). After protein elution using a step at 200 mM NaCl, the protein is desalted against buffer NaHaPOa 50 mM, NaCl 25 mM, pH 7 and purified on Heparine HP (Pharmacia). Protein elution is then carried out using a step at 150 mM NaCl. Finally, the EPO protein is analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel characterization followed by a quantification using densitometry (Biorad densitometer GS800).<br>
The second step consists of preparing 32D murine cells over-expressing the EPO receptor.<br>
d)	Cloning of the natural EPO receptor in  the eukaryotic  expression  vector<br>
pcDNA3.1/GS/HisTopo carrying the zeocyn-resistance gene:<br>
To further insert the cDNA in frame with the V5 epitope and a polyhistidine tail, the complete sequence of the natural human EPO receptor cDNA from the Genestorm clone (H-M60459M - Invitrogen) is amplified by PCR using the following primers: SEQ ID NO. 19: Sense primer: ATGGACCACCTCGGGGCGTC SEQ ID NO. 20: Antisense primer: AGAGCAAGCCACATAGCTGGGGG<br>
The PCR product is inserted into the eukaryofic expression vector pcDNA3,l/GS/HisTopo (TOPO™-cloning', Invitrogen Corp.) under the control of the CMV promoter. This vector allows constitutive expression of proteins in eukaryotic cells lines. In this case, the EPO receptor is tagged with an additional C-terminal sequence containing a<br><br>
poly-histidine tail,and a V5 epitope. After checking of the nucleotide sequence of the vector region coding for the recombinant receptor, the construct was electroporated'into the murine 32Dcellline(ATCC)<br>
e)       Selection of stable cells over-expressing the EPO-Receptor.<br>
To select stable cells over-expressing the human EPO-Receptor, the 32D cell line electroporated with the construct encoding the EPO-Receptor was cultivated in the presence of 200 μg/ml of Zeocin (Invitrogen) for 5 weeks before its ability to proliferate in the presence of commercial human EPO (R&amp;D Systems) was assessed.<br>
Finally, the biological effect of mutated EPO and wild-type EPO is determined by two different tests: by evaluation of the ability of the different EPO proteins to induce cell proliferation of murine 32 cells over-expressing the EPO receptor and by measurement of the direct binding of mutated EPO and wild-type EPO to EPO receptor.<br>
0       Evaluation of the ability of wild-type and mutated G1Q4S EPO to induce cell<br>
proliferation of murine 32D cells over-cxprcssinR the EPO-Receptor.<br>
The ability of wild-type EPO and G104S mutated EPO to induce cell proliferation is assessed on murine 32D cells over-expressing the EPO-Receptor (32D-EPOR cells). This test was perfonned first on protein extracts containing the different EPO proteins produced in the previous steps, and, second, on purified EPO proteins obtained as previously described.<br>
The principle is that 32D-EPOR cells are inoculated in a 96-well plate at a cell density of 2.10 cells/well in a 200 ΜI final culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 32D-EPOR cells are incubated with serial dilutions of either wild-type or mutated EPO (from 0.024 to 140 ng/ml in the case of protein extracts and from 0.76x10 to 400 ng/ml in the case of purified EPO), at 37°C, for 5 days after which Uptiblue (Uptima) is added to the cultures. The rate of cell proliferation is quantified by measuring the fluorescence emitted at 590nm (excitation 560nm) after an additional period of incubation of .24 hours in the case of protein extracts and 4 hours in the case of purified EPO.<br>
The proliferative activity of the natural wild-type and the mutated EPO is based on the determination of the EC50 value corresponding to the EPO concentration (ng/ml) for which cell proliferation reaches 50%.<br>
First, two experiments such as described above have been carried out using the<br><br>
proteins extracts containing EPO, each experiment being repeated three times. The results of these experiments are represented in Figure 4A and Figure 4B, respectively. In Figure 4, for each protein concentration, the points correspond to the average of the three measures and the standard deviation represents the variation between the three repeats.<br>
The EC values obtained from these curves are the following:      in the first experiment: 24.22 ng/ml for the wild-type EPO and 4,68 ng/ml for the<br>
G104S mutated EPO<br>
in the second experiment: 5.24 ng/ml for the wild-type EPO and 3.7 ng/ml for the<br>
G104S mutated EPO<br>
Thus, Figures 4A and 4B and the EC50 values indicate that the G104S mutated EPO stimulating effect on cell proliferation of 32D cell lines over-expressing the human EPO-Receptor is 2 to 5 times higher than that of the natural wild-type EPO.<br>
Second, similar experiments have been carried out using purified EPO proteins. The results of two experiments, performed in triplicates, are represented in Figure 5 A and Figure 5B, respectively. In Figure 5, for each protein concentration, the points correspond to the average of the three measures and the standard deviation represents the variation between the three repeats.<br>
The EC50 values obtained from these curves are the following:<br>
in the first experiment: 2.38 ng/ml for the wild-type EPO and 0.58 ng/ml for the<br>
G104S mutated EPO<br>
in the second experiment: 2.57 ng/ml for the wild-type EPO and 1,12 ng/ml for the<br>
G104S mutated EPO.<br>
Thus, Figures 5A and 5B and the EC50 values indicate that the purified G104S mutated EPO stimulating effect on cell proliferation of 32D cell lines over-expressing the human EPO-Receptor is 2 to 5 times higher than that of the purified natural wild-type EPO, confirming the results obtained with the protein extracts.<br>
g)       Stimulation of erythroid colony formation by G104S mutated erythropoietin The  capacity  of G104S  mutated  erythropoietin  to  stimulate  erythroid .colony formation was evaluated and compared to that of wild-type erythropoietin.<br>
   To do so, human bone marrow cells from healthy individuals were collected and separated on a ficoll gradient. Nucleated cells (2.5x10 cells) were plated in semisolid methyl<br><br>
cellulose. Mutated or wild-type erythropoietin ranging from 0.25 to 10 ng/mL was then added to the culture medium. After 10 days of culture, erythroid colonies were counted.<br>
This experiment was performed twice and the average results .are collected in the following table arid represented in Figure 6.<br><br>
These data clearly demonstrate that G104S mutated erythropoietin stimulates erythroid colony formation. In particular, stimulation of erythroid colony formation by G104S mutated erythropoietin is 30 to 50% higher than that measured with wild-type erythropoietin.<br>
h)       Interaction between EPO and the EPO receptor<br>
The interaction between EPO and its receptor (EPO-R) was determined using Surface Plasmon Resonance technology (Biacore, SPR).<br>
To compare the affinities of G104S mutated EPO and wild-type EPO, quantitative measurements of the binding interaction between EPO and the extra-cellular part of the EPO-R are carried out using the EPO-R target ligand immobilized on a sensor chip surface and then passing, on the chip, different concentrations of an analyte consisting of the EPO proteins to be tested.<br>
The carboxymethylated dextran layer of the chip is designed to bind nickel to mediate the capture of ligands via metal chelation of a poly-histidine tail.<br>
For this reason, we designed an EPO-Receptor corresponding to the extra-cellular part<br>
of the mature human receptor (amino-acids 25-247) followed by a C-terminal V5 epitope and<br>
a    poly-histidine    tail    (KGFSFNWGGKPIPNPLLGLDSTGVDHHHHHH-C-ter).    The<br>
•    corresponding cDNA fragment was inserted into the Pichia pastoris vector pPICZalpha his-<br>
topo (Invitrogen) using the following specific oligonucleotides;<br>
SEQ ED NO. 21: Sense primer: GCGCCCCCGCCTAACCTC<br><br>
SEQ ID NO. 22: Antisense primer: GTCGCTAGGCGTCAGCAGCGA<br>
Two saturated pre-cultures of 50 ml of BMGY medium (2% Peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 1% Glycerol, 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.4 mg/Liter biolin pH 6.8) containing a clone coding for natural wild-type EPO or that coding for G104S EPO, were carried out for 24 hours at 30°C at an agitation of 200 rotations per minute (rpm).<br>
When the culture reaches a cellular density corresponding to an optical density of 5.0 measured at a wavelength of 600 nm, it is used to inoculate, at 1/5, 200 ml of BMMY medium (2% Peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 0.5% Methanol, 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.4 mg/L biotin pH 6.8).<br>
The expression of the protein is then induced by methanol at a final concentration of 0.5%, for 2 to 5 days at 30 °C; with an agitation of the culture flask at 200 rpm.<br>
The supernatant containing about 10 mg/ml of EPO-R is concentrated by ultrafiltration onto a labscale apparatus (cut-off 5000 Da) and buffer is exchanged by dialysis against sodium phosphate 50nxM, Tris(Cl) 10 mM, pH 8,0, NaCl 150 mM, imidazol 10 mM . Poly-histidine EPO-R is then captured onto a Hi-Trap pre-loaded with nickel-sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia). Fractions containing the protein were desalted using a~gel filtration column (buffer Tris(Cl) pH 9, NaCl 50 mM) and then purified at about 95% onto an anionic exchange chromatography. Purity and concentration were estimated using SDS-PAGE gels.<br>
The sensor chip NTA is then activated passing over nickel sulfate 500μM with a flow of 20μl/min. The EPO-R is then captured onto the surface at a concentration of 50 nM in a HBS-P buffer (10mM HEPES, NaCl 150 mM, 0,005% P20 EDTA 50 μM) with a flow of 10nl/min. Concentrations of wild-type EPO and G104S mutated EPO ranging from 0.45 to 15 nM were then passed over the sensor chip. A regeneration using HBS-P, EDTA 0,35M was performed after each concentration test. An automatic procedure permitted to evaluate the binding interaction of the wild-type EPO and G104S mutated EPO for the six concentrations in the range indicated above.<br>
Figure 7 shows the results of the binding measurements for two concentrations (7.5 and 15 nM) of G104S mutated EPO and wild-type EPO.<br>
These results indicate that the G104S mutated EPO binds more quickly to its receptor than the wild-type EPO, confirming the effect observed at the cellular level (see examples described in 3f and 3g ). As a consequence, this demonstrates that the strong positive effect of<br>
G104S mutated EPO on proliferation of murine 32D cells over-expressing the EPO receptor is related, at least in part, to a better affinity of G104S mutated EPO to its receptor.<br><br>
This effect on EPO potency of a mutation affecting the amino acid at position 104 in the immature EPO protein sequence is extremely surprising. Indeed, the crystal structure of EPO complexed to the EPO receptor indicates that only the three helices A, C, and D of EPO (out of the four helices A, B, C, and D) are involved in the binding with EPO receptor (Syed et al Efficiency of signaling through cytokine receptors depends critically on receptor orientation. Nature 395:511-516(1998)). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis analyzing the structure-function relationship in EPO demonstrates that changes in amino acids situated in helix B, in the neighborhood of residue 77, have no substantial effect on EPO, activity (Eliott er al. Mapping of the active site of recombinant human erythropoietin. Blood. 89: 493-502 (1997); Wen et al Erythropoietin structure-function relationships. Identification of functionally important domains. J. Biol. Chem. 269:22839-21846(1994)).<br>
Such novel information on structure/function of EPO could also be used to identify, design and develop new EPO-like entities (either chemical or peptidic) that mimic EPO activity on its human receptor.<br><br><br><br><br>
