				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of embossing rollers and embossing rollers manufactured thereby. The present invention particularly relates to a process for the manufacture of embossing rollers, which consists a pair of opposing steel embossing rollers and provides embossing rollers manufactured by the process of the present invention.<br>
The main usage of the present invention is for the development of embossing rollers, which are used for embossing on metal foil, metallized paper, paper or plastic sheets. Such embossing is used to stiffen the sheet. It increases the stiffness of the paper/foil thereby helps packing goods such as cigarettes in an automatic packing machine.<br>
Another particular usage of the present invention is in pharmaceutical industries. Tablets/capsules are placed between sheets of foil paper and embossed around the tablet/capsules. This helps to seal the pharmaceutical products from the atmosphere.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no. 5,007,271 and US patent no. 6,176,819, which is an improvement of US patent no. 5,007,271.<br>
US patent No. 5,007,271 describes a device and a method for embossing a metal foil, wherein a metal foil is passed between two similarly toothed rollers positioned so that the teeth of each roller engages the teeth of the other. A high-quality embossing is obtained which may be kept practically constant over long periods of operation. The rollers are mutually synchronized such that only one of these rollers need be coupled with a driving mechanism. The other roller is free and may easily be removed, replaced or adjusted in order to vary the force by which it is pressed against the foil and the driven roller respectively. This patent suggests that the axial grooves between adjacent rows of teeth may be machined by a slotting tool while the circumferential grooves may be machined by turning.<br>
US patent no. 6,176,819, describes a device and a method for embossing a foil, wherein the embossing process is effected between a pair of embossing rollers provided with toothings of the same kind which comprise rows of pyramidal teeth extending in the axial and the circumferential directions. Compared to the theoretical pyramid shape, the heads of the teeth are flattened while the edges of the pyramids are cut. The rollers, which are mutually displaceable in the axial direction, are thus able to catch in a stable mutual position of maximum penetration and to remain in this position in operation. In this patent edges of the pins are flattened by using etching process. Control of etching process is very much difficult for fine and deep structures especially at small pitch intervals.<br>
The drawbacks of the above patents are 1) producing burr in the machined pins and 2) profile error from pin to pin due to wear out of the formed cutters which were getting blunt. Such variations will not be easy to detect and correct in a milling or turning operation. These profile variations can affect the quality of embossing.<br>
Reference may be made to EP Patent No. 1245376, which describes a device for applying an embossing to a web of tissue paper and method thereof using one or more steel rollers in combination with rubber rollers. The rubber rollers have a yielding surface. A raised embossing pattern on the steel roller elastically presses into the rubber roller, so that the tissue paper fed between the rubber roller and the steel roller is imparted an embossing pattern into the sheet. The drawback of this method is uneven wear due to larger difference in the wear resistance of the matching rollers can affect the quality of embossing and also bring down the life of the rollers.<br>
Reference may be made to EP Patent No. 1155815 and CA Patent No.2347963, which describe an embossing roller has a relief pattern, defined on its surface for embossing onto multiple ply sheet material by compressing the material against another roller or similar surface.    In this method the relief pattern and the<br>
projections are provided by an etching process.  The drawbacks of this method are:<br>
1.	It is difficult to etch structures that are fine and deep, especially at small pitch intervals. For instance the pins in the embossing rollers, which is typically 100 µm wide and about 200 µm deep. This process is useful only for coarser patterns that are used in textile industry where accuracy is not needed.<br>
2.	The two rollers have large differences in wear properties. Hence there can be uneven wear leading to poor quality embossing with use.<br>
3.	Life will also be poor.<br>
The embossing normally has an array of pyramidal projections at regular pitch. Embossing operations are performed with plastic rollers or combinations of plastic and steel rollers or pair of steel rollers. As stated, the prior state of art on manufacturing of embossing rollers reflects several drawbacks. The Major challenge in the development of a process for the manufacture of embossing rollers is high precision profile generation and surface hardening without affecting the profile accuracy. Hence there is definite need for the improvement of a process for the manufacture of embossing rollers in order to get good quality embossing rollers and embossed products.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the manufacture of embossing rollers, which obviates the drawbacks of earlier methods.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cost effective method for the manufacture of embossing rollers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a smooth and burrs free surface profile for embossing rollers.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a dry process embossing without any lubricant for the embossing rollers.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a surface modification of the rollers so as to enhance the wear resistance of the roller.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide steel or steel rollers for the development of embossing rollers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of embossing rollers, which consists a pair of opposing steel embossing rollers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide embossing rollers manufactured by the process of the present invention.<br>
Fig.1 represents one of the two embossing roller profile details comprising Pitch(P), Angle (9), Depth (D) and Crest radius (C).<br>
Fig.2 represents the other of the two embossing roller profile details comprising Pitch(P), Angle(9), Depth (D) and Crest radius (C).<br>
Fig.3 depicts the both rollers assembled together in the machine frame for the embossing pattern of a profile wherein part No.1 is one of the two embossing rollers and part No.2 is the other of the two embossing rollers.<br>
