FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of pharmaceutical agents and specifically relates to compounds, compositions, uses and methods for treating cancer and angiogenesis-related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases represent a large family of proteins which play a central role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, maintaining control over cellular function. A partial list of such kinases includes abl, Atk, bcr-abl, BIk, Brk, Btk, c-kit, c-met, c-src, CDKI, CDK2, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDKIO, cRafl, CSFIR, CSK, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, Erk, Fak, fes, FGFRl, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, flt-l, Fps, Frk, Fyn, Hck, IGF-IR, INS-R, Jak, KDR, Lck, Lyn, MEK, p38, PDGFR, PIK, PK.C, PYK2, ros, tie, tie2, TRK, Yes, and Zap70. Inhibition of such kinases has become an important therapeutic target. Certain diseases are known to be associated with deregulated angiogenesis, for example ocular neovascularization, such as retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), age-related macular degeneration. psoriasis, hemangioblastoma. hemangioma, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disease, such as a rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory disease, especially arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or posl-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors and liquid tumors (such as leukemia).<br>
At the center of the network regulating the growth and differentiation of the vascular system and its components, both during embryonic development and normal growth, and in a wide number of pathological anomalies and diseases, lies the angiogenic factor known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor"(VEGF; originally termed 'Vascular Permeability Factor", VPF), along with its cellular receptors (see G. Breierelal., Trends in Cell Biology, 6, 454-6 {J996)).<br><br>
VEGF is a dimeric, disulfide-linked 46-kDa glycoprotein related to "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor" (PDGF); it is produced by nonnal cell lines and tumor cell lines; is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen; shows angiogenic activity in in vivo test systems (e.g. rabbit cornea); is chemotaclic for endothelial cells and monocytes; and induces plasminogen activators in endothelial cells, which are involved in the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix during the formation of capillaries. A number of i so forms of VEGF are known, which show comparable biological activity, but differ in the type of cells that secrete them and in their heparin-binding capacity. In addition, there are other members of the VEGF family, such as "Placenta Growth Factor"(PIGF) and VEGF-C.<br>
VEGF receptors (VEGFR) are transmembranous receptor tyrosine kinases. They are characterized by an extracellular domain with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Various types of VEGF receptor are known, e.g. VEGFR-I (also known as flt-l). VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR), and VEGFR-3.<br>
A large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells stimulates the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothelium in a paracrine manner and through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor grovrth. Increased VEGF expression could explain the occurrence of cerebral edema in patients with glioma. Direct evidence of the role of VEGF as a tumor angiogenesis factor in vivo is shown in studies in which VEGF expression or VEGF activity was inhibited. This was achieved with anti-VEGF antibodies, with dominant-negative VEGFR-2 mutants which inhibited signal transduction, and with antisense-VEGF RNA techniques. All approaches led to a reduction in the growth of glioma cell lines or other tumor cell lines in vivo as a result of inhibited tumor angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for tumors which grow beyond a diameter of about 1-2 mm; up to this limit, oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to the tumor cells by diffusion. Every tumor, regardless of its origin and its cause, is thus dependent on angiogenesis for its growth after it has reached a certain size.<br>
Three principal mechanisms play an important part in the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors against tumors: I) Inhibition of the growth of vessels, especially capillaries, into avascular resting tumors, with the result that there is no net tumor  growth  owing to  the  balance that  is achieved  between cell  death  and<br><br>
proliferation; 2) Prevention of the migration of tumor cells owing to the absence of blood flow to and from tumors; and 3) Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, thus avoiding the paracrine growth-stimulating effect exerted on the surrounding tissue by the endothelial cells which normally line the vessels. See R. Connell and J. Beebe, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11, 77-114 (2001).<br>
VEGF's are unique In that they are the only angiogenic growth factors known to contribute to vascular hyper permeability and the formation of edema. Indeed, vascular hyper permeability and edema that is associated with the expression or administration of many other growth factors appears to be mediated via VEGF production.<br>
Inflammatory cytokines stimulate VEGF production. Hypoxia results in a marked upregulation of VEGF in numerous tissues; hence situations involving infarct, occlusion, ischemia, anemia, or circulatory impairment typically invoke VEGF/VPF-mediated responses. Vascular hyper permeability, associated edema, altered Tran endothelial exchange and macromolecular extravasation, which is often accompanied by diapedesis, can result in excessive matrix deposition, aberrant stromal proliferation, fibrosis, etc. Hence, VEGF-mediated hyperpermeability can significantly contribute to disorders with these eliologic features. As such, regulators of angiogenesis have become an important therapeutic target.<br>

The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabili2er(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations, Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol<br><br>
diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl paJmilate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. AltemativeJy, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredients are dissolved or suspended in suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredients. The active ingredients are preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0,5 to 10% and particularly about 1.5% w/w.<br><br><br><br>
