				<td>1A FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rotary cutting tool for use in cutting operations having a feed directed along an axis of rotation of the cutting tool.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention particularly refers to rotary cutting tools designed for rough machining at high speeds and high removal rates such as used in manufacturing dies.<br>
A cutting tool of the above kind is disclosed, for example, in JP 06-3Q48Q6. The cutting tool is designed for deep plunging operations and comprises a cutting head formed with evacuation flutes extending from a front face thereof along a longitudinal axis of rotation of the tool, and a plurality of cutting inserts mounted at the front face of the cutting tool on body portions thereof disposed between the flutes. The cutting inserts are mounted so that their clamping screws are directed substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the cutting tool, and their operative cutting edges are disposed in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation and overlap so as to present a required number of effective cutting edges providing a pre-determined cutting radius.<br>
It is the purpose of the present invention to provide a rotary cutting tool for deep plunging operations, having a total number of outer cutting inserts greater than the number of inner cutting inserts, thus facilitating increased cutting efficiency at the peripheral region of the cutting tool.<br><br>
(1b)<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a rotary cutting tool with a longitudinal axis of rotation and pre-determined cutting radius, having a cutting head formed with at leas t two chip evacuation flutes and at least two body portions therebetween, which body portions bear, at a<br><br>
-2-<br>
front face of the cutting head, a plurality of cutting inserts mounted so that their operative cutting edges lie substantially in a plane perpendicular to said axis of rotation;<br>
a first body portion of said two body portions bearing a first outer cutting insert and a second body portion of said two body portions bearing a second outer cutting insert, the operative cutting edge of the second outer cutting insert being substantially shorter than the operative cutting edge of the first outer cutting insert and their outermost ends being substantially equidistant from said axis of rotation and being spaced therefrom at a distance defining said cutting radius of the cutting tool.<br>
Preferably, the second body portion bears additionally an inner cutting insert disposed closer to the said axis of rotation than the second outer cutting insert and spaced radially from said second outer cutting insert.<br>
Thus, the cutting tool according to the present invention is designed so that the number of the outer cutting inserts working at a periphery of the cutting tool is twice the number of the inner cutting inserts disposed closer to the axis of rotation, the additional outer cutting inserts being mounted on the same body portions of the cutting head as the inner cutting inserts and occupying minimal mounting space thereof due to their short cutting edges. The increased number of the effective outer cutting edges allows for the essential reduction of cutting forces acting on each of them at the periphery of the cutting tool where these forces are maximal, especially in cutting operations of the kind to which the present invention refers. The reduction of the cutting forces allows for the increase of the lifetime of the cutting inserts and also reduces vibrations of the cutting tool during deep cutting operations.<br>
Furthermore, in cutting operations where only peripheral cutting edges are operative, the increased number of effective peripheral cutting edges enables the cutting tool to cut at an increased feed rate, which is<br><br>
-3-<br>
particularly useful when the cutting tool is used for plunging operations in manufacturing dies, in particular when, after the main amount of material has been cut out by the plunger, undulated side walls of the cavities obtained thereby are to be flatterned .<br>
In addition, by virtue of the difference in length between the operative cutting edges of the first and second outer cutting inserts in the cutting tool of the present invention, the extent of overlapping between the inner and the first outer cutting inserts of the cutting tool may vary without any deterioration of its cutting efficiency at the periphery of the tool, whereby cutting tools of rather broad range of cutting radii may be provided.<br>
Preferably, each cutting insert of the cutting tool of the present invention has an insert clamping screw through bore and each insert receiving pocket in which the insert is mounted on the cutting head has a base surface formed with a pocket clamping screw threaded bore to be aligned with the insert clamping through bore. Preferably, the clamping screw through bores of the inner and the first outer cutting inserts are directed substantially co-directionally with the axis of rotation of the cutting tool, and the clamping screw through bore of the second outer cutting insert is directed substantially radially with respect to the axis of rotation of the cutting tool. To this end, the base surfaces of the insert receiving pockets of the inner and the first outer cutting inserts are substantially parallel to the plane in which the operative cutting edges of the cutting inserts lie, whilst the base surface of the insert receiving pocket of the second outer cutting insert is substantially perpendicular to this plane and also to the operative cutting edge of this insert.<br>
Preferably, the inner and the first and second outer cutting inserts are all identical and are of the kind having mutually perpendicular major and minor cutting edges, the inner and the first outer cutting inserts being mounted so as to present their major cutting edges in an operative<br><br>
-4-<br>
position, whilst the second outer cutting insert is mounted so as to present its minor cutting edge in an operative position.<br>
Preferably, the inner and the first and second outer cutting inserts are of the kind having a front cutting portion and a trailing mounting portion, the front cutting portion being formed with an operative front surface associated with mutually perpendicular major and minor cutting edges, and the trailing mounting portion having a clamping screw bore substantially perpendicular to said major cutting edge and co-directional with said minor cutting edge.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A rotary cutting tool 1 according to the present invention is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The cutting tool 1 comprises a cylindrical tool shank 2 having a longitudinal axis of rotation A and a cutting head 3, and a plurality of cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b and 7a, 7b mounted at a front face 8 of the cutting head 3 on its body portions 10a, 10b, 12a and 12b formed between four chip evacuation flutes 14. The cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b and 7a, 7b are mounted on the cutting head 3 by means of clamping screws 13.<br>
The cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b and 7a, 7b are indexable and<br>
are of an identical design. As shown in Fig. 2, each cutting insert has a front<br>
-cutting portion 15 with an operative front surface 16 associated with a pair of<br>
long major cutting edges 18 and a pair of short minor cutting edges 19, and a<br>
trailing mounting portion 20 formed with a clamping screw through bore 22<br>
for receiving therein the clamping screw 13.   The clamping screw through<br>
bore 22 extends generally co-directionally with the minor cutting edges 19.<br>
The geometry of the front cutting portion 15 of the cutting insert and the<br>
design of its trailing portion 20 are described in more detail in respective <br>
spending Israel Patent Applications Nos, 124,281 and 125,143 incorporated   <br>
herein by reference.	<br>
The insert receiving pockets 5a',' 5b', 6a', 6b' and 7a', 7b' in which the respective cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b and 7a, 7b are mounted, are specifically shown in Fig. 3. As seen, each of the insert receiving pockets has a base wall 20' formed with a clamping screw threaded bore 22' which is to be aligned with the clamping screw through bore 22 of the corresponding cutting insert for receiving therein the clamping screw 13.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3, the insert receiving pockets 5a', 5b', 6a', 6b' and 7a', 7b' are formed on different body portions 10a, 10b, 12a and 12b of the cutting head 3 and are oriented in different manners. In particular, the insert receiving pockets 5a', 5b' are formed on the respective body_ portions<br><br>
-6-<br>
10a, 10b and the insert receiving pockets 7a', 7b' are formed on the respective body portions 12a, 12b, all these pockets being oriented in such a manner that their respective base walls 20' are substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation A and their clamping screw threaded bores 22' are directed substantially parallel to this axis A. The insert receiving pockets 6a', 6b' are formed on the same body portions 12a, 12b as the insert receiving pockets 5a', however, their base walls 20' are oriented substantially parallel to the axis of rotation so that their clamping screw threaded bores 22' are directed substantially in a radial direction.<br>
With the arrangement as described above, the cutting inserts 5a, 5b and 7a, 7b are mounted in the respective insert receiving pockets 5a', 5b' and 7a', 7b' so as to present their major cutting edges 18 in an operative position, whilst the cutting inserts 6a, 6b are mounted in the insert receiving pockets 6a', 6b' so that their minor cutting edges 19 are operative. The operative cutting edges 18 of the cutting inserts 5a, 5b and 7a, 7b and the operative cutting edges 19 of the cutting inserts 6a, 6b lie in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation A of the cutting tool 1 and are directed substantially in the radial direction relative to this axis A.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3, the insert receiving pockets 5a', 5b' and 6a', 6b' are formed at the periphery of their respective body portions 10a, 10b and 12a, 12b and the insert receiving pockets 7a', 7b' are formed at the body portions 12a, 12b close to the axis of rotation A. For this reason, the cutting inserts 5a, 5b and 6a, 6b mounted in the respective insert receiving pockets 5a', 5b' and 6a' 6b' will be further referred to as first outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b and second outer cutting inserts 6a, 6b, and the cutting inserts 7a, 7b mounted in the insert receiving pockets 7a', 7b' will be further referred to as inner cutting inserts 7a, 7b.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic illustration of the mutual disposition of the operative cutting edges 18 of the cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 7a, 7b and the<br><br>
-7-<br>
operative cutting edges 19 of the cutting inserts 6a, 6b, when superimposed on a plane containing the axis of rotation A of the cutting tool 1.<br>
As seen in Fig. 4, the operative cutting edges 18 of the first outer cutting inserts 5a and 5b coincide so that their respective outermost ends 25a and 25b are equidistant from the axis of rotation A and are spaced therefrom at a distance R which defines a cutting radius of the cutting tool 1.<br>
The operative cutting edges 18 of the inner cutting inserts 7a and 7b are disposed so that the innermost end 37b of the cutting edge 18 of the cutting insert 7b reaches the axis A whilst the innermost end 37a of the cutting edge 18 of the cutting insert 7a is slightly aside therefrom. Consequently, the outermost end 27a of the cutting edge 18 of the cutting insert 7a is more remote from the axis A than the outermost end 27b of the cutting edge 18 of the cutting insert 7b.<br>
Furthermore, the inner cutting inserts 7a, 7b and the first outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b are disposed in such mutual relationship that their cutting edges partially overlap, since, as seen in Fig. 4, the outermost ends 27a, 27b of the respective inner cutting inserts 7a, 7b are located further from the axis A than the innermost ends 35a, 35b of the first outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b.<br>
As regards the second outer cutting inserts 6a, 6b, they are disposed in such a manner that the outermost ends 26a and 26b of their operative cutting edges 19 are equidistant from the axis A and coincide with the outermost ends 25a, 25b of the cutting edges 18 of the first outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b. Since the cutting edges 19 are shorter than the cutting edges 18, the innermost ends 36a, 36b of the cutting edges 19 of the cutting inserts 6a, 6b are disposed substantially further from the axis A than the innermost ends 35a, 35b of the cutting edges 18 of the cutting inserts 5a, 5b.<br>
Thus, by virtue of the difference in the lengths of the cutting edges 18 and 19 of the respective first and second outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b<br><br>
-8-<br>
and 6a, 6b, which difference is designated as D in Fig. 4, the overlap d between the cutting edges 18 of the first outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b and the inner cutting inserts 7a, 7b may vary, whereby cutting tools of different cutting radii may be provided.<br>
With the arrangement of the cutting inserts according to the present invention and, in particular, with the provision of the additional, second outer cutting inserts 6a, 6b, the total number of the outer cutting inserts 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b working at a periphery of the cutting tool is twice the number of the inner cutting inserts 7a, 7b disposed closer to the axis of rotation A. The increased number of effective outer cutting edges enables the cutting tool 1 to cut with an increased efficiency at its peripheral region.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates one possible application of the cutting tool according to the present invention. Fig. 5 shows a workpiece W which has undergone a series of overlapping plunging operations by the cutting tool described above in which all the cutting inserts were operative and during which the interior volume of the workpiece has been removed leaving wavy side walls S. The waviness of the side walls can now be significantly reduced by another series of plunging operations therealong where only peripheral cutting inserts of the cutting tool will be operative.<br>
The cutting tool of the present invention may have alternative designs not described above and not shown in the drawings. Thus, for example, the cutting tool may have a different number of chip evacuation flutes and a different number of cutting inserts mounted therein. The cutting inserts used in the cutting tool do not necessarily need to be identical and they may have different sizes and different lengths of their operative cutting edges. The cutting inserts may have any appropriate shapes, including any appropriate design of their front and trailing portions.<br><br>
