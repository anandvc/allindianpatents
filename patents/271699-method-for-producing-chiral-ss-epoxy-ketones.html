				<td>Method for producing chiral α,ß-epoxy ketones<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing chiral α,ß-epoxy ketones.<br>
Functionalized epoxides are very useful intermediates in the synthesis of industrially relevant compounds.<br>
Possible routes to enantiomerically pure α,ß-epoxy ketones include asymmetric epoxidations of the corresponding α,ß-unsaturated ketones.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
A series of examples of this type of reaction have been described in the literature. They include numerous examples of the enantioselective epoxidation of chalcone and chalcone derivatives. (Chem. Commun.) Highly enantioselective epoxidations of cyclic α,ß-unsaturated ketones, however, are unknown. Neither with the aid of chiral reagents employed stoichiometrically, nor using chiral catalysts, has it been possible to achieve anything more than unsatisfactory enantioselectivities. Furthermore, there is no general method available for the highly enantioselective epoxidation of aliphatic α,ß-unsaturated ketones.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide a simple process for preparing enantiomerically enriched cyclic α,ß-epoxy ketones.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the enantioselective epoxidation of α,ß-unsaturated ketones, in which a compound of the general formula I,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which<br>
R1 is a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, which may have suitable substituents and may have one or more heteroatoms in the chain,<br>
R2 is hydrogen, a branched or unbranched, .saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, which may have suitable substituents and may have one or <br>
more heteroatoms in the chain, or an aryl group or heteroaryl group, which may have suitable substituents,<br>
R3 is hydrogen, a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, which may have suitable substituents and may have one or more heteroatoms in the chain, or an aryl group or heteroaryl group, which may have suitable substituents,<br>

and the radical R1 may, with the radicals R2 and R3, form a ring, which may have 5 to 20 members, be saturated or unsaturated, alicyclic or heteroalicyclic, and may have suitable substituents,<br>
is reacted with an oxidizing agent to form α,ß-epoxy ketones of the general formula II,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1, R2, R3 are as defined above.<br>
It has been found that α,ß-epoxy ketones of the general formula II are obtained in good yields and outstanding enantioselectivities from α,ß-unsaturated ketones of the general formula I by epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a chiral catalyst, such as amino compounds and their acid addition salts.<br>
The process of the invention is implemented by reacting α,ß-unsaturated ketones of the general formula I with a suitable oxidizing agent in the presence of a chiral catalyst. Any catalyst can be used that supports the reaction between the α,ß-unsaturated ketone and the oxidizing agent. Organic bases, more particularly amines and their acid addition salts, have proven particularly suitable. The addition salts can be used per se or may form in the course of the reaction. Preferred amines have a structure of the general formula III,<br>

Preference is given to amines having the formula III, in which the radical R4 has an additional basic functionality, such as an amino group.<br>
The chiral catalyst is preferably selected from chiral amines of the general formula III, from addition salts of achiral amines of the general formula III with chiral acids, and from addition salts of chiral amines of the general formula III with achiral or chiral acids.<br>

Examples of suitable chiral acids are chiral organic phosphoric acids, phosphorimides, sulfuric acids, sulfonic acids, sulfonylimides, carboxylic acids, imides, etc. The chiral acids are preferably derived from binaphthol. In one possible embodiment, the chiral acid is selected from organic chiral phosphoric acids having the general formula IV,<br>

formula removed<br>
The catalyst salts A-C were prepared in situ in dioxane (2-4 ml) from the amine (10 mol%) and the respective acid (10-20 mol%). After 20 minutes of stirring the α,ß-unsaturated ketones were added, and after a further 20 minutes, 1.5 equivalents of an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (50% w/w) were added. After a reaction time of 20-72 h at 30-50°C, the reaction mixture was cooled and water added. This was followed by extraction with ether, after which the combined organic phases were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, to give the crude products which were purified by chromatography (SiO2, ether/pentane). In the case of the acyclic a,(3-unsaturated ketone, the crude product obtained in this way was stirred optionally for 10 minutes to 1 hour in ether with one equivalent of 1 N NaOH solution. Thereafter the ether phase was washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. This was followed by purification by chromatography (SiO2, ether/pentane).<br>
With catalyst A: 1.0 mmol scale based on the α,ß-unsaturated ketone. The catalyst salt A was prepared from 9-amino-9-deoxyepiquinine (8.1 mg, 0.1 mmol, 10mol%) and TFA (15.3 pi, 0.2 mmol, 20 mol%).<br>
With catalyst B: 0.5 mmol scale based on the α,ß-unsaturated ketone. The catalyst salt B was prepared from (R,R)-DPEN (10.6 mg, 0.05 mmol, 10 mol%) and S-TRIP (37.6 mg, 0.05 mmol, 10 mol%).<br>
With catalyst C: 1.0 mmol scale based on the α,ß-unsaturated ketone. The catalyst salt C was prepared from 9-amino-9-deoxyepiquinidine (8.1 mg, 0.1 mmol, 10 mol%) and TFA (15.3 µl, 0.2 mmol, 20 mol%).<br>
