DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-4, a preferred embodiment of a cycle computer assembly 10 is shown. Computer 10 generally includes casing 12, switch 14, flip 16 and magnet 18.<br>
It will be appreciated that terms such as "front", "back" and "side" used hereinbelow are merely for ease of description and refer to the orientation of the components as<br><br>
shown in the Figures. It should be understood that any orientation of assembly 10 and the components thereof described herein is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
For exemplary purposes only, described hereinbelow are preferred embodiments wherein assembly 10 is provided for use with a bicycle. As shown in FIG. 1, the assembly 10 is mounted on the handlebars 100 of the bicycle. As discussed above, it will be understood, that the use of the assembly with a bicycle, or any cycle for that matter, is not a limitation on the present invention. For example, assembly 10 can be used   with   lap   top   computers,   all   terrain   vehicles,   go-karts   and   the   like.<br>
Casing 12 includes a front wall 20, back wall 22 and a plurality of side walls 24 that cooperate to surround a casing interior 26. The casing interior 26 houses the central processing unit (CPU) 28. Preferably, the front wall 20 of the casing 12 includes a screen 20a or the like for displaying information generated by the CPU 28. Casing 12 is preferably comprised of a plastic such as nylon or a phenolic or other synthetic resin. However, casing 12 can be comprised of any material that does not interfere with   the   magnetic   effect   exerted   by   the   magnet   18   on   the   switch   14.<br>
The switch 14 and magnet 18 are mounted in close proximity to each other. Switch 14 is mounted in the casing interior 26 and magnet 18 is attached to the flip 16. Switch 14 is a magnetically actuated switch and is located adjacent one of the side walls 24, and is   preferably   attached   to   the   side   wall   24   by   glue   or   other   adhesive.<br>
Switch 14 can be any electro-magnetic switch known in the art, such as a reed-type<br><br>
switch. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the switch elements of a reed switch change state when the reed switch is exposed to a magnetic field, as is necessary for operation of the present invention. Switch 14 can be configured to be normally closed or normally open. Preferably, switch 14 is normally in an open position. Open position is used herein to mean that when the switch is not affected by a magnet the switch is held open, such that the computer is off (i.e., the circuit is open). FIG. 4a illustrates schematically the normally open position. As shown, magnet 18 far enough from switch 14 so that the magnetic field produced by magnet 18 is not affecting switch 14. Accordingly, switch 14 is held open. In FIG. 4b , the magnet 18 is close enough to switch 14 for the magnetic field produced by the magnet 18 to close the switch 14.<br>
The casing 12 includes opposing members 30 that each have axially aligned openings 32 defined therein for receiving a hinge pin 34. Flip 16 has an opening 16 defined therein for receiving hinge pin 34. In a preferred embodiment, flip 16 has a spring recess 16a therein for receiving a spring 36 that is disposed on the hinge pin 34, as shown in FIG. 2. Spring 36 biases flip 16 in a predetermined position (referred to herein as off position). In off position, a gap 38 is defined between magnet 18 and switch 14. Gap 38 is wide enough so that magnet 18 does not activate or close the switch. It will be understood that the dimensions of gap 38 are dependent on the sensitivity of switch 14 and the strength of magnet 18. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that magnet 18 and switch 14 can be configured for maximum sensitivity as desired.<br><br>
Because switch 14 is disposed inside the casing 12, practically no moisture can get inside to affect the switch 14, the CPU 28 or the components thereof.<br>
Switch 14 has a pair of lead wires 40 that extend therefrom to the CPU 28. Therefore, when the switch is closed, and the circuit is subsequently closed, the CPU is energized. When the switch is opened, the CPU is shut off.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3-4b, in operation, as mentioned above, switch 14 is normally open. Flip 16 is normally biased by spring 36 in off position. At this point, the computer is off. When magnet 18 is in this position, the magnetic field produced by magnet 18 is not strong enough to close switch 14 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4a. To turn the computer on, the flip 16 is pressed inwardly, such that it pivots about hinge pin 34. Flip 16 is then held in the position shown in FIG. 4 (referred to herein as on position). As can be seen in FIGS. 4 and 4b, in the on positions the magnet 18 is in closer proximity to switch 14 and the switch 14 is closed, thereby turning on the computer.<br>
In another embodiment, the position of the flip 16 shown in FIG. 3 may be the on position where the switch is closed and the computer is on. In this embodiment, to place the flip in an off position, the flip 16 is pulled upwardly so that it is substantially parallel to the front wall 20 of the casing. It will be understood that those skilled in the art will be able to make numerous modifications to the orientation of the switch, the magnet and the flip. All such modifications are within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
It will be understood that the device is not limited to activation by a magnetic field generating device. Any field, beam or the like that can affect the state of the switch is within the scope of the present invention. For example, a light beam emitting device and appropriate receptor can be used. Sound waves, such as ultrasonic waves produced by a magnetostrictive element can be used.<br>
FIG. 5 shows another embodiment 40 of the present invention. In this embodiment, the casing 12 and the flip 16 are molded out of a resilient material as a single unit. The flip 16 is connected to the casing 12 by a thin strip of resilient hingeable material<br>
FIG. 6 shown yet another embodiment 60 of the present invention. In this embodiment, the magnet 18 is secured to the backside of a button 62. The casing 12 includes a spring housing 64 extending from a side wall 24 thereof. The spring housing surrounds a spring 66 that biases the button 62 outwardly so that the magnet 18 is held away from switch 14 to allow switch 14 to remain in an open state. To turn the computer on, the button 62 is pressed inwardly so that the magnetic field produced by the magnet 18 causes the switch to activate the CPU.<br>
The general concept of the invention is a switch disposed inside a casing so that it is weatherproof, wherein the switch is affected by a field, such as a magnetic field, instead of requiring direct manual activation. Preferably, the magnet is movably associated with the outside of the casing so that it can be disposed in at least two positions; one where the magnetic field produced by the magnet affects the switch, and one where it does not. Movably associated with the outside of the casing means that the magnet 18 is outside of the casing 12 and is somehow secured to the casing 12<br><br>
(whether by flip, button, hinge, etc.) and is capable of moving relative to the casing 12.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention recited herein are intended to be merely exemplary and those skilled in the art will be able to make numerous modifications to them without departing from the spirit of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims appended hereto.<br><br><br><br><br>
