				<td>BRUSH APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a brush apparatus used for, for example, an engine starter.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, in order to achieve high-power and high-current in a direct current electric motor (DC electric motor) such as an engine starter, reduction of an internal electric resistance and upsizing of the electric motor are effective. As a measure for reducing the internal electric resistance, it is considered to increase a cross-sectional area of a conductor of a pigtail for the purpose of reduction of a current density and voltage drop of a lead wire which constitutes the pigtail. In order to do so, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the lead wire or to connect a plurality of the lead wires to a brush disclosed, for example, in JP-A-11-178285 and JP-A-2003-79093.<br>
In order to increase the cross-sectional area of the conductor of the pigtail without changing the brush size for achieving the high-power and high-current of the DC electric motor in the related art, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the lead wire which constitutes the pigtail or to use a plurality of the lead wires.  However, when the<br><br>
thickness of the lead wire increases, the finished outer diameter of the pigtail increases accordingly, and the dimensions of permissible wear from a surface of the brush, which comes into sliding contact with a commutator, to the lower end of a embedded portion of the pigtail decreases, which shortens the life of the brush. In addition, when the wear of the brush advances, the brush passes toward the commutator by a brush spring and hence moves downward in a brush holding member. However, the pigtail employing a thick lead wire has poor flexibility, which hinders the downward movement of the brush and causes a contact failure between the brush and the commutator, which may result in the voltage drop.<br>
On the other hand, when two lead wires are embedded in the brush as shown in Fig. 4B in JP-A-2003-79093, since the positions where the two lead wires are embedded are different, the shape of a brush holder is constrained and hence a holding contact surface with respect to the brush decreases, which may result in lowering of the strength of the holding member and lowering of the holding stability. As shown in Patent Document JP-A-11-178285, when the lead wire is embedded on the opposite side of the surface which comes in sliding contact with the commutator, the brush is reliably held by the brush holder. Instead, however, there arises a necessity to avoid interference of the pigtail with respect to a bracket or the like on the outer periphery of the brush. Therefore, reduction<br><br>
of the brush height is necessary, and hence shortening of the<br>
brush life against the wear is unavoidable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to solve the above-described problems.<br>
A brush apparatus according to the invention includes a brush having a rectangular solid shape and coming into sliding contact with a commutator connected to an armature coil, and a brush holder that holds the brush. The brush includes a pigtail having a plurality of lead wires tightly bonded into a flat shape. The pigtail is embedded in the brush at a substantially widthwise center of a wider side thereof, which is orthogonal to a surface of the brush which comes into contact with the commutator in such a manner that the longitudinal side in cross-section of the pigtail extends in parallel with the surface of the brush which comes into contact with the commutator. The brush holder includes a brush holding member for storing the brush, a brush spring for pressing a surface of the brush opposite from the surface which comes into contact with the commutator against the commutator in order to bring the brush into sliding contact with the commutator, a base for holding the brush holding member and electrically connecting the same to an earth circuit, and a connection lug provided on the base.  The brush holding member has a notch formed on<br><br>
a wider side thereof fc&gt;y trimming away the brush holding member from an upper end thereof for allowing a downward movement of the pigtail when the brush wears and hence is pressed downward. A distal end of the pigtail is connected to the connection lug.<br>
This arrangement enables to elongate the life of the brush, and to store the brush stably in the brush holder. Since the flexibility of the pigtail is sufficiently secured, the pigtail is prevented from hindering the contact between the brush and the commutator, which improves electrical performance. In addition, the pigtail may be formed of a general-purpose member, and may be connected to the brush holding member easily, so that cost reduction is expected.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a brush<br>
apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view illustrating a brush<br>
according to the embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view illustrating the brush<br>
according to the embodiment.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating part of a brush apparatus of an engine starter according to an embodiment of the invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective view illustrating a brush without an insulation tube according to the embodiment of the invention; and Fig. 3 is a perspective view illustrating the brush with the insulation tube according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, the brush apparatus in the invention includes a brush holder 4 and a brush 1. The brush holder 4 includes a brush holding member 5 having a tubular space formed into a rectangular shape in cross section when viewed from the top. One of narrower sides of the brush holding member 5 is fixed to a base 7. The brush 1 having a pigtail 2, described later, is inserted into the brush holding member 5, and the lower end of the brush 1 is in sliding contact with a commutator 8. A brush spring 6 formed by winding a thin plate, which applies an adequate contact pressure to the commutator 8 by pressing the brush 1 from above, is attached to one of wider sides of the brush holding member 5. The brush holding member 5 is provided with a notch 5a at a substantially center of the other wider side thereof by trimming away from the upper end of the brush holding member 5, thereby allowing a downward movement of the pigtail 2 provided on the brush 1 when the brush 1 wears and hence is pressed downward by the brush spring 6 .  The distal<br><br>
end of the pigtail 2 is connected to a connection lug 7a formed integrally with the base 7 by welding or the like.<br>
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are perspective views illustrating the brush 1, respectively. The pigtail 2 is embedded in one of the wider sides of the brush 1 which is formed substantially into a rectangular solid shape. The pigtail 2 includes two lead wires 21 tightly bonded to each other. The pigtail 2 is embedded in the brush 1 in such a manner that the longitudinal direction of the cross-section thereof extends in parallel with a surface of the brush 1 which comes into contact with the commutator. When the pigtail 2 is composed of thtee or more lead wires, the three or more lead wires are tightly bonded to each other into a flat shape. Assuming that "a" designates a longitudinal width of a cross-section of the pigtail 2 and "c" designates the width of the brush 1 having the pigtail 2 embedded therein, the value "a" is set to be 50% or lower of the value "c". The reason is that when the value "a" exceeds 50% of the value "c", the width of the notch 5a to be provided on the brush holding member 5 increases and hence the side surface of the brush holding member 5 which surrounds the brush, that is, the surface areas on both sides of the notch 5a decrease. Consequently, it becomes difficult to stably hold the brush 1 and also it becomes difficult to maintain the strength of the brush holding member 5 by minimizing the width of the notch 5a.<br><br>
The lead wire 21 is formed of a flexible strand wire. Assuming that reference sign "b" designates the diameter thereof, the cross-section of the pigtail 2 has a substantially elongated circle having a width of "a" (=2b) and a height of "b" . In this configuration, the pigtail dimension "b" in the direction of the wear of the brush may be restrained with respect to increase in cross-sectional area of the conductor of the pigtail, which is effective for extending the permissible wear of the brush and elongating the brush life. In addition, since a generally available lead wire having a circular cross section can be used as the lead wire 21, the parts for the pigtail is easy to obtain, so that cost reduction is effectively achieved. Furthermore, since the dimension "b" in the direction of wear of the brush is relatively small with respect to the cross-sectional area of the conductor of the pigtail, flexibility of the pigtail 2 in the direction of wear of the brush 1 is larger than a pigtail having the same cross-sectional area but being formed of a single thick lead wire. Therefore, the probability of application of a stress which causes a contact failure between the brush and the commutator by the rigidity of the pigtail is reduced, which alleviates the risk of occurrence of the voltage drop between the brush and the commutator.<br>
An end of the pigtail 2 where the respective lead wires 21 are embedded into the brush 1 is positioned near the upper<br><br>
end of the brush 1 at the center on the wider side of the brush 1 leaving a thickness "d" of the brush 1 which is capable of securing the embedding strength. Accordingly, elongation of the life of the brush 1 against wear is achieved.<br>
When the pigtail 2 needs to be insulated from the periphery thereof, it is achieved by covering the two lead wires 21 together with one insulation tube 3 as shown in Fig. 3. Fixation of the distal end of the pigtail 2 is achieved by welding or brazing the two lead wires 21 to the connection lug 7a of the base 7 which fixes the brush holding member 5 as described above. Since the lead wires 21 are tightly bonded to each other, the welding or the brazing of the two lead wires 21 are achieved by one operation, which helps to reduce a man-hour.<br>
Subsequently, the operation will be described. A power is distributed to the interior of the engine starter from an external power source (not shown) and a current is distributed from an armature coil (not shown) to the commutator 8 through an electric circuit. The current is then distributed to the brush 1 which is pressed by the brush spring 6 and is in sliding contact with the commutator 8, then flows from the brush 1 through the pigtail 2 and then to the base 7 through the connection lug 7a to which the pigtail 2 is welded. Then the current returns back to the external power source through an external terminal of an engine starter, which is connected to<br><br>
the base 7 (not shown) so as to be capable of distributing electricity. At the same time, the armature (not shown) generates a rotational torque and the commutator 8 rotates integrally therewith. Therefore, the brush 1, which is in sliding contact therewith, wears gradually, and is pressed more against the commutator 8 by the brush spring 6. As a result the pigtail 2 moves in the notch 5a toward the commutator 8. Since the brush spring 6 also moves in the same manner toward the commutator 8, a notch (not shown) which allows downward movement of the brush spring is also provided on an opposed side of the notch 5a.<br>
According to the brush apparatus in the configuration as described above, the influences of the cross-sectional shape and the embedded position of the pigtail on the brush life are restrained to achieve an elongated life of the brush, and increase in total cross-sectional area of the pigtail is achieved while securing sufficient flexibility of the pigtail. Also, the strength of the brush holding member and the stability of holding of the brush are secured. Furthermore, the brush apparatus is easily manufactured because the plurality of lead wires are welded at one time, and only one insulation tube is necessary. Also, increase in number of components is restrained, which contributes to cost reduction.<br>
Various modifications and alterations of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing<br><br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention, and it should be understood that this is not limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.<br><br><br>
