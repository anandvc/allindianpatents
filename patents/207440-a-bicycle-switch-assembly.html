BICYCLE CONTROL DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to bicycle control devices, and more particularly to an electric switch used to operate a bicycle computer, wherein the electrical switch is mounted in a recess defined in the bicycle control device.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Modern bicycles allow the rider to control the gears, the brakes and other features of the bicycle to optimize the rider' s experience. Much of the control functions are computerized so that a rider can control the particular function by simply pressing a switch. The switch is usually provided on a computerized control panel of a bicycle. A typical computerized control panel includes a base member mounted to the bicycle handlebar and numerous switches on the control panel, each switch corresponding to a particular function that is controllable by the rider.<br>
During a ride, it is important that the rider be able to conveniently access the control switch associated with a particular function. Moreover, to retain control of the bicycle, it is desirable to provide a switch wherein the switch can be activated by the rider while allowing the rider to, simultaneously, retain a grip on the bicycle handlebar. However, while it is desirable to provide the switch close to the grip, it is not necessarily convenient<br><br>
to have the computerized control panel positioned near the grip for several reasons. First, it is visually more desirable to have the control panel centered in front of the bicycle rider during a ride. Second, a computerized bicycle may already have numerous devices, such as the brake control device and shifter, already attached to the handlebar near the grip. Accordingly, there may be little room for an additional computerized control panel.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a control switch that is close to the grip of the handlebar so as to be easily accessible to a bicycle rider during a ride without requiring the rider to remove his or her grip from the handlebar in order to access the control switch.<br>
It is also desirable to provide a control switch that is remote from the cycle computer such that the computer can be installed in a location that is easily viewable by the bicycle rider.<br>
Furthermore, it is desirable to provide a simple and inexpensive method of installing the control switch.<br>
Summary of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A bicycle control device having a switch mounting recess therein is disclosed. The bicycle control device could be a shifter, a brake control mechanism or an integrated shifting and brake control device. A control switch of a cycle computer is mountable in the switch mounting recess. The control switch is connected to a cycle computer, located remote from the control switch, by a connecting cable. The control switch can be attached in the switch mounting recess by various means, including, adhesively connecting the control switch to the switch mounting recess.   In one embodiment of the invention,  the<br><br>
control switch is press fitted into the switch mounting recess. In another embodiment, an elastic portion of the control switch is press fitted into a hole in the switch mounting recess. The control switch can also be securely retained in the switch mounting recess by a retention ring attached to the control device.<br>
