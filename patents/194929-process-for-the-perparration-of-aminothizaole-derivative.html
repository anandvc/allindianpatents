US patent No. 4,416,880 discloses a process for the preparation of l-{2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-l-propenecarboxyIic acid which involves chromatographic separation and the process suffers from very low yield. The process comprises reacting ethyl-4-haloacetoacetate with aldehyde, followed by cyclization with thiourea and  subsequent  alkali  hydrolysis  resulting  in  a  highly  impure<br><br>
compound because of the free amino group. The reaction is shown in scheme 1<br><br>

ii)       cyclizing the compound of formula (XIV) with mono acetyl thiourea in<br>
the presence of a solvent at a temperature in the range of 0 to 90°C to produce<br>
thiazole compound of formula (XV) wherein R1 is as defined above,<br>
iii)      de-esterifying the compound of formula (XV) in the presence of a base<br>
and water at room temperature to yield compound of formula (XVI) and<br>
iv)      deacylating the compound of formula (XVI) in the presence of a base<br>
and water at a temperature in the range of 0 to 75 °C to produce compound of<br>
formula (I).<br>
