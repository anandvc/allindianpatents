				<td>HIGH-VOLTAGE VEHICLE FAULT DETECTION METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for detecting a<br>
fault condition aboard a vehicle having at least one contactor or relay that is operable for<br>
isolating or containing high voltage within an energy storage system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	In a high-voltage propelled vehicle (HVPV), such as a hybrid-electric<br>
vehicle (HEV), a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), a fuel cell electric vehicle<br>
(FCEV), or a purely electric vehicle (EV), an energy storage system (ESS), for example a<br>
battery pack, can provide a source of at least a portion of the power necessary for<br>
propelling the vehicle. The engine or fuel cell can shut off or power down when the<br>
vehicle is idling or at a standstill in order to further conserve fuel, depending on the<br>
particular design of the vehicle. The ESS itself contains or stores relatively high voltage,<br>
which is transmitted to one or more vehicle devices, such as one or more<br>
motor/generators, via a specially configured high-voltage bus having a positive and a<br>
negative conductor or "rail". The ESS in turn is isolated from the various vehicle<br>
conductive structures and surfaces, and from the vehicle chassis itself, in part by<br>
selectively opening one or more electrical relays or contactors under certain operating<br>
conditions, such as during vehicle shutdown and/or under certain fault conditions, by<br>
opening one or more contactors.<br>
[0003]	Electrical contactors or relays serve to confine high voltage within the<br>
ESS during the vehicle shutdown process, as well as during certain fault conditions.<br>
Contactors helps to ensure that power to the load is shut off or interrupted when the<br>
contactors are de-energized. Contactors also help ensure that the high-voltage energy is<br>
transmitted to a load, such as a motor/generator, only when the contactor is properly<br>
energized or closed. However, under certain fault conditions the leads of one or more of<br>
the contactors may weld together, thus potentially rendering the contactor ineffective for<br>
its intended purpose. Therefore, the detection or diagnosis of such a welded contactor<br><br>
condition can be desirable, in particular for certain preventive or corrective maintenance<br>
purposes.<br>
[0004]	A normally-open contactor can help to ensure that electrical power to the<br>
load is shut off or interrupted when the contactor is de-energized, and that the high-<br>
voltage is transmitted to a load, such as the motor/generator, only when the contactor is<br>
properly energized or closed. However, under certain fault conditions the leads or<br>
contacts of one or more of the contactors can physically weld together, which in turn<br>
might affect the controllability of the flow of power from the ESS. While the presence of<br>
both welded contactors in a two-rail relay can be detected using diagnostics provided by a<br>
vehicle's control system, such diagnostics measure a drop in voltage when the contactors<br>
are opened, and require that other control modules to be active and communicating with<br>
the ESS for a predetermined period of time after the contactors are opened. Additionally,<br>
such voltage drop methods cannot detect the presence of a single welded contactor in a<br>
two-rail relay, particularly on the negative rail of a high-voltage bus.  Other fault<br>
conditions, such as disconnected high-voltage vehicle components, are generally detected<br>
using communications intensive messaging processes that may be less than optimal for<br>
certain purposes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	Accordingly, a method is provided for detecting a high-voltage fault<br>
condition aboard a vehicle having a chassis, electrical isolation or impedance<br>
measurement circuitry, a pair of relays or contactors, an energy storage system (ESS),<br>
and a high-voltage bus. The method includes measuring an electrical impedance value<br>
between the high-voltage bus and the vehicle chassis, and determining whether a vehicle<br>
fault condition is present, as well as identifying the particular fault condition, depending<br>
on the value of the impedance measurement under different states or conditions of the<br>
contactor.<br>
[0006]	The method includes measuring a first total impedance level between the<br>
high-voltage bus and the chassis when the contactors are each in a closed state, and<br>
opening the pair of contactors before measuring a second total impedance level. The<br>
method then includes comparing the first and second total impedance levels, and<br><br>
executing a maintenance response aboard the vehicle in response to the measured<br>
impedance levels. Executing the maintenance response includes setting an error code in a<br>
controller corresponding to the fault condition when the second total impedance level is<br>
less than a threshold multiple of the first total impedance level.<br>
[0007]	The threshold multiple is a value selected from a predetermined range,<br>
which in one embodiment is approximately 4 to 6. The method includes comparing the<br>
first total impedance level to the second total impedance level by accessing a look-up<br>
table to determine the fault state, with the look-up table being indexed in part by a<br>
predetermined low range and a predetermined normal range of total impedance values for<br>
each of the closed state and the open state. The predetermined normal range of total<br>
impedance values corresponding to the closed state is approximately 0.800 to 1.50 mega<br>
ohms (MΩ) in one embodiment, and the predetermined normal range of total impedance<br>
values corresponding to the open state is approximately 3 to 5 MΩ.<br>
[0008]	Accessing the look-up table to determine the fault state or condition<br>
includes, in one embodiment, accessing a first portion of the look-up table to determine<br>
an ESS isolation fault, accessing a second portion of the look-up table to determine a<br>
welded contactor condition, accessing a third portion of the look-up table to determine a<br>
vehicle isolation fault, accessing a fourth portion of the look-up table to determine a no-<br>
fault condition, and accessing a fifth part of the look-up table to determine a disconnected<br>
high-voltage component condition.<br>
[0009]	A method of the present invention also includes diagnosing a high-voltage<br>
fault condition, such as a welded contactor, ESS isolation fault, and/or a disconnected<br>
high-voltage component, in a vehicle having a chassis, a pair of contactors, an energy<br>
storage system (ESS), and a high-voltage bus. The method includes measuring a first<br>
total impedance level between the chassis and the high-voltage bus while the vehicle is<br>
running, then commanding a shut-down of the vehicle before measuring a second total<br>
impedance level at the same location after the shut-down. The method then includes the<br>
comparison of the second total impedance level to the first total impedance level, and the<br>
setting of an error code or a data code aboard the vehicle corresponding to the fault<br>
condition when a ratio of the second total impedance level to the first total impedance<br>
level is less than a threshold ratio.<br><br>
[0010]	A vehicle is also provided having a chassis, an energy storage system<br>
(ESS), a motor/generator, and a high-voltage bus having a positive rail and a negative<br>
rail. The high-voltage bus conducts electrical current from the ESS to the<br>
motor/generator. The vehicle also includes a first contactor between the ESS and the at<br>
least one motor/generator along the positive rail of the high-voltage bus, a second<br>
contactor between the ESS and the at least one motor/generator on the negative rail, and a<br>
measurement circuit or device for measuring a total impedance level between the chassis<br>
and each of the positive and negative rails. A controller is in electrical communication<br>
with the measurement device, and has an algorithm for determining a high-voltage fault<br>
condition based on the total impedance level.<br>
[0011]	In another aspect of the invention, at least one of the first and the second<br>
contactors is configured as either a single-pole, single-throw relay device or as a solid-<br>
state switch.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, and beginning with Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes a controller 22 having a<br>
method or algorithm 100 for detecting a high-voltage vehicle fault condition, such as a<br><br>
welded contactor or contactors, a vehicle isolation fault, and/or a disconnected high-<br>
voltage component, as will be described below with reference to Figure 3. The vehicle<br>
10 as shown in Figure 1 also includes an engine 12 that is selectively connectable to a<br>
transmission 19 for powering the vehicle. However, other power sources may also be<br>
used to propel the vehicle 10 within the scope of the invention, such as a fuel cell (not<br>
shown), or the vehicle 10 may be propelled exclusively via an electrical storage system<br>
(ESS) 11 if the vehicle 10 is configured as an electric vehicle. In the embodiment of<br>
Figure 1, the transmission 19 includes one or more motor/generators 18 (M/G A) and one<br>
or more gear sets 16, such as simple or compound planetary gear sets, which are<br>
drivingly connected to a final drive assembly 24. The gear sets 16 can be selectively<br>
driven by the engine 12 and/or by the motor/generators 18. While only one<br>
motor/generator 18 is shown in the exemplary embodiment of Figure 1, those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will recognize that multiple motor/generators may also be used within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
[0018]	The ESS 11 is electrically connected to a DC-to-AC converter 15 via a<br>
high-voltage bus 17 and one or more electrical relays or contactors 28, and to the<br>
motor/generators 18. The converter 15 is in turn connected to the motor/generator 18 by<br>
an AC bus 25. When operating as a motor, the motor/generator 18 can draw electrical<br>
energy from the ESS 11, and when operating as a generator, the motor/generator 18 can<br>
generate electrical energy for storage within the ESS 11. As shown in Figure 1, the<br>
contactor 28 is separate from the ESS 11. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that the contactor 28 and the ESS 11 may be alternately configured as a single<br>
unit.<br>
[0019]	Referring to Figure 2, a vehicle portion 10A of the vehicle 10 of Figure 1<br>
shows the ESS 11, the converter 15, and the motor/generator 18 in further detail. The<br>
controller 22 is in electrical communication with a measurement circuit or device 36,<br>
labeled "M" in Figure 2 for simplicity. Alternately, although not shown in Figure 2, the<br>
measurement device 36 may be functionally or physically integrated with the controller<br>
22. The measurement device 36 is any device that is operable for measuring an electrical<br>
impedance value between the high-voltage bus 17 (see Figure 1) and an electrical ground<br>
such as a chassis 32 of the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1). The measurement device 36 is<br><br>
therefore adapted for calculating a value that is proportional to the equivalent, parallel, or<br>
total impedance levels between the rails 17A and 17B with respect to the chassis 32 (see<br>
Figure 1), as will be described below. Alternately, the measurement device 36 is<br>
operable for separately calculating an impedance level between a respective one of the<br>
rails 17A, 17B and the chassis 32.<br>
[0020]	Additionally, each of the positive and negative rails 17A, 17B are<br>
connected to the converter 15 (also see Figure 1), which is operable for converting the<br>
direct current (DC) voltage supplied from the ESS 11 into a three-phase alternating<br>
current (AC) voltage usable by the motor/generator 18 (see Figure 1). The three phases<br>
are represented by the arrows i1, i2, and i3 in Figure 2, which are transmitted to the<br>
different inductive coils 30 of the motor/generator 18 via the conductors 25.<br>
[0021]	The contactor 28 of Figure 1 is shown as two separate contactors 28A and<br>
28B in Figure 2, which may either be separate devices from the ESS 11 or, as shown in<br>
phantom, may be configured with the ESS 11 as a unit. In one embodiment, one or both<br>
of the contactors 28A and 28B are single-pole, single-throw relay devices, or alternately<br>
are solid-state switches of the type known in the art. However, other relay devices, such<br>
as a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) or an insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistor (1GBT) solid-state device, each of the type known in the art, may be<br>
used within the scope of the invention. The contactor 28A is positioned on the positive<br>
rail 17A, and likewise, the contactor 28B is positioned on the negative rail 28B. In<br>
response to the shutdown of the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1) and/or upon the occurrence of a<br>
predetermined vehicle fault condition, each of the contactors 28A and 28B are<br>
commanded to open in the direction of arrow A, thus isolating or disconnecting the ESS<br>
11. When the vehicle 10 is operating, the controller 22 can command the contactors 28A,<br>
28B to close in the direction of arrow B, thus connecting the ESS 11 to the<br>
motor/generator 18 (see Figure 1) via the high-voltage bus 17 (see Figure 1).<br>
[0022]	Under certain circumstances, the contactors 28A, 28B may not open or<br>
break their respective electrical connection. For example, a mechanical failure such as a<br>
broken spring may prevent the contactor 28A, 28B from opening. Another possible<br>
cause is an electrical fault or control issue that might force one of the contactors 28A,<br>
28B to either open or close with an excessive or incorrect load across its terminals or<br><br>
contacts, which in turn might lead to a welded contactor condition. If one or both of the<br>
contactors 28A, 28B were to fail in a closed position, the vehicle control system, such as<br>
controller 22, could lose some of its ability to contain high voltage within the ESS 11.<br>
Likewise, if the contactors 28A, 28B fail in the open position, some control functionality<br>
can be lost. By sequencing the opening and closing of each of the contactors 28A and<br>
28B, the controller 22 can determine which contactor 28A, 28B has failed, and whether<br>
that contactor has failed in an open or a closed position.<br>
[0023]	Referring to Figure 3, the method or algorithm 100 of Figures 1 and 2<br>
utilizes the measurement device 36 (see Figure 2) to determine the first and second total<br>
impedance values (RV1 and RV2, respectively) between the rails 17A, 17B of the high-<br>
voltage bus 17 (see Figure 1) and the ground/chassis 32 (see Figure 2), to diagnose or<br>
determine the presence of a vehicle high-voltage fault condition, ESS isolation fault, or<br>
disconnected components, as described above, and to take appropriate maintenance<br>
actions in response thereto. The measurement device 36, as controlled by the controller<br>
22, selectively measures a first total impedance value, referred to hereinafter as RV1,<br>
when the contactors 28A, 28B are closed, and a second total impedance value, referred to<br>
hereinafter as RV2, when the contactors 28A, 28B are open. Using the method or<br>
algorithm 100, various vehicle fault conditions can be detected, as will now be discussed<br>
with reference to Figures 3 and 4.<br>
[0024]	Beginning with step 102, the algorithm 100 begins in conjunction with a<br>
shutdown of the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1), such as a normal process of turning off the<br>
engine 12 and/or the motor/generator 18 shown in Figure 1 when an operator turns an<br>
ignition switch or key to "off, or when otherwise determined by the controller 22 (see<br>
Figure 1). The algorithm 100 then proceeds to step 104.<br>
[0025]	At step 104, the algorithm 100 signals the measurement device 36 (see<br>
Figure 2) to measure or otherwise determine the first total impedance value (RV1). This<br>
value can be temporarily stored in a memory location of the controller 22 (see Figures 1<br>
and 2), such as a circular buffer. Depending on the size of the buffer that is used, a<br>
history of impedance values may be retained for access by a maintenance probe, remote<br>
access via a telematics system, etc., depending on the design of the vehicle 10. Once the<br><br>
first impedance value (RV1) has been properly recorded, the algorithm 100 proceeds to<br>
step 106.<br>
[0026]	At step 106, the algorithm 100 signals or commands the contactor 28 (see<br>
Figure 1) to open. As shown in Figure 2, in response to the command, each of the<br>
contactors 28A and 28B on the respective positive rail 17A and negative rail 17B open,<br>
i.e., move in the direction of arrow A, thus breaking the circuit between the electrical<br>
storage system (ESS) 11 and the load, such as the converter 15 and the motor/generator<br>
18 and/or the motor/generator 20 (see Figure 1). Once the contactor 28 (see Figure 1) has<br>
been so signaled or commanded, the algorithm 100 proceeds to step 108.<br>
[0027]	At step 108, the algorithm 100 signals the measurement device 36 (see<br>
Figure 2) to measure or otherwise determine the second total impedance value (RV2).<br>
This value can also be temporarily stored in a memory location of the controller 22 (see<br>
Figures 1 and 2), such as a second circular buffer or other suitable memory device. Once<br>
the second total impedance level has been properly recorded, the algorithm 100 proceeds<br>
in one embodiment to step 109, shown in phantom, and in another embodiment to step<br>
110.<br>
[0028]	At step 109, which is shown in phantom in Figure 3, the algorithm 100<br>
compares the total impedance values RV| and RV2 respectively determined at steps 104<br>
and 108, as explained above. The algorithm 100 accesses a threshold range<br>
corresponding to each of a "normal" and a "low" impedance value for each of the first<br>
and second total impedance values RV1 and RV2, respectively. Step 109 may be<br>
executed, for example, by accessing a look-up table that is stored within another memory<br>
location of the controller 22 (see Figures 1 and 2), as will now be described with<br>
reference to Figure 4.<br>
[0029]	Referring to Figure 4, a look-up table is indexed by the low and normal<br>
ranges corresponding to first total impedance value (RV1) taken during the pre-open, i.e.,<br>
closed, state of the contactor 28 (see Figure 1), and is also indexed by the second total<br>
impedance level (RV2) taken during the open state of the contactor 28 (see Figure 1). In<br>
the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4, the look-up table is therefore divided into<br>
six boxes or portions, i.e., low-low and low-normal, normal-low and normal-normal, and<br><br>
high-low and high-normal, with each portion corresponding to a particular predetermined<br>
fault condition aboard the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1).<br>
[0030]	According to one embodiment, the predetermined fault conditions include<br>
an ESS fault condition (low-low), which describes a condition in which the ESS 11 (see<br>
Figures 1 and 2) is insufficiently isolated from the vehicle chassis 32 (see Figure 2); a<br>
welded contactor condition (low-normal), in which one or both of the contactors 28A,<br>
28B of Figure 2 are welded closed, thus potentially draining energy from the ESS 11 (see<br>
Figures 1 and 2) and/or reducing the effectiveness of the contactor 28 (see Figure 1); a<br>
vehicle isolation fault (low-normal), in which a short is potentially present somewhere<br>
between the high-voltage bus 17 (see Figure 1) and the vehicle chassis 32 (see Figure 2);<br>
and a no-fault condition (normal-normal), in which none of the fault conditions described<br>
above are indicated. The predetermined fault conditions can also include a disconnected<br>
component fault, wherein one or more high-voltage components, such as an air<br>
conditioning module, are disconnected from the high-voltage bus 17 (see Figure 1). Such<br>
a condition is represented if the impedance value (RV1) measured during the pre-open<br>
state is determined to be high, regardless of the impedance value measured during the<br>
post-open state (RV2).<br>
[0031]	In one embodiment, the ranges for the pre-open state, i.e., the first total<br>
impedance level RV1, are set as follows: low = less than approximately 0.6 mega ohms<br>
(MΩ), and normal = approximately 0.8 MΩ to 1.5 MΩ, with a target "normal" value of<br>
approximately 1 MΩ. The limit or boundary between any low and normal range, or any<br>
normal and high range, should sufficiently varied to avoid false positive measurements.<br>
For example, if the low end of the normal range limit is set to 0.8 MΩ, a low isolation<br>
threshold point may be set to 0.6 MΩ, so as to minimize instances of "false positive"<br>
fault detection. In this embodiment, for example, the normal range for the open-state,<br>
i.e., the second total impedance level RV2, can be set approximately 3 to 5MΩ, with a<br>
target of approximately 4 MΩ. However, all of these ranges are intended to be<br>
exemplary, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other ranges may be<br>
substituted in accordance with the invention. After determining the system state, the<br>
algorithm 100 proceeds to step 112.<br><br>
[0032]	At step 110, the algorithm 100 compares the total impedance values RV1<br>
and RV2 respectively determined at steps 104 and 108, as explained above. Step 110<br>
may be executed, for example, by accessing a stored threshold multiplier or ratio that is<br>
stored within another memory location of the controller 22 (see Figures 1 and 2). For<br>
example, if the second total impedance value RV2 is not sufficiently larger than the first<br>
total impedance value RV1, the algorithm 100 can set a flag or diagnostic trouble code<br>
(DTC) as needed.<br>
[0033]	In one exemplary embodiment, the controller 22 can be programmed with<br>
a threshold RV2/RV1 ratio range of approximately 4:1 to 6:1, i.e., a RV2 to RV1 multiple<br>
range of approximately 4 to 6. In this example, if the value of RV2 is 2.0 MΩ and the<br>
value of RV1 is 1 MΩ., the ratio of RV2/RV1 of 2:1 falls outside of the allowable<br>
threshold range of 4:1 to 6:1, and thus would result in the setting of a data code in the<br>
controller 22 at step 112, as described below. Those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that the 4:1 to 6:1 range of ratios is exemplary, and larger or smaller ratios or<br>
multipliers may also be used within the scope of the invention by programming or setting<br>
the controller 22 accordingly. If after comparing the values of RV1 and RV2 at step 110,<br>
the algorithm 100 determines that the result or variance is outside of the predetermined<br>
allowable range, the algorithm 100 proceeds to step 112. Otherwise, the algorithm 100 is<br>
complete.<br>
[0034]	At step 112, the algorithm 100 executes a maintenance response aboard<br>
the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1) in response to the first and the second impedance levels, or<br>
RV1 and RV2, respectively. The maintenance response can be the setting of an<br>
appropriate code or message within the controller 22 (see Figures 1 and 2), such as a<br>
diagnostic trouble code (DTC) or flag indicating that a particular fault has occurred<br>
aboard the vehicle 10 (see Figure 1). For example, each fault that is diagnosed by the<br>
algorithm 100 can be assigned a unique DTC, such as a hex number, which may be<br>
pulled from the controller 22 as needed by a vehicle maintenance person, probe, or via<br>
remote telematics as needed. Other maintenance responses can include the illumination<br>
or activation of an audible and/or visible alarm or indicator lamp (not shown) within the<br>
vehicle 10 (see Figure 1), transmission of an alarm code to a remote location, etc.<br><br>
[0035]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
