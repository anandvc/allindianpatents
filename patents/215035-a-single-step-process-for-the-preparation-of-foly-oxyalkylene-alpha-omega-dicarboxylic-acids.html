8)	Stabilizer for water based epoxy formulations (H.E. Fried and C.J. Stark,<br>
PCT Intl. Appl. WO 9619, 514) and so on.<br><br>
In order to meet these growing requirements for poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha, omega- dicarboxylic acids, various methods for their preparation have been developed so far which can broadly be classified into following two types.<br>
1. Carboxymethylation of poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s<br>
In this method of preparation, terminal hydroxymethyl groups of poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s are derivatized with carboxymethyl groups (-CH2-COOH groups) so as to obtain poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha,omega- dicarbcxylic acids This method essentially involves following steps A) Activation of terminal hydroxyl groups by reacting poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s with strong bases such as potassium tertiary butoxide, silver oxide, sodium hydroxide etc. 3 i Reaction of alcoholate so obtained with reagents like bromo ethyl acetate, caloroethyl acetate etc. C) Saponification of ethyl ester followed by acidification of reaction mixture. D) Isolation of product.<br>
The above method has been used by various researchers (R.P. Garfield and G.M. Ananthramaiah, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 101, 3394 (1979), K. Ulbrich, J. Strohalm and J. Kopecek,.Makromol. Chem. 187, 1131 (1986), M. Pecher, J. Strohalm and K. Ulbrich, Makromol. Chem. Phys. 198, 1009 (1997), A.F. Buckmann, M. Morr and J. Goete, Makromol. Chem. 182, 1379 (1981), I. Keiji, I. Yuji and 0. Taketashi, Eur. Pat. Appl. EP. 206,448, A.J. Martinez and R.B. Greenwald, U.S. US 5605976A). Since this method of preparation for poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha,omega- dicarboxylic acids is a multistep process involving specialty reagents, it is not attractive for large scale production.<br><br>
2. Oxidation of poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s<br>
A number of patents which are based on this technique have "resn filed. Japanese patent, Japan Kokai 7300,528 discloses the preparation of low molecular  weight poly  (oxyethylene)-alpha,omega-  dicarboxytic  acids  by oxidation of poly (ethylene glycol)s using oxygen and concentrated nitric acid as oxidizing agent in an autoclave at 80 째C under 3 Kg /cm' pressure (E. Yonemitsue, T. Icshiki, Y. Kijima and T. Matsumoto, Japan Kokai "300,528). Low molecular weight poly (ethylene glycol)s have also been oxidized using Platinum / charcoal catalysts and oxygen under pressure at 50 째C in a column reactor  (Sanyo   Chemical   Industries   Ltd.   Jpn.   Kokai   Tokkyo   Koho   JP 8258,642). Preparation of poly (oxyethylene)-alpha,omega- dicarfacxyiic acids by   oxidation  of poly  (etliylene   glycol)s   hi   presence   of cobali  acetate quadrahdrate, using oxygen under pressure at 140 째C and using a mxture of catalysts viz. copper acetate, ammonium venadate, nitric acid and fonzaldehyde at 50 to 90 째C has also been reported (Nikka Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 5901,443 and W. Disteldorf,' W. Eisfeli and H. Hellbach, Gen. Offen. DE. 3,209,434, respectively).<br>
Czechoslovakian patent CS. 234,832 discloses the preparatiea of poly (oxyethylene)-alpha,omega- dicarboxylic acids of molecular weighs in the range of 1000 to 3000 by oxidation of corresponding poly (ethylecs g!ycol)s using potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid at 70 째C (I. Jan and C. rrantisek, Czech. CS. 234,832). Microbial oxidation of poly (ethylene grycol)s of molecular weights from 200 to 2000 by Rhinocladiella actrovirens bas been<br><br>
reported, wherein, the time period required for oxidation was upto 14 days (M. Shuichi, Y. Nobuo and Y. Sadao, Makromol. Chem. Rapid. Commun. 10, 63 (1989) ). Recently, US patent No. 5,256,819 has disclosed preparation of poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha, omega- dicarboxylic acids of wide range of molecular weights by oxidation of corresponding poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s using oxygen, nitric acid and 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as oxidizing agent (H.E. Fried U,S US5,256,819)<br>
Most of the above cited oxidation processes required either harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature, pressure etc. or specialty reagents like stable free radicals- 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine- 1- oxyl. Also in most of the cases conventional work up procedures which involve neutralization of oxidizing agents, concentration of solvents, removal of oxidation by-products and isolation of products, are followed. Thus there is a need to develop a simpler method for oxidation of poly (oxyalkylene glycoDs having wide range of molecular weights to corresponding dicarboxylic acids.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a single step process for the preparation of poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha.omega- dicarboxylic acids of low to very high molecular weights in high yields by oxidation of corresponding glycols using commonly available oxidizing agents under mild reaction conditions such as room temperature, atmospheric pressure etc.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a simpler method for removing the oxidation by-products from reaction mixture and thus obviate the conventional work up procedures.<br>
As compared to above mentioned various oxidizing agents, Jone's reagent, which is a mixture of chromium trioxide and sulfuric acid and water, is a strong oxidizing agent which oxidizes hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups at temperatures in the range of 10 째C to room temperature (25 째C) (L.S. Loeffler, S.F. Britcher and W. Baumgarten, J. Med. Chem. 13, 926 (1970). Despite such strong oxidizing power, Jone's reagent has not been used in oxidation of poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s to corresponding dicarboxylic acids. It has now been found that poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha,omega- dicarboxylic acids can be produced in high yields by oxidation of poly (oxyalkylene glycol)s using Jone's reagent as oxidizing agent in suitable solvent at room temperature.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a single step process for the preparation of poly (oxyalkylene)- alpha, omega- dicarboxylic acids of the formula HO2CCH2O(CH2CHRO)nCH:CO2H, wherein R is hydrogen, methyl or mixtures of hydrogen and methyl on the individual molecule and n is an integer of from 100 to 2500, which comprises reacting the corresponding poly (oxyalkylene glycol) with an oxidizing agent in form of Jone' reagent comprising of aqueous solution of chromium trioxide and sulfuric acid in the molar proportion of 1:1 to 1:1.75 , in a polar solvent at a temperature in the range of 100째C to room temperature for a period ranging between 1 hour to 12 hours, quenching ihe reaction by adding known free radical scavenger.<br><br>
removing oxidation by-products from reaction mixture by adsorbing them on an adsorbing agent to obtain product in the solution, evaporating the clear solution to obtain products- poly (oxyalkylene)- alpha, omega-diacrboxylic acids.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention , poly(oxyalkylene glycol)s used is such as compounds of the formula HOCH2O(CH2CHRO)nCH2OH wherein R is hydrogen, methyl or mixtures of hydrogen and methyl on the individual molecule and n is an integer which represents the average numbers of oxyalkylene groups, preferably from 100 to 250<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention , the oxidizing agent used is such as Jone's reagent (chromium trioxide and sulfuric acid dissolved in water) consisting of aqueous water solution of chromium trioxide and sulfuric acid in the molar proportion of 1:1 to 1:1.75 respectively or a combination of two separate components i.e. water solution of chromium trioxide and concentrated sulfuric acid<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention , poly (oxyalkylene glycol) is for use in the present invention are commercially available polyethylene glycol)s of molecular weight 4000, 6000, 20,000, 1,00,000 and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) of molecular weight 5000.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment the free radical scavenger used may be such as isopropyl alcohol, mercaptoethanol.<br>
In still another embodiment the solvent used may be such as acetonitrile, dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, cyclohexanone.<br>
In another embodiment the weight ratio of poly (oxyalkylene glycol) to solvent may be in the range from about 1:5 to 1:200, more preferably in the range from about 1:10 to 1:100.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, the adsorbing agents used may be such as Fuller's Earth, Kiesleger, ion exchange resins, activated charcoal.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the adsorbing agent required for efficient adsorption of chromium salts from reaction mixture is typically in the range of about 10 % to 30 % of the weight of poly (oxyalkylene glycol) taken<br>
t<br>
for the reaction. Adsorption process typically requires 2 to 3 hours stirring of reaction mixture after adsorbing agent is added in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Subsequently the reaction mixture is filtered to obtain clear and colorless solution which is then evaporated in vacuo to obtain products.<br>
In a feature of the present invention, in order to oxidize on mole of hydroxymethyl groups, the amount of Jone's reagent used contains 1 mole chromium trioxide and 1.75 moles sulfuric acid, dissolved in water.<br>
In another feature of the present invention, the process of the present invention is typically conducted under mild conditions. Poly (oxyalkylene glycol) is dissolved in suitable solvent and the appropriate amount of Jone's reagent is added to it and the reaction mixture is'stirred at room temperature for a period of about 1 hour to 12 hours. After stirring the reaction mixture for the above mentioned time period, the reaction is quenched by adding isopropyl alcohol as free radical scavenger. Blue green colored chromium salts are formed in the reaction mixture as result of oxidation. These salts form a fine suspension which is difficult to separate from the reaction mixture by conventional filtration, especially in the case of high molecular weight poly (oxyalkylene glycols). Thus in order to remove these oxidation by-products the process of the instant invention uses the method of adsorption of the salts from reaction mixture onto an adsorbing agent.<br><br>
hi an another feature of die present invention, the adsorption process conditions vary depending upon the molecular weight of poly (oxyaikylene)-alpha,omega- dicarboxylic acid prepared by the process of the instant invention, e.g. for poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha,omega- dicarboxylic acids of molecular weights 4000 and 6000, a large fraction of chromium salts can be filtered out of reaction mixture, rendering less amount of adsorbing agent to be used for the treatment. But poly (oxyalkylene)-alpha,omega- dicarbcxylic acids of molecular weights 20,000 and 1,00,000, chromium salts formed after the reaction a fine suspension which is practically inseparable and thus required the above mentioned adsorption process for its removal.<br>
The ranges and limitations provided in the instant specification and claims are those which are believed to particularly point out and distinctly claim the present invention. It is however understood that other ranges and limitations which perform substantially the same function in the same or substantially the same manner to obtain the same or substantially die same results are intended to be within the scope of the instant invention as defined by the instant specification and claims.<br>
The process of the instant invention will be further described by the following examples which are provided for illustration and are not to be construed as<br>
limiting the invention.<br><br>
