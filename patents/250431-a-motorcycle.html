				<td>DESCRIPTION MOTORCYCLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle, in which a frame member constituting a vehicle body frame is formed and divided into a half on a left side of a vehicle body and a half on a right side of the vehicle body to be joined to each other by means of bolts.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
As a vehicle body frame in conventional motorcycles, there is one disclosed in, for example; JP-B-6--'86231; - With the vehicle body frame shown in the publication, the frame member is formed by casting and there is no parts welded, so that an outward appearance is not marred and reduction in manufacturing cost can be achieved.<br>
[0003]<br>
The frame member is of a so-called diamond type to comprise a half on a left side of a vehicle body and a half on a right side of the vehicle body, which halves are molded by die casting. The both halves, respectively, comprise a head<br>
1<br><br>
pipe part that holds a head pipe, a main frame extending rearwardly downwardly of the head pipe part, rear arm brackets extending downward from a rear end of the main frame, and an engine support stay projecting downward from midway the main frame. Also, the both halves are clamped by bolts in a mutually overlapping state to be thereby assembled. [0004]<br>
The half on the left side of the vehicle body and the half on the right side of the vehicle body are joined together by joining clamp parts provided on the main frame by means of bolts and bridging a cross pipe in a region below rear arm supports on the pair of rear arm brackets. [0005]<br>
A rear arm for support of a rear wheel is supported on the rear arm brackets to be able to swing vertically. The rear arm comprises a pair of left and right connection armsprovided on a front end of the vehicle body. The connection arms, respectively, are arranged inwardly of the rear arm brackets on the vehicle body and supported on the rear arm brackets by means of a pivot shaft that extends in a left and right direction.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
[0006]<br>
2<br><br>
A conventional bolt joint type vehicle body frame shown in JP-B-6-86231 involves a problem of a decrease in stiffness as compared with a weld type vehicle body frame . In particular, when a rear arm exerts a force in a direction of twist on rear arm brackets, a rear end of a vehicle body is liable to be displaced in the direction. The reason why a conventional vehicle body frame is thus decreased in stiffness is that a part directly joining a half on a left side of a vehicle body and a half on a right side of the vehicle body is a main frame, and such joint part is upwardly and forwardly away from a rear arm support. While the both halves are joined to each other through a cross pipe disposed below the rear arm support, the rear arm support is decreased in support stiffness since they are joined through the cross pipe.<br>
Therefore, a motorcycle formed with the use of the vehicle body -frame structured and shown-in-JP-B-6-86231 -needs to enhance the vehicle body frame in stiffness, so that there is caused a disadvantage of degradation in running performance attributable to a weight of the vehicle body frame. [0007]<br>
The invention has been thought of in order to dissolve the problem and has its object to provide a motorcycle that maintains a vehicle body frame in stiffness and enables lighting while using the vehicle body frame, which is joined by bolts, to achieve an improvement in outward appearance and<br>
3<br><br>
reduction in cost.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0008]<br>
A motorcycle according to the invention comprises rear arm brackets comprising a left rear arm bracket and a right rear arm bracket and joined to each other by a clamp member, a left rear arm body pivotally supported on the left rear arm bracket, and a right rear arm body pivotally supported on the right rear arm bracket, the left rear arm body is arranged outside the left rear arm bracket in a direction of car breadth, and the right rear arm body is arranged outside the right rear arm bracket in the direction of car breadth.<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THE INVENTION [0009]<br>
As described above, according to the invention, as compared with the case where the rear arm brackets are positioned outside the rear arm bodies, those parts of the left and right rear arm brackets, which pivotally support the rear arm bodies, can be made close to each other in a dxrection of car breadth to enhance joints thereof in stiffness. Therefore, while a construction is adopted, in which the pair of left and right rear arm brackets are joined to each other by means of bolts, it is possible to firmly support the rear arm. As a<br>
4<br><br>
result, it is possible according to the invention to realize a motorcycle, in which the rear arm brackets are formed by casting whereby the vehicle body frame can be made lightweight while manufacturing cost is held down. [0010]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2 and the invention described in claim 3, the rear arm can be enhanced in support stiffness.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, a bearing part of the rear arm can be improved in dust resistance.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, a load attributable to input from a side of the rear arm and tending to shift the mating surfaces from each other is lessened by the pivot shaft, so that the mating surfaces are hard to shift from each other, thus enabling firmly supporting the rear arm. 10011]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 6 and the invention described in claim 7, the frame member extending from the head pipe part to the rear arm brackets can be formed without welding, so that a motorcycle having a high running performance can provided at low cost. [0012]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 8, by connecting an engine to the pair of left and right frame members, respectively, it is possible to have the engine functioning<br>
5<br><br>
as a cross member for reinforcement. Therefore, it is possible according to the invention to enhance the vehicle body frame in stiffness. [0013]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 9, the pair of left and right frame members can be reinforced by the downtube, so that it is possible to further enhance the vehicle body frame in stiffness.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 10, it is possible to function the downtube as a cross member interposed between the pair of left and right frame members. Therefore, a vehicle body frame having a high stiffness can be formed although a construction is adopted, in which the pair of left and right frame members are joined to each other by means of bolts. [0014]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 11, one of the halves of the downtube can be formed by forging to have a high stiffness and brackets for mounting of the lower end of the engine and other parts can be easily formed on the other of the halves of the downtube. Therefore, it is possible according to the invention to achieve an improvement of the vehicle body frame in stiffness and reduction in cost. [0015]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 12, the<br>
6<br><br>
front half of the downtube can posses stiffness, so that running<br>
is made stable.<br>
[0016]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 13, the engine 10 can be firmly supported by a pair of parts, which are formed on the intermediate parts of the downtube to be wide in a direction of car breadtn.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 14, the front half of the downtube can be formed lightweight while ensuring strength. Also, by passing a hose, a lead wire, etc. through a part of the front half having a C-shaped cross section, pebbles or the like, which is repelled by the front wheel, can be prevented from striking against these elements. [0017]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 15, the front half of the downtube can be prevented from interfering with the exhaust pipe of the engine. Therefore, it is possible according to the invention to bend and form the exhaust pipe with an ideal radius of curvature, so that the engine can be reduced in exhaust resistance.<br>

A catalyst converter (not shown) is mounted midway the collecting pipe 17. An upper end of the collecting pipe 17 is formed in a bifurcate manner to be connected to a pair of left and right silencers (not shown) accommodated inside the muffler covers 3. [0021]<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the vehicle body frame 8 of the motorcycle 1 is a cradle type one to surround the engine 10 as viewed from laterally of the vehicle body by, and comprises a pair of left and right main frame members 21, 21 molded into a predetermined shape by casting, a downtube 23 joined to the main frame members 21 by joint bolts 22, a rear frame 25 joined to xear ends' of the mai.n frame members "21 by joint bolts 24" (see Fig. 4), and a cross member 26 bridged between intermediate parts of the main frame members 21. The main frame members 21 constitute a frame member in the invention. The main frame members 21 and the rear frame 25 are molded from an aluminum alloy material by die casting to have a predetermined shape. [0022]<br>
The main frame member 21 on a left side of the vehicle body and the main frame member 21 on a right side of the vehicle<br>
11<br><br>
body, respectively, are formed integral with a head pipe half 28 that rotatably supports a steering shaft 27 {see Fig. 10) of the front fork 5, main frames 29 extending rearwardly of the vehicle body from the head pipe half 28, and a rear arm bracket 30 extending downward from the main frame 2 9 to support the rear arm 12. As shown in Fig. 19, the rear arm bracket 30 comprises a left rear arm bracket 30L positioned on the left side of the vehicle body and a right rear arm bracket 30R positioned on the right side of the vehicle body, which rear arm brackets are joined to each other by joint bolts 33 and joint bolts 35, both of which are described later. [0023]<br>
The head pipe half 28 is formed to have a U-shaped cross section diverging toward a center of the vehicle body in a left and right direction as shown in Figs. 11 to 14. That is, the head pipe half 28 is formed such that a left head pipe half and a right head pipe half are joined to each other to constitute a head pipe 31.<br>
The both head pipe halves 28, 28 are joined by joining front clamp parts 32 provided in three locations at front ends of the both head pipe halves 28 by means of joint bolts 33 and joining rear clamp parts 34 provided in three locations at rear ends of the both head pipe halves 28 by means of joint bolts 35 as shown in Figs. 5, 10, and 23. The joint bolts 33 and the joint bolts 35 constitute a clamp member in the invention.<br>
12<br><br>
When such joining work is conducted, bearings 36, 37 (see Fig. 10) for support of the steering shaft, respectively, are fitted into upper and lower ends of the head pipe 31 according to the embodiment. [0024]<br>
The main frames 2 9 are formed to have a C-shaped cross section opened toward the center of the vehicle body in the left and right direction and provided therein with a reinforcement rib (not shown) . The main frame 29 of the main frame member 21 on the left side of the vehicle body and the main frame 29 of the main frame member 21 on the right side of the vehicle body are formed to separate from each other in the left and right direction of the vehicle body from the vicinity of and rearwardly of the head pipe part as shown in Fig. 4 and connected to each other by means of the cross member 2-6 (F±gs-. 4 and 16) . The cross member 26 is connected to the main frames 29 by fixing bolts 26a, 26b as shown in Fig; 6. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, engine support brackets 38 projecting downward are formed integral with lower ends of the both main frames 29, 29. The engine support brackets 38 are connected to an upper end of the engine 10 via a stay 39 (see Fig. 5) . That is, the pair of left and right main frames 29, 29 are connected to each other through the engine 10 and the stay 39. The fuel tank 9 is supported on and fixed to the main frames 29, 29.<br>
13<br><br>
[0025]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the downtube 23 comprises a front half 41 extending vertically in front of the engine 10, and a rear half 42 extending longitudinally below the engine 10. In addition, while the downtube 23 according to the embodiment is not formed from a tubular body, it is referred to a downtube in the specification of the present application since it has the same function as that of a downtube of a conventional cradle frame. [0026]<br>
The front half 41 and the rear half 42 of the downtube 23 are joined to each other by means of joint bolts 43. An upper end of the front half 41 is joined to a lower end of the head pipe half 28 by means of joint bolts 22, and a rear end of the rear half 42 is joined to a lower end of the rear arm bracket 313 by means of joint bolts 22. Thus, by jornxng the downtube 23 to the head pipe half 28 and the rear arm bracket 30, the lower end of the head pipe half 28 and the lower end of the rear arm bracket 30 are connected to each other through the downtube 23. The vehicle body frame 8 according to the embodiment is constructed such that by removing the downtube 23 from the main frame members 21, a space is formed in the main frame members 21 to afford removing the engine 10 forwardly downward. That is, the motorcycle 1 enables mounting and dismounting the engine 10 together with the downtube 23 from<br>
14<br><br>
the main frame members 21. [0027]<br>
The front half 41 of the downtube 23 is molded into a predetermined shape by means of forging. The front half 41 is formed to have a shape substantially along a front edge of the engine 10 as shown in Figs. 1 and 5, and formed to bifurcate downward as shown in Fig. 7(b), as viewed from laterally of the vehicle body. Detailedly, the front half 41 is formed to be downward Y-shaped as viewed from rearwardly of the vehicle body to comprise a single upper part 41a and two lower parts 41b, 41c. The upper end of the front half 41 is interposed between the main frame member 21 {the head pipe half 28) on the left side of the vehicle body and the main frame member 21 (the head pipe half 28) on the right side of the vehicle body and clamped by the two joint bolts 22, 22 extending therethrough- as shown in Fig: 15 That is, the upper end is interposed between the pair of left and right main frame members 21, 21. [0028]<br>
A vertically intermediate part of the front half 41 is formed to have a C-shaped cross section opened toward the rear of the vehicle body as shown in Fig. 7. The part having a C-shaped cross section is denoted by the character 41d in Fig. 7 (b) . The part 41d having a C-shaped cross section is molded by a die at the time of forging. While not shown, a hose, a<br>
15<br><br>
lead wire, etc. can be extended through the part 41d having a C-shaped cross section.<br>
That region 41e of the upper part of the front half 41, which corresponds to the exhaust pipe 13 of the cylinder 15 on the front side of the vehicle body, is formed to be small in width in a front and rear direction of the vehicle body as compared with the remaining part as shown in Fig. 5. [0029]<br>
Aplate-shaped bracket 45 projecting toward the rear side of the vehicle body is mounted to the lower parts 41b, 41c of the front half 41 by means of mount bolts 46 as shown in Fig. 5, and a front end of the crankcase 14 is connected to the lower parts through the bracket 45 and bolts 47 on a side of the engine 10. Those parts of the lower parts 41b, 41c, to which the bracket 45 is mounted, are formed to be solid as shown in Fig. 21.<br>
A connection between the lower end of the front half 41 and the front end of the rear half 42 adopts a construction, in which the both ends are clamped by joint bolts 43 in a state, in which the rear half 42 overlaps on the front half 41 as shown in Fig. 5. [0030]<br>
The rear half 42 of the downtube 23 is formed in a bifurcate manner to be opened toward the front of the vehicle body as shown in Fig. 8 . Detailedly, the rear half 42 comprises<br>
16<br><br>
a pair of left and right front parts 42a, 42b connected to the front half 41 and a rear part 42c connected to the rear arm bracket 30, which parts are formed integral bymeans of forging. The front parts 42a, 42b and the rear part 42c are formed to be hollow and communicated internally to each other. The front parts 42a, 42b have a cross sectional shape shown in Fig. 22. The front parts 42a, 42b and the lower parts 41b, 41c of the front half 41 constitute a pair of parts, which separate from each other in the direction of car breadth, referred to in the invention. [0031]<br>
The front parts 42a, 42b are formed on upper surfaces<br>
thereof with protrusively extending brackets 48 as shown in<br>
Fig. 22 and connected to a front lower end of the crankcase<br>
14 through the brackets 48 and bolts 49 on the side of the engine<br>
10.	- -<br>
Protrusively provided on a rear end of the" rear part 42c are brackets 50 for connection to a cushioning unit, and a bracket 51 for connection to the rear arm bracket. The brackets 50 for connection to a cushioning unit are formed in pair on the left and right, and the bracket 51 for connection to the rear arm bracket is formed ab the center of the vehicle body in the left and right direction to extend in the front and rear direction and in the left and right direction. [0032]<br>
