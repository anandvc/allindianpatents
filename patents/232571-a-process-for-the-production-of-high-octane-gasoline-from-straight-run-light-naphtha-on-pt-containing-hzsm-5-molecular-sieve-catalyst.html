				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of high-octane<br>
gasoline from straight run light naphtha on Pt containing HZSM-5 molecular<br>
sieve catalyst.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to a process for the utilization of<br>
straight run light naphtha feedstock available from various refineries, into value<br>
added aromatics with low amounts of benzene which can be used as blending<br>
stocks for improvement of octane number in gasoline fuel. In addition to highoctane<br>
gasoline liquid product, some amounts of gas by-product are also<br>
obtained which can be used as domestic fuel (LPG).<br>
The fast growing automobile population as well as increasing pressure from<br>
environmental legislators has resulted in demand for good quality gasoline in the<br>
country. The focal point for the improvement of gasoline quality, at present is<br>
centered around benzene content of 5% (V/V) with already lead free gasoline<br>
available in India (Ref. Report of Sub-group on the Refining for IXth plan 1996).<br>
It is stated that some of the refiners will be unable to meet the specification of<br>
benzene leading to gasoline production loss. To address the benzene problem in<br>
gasoline it is suggested to increase IBP of reformer feed by adjusting naphtha<br>
splitter cut point which leads to substantial loss in gasoline production volume<br>
and increased quantities of light naphtha. As a result increasing interest is shown<br>
in the development of new catalysts and processes, which allow production of<br>
gasoline with sufficiently high octane numbers, making use of unconventional<br>
low value feed stock such as light naphtha into standard gasoline production. In<br>
addition to this, the demand for LPG is also growing much faster in India at<br>
growth rate of 12 to 13 percent per year. The corresponding deficit of LPG in<br>
2000-01 is 4 million tons and expected to increase up to 7.8 million tons by the<br>
year 2010-2011 (Sundar Rajan Committee Report on Hydrocarbon perspective<br>
1996, Ref LPG News of India, March'96, p 17).<br>
tight naphtha is one of the least viable petroleum feed stocks treated today.<br>
Projected production of straight run light naphtha cut (IBP-130) other than<br>
catalytic reforming feed in India indicates 1-1.25 MMTPA (million metric tons)<br>
of light naphtha is available from various refineries in 1996-97. Light naphtha<br>
mainly contains Cs and C6 hydrocarbons (30 to 40 wt%) depending upon the<br>
source. Due to high percentage of n-paraffins in light naphtha it has lower<br>
research octane number (RON) and high RVP (Reid Vapour Pressure) due to nand<br>
i-pentanes, hence it cannot be used directly for gasoline blending. Thus, the<br>
conversion of light naphtha into other petroleum and petrochemical products<br>
gains significance in this scenario.<br>
Conventionally, gasoline is being produced from the Catalytic reforming process<br>
of naphtha and Fluid catalytic cracking units from various refineries. The<br>
indigenous gasoline production by refineries with low benzene content will be<br>
inadequate to meet the demands in future like at present. The catalyst used for<br>
reforming process is monometallic Pt/Al2O3 or Pt-Re/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst.<br>
Although these processes are used all over the world, there are number of<br>
limitations in the use of these catalysts. The conventional catalyst is not effective<br>
in promoting aromatization of light naphtha rich in C5 hydrocarbons. The<br>
catalyst is also not very effective in promoting the aromatization of straight<br>
chain paraffins such as n-hexane and n-heptane present in the feed that remain<br>
unconverted. On the other hand, LPG production either from refineries or from<br>
gas fields is not enough to meet the demands. The import situation is also not<br>
encouraging, as only a few private entrepreneurs have actually created facilities<br>
for import market. Therefore the increasing demand for good quality gasoline<br>
and increasing gap between LPG deficit and import capacity also indicates the<br>
need to develop novel processes for the production of gasoline as well as LPG<br>
from cheaply available feed stocks, viz., light naphtha.<br>
There are reports in the literature on the conversion of these straight chain<br>
paraffins into aromatics, using zeolites and metal-doped zeolites as catalyst.<br>
Reference may be made to a process developed by Mobil researchers (Ind. Eng.<br>
Chem. Process. Design Dev., 25 (1986) wherein the preparation of aromatics<br>
from variety of feedstock such as pyrolysis gasoline, unsaturated gases from<br>
catalytic cracker, paraffinic naphtha and LPG have been described.<br>
Another reference may be made to (Patent of Russia Federation No 1141704,<br>
Appl. 17.06.1983) wherein method of producing gasoline fractions from gas<br>
condensate over HZSM-5 catalyst has described. The limitation of this process is<br>
that it utilizes long range naphtha (80-180°C) which is also a feedstock for<br>
catalytic reforming unit.<br>
Another reference may be made to (Hydrocarbon Processing Sept., 1989 p 72)<br>
wherein a process developed jointly by UOP Inc. and British Petroleum, based<br>
on gallium doped zeolite catalyst has been reported. In this process LPG was<br>
converted into BTX aromatics and the process has been demonstrated in a largescale<br>
pilot plant of the British Petroleum Grangemouth refinery in Scotland.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to (US patent 5,026,938 dated 25th June'<br>
1991) wherein a process for converting a gaseous feed stock containing C3-C5<br>
paraffins into aromatics hydrocarbons by contacting the feed with gallosilicate<br>
molecular sieve catalyst has been described.<br>
The draw back of all these processes is that these are mainly related to the<br>
production of aromatics from paraffins of €3 - Cs range which are in high<br>
demand as LPG in India.<br>
Still another reference may be made to US patent 5,125, 415, dated June 1992<br>
wherein the use of Pt-Sn-ZSM 5 catalyst for the production of mono-alkyl<br>
aromatics from Cg n-paraffins containing feed stocks has been described. The<br>
limitation of the above process is production of xylenes from Ca-Cg<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
Still another reference may be made to (IPA No. 010/DEL/2001 dated<br>
05/01/2001) wherein a process for the conversion of natural gas liquid (NGL)<br>
into liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and high-octane gasoline over modified<br>
ZSM-5 zeolite has been reported. The limitation of above process is that zeolite<br>
catalyst was modified by steaming method and it produces more LPG (55 wt%)<br>
than aromatics (22wt%).<br>
Still another reference may be made to (IPA No. 2627/DEL/96-dated 29/11/96)<br>
wherein a process for the preparation of a novel modified ZSM-5 zeolite has<br>
been reported. In this process zeolite catalyst was modified by steaming method<br>
followed by acid leaching to remove the extra framework alumina.<br>
The limitations of the above process are firstly formation of high quantity (8-12<br>
wt %) of dry gas (Q+C2) during the n- heptane conversion which will be a loss<br>
to the economy of the process. Secondly the preparation of ZSM-5 catalyst in<br>
this process involves acid leaching step which involves the use of hazardous<br>
mineral acids viz. HC1.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
production of high-octane gasoline from straight run light naphtha on platinum<br>
containing HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst, which obviates the drawbacks as<br>
detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the conversion<br>
of light naphtha into high octane low benzene content unleaded gasoline as a<br>
blender to boost the octane number along with LPG as by product by using a<br>
catalyst system containing platinum supported ZSM-5 zeolite composite.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of platinum metal modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst by impregnation<br>
method with out acidity modification by steaming and acid leaching steps.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process, which utilizes the straight run light naphtha containing up to 35 hydrocarbon components for the production of high-octane gasoline unlike the other existing processes.<br>
Still another object of invention is to convert C5 -C7 paraffinic and C6- C8 naphthenic components efficiently to produce high-octane gasoline.<br>
Another object of invention is to provide a process that produces in addition to n-paraffinic and naphthenic components, isoparaffins; benzene and other aromatics present in the feed also can be effectively converted to give high octane gasoline with low benzene content and LPG.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of high-octane gasoline from straight run light naphtha containing C6 to C8 range paraffins and naphthenes on a Pt containing HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst which comprises:<br>
(i) impregnating 0.1-2.0 wt% of Pt from tetramine platinum chloride on a HZSM-5<br>
zeolite extrudate, (ii) drying the above said zeolite extrudate at a temperature of 110°C for a period of 10-<br>
12 hrs followed by  calcinations  at a temperature  of 400-600°C for a period of 1-4<br>
hrs in static air, (iii)loading the   above said treated Pt impregnated zeolite extrudates in high pressure<br>
reactor and reducing it by passing hydrogen for a period of 2-5 hours at a temperature<br>
of 400-500°C and at a flow rate of 8-12 1/h into the reactor, (iv) cooling the above said Pt impregnated zeolite bed  to a temperature of about 300°C<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere and increasing thereafter further bed temperature to 300-<br>
600°C, (v) passing light naphtha through the   above said bed at a weight hourly space velocity<br>
ranging from 1 to 8 hrs' and at a pressure in the range of 1 to 25 kg/cm2 and in the<br>
absence of nitrogen to obtain a mixture of high octane gasoline and LPG and<br>
separating the gasoline from the mixture by conventional method..<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the light naphtha feedstock comprises light naphtha containing C6 to C8 range paraffins and naphthenes.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the reaction temperature is in the range of 400-500°C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the pressure is in the range of 1-10 kg/cm2.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the weight hourly space velocity of light naphta is in the range of 2-8hrs-1.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the Research Octane Number (RON) of straight light naphtha fraction is increased from 64 to 97 in the product with gain of 34 units.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the platinum impregnated ZSM- 5 zeolite composite used is prepared by incipient wetness method.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the catalyst used is regenerated by oxidative combustion.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the total amount of platinum metal added into HZSM-5 molecular sieve is in the range of 0.1 to 1.1 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the catalyst used results in the reduction of the sulfur content in light naphtha feed stock from 50 ppm level sulfur to 10 ppm level sulfur in the product.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the process conditions viz.<br>
pressure can be varied to in order to increase the aromatic content and decrease<br>
the LPG in product mixture advantageously.<br>
In the present invention, preparation of the catalyst for the process does not<br>
involve the steps of steaming and acid leaching before the actual catalytic<br>
application. The mentioned catalyst is environmentally friendly as the<br>
preparation does not involve the use of hazardous mineral acids, viz., HC1,<br>
HNO3 etc.<br>
The detailed steps of the process are:<br>
About 18cc of the catalyst (13 g) in extruded form of 1.5 to 2 mm diameter is<br>
loaded in a fixed bed, down flow, high pressure reactor. Before the test runs, the<br>
catalyst is reduced at 450°C with H2 gas for 4 hours with flow rate of 10 1/h. It is<br>
cooled down to 300°C in N2 flow and heated again to desired reaction<br>
temperature. The light naphtha is pumped by plunger type feed pump and N2<br>
flow was stopped totally. Reactor effluents are cooled before being fed to highpressure<br>
separator. The vapors from separator are purged, while the liquid phase<br>
is sent to stabilizer column. Regeneration of the deactivated catalyst in reactor is<br>
carried out by conventional procedure using air and nitrogen mixture. The liquid<br>
product is analyzed using a gas Chromatograph fitted with Tetra Cyano Ethoxy<br>
Propionitrile column and FID detector. The gaseous products are analyzed using<br>
Squalane column.<br>
In the present invention, the process conditions have been optimized for the<br>
controlled d+ C2 (dry gas) yield, which is not desired in the gasoline process. In<br>
order to reduce the duration of regeneration of the catalyst thereby to improve<br>
the catalyst life against the coke lay down, 0.4 wt% of platinum metal is doped<br>
on HZSM-5 catalyst. In the present invention, the novel process developed can<br>
operate for maximization of LPG too by simply altering the process parameters.<br>
The catalyst used in present process is a novel platinum supported HZSM-5<br>
zeolite in which parent ZSM-5 zeolite composite was procured from Zeolyst<br>
international (Lot No. 1822-43). The zeolite to binder ratio of HZSM-5<br>
extrudates were 80:20. These extrudates were impregnated with 0.4 wt% of Pt<br>
from tetraamine platinum chloride (Aldrich) solution. These extrudates were<br>
oven dried at 110°C for 12 hrs and then processed to calcination at 500°C for<br>
3hrs in static air.<br>
The Physico-chemical properties of the zeolite catalyst are as follows:<br>

This table shows the conversion of light naphtha feed stock having RON of 64<br>
into aromatics rich (60%) liquid product with low benzene content having a<br>
to<br>
RON 97.4. The novelty of this process is that 85 wt% of high-octane gasoline<br>
was produced from low value feedstock, which could also meet the future<br>
environmental regulations on gasoline in terms of low benzene content and low<br>
sulphur level.<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
l.The process of the present invention converts all types of hydrocarbon<br>
components present in the light naphtha feed viz. Paraffins, isoparaffins,<br>
naphthenes and benzene into aromatic hydrocarbons, isoparaffmic and LPG, at<br>
high selectivity with single catalyst system.<br>
2.Light naphtha, which does not have potential use as conventional reformer<br>
feed stock, can be used as a feed in this process.<br>
3.The catalyst used in this process is ecofriendly and it does not involve the acid<br>
leaching with hazardous mineral acids such as HC1 during preparation.<br>
4.The catalyst used in this process reduces dry gas yields to 2 wt% with increase<br>
of high-octane liquid product and thereby improves the economics of this<br>
process.<br>
5.LPG, which is a by-product in the present process, can meet the industrial and<br>
domestic demands.<br>
6.The process does not require hydrogen during feed cut in.<br>
7.The process also does not require use of corrosive organic chloride additives.<br>
8.The high-octane liquid a major product obtained in the process can be used as<br>
a gasoline blender to boost octane number.<br>
9.This process is economically profitable and depending on the capital<br>
investment the pay back period will be 1.5 to 3 years.<br>
lO.The process maintains constant production of high-octane gasoline pool by<br>
utilization of light naphtha from reformate.<br>
11. The catalyst can desulphurize the synthesized gasoline to lOppm from<br>
SOppm of light naphtha feed.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A process for the production of high-octane gasoline from straight run light naphtha<br>
containing C6 to C8 range paraffins and naphthenes on a Pt containing HZSM-5<br>
molecular sieve catalyst which comprises<br>
(i) impregnating 0.1-2.0 wt% of Pt from tetramine platinum chloride on a HZSM-5<br>
zeolite extrudate, (ii) drying the  above said zeolite extrudate at a temperature of 110°C for a period of<br>
10-12 hrs followed by calcinations at a temperature of 400-600°C for a period of<br>
1-4 hrs in static air, (iii)loading the above said treated Pt impregnated zeolite extrudates in high pressure<br>
reactor and reducing it   by passing hydrogen for a period of 2-5 hours at a<br>
temperature of 400-500°C and at a flow rate of 8-12 1/h into the reactor, (iv)cooling the above said Pt impregnated zeolite bed   to a temperature of about<br>
300°C   under   nitrogen   atmosphere   and   increasing   thereafter   further   bed<br>
temperature to 300-600°C, (v) passing light naphtha through the    above said bed at a weight hourly space<br>
velocity ranging from 1 to 8 hrs ' and at a pressure in the range of 1 to 25 kg/cm2<br>
and in the absence of nitrogen to obtain a mixture of high octane gasoline and<br>
LPG and separating the gasoline from the mixture by conventional method..<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction temperature used is preferably in the range of 400-500°C.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction pressure used is preferably in the range of 1 -10 kg/cm2.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the weight hourly space velocity of light naphta is preferably in the range of 2-8hrs '.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the Research Octane Number (RON) of straight light naphtha fraction is increased from 64 to 97 in the product with gain of 34 units.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to5, wherein the platinum impregnated ZSM- 5 zeolite composite used is prepared by incipient wetness method.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, wherein the catalyst used is regenerated by oxidative combustion.<br><br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim 1 to 7, wherein the total amount of platinum metal added into HZSM-5 molecular sieve is in the range of 0.1 to 1.1 wt%.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 8, wherein the catalyst used results in the reduction of the sulfur content in light naphtha feed stock from 50 ppm level sulfur to 10 ppm level sulfur in the product.<br>
10.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 9,wherein the pressure is varied in order to increase the aromatic content and decrease the LPG in product mixture.<br>
11.	A process for the production of high-octane gasoline from straight run light naphtha on a Pt containing HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst substantially as herein described with reference to the examples accompanying this specification.<br><br><br></td>
