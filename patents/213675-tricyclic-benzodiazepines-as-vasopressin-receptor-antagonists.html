ANTAGONISTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This patent application claims priority from provisional patent application Serial Number 60/116,358 filed on January 19,1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
This invention relates to novel tricyclic vasopressin receptor antagonists. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention interrupt the binding of the peptide hormone vasopressin to its receptors and are therefore useful for treating conditions involving increased vascular resistance and cardiac insufficiency.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Vasopressin is a nonapeptide hormone that is secreted primarily from the posterior pituitary gland. The hormone effects its actions through membrane-bound V-1 and V-2 receptor subtypes. The functions of vasopressin include contraction of uterine, bladder, and smooth muscle; stimulation of glycogen breakdown in the liver; release of corticotropin from the anterior pituitary; induction of platelet aggregation; and central nervous system modulation of behaviors and stress responses. The V-1 receptor mediates the contraction of smooth muscle, and hepatic glycogenolytic and central nervous system effects of vasopressin. The V-2 receptor, presumably found only in the kidney, effects the anttdiuretic actions of vasopressin via stimulation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
Elevated plasma vasopressin levels appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (P. A. Van Zwieten, Progr. Pharmacol C!in. Pharmacol 1990, 7,49). As progress toward the treatment of congestive<br><br>
heart failure, nonapeptide vasopressin V-2 receptor antagonists have induced tow osmolality aquaresis and decreased peripheral resistance in conscious dogs with congestive heart failure (H. Ogawa, J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,3547). In certain pathological states, plasma vasopressin levels may be inappropriately elevated for a given osmolality, thereby resulting in renal water retention and hyponatremia. Hyponatremia, associated with edematous conditions (cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, renal failure), can be accompanied by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Treatment of SIADH-compromised rats with a vasopressin V-2 antagonist has corrected their existing hyponatremia (G. Fujisawa, Kidney int. 1993, 44(1), 19). Due in part to the contractile actions of vasopressin at the V-1 receptor in the vasculature, vasopressin V-1 antagonists have reduced blood pressure as a potential treatment for hypertension. Thus, vasopressin receptor antagonists could be useful as therapeutics in the conditions of hypertension, congestive heart failure/cardiac insufficiency, coronary vasospasm, cardiac ischemia, liver cirrhosis, renal vasospasm, renal failure, cerebral edema and ischemia, stroke, thrombosis, and water retention.<br>

The utility of the compounds to treat disorders of increased vascular resistance can be determined according to the procedures described herein. The present invention, therefore provides, a method of treating vascular resistance disorders in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering any of the compounds as defined herein in a quantity effective to treat vascular resistance disorders. A compound may be administered to a patient in need of treatment by any conventional route of administration including, but not limited to<br>
19<br><br>
oral, nasal, sublingual, ocutar, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.).<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or more compounds of formula (I) or (II) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g. oral or parenteral such as intramuscular). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excioients. published by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.<br>
Methods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions have been described in numerous publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets. Second Edition. Revised and Expanded. Volumes 1-3, edited by Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications. Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems. Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.<br>
In preparing a pharmaceutiacl composition of the present invention in liquid dosage form for oral, topical and parenteral administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid dosage forms, such as suspensions (i.e. colloids, emulsions and dispersions) and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, dispersants, flocculation agents, thickeners, pH control agents (i.e. buffers), osmotic agents, coloring agents, flavors, fragrances, preservatives (i.e. to control microbial growth, etc.) and a<br>
20<br><br>
liquid vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be required for each liquid dosage form.<br>
In solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, granules, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills and tablets (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, glidants, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated, gelatin coated, film coated or enteric coated by standard techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.03 mg to 100 mg/kg (preferably from about 0.1-30 mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.1-300 mg/kg/day (preferably about 1-50 mg/kg/day and more preferably about 0.03 to 10 mg/kg/day). Preferably, for the method of treating vascular resistance disorders described in the present invention using any of the compounds as defined herein, the dosage form will contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier containing between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg, more preferably about 5 to 50 mg, of the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, sterile parenteral solutions<br>
21<br><br>
or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for administration by oral, intranasal, sublingual. intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal, inhalation or insufflation means. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection.<br>
For preparing solid pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents and gildants. Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, starch (i.e. com, wheat, or potato starch, which may be hydrolized), lactose (granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-based diluents (confectioner's sugar, sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent invert sugar, sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent cornstarch and magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL™ microcrystalline cellulose available from FMC Corp.), dicalctum phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, calcium lactate trihydrate and the tike. Suitable binders and adhesives include, but are not limited to accacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose, gelatin, glucose, starch, and celiulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethycelluiose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropytcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e. alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose p.e. TYLOSEmavailab!e from Hoechst Celanese], polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch) and the like. Suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (com, potato, etc.). sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium aluminum silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose and microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. corn starch, etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum),<br>
22<br><br>
cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and antiadherents include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium and sodium), stearic acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride, DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium lauryl sutfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate and the like. Suitable gild ants include, but are not limited to, talc, cornstarch, silica (i.e. CAB-O-S1L™ silica available from Cabot, SYLOID™ silica available from W.R. Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL™ silica available from Degussa) and the like. Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide a accurate, appropriate dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.<br>
Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the pharmaceutical active of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c)dry blending. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills containing the novel compositions may also be formulated In multilayer tablets or pills to provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A<br>
23<br><br>
variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate (i.e. cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimetllitate), polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyf methytcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers, methacrylate and methyl methacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release tablets may also be made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or insoluble substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding agents) or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may incorporate the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, camauba wax, cetyi alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids metallic soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate, coat, entrap or otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a prolonged or sustained release product.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not limited to aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar, alginate (i.e. propylene alginate, sodium atginate and the like), guar, karaya, locust bean, pectin, tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellulosics such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcetlulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e. carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene glycol; clays such as bentonrte, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin or the like. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to sodium docusate, sodium lauryl sutfate, polysorbate, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, polysorbate 20,<br>

Suitable preservatives include but are not limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl), sorbic acid, thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzole acid, chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the liquid vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with the suspending agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty esters and oils liquid vehicles are best used with suspending agents such as low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite, water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming polymers and the like. Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols, polyols and glycols are best used with suspending agents such as higher HLB surfactants, clays silicates, gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Liquid forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches the composition of which are well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
25<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilameilar vesicles, muitiiameilar vesicles and the like.

The compounds may be prepared In racemic form or individual enanttomers may be prepared either by enantiospecffic synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by<br>
26<br><br>
standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>

SCHEME AA<br><br>
The compounds of the invention wherein X is O and Y is methylene may be prepared as shown in Scheme AB. Aziridine AB1 was protected by the action of benzyl chloroformate to afford AB2, and then reacted with 2-chloroethanol to give serine derivative AB3. Compound AB3 was.deprotected by hydrogenolysis and then cyclized in the presence of triethylamine to give morpholine AB5. Acylation of AB5 with 2-nitrobenzoyi chloride followed by iron-mediated reductive cyclization afforded benzodiazepinedione AB7. This bis-lactam was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, resolved as its di-toiuoyl tartrate salt, and acylated with 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoyl chloride to<br>
36<br><br>
produce AB9. Reduction of AB9 with zinc dust followed by acylation with 2-biphenyl carbonyl chloride afforded oxazine 4.<br>
SCHEME AB<br><br>
The compounds of the invention wherein X is S and Y is methylene may be prepared as shown in Scheme AC. Aminoethanethiol and 3-bromopyruvate<br>
37<br><br>
were condensed and cylized to produce AC1. This imine was reduced by sodium cyanoborhydride to give thiazine AC2. Acylation of AC2 with 2-nitrobenzoyl chloride followed by iron-merdated reduction afforded bis-lactam AC4. The intermediate AC4 may be carried forward as exemplified in Scheme AB to give the ftnal, thiazine target compounds.<br>

Synthesis of AC4<br>
A 1 L round-bottom flask was loaded with 2-aminoethanthiol hydrochloride (5.24 g, 0.046 mol), sodium bicarbonate (9.70 g, 2.5 equiv.). 4.0 g of 3 A molecular sieves (activated in the microwave oven) and 200 ml of dry methanol. Indicator - bromocresol purple, 50 mg - was added for pH monitoring, the reaction mixture was flushed by nitrogen and maintained in the nitrogen atmosphere. Ethyl bromopyruvate (10 g, 0.051 mol) was added by syringe pump with such a rate that pH of the reaction mixture was maintained above 6 (dark olive color of the reaction mixture). The addition took about 3 h. Reaction was kept for additional 30 min and sodium cyanoborohydride (5.8 g, 2 equiv.) was added as one portion.<br>
The reaction was acidified to pH 4 and maintained at this pH for 3 h by careful addition of 6.0 M HCI. The color of the reaction mixture was yellow, the pH was monitored with Panpeha® indicator paper. Then the excess of hydrochloric acid was added to get pH 1-2, after gas evolution was ceased the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite® and evaporated in vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 200 ml of water and extracted one time with diethyl ether, the ether solution was discarded. The aqueous solution was made basic (pH 8-9) by addition of 6 N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and extracted 5 times by 50 ml portion of diethyl ether. Combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. Saturation of this solution with gaseous HCI resulted the precipitation of the amino acid ester hydrochloride which was separated by filtration. The white crystals were dried in the vacuum<br>

oven providing 7.9 g (0.037 mol) of AC2 (spectral data are in accord with lit.(U. Larsson and R. Carlson, Acta Chem. Scand. 48(1994), 517-525). In a 100 ml flask, AC2 (8.66 g, 0.041 mol) was dissolved in 50 ml of dioxane containing 5 ml of water. Sodium bicarbonate (12.0 g, 0.14 mol) was added as one portion and 6.82 g (0.036 mol) of 2-nitrobenzoyl chloride was added dropwise, the addition took approximately 45 min. The system was kept 4 h at room temperature, diluted by 200 ml of brine and extracted by ether (4 times by 50 ml). Combined organic fractions were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated providing 12.0 g (0.037 mol) of viscous yellow oil (AC3) which was used without further purification. A 200 ml flask with reflux condenser was loaded with AC3 (12.0 g, 0.037 mol) and 10 g of iron filings. The reaction was refluxed for 4 h and decanted into 500 ml of cold water. After 20 min of stirring the white solid was precipitated. It was filtered, washed with large amount of cold water and dried in the vacuum oven providing AC4 as white solid (7.0 g, 0.028 mol). 1H NMR (DMSO-dB) 2.65 (dd, J=14.4 and 5.8 Hz, 1H) 2.74-2.91 (m, 2H), 3.16 (dt, J=12.6 and 4.7 Hz, 1H), 3.33-3.41 (m, 1H), 4.19 (dd, J=9.9 and 5.8 Hz, 1H), 4.58 (dd, J 14.1 and 4.3 Hz. 1H), 7.11 (d, J 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.25 (t, J=7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.54 (t, J 7.2 Hz, 1H), 7.80 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H);MS m/e 249 (MH*).<br>

Example 50 IN VITRO RECOMBINANT VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAY.<br>
Compounds were assessed for their ability to displace 3H-arginine vasopressin from the human V-1 or V-2 receptor in HEK-293 cells. Assay buffer is 50 mM Tris-CI, 5 mM MgCI2,0.1 % BSA (pH 7.5) containing 5 ug/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 50 ug/ml bacitracin, and 1 mM Pefabloc. 3H-vasopressin is 3H-arginine-8-vasopressin (68.5Ci/mmol, final concentration in assay is 0.65-0.75nM). Into wells of 96-well round bottom polypropylene plates were added buffer, test compound, membrane (containing cloned human V-1 or V-2 receptor), and 3H-vasopressin. The reaction plates were allowed to sit at room temperature for one hour. The samples were filtered through Unrfilter GF/C plates (presoaked in 0.3 polyethyieneimine). The plates were washed 5 times with cold physiological saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. After drying, the bottom of the filter plates were sealed and 0.025 ml of Microscint-20 was added to each filter. The top of the plate was sealed, and the plate was counted. Non-specific binding was determined by the addition of 1.25 uM arginine-8-vasopressin in those wells.<br>
Example 51 REVERSAL OF VASOPRESSIN-INDUCED HYPERTENSION IN RATS.<br>
The anti-hypertensive activity of compounds was screened in an anesthetized model of vasopressin-induced hypertension. Male Long Evans, normotensive rats of between 350 and 450 g in body weight were anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, ip) and maintained throughout the procedure with an ip infusion of 10 mg/kg/hr. Arginine vasopressin was infused at 30 ng/kg/min,<br>

iv, to induce a stable hypertensive state (ca. 50 mmHg increase in mean arterial blood pressure). Compounds of interest were administered in an ascending dose fashion and the maximum decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was recorded. An ED50 was determined from the linear portion of the dose-response relationship for each animal.<br>
This model was modified slightly to assess the bioavailability of compounds of interest. Rather than dosing the animals iv in an ascending dose fashion, a single dose per animal was administered directly into the duodenum. The anti-hypertensive effects were then monitored for 60 minutes and the maximum percent reversal was calculated.<br>
