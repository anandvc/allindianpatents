DETERMINING A PREDICTED PERFORMACE<br>
OF A NAVIGATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to navigation systems, and more particularly, to navigation<br>
satellite systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) transmits ranging and other<br>
signals, which are used by land, sea, and air users to determine a three-dimensional<br>
position, a velocity and a time of day. The GNSS includes a network of satellites to<br>
transmit the signals to users. One example of a GNSS is the Global Positioning System<br>
(GPS). GPS includes a network of 24 or more satellites, called GPS satellites, which<br>
operate in medium earth orbit.<br>
The position solutions that GNSS users determine are inaccurate to some extent,<br>
due to factors such as errors in satellite ephemeris data, satellite clock drift, ionosphere<br>
and troposphere delays, multi-path signals, and receiver noise. In order to determine<br>
how large the inaccuracies in their position solutions could be, GNSS users may compute<br>
integrity bounds, which are high-assurance bounds for the maximum possible distance<br>
errors in their position solutions. Integrity bounds constrain the amount of uncertainty in<br>
the position solutions determined by GNSS users. Because the probability is<br>
exceedingly small that the errors in a GNSS user's position solution could be greater than<br>
the integrity bounds, users are virtually guaranteed that their actual positions are within<br>
the integrity-bounded distances of the position solutions that they determine using the<br>
GNSS. In general, a navigation system with more integrity allows users to compute<br>
smaller integrity bounds, which more closely bound the possible errors, and thus reduce<br>
the uncertainty in users' determined positions. The level of integrity provided by a<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
GNSS itself may be insufficient for users to determine integrity bounds that are<br>
sufficiently small to meet the requirements for some applications, such as aircraft<br>
navigation.<br>
Other systems called augmentation systems generate correction and integrity<br>
data, and broadcast the data to users. Users employ the data from the augmentation<br>
systems to supplement the data that they receive from the GNSS, in order to increase the<br>
accuracy and integrity of their position solutions. The correction data generated by the<br>
augmentation system are adjustments that compensate for some of the errors introduced<br>
by factors such as those listed above. Users employ the correction data in order to<br>
increase the accuracy of their position solutions. The integrity data include values that<br>
bound the residual errors that may still remain even after correction data are applied.<br>
Users employ the integrity data in order to determine tighter integrity bounds, which<br>
reduce the extent of possible inaccuracies remaining in their position solutions.<br>
A typical augmentation system for use with GPS includes one or more reference<br>
stations with GPS receivers that receive GPS data from the GPS satellites. The precise<br>
locations of the reference station receivers are known. A master control station receives<br>
the GPS data collected by the reference stations and determines for each GPS satellite the<br>
bias between the expected range to the satellite, based on the known locations of the<br>
reference station receivers, and the observed range to the satellite, determined using the<br>
GPS data. The master control station also monitors the performance of the GPS satellites<br>
and reports anomalies to users, thereby providing increased integrity for GPS users. The<br>
master control station generates correction and integrity data that are broadcast to users..<br>
One known type of augmentation system is the satellite-based augmentation<br>
system (SB AS). Atypical SB AS includes a set of reference stations with GPS receivers<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
at locations throughout the wide geographic area serviced by the SBAS. The correction<br>
and integrity data generated by the SBAS master control station are transmitted to one or<br>
more geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites for broadcast to users throughout the<br>
wide area on the same frequency and in a similar format to GPS satellites. This method<br>
allows signals from the SBAS GEO and the GPS satellites both to be received by the<br>
user's GPS receiver, and has the added benefit of providing the SBAS GEO satellites as<br>
additional ranging sources to improve availability. Because the SBAS service area is<br>
limited by the footprints of the SBAS GEO satellites (which span approximately +/- 76<br>
degrees in longitude and latitude) and the quantity and locations of the SBAS reference<br>
stations distributed throughout the service area, a single SBAS may provide service to<br>
users throughout an entire nation or continent.<br>
Another known type of augmentation system is the ground-based augmentation<br>
system (GBAS). Atypical GBAS includes a set of reference stations with GPS receivers<br>
located within the local area (e.g., 20 or 30 mile radius) serviced by the GBAS. The<br>
GBAS master control station generates correction and integrity data, which are broadcast<br>
to users in the immediate vicinity of the GBAS via a VHF data link. Because the GBAS<br>
service area is limited by the coverage area of the VHF transmitter and by the localized<br>
distribution of its reference stations, a single GBAS may be used only within a local area,<br>
such as around an airport. Since the GBAS operates in a local area only, it may provide<br>
more accurate correction data and more tightly bounded integrity data for that area, and it<br>
may alert users to fault conditions more quickly than an SBAS that provides service in<br>
the same area.<br>
A farther known type of augmentation system, which does not use reference<br>
stations at fixed locations, is the air-based augmentation system (ABAS). The ABAS<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
typically uses only the user's own GPS receiver to receive the GPS data from GPS<br>
satellites, and it may also supplement the GPS data with data from other equipment, such<br>
as an inertial navigation system (INS). The ABAS uses the Receiver Autonomous<br>
Integrity Monitoring (RAM) method to perform integrity monitoring. Since RAIM is<br>
based on comparing the results achieved using different combinations of GPS satellites,<br>
the ABAS requires more GPS satellites in view than the minimum four required for basic<br>
position fixing. Hence, the ABAS gains integrity at the expense of possibly reduced<br>
availability.<br>
Authorization for using a GNSS for aircraft navigation is granted by Government<br>
and international organizations, which define requirements for different GNSS<br>
navigation services that may be used for different types of aircraft navigation (e.g., for<br>
different phases of flight). Some GNSS navigation services are supported by the GNSS<br>
alone, others are supported by the GNSS supplemented with an augmentation system,<br>
such as an SBAS or GBAS. The requirements for each type of GNSS navigation service<br>
specify limit thresholds for integrity bounds, which constrain the maximum errors in user<br>
position solutions that are allowable when using that type of navigation service. A<br>
navigation service is available for a user (i.e., it is approved for use) when the user is able<br>
to determine that the integrity bounds are not greater than the threshold limit defined for<br>
that service. For example, the requirements for the GNSS navigation service for<br>
Category 1 aircraft landings specify that the integrity bound for a user's horizontal<br>
position solution be no greater than 40 meters, and the integrity bound for the user's<br>
vertical position solution be no greater than 10 meters.<br>
The magnitudes of the integrity bounds determined by a user are dependent on<br>
several factors, including the locations of GNSS satellites relative to the user, the current<br>
.4.<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
performance of the GNSS and the augmentation system (if applicable), and<br>
environmental conditions (e.g., troposphere and ionosphere). These factors typically<br>
change over time and vary by user location. It is typical for the integrity bounds<br>
determined by the same user at different times to vary, even if the user remains at the<br>
same location. It is also typical for the integrity bounds determined at the same time by<br>
users at different locations to be different. At any time, a GNSS navigation service may<br>
be available to users at some locations (those whose integrity bounds are within the<br>
required thresholds), but unavailable to users at other locations (those whose integrity<br>
bound exceed the required thresholds).<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one aspect, a method for determining a predicted performance of a navigation<br>
augmentation system includes determining a normal performance of the navigation<br>
augmentation system and determining a predicted performance of the navigation<br>
augmentation system based on determining the normal performance.<br>
In another aspect, a system for determining a predicted performance of a<br>
navigation augmentation system includes a long-term monitor for determining a normal<br>
performance of the navigation augmentation system and a short-term monitor for<br>
determining a predicted performance of the navigation augmentation system based on the<br>
normal performance of the navigation augmentation system.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention is an article comprising a machine-readable<br>
medium that stores executable instructions for determining a predicted performance of a<br>
navigation augmentation system. The instructions cause a machine to determine a<br>
normal performance of the navigation augmentation and to determine a predicted<br>

performance of the navigation augmentation system over a second time interval based on<br>
determining the normal performance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The ability to predict how navigation systems and navigation augmentation<br>
systems will perform in the future is useful, because predictions of navigation system<br>
performance may be used to generate navigation service prediction forecasts, which<br>
specify when and where navigation services will and will not be available to users.<br>
Warnings of upcoming navigation service outages may be used to avoid disruptive and<br>
possibly unsafe conditions when navigation services become unavailable to users relying<br>
on them for ongoing navigation. Navigation service prediction forecasts allow users to<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
adjust their navigation plans in advance, in order to avoid attempting to use a navigation<br>
service in a location when it is expected to he unavailable.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a navigation environment 10 with Global Positioning System<br>
(GPS) and satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) includes GPS satellites (e.g.,<br>
GPS satellite 12a and GPS satellite 12b) and geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites<br>
(e.g., GEO satellite 14a and GEO satellite 14b) for one or more SBAS-type<br>
augmentation system. Users of SBAS-augmented GPS receive and process the GPS data<br>
broadcast by GPS satellites 12a and 12b that are in view (i.e., within line of sight), and<br>
also the SBAS data broadcast by SBAS GEO satellites 14a and 14b that are in view. The<br>
navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 is used to monitor and to predict the<br>
performance of GPS and the SBAS's. The navigation monitoring and prediction system<br>
20 processes the same GPS data and SBAS data that are broadcast to users by the GPS<br>
satellites 12a and 12b and the SBAS GEO satellites 14a and 14b. The navigation<br>
monitoring and prediction system 20 uses the GPS data and SBAS data to determine the<br>
current GPS and SBAS performance, and to determine where GPS and SBAS navigation<br>
services are currently available. The navigation monitoring and prediction system 20<br>
also uses the GPS data and SBAS data to predict future GPS and SBAS performance,<br>
and to predict when and where GPS and SBAS navigation service will be available in the<br>
future.<br>
The navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 uses the GPS data broadcast by<br>
GPS satellites 12a and 12b and the SBAS data broadcast by the SBAS GEO satellites<br>
14a and 14b that it receives from a single data source to determine the current and<br>
predicted future availability of GPS and SBAS navigation services at locations<br>
throughout the wide geographic service areas covered by the SBAS GEO satellites.<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
The navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 described herein is for use<br>
with an SBAS; however, the navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 may be<br>
used with other types of augmentation systems. Even though the navigation monitoring<br>
and prediction system 20 described herein is for use with GPS, the navigation monitoring<br>
and prediction system 20 may be used with other types or multiple types of GNSS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 includes a<br>
data collection module 24, a satellite prediction module 34, an integrity prediction<br>
module 44, a frame generator module 56, a user integrity evaluation module 58, a service<br>
availability monitor module 60 and a user interface 62. The navigation monitoring and<br>
prediction system 20 generates predictions of GPS and SBAS performance, and<br>
predictions of the availability of GPS and SBAS navigation services, for times<br>
throughout a prediction time window (e.g., from the current time to 72 hours in the<br>
future). The prediction time window is divided into prediction time frames of equal<br>
length (e.g., one minute). The navigation monitoring and prediction system 20 generates<br>
predictions for each prediction time frame in the prediction time window.<br>
The data collection module 24 receives GPS data and SBAS data from a source<br>
(e.g., an SBAS-compatible GPS receiver). The GPS data, which include ephemeris data<br>
(i.e., orbital parameters) and health status data for each GPS satellite, are routed to the<br>
satellite prediction module 34. The SBAS data include integrity data broadcast by each<br>
SBAS GEO satellite, consisting of user differential range error indicator (UDREI) data<br>
and clock ephemeris covariance matrix (MT28) data for each GPS and SBAS GEO<br>
satellite, and grid ionospheric vertical error indicator (GIVEI) data for each ionospheric<br>
grid point (IGP) in the IGP mask for each SBAS GEO satellite. The data collection<br>
module 24 includes an SBAS data input buffer (IB) 26, in which it stores the SBAS data<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
from each SBAS GEO satellite. The data from each SBAS GEO satellite are processed<br>
and stored separately in the SBAS data input buffer 26. The SBAS data input buffer 26<br>
holds data for times throughout the collection time interval, which extends from some<br>
time (e.g., 10 minutes) before the current time to some time (e.g., 10 minutes) after the<br>
current time. Each SBAS data value is stored in the SBAS data input buffer 26 for the<br>
time interval of validity appropriate for that type of data. Degradation of the data values<br>
stored in the SBAS data input buffer 26 is performed if new SBAS data values are not<br>
received from an SBAS GEO satellite within the expected reporting intervals.<br>
Periodically, at the end of each integrity monitoring interval (e.g., one minute), the data<br>
collection module 24 processes the data that it has collected in the SBAS data input<br>
buffer 26. The data collection module 24 examines the sequence of UDREI and MT28<br>
values collected for each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite throughout the integrity<br>
monitoring interval, and the sequence of GIVEI values collected for each IGP, and it<br>
reduces each sequence of values to a single representative UDREI, MT28, or GIVEI<br>
value for that integrity monitoring interval. The current integrity values, consisting of<br>
the representative UDREI, MT28, and GIVEI values for that integrity monitoring<br>
interval, are routed to the integrity prediction module 44.<br>
The data collection module 24 provides active GEOs data, identifying the SBAS<br>
GEO satellites from which data have been received, to the satellite prediction module 34,<br>
which monitors the operational status of the SBAS GEO satellites.<br>
The satellite prediction module 34 monitors GPS and SBAS GEO satellite<br>
performance, and generates predictions for GPS and SBAS GEO satellite performance<br>
throughout the prediction time window. The satellite prediction module 34 includes a<br>
satellite outage schedule (OS) database 36 and an ephemeris database (ED) 38. The<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
satellite outage schedule database 36 includes a set of time intervals for each GPS and<br>
SBAS GEO satellite, which indicate the times in the future that the satellite will not be<br>
operational. The ephemeris database 38 includes the most recent ephemeris data<br>
received for each GPS satellite.<br>
The satellite prediction module 34 uses data from the satellite outage schedule<br>
database 36 to predict whether or not each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite will be<br>
operational during each prediction time frame throughout the prediction time window.<br>
When the satellite prediction module 34 receives updated satellite outage schedule<br>
information, it stores the updated information in the satellite outage schedule database<br>
36, and sends notification to the frame generator module 56 to reevaluate integrity<br>
prediction results for all prediction time frames within the prediction time window that<br>
are affected by the updated outage schedules. Updates to the satellite outage schedule<br>
may be entered directly by a user, through a capability provided by the user interface, or<br>
may be obtained automatically from a connection to or email from a service that provides<br>
information about upcoming satellite outages.<br>
The satellite prediction module 34 monitors the incoming GPS data and active <br>
GEOs data and detects inconsistencies between the actual operational status of GPS and<br>
SBAS GEO satellites and the expected operational status of the satellites, as indicated by<br>
information in the satellite outage schedule database 36. If an unscheduled GPS or<br>
SBAS GEO satellite outage is detected, the satellite prediction module 34 generates<br>
updated satellite operational predictions that override the inaccurate outage schedule, and<br>
it sends notification to the frame generator module 56 to reevaluate integrity prediction<br>
results for all affected prediction time frames, so that the unavailable satellite is excluded<br>
from prediction evaluations. Likewise, if a GPS or SBAS GEO satellite is found to be<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
operational during a time when an outage for it is scheduled, the satellite prediction<br>
module 34 generates updated satellite operational predictions that override the outage<br>
schedule, and it sends notification to the frame generator module 56, so that the<br>
operational satellite is included in prediction evaluations.<br>
The satellite prediction module 34 uses data from the ephemeris database 38 to<br>
predict the location of each GPS and SB AS GEO satellite during each prediction time<br>
frame throughout the prediction time window. When the satellite prediction module 34<br>
receives updated satellite ephemeris data, it stores the data in the ephemeris database 38,<br>
and sends notification to the frame generator module 56 to reevaluate integrity prediction<br>
results for all prediction time frames within the prediction time window that are affected<br>
by the updated ephemeris.<br>
The satellite prediction module 34 monitors the incoming GPS data for new GPS<br>
satellites. When a new GPS satellite is detected, it is added to the satellite outage<br>
schedule database 36 and the ephemeris database 38. The satellite prediction module 34<br>
also times out a GPS satellite when no data from the satellite are received during the<br>
timeout period (e.g., 24 hours). Timed out satellites are removed from the satellite<br>
outage schedule database 36 and the ephemeris database 38. When a GPS satellite is<br>
added or removed, notification is sent to the frame generator module 56 to reevaluate<br>
integrity prediction results for all prediction time frames throughout the entire prediction<br>
period.<br>
The Integrity prediction module 44 monitors integrity data from SBAS GEO<br>
satellites, and generates predictions for the integrity data that the SBAS GEO satellites<br>
will broadcast to users throughout the prediction time window. The integrity data<br>
include user differential range error indicator (UDREI) data and clock ephemeris<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
covariance matrix (MT28) data for each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite, and grid<br>
ionospheric vertical error indicator (GIVEI) data for each ionospheric grid point (IGP) in<br>
the IGP mask for each SBAS GEO satellite. The integrity prediction module 44 includes<br>
a long-term monitor 46, and may also include a short-term monitor 48.<br>
The long-term monitor 46 generates a nominal database (ND)50, which includes<br>
a full set of the normal integrity data values for each SBAS GEO satellite (UDREI and<br>
MT28 values for each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite, and GIVEI values for each IGP).<br>
The long-term monitor 46 derives the normal integrity data values for each SBAS GEO<br>
satellite by monitoring the integrity data that the SBAS GEO satellite has generated in<br>
the past. The data in the nominal database 50 are the integrity data values that have been<br>
generated most consistently by the SBAS GEO satellite, up through the recent past. If<br>
the conditions in the near future are similar to those in the recent past, it is likely that the<br>
SBAS GEO satellite will continue to generate the same integrity data values consistently<br>
in the future that it generated consistently in the past. If conditions in the near future are<br>
expected to be normal (i.e., resembling the conditions that occurred consistently in the<br>
recent past), the same normal integrity data values in the nominal database 50, which are<br>
based on past SBAS performance, may be used as the values for predictions of future<br>
SBAS performance.<br>
The nominal database 50 includes integrity data values for each integrity<br>
monitoring interval (e.g., one minute) throughout an entire sidereal day, which is slightly<br>
less than 24 hours. The nominal database 50 includes a value for each type of integrity<br>
data, for each SBAS GEO satellite, for each integrity monitoring interval in the sidereal<br>
day. The orbital period of GPS satellites is one-half of a sidereal day, so the GPS<br>
satellites are in nearly the same locations relative to the earth at the same time offset<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
within each sidereal day. An SBAS is likely to generate similar integrity values during<br>
the same integrity monitoring interval over subsequent sidereal days, because the same<br>
conditions of GPS satellite locations relative to the SBAS reference stations recur during<br>
that same interval in each sidereal day.<br>
The long-term monitor 46 continuously monitors the integrity data generated by<br>
SBAS GEO satellites, and updates the nominal database 50 as necessary, to keep the<br>
normal integrity data in the database consistent with the actual past performance of the<br>
SBAS. Because the nominal database 50 includes integrity data values that SBAS GEO<br>
satellites are likely to generate in the future, the long-term monitor distinguishes<br>
repeatable trends in past SBAS performance from temporary deviations. Values<br>
generated in the past by the SBAS GEO satellites during temporary deviations are not<br>
likely to recur in the future, but values generated consistently by the SBAS GEO<br>
satellites in the past are likely to be generated again in the future. Whenever the nominal<br>
database 50 is updated, the long-term monitor 46 sends notification to the frame<br>
generator module 56 to reevaluate integrity prediction results for all affected prediction<br>
time frames.<br>
The short-term monitor 48 generates an adjusted predictions, which it stores in<br>
the adjusted predictions database (AD) 52. The adjusted predictions are used in place of<br>
the predictions based on normal integrity values when the short-term monitor 48 detects<br>
that unexpected deviations from normal SBAS performance are occurring. The short-<br>
term monitor 48 continuously monitors the integrity data generated by SBAS GEO<br>
satellites, and compares the integrity data currently being generated to the corresponding<br>
normal integrity data values in the nominal database 50. If it detects unexpected<br>
deviations from normal SBAS performance, which are not consistent with the schedule<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
of GPS and SB AS GEO satellite outages maintained in the satellite prediction module<br>
34, it generates adjusted predictions and stores them in the adjusted prediction database<br>
52.<br>
The short-term monitor 48 detects when SBAS performance begins to deviate<br>
from its expected normal performance, but it may not reliably predict when in the future<br>
those deviations will end. Thus, the short-term monitor 48 generates adjusted predictions<br>
for the short-term relative to the current time. Deviations that are occurring currently are<br>
likely to persist during the immediate future, but it is less certain that the deviations will<br>
continue to persist into the more distant future.<br>
The adjusted prediction database 52 generated by the short-term monitor 48<br>
includes the same kinds of integrity data values for each SBAS GEO satellite as the<br>
nominal database 50 generated by the long-term monitor, including UDREI and MT28<br>
values for each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite, and GWEI values for each IGP. The data<br>
in the adjusted prediction database 52 are stored for prediction time frames (unlike the<br>
data in the nominal database 50, which are stored for integrity monitoring intervals).<br>
Whenever the adjusted prediction database 52 is updated, the short-term monitor 46<br>
sends notification to the frame generator module 56 to reevaluate integrity prediction<br>
results for all affected prediction time frames.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the integrity prediction module 44 may use a process,<br>
for example, a process 70, to predict the future performance of the navigation<br>
augmentation system for some time interval.  The long-term monitor 46 (FIG. 2) may<br>
use an exemplary subprocess 80, and the short-term monitor 48 (FIG. 2) may use an<br>
exemplary subprocess 100. If the short-term monitor 48 (FIG. 2) generates adjusted<br>
predictions for the time interval, those adjusted predictions are used; otherwise the<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
normal integrity values from the corresponding integrity monitoring interval in the<br>
nominal database 46 (FIG. 2) are used for the predicted values.<br>
The long-term monitor 46 (FIG. 2) uses the subprocess 80 (FIG. 4) to monitor the<br>
navigation augmentation system performance over an extended past time period, and to<br>
derive the normal integrity values that are stored in the nominal database 50 (FIG. 2).<br>
Subprocess 80 compares the current integrity values obtained from the data collection<br>
module 24 (FIG. 2) to the normal integrity values in the nominal database 50 (FIG. 2) for<br>
the same integrity monitoring interval (82). The current integrity values include the<br>
integrity values generated during the most recent integrity monitoring interval.<br>
Subprocess 80 stores the current integrity values in data structures used to hold the<br>
integrity values received during the past several days (e.g., 5 days). Subprocess 80<br>
determines if there is a deviation between the current integrity values and the normal<br>
integrity values already stored in the nominal database 50 (84). If there is a deviation,<br>
subprocess 80 examines the normal integrity values stored for the past several days and<br>
determines if the deviation has been repeating consistently (86). If the deviation has<br>
repeated consistently, subprocess 80 updates the normal integrity values (88).<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the short-term monitor 48 uses an exemplary subprocess 100<br>
to detect deviations from the normal performance of the navigation augmentation<br>
system, and to generate adjusted predictions that a projection of those deviations<br>
throughout some time range into the future. The subprocess 100 monitors the current<br>
integrity values obtained from the data collection module 24 (FIG. 2) and compares them<br>
to the normal integrity values stored in the nominal database 50 (FIG. 2) to determine if<br>
there are any deviations (102). Subprocess 100 predicts a likely progression of the<br>
deviations by matching the deviation characteristics against a set of known deviation<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
patterns (104). Subprocess 100 generates adjusted data for intervals in the near future<br>
throughout the predicted extent of the deviation (106). Subprocess 100 also monitors<br>
deviations in progress for which adjusted predictions have been generated (108).<br>
Subprocess 100 examines the current integrity values to determine if the deviation has<br>
ceased (110). If the deviation has ceased, subprocess 100 rescinds any remaining<br>
adjusted prediction data with respect to that deviation (112). If the deviation is still in<br>
progress, and if the deviation is a type of deviation for which the end time is not bounded<br>
(114), subprocess 100 extends the duration of the prediction data with respect to that<br>
deviation (116).<br>
The types of SBAS performance deviations that the short-term monitor 48<br>
detects, and for which it generates adjusted prediction data, include deviations caused by<br>
conditions such as ionospheric storms, SBAS reference station outages, and temporarily<br>
elevation of residual error bounds by SBAS internal integrity monitors.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 3, process 70 determines if adjusted predictions exists<br>
(120). If adjusted predictions do exist, process 70 uses the adjusted predictions (122). If<br>
the adjusted predictions do not exist, process 70 uses normal values for the predictions<br>
(124).<br>
Process 70 may be used to predict future performance of the navigation<br>
augmentation system continuously so that a rolling window, for example, from the<br>
present time out 24 hrs, may be continuously updated to give users a perspective of the<br>
navigation augmentation system's behavior in the near Mure.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2, the frame generator module 56 assembles frame data,<br>
which include all the data needed to determine integrity bounds for GPS and SBAS users<br>
at any time within the prediction time window. Frame data assembled by the frame<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
generator module 56 are routed to the user integrity evaluation module 58. The frame<br>
data include satellite data obtained from the satellite prediction module 34, consisting of<br>
the location and health status of each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite. The frame data also<br>
include integrity data obtained from the integrity prediction module 44, consisting of the<br>
UDREI and MT28 values for each GPS and SBAS GEO satellite, as generated by each<br>
SBAS GEO satellite, and the GIVEI of each IGP, as generated by each SBAS GEO<br>
satellite. The frame generator module 56 includes a frame schedule database 57 that<br>
indicates which time frames throughout the prediction time window need to be<br>
evaluated. The frame generator module 56 uses the frame schedule database 57 to<br>
ensure that integrity evaluation results are generated for all prediction time frames that<br>
need to be evaluated.<br>
The user integrity evaluation module 58 uses the frame data received from the<br>
frame generator module 56 to calculate GPS and SBAS integrity bounds at a large<br>
number of locations (e.g., 100,000) throughout a wide geographical area. Each location<br>
represents an emulated GPS and SBAS user. Because integrity bounds vary for users at<br>
different locations, the integrity bounds for each emulated user are calculated separately,<br>
using the same algorithms that would be used by actual GPS and SBAS receivers at the<br>
user's location. Using emulated users to calculate integrity bounds is a practical<br>
approach for determining the integrity bounds for users distributed throughout a wide<br>
geographic area, compared to an approach requiring installing, controlling, and<br>
monitoring a large number of actual GPS and SBAS receivers distributed at user<br>
locations throughout the area. The integrity bounds computed for all of the emulated<br>
users are routed to the service availability monitor module 60.<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/086071	PCT/US2005/045613<br>
Computing the integrity bounds for a large number of emulated users may require<br>
a substantial amount of processing time. In order to increase the throughput of the<br>
integrity bound calculations, the system may include more than one user Integrity<br>
evaluation module 58 that execute in parallel on separate processors.<br>
The service availability monitor module 60 determines, based on the integrity<br>
bounds received, the availability of each of the several GPS and SB AS based navigation<br>
services at a given time (e.g., past, present, or future) at locations throughout the<br>
geographical area.  The service availability monitor module 60 manages a monitored<br>
area database 64, which includes definitions of geographic areas (e.g., locations, regions,<br>
routes or flight plans) that are monitored for availability of GPS and SBAS navigation<br>
services. The service availability monitor module 60 it detects the time and duration of<br>
GPS and SBAS navigation service availability outages that are predicted to occur within<br>
each of the monitored areas. Information about the predicted navigation services outages<br>
for all monitored areas is stored in the service outage database 66.<br>
A user interface 60 renders displays and generates reports such as geographic<br>
contour displays showing data such as integrity bounds and navigation service<br>
availability at different times throughout a wide geographic area, and list displays<br>
showing data such as predicted navigation service availability outages for different sets<br>
of monitored areas. The user interface 60 may include capabilities such as to update<br>
GPS and GEO satellite outage schedules, and to support generation of NOTAMS (i.e.,<br>
official warnings of upcoming navigation service availability outages). The user<br>
interface 60 may be a monitor or a printer, for example.<br>
