Accordingly there is provided a new three cone air diffuser made up of normally in Steel or Aluminium comprising of a Central Plate or Central Cone, Intermediate Cone and an Outer frame which is fitted with each other by means of at least a pair of spring loaded pipes fitted to each cone and facilitating easy removal of each cone from each other.<br>
The Outer frame made out of a piece of sheet, generally Aluminium or Steel framed with<br><br>
a flanged neck at the center with variable hole size to fit different sizes of ducts inlet, normally circular but can be square or other shape as matching with the duct contains or more straps for fixing of the spring loaded pipes/rods of bell shaped construction on the back of the inner cone assembly comprising of inner cone and the centre cone.<br>
The cone assembly comprising of intermediate cone and central cone fitted with each other by spring loaded assembly.<br>
The central cone made up of single sheet attached with a bracket to hold the inner cone fitted by means of welding, spot welding, brazing or riveting with or without in- between plate for extra strength or by any other means of fixing purpose of holding the centre cone from the intermediate cone at a particular distance, generally fixed but can be made variable by adjusting the height of the bracket, spring loaded to hold in the place bracket, spring loaded to hold in the same place to make able to remove the assembly when required quickly and easily. The outer frame of the diffuser has a neck on the backside generally round in shape with a vertical collar, which fixes with the opening of the duct. From the vertical collar, the outer extends horizontally and then forming a bell like shape and then having a horizontal flat flange at the earlier edge. The outer edge is generally in square shape but can be blended to form different shapes like square or others. The flat surface of the outer frame containing one or more pains of projections which can be used as an additional support to the diffuser for having to the duct or ceiling. It also comprises at least a pair of slots, which are used for fixing brackets for fixing of inner cone assembly.<br>
The intermediate cone is made up of sheet of required size, normally Aluminium of Steel is having an opening, generally square or round at the centre, again a bell shaped structure but with lesser angle than the outer frameand a flat edge outwardly projected at the outer side of the opening which is generally of square shape. It contains at least two pairs of slots for fixing of the centre cone to forms the cone assembly.<br><br>

narrow portion so that the spring urges against the bell portion and the outer framing of the intermediate cone placed over to  fix intermediate cone over the inner cone.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention:<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to figures 1 to 13 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to figures 2 to 9 the new 3 cone Diffuser consisting of acentral cone (1), an-intermediate cone (2) and outer cone or outer frame (3) placed one above the other in a space apart relationships having same vertical axis (14) wherein the front central cone (1) made from single piece is attached to the intermediate cone (2) by means of fixing bracket (8) which is welded on the back of the front central cone ; the said fixing bracket is welded, brazed or riveted on the back of the central cone. The bracket may be attachedto a metal plate, which is attached-to the central cone. The bracket (8) is also a single piece made from metal having four legs two at front and two at the back. The back legs are provided with springs (9) the legs, are pushed in the grooves of the flanges (17) of the small flat vertical flange (13) on the back of intermediate cone; the front two legs go into the grooves wherein the springs are urging against the flange projected portion thereby the central cone is held in position at the below of the intermediate cone; while dismantling the bracket is pushed back and the spring is compressed therefore the front legs come out of the grooves thereby removing the bracket with central cone from the intermediate cone; the intermediate cone (2) is also made from single piece of metal having central opening (15) with outwardly projected flanges the said flange is provided with two sets of grooves for fixing the central cone bracket and other to sides are welded with pipes/rods (6) with spring wound on the end of two pipes. The said pipes are used to fix the outer frame (3) in the brackets provided (5) four in number engaged in the slots (12) at the inner side of the outer most frame thereby retaining the intermediate cone below the outer cone by means of pipes/rods (6) with biasing means thereby fixing it easily by pushing one sides of the rod into the grooves of the bracket and the other side the pipe goes in the bracket, against the spring thereby while dismantling the spring of the<br><br>
pipe is compressed to remove the free end of the pipe from the grooves of the bracket thereby dismantling the intermediate cone from the outer frame.<br>
3 Cone Diffuser comprising a central cone (1), an intermediate cone (2) and outer cone or outer frame(3) placed one above the other in a spaced apart relationships having same vertical axis (14); the said central cone (1) at the back is provided with bracket (8) spot welded or brazed or rivetted to hold the centre cone which is fixed on the intermediate cone in the central opening (15) having outwardly projected flanges (16) having holes/slots (17) to accommodate the front (18) and back(19) support of the bracket; the said back-support is provided with springs (9) for easy removal of the bracket, thereby dismantling the central cone easily; the intermediate cone (2) on its outer flanges of the central opening (15) provided withpipe/rod- (6) with spring (7) is welded or brazed so as to fix the intermediate cone on the brackets (5) provided in the inner part of the outer cone so as to dismantle the intermediate cone by a slight, pressing of the biasing means (7), the said outer cone (3) having central inlet (20) with flanged portion outwardly directed (4) to connect with theducting or damper; said inlet is adjustable as per the requirement of the ducting; the central cone is further provided with a hole (10) which may be covered by some removable piece to adjust the aperture of the damper.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a new three cone air diffuser comprisingas 3 cone diffuser is made up of normally in Steel or Aluminium comprising of a Central Plate or Central Cone, Intermediate Cone and an Outer frame which is fitted with each other by means of at least a pair of spring loaded pipes fitted to each cone and facilitating easy removal of each cone from each other.<br>
The Outer frame (3) made out of a piece of sheet, generally Aluminium or Steel framed with a flanged neck at the centre with variable size to fit different sizes of ductsinlet/outlet, normally circular but can be square or other shape as matching with the duct.<br>
The cone assembly comprising of intermediate cone (s) and central cone fitted with each other by spring loaded assembly.<br><br>
The Inner cone made up of single sheet attached with a bracket to hold the inner cone fitted by means of welding, spot welding, brazing or rivetting or any other means of fixing purpose of holding the centre cone from the intermediate cone at a particular distance, generally fixed but can be made variable by adjusting the height of the bracket, spring loaded to hold in the place bracket, spring loaded to hold in the same place to make able to remove the assembly when required quickly and easily.<br>
The outer frame (3) of the diffuser has a neck on the backside generally round in shape with a vertical collar (4), which fixes with the opening of the duct. From the vertical collar, the outer extends horizontally and then forming a bell like shape and then havinga horizontal flat flange at the earlier edge. The outer edge is generally in square shape but can be blended to form different shapes like square or others. The flat surface of the outer frame containing, one or more pairs of projections which, can be used as an additional support to the diffuser for fixing to the duct or ceiling. It also comprises at least a pair ofslots 1' (12), which are used for fixing brackets(5) for fixing of inner cone assembly.<br>
The intermediate cone is made up of sheet of required size, normally Aluminium of Steel is having an opening, generally square or round at the centre, again a bell shaped structure but withlesser angle than the outer frame and a flat edge at the outer side which is generally of square shape. It contains at least two pairs of slots for fixing of the centre cone to forms the cone assembly.<br>
