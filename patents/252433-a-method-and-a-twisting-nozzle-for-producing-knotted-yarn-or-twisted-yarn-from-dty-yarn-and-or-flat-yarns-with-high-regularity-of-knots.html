				<td>Method and Twisting Nozzle for Producing Knotted Yarn<br>
The invention pertains to a method for producing knotted yarn or draw twist yarn and/or<br>
flat yarns with a high degree of regularity of the knots by means of air jets, with a yarn<br>
treatment channel as well as blast air that is blown in transverse to the yarn treatment<br>
channel, whereby the blast air forms a double twist for producing the knots in the yarn<br>
transporting direction as well as against the yarn transporting direction. The invention<br>
further pertains to a twisting nozzle for production of knotted yarn with a high degree of<br>
regularity of the knots, with a continuous yarn treatment channel, as well as a blast air<br>
feed channel, whereby the blast air feed channel is aligned to the longitudinal central axis<br>
of the yarn treatment channel.<br>
In the recent past, increasingly finer filaments were produced. These are referred to as<br>
microfilaments, if the denier per filament (dpf) lies between 0.5 and approx. 1.2. The<br>
yarns thus produced are called microfilament yarns. One refers to them as super<br>
microfilament yarns if the dps is 
below, these include also super microfilaments, unless otherwise mentioned. Already<br>
yarns with a dps above 1.2 require careful processing, so that neither the individual<br>
filaments nor the entire yarn break. This applies to a greater extent in the case of<br>
microfilament yarns. In case of microfilament yarns, the bundle of all filaments has an<br>
important significance. Care should be taken that individual filaments do not stray away<br>
and hence pose the danger of breaking. DTY-yarns mean drawn-twist-yarn.<br>
There is a relatively large use of twisted yarns with so-called air twist in the market. The<br>
market indicates two tendencies. In many cases of application, well-structured, strong<br>
and stable knots in all degrees of filament fineness are in demand. The air nozzle has to<br>
be designed for that with respect to all parameters. The situation is different in case of<br>
fine microfilament yarns. With these yarns, fine fabrics are produced that should have a<br>
soft and silk-like feel. Here one can see that the formation of very stable and almost<br>
unreleasable knots could be disadvantageous, in that the knots leave the mark in an<br>
undesirable manner, as a kind of screen, especially on a very fine, single coloured fabrics.<br>
Even though knots are desirable within the yarn processing, they should completely<br>
disappear later while processing the fine yarns into fabrics or other substances. The so-<br>
called knotted yarn is produced by twisting in the twisting nozzle. The knots ensure the<br>
local binding of all filaments and short knot sequences over the entire yarn run. The<br>
objective of twisting is to achieve a high number of knots per meter with uniform<br>
distance between the knots. A yarn treatment channel, with a blast air feed transverse to<br>
the yarn channel, provides the device-specific conditions. The blast air flows away on<br>
both sides of the yarn channel and on account of the almost centric blowing in the yarn<br>
run direction and against the yarn run direction, forms so-called double twists. By taking<br>
the yarn through the corresponding twist zone one obtains the kind of alternative air<br>
movement that is ultimately co-responsible for a repetitive formation of knots with short<br>
interruptions between the knots. The skill lies in finding an optimum solution for the<br>
respective application case between the three yarn quality criteria,<br>
Knot stability;<br>
Number of knots per meter;<br>
Regularity of knot formation,<br>
with specific designing of all dimensions of the yarn channel of a twisting nozzle, as well<br>
as the type of air feeding, air pressure, overfeed and the yarn run velocity. In coarser<br>
filaments having dpf 1.2 - 4, a number of up to 110 knots is desirable and in<br>
microfilament yarns up to 200 per meter of yarn. The air pressure for microfilaments is<br>
approx. 0.5 to 1.5 bar. The overfeed is 3% - 6%. In the state-of-the-art technology, for<br>
fine filaments, 140 points or knots per meter of yarn length are generated. The highest<br>
possible uniformity/regularity of the knots sequence is thereby desirable. It should be<br>
prevented, that knot-free yarn stretches occur, in which one or more knots are<br>
successively missing. The extent of stability tells us, under which tensile forces the knots<br>
again get released. In the simplest method for testing this, the yarn is held between two<br>
hands and stretched slowly or in a jerky manner.<br>
The document DE 197 00 817 shows a special form of twisting nozzle for carpet yarn,<br>
i.e. for very coarse BCF-yarn. It was based on a method for continuous production of<br>
weave-texturized filament yarn in a continuous yarn channel or twisting channel of a<br>
twisting nozzle. The filament yarn is twisted by a blast airflow directed in a transverse<br>
direction into the nozzle that is flowing forwards and backwards out of the yarn channel<br>
and the discharge air of the reversed twist is released in counter-direction to the blast air<br>
feed from the yarn feeding region. As solution it is suggested that two twists with<br>
different strengths get generated in the twisting channel, whereby the forward twist is<br>
designed to be more strongly effective than the reverse twist.<br>
The document DE 37 11 759 is based on finer to average yarns and tries to improve the<br>
process-ability of the yarn in subsequent processing stages, e.g. in looms, drafting<br>
machines and tufting machines. The inventor started off with a twisting device for<br>
twisting multi-filament yarns, which have at least one yarn channel, whereby yarn guides<br>
are arranged at distances from the inlet and outlet of the yarn channel, and the filaments<br>
of one multi-filament yarn can be twisted in the yarn channel by means of compressed air<br>
which can be blown in through a blast nozzle. While running into and running out of the<br>
yarn channel, the yarn experiences a change in direction of less than 90°, and the blowing<br>
angle of the blast nozzle is lesser than 90°. As a new solution, it is suggested that the<br>
yarn guides be arranged in such a way, that the yarn is placed through them in such a way<br>
on the yarn channel, with the compressed air feed switched off, that it stretches in the<br>
yarn channel parallel to its longitudinal direction, and thereby acts at the exit of the at<br>
least one blast nozzle. The distance of the yarn guides from their adjacent yarn channel<br>
openings is maximum 30 mm. The length of the yarn channel for un-crimped multi-<br>
filament yarns is max. 40 mm and for crimped multifilament yam max. 30 mm. The<br>
document DE 37 11 759 is useful at least to the extent, that the knowledge of the positive<br>
effect of a short yarn channel is useful for producing knotted yarn in a wider specialized<br>
world. Concretely, a yarn channel length for texturized or crimped yarns is suggested as<br>
10-28 mm. Especially, the range of 10 mm of yarn channel length is considered as<br>
short.<br>
Latest experience shows that the actually widespread application of air nozzles for<br>
producing knotted yarn is not satisfactory for very fine yarns, particularly in<br>
microfilaments. With respect to fine yarns, particularly in microfilament yarns, in any<br>
case there is a requirement of maximum regularity of the knot sequence; however, in<br>
certain cases of application, only weak, temporarily constant and reversible, i.e. knots<br>
that get released again during yarn processing, are required. The knots should not be<br>
noticeable in the finished fabrics. It has been attempted several times to operate nozzles<br>
of the state-of-the-art technology with lower pressure of the feed air. It is known that<br>
with lower air pressure one gets weaker knots, however with the disadvantage of an often<br>
not acceptable non-uniformity in the strength or stability of the knots, as well as the<br>
distances between the knots.<br>
Recently there is very strong tendency in the market to use so-called microfilament yarns.<br>
The question of uniformity of the knots, as well as at least an adequate stability of the<br>
knots for further processing thereby acquires central importance in many cases of<br>
application. In most cases it is required that the number of knots does not fall<br>
significantly short of the figure of 140 knots/m that can be achieved at the moment; it is<br>
furthermore required that the required pressure for blast air should be reduced, keeping in<br>
view the energy consumption. It is now the task of this invention to find a method as<br>
well as a twisting nozzle, with the help of which even at high yarn run velocity, the above<br>
mentioned quality criteria can be achieved in the production of fine yarns and particularly<br>
microfilament yarns, with the following four objectives:<br>
- Pressure reduction of the blast air;<br>
- Number of knots per meter &gt; 140/m fordpf 
- Adjustable knot stability;<br>
- High uniformity of the knots sequence.<br>
The method as per invention has the feature, that the blast air in the entry region into the<br>
yarn treatment channel is transferred in an air twisting chamber into two strong, steads<br>
air twist flows almost undisturbed by filament bundles.<br>
The twisting nozzle as per the invention has a distinctive feature, that in the mouth region<br>
of the blast air feed channel in the yarn treatment channel, a blast air channel elongation<br>
is formed for creating an air twisting chamber for two opposite steady air twist flows,<br>
whereby the blast air channel elongation protrudes by lesser than 22% of the yarn channel<br>
width, however more than 5%.<br>
With reference to the new invention, two twisting nozzles are known in the state-of-the-<br>
art technology:<br>
- Firstly, these are twisting nozzles with continuous yarn channels, as described in the<br>
introductory part of DE 37 11 759. The typical characteristic thereby is a uniform<br>
continuous yarn channel.<br>
- Secondly, these are twisting nozzles with a yarn-twisting chamber in the region of the<br>
blast air feed into the yarn channel. This is based on the model, that the open individual<br>
filaments of the yarn at the same time require an additional chamber to swing out to the<br>
side and thus generate improved knot stability.<br>
It is interesting that in the first case one achieves a higher number of knots. The<br>
disadvantage however is, that the stability of the knots and the uniformity of the knots<br>
sequence get noticeably worse even on slight reduction of the pressure of the blast air. In<br>
the second case, although the stability of the knots is adequate, the number of knots is not<br>
sufficient for several applications.<br>
The new invention have moved away from the so-called "vortex chamber". By vortex<br>
chamber one means a relatively large elongation of the yarn channel before and after the<br>
region of the air blow-in point. The objective was to give the yarn or individual filaments<br>
the possibility of swinging to and fro within the vortex chamber. The new invention, on<br>
the other hand, looks for an improvement on the air side. An air twist chamber or micro-<br>
twist chamber for the air is suggested. It is true that the stability of the knots could be<br>
increased with the vortex chamber. However, this was at the expense of the number of<br>
knots. Lesser number of knots per meter of yarn is generated. The individual knots are<br>
however longer. Astonishingly, in laboratory experiments with the new solution as per<br>
the invention, one could achieve a stability of the knots that was not achieved so far, with<br>
regular knots, almost without any loss with respect to the number of knots. The micro-<br>
twist of the air alone is possible, as the local airflow lies in the sonic and supersonic range<br>
and the phenomenon of supersonic flow is used, in that two strong, locally restricted<br>
steady air twist flows are forced.<br>
The inventor has further identified, that the methods used so far were based on an<br>
inadequate model of formation of the knots. The opposite twists in each flow-off<br>
direction are stable as long as there is no yarn in the yarn channel. The presence of yarn<br>
causes a to and fro swinging of the twists. Investigations by the applicant have shown,<br>
that the to and fro swinging of both the opposite twists within a short time is the key to<br>
the formation of knots. A combination of both big twists, as well as an indeterminable<br>
number of tiny twists causes to and fro pull and knotting of the individual filaments. The<br>
fact thereby is the complete instability of the counter-running twists, when yarn is<br>
transported through the yarn channel. As against that, one restricted oneself to double<br>
twist formation according to the model of the state-of-the-art technology. The<br>
contradiction involved was overlooked. It has now been determined by the inventor that<br>
the situation for treatment of fine yarn can be significantly improved, if instead of a<br>
continuous, uniform yarn feed channel or a yarn twist chamber, an air twist chamber is<br>
attached in the inlet region of the blast air in the yarn treatment channel, so that the air<br>
flow at the concerned point gets transferred into two strong, undisturbed twist flows. The<br>
air twist chamber represent a miniature blast air channel elongation and forms a transition<br>
between a completely stable twist flow in the region of air blow-in and the subsequent<br>
similarly completely unstable twist zone up to the exit out of the yarn channel. This<br>
gives a sharper twist force in yarn run direction, as well as against the yarn run direction.<br>
The airflows take place at sonic and supersonic velocities, so that the corresponding<br>
phenomenon can additionally be utilized.<br>
The invention permits a large number of advantageous extensions. The basis model is,<br>
that a short region of a twist flow is generated in the air twist chamber, which is<br>
subsequently followed in the yarn run direction as well as against the yarn run direction<br>
by an alternating twist zone. The following table gives an overview about the different<br>
yarn types with the corresponding filament fineness:<br>

A series of extensive experiments with the solution as per the invention have shown, that<br>
for the blast air, compressed air of more than 0.5 bar is used, however lesser than 3 bar,<br>
and a knotted yarn with high stability of the yarn can be produced. Yarns lesser than 2 to<br>
5 dpf, mainly lesser than 1 dpf, were treated. The yarn channel cross-section is<br>
preferably designed in semicircular or U-shape, whereby the yarn channel width (B) is<br>
greater than the yarn channel depth (T). The air twist chamber represents a cup-like air<br>
channel extension in the yarn channel. The air twist chamber is designed at least approx.<br>
symmetrical and projects on both sides lesser than 0.5 mm beyond the sidewalls of the<br>
yarn channel. A very important point of the new solution is. that the air twist chamber is<br>
designed in miniaturized form in such a way, that the yarn bundle cannot completely<br>
penetrate into the side extension of the air twist chamber. The air twist chamber projects<br>
only by a fraction of a millimetre beyond the air channel wall. Hence, for a 1.6 mm wide<br>
yarn channel the maximum width of the yarn chamber is suggested as 2.2 mm. It was<br>
initially totally surprising for all concerned, that with the help of such a tiny measure,<br>
correspondingly great effects could be achieved. The explanation lies in the specific<br>
design of the supersonic airflow.<br>
The new invention could be investigated with a series of experiments with DTY-yarns<br>
(draw twist yarns). The results were good for soft, medium and hard yarns. The most<br>
astonishing results were for soft yarns, particularly microfilament yarns. Initial<br>
experiments with flat yarns were positive, even though the results were significantly low<br>
with respect to DTY-yarns. At least on the basis of theoretical ideas, the new invention<br>
can also be applied for BCF-yarns, whereby in the case of BCF-yarns, on account of the<br>
much greater yarn channel widths of up to 8 mm, the air twist chamber should project by<br>
max. 22% and min. 5% of the yarn channel width.<br>
The new invention also allows a large number of design extensions of the yarn-twisting<br>
nozzle. Thus it is suggested that the yarn treatment cross-section be designed as<br>
semicircular or in U-shape and with a flat baffle cover.<br>
All experiments have clearly shown that the actual critical dimensions of the air twist<br>
chamber are the sideways projection and the longitudinal measurements. The air twist<br>
chamber is designed as a miniaturized cup with respect to the yarn treatment channel<br>
cross-section, similar in shape sideways, whereby the air twist chamber projects on both<br>
sides of the yarn treatment channel by lesser than 0.5 mm. A projection dimension of<br>
lesser than 0.5 mm could be confirmed with yarns up to 500 deniers, i.e. with yarn<br>
channel widths up to 3 mm.<br>

For greater yarn channel widths above 3 mm, a projection dimension of lesser than 22%<br>
and greater than 5% of the yarn channel width is prescribed. The projection dimension<br>
should ideally lie between 10% and 20% of the yarn channel width. The air twist<br>
chamber further has an approx. circular-symmetrical contour and forms an extension of<br>
the centre axis of the blast air feed channel. For intensifying the sideways air twist<br>
formation, the width of the yarn channel cross-section should ideally be greater than the<br>
yarn channel depth in the direction of the blast air feed. The treatment channel could<br>
thereby be designed as wide channel with a width of preferably 0.6 to 3 mm, preferably<br>
with a ratio of yarn channel width (B) to yarn channel depth (T) of 1.2 to 2.5. According<br>
to experiments, the length of the air twist chamber should ideally be lesser than 1.3 times<br>
the yarn channel width. The length of the air twist chamber should preferably be approx.<br>
0.7 to 1.6 times with respect to the yarn channel width, most specifically 0.8 to 1.2 times.<br>
which is significantly below L/B-ratio of approx. 1.75 as in the state-of-the-art<br>
technology.<br>
According to yet another design extension idea, the blast air feed channel is designed in<br>
round or oval shape or oval with triangular character or Y-shaped, whereby the side<br>
measurement of the blast air feed channel is maximum equal to or lesser than the<br>
corresponding yarn channel width. The yarn channel width (B) is designed greater than<br>
the air feed channel width d, preferably in a ratio of B/d of 1.1 to 3.<br>
According to yet another advantageous solution, it is suggested that the yarn channel be<br>
formed with the help of a flat shift-able buffer plate and a nozzle plate with the blast air<br>
feed. In this case, the yarn channel is preferably designed with a nozzle plate as well as a<br>
baffle plate that can be slid to it (as a so-called SlideJet), with an open position of the<br>
yarn channel for threading the yarn and a closed position of the yarn channel for<br>
producing knotted yarn. The nozzle plate is designed as a plate-like ceramic disc in such<br>
a way, that the ceramic disc along with a sliding part can be mounted in or dismantled<br>
from the twist nozzle, and/or that the ceramic disc can be mounted in or dismantled from<br>
the sliding part as change plate.<br>

the-art technology (figs. 15a and 15b), as well as a new solution (fig. 15c);<br>
Figs. 16a and 16b show important quality differences from comparative laboratory<br>
investigations with solutions as per the state-of-the-art technology, as well<br>
as with the new invention;<br>
Fig. 17 gives the experiment results comparing cases with and without air twist<br>
chamber with flat yarn "fully drawn" for different air pressures of the feed<br>
air.<br>
Figures la to 1f show the classical model for producing a knotted yarn 2" with the help of<br>
a twisting nozzle 1. Here, knots K are formed from an untwisted smooth yarn 2 in a yarn<br>
treatment channel 3 under the effect of blast air BL with individual filaments; these knots<br>
are formed according to the classical understanding from a double twist formation of the<br>
blast air, in yarn run direction 7 as well as against the yarn run direction within the yarn<br>
treatment channel 3. The blast air BL enters through a blast air channel 4 in the direction<br>
of the arrow 5 and generates the typical double twists 6, as one can see in figures 1 b and<br>
1d. The knotted yarn 2' leaves the twisting nozzle 1 as indicated by the arrow 8.<br>
According to figures la and 1b the yarn treatment channel 3 has a round cross-section.<br>
The same holds good for the blast air channel 4. The solution as shown in figures 1c and<br>
1d similarly conforms to the known state-of-the-art technology and represents an<br>
improved solution, to the extent that the yam channel 3 is formed by a semicircular shape<br>
in a nozzle plate 9 and a flat cover plate 10. By means of this specific shaping, one<br>
obtains significantly more pronounced double twists 6 as expressed in fig. Id.<br>
More extensive investigations in recent times have shown that the knowledge of<br>
formation of knots was rather incomplete. In fact, the formation of knots does not simply<br>
occur out of both these stable double twists 6. A basic pre-requisite for the formation of<br>
knots is the following fact:<br>
a) It is true that a double twist is generated with the blast air jet BL in the yarn<br>
treatment channel (figs. I band Id).<br>
b) The double twist is however completely disturbed as shown in figs. 1 c and If, if a<br>
filament yarn 2 enters into the yarn treatment channel 3. On entry of the yarn, the<br>
stable double twist is destroyed within milliseconds. A one-sided twist 6* gets<br>
formed in one half of the yarn treatment channel, whereas the twist 6** collapses.<br>
As a result, all filaments in the yarn treatment channel 3 swing to the right side.<br>
The gathering of all filaments on the right side however immediately destroys the<br>
double twist, so that a corresponding large twist 6*** sets in on the left side<br>
(fig. 1b) almost without any time lag. This swinging movement in the presence of<br>
blast air and the filament yarn is a totally unsteady, permanent condition and<br>
ultimately the reason for formation of knots.<br>
Figures 2a to 2d show a solution as per the invention. Contrary to figures 1c to 1f, the<br>
yarn treatment channel 3 additionally has an air twist chamber 11 that represents an<br>
immediate extension of the blast air feed channel 4 into the yarn treatment channel 3.<br>
The yarn treatment channel 3 is extended in a cup at the point of the blast air feed channel<br>
4, as one can see from the corresponding cup 12 in fig. 2d. Thus there is an additional<br>
twist flow in a section II, II of fig. 4, corresponding to both arrows 13, 13' in fig. 2a. The<br>
cup-shaped extension allows a locally steady twist flow without any negative influence of<br>
the unsteady twist movement in the subsequent part of the yarn treatment channel 3. The<br>
locally steady twist-flow immediately moves over into the unsteady twist flow as shown<br>
in both figures 2c and 2d. Fig. 2b shows a nozzle plate 9 designed as per the invention.<br>
Here, for the same features, the same reference signs have been used in figures 1 and 2.<br>
One can clearly identify the miniature design of the air twist chamber that is designed<br>
only sufficiently large, so that the filament bundle cannot move in it.<br>
Figures 3a to 3c show three different cross-sectional shapes for the blast air feed channel;<br>
fig. 3a with circular shape 4', fig. 3b with a semi-oval shape 4", as well as fig. 3c with an<br>
oval shape 4"'.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b respectively show the result of a CFD-flow calculation. In fig. 4a one<br>
can clearly identify the blast air feed BL from bottom to top. The upper level is denoted<br>
by E and depicts the target surface of the blast airflow BL on the baffle plate 10. The air<br>
twist chamber 11 is obtained from both the small cup-like recesses 12. One can clearly<br>
identify in fig. 4a both the twist flows 14, which in the range of lesser than 1 to 2 mm in<br>
longitudinal direction yield very stable flow patterns. In fig. 4a one can identify, on the<br>
basis of the same calculation model (without the presence of yarns), the steady twist flow<br>
14 in the centre and both the double twists 6 at the top of the picture. Fig. 4c is a drawing<br>
that schematically depicts both the flow patterns.<br>
Figures 5a to 5e show the solution of Figures 2 to 4 as per the invention, attached in a<br>
concrete nozzle plate 9 for a SlightJet-nozzle.<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show an entire twisting nozzle I that is designed as SlightJet. Fig. 6b<br>
shows the open position or threading position and fig. 6a shows the closed operating<br>
position. A nozzle plate 9 is mounted in the twisting nozzle 1, whereby a sliding part 23<br>
can slide to and fro on the lower shank of a yoke 25. A sliding lever 26 that converts the<br>
rotary movement into linear movement through corresponding mechanics effects the<br>
sliding movement. The rotary movement of the sliding lever 26 is thereby converted into<br>
pure sliding movement as indicated by the arrow 27. Very important for the twist is a<br>
baffle plate 10 that gets continuously pressed on to the upper plane surface of the nozzle<br>
plate 9 under spring pressure. The flat, plane surface with high surface quality allows the<br>
movement with simultaneous sealing function, for which a baffle plate 10 made of<br>
ceramic and a ceramic nozzle plate 9 are particularly suitable. The yarn channel 3 and an<br>
air feed channel are attached in the nozzle plate 9. For operating position, the air feed<br>
channel can be connected to a compressed air source 22. In the operating position, the<br>
yarn channel 3 is determined by the part visible in fig. 6a and the lower plane surface of<br>
the baffle plate 10. Fig. 6c shows a nozzle plate 9. Fig. 6d shows an entire sliding part<br>
23 with inserted nozzle plate 9. Fig. 6d is also supposed to depict that the fastening of the<br>
nozzle plate 9 in the sliding part 23 leaves several solution possibilities open. The nozzle<br>
plate 9 can be cast-in directly into the sliding part 23 by an injection moulding process, so<br>
that the ceramic disc and the sliding part 23 form an inseparable component. It is also<br>
possible to affix/paste the ceramic disc into the sliding part.<br>
Fig. 7a shows the closed operating positions. The sliding lever 26 is situated in the<br>
countersunk position of the yarn channel 3 for through-run of the yarn for air treatment,<br>
for which compressed air can be fed through a connection or a compressed air<br>
hole/channel. By turning the sliding lever 26 upwards, the sliding part 23 gets pushed<br>
forward (fig. 7c) and at the same time the air feed is shut off, which is effected by shifting<br>
both the compressed air feed holes by the dimension G. By pressing a loose lever as<br>
shown by arrow K, the compressed spring force over the baffle plate 10 is lifted and the<br>
catch of a sliding axis is released into a catch groove, so that the sliding part 23 can be<br>
freely pushed forward (fig. 7b). The sliding part 23 can now be removed from the device<br>
(fig. 7f) and the ceramic disc can be removed in the direction of the sliding part 23.<br>
Reinstallation takes place in opposite directions to what is shown in figures 7a to 7f.<br>
Figures 8a to 8c depict an absolutely favourable connection. Fig. 8a shows the first step<br>
for installing the nozzle plate 9. The nozzle plate 9 is placed on the sliding part 23<br>
transverse to the sliding direction, as shown by the arrow 41. A negative part and a<br>
positive part 42, 43 help in placing the nozzle plate 9 manually in a specialized manner,<br>
as shown in perspective depiction in fig. 8b. In fig. 8d the nozzle plate 9 is completely<br>
settled in sliding part 23, whereby already the rotation movement of the nozzle plate 9<br>
can be identified by the arrow. The nozzle plate 9 has a cam on both sides and the sliding<br>
part 23 has a round sliding guide conforming to it. The nozzle plate 9 has circular<br>
segments on both sides with respect to a fulcrum; the circular segments fit into a<br>
corresponding circular guide of the sliding part 23 with little tolerance. After completion<br>
of the rotation movement as shown in fig. 8d, there is a stop point that catches from<br>
below by slight spring pressure and fixes the nozzle plate 9 in the operating position.<br>
Fig. 9a shows untwisted yarn 2. This can however be smooth as well as FZ-texturized.<br>
The straight lines indicate the individual filaments 45. Fig. 9b shows a softly twisted<br>
yarn. The typical feature thereby are the rather shorts knots K, whereby the knots are<br>
symbolized by thin straight lines. Fig. 9b shows hard, relatively long knots K between<br>
the twisted open positions. The hard knots are denoted by thicker lines. Fig. 9d shows a<br>
typical knotted yarn as per the state-of-the-art technology with very irregular knots.<br>
Figures 10a to 10c show a few examples with irregular knot formation.<br>
Fig. 11 is a comparison for hard and soft knots that can be produced with the help of the<br>
new invention. Fig. 11 shows a typical allied area of application of compressed air of 1.5<br>
to 3 bar or 0.5 to 1.5 bar. Depending on the market and mainly the nature of further<br>
processing, hard knots or soft knots are required.<br>
Figures 12a and 12d show the possibility of application of a Y-shaped blast air channel<br>
cross-section with corresponding main air channel H and side air channel N. Fig. 12c<br>
shows a further example for the design of an air twist chamber 11' as per the invention.<br>
Figures 13a to 13c show a solution as per the state-of-the-art technology, as produced by<br>
the applicant for already over 20 years. Here one finds a typically long yarn-twisting<br>
chamber with relatively large width and length. This solution was based on the model,<br>
that the yarn could swing out in the yarn-twisting chamber to a very large extent.<br>
Fig. 14a shows a solution as per the invention and as comparison (figs. 14b, 14c) two<br>
solutions as per the state-of-the-art technology. All investigations so far have revealed<br>
that there is a critical dimension for the projection of the air twist chamber. This is<br>
approx. 0.5 mm. In all chamber designs, where the chamber projects by more than<br>
0.5 mm sideways, one can determine a clear reduction in quality. Experiments so far<br>
have shown that the sideways projection of the chamber over the yarn treatment channel<br>
3 should be assessed as critical. It was determined that it is advantageous if the length of<br>
the chamber in the yarn channel in the longitudinal direction is lesser than 1.3 times the<br>
yarn channel width (B).<br>
Figures 15a. 15b and 15c show a comparison of the knots formation: fig. 15a according<br>
to a solution as shown in figures 13a to 13c; fig. 15b according to a solution without<br>
twisting chamber as shown in figures i and 1a; and fig. 15c a solution as per the<br>
invention. In all three solutions, yarns of 80 f 72, 80 f 108, 72 f 72 and 80 f 34 are used.<br>
Depending on the method of operation or the pressure of the blast air, one obtains soft or<br>
hard knots.<br>
Both the figures 16a and 16b show results with comparative experiments - fig. J 6a with<br>
coarse yarn and fig. 16b with fine yarn. The left-side figure always shows the number of<br>
knots per meter, the central figure shows the dispersion of the knots and the right-side<br>
figure shows the stability or the knots-loss under tensile stress. Even nozzles with no<br>
chamber or with round chambers were used (with cup-widths K. of 2.2; 2.4; 2.6; 2.8 mm).<br>
The chamber was designed in cup shape. One can clearly see that the cup-width K of 2.2<br>
mm as per the invention with a real air twist chamber as per the invention, produces the<br>
best result. In all experiments the yarn channel width was 1.6 mm, the yarn channel<br>
depth 1.0 mm and the air blow-in hole 1.1 mm. The advantages as per the invention are<br>
also visible, if additionally elasthane yarns are also introduced into the nozzle and<br>
combined with the filament yarns already mentioned before.<br>

region into the yam treatment channel gets converted in a short air twist chamber in yarn<br>
channel longitudinal direction into two strong, steady twist flows undisturbed by filament<br>
bundles. In spite of the tiny nature of the air twist chamber, which projects max. 0.5 mm<br>
or 5% to 22% of the yarn channel width (B) beyond the yarn channel longitudinal wall,<br>
the regularity of the knots can be highly improved. It is further possible, depending on<br>
the pressure of the blast air, to generate hard or soft knots that get released again.<br></td>
