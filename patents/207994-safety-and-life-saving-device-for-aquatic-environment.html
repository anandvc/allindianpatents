SAEETTP   AND   LIFE-SAVING   DEVICE   FOR   AQUATIC   ENVIRONMENT The object of the present invention is to create rescue and safety devices which not only enable first<br>
aid to be given directly on the device but also, in open water, to enable a victim situated under the<br>
device to pass tlirough the device, to come up and remain on top and, in a swimming pool, to be able to<br>
easily clean the bottom while walking on the device. This applies to Olympic pools, private swimming<br>
pools, lakes or open water, these devices supporting the weight of numerous persons moving about on<br>
the device.<br>
The teclinical background discloses many submersible or non submersible covers or bottoms variable in steps, whose main function is not the rescue of persons in trouble. These devices are not reliable, notably in the case of submersible covers, as they are not sufficiently strong to support the weight of many persons and are moreover slow in their movement.<br>
The document US 4,129,905 of Dec. 19, 1978 has proposed to build a rescue device which is a ne supported by an inflatable bladder of small size.<br>
Tliis device has tlie following drawbacks:	<br>
-	The arms and its periphery' supporting the net has a diameter of 7.6cm, the central bladder a<br>
diameter of 60 cm, the lengtli of the pool is 6 m, the design features are not met for supporting the<br>
weight of the net and of a person. The bladder diameter of 60 cm is smaller than a conventional buoy.<br>
The essential deficiency is that there is nothing to fix the device in a raised Dosition.<br>
Only two guide bars are provided at tlie deepest part of the pool with the sole purpose of guiding the flotation. According to tlie description by tlie inventor, guide bars are not necessary in the shallow part of the pool, which constitutes a real danger. Given the vv'eakness of the device, if someone were recovered and brought up to tlie surface in the deepest part of the pool, the device would be drawn ^togetlier on itself.<br>
As is moreover acknowledged by the author, in order to ensure safety', the device must be covered w-ith a tarpaulin when the pool is not being used, line 67 to 70, columns 2 and 3.<br>
Patent application DE 32 10590 AI, 23.03 82 mentions a device for use in open water which has tlie following drav.'backs:<br>
-	The cells of the device are provided at certain places witli empty spaces of 40 to 70 cm width<br>
which have been created to enable a person to pass through. This arrangement is dangerous in a rough<br>
sea, because a weakened person or child tossed about by tlie sea would be liable to pass under the<br>
device and be lost. <br><br>
wo 01/106076	TRANSLATION	PCT/CH99/00619<br>
2<br>
Tlic structure of the air chambers of the floats has a diameter of 5 to 10 cm, commercially available individual life-buoys for bathing generally having a larger diameter and being intended for a calm sea.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a rescue and safety  device which is able to meet tliese deficiencies and drawbacks.<br>
The advantages of the present invention reside in the fact that the openings in the netting are intended to enable cleaning the bottom of a swimming pool, it being easy in this case to reach tlie centre of the swimming pool by walking on the device to insert the arm of the vacuum cleaner and tliat, in the case of open water, the openings in the netting are intended to enable someone caught underneath the device to return to the surface by unlocking and widening the openings in the netting. The locking system prevents someone from sliding  with ones weight into the slit. These openings with their locking system should be made visible by means of bright or fluorescent colours to indicate their presence.<br>
Anotlier advantage is that the device in swimming pools, lakes as well as a beach portion for example, comprises a system of guide rails with stops, which blocks the system in the high position, these stops balance the tension when several persons move about on the device. These stops also function to prevent the device from folding up under load, which prevents the device from forming a hollow between tlie edge of the swimming  pool and tlie grille and prevents a child fi^om slipping through between the device and the edge of tlie swimming pool.<br>
The sheet, tarpaulin or the materials used to manufacture the grille may be woven or nonwoven syntlietic or elastomer materials, but should be as light as possible and nevertheless be heavy enough for the deflated grille to sink down through its own weight, and to provide technical safeguards with regard to wear, tear, &amp;iction, pressure.<br>
To tliis end, a person skilled in the art should know the maximum load which the device will have to support, taking into account the impact of weights projected onto the device, jumping, running, tension, pressure, friction to which the device is subjected, in order to be able to determine the diameter of the crosspieces of the grille, on wliieh one should be able to walk easily, run, jump and play, and that with respect to the size of tlie openings, the dimension, number and strength of the slide rails and the stops, tlie criteria of strength of the netting, adapted in each case to tlie size of the water surface, Olympic pool or private swimming pool, whit  respect to the maximum load.<br>
.Ajiother safety aspect has been allowed for due to tlie fact that the deflated grille placed at or near the bottom is connected to a vacuum pump in operating condition, connected to an alarm, whose purpose is to draw attention immediatey' to an infiltration of water into tlie device. This vacuum pump may also be used to help in deflating the grille.<br>

In a non-restrictive example of an embodiment intended for swimming pools or water surfaces such as portions of beaches, tlic present device is composed mainly of an inflatable grille (1), Fig. 1, whose meshes (39) arc fitted with netting (5) which is provided with openings (6) adapted to be widened or locked; said grille (1) is not inflated, rests upon the bottom (40) and is secured to the slide rails (3) by means of a slide (14) and its fastener (30) to the grille, see tliis detail in Fig. 7a and 7b, said slide rails (3) are provided with a non-return system (4), Fig. 1, see detail Fig. 6a, b, c and 7a and 7b; the grille with tliis design is connected by means of a pipe (36) and couplings at both ends (32), Fig. 1, to a compressed air cylmder (34) or to a gas generator, on which is fixed by means of the coupling (32) a punch button (35) or handle, push-button, and a release valve (41), Fig. 1. The device thus designed rises to the surface by means of air or gas driven therein and is blocked in the high position the non-return system of the slide rails, see Fig. 2. It is adaptable to swimming pools, olympic pools, water surfaces, beaches and may-serve as a playground.<br>
For large swimming pools or Olympic pools, it is possible to constitute the device in sections interconnected by means of netting, which prevents someone fi"om passing imder the device when one section is inflated and an adjacent section is not, while batliers move about on the de\'ice. It is recommended in tliat case to arrange a punch-button or handle and cylinder on each of the opposite sides ot the section or at each end ot the swimmmg pool, so as not to have to run around tlie swimming pool to be able to operate the device.<br>
It is also possible to conceive several pipes with couplings to the grille grouped in multiple branches with couplings to the cylinder, this allowing air/gas to arrive at several points in the grille; tlie same applies to the punch-buttons, handles, push buttons connected by means of pipes, branches, couplings and valve(s).<br>
It is also possible to facilitate the distribution of inflation by inserting into tlie grille structure a pipe pierced along its entire lengtli, tliis possibility being applicable to any tspe of embodiment of tlie grille.<br>
The grille folded up is dropped from a boat or aircraft, without the slide rails, wth its openings adapted to be widened or locked, pairs of toe clips, toe clips with extensions, and with an automatic uiflating s^'stem. and when unfolded it covers a large surface and serves for lifesaving in open water.<br>
For water surfaces such as portions of beaches, the slide rails will be securely fastened at the bottom and thus define the safety_or playmg zone<br>
One thus has here neitlier a submersibled  over. nor a bottom which is raised, but rather a safety  and rescue grille which may serve as a playground.<br>

There are numerous locking systems for the openings in the netting, and a few non-restrictive examples are given here:<br>
-	A slit closed by means of a Velcro fastener with broad bands.<br>
-	Two spring rods (26) protected by a sheathing wliich may be fixed by a hook (19), Fig. 14.<br>
-	The slit in the netting may be bordered with two elastic bands (18) which maintain it closed witli a hook (19), Fig. 9.<br>
-	Lips rehiforced witli a band of resistant fabric, or synthetic fabric or elastomer (29), stitched, glued or welded and fasteners (25), Fig, 14.<br>
These non-restrictive examples of openings adapted to be widened or locked are suitable for swimming pools as well as for open water, whereas the two following examples seem more suitable for the device m open water, this not being restrictive.<br>
-	The hooks (19), Fig. 9, may be simple ones or such clips as in safety belts, or release devices<br>
(28), Fig. 10, or they may be lengthened wirh a handle (22), Fig. 11, situated below and flush with the<br>
netting which, when pulled downwards, releases the hook integral therewitli, and firees the opening.<br>
Netting fixed on one side of tlie mesh of tlie grille structure, with the other side comprising a bar provided with a fastening system, such as balls (16), Fig. 8, hooks, rings, spring hooks at its ends wliich fit in a support for the ball, in a ring for the hook, in a hook for the ring, and so on. Instead of the bar for securing the netting, it may be secured solely with a hooking system, or a series of catches, but the bar may at the same time secure the netting in at least two points.<br>
Tlie netting may be radially arranged (27), tied up in the middle with an elastic band (18), both sides of tlie circle brought together and secured with a hook (19), Fig. 14.<br>
Concerning the distribution of the netting openings adapted to be widened or locked, in open water It seems desirable to provide one in each mesh of the grille, but this is not imperative and it is possible to provide a smaller number. In swimming pools, the openings adapted to be widened or locked could be scattered over tlie device, the arm of the vacuum cleaner covering a certain surface, but it may nevertheless be more convenient to provide each mesh of tiie grille with one opemng adapted to be widened or locked.<br>
As for tlie slide rails, there are countless non-retum s\'stems, such as stops, racks, ratchet gear, wedge nngs, split wedges, a catch either with or witliout a slit, resting on a tappet, or not, the grille coming up to the surface slides along tlie hollow slide rails driving a slide which arrives at the top of the slide rail, pushes the catch, the fastener of the slide is then engaged in the slot of the catch or m the case of a simple catch (13), Fig. 7a, the slide (14). while coming up along the hollow slide rails (15), will come to lie on the catch as indicated in Fig. 7b. in both cases the grille will be blocked in the high position.<br>
BCL011WODOC    16 1201<br>
wo 01/106076	TRANSLATION	PCT/CH99/00619<br>

Ajiother version of the non-return slide rail could be a bar (11), a vertical ramp with a ring (10) fastened to the grille by means of a link (30) and surrounding the bar (11), the ring (10) sliding upwards due to the thrust of the grille, and which, when arriving at the top of the bar, falls back onto a catch attached thereto and which swings on its axis (31) and returns to its place by its own weight. Tlic catch may also come to abut against a spring which returns it to its initial position.<br>
These non-return systems are simple to unlock once the grille is deflated, one only has to raise the slide by hand by pulling it and causing it to pass under the catch; for the ring, one has to push the catch on its a?ds and the ring falls back, the deflated grille can descend once more.<br>
This choice of non-retum systems is not restrictive. The size and thickness of the catches and the tappets will be defined as a function of the diameter of the shde rails, their number and the load and tension which tliey have to support.<br>
One can multiply the systems along the slide rails or guide bars so that the system will hook on anywhere on the path, whether the swimming pool is fiiil or not, one can tlius create a rack and safety is ensured under any circumstances.<br>
In open water tlie air/gas may be replaced with a driven closed-cell foam-witch is developed inside the device, this particularity being of special interest because it makes the device unsinkable. A person skilled in the art will have to find the foam which is best adapted to this feature of the invention.<br>
It should be noted that, in closed environments, tlie grille is situated at or in the victnity  of the bottom in the low position and that in open water it is situated at a certain depth determined by its weight and its impact when dropped and goes back to tlie surface when it is inflated by appropriate means.<br>
If the inflatable grille is to be laid down at the water surface, rather than dropped, its inflation could be set off on contact with the water by means of chemical valves, or else manually by means of handles, release systems, retarded releases, these examples not being restrictive.<br>
In open water, the grille is provided with pairs of adjustable or non-adjustable toe clips 20, Fig. 10, enabling someone sittmg in the netting or on a crosspiece to reach the opposite pair of toe clips, with or without folding the legs, to sUp the feet into them, to point tliem to the sky', to slip in the hands, forearms into those which are at his sides and to tiius keep himself in place on the device in case of a rough sea; if he capsizes, he is not tied to the device and can pass through the openings adapted to be widened and unlocked.<br>
Now, if preferred, when certain toe clips are lengthened with an adjustable strap and provided with clip fasteners, as in safety belts or releases (21), Fig. 10, one may catch one on the left and one on the right, clip them together and tlius fonn a safety  belt, or else may choose to use them to attach equipment to the device<br>

In the variant notably for use in open water, one may envisage that the grille, especially for a small vessel or aircraft, is deflated by means of stops of the t&gt;pe used in pneumatic mattresses or by witlidrawing a simple stop, screwed on or not, or tlie rescue team on board the aircraft or boats willl have a vacuum pump for use to help deflatmg the grille,<br>
Tlic netting in the meshes of the grille could be bonded, welded, sewnl, moulded, fastened by means of lugs (37), Fig. 3, and the same applies to the toe clips, which are padded or unpadded straps fastened at both ends to the crosspieces of the grille, this not being restrictive. The netting may be fixed at any desired height inside the mesh of the grille.<br>
It should be noted that the inflatable gnile for use in open water may be made entirely or partly fluorescent, it may be coated or covered with metallic products or carry metallic elements enabling it to be located by radar, may be provided with radio-wave transmitters, acoustic transmitters, sur\'ival kits, emergency beacons enabling it to be located For swimming pools or water surfaces, presence detectors may be installed and distributed around the water surface and vice-versa and connected to an alarm in order to indicate a fall.<br>
Once the grille is inflated it resembles a large game board on which one may jirnip in balance fi"om crosspiece to crosspiece, or nm on the crosspieces, or with several persons in tlie netting, with a slight trampoline effect, whose vibrations are dampened by tlie non-return system of the slide rails, Fig. 15, and may tlius serve as a playground.<br>
In a swimming pool, the device m high position enables cleaning the bottom, Fig. 16.<br>
The device has a certain advantage that a guard may easily come to the assistance of a person in trouble and administer first-aid directly on the device, whereby precious time is gained, and that it is possible to make the person in trouble lie down on the back and be settled more comfortably tlian on the border of a swimming pool, Fig. 2.<br>
This grille is placed at the bottom to attend to the safety of the bathers, its mooring becomes active in the high position when it is blocked in the non-return system of the slide rails, it ensures the rescue of persons in trouble by coming up to the surface; in the high position, it ensures the safety of the emdronment while, in open water, it enables many persons to take refuge on a large surface.<br>
In open water, the size of the grille may be adapted to the size of the boat or to the number of persons wliich tlie device has to support As it takes little space, one may envisage arranging more than one per boat; it should be kept protected from any infiltration of water in a cover, sheath, or waterproof case which may be easily opened,with a simple and rapid unlocking system for example. The grille may finally be formed of superimposed ribs which set a distance between the water and the persons on the device.<br>

These grilles may be folded up and stored separately on board ships, cargo boats or any other vessels as well as on board any type of aircraft. They enable persons on a jetty for example, to use a distress toboggan to descend on the device, while the device may be connected or not to the toboggan by means of a system of fasteners which may be easily released.<br>
When the swimming pool is not in use, the device may be placed in the high position and covered with a protective covering enabling the passage of water, fastened to the top of the guide rails, in order to prevent small impurities or dead leaves from soiling tlie swuraning pool water.<br>

SAEETTP   AND   LIFE-SAVING   DEVICE   FOR   AQUATIC   ENVIRONMENT The object of the present invention is to create rescue and safety devices which not only enable first<br>
aid to be given directly on the device but also, in open water, to enable a victim situated under the<br>
device to pass tlirough the device, to come up and remain on top and, in a swimming pool, to be able to<br>
easily clean the bottom while walking on the device. This applies to Olympic pools, private swimming<br>
pools, lakes or open water, these devices supporting the weight of numerous persons moving about on<br>
the device.<br>
The teclinical background discloses many submersible or non submersible covers or bottoms variable in steps, whose main function is not the rescue of persons in trouble. These devices are not reliable, notably in the case of submersible covers, as they are not sufficiently strong to support the weight of many persons and are moreover slow in their movement.<br>
The document US 4,129,905 of Dec. 19, 1978 has proposed to build a rescue device which is a ne supported by an inflatable bladder of small size.<br>
Tliis device has tlie following drawbacks:	<br>
-	The arms and its periphery' supporting the net has a diameter of 7.6cm, the central bladder a<br>
diameter of 60 cm, the lengtli of the pool is 6 m, the design features are not met for supporting the<br>
weight of the net and of a person. The bladder diameter of 60 cm is smaller than a conventional buoy.<br>
The essential deficiency is that there is nothing to fix the device in a raised Dosition.<br>
Only two guide bars are provided at tlie deepest part of the pool with the sole purpose of guiding the flotation. According to tlie description by tlie inventor, guide bars are not necessary in the shallow part of the pool, which constitutes a real danger. Given the vv'eakness of the device, if someone were recovered and brought up to tlie surface in the deepest part of the pool, the device would be drawn ^togetlier on itself.<br>
As is moreover acknowledged by the author, in order to ensure safety', the device must be covered w-ith a tarpaulin when the pool is not being used, line 67 to 70, columns 2 and 3.<br>
Patent application DE 32 10590 AI, 23.03 82 mentions a device for use in open water which has tlie following drav.'backs:<br>
-	The cells of the device are provided at certain places witli empty spaces of 40 to 70 cm width<br>
which have been created to enable a person to pass through. This arrangement is dangerous in a rough<br>
sea, because a weakened person or child tossed about by tlie sea would be liable to pass under the<br>
device and be lost. <br>

Tlic structure of the air chambers of the floats has a diameter of 5 to 10 cm, commercially available individual life-buoys for bathing generally having a larger diameter and being intended for a calm sea.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a rescue and safety  device which is able to meet tliese deficiencies and drawbacks.<br>
The advantages of the present invention reside in the fact that the openings in the netting are intended to enable cleaning the bottom of a swimming pool, it being easy in this case to reach tlie centre of the swimming pool by walking on the device to insert the arm of the vacuum cleaner and tliat, in the case of open water, the openings in the netting are intended to enable someone caught underneath the device to return to the surface by unlocking and widening the openings in the netting. The locking system prevents someone from sliding  with ones weight into the slit. These openings with their locking system should be made visible by means of bright or fluorescent colours to indicate their presence.<br>
Anotlier advantage is that the device in swimming pools, lakes as well as a beach portion for example, comprises a system of guide rails with stops, which blocks the system in the high position, these stops balance the tension when several persons move about on the device. These stops also function to prevent the device from folding up under load, which prevents the device from forming a hollow between tlie edge of the swimming  pool and tlie grille and prevents a child fi^om slipping through between the device and the edge of tlie swimming pool.<br>
The sheet, tarpaulin or the materials used to manufacture the grille may be woven or nonwoven syntlietic or elastomer materials, but should be as light as possible and nevertheless be heavy enough for the deflated grille to sink down through its own weight, and to provide technical safeguards with regard to wear, tear, &amp;iction, pressure.<br>
To tliis end, a person skilled in the art should know the maximum load which the device will have to support, taking into account the impact of weights projected onto the device, jumping, running, tension, pressure, friction to which the device is subjected, in order to be able to determine the diameter of the crosspieces of the grille, on wliieh one should be able to walk easily, run, jump and play, and that with respect to the size of tlie openings, the dimension, number and strength of the slide rails and the stops, tlie criteria of strength of the netting, adapted in each case to tlie size of the water surface, Olympic pool or private swimming pool, whit  respect to the maximum load.<br>
.Ajiother safety aspect has been allowed for due to tlie fact that the deflated grille placed at or near the bottom is connected to a vacuum pump in operating condition, connected to an alarm, whose purpose is to draw attention immediatey' to an infiltration of water into tlie device. This vacuum pump may also be used to help in deflating the grille.<br>

In a non-restrictive example of an embodiment intended for swimming pools or water surfaces such as portions of beaches, tlic present device is composed mainly of an inflatable grille (1), Fig. 1, whose meshes (39) arc fitted with netting (5) which is provided with openings (6) adapted to be widened or locked; said grille (1) is not inflated, rests upon the bottom (40) and is secured to the slide rails (3) by means of a slide (14) and its fastener (30) to the grille, see tliis detail in Fig. 7a and 7b, said slide rails (3) are provided with a non-return system (4), Fig. 1, see detail Fig. 6a, b, c and 7a and 7b; the grille with tliis design is connected by means of a pipe (36) and couplings at both ends (32), Fig. 1, to a compressed air cylmder (34) or to a gas generator, on which is fixed by means of the coupling (32) a punch button (35) or handle, push-button, and a release valve (41), Fig. 1. The device thus designed rises to the surface by means of air or gas driven therein and is blocked in the high position the non-return system of the slide rails, see Fig. 2. It is adaptable to swimming pools, olympic pools, water surfaces, beaches and may-serve as a playground.<br>
For large swimming pools or Olympic pools, it is possible to constitute the device in sections interconnected by means of netting, which prevents someone fi"om passing imder the device when one section is inflated and an adjacent section is not, while batliers move about on the de\'ice. It is recommended in tliat case to arrange a punch-button or handle and cylinder on each of the opposite sides ot the section or at each end ot the swimmmg pool, so as not to have to run around tlie swimming pool to be able to operate the device.<br>
It is also possible to conceive several pipes with couplings to the grille grouped in multiple branches with couplings to the cylinder, this allowing air/gas to arrive at several points in the grille; tlie same applies to the punch-buttons, handles, push buttons connected by means of pipes, branches, couplings and valve(s).<br>
It is also possible to facilitate the distribution of inflation by inserting into tlie grille structure a pipe pierced along its entire lengtli, tliis possibility being applicable to any tspe of embodiment of tlie grille.<br>
The grille folded up is dropped from a boat or aircraft, without the slide rails, wth its openings adapted to be widened or locked, pairs of toe clips, toe clips with extensions, and with an automatic uiflating s^'stem. and when unfolded it covers a large surface and serves for lifesaving in open water.<br>
For water surfaces such as portions of beaches, the slide rails will be securely fastened at the bottom and thus define the safety_or playmg zone<br>
One thus has here neitlier a submersibled  over. nor a bottom which is raised, but rather a safety  and rescue grille which may serve as a playground.<br>

There are numerous locking systems for the openings in the netting, and a few non-restrictive examples are given here:<br>
-	A slit closed by means of a Velcro fastener with broad bands.<br>
-	Two spring rods (26) protected by a sheathing wliich may be fixed by a hook (19), Fig. 14.<br>
-	The slit in the netting may be bordered with two elastic bands (18) which maintain it closed witli a hook (19), Fig. 9.<br>
-	Lips rehiforced witli a band of resistant fabric, or synthetic fabric or elastomer (29), stitched, glued or welded and fasteners (25), Fig, 14.<br>
These non-restrictive examples of openings adapted to be widened or locked are suitable for swimming pools as well as for open water, whereas the two following examples seem more suitable for the device m open water, this not being restrictive.<br>
-	The hooks (19), Fig. 9, may be simple ones or such clips as in safety belts, or release devices<br>
(28), Fig. 10, or they may be lengthened wirh a handle (22), Fig. 11, situated below and flush with the<br>
netting which, when pulled downwards, releases the hook integral therewitli, and firees the opening.<br>
Netting fixed on one side of tlie mesh of tlie grille structure, with the other side comprising a bar provided with a fastening system, such as balls (16), Fig. 8, hooks, rings, spring hooks at its ends wliich fit in a support for the ball, in a ring for the hook, in a hook for the ring, and so on. Instead of the bar for securing the netting, it may be secured solely with a hooking system, or a series of catches, but the bar may at the same time secure the netting in at least two points.<br>
Tlie netting may be radially arranged (27), tied up in the middle with an elastic band (18), both sides of tlie circle brought together and secured with a hook (19), Fig. 14.<br>
Concerning the distribution of the netting openings adapted to be widened or locked, in open water It seems desirable to provide one in each mesh of the grille, but this is not imperative and it is possible to provide a smaller number. In swimming pools, the openings adapted to be widened or locked could be scattered over tlie device, the arm of the vacuum cleaner covering a certain surface, but it may nevertheless be more convenient to provide each mesh of tiie grille with one opemng adapted to be widened or locked.<br>
As for tlie slide rails, there are countless non-retum s\'stems, such as stops, racks, ratchet gear, wedge nngs, split wedges, a catch either with or witliout a slit, resting on a tappet, or not, the grille coming up to the surface slides along tlie hollow slide rails driving a slide which arrives at the top of the slide rail, pushes the catch, the fastener of the slide is then engaged in the slot of the catch or m the case of a simple catch (13), Fig. 7a, the slide (14). while coming up along the hollow slide rails (15), will come to lie on the catch as indicated in Fig. 7b. in both cases the grille will be blocked in the high position.<br>

wo 01/106076	TRANSLATION	PCT/CH99/00619<br>

Ajiother version of the non-return slide rail could be a bar (11), a vertical ramp with a ring (10) fastened to the grille by means of a link (30) and surrounding the bar (11), the ring (10) sliding upwards due to the thrust of the grille, and which, when arriving at the top of the bar, falls back onto a catch attached thereto and which swings on its axis (31) and returns to its place by its own weight. Tlic catch may also come to abut against a spring which returns it to its initial position.<br>
These non-return systems are simple to unlock once the grille is deflated, one only has to raise the slide by hand by pulling it and causing it to pass under the catch; for the ring, one has to push the catch on its a?ds and the ring falls back, the deflated grille can descend once more.<br>
This choice of non-retum systems is not restrictive. The size and thickness of the catches and the tappets will be defined as a function of the diameter of the shde rails, their number and the load and tension which tliey have to support.<br>
One can multiply the systems along the slide rails or guide bars so that the system will hook on anywhere on the path, whether the swimming pool is fiiil or not, one can tlius create a rack and safety is ensured under any circumstances.<br>
In open water tlie air/gas may be replaced with a driven closed-cell foam-witch is developed inside the device, this particularity being of special interest because it makes the device unsinkable. A person skilled in the art will have to find the foam which is best adapted to this feature of the invention.<br>
It should be noted that, in closed environments, tlie grille is situated at or in the victnity  of the bottom in the low position and that in open water it is situated at a certain depth determined by its weight and its impact when dropped and goes back to tlie surface when it is inflated by appropriate means.<br>
If the inflatable grille is to be laid down at the water surface, rather than dropped, its inflation could be set off on contact with the water by means of chemical valves, or else manually by means of handles, release systems, retarded releases, these examples not being restrictive.<br>
In open water, the grille is provided with pairs of adjustable or non-adjustable toe clips 20, Fig. 10, enabling someone sittmg in the netting or on a crosspiece to reach the opposite pair of toe clips, with or without folding the legs, to sUp the feet into them, to point tliem to the sky', to slip in the hands, forearms into those which are at his sides and to tiius keep himself in place on the device in case of a rough sea; if he capsizes, he is not tied to the device and can pass through the openings adapted to be widened and unlocked.<br>
Now, if preferred, when certain toe clips are lengthened with an adjustable strap and provided with clip fasteners, as in safety belts or releases (21), Fig. 10, one may catch one on the left and one on the right, clip them together and tlius fonn a safety  belt, or else may choose to use them to attach equipment to the device<br>

In the variant notably for use in open water, one may envisage that the grille, especially for a small vessel or aircraft, is deflated by means of stops of the t&gt;pe used in pneumatic mattresses or by witlidrawing a simple stop, screwed on or not, or tlie rescue team on board the aircraft or boats willl have a vacuum pump for use to help deflatmg the grille,<br>
Tlic netting in the meshes of the grille could be bonded, welded, sewnl, moulded, fastened by means of lugs (37), Fig. 3, and the same applies to the toe clips, which are padded or unpadded straps fastened at both ends to the crosspieces of the grille, this not being restrictive. The netting may be fixed at any desired height inside the mesh of the grille.<br>
It should be noted that the inflatable gnile for use in open water may be made entirely or partly fluorescent, it may be coated or covered with metallic products or carry metallic elements enabling it to be located by radar, may be provided with radio-wave transmitters, acoustic transmitters, sur\'ival kits, emergency beacons enabling it to be located For swimming pools or water surfaces, presence detectors may be installed and distributed around the water surface and vice-versa and connected to an alarm in order to indicate a fall.<br>
Once the grille is inflated it resembles a large game board on which one may jirnip in balance fi"om crosspiece to crosspiece, or nm on the crosspieces, or with several persons in tlie netting, with a slight trampoline effect, whose vibrations are dampened by tlie non-return system of the slide rails, Fig. 15, and may tlius serve as a playground.<br>
In a swimming pool, the device m high position enables cleaning the bottom, Fig. 16.<br>
The device has a certain advantage that a guard may easily come to the assistance of a person in trouble and administer first-aid directly on the device, whereby precious time is gained, and that it is possible to make the person in trouble lie down on the back and be settled more comfortably tlian on the border of a swimming pool, Fig. 2.<br>
This grille is placed at the bottom to attend to the safety of the bathers, its mooring becomes active in the high position when it is blocked in the non-return system of the slide rails, it ensures the rescue of persons in trouble by coming up to the surface; in the high position, it ensures the safety of the emdronment while, in open water, it enables many persons to take refuge on a large surface.<br>
In open water, the size of the grille may be adapted to the size of the boat or to the number of persons wliich tlie device has to support As it takes little space, one may envisage arranging more than one per boat; it should be kept protected from any infiltration of water in a cover, sheath, or waterproof case which may be easily opened,with a simple and rapid unlocking system for example. The grille may finally be formed of superimposed ribs which set a distance between the water and the persons on the device.<br>

These grilles may be folded up and stored separately on board ships, cargo boats or any other vessels as well as on board any type of aircraft. They enable persons on a jetty for example, to use a distress toboggan to descend on the device, while the device may be connected or not to the toboggan by means of a system of fasteners which may be easily released.<br>
When the swimming pool is not in use, the device may be placed in the high position and covered with a protective covering enabling the passage of water, fastened to the top of the guide rails, in order to prevent small impurities or dead leaves from soiling tlie swuraning pool water.<br>
