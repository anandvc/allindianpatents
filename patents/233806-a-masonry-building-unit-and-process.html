				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to masonry construction. More specifically, the subject invention relates to novel and unique masonry building unit or modular building unit such as a brick having interlocking or interfitting projections and depressions which are self aligned and self adjustable. Bonding of the said masonry units is achieved by pouring mortar from the top or from the side as per the requirements.<br>
The subject invention also relates to an apparatus for manufacturing the said masonry units and a process for construction thereof.<br>
The object of the present invention is to make the masonry construction easier by distribution of the mortar by pouring it in void space between the masonry building unit so that the quality of construction is better and uniform, man power requirement and time of construction is reduced resuting in increased strength of masonry and reducing the cost thereof.<br>
The conventional masonry construction is the assembly of building block units, such as bricks, stone, concrete by laying such units adjacent to each other in a composite wall, column or other structures. These building units are joined by some or the other type of mortar which is wet mixture of one building unit or block adjacent thereto. The mortar sets up, cementing the building units together as it hardens, such masonry construction has distinctive architectural characteristics which have been desired since ages, and still being the type of construction preferred by many.<br>
One of the problem associated with masonry constructions is non uniformity of building units and mortar is necessarily used not only to bond the units but to smooth out the irregularities of building units or bricks. The shear strength of masonry is a function of bond strength of mortar to the associated brick or other building block and fractional  resistance at the building block - mortar interface.<br><br>
Mortar are typically mixed at the job site and are used beyond its useful mix life. The thickness of mortar in vertical and horizontal points varies considerably which results in large variation in strength of masonry. Also the building blocks and walls are not aligned under existing method of construction which require uneven large thickness of plasters for traditional masonry construction and skilled man power.<br>
A new type of selfadjusting masonry block was developed in West Germany [Plauk et al. (1991)] for increasing the efficiency of masonry construction.   The masonry units with a calcium silicate composition have a small groove running in the middle of the top and bottom face of the block parallel to the bed joint. A thin layer mortar is applied using a specially constructed trowel which keeps the groove free of mortar.    Small plastic discs are inserted into the groove for adjusting the blocks in the next course.   The resulting self adjustment of the blocks, a thin layer of mortar bed with a constant thickness and the precise dimensions of masonry units allow fast progress of work ensuring well-aligned walls with plane surfaces.<br>
Another innovative masonry unit was developed by a construction company from New York in United States for building insulated walls for energy conservation. The concrete masonry block comprises of two masonry shells with inner faces that interlock with a stirroform layer inserted between them for thermal insulation [Reinhorn et al. (1994)].   The block is designed so that the stirrofoam insert protrudes a standard height above the bed face of the block.   The resulting configuration of the block facilitates self-spacing in the vertical direction between the blocks in adjacent courses.    Thus, the design allows the mass to lay a number of courses of blocks without applying mortar on the bed joints which can be subsequently injected into the gaps formed between adjacent courses due to self-spacing action of the blocks.<br>
Dry Stacked Masonry, interlocking mortarless masonry and surface bonded masonry (6,7,8,9.) have been developed and used in various countries. Most of them are trade marked or proprietary products. A consolidated review of such masonry units are shown in Table below;<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br><br>
The geometry of these masonry units are shown in Fig. 1. Such Masonry blocks can be classified as per the interlocking mechanism as Tongue and groove arrangement on head joint, Dovetail arrangement, Projecting nibs on bed joint, Synthetic strips between blocks. Grouted systems. Interlocking blocks of highly complex shape<br>
Automation in masonry construction is mostly restricted to the prefabrication industry. The concept and technique of prefabricating brick masonry sections was developed in France, Switzerland and Denmark in the 1950s and adopted in the United States in the early 1960s [Beall (1987)]. Prefabrication methods have been successfully applied to wall panels, columns and beam sections. Prefabricated masonry is presently manufactured by the following two distinct methods.<br>
I	Manual construction employs manpower for pre-assembling  masonry<br>
sections at a plant or at a remote work yard or on the job site away from the final in-place location of the masonry. Pre-assembly allows continuous and quality work even during bad weather conditions thereby increasing productivity.<br>
II        Casting methods lend themselves to the use of automated systems including forming, mechanical unit placing and machine grouting.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,262,463 describes pressed blocks for interlocked assembly. The block comprises at least one male assembly means protecting from the first face. Each of the male assembly means has a vertical section and 2 horizontal sections arranged at both ends of the vertical section the female assembly means is arranged on the second face of the block and has a substantially rectangular cross section.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,896,472 describes a construction system based on the combined use of blocks designed to lock together. There are three basic blocks, the full, half and knock-out blocks, with which any desirable structure can be built. The full block has protruding ears and grooves. The half block and the knock-out block have grooves only. There are standard measurements between groove faces in all blocks and standard measurements between ears in the full block which correspond to the measurements of the groove faces. This provides for a wide array of interlocking positions.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,802,797 describes a masonry system in which specially shaped brick are dry-stacked and subsequently bonded by pouring mortar or grout into apertures in the brick to flow through the stacked structure to surround the individual brick leaving the front and rear faces exposed. The brick have alignment projections extending from the bottom bed faces which register with alignment grooves in the top bed faces of the lower brick to align the upper brick prior to bonding. The projections and grooves define a recess to admit mortar between adjacent brick faces. The brick also have recesses in the header faces to admit mortar between adjacent header faces. The front faces of the brick are contoured to create the appearance of mortar joints when the brick are stacked. The brick may be manufactured by extrusion, wire cutting and final shaping using suitable blades to achieve the desired finished shape. If desired, certain apertures through the brick may be covered over using a suitably shaped blade operating under appropriate conditions.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,065,265 describes an interlocking building block for use in constructing mortarless walls in which the block has a first face shell in spaced relationship with a second face shell which define opposed inner surfaces for the block. Between the face shells, there stands at least one transversely-disposed bridge portion and a transverse end portion which defines an operatively outer surface for the block and which closes one end of the block between the first and<br>
second face shells.   A grouting cavity is formed between the transverse end portion and abridge portion.   Both the transversely - disposed bridge portions and the transverse end portion have integrally-formed projections which extend above the height of the block on an operatively-upper surface and corresponding recesses are formed in an operatively lower surface of the block.  Channels are formed in the opposed inner surfaces of the face shells which are adapted to receive and locate corresponding projections of an underlying interlocking block which is oriented orthogonally to the block, and the channels also define a reduced wall thickness in the first and second face shells which may be partially broken away to receive a reinforcement bar for reinforcing grout which is added to the grouting cavity.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 6,240,658 describes tongue and groove arrangement.  In this an interlocking and insulating from pattern assembly used in creating a wall structure for receiving a poured concrete.  A first elongate form structure has a substantially rectangular configuration with a height, alength and a width.   The first form structure includes a plurality of interiorly and arcuately formed walls which define in combination of first and second pluralities of interconnecting and vertically  and  longitudinally  spaced  and  parallel  extending  concrete  filling pessage ways.   Tongue and groove portions are extended from first and second sides of each form structure and along selected oppositely facing surfaces so as to provide a stocking arrangement of a plurality of form structures.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 6,244,009 a masonry wall system is disclosed incorporating a plurality of courses of masonry blocks, each block consisting of interlocking dovetail along with vertical and horizontal melting surfaces.<br>
No literature is available on automated masonry construction where bonding of masonry can be achieved automatically. Masonry units are bonded by providing mortar in each layer or masonry units are left unbounded.<br>
In the present invention, masonry units have been developed such that automatic masonry construction including the automatic bonding of masonry units has been achieved.<br>
Masonry building blocks such as bricks have non uniform demensions resulting from shrinkage, warping and it is necessary in preformed masonry building tanks having precise predetermined dimensions so that a uniform wall or the like is constructed.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a dimensionally accurate masonry block unit such as brick with predetermined dimensions. The building blocks in combination with new meterials with predictable performance properties and technology result in a building block unit from which the constructions will be stronger more, watertight and dimensionally accurate than the priort art.<br>
There always existed a need to have the construction automatic for uniform and better quality of work, reduced man power requirement, reduced time of construction. Automation has been introduced to a very limited extent in the field of masonry construction<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the building units can have various predetermined dimensions depending upon the type of construction to be carried out.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the building units can be manufactured faster than the conventional method.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that abundantly available flyash is used as one of the constituents.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is the ease with which the construction work can take place. The time required in the conventional methods of construction is considerably reduced.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that even an unskilled worker can do construction without any problem.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the strength of construction is increased at least two folds than the conventional construction.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the overall cost of the masonry work is reduced.<br>
The present invention encapsulates the above advantages over the known shapes and configurations of masonry building units and the process for their manufacture and the apparatus used thereof<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to fig 2, 3, 4 and 5 are simplified diagram of the masonry block unit or brick.  Fig 1 shows upper face of the brick (Top view). A depression (2) along its longitudinal axis is provided in the middle width of the upper face which is interfitted with the projection (4) provided along its longitudinal axis in the middle width of the lower face of another mating masonry building  unit in dimensionally accurate relationship. As the height of the projection is less than the depth of the depression,  a void or gap is formed all around the brick unit.  Such gap is about 3 to 6 mm depending on the size of masonry unit.  Similarly to a vertical depression(6) of predetermined width is provided in the middle of one of the side surfaces of the brick to be interfitted with mating vertical projection(8) of the middle width of Ithe other side surface.  Front and back surfaces of the masonry units are planar. The projection and depressions are in the middle of the surface over a width of 0.6 to 0.8 times the width of masonry unit.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the apparatus used for manufacturing interlocking and interfiitting masonry building unit or brick consisting of a metallic mould (9) mounted on a frame (10). The top view of the mould (9) used is shown in Fig. 6. It can be of different shapes and sizes for bricks/blocks of different shapes and sizes and can be interchanged. The length of mould(9) is such that the desired length of masonry buiding unit is achieved after compaction. The cross section of the masonry building  unit is  100/100. A double acting  hydraulic jack (11)<br>
supported on frame is provided as shown in Fig. 7. It has adequate ram length to achieve desired compaction of brick/masonry building units. The bottom plate of mould is attached with the hydraulic jack (11) which can be moved up and down by central valve. A electrical/diesel operated pump system (12) with control valve is connected with hydraulic pump and can be used to operate the hydraulic jack (11).<br>
The operation of machine for making brick/block unit is simple. The top lid of the mould (9) is opened and the bottom plate of mould (9) is kept in lowest bottom position by releasing the hydraulic jack (11). Then a homogenous mixture of 45-50% flyash, 10-15% cement, 35-40% sand, the balance being water is prepared and brick/masonry building unit is filled in the mould (9)and the top lid is closed and locked such that the lid is held down.   The hydraulic jack (11)  is operated with control valve for upward movement of the ram to achieve the desired compaction of brick/masonry building unit. The desired compaction is achieved at a pressure of about 10-50 Mpa causing it  to define dimensionally accurate depressions  and  projections  of interfitting  for  mounting   of adjacent  and superadjacent masonry building units. The said bricks are removed from the mould (9)and cured for about 2-7 days.<br>
Fig. 8 show a wall constructed by the above masonry bulding units or bricks by placing a lower layer of the said bricks in end to end relationship with interfitting mating block units. A number of superadjacent layers of building units are placed on to the said  lower layer with  interfitting projections on the continuguous upper face of masonry block units. After the desired height is achieved the semifluid mortar having 1 part cement w/w, 0.3 to 0.5 part water w/w and 0.02-0.05 % of non shrinkage material of pouring consistency is made and poured from the top or side of the wall. The mortar is then allowed to set . The thickness of the mortar varies from 3-5mm depending upon the size of the masonry. The strength of such masonry is about 80% of the strength of masonry<br>
unit whereas the strength of the masonry as per the existing methods is only 30-40% of the strength of the masonry unit.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
