Description<br>
Energy Meter Array and Method for Calibration<br>
The invention pertains to an energy meter array and method for calibrating the energy meter<br>
array.<br>
Energy meters serve the purpose of measuring consumed or generated electrical energy. Such<br>
energy meters are referred to as electricity meters or kilowatt hour meters.<br>
In electronic energy meters, generally voltage and current are measured and digitised and<br>
multiplied with one another. After multiplication one gets the momentary electrical power. If<br>
one integrates or accumulates this electrical power over time, then one obtains a signal that is<br>
a measure for the electrical energy generated or consumed in a certain time interval.<br>
In order to obtain proportional signals for electrical voltage and electrical current, voltage<br>
dividers, voltage converters, current converters or other agents can be used for signal<br>
uncoupling.<br>
In many applications it is necessary, at least in one of the two channels, to provide a galvanic<br>
separation for measuring voltage and current. Such a galvanic separation of current circuits is<br>
provided, for example, by a transformer.<br>
The problem with such a transformer is however the phase shift caused by the inductive<br>
coupling of the transformer. The phase shift occurs, on the one hand, between the output<br>
signal and the input signal of the transformer. On the other hand, the phase shift also occurs<br>
between the signal representing the current and the signal representing the voltage. This<br>
however results in undesired measuring errors during the multiplication of voltage and<br>
current. It should be noted here that voltage and current are mostly present not as direct<br>
signals but more as alternate current signals with more or less harmonic signal form.<br>
The described problem gets additionally intensified, in that even if a transformatory<br>
transmitter is used in the voltage and current measuring channel, an exactly predictable phase<br><br><br>
shift does not happen between both input channels due to production tolerances, temperature<br>
effects, aging effects or other unavoidable effects of a mass production.<br>
For correcting the described, undesirable phase shift one can for example use RC-networks<br>
that consist of resistances and capacitors. However, these have to be generally designed as<br>
additional external components and can generally not be integrated. Moreover, the problem<br>
of tolerances related to production and temperature are basically not solved thereby.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create an energy counter array that can be integrated with<br>
least complication, as well as a method for calibration, in such a way that voltage and/or the<br>
current can be measured with galvanic separation without any measuring errors.<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention with the help of an energy meter array that has<br>
a first input for feeding a signal derived from a voltage, to which a first analogous/digital<br>
converter is connected that has an output;<br>
a second input for feeding a signal derived from a current, to which a second<br>
analogous/digital converter is connected that has an output;<br>
a multiplier that connects the output of both analogous/digital converters with one<br>
another;<br>
a phase evaluation block with two inputs that are coupled with the output of both the<br>
analogous/digital converters, and with an output that is coupled with a control input with a<br>
phase correction block; and<br>
-    the phase correction block that is coupled on to an output of one of both the<br>
analogous/digital converters, designed for correcting a phase fluctuation of the digitised<br>
signal derived from a current or voltage.<br>
According to the suggested principle, a phase shift between the input of the energy meter<br>
array, to which a signal derived from an electrical voltage is fed, and the input of the energy<br>
meter array to which a signal derived from an electrical current is fed, is measured and<br>
compensated. The signal input for feeding the signal derived from the voltage and the signal<br>
derived from the current could also be referred to as input channel, namely voltage channel<br>
and current channel.<br>
The phase evaluation and correction is carried out completely in digital signal processing.<br><br><br>
With the suggested measurement and compensation of the phase shift between both channels<br>
it is advantageously possible to galvanically isolate the channels from one another and/or at<br>
least one input from the energy meter array. By balancing the phase shift, measuring errors in<br>
the array are avoided. The advantage here is that one does not need any external<br>
compensation networks like resistance-capacity networks for the phase shift.<br>
The phase evaluation block and the phase correction block effect a so-called on-chip-phase<br>
correction of the energy meter array without external components.<br>
For example, in a calibration operation mode, the phase shift between both input channels can<br>
be measured, in that an identical input signal is placed on both inputs. Preferably a sine signal<br>
is fed to both inputs of the energy meter array in the calibration operation mode.<br>
The advantage here is that the zero-transmissions of both digitised signals can be compared<br>
with the phase evaluation block. Alternatively, it is also possible to evaluate the respective<br>
phase positions of the signal peak values of the digitised signal.<br>
Thus it is possible to define the relative time interval of the zero-transmissions from one<br>
another. The calculation of the phase difference from the time interval of the zero-<br>
transmissions of both signals can effected by means of a logic unit in the phase evaluation<br>
block. With the measured phase difference it is subsequently possible without any problem to<br>
carry out a correction of exactly this phase difference in one of both the channels.<br>
The phase correction value can be stored in the phase evaluation block, so that the correction<br>
value is available in normal operation even after the calibration operation mode.<br>
As no external components are required for phase correction, implementation of the suggested<br>
energy meter array is possible in a very cost-effective manner. Therefore, the suggested,<br>
integrate-able energy meter array is particularly suited for mass production.<br>
An additional advantage is that the time required for calibrating the energy meter array is very<br>
little according to the suggested principle. In principle, the same difference between both<br>
input channels can be measured within only one period duration of the input signal, preferably<br><br><br>
the test signal. The period duration can be calculated in a very simple manner from the<br>
inverse proportion of the respective signal frequency. The signal frequency in energy meters<br>
is generally 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz, depending on the national standards.<br>
According to the suggested principle, a phase fluctuation is determined between the input<br>
signals of the energy meter array, already available as digital signals. The correction of the<br>
phase error is similarly done in the area of digital signal processing.<br>
In order to achieve particularly quick measurement of the phase fluctuation of the input<br>
channel of the energy meter array, it is advantageous to connect the pulse input of the phase<br>
evaluation block with the pulse input of the analogous-/digital-converters and thus use for the<br>
phase evaluation, the pulse signal of the analogous-/digital-converters that is required in any<br>
case for operating the energy meter array.<br>
The phase evaluation block comprises an agent for permanent storing of a phase correction<br>
value. The agent for permanent storage of a phase correction value is preferably designed as<br>
non-volatile storage, e.g. as EEPROM.<br>
Due to the permanent storage of the phase correction value, the phase correction value<br>
measured in a calibration operation mode is also available after the energy meter array is<br>
switched off and switched on again.<br>
The analogous-/digital-converters are preferably designed as sigma-delta-converters or as<br>
sigma-delta-modulators. This allows scanning of the input signals derived from voltage and<br>
current with high resolution and good integrate-ability.<br>
An integrator is foreseen at the output of the multiplier, which integrates the signals provided<br>
by the multiplier. The integrator can be designed as accumulator.<br>
The integrator is designed in such a way that it integrates the signal provided by the<br>
multiplier, representing the momentary electrical power, with a signal that is a measure for the<br>
electrical energy consumed or generated.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the first and the second analogous-/digital-converters, the phase correction block<br>
and the phase evaluation block, are designed in integrated circuit technology.<br>
Even the sigma-delta-converters and further functional blocks and/or components in the signal<br>
processing chain of the energy meter array can be designed, as far as possible, preferably in<br>
integrated circuit technology. The energy meter array can be implemented in a single<br>
integrated semi-conductor circuit.<br>
To the first input of the energy meter array and/or to the second input of the energy meter<br>
array, the output of a transmitter effecting a galvanic separation can be connected. Such a<br>
non-galvanic transmitter could ideally be a transformer.<br>
The relatively high phase fluctuation of such coupled members effecting a galvanic separation<br>
of the input can be compensated with the help of the suggested principle in a very simple,<br>
effective and highly precise manner.<br>
An agent for generating a test signal is foreseen, that is coupled with the first and the second<br>
input of the energy meter array.<br>
If launching members are foreseen, for example transformatory transmitters, then the agent<br>
for generating the test signal is preferably designed in such a way that the test signal is fed in<br>
at the input of the transmitter or launching member. It could be thereby advantageous if a<br>
switch-over possibility of the input between an effective signal operation mode and a<br>
calibration operation mode is foreseen, in which the inputs are connected to the agent for<br>
generating the test signal.<br>
A digital filter is connected after the analogous-/digital-converters. The digital filters have a<br>
control input each for controlling the scan rate of the digitised signal. Particularly, between<br>
the normal operation mode and the calibration operation mode, an alteration of the scan rate<br>
can be carried out.<br>
Ideally, the phase correction block can include one of the digital filters.<br><br><br>
The agent for generating the test signal can be activate-able in a calibration/operation mode,<br>
while in the normal operation mode, i.e. in the actual energy measuring operation it can be<br>
deactivated.<br>
With respect to the method, the task of the invention is fulfilled by means of a method for<br>
calibrating an energy meter array with the help of following steps:<br>
-	Launching of a test signal at two inputs of an energy meter array;<br>
-	digitisation of the test signal at both inputs;<br>
-	measuring of a phase fluctuation between both the digitised test signals;<br>
generation of a phase correction signal and feeding the phase correction signal to one of<br>
both the digitised test signals.<br>
Measurement of the phase fluctuation can take place, for example, by comparing the phase<br>
positions of the signal-zero-transmissions of both signals.<br>
Alternatively, the phase fluctuations can be measured by comparing the phase positions of the<br>
signal peak values with one another.<br>
Determination of the phase position as well as measurement of the phase fluctuation can<br>
thereby be done completely in digital signal processing.<br>
Even other methods can be used for measuring a phase fluctuation between two digitised<br>
signals that can be implemented in digital signal technology.<br>
One can measure the phase fluctuations in a particularly precise manner, in that in the<br>
calibration operation mode, the scan rate of the digitised signals is influenced.<br>
For example, in the calibration operation mode the sigma-delta-over scan rate can be reduced<br>
as there is a low dynamics range. One gets a greater number of scan values in a 50-Hertz-<br>
pulse period, so that the precision of measuring the phase fluctuation is increased.<br>
After digitisation, a digital filtering is foreseen with adjustable decimation rate.<br><br><br>
In all, the suggested principle provides the advantage of a significant cost reduction, as no<br>
external components are required for a phase correction. Moreover, the calibration can be<br>
carried out in a particularly short time, even within a 50-Hertz- or 60-Hertz-pulse period.<br>
Further details and advantageous extensions of the suggested principle are subject of the sub-<br>
claims.<br>
The invention is explained below on the basis of a design example and the accompanying figure.<br>
The following are shown:<br>
The figure -    A block circuit diagram of a desired example of the suggested energy meter<br>
array.<br>
The figure shows an energy meter array with a first input 1 and a second input 2. The first<br>
input 1 is designed for feeding a signal derived from an electrical voltage V. The second input<br>
2 is designed for feeding a signal derived from an electrical current I. The electrical voltage<br>
V and the electrical current I refer to the same signal. To the first input 1, the input of a first<br>
analogous-/digital-converter 3 is connected. To the second input 2 the input of a second<br>
analogous-/digital-converter 4 is connected. The analogous-/digital-converters 3, 4 are<br>
respectively designed as sigma-delta-modulators. The output of the first analogous-/digital-<br>
converter 3 is connected to the input of a multiplier 7 through a first digital filter 5. The<br>
output of the second analogous-/digital-converter 4 is connected to a further input of the<br>
multiplier 7 through a second digital filer. The second digital filter consists of a phase<br>
correction block 6 that has a control input. To the output of a multiplier 7, an integrator 8 is<br>
connected that converts a signal at its input, which is a measure for the momentary electrical<br>
power P, into a signal that represents the electrical energy E. Additionally, a phase evaluation<br>
block 9 is foreseen.<br>
The phase evaluation block 9 has a phase position detector 10 for determining the respective<br>
phase position of the signal peak values. The phase position detector 10 has two inputs that<br>
are connected to the outputs of a digital filter 5 and of the phase correction block 6. Two<br>
outputs of the phase position detector 10 are connected to two inputs of a phase difference<br>
detector 11 that serves the purpose of measuring phase fluctuation. The phase difference<br><br><br>
detector has an output that is several bits wide. The output of the different phase detector 11<br>
is connected to the input of a control block 12 that is connected to the control input of the<br>
same for activating the phase correction block 6.<br>
The control block 12 consists of a non-volatile storage 18, in which the measured phase<br>
fluctuation or the corresponding correction value can be permanently stored.<br>
A scan rate control 19 has two outputs that are respectively connected to control inputs of the<br>
phase correction block 6 with digital filter and the second digital filter 5. In this way, the scan<br>
rate of the second digital filter 5 and of the phase correction block 6 with digital filter can be<br>
laid down. The adjustment of the scan rate takes place in relationship to the respective<br>
operation mode.<br>
The energy meter arrangement described so far is arranged in integrated technology on a<br>
single chip. For uncoupling the electrical voltage, a voltage divider 14 is foreseen, whose<br>
output is connected to the first input 1 of the energy meter array and whose input forms a<br>
voltage input 13 for feeding the electrical voltage. For uncoupling the electrical current, a<br>
transformer 16 is foreseen, which is switched between a current input 15 and a second input 2<br>
of the energy meter array. The transformer 16 provides a galvanic de-coupling between the<br>
current input 15 and the second input 2.<br>
To the voltage input 13 and the current input 15, the output of a test signal generator 17 is<br>
connected. The test signal generator 17 provides a harmonic, mainly sine-shaped signal with<br>
a rated frequency of 50 or 60 Hertz, depending on the country specification.<br>
On account of the voltage divider 14 and the transformer 16, for both input channels of the<br>
energy meter one obtains different phase shifts. Particularly important is a relative phase<br>
difference (Acp) between both the input channels at the inputs 1, 2 of the energy meter array.<br>
This phase fluctuation (Acp) is measuredwith the phase evaluation block 9.<br>
Measuring of the phase fluctuation (Acp) takes place in a calibration operation mode, in that<br>
the test signal generator 17 is activated and thereafter a phase-in, sine-shaped signal is fed to<br>
the voltage input 13 and the current input 15. This signal experiences a different phase shift<br>
in the voltage divider 14 and the transformer 16.<br><br><br>
The relative phase fluctuation (Acp) at the inputs 1,2 is measured in the phase evaluation block<br>
9 in the detectors 10, 11, in that the time span between the zero-transmissions or peak values<br>
of both signals at the inputs of the phase evaluation block 9 are measured and converted into a<br>
corresponding phase shift. A corresponding correction value is provided by the control block<br>
12 and given out at the output of the phase evaluation block 9. Thus a phase correction block<br>
6 is activated in the digital filter that balances the phase difference (Acp).<br>
As measurement of the current in the normal operation mode has to take place precisely over<br>
a large dynamics range, the over-scan rate of the sigma-delta-modulators is relatively high. In<br>
this way, also a suitable signal-noise ratio can be achieved.<br>
In the calibration operation mode, in which a harmonic test signal is fed, the requirement of a<br>
large dynamics range is not relevant. Rather, peaks or zero-transmissions of the digitised test<br>
signal has to be measured and compared in both channels, in order to be able to measure a<br>
phase fluctuation.<br>
On account of the fact that in the calibration operation mode a lesser dynamics range is<br>
required, the over-scan rate of the modulator can be reduced. In this way, more scan values<br>
are available within one pulse period. The precision of identification of the phase fluctuation<br>
is determined by the frequency of the scan pulse.<br>
For a 50 Hz test signal, an over-scan rate of 16 and a scan frequency of 28 KHz, one obtains<br>
559 scan values in one pulse period of the test signal. A scan value thereby corresponds to<br>
0.64 degrees, namely the quotient of 360 and 559. For a phase shift of 0.64 degrees between<br>
voltage channel and current channel the measured, electrical power 0.00054 dB would be<br>
below the optimum. For an power factor 1 this corresponds to a relative error of 0.00624%,<br>
which is negligible. The precision of the phase correction can be further increased by a<br>
suitable correction of the scan values.<br>
The power factor, in conformity with general convention, is defined in such a way that for a<br>
power factor 1 current and voltage are in-phase, i.e. between current and voltage there is a<br>
phase shift of 0 degrees. In case of phase fluctuation between current and voltage of say<br><br><br>
60 degrees, the power factor will accordingly be 0.5 and thus correspond to the cosine of the<br>
phase difference.<br>
Accordingly, the relative error for a power factor of 1 and a phase shift of 0.64 degrees can be<br>
calculated according to the equation<br>
	= 0.00624%.<br>
The calibration operation mode is activated only once during the production of the energy<br>
meter array.<br>
With the suggested principle, an automatic phase correction for integrated energy meter arrays<br>
is provided, which is realised completely integrated and completely in digital signal<br>
processing.<br>
A special feature of the suggested energy meter arrangement is also the low calibration time<br>
and the low cost of manufacture. Moreover, a galvanic isolation of at least <br>
input of the energy meter array is possible without any measuring errors .<br>
The galvanic isolation is also of great importance, if more than one channel is measured, as is<br>
generally the case in electrical energy meters.<br>
Especially, a phase shift that is unavoidably caused by transformers can be compensated. For<br>
this no additional external components like resistance-capacitor aer required for phase<br>
correction.	<br>
Due to the non-volatile storage 18 the phase correction value is still available even if the<br>
energy meter is switched off.<br>
As measurement of phase fluctuation is basically possible within a period duration, one can<br>
achieve a particularly quick calibration with the help of the suggested principle.<br>
The phase evaluation block 9 has a pulse input that is connected to the pulse inputs of the<br>
sigma-delta-modulators 3, 4. In this way, the pulse flanks between two zero-transmissions<br>
can be counted and thus the phase fluctuations can be precisely measured in a simple manner.<br><br>
According to the suggested principle, in the digital signal range, measurement of the relative<br>
phase fluctuation on both the outputs of the analogous/digital-converters is carried out.<br>
Correction of the phase fluctuation similarly takes place in digital signal processing.<br><br>
