This invention relates to a spindle drive system for ring spinning and twisting machines.<br>
In yarn manufacturing technology, an assembly of parallel fibres are converted into yarns by ring spinning machines. Ring spinning machines are provided with a plurality of spindles to which roving material is fed from above, and the fibrous material is attenuated to the desired fineness. Drafted roving is twisted by a traveller in the ring frame. The twisted filament is finally wound on bobbins.<br>
Similarly, ring twisting machines are employed for twisting yarns. Twisting machines essentially consist of rolls that deliver yarn at a constant speed, a guide for the yarn and a traveller that turns freely on a ring, and a rotating spindle to hold the yarn package.<br>
The spindle of ring spinning and twisting machines are conventionally driven by an endless belt through a central rotating cylinder or individual pulleys. These belts or tapes may be made of cotton or nylon. In the existing ring spinning and twisting machines, a single tape or belt is made to drive four spindles, two on either side of the frame. An individual pulley is provided for each of the spindles to be driven if a central rotating cylinder is not used.<br><br>
The textile industry uses three basic groups of spindle drive systems, viz. the tape drives, the tangential drives and direct drives. Group drives are also employed by the spinning industry where two types of drives are used together. For instance a four spindle tape drive and tangential drive are used together. Four spindle tape drive is found advantages in comprison with tangential belt drives becuase of its reduced energy consumption and lower noise level. Tapes or belts of tape drives are easier to be replaced and maintained. Tape drives may be further classified under single spindle drives and group spindle drives. Direct drive systems include direct mechanical drives which may be individual or direct individual motor drives. Recent practice provides individual motor drives for each spindle.<br>
In conventional spinning machines using tape or belt drive system, considerable energy is utilised in overcoming drive pulley friction and air drag on the rotating roller surface. Power requirements of spinning units are directly proportional to the spindle speed and this has a strong bearing on the economics of spinning and twisting operations. It is found tht about 12% of total power consumed during ring spinning and twisting operations is due to the air drag offered by individual pulleys or the roller cylinder.  Another draw back of the existing system<br><br>
where a rotating cylinder is used is the vibration of the machine covered by the rotation of heavy rollers. Rollers and individual pulleys driving the belt generate considerable noise during operation. It is also noticed that a lot of fly dust is produced due to excess vibration of the machine parts.<br>
The objects of this invention are to develop an energy efficient drive system for spinning and twisting machines with reduced vibration level, noise pollution, and improved working atmosphere by reduction of fly dust level.<br>
With these objects in mind a drive system for ring spinning and twisting machine has been developed by us. The system drives at least four spindles on one side of the machine and at least four on the other side. The spindles are driven by an endless belt connected to a single drive pulley mounted on a shaft. At least two idle pulleys are provided.one each on either side of the machine. This enables the spindles located on both the sides to be driven at a constant required speed. The endless belt passes through at least one or two tension pulleys. The tension pulleys are preferably located before the idle pulleys and they regulate the tension of the driven endless belt. It is to be understood that alternate individual pulleys are eliminated in the present system thus reducing power consumption and noise pollution.   This also helps in reducing the over-all  production<br><br>
Cost as less number of pulleys are operated. Better quality yarn is also produced since breakage of yarn due to fly dust impact is minimised. Further, the machinery is simple to operate, maintain and repair.<br>
The  spindle drive system for ring  spinning  and  twisting<br>
machine  according to this invention comprises a rotatable  shaft<br>
single having  arrive pulley mounted thereon, an endless belt  drivable<br>
by the pulley, at least two idle pulleys located one  on  either<br>
side of the said ring spinning and twisting machine, and at least<br>
one  tension  regulating pulley, the said endless  belt drivably<br>
connected  to  at least four spindles on each side  of  the  said<br>
machine.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Reference numeral 1 in the figure represents the drive shaft while the single drive pulley is shwon by numeral 2. The endless belt or tape is shown by numeral 11. Four spindles on one side A of the machine are indicated by 3, 4, 5 and 6, whereas the spindles on the opposite side, B of the machine are shown by 7, 8, 9 and 10. The idle pulleys on either side of the machine are indicated by reference numberal 12 and 12 .  Two tension  pulleys<br><br>
which regulate the tension of the endless belt are shown by numeral 13. The system is operated in a manner known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Clearly, the invention is not limited to the embodiment described and illustrated herein above but may be altered or modified in many ways known to persons skilled in the art with out departing from the underlying concept of the invention claimed in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A spindle drive system for  ring  spinning  and  twisting<br>
single machines comprising a rotatable shaft having a /drive pulley<br>

spinning and twisting machine and at least one tension regulating<br>
pulley, the said endless belt drivably connected to at least four<br>
spindles on each side of the said machine.<br>
2.	The spindle drive system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
endless belt is a cotton or nylon tape.<br>
3.	The  spindle drive system as claimed in any of  the preceding<br>
claims wherein two tension regulating pulleys are provided.<br>
