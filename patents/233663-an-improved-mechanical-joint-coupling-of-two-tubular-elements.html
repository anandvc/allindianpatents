				<td>This invention relates to joints and more particularly to pipe joints,<br>
which are widely known, as stuffing box type joints. This joint is used in<br>
jointing sections of pipes of socket and spigot type or plain ended wherein<br>
a collar type coupling is used. This invention would be applicable to pipes<br>
made of metal, particularly ductile iron, ceramic materials, concrete,<br>
plastic or other compositions.<br>
It is well known in the art to which this invention relates that<br>
difficulties have been encountered in providing a simple economical<br>
flexible joint for spigot and socket or plain-ended pipe which is required to<br>
withstand high pressure and which would not impart rigidity to the<br>
pipeline in which it is employed. For the last forty years, pipe joints for<br>
moderate pressure, such as those found in city water mains, have been<br>
push-on rubber gasket joint. Where higher pressures are employed it has<br>
been customary to restore to bolted flanged joint or mechanical joint,<br>
which is the stuffing box type.<br>
The common disadvantages experienced in the slip-on or push-on<br>
joints are as follows:<br>
(1) For successful performance of push-on joint, the pipe dimensions<br>
need to be maintained at very rigid tolerance. If the dimensions<br><br>
vary even slightly more than the close tolerances, or oval pipe,<br>
which, particularly possesses large diameter, ductile iron pipes<br>
often become, the joint cannot be assembled as a result the joint<br>
leaks;<br>
(2)	The main disadvantages of push-on joint pipe is, this needs special<br>
tools for its assembly;<br>
(3)	In case the gasket gets displaced during assembly, there is no easy<br>
method of checking;<br>
(4)	In case of any leakage at the joint, there is no means for repair of<br>
the joint. The only remedy is, to cut out the joint part and replace<br>
it with a barrel pipe and two mechanical joint collars; and<br>
(5)	The whole repair operation of leaking joint is time consuming and<br>
costly.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to mitigate the<br>
known disadvantages of the prior push-on joints as described hereinabove.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
mechanical joint.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
improvement to what is commonly known as the mechanical joint or<br>
bolted gland joint.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to avoid the inherent<br>
disadvantages associated with the known mechanical joints.<br>
In the course of the investigations leading to the present invention it<br>
is found that all the disadvantages of push-on joint can be eliminated by<br>
the use of mechanical joint or commonly known as bolted gland joint. But<br>
there are disadvantages of this mechanical joint, which are as follows:<br>
(a)	Since mechanical joint pipe needs a socket having a peripheral<br>
flange cast with the pipe, it needs a special mould to manufacture<br>
pipes to suit this type of joint by spun cast process.<br>
(b)	The joint also needs a follower gland, which needs to be cast<br>
separately.<br>
( c ) Both of the peripheral flange and follower gland are required to be<br>
drilled similar to flange drilling which calls for additional<br>
procedure, equipment and cost.<br><br>
(d)	A set of tee headed bolts and nuts are necessary to complete the<br>
jointing.<br>
(e)	The joint can be dismantelled very easily with a spanner by<br>
removing the nut.<br>
(f)	The joint is not tamperproof.<br>
The mechanical joint so made is flexible and very efficient, but due<br>
to many accessories and additional machining its operational cost becomes<br>
very high. The invention disclosed hereafter describes how all the<br>
advantages of mechanical joint are retained, eliminating the disadvantages<br>
in the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, a principal object of this invention is to provide a pipe<br>
joint, which is free from the noted disadvantages applicable to joints as<br>
heretofore constructed.<br>
Another object of the invention is to improve the design of pipe<br>
joints of this character to render them more economical to manufacture,<br>
and to facilitate the assembly of pipe sections without requiring skilled<br>
labour for this purpose.<br><br>
Other object, characteristics and advantages of the invention are sufficiently<br>
explained in the following detail description and the accompanying drawings,<br>
which show representative embodiments. After consideration of these examples<br>
skilled persons will understand that many variations may be made without<br>
departing from the principles disclosed.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an improved mechanical joint<br>
coupling of two tubular elements, one of said tubular elements having a spigot<br>
end and the other being provided with a socket; said coupling comprising a set<br>
of withdrawable pins capable of being fixed in the holes provided on the rim of<br>
said socket, a gasket made of a resilient material being housed within the space<br>
between said two tubular elements and a circular pressure plate; said pins being<br>
capable of holding the pressure plate and the said gasket in predetermined<br>
position and thus preventing said circular pressure plate and said gasket to<br>
loosen out of the annular space between said socket and spigot.<br>
In the approved mechanical joint coupling of the present invention the pressure<br>
plate is capable of rotation around its axis and is provided with multiple faces of<br>
different thicknesses. Further, for gasket of said<br><br>
Joint coupling is of wedge-shaped and made of rubber or like material and said<br>
withdrawal pins are preferably made of stainless steel.<br>
In the improving coupling of the present invention a skirt is adapted at the front<br>
end of said socket through which a stainless steel bolt passes, said bolt being<br>
capable of holding the pressure plate which is of uniform thickness and<br>
comprises of more than one part and said rubber gasket in the annular space<br>
between said socket and spigot in predetermined position.<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 explains the old method of mechanical joint assembled tightened and<br>
compressed.<br>
In Fig. 1 there is illustrated a somewhat conventional metal pipe socket (1)<br>
having peripheral flange (2) with apertures (3,30 for securing bolts and a first<br>
inner shoulder (4) complementally engagable with inclined inner shoulder (5) of<br>
compressible gasket (6). The socket interior defines an opening wall of maximum<br>
radius relative to a center line of the joint, joining in a first conical shoulder (4)<br>
of declining radius said first conical shoulder terminating rearwardly in a second<br>
shoulder (5)<br><br>
of shortest radius, whereby to form within the socket a rearwardly extending<br>
recess for the plain pipe end. Gasket (6) has an opposed inclined outer shoulder<br>
(5). A ductile iron, or of similar material, gland (7) having peripheral apertures<br>
(8,8') aligned with socket apertures (3,3') is shown as having a conical, axial<br>
aperture which terminates short of its forward end to form in extension thereof<br>
an inclined peripheral abutment (10).<br>
As best illustrated in the Fig.1 assembly, gland (7) inner surface (10)<br>
complementally engages the outer rubber sealing gasket (6) as the bolts (11,12)<br>
are placed through apertures (3,3', 8,8') and are tightened by means of nuts<br>
(13,14).<br>
Standard tee headed bolts (11,12) are engaged through mating holes (3,30 and<br>
(8,8') in gland and pipe fitting. Now, as bolts (11,12) are tightened gland (7) is<br>
drawn inwardly toward socket (1). This assembly action continues. The<br>
complemental, substantial parallelism of opposed contacting and corresponding<br>
surfaces of gland gasket and socket facilitate meeting the advantages set forth<br>
below. Rubber gasket (6) is now tightly compressed into bell socket offering a<br>
flexible leak-proof joint.<br><br>
Fig.2 illustrates the basic invention. Fig.2 shows the components<br>
of the joint is assembled position.<br>
(1)	This invention comprises an improved method of compressing the<br>
Rubber gasket in the socket and spigot combination to offer a<br>
flexible bottle tight leak proof joint.<br>
(2)	The construction of the newly invented joint -<br>
eliminates the peripheral flange which is normally cast with the<br>
socket which had to be machined, faced and drilled.<br>
(3)	In the new joint the follower gland is cast machined and thus<br>
drilling has been eliminated.<br>
(4)	All the tee headed bolts and nuts are eliminated and instead a few<br>
stainless steel shear pins have been utilized.<br>
(5)	The pressure plate made of stiff metal or nonmetal material, which<br>
presses the wedged shaped rubber gasket. The pressure plate can be<br>
made in parts out of plastic or plastic coated iron to eliminate<br>
deterioration due to corrosion. The pressure plate may be made of<br>
varying thickness so that, it can be rotated to increase the effective<br><br>
thickness of the plate and thereby make the joint tighter, suitable for<br>
higher pressure.<br>
For a particular maximum pressure rating the pressure plate thick-<br>
ness can be specified. If arrangement for variable pressure is<br>
necessary that can also done.<br>
(6)	The overall cost of the joint is drastically reduced from the conven-<br>
tional mechanical joint.<br>
(7)	Since tee headed bolts and nuts have been eliminated the tampering<br>
the joint by opening of the nut is not possible. But for a knowledge-<br>
able semiskilled technician the joint can be opened form outside by<br>
removing the shear pins with the help of a lever. The pressure<br>
rating can be changed by increasing the effective thickness of the<br>
pressure plate and even change the gasket as and when necessary.<br>
Several embodiments of the invention will be described below by<br>
way of example.<br><br>
Fig.2 relating to a coupling or joint between two pipes (1) and (2).<br>
The tubular spigot end of the pipe (1) is inserted in a socket (2) of the<br>
pipe, which contains an elastrometric-sealing element (4). In front of the<br>
elastrometric ring a pressure plate (3) is placed which when compressed<br>
from outside transfers the pressure to the wedged shape sealing ring (4)<br>
which is turn seals the annular gap between the socket and spigot and seals<br>
the joint.<br>
The socket (2) has a set of radial holes (6,7) near the edge of the<br>
socket opening through which a set of stainless steel pins (5) can pass and<br>
can be shrunk fitted in these holes (6,7) of the socket. The pins (5)<br>
prevent the sealing gasket (4) to push out the pressure plate and remains<br>
in compression sealing the joint.<br>
The pressure plate may also have a set of steps distributed over its<br>
perimeter at number of places of the same as the numbers of pins. The<br>
pressure plate can be rotated at its own position through 2 holes placed on<br>
the opposite side of the pressure plate ring.<br>
As the thickness increases with the help of the shear pin the sealing<br>
rings gets further compressed making the joint tighter and consequently<br>
suitable for higher hydraulic pressure in the pipeline.<br><br>
Fig.3 describes the joint in another embodiment where there is a cast skirt (7)<br>
near the opening of the socket (1). Bolts (4 and 4') pass through this skirt and<br>
by tightening the bolts (4 and 4') the pressure plate which will be in parts to<br>
facilitate entry (3) can be moved deeper inside the socket further to make the<br>
rubber gasket (5) seal tighter suitable for higher pressure. In this embodiment<br>
also the need for flanges and follower glands have been eliminated.<br>
The present invention provided the following techniques of improved mechanical<br>
joint assembly:<br>
1) A process for assembling two tubular elements one of which elements has<br>
a spigot end and the other has a socket. The coupling comprising of a set<br>
of withdrawable stainless steel pins capable of being fixed in the holes<br>
provided on the rim of the socket which prevents the circular pressure<br>
plate and wedge shaped compressed rubber gasket to come out of the<br>
annular space between the socket and spigot in the mechanical joint<br>
which is used for jointing using stuffing box principle keeping flexible<br>
property of the joint.<br><br>
2) In an alternative arrangement where there is a skirt attached to the<br>
end of the socket through which a set of stainless steel bolts pass,<br>
which presses the pressure plate which in turn compresses the<br>
wedge shaped rubber gasket in the annular space between the socket<br>
and spigot and seals the joint but retains the flexible property of the<br>
joint.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is by way of an example. It<br>
will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that other modifications<br>
or alterations in the pipe joint are also possible without deviating from<br>
the scope of the intended present invention.<br><br>
