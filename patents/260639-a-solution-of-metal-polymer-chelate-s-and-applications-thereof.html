A SOLUTION OF METAL-POLYMER CHOLATE(S) AND APPLICATIONS<br>
THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a solution of metal-polymer cholate(s) and applications thereof, and more particularly to a metal hybrid polymer solution and applications thereof for a condensation solution, an oxidizing condensation solution and other reacting solutions, and the metal hybrid polymer solution is used for various applications and chemical engineering areas such as catalyses, gas detections, artificial imitated chitosan solutions, artificial imitated glucosamines, disinfectants, biochemical reactions for fermentation, biological proteins and their metabolite purification, metal enzyme biocatalysts, dry activation for protein enzyme, genetic engineering, bacteria preservation systems, cell or bacteria or protein enzyme culture medium, medical treatments, oil products, plants, semiconductors, nano filtration, nano material production, nano inorganic matters, nano ceramics, nano plastics, nano textiles, batteries, liquid crystals, and biochips, so as to remove organic solvent gases and other gases as well as processing liquid solvents.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, a condensation is an important process for chemical engineering, and it is commonly known that a styrene gas can be changed into a polystyrene solid, and a monomer can be changed into a solid polymer, and these changes are made by condensation and polymerization. However, a polymerization sometimes needs an initialization (such as a partial oxidation) to obtain a successful reaction. In early stages, the structure of a condensation catalyst is very complicated, and an initialization (or a partial oxidation) and a condensation<br><br>
are indispensable to each other. Unlike the present oxidation and condensation that can be held at the same time, a stable gas requires an oxidation and a condensation for the reactions, and some gases even require high temperature and pressure for the reactions, and thus the investments, costs, financial resources and material resources are obviously huge. The present invention comes with a very simple structure and also requires a catalyst and a carrier with the function of performing condensations, oxidizing condensations and other reactions to process organic solvent gases and other gases. In early days, there were carriers for absorbing and neutralizing gases, but there was no carrier to deal with a solvent gas directly, and the reacting carriers at early days came with a very short life. However, the physiologically active life of the present hydroxypropylmethyl celluloses (HPMC) and other matters with special functional groups can be extended unlimitedly and developed to be an artificial imitated chitosan solution containing metal ions, so as to provide high-efficiency, high-density, high-activation and long-life biological carriers. The metal hybrid polymer solution is used for gas detections and the solution also becomes a metal enzyme biocatalyst.<br>
The metal hybrid polymer solution can be developed further to provide novel biochemical enzyme systems and enzyme immobilization systems. The immobilization and preservation of bacteria rely on nitrogen gas for the preservation for a long time. The related cultivation and purification are not easy at all and always get contaminated easily, and thus it is necessary to change the carrier after a specific period of time. The concentration of bacteria cannot reach a high level, and thus the potency is very limited. When bacteria are cultivated, the metabolism issue of the nutrition sources is generally taken into consideration, but the chitosan solution or chitosan or humic acid imitated by the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) at a specific combination does not need to<br><br>
consider the metabolism issue of the nutrition sources anymore. The metal hybrid polymer solution is used to replace the conventional culture medium with a powerful cultivation of bacteria, enzymes, nucleic acids and cells and also used to develop biological proteins and purifying its metabolite. In the nano technology, a metal solution usually comes with a size of 10-6m, and will achieve a nanometer (10~9 meter) scale after the solution is dried. The nano scale can be achieved generally by going through a sol-gel method to convert the metal solution into an organic metal, and the chemical process is very complicated. However, the present new enzyme system can provide nano applications for nano filiations, nano ceramics, nano plastics and nano textiles. The process for the waste solvent treatment is the same, and thus a quick room-temperature condensation and oxidizing condensation can be achieved, and the previous infeasible waste solvent treatment is made feasible now.<br>
In view of the shortcomings of the prior art, the inventor of the present invention based on years of experience to conduct extensive researches and experiments, and finally developed a metal hybrid polymer solution and applications thereof, in hope of providing a long needed solution for related problems.<br>
As we know, a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) exists in many plants, and the cellulose in a wood is a natural fiber polymer. In the nature, the physiological activity of the HPMC has functional properties, and the HPMC is nontoxic to human body and free of stimulations or allergic reactions, and thus the HPMC has a very good biocompatibility with human body without producing any antibody. The HPMC used in the chemical engineering area can dissolve heavy metals and different monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions, in addition to its common usage as a connecting agent or an additive. In fact, an appropriate proportion of monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions and amino groups can maximize the reaction of oxidized, degradated,  condensed  and  polymerized<br><br>
organic solvents for some specific chemical gases, and the HPMC can be applied in the areas of biological semiconductors, chips and liquid crystals. We usually think that it is necessary for chitosan to use another medium (such as carbon tetrachloride or sodium sulfate) for the condensation, or the reaction must be taken place for the reactions of producing acidic or alkaline gases only, but we may not know that oxygen cations can be produced continuously by air friction, and an oxidized solution with a precise control on its dosage, after the oxidized solution is dried.<br>
In view of the existing shortcomings of the prior art, the inventor of the present invention based on years of experience and professional knowledge to conduct extensive researches and experiments, and finally invented a metal hybrid polymer solution and applications thereof, in hope of overcoming the foregoing shortcomings.<br>

Compared with the prior art, the present invention obviously has the following advantages and benefits to achieve the objectives of the present invention, and the main technical content of the invention is described as follows:<br>
The invention provides a metal hybrid polymer solution that solves sucrose or maltose or lactose or rechalose or dicarbohydrates or monocarbohydrates;<br>
or degradated oil, or artificial synthesized chitosan, chitosan, seaweed cell wall, cereal of a plant such as unhusked rice or cytokinin-O-glucoside, and related monosaccharide bimolecules;<br>
or polyvinyl alcohol solution together with ammonia (or amine) matter or polyvinyl alcohol;<br><br>
or peat, nitrified humic acid, humic acid solution together with ammonia (or amine) matter without the need of using acid  for dissolution or nitrified humic acid, or humic acid;<br>
or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n functional group solution together with ammonia (or amines);<br>
or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n functional group solution already having amino groups;<br>
or 1-4% of chitosan mixed with 0.1-6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC);<br>
or 1 -4% of artificial synthesized chitosan mixed with 0.1 -6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC);<br>
or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with ammonia (or amine) matter;<br>
or independent hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) (which does not require any amino or ammonia or amine matter, if the HPMC is used as degradation solution);<br>
or the foregoing substance mixed with hydroxyl or amino polymer or/and oil or/and sugar;<br>
with the acid (including -COOH organic and inorganic acids such as carboxyl acid) and water, and then adds acidified or chlorinated or hydroxidated (referring to nitrified sodium humate) or inorganic polymer monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions (that can mix two or more bivalent metal ions), primarily using bivalent metal ions and other ions can assist the heating or the following method is adopted, and the method includes heating and mixing the matters evenly; or mixing the metal ions with smaller ion radius with other metal ions; or partially ferments a small quantity of iron ions first, and then adds the metal ions that are difficult to combine, such that the fermentation continues for the formation; or adjusts the pH<br><br>
value such that the hybrid can be combined with the structure stably.<br>
The foregoing 1-4% of ammonia (or amine) matter is added, and thus it is not necessary to add an amino group (such as chitosan or a mixture of chitosan), and the matter is mixed evenly, or blended at a high speed to form a condensation solution or an oxidizing condensation solution (partially or separately add acidified or chlorinated or hydroxidated (referring to nitrified sodium humate) or inorganic polymer bivalent iron ions having the capability of oxidizing a gas), and blended sufficiently for the combination, so as to achieve the required stability. Such reacting solution can be sprayed in a liquid form directly for process the gas in an airtight space or nano inorganic polymer substantially being a PVA-SI-M hybrid ceramic structure (described in a later section) acts as a catalyst carrier, and adds 0.1-3% of PVP K-30 to the produced condensation solution or oxidizing condensation solution or other reacting solution and serves as a moisture absorbent without affecting the combination of the hybrid reacting solution and the hybrid. Unlike the individual mixed moisture absorption, the moisture absorption of the hybrid can enter into a liquid phase reaction immediately.<br>
Alternatively, no moisture absorbent is used as illustrated below:<br>
If hydroxyl or amino polymer is a mixture of 1-4% of chitosan and 0.1-6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or a mixture of 1-4% of artificial synthesized chitosan and 0.1-6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with a small quantity of ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or an independent hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
then no moisture absorbent will be needed to blend or mix the mixture evenly, and the solution is covered and soaked onto the ceramic structure, and the soaked ceramic is baked and dried to remove any water.    In the relative humidity<br><br>
of over 99% or a dry condition, a ceramic catalyst carrier is produced for providing the capability of removing an organic solvent and other gases, as well as a gas having similar molecular weight or structure of the organic solvent for the volatile organic solvent or petroleum gases that can be condensed and oxidized and condensation. The condensation solution or the oxidizing condensation solution can condense a large quantity of organic solvents and waste solvents by a high-speed blending process at room temperature to condense the organic solvent into a clay solid, so as to develop a solvent processing machine.<br>
The chitosan of the invention refers to chitosan and synthetic chitosan, such as the artificial synthetic products available in the market and made by the extraction from shrimp and crab shells. The major quality index for the raw material of chitosan includes color and luster, water content, dust content, viscosity and solubility, etc, and the quality of the sensitivity of the reaction solution is closely related to the preparation of condensation solution or oxidizing condensation solution. Therefore, the required quality indexes of the raw material of chitosan include 20% of water content, 10% of dust content (or the ratio of thickness to viscosity is 0.5-5.5), and a good solubility. In the condensation or oxidation solution prepared according to this method, the concentration of chitosan is generally 0.1-10%, and the optimized concentration is 1-6%.<br>
A chemical compound having the same chemical conditions and functions as the chitosan includes a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and an amino group, and the metal ion acts as a medium for being a catalyst for the metal ions, such that the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) can be mixed with NH3. If the hydrogen of a R-OH functional group of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is dehydrogenated and dehydrated by the metal such that NH2 can be halfly bridged and combines with the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) to produce R-NH2.    By then, this solution is a polymer hybrid having the same<br><br>
chemical solution, chemical state and chemical molecular structure as those of chitosan, and becomes an artificial imitated chitosan solution containing metal ions. The bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid or partial cell body is developed to a long-life, high-concentration bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid or cell body carrier. The imitated chitosan of the artificial imitated chitosan solution can be used in any area that the chitosan is used. The solution is fermented to produce a metal to a nano scale, and nano metal particles or nano metal oxides or nano complex metal oxides can be obtained by gas phase or liquid phase or combustion or carbonization methods. The imitated chitosan is developed into liquid crystal solution and other aspects for the applications in eight major enzyme systems. The principle for these eight major enzyme systems is similar to the principle described above. Regardless of having hydroxyl or hydroxyl and amino and/or carboxyl and/or carbohydrate polymer or disaccharide or monosaccharide or monosaccharide bimolecule, the imitated chitosan can be combined with the metal salts and then combined with carboxyl and amino groups to produce low to mid polymer metal hybrid polymer. Some enzyme systems use inorganic polymer carrier and/or plant fiber and/or carboxyl resin and amino resin or inorganic matter and/or enzyme system and the principle for the application in biochemical and nano areas.<br>
In view of the description above, the present invention provides a hybrid structured polymer, wherein the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is soaked in an acidic solution with a concentration of 0.1-10%, and in fact this solution is made according to a formula with the composition of water: acetic acid or other acid: hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or other (chemical substance-OH)n polymer: acidified or chlorinated monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions equal to a proportion within 97: 1: 1: 1 and 88: 4: 4: 4, and the composites are added and blended sequentially, and ammonia (or amine matter) is added.    Since it already<br><br>
has an amino group, and thus it is not necessary to add the amino group. A bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body can be added for the fermentation and growth and used for the biochemical area and producing nano and liquid crystal materials.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
To make it easier for our examiner to understand the objective of the invention, its structure, innovative features, and performance, we use a preferred embodiment together with the attached drawings for the detailed description of the invention.<br>
The present invention provides method for producing a polymer hybrid structured solution, and the method comprises the following steps:<br>
1.	Use an acid including 1-10% of acetic acid or other acids (including -COOH<br>
2.	carboxyl organic and inorganic acid) as a solvent for mixing the solution for a<br>
3.	predetermined time at high temperature or room temperature or temperature<br>

8.	cytokinin combined with glucose and capable of promoting the cytokiniesis while<br>
9.	having a physiological action similar to the kinetin) including monosaccharide<br>
10.	bimolecule,<br>
or a polyvinyl alcohol solution together with ammonia (or amine) matter or polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
or a nitrified humic acid or a humic acid solution together with ammonia (or<br><br>
amine) matter, without the need of using acid for dissolution or humic acid,<br>
or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n functional group solution together with ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n functional group solution that already has an amino-NH2 group,<br>
or a mixture of 1~4% of chitosan and 0.1 ~6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or a mixture of 1-4% of artificial synthesized chitosan and 0.1-6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or an independent hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) (it is not necessary to have an amino or ammonia or amine matter, if the HPMC is used as a degradation solution), or the foregoing several liquids are mixed.<br>
3.	Add 1-4% of acidified or chlorinated or hydroxgenated (referring to nitrified<br>
4.	sodium humate) or inorganic polymer monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions<br>
5.	(which can mix two or more kinds of bivalent metal ions); and the bivalent metal<br>
6.	ions are used primarily, and other ions are used to assist the heating, or the<br>
7.	foregoing method is adopted such as heating and mixing the ions evenly; or the<br>
8.	metal ions with a small ion radius must be mixed with other metal ions; or a trace of<br>
9.	iron ion is fermented first, and then the metal ions that are difficult to be combined<br>
10.	are added, so as to continue the fermentation and formation; or the pH value is<br>
11.	adjusted for performing a hybrid combination and stabilizing the structure.<br>
12.	Add the foregoing 1-4% of ammonia (or amine) matter, preferably ammonia<br>
13.	water.   If ammonia water is not available or cannot be used, then ethylenediamine<br>
14.	or other amines can be used instead.    Since there is an amino group already<br>
15.	(such as chitosan or a mixture of chitosan), therefore it is not necessary to add<br><br>
amino groups. The ammonia or amine matter is mixed evenly or blended at a high speed to form:<br>
a.	Condensation solution<br>
b.	Oxidizing condensation solution:<br>
Partially add (iron ions mixed with other kinds of metal ions) or separately add the foregoing 0.1-3% of metal ions or 0.1-100% of acidified, or chlorinated or hydroxidized (referring to nitrified sodium humate) or nitrified or inorganic polymers with bivalent iron ions that has an oxidizing capability for the gas. Manganese ions can be used as well, which constitutes an oxidized condensation solution.<br>
c.	The more the additives in the solution, the more powerful is the oxidizing<br>
capability.   As a result, the solution becomes an oxidizing solution:<br>
An ideal upper limit is 100%, since chitosan carries positive charges and preferably has amino groups, and the complex metal iron ion (and the iron ion and a mixture of other metal ions) can induce a push or a pull in opposite directions to produce negative electrons when carrying out the oxidization, and the oxidation is held at the reacting gas, so as to produce anions for the oxygen gas and also produces oxygen cations.<br>
If the main body is chitosan or humic acid having complex metal iron at an ion state, the produced carrier no longer needs a moisture absorbent or a very dry sensitivity for the applications.<br>
5. Such condensation solution or oxidizing condensation solution or oxidized reaction solution or degradation reaction solution and a content of 0.1-3% PVP K-30 are melted evenly without affecting the moisture absorbent of the reacting solution of cholate(s), or no moisture absorbent is used as follows:<br>
The main body is made by mixing 1-4% of chitosan mixed with 0.1-6% of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or   mixing    1-4%   of   artificial   synthesized    chitosan   with   0.1-6%   of<br><br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
or a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with a trace of ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or an independent hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC).<br>
This solution is sufficiently permeated, soaked, covered by a nano inorganic polymer, substantially a PVA-SI-M hybrid (which will be described in details in a later section) in a ceramic structure, so that the ceramic and reacting solution are combined completely and then baked to dry. The attaching force is enhanced by the viscosity of the PVP K-30, and the moisture absorption and deliquescence of the PVP can absorb the moisture of the carrier easily. If the carrier is blown dry and reacted with the solvent gas, the condensation solution has a very high sensitivity for a liquid-phase (including water) reaction, but the reacting sensitivity at a dry state without water will be very poor,<br>
Since chitosan carries a positive charge, the mixed hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) under the force of metal ions tends to absorb the amino group of chitosan, and gives rise to an ionization of electrons, so that the sensitivity can be improved and no moisture is needed. If the main body is artificial synthesized chitosan or chitosan,<br>
or a polyvinyl alcohol solution mixed with ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or a humic acid solution mixed with ammonia (or amines) matter,<br>
or a functional group solution of other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n mixed with ammonia (or amine) matter,<br>
or a functional group solution of other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n already having-NH2 amino group,<br>
then it will need moisture, or a dehydrogenation and dehydration of metal ions depending on the situation (if it is a -OH functional group) to cope with the -NH2 functional group and the bridge occurs at the polymer metal hybrid (for organic<br><br>
solvent gas), or other gases or liquids at room temperature can give rise to an oxidizing degradation and condensing polymerization, and thus the next step must rely on the deliquescence and high humidity (including water) of the PVP K-30 or air at a dry state for the operation, so that the reaction of the carrier for removing the organic solvent gas will be very smooth and able to last for several months or even one year without being saturated.<br>
6. It is necessary to add bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid or cell body carrier in the fermentation for different applications.<br>
The foregoing functional groups in the solution of the PVA or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n or other polymer (chemical substance-OH)n already having -NH2 amino group, or chitosan, or humic acid, or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) have the following fermentations (The first three are not for sure, or the fermentation requires a carbohydrate to act as an accelerant, and if its (R-OH)nis similar to a carbohydrate structure, the solution will be dissolved by the carboxyl group, and there is an amino group allocated in the metal hybrid structure, and the molecular bond includes asymmetric carbon atoms in a special helix form to assure the occurrence of the fermentation) and the following properties similar to the principle of the hybrid including hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with metal ions and amino compounds and featuring a high-efficiency and enduring stable fermentation. Metal ions are used as a medium for mixing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with NH3, if hydrogen in the R-OH functional group of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is dechlorinated and dehydrated to produce R-M by the metal ions:<br>
a. If the reacting quantity of the metal ions is small and the reacting quantity of the amino groups is relatively large, the hybrid structure will not be tight, so that the ionization of the metal ions is increased greatly, the activity is improved, and the catalytic sensitivity is raised accordingly, and it tends to have the characteristics of<br><br>
an oxidizing condensation.<br>
b.	If the reacting quantity of the metal ions is relatively large, and the reacting<br>
quantity of the amino groups is relatively high, then the hybrid structure will be tight,<br>
and a condensation will be conducted.<br>
c.	If the reacting quantity of the metal ions is too large and the reacting quantity<br>
of the amino groups is relatively large, then a precipitation will occur, and many<br>
metal ions is half-bridged by a-R main body, and R already has amino groups<br>
which can greatly facilitate the ionization of electrons, and an oxidation will be<br>
conducted to form anions at the oxygen gas and produce oxygen cations.<br>
NH2 can be half-bridged with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) to form<br>
R-M-NH2:<br>
a.	If the reacting quantity of the amino groups and the reacting quantity of the<br>
(metal) ions are not too large, then many metal ions are half-bridged with a-R main<br>
body, and connected to an electric hole, for moving the ionized electron to an<br>
opposite direction, and thus a degradation will be conducted to form a PVA hybrid,<br>
and increase the level of polymerization.    It tends to have a gelation, and the<br>
adorability of the structure is increased, and the high temperature carbonization<br>
can be used as an adsorber.<br>
b.	If the reacting quantity of the amino groups and the reacting quantity of the<br>
metal ions are large, thenNH2 shows a bridge (ionization and jumping) on the<br>
metal-polymer hybrid, and by then the sensitivity of condensation is enhanced<br>
significantly, and the reaction can be conducted when it is dried.<br>
c.	If the reacting quantity of the amino group and the reacting quantity of the<br>
metal ions are small, then R-metal-NH2 cannot be connected to form a reaction<br>
mechanism, and both will jump back and forth, and a slow condensation will be<br>
conducted.<br>
d.	If the reacting quantity of the amino groups is large, then the stability of the<br><br>
solubility of bacteria and enzyme will be high, because the bacteria and enzyme are dissolved by nitrogen.<br>
Further, if the reacting quantity of the amino groups is large, the main body R-OH will be dechlorinated and dehydrated by the metal ions to form R-NH2, or the main body already has amino-NH2 groups; if the reacting quantity of metal ions is large, and the main body R-OH will be dechlorinated and dehydrated by the metal ions to constitute a stable polymer metal hybrid. If the number of metal ions is too small, then the hybrid will be unstable. If the number of metal ions is too large, a hybrid precipitate will be produced. Therefore, the number of metal ions and the number of allocated amino groups will form hybrids to push and pull electrons to flow towards the moving catalyst for the reaction of gas or chemical substance. The reaction mechanism caused by the hybrid structure pushes electrons and pulls electrons by electron receivers or donors instead of by hydrogen receivers or donors. The reaction is not a reaction at a neutral state conducted for several times, but it is a reaction at a catalytic state conducted for an unlimited number of times.<br>
Now, the chemical solution and chemical state and chemical molecular structure are the same as those of chitosan which is a polymer hybrid and will become an artificial imitated chitosan solution containing metal ions and then bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body is added. It is not necessary to consider its nitration sources and metabolism issues After being blended and shaken for a period of time (which is determined by the size of the reaction tank, and generally equal to two weeks), the metal ions excite the activity of the enzyme, and a rear end of the NH2 group is connected to a protein enzyme, and an amino polysaccharide such as molassesm with a quick fermentation growth life, a super high concentration, a highly active cell body or bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid solidifies a carrier to produce a biochemical solution having cell body<br><br>
or bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid. If the solution of artificial imitated chitosan has a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with a higher molecular weight, the stability of bacteria or enzyme stability will be high, and the life expectancy will be long, and it will not be saccharified easily. If the molecular weight is low, then the CPS400 will be as follow:<br>
Just like a common chitosan, it will be saccharified easily to turn into glycan, bacteria or enzyme, and the preservation cannot last too long, and its life expectancy is about one year. In general, the life expectancy of a normal pure chitosan solidified enzyme is very short, but the life expectancy will become one year if the metal ions are added, and the life expectancy will be even longer if humic acid is added to the metal ions to cope with the amino groups. However, the imitated solution of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) synthesized under CPS400 is simply like the common chitosan that has a higher compatibility with human body, and primarily uses calcium. If the hybrid is stable, the solution can be used as a gauze for the medical treatment of human body. For the solution synthesized at CPS400 or as described above.<br>
In the CPS75000, the larger the CPS, the higher level is the hybrid polymerization, and the more oleophilic is the CPS75000. It is soluble in water with a disperability and its life is unlimited and forever, so that it can be used in related chitosan of cell body or bacteria or enzyme or nucleic acid used for preserving system, duplicating system, environmental protection, chemical engineering, cosmetics, biochemical, agriculture, fishery, and livestock, and such artificial imitated chitosan solution containing metal ions can be used. If the diversity of the ecological environment of living things including bacteria or enzyme state is taken into consideration, the expiration for those using CPS400 is preferably set to less than a year. If it is used for the fermentation, a chill spray can dry the solution into a solid state for the application and manufacture of<br><br>
chitosan. Another method uses carboxyl resins to substitute acetic acid to dissolve HPMC, so as to achieve the same result as described above.<br>
Further, the compound or polymer in the metal hybrid polymer can use the plant fiber and/or the carboxyl resin including a carboxyl group for the dissolution, and ammonia is added to the bridge compound or polymer of the metal ions for driving the amino solution, and then the carboxyl resin or plant fiber can be performed with a solid-liquid separation and purification to produce an amino metal compound or an amino metal polymer. Such amino matter is at a polarity state and provides various different applications. If the foregoing metal hybrid polymer uses plant fibers and/or carboxyl resins including carboxyl groups as an acid for the dissolution for the fermentation, ammonia or amino resin or inorganic matter such as polylysine or aminosilane will be used as an amino bridge, and a solid-liquid separation is conducted after the fermentation to obtain amino nano metal polymer or amino nano metal compound or nano metal polymer or nano metal compound or amino biological protein or pure biological protein, and their application will be used as described below.<br>
In view of the description above, the hybrid with a larger molecular weight gives a longer stability for the bacteria, and the hybrid with a smaller molecular weight gives a shorter stability for the bacteria, because the hybrid with a larger molecular weight provides electrons a larger space for the ionization of the hybrid. Throwing a ball (electron) with hands and feet comes with a larger force and a smaller frequency. The hybrid with a smaller molecular weight provides electrons a smaller space for the ionization of the hybrid. Throwing a ball (electron) with hands and feet comes with a smaller force and a higher frequency, and each has its merits. Throwing a ball (electron) with hands and feet comes with a larger force, a smaller frequency and a more powerful polymerization. As illustrated by the embodiments, throwing a ball (electron) with hands and feet comes with a<br><br>
larger force, a smaller frequency, and a more powerful capacity of the oxidizing degradation.<br>
From the description above, the anions of the reacting solution produced at each stage of the condensation, oxidized condensation, and oxidation form a film. In the condensation, the electric conductivity is different, and the electric conductivity is small, and the electric resistance is large. In the oxidizing condensation, the electric conductivity is moderate, and the electric resistance is moderate, and if the film formed in the oxidation has friction (clean gas is passed), the electric conductivity of the anion will be large and the electric resistance of the anion will be small (where the normal leather film is non-conducting), and thus we use different reactions at different stages to fit different gases. If the electric resistances at different areas react with the contaminated gases, the reactions at different stages will have fluctuating electric resistance. If it is condensed to a dry adsorption reactant at the air sucking pipe, it has a specific weight and a constant electric resistance, and thus the solvent gas is absorbed when the air pump of the air pipe is started, so as to form suspending colloidal particles fixed on the adsorbent, and the mass of the adsorbed solvent gas is increased at the air pipe including the adsorbent, and the electric resistance of the air pipe will be increased. The larger the concentration of the solvent gas, the larger is the mass of solvent gas to be reacted to form the suspending colloid, and the higher is the electric resistance. The method of increasing the electric resistance to a larger value to compare the increase of mass, and then converting the concentration (for a mid-sized single gas molecule, the complex gas of the same kind uses the total amount of hydrocarbons for the measurement). Similarly, the same applies to the oxidizing condensation (for a mid-size single gas molecule, and the gas has a high stability and free of radicals, the complex gas of the same kind used the total amount of hydrocarbons for the measure, when it is necessary to perform the<br><br>
oxidization before the condensation). If anions are produced in the oxidation and the formed film has friction (clean gas is passed), the electric conductivity of the anion will be large, and the electric resistance will be small. If it is reacted with the contaminated gas, the produced anions will be consumed, and thus the electric conductivity will become small and the electric resistance will become large. From the increased value of the electric resistance, we can know the quantity and concentration of the consumption. The concentration is set to zero if a clean air is passed, we can obtain the concentration by the consumption (For a small-sized single gas molecule, the complex gas of the same kind uses the total number of hydrocarbons for the measurement).<br>
For example, the molecular weights of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) system in Embodiment 5 have different viscosities: CPS75000 and CPS400 and result in a hybrid with a larger molecular weight and a hybrid with a smaller molecular weight as well as a condensation and an oxidizing condensation, wherein the metal salt of copper sulfate is used to increase the electric conductivity. In the same formula, the graph of the relation between the electric resistances of different reactions is plotted, and instruments are used to correct the positive electric resistance and the increase of mass and the concentration of gas, and then a microcomputer is used to compute and display the correct data. Similarly, the anions produced in an oxidation as illustrated in Embodiment 1, if the complex gases of different kinds (referring to the mid-sized solvent gas molecule and the small-sized gas molecules such as SOX and NOX) are tested, the anions produced in the oxidation as illustrated in Embodiment 2 oxidation are used as a probe, because the air friction at its film produces anions for the small-sized gas molecules as well as the mid-sized gas molecules for the oxidizing condensation. The unique graph of the electric resistances can measure the concentration of the total consumption of hydrocarbons in the complex gases of different kinds, and this<br><br>
kind of problems can measure the polymer gas such as the smell of plastics. The polymer gas requires a strong oxidizing degradation for the mid-sized gas molecules and a set of oxidizing condensation is performed to remove and process the graph of the electric resistance of the polymer gas versus the concentration, so that it can be used for detecting the gas concentration. If this system is used together with nano carbon tubes, the electric resistance and sensitivity of the gas can be identified more clearly.<br>
Further, the fermentation at the metal hybrid polymer is developed to produce a biocatalyst for the metal enzyme. Traditional metal enzymes are fermented enzyme compound plus metal ions, and their life expectancy is limited, but the life and activity of the fermented enzyme of the metal hybrid polymer (such as the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) system) can be extended unlimitedly, and it becomes a high-performance, high-level, metal biocatalyst. A specially made metal biocatalyst is added to different reacting solutions according to different reactions, and the catalyst provides a synergy for the processing of gas or chemical substance. This solution can add other precipitating agents, or add an alkali, or add excessive metals such that it can be precipitated, or add adsorbent to promote the precipitation, such that it is converted to a solid metal enzyme biocatalyst.<br>
From the description above, a carboxylic acid including a -COOH group dissolves chitosan or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or the R-NH2 includes an amino group just like the humic acid already having a carboxyl group, so that the whole solution has the amino (alkaline) group as well as the carboxyl (acidic) group, and the so-called positive and negative molecules for driving the catalysis of the whole solution. In the formation of hybrids, the negative molecule and positive molecule are adjacent to each other and gradually developed to tens or hundreds of hybrid tissues, just like the form of protein tissues.   The amino acid<br><br>
also has an amino (alkaline) group and a carboxyl (acidic) group, and they are connected linearly to form circular bond to provide a unique configuration for each protein. Since the hybrid solution and protein tissue provide a very good compatibility for the positive and negative charges and are developed to carries of the protein substances such as cell, bacteria, enzyme, nucleic acid, DNA and RNA. If chitosan (already having an amino group) is bonded with the R-NH2-(metal ions) of the hybrid structure, humic acid, and the (dehydrated-OH radical) of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is bonded with R-metal ions-NH2 of the hybrid structure, and the electrons of the two will move in different directions, and thus causing different catalyses and sensitivities. Further, the proteins are dissolved preferably with an electric potential suitable for each protein.<br>
If the solution has not been dissolved by carboxylic acid, a fatty acid is used as the main body and "R" becomes a micro metal hybrid including amino groups, and thus it is not suitable for the growth of bacteria protein. It has the function of suppressing bacteria and can be developed into a quaternary ammonium salt which is suitable to be used as a disinfectant. For example, the butter goes through a saponification to form the butter with sodium salts. With a trace of metal ions, the amino group becomes a hybrid salt with manyNH2 functional groups. With the strong dragging force ofNH2, a powerful disinfectant is produced, and it can work together with a dilute sulfuric acid as a penetrating agent or a medicinal extract or a solvent for skin treatment, environmental sanitization. This disinfectant including an amino group that attracts bacteria protein easily, but it cannot duplicate the carboxyl group of the bacteria. The disinfectant shows a polarity state for stabilizing the bonding forces of the protein including the hydrogen bond, ionic bond, hydrophobic bond, disulfide bond or Van der Waals force, and the bonding force of the secondary bonds is damaged, such that the protein will be decomposed and denatured, and the bacteria will be killed naturally.<br><br>
Therefore, it is a very good disinfectant.<br>
If the solution of other polymers (chemical substance-OH)n has functional groups or the solution of other polymers (chemical substance-OH)n having functional groups already includes the -NH2 amino group, then the main chemical composition of these solutions has a carbohydrate structure such as chitosan, humic acid, and droxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) that can be fermented, and if the main chemical composition is not a carbohydrate structure, then carbohydrates are added to assist the fermentation. The molecular bond includes asymmetric carbon atoms featuring a special helix structure and a high stability of fermentation stability, and the monosaccharide or disaccharide can be added. The stability becomes very high and the life expectancy becomes very long, after the monosaccharide is added. If PVA already has a trace of acetic acid radicals, some acetic acid is added, and metal salts are added into the water solution, then the solution will be dehydrogenated and dehydrated, and blended at a high speed while the ammonia water is added slowly to form the hybrid. Carbohydrates such as monosaccharide are added and mixed evenly, and then the growth of bacteria or enzyme or tiny nucleic acid or partial cell body can be maintained, and its solidified structure includes: PVA-metal M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar, which is R-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar, and such structure can preserve the bacteria with a long life. Since the PVA does not have asymmetric carbons, it only can maintain the life of bacteria without a good duplicating capability. If there are asymmetric carbons in the aforementioned situation, the life of bacteria can be maintained and a good duplicating capability is provided as well. Further, a polymer unit that is not saturated with fatty acid is taken for example, and an oil is added into the acetic acid, pure water, metal salts, ammonia water, monosaccharide and mixed evenly, and then bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body are added for the growth of fermentation, and its solidified<br><br>
structure includes: fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar, and such structure can maintain a long life for the bacteria. In fact, the hybrid of carboxyl and metal ions of the fatty acid and the hybrid structure produced by the allocated amino groups can solidify and fix the enzyme protein, since this fatty acid includes high-carbon molecular R, and others include organic carboxylic acid. If there is no R that includes more carbons, and thus it cannot produce hybrid at a leading position, and thus the structure of this type of fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar is a reprint of cell tissues.<br>
In a human body, the food source: oils (fatty acids), minerals (metal ions), proteins (amino sources), enzymes in the body, carbohydrates (rice and noodles), acidic matters (organic carboxylic acid such as onion and lemon) are matters that constitute the human body cells, and various stem cells of a human body including nerve stem cells, skin stem cells, embryo stem cells, different stem cells of internal organs. The development of these cells goes with the development of different protein enzymes, and thus the repair of human body cell requires this type of fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar structure. For dietic treatments, it intentionally lacks the matters of this carboxylic acid, to suppress the quick expansion of enzymes in a human body, and the cells in the body will be composed more slowly. By then, the growth of bacteria in the human body can be suppressed. For example, such dietic treatment for a long period of time can control the disease of AIDS and cure by supplying enzymes to the patient's body. The quantity of enzymes in an AIDS patient's body is much greater than the quantity of enzymes, and thus the AIDS disease will disappear from the patient's body during the process of metabolism n body. For example, the cells in a kidney are recovered by detoxification, and the aforementioned dietic treatment method is used for the control. The patient takes the food containing the foregoing acidic matters and enzymes for supplementing the enzymes in the cell body of the kidney.   As a<br><br>
result, the kidney function can be recovered, and this method can be applied for the area of medical science. Taking the growth of a seed for another example, the seed includes fats (fatty acids), proteins (amino sources), starch (carbohydrates), fertilized ovules (nucleic acids) as well as minerals (metal ions) and acidic matters (organic carboxylic acids) from the soil for the germination and growth of the seed. After the seed grows, a tumor in the plant includes an opines matter such as Octopine Family or Nopaiine Family, which are mid carbon (alkyl) carboxylic acid, and are structures constituted of R-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar to drive the cells to continue their division, and these structure even can create cytokinin and auxin that include monosaccharide bimolecule and important chemical substance for growing the plant continuously.<br>
Further, the industrial oil products include OH radical, and the fatty acid of the industrial oil is accomplished by the foregoing fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar structure, wherein M stands for different metal ions, and calcium is the safest element for this purpose, and the protein is fermented to form an emulsified oil that can act as an additive to dissolve gases or fuels. The fermentation of proteins an promote the combustion or decomposition of the oil, and calcium ions in the fermentation is turned into a nano scale, such that if an engine is ignited, the fermentation of proteins and the spontaneous combustion changes the calcium ions into nano calcium, and provides a complete combustion for the oil, enhance the horsepower, and lower the pollution. The nano calcium can decompose waste gases and will not hurt human bodies. For example, this kind of emulsified matters such as the fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar can be added to an lubricating oil to dissolve the lubricating oil as an additive, such that if a cylinder wall requires a coating of nano metals, then the foregoing formula can coat a layer of nano metal on the cylinder wall if the engine is at a high temperature, wherein the fermentation of proteins primarily promotes lubricating or adhering the<br><br>
metal, and the metal ion becomes a nano metal such as aluminum, gold and titanium or a complex metal. Further, waste food oils are used as engine fuels, if the emulsified oil is belong to this type of fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar matter, wherein the enzyme can change the volatility of the waste food oils, so that hydrocarbons are vaporized under the engine compression ratio, and then dissolved with the waste food oils and used as a fuel oil or specific industrial and commercial purpose oil products or specific functioned food oil products can use similar methods. Therefore, the foregoing solution is used extensively in oil products.<br>
For example, a disaccharide such as sucrose having a low molecular weight is added with acetic acid, pure water, metal salts, ammonia water and mixed evenly, and then bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body is added for the fermentation and growth, and the solidified structure includes: sucrose-M-NH2-protein enzyme, and this kind of structure does not need the assistance of carbohydrates, because it already has sucrose, and thus the life of bacteria can be maintained very long. Another protection of the sucrose resides on that the whole dry sugar cane can be cut into small pieces so that they cannot be separated from the bagasse, and the juice of sugar can will not turn rotten because of the protection provided by such dry sugar cane fiber, and then acetic acid, pure water, metal salts, ammonia water are applied and mixed evenly, and the bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body can be fermented and grown, and its solidified structure includes: R-sucrose-M-NH2-protein enzyme, wherein R refers to a dry sugar cane fiber (plant fiber). Assumed that monosaccharide, acetic acid, pure water, metal salt, ammonia water are mixed evenly, a polymer hybrid will not show, but only a single scattered micro molecular hybrid shows, and they cannot be connected into a whole piece, so that the stability and constancy of fermentation is very limited.<br><br>
The fermentation used to achieve the metal in a nano scale is not very effective, since the overall current is not driven. If polymer bridging agent or plant fiber or inorganic polymer carrier (including inorganic and organic bridge inorganic polymer or nano inorganic polymer) imitates the theory of a dry sugar cane fiber, the fermentation and metal nano condition of a small hybrid molecule at the connecting portion can be improved. Therefore, the formula also can be applied to the arrangement of mixing monosaccharide, acetic acid, pure water, metal salts, ammonia water evenly and adding polymer bridging agent or plant fiber or inorganic polymer carrier, and it includes R-monosaccharide-M-NH2-protein enzyme, and the linearity of the polymer bridging agents is better and the joining line is linear to form a bond. If the glucose follows the method of the artificial imitated chitosan can become an artificial imitated glucosamine showing a R-glucose-M-NH2 structure, wherein R refers to dry sugar cane fiber and/or coconut fiber and/or palm fiber (plant fiber and/or including carboxyl acid fiber), M refers to a trace of calcium, and a removal of R changes the structure to a glucose-trace of M-NH2 including trace of calcium glucosamine, to be used for dietic health care, cosmetics and emulsification functions.<br>
The monosaccharide also has another method, and the monosaccharide and single molecules are combined into a bimolecule compound having monosaccharides, and then acetic acid, pure water, metal salt or ammonia water is used and mixed evenly, and then bacteria or enzyme or smaller nucleic acid or partial cell body can be fermented and grown, and its solidified structure shows the features as follows: it includes monosaccharide bimolecule-M-NH2-protein enzyme, and the life of bacteria can be maintained very long, and thus it can be used for achieving a nano metal, and the nutrition source in a plant is light water, minerals of the soil, bits of organic hydrocarbons and ionized ammonia nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the air, and the plant can synthesize sugar including carboxylic acid, and<br><br>
the cytokinins in a plant such as the cytokinin-o-glucosides, and the aforementioned solution together with the specific DNA and RNA of the plant can be used for the photosynthesis of the plant or the electric conduction (substituting the light) can produce a large quantity of specific chemical substance in the plant or non-conducting production (it is necessary to change the DNA carrier and the appropriate reaction mechanism), and different DNAs and RNAs in the plant in different carriers can produce different chemical substances by the photosynthesis. Now, we can control the DNA and RNA of the plant, and the carrier of the plant, and the photosynthesis mechanism and nutrition sources of the plant, so as to produce specific chemical substances of the plant. For example, the production condition of a plant in a fermentation tank controls the light, water, minerals and bits of organic hydrocarbons and ionized ammonia nitrogen, carbon dioxide, DNA and RNA that uses the following cultivation and purification of the biological protein enzyme as a carrier (such as the R-unhusked rice-Nh^-protein enzyme system) to combine and include the monosaccharide bimolecule-M-NH2-protein enzyme system, and it also can cultivate the chemical substances required in a plant.<br>
Further, the fiber containing carboxyl acids or modified fibers containing carboxyl acids or carboxyl resins such as amberlite IRC-50, pure water, cereal of a plant such as unhusked rice , ammonia water are mixed evenly for the fermentation of a polymer hybrid, and the smashed unhusked rice includes a glycan matter and calcium and shows a R-glycan matter-calcium-NH2-protein enzyme, which is a R-unhusked rice-NH2-protein enzyme, and R refers to the smashed fiber including carboxylic acid (plant fiber or carboxyl resin such as amberlite IRC-50), and it is not necessary to add acetic acid for very good stability and constancy of the fermentation. This semi-solid matter is filtered to produce a liquid, which is a protein enzyme having no carrier and will not be contaminated easily,  and thus it does not require any purification to obtain a solution of<br><br>
high-purity high-yield cell or bacteria or enzyme or vaccine. The solution can be used to cultivate and purify various different biological protein enzymes. Further, the R-seaweed cell wall (containing calcium)-NH2-protein enzyme can follow the foregoing method to purify the solution of high-purity high-yield cell or bacteria or enzyme or vaccine, but it is necessary to prepare the disinfection measures first. Further, the combination of R-peat-calcium-NH2-protein enzyme, solid peat and calcium will not be precipitated, and the peat contains a humic acid with the properties of a glycan matter. The humic acid further contains the properties of carboxylic acid, and thus the peat-calcium-NH2-protein enzyme structure may have R (fibers of carboxyl acid or carboxyl resin) to achieve a high-purity high-yield cell or bacteria solution or enzyme or vaccine, but it is necessary to prepare the disinfection measure for the peat first. For R-hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and humic acid and calcium-NH2-protein enzyme, the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and humic acid and calcium are mixed and gone through a pH-balanced precipitation to form a hybrid solid combined with calcium and filtered and mixed with the ammonia for fermentation to form hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and humic acid and calcium-NH2-protein enzyme. Such structure may have R (fibers of carboxyl acid or carboxyl resin) to achieve a high-purity high-yield cell or bacteria solution or enzyme or vaccine. Further, the R-chitosan and calcium-NH2-protein enzyme can follow the foregoing method to purify the solution if high-purity high-yield cell or bacteria or enzyme or vaccine. The required enzyme solution can be filtered from the carrier, and those not used will be put back to the carrier for bridging and preserving the activity of the enzyme solution. Particularly, some vaccine or enzyme cultivation used for human bodies and animals does not require a carrier system accompanied to enter into a human body, and this kind of purifications is the most appropriate one because   it  is   much   simpler  and   easier  than   the  technologies   of  affinity<br><br>
chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography (HPLC). If the fermented and purified matter does not need any remaining amino groups, the suspension and cultivation of amino resin or inorganic matter such as polylysine or aminosilane can substitute ammonia for the fermentation, and then the purification is a typical application of the metal hybrid polymer solution for the cultivation and purification of biological cell or bacteria or protein enzyme.<br>
Similarly, the foregoing technology of carriers having biological cell or bacteria or protein can be used for the cultivation and purification of non-protein such as bacteria metabolite and products, and the cultivation of general bacteria metabolite and product is to add a nutrient agent into the bacteria solution, so that the life cycle of the bacteria includes metabolism and growth, and the life cycle, growth, progress, and cultivation method and medium are designed according to the required metabolite. The quantity of carrier systems in accordance with the foregoing technology is the major factor for controlling the metabolism and growth of the bacteria. Different metabolism requirements fit different carrier systems, and the number of carriers can control the growth rate of bacteria and the required nutrition for the metabolism and the metabolic product. For instance, the more the carrier, the faster is the bacteria racing for the nutritients, and the slower is the metabolic rate. By then, it is appropriate for the antibiotics in the bacteria to be cultivated. The less the carrier, the more is the productions, and the more is the nutritient. The metabolic growth will become stable, and the yield will be stable. The half cycle achieved by the carrier system in accordance with the foregoing technology is very long, and is almost unlimited. It is one kind of biological reactors capable of continuously performing the biotransformation by a mobile blending reactor or a fixed-bed reactor or a moving bed reactor or super filtering film separating reactor, and the metabolite can be filtered and separated easily, and the purified metabolite can be removed by the bacteria in the body by<br><br>
microfiltration or disinfection or other method. Another kind of biological reactors is a fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar in a semi-solid gel (a filtered solution including carboxylic acid) mixed with a R (a fiber having carboxylic acid or carboxyl resin) can imitate the tissue of human body or animal cell, which is condensed and bridged like internal organs and fixed in the included layers. By then, the slow loop refers to the nutrition solution, and a specific metabolite is cultivated, and then the cultivation is specified. The description above shows a metal hybrid polymer solution used for the cultivation and purification of the biological cell or bacteria or protein enzyme and their metabolites.<br>
Further, the disaccharide, acetic acid, pure water, metal salts, and ammonia water are mixed evenly to give the stability constancy of the fermentation of a polymer hybrid. The invention can be used to obtain a metal in a nano scale. The maltose having no asymmetric carbons is arranged symmetrically in zigzag shaped units due to the short -OH bonds, and these zigzag shaped units are arranged alternately into an object similar to a filtration cloth for providing a more powerful tension for the solution, and the pores on its warps and wefts allow nano components to pass through and the liquid soaked into the film of the cloth is dried to produce a nano filtration cloth. These zigzag shaped units are suitable for objects with a smaller atomic radius. Since the space defined by the hybrid is very small, therefore an object with a larger atomic radius cannot pass through, and even bacteria cannot pass through. Other polymer metal hybrids can be filtered but the filtration will be irregular and will not have lines similar to a woven cloth.<br>
In this series of applications for the fermentation for genetic engineering, the DNA and RNA can be duplicated quickly. Unlike the prior art that requires complicated procedures for cultivating DNA and RNA, the foregoing eight major enzyme systems have different interfaces, so that when two different cultivating<br><br>
interfaces are adjacent to each other, variations will occur during the process of duplicating DNA and RNA. From these variation, we can learn the adaptability of DNA and RNA at different cultivation tissues, and the DNA and RNA in human body fit the cell tissue of human body, and those of animals fit animals, and those for plants fit plants, and those for species fit species correspondingly. Therefore, the invention can be used for duplicating DNA and RNA, studying variations, and developing special gene-cell tissues. For example, if a cell of the epidermis of a human body is bitten by a bug, then new protein enzyme is injected to show a swelling. The SARS proteins and fruit foxes can coexist, but the varied proteins will behave irregularly in the carrier of the cells in human body cell and the adaptability does not exist anymore. In other words, we are sure that the variation of the gene-cell performance shows us that the fruit fox and the carrier of the cells of human body are different. For example, the bird flu will be varied to infect a human body, and a long-term cell carrier is incompatible to a 45-day growth hormone, and thus the size and stability of the enzyme and the adaptability of the carrier of cells are related to the performance of the genes. Therefore, special applications for gene-cell tissues can be developed.<br>
Chitosan exists in nature, and exists in human body just like a cell repairing the tissue of a human body, such as glucose or glycan-protein exist in the tissue of a human body. The imitating chitosan solution of metal ions can also imitate the tissue of a human body to develop the cultivation of cells and reproduction of nucleic acid and DNA, e.g. the humic acid, when the metal ions (inorganic salts) is used together with an amino group, the plant added to the amino group will grow faster and stronger than that without adding the amino. For example, when an injured dog with an exposed bone on its thigh has applied chitosan and a trace of metal elements, its effect will be much better that using the separate chitosan alone. Soon after, the dog's skin and muscle will grow; for example, in the<br><br>
cultivation system of the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), there will be no problem to cultivate single-cell blue-green algae or yeasts by using the fermented grown bacteria and enzyme solution, breaking the insect egg and putting it into the solution. More nano DNAs and RNAs are reproduced and cultivated at the top surface to form the helix shape, which is different from the original bacteria and enzyme. Evidently, such kind of solution can be developed in a variety of proteins. As for the cell tissues, they are featured with a variety of proteins and used to develop diversified tissue cultivation technologies.<br>
The abovementioned series of fermentation solution is compared with the culture medium of the tissues of an invertebrate, much faster and capable of establishing a pure family of cell clusters. In such a solution, partial metal ions can be mixed with different inorganic salts (added respectively), depending on the cultivation requirements. After reproducing the cell, plants are transplanted in the culture medium for roots growing, while animals are transferred to the culture medium for growing. The cultivated cell solution can be mixed with the nutritious solution, and then the cell tissue will continue its development on it. For chicken feeding as an example, using the feed developed by the structure of the fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar with an addition of enzyme accelerant, chicken can be grown up rapidly within 45 days without any side effect. Therefore, we can use it to develop the rapid culture of animals and plants and the sexless reproduction technology.<br>
In the nano technology, usually it remains 10-6 nano after a metal solution is dried. To achieve a nano scale of 10-9m, a sol-gel method for transforming the solution to an organic metal first. The chemical process is difficult and confiscated as well. However, nowadays the protein enzyme is almost of the nano scale, and in the aforesaid enzyme system or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) enzyme system, the internal R-metal ions-NH2-protein enzyme is at an<br><br>
interactive state. Since the protein enzyme will be fermented into the metal hybrid system to form an organic metal and in the solution the positive attraction force and an opposite attraction force will be mutually attracted, and it will lead to a miniaturization of metal ions and a nano scale. Using this technology, different kinds of metal ions can be nanonized for a variety of applications in different fields. In principle, a protein enzyme with a nano scale can have more nano metals and vice versa. If the nano quantity is smaller, its nucleic acid will be even smaller. The quantity of nano metal can be set. Some different protein enzymes have different metal crystal-phases. Those protein enzymes eating up heavy metals can even create a special crystal-phase structure. Hybrid with a higher molecular weight and that with a lower molecular weight will get different crystal-phase structure based on the same bacteria fermentation. For obtaining high yield of nano metal, metal ions with highest rate approximately equal to 10% can be added into the enzyme system or add 10% fermentation first then ass some metal ions, however, the fermentation should be carried out during mixing procedure to avoid any precipitation. For obtaining smaller nano quantity, the metal ions specified in the hybrids table should be dosed. In the reacting solution forming hybrid, if the metal ions are impossible to be combined, it can be heated and mixed evenly; or for metal ions with smaller ion radius, they should be added and mixed with other metal ions; or after half fermentation of a trace of iron ion, add the metal ions which are difficult to be combined, for the purpose of continuation of fermentation and forming. Later, to obtain the nano iron. For obtaining metal, using the magnet to separate the iron for purification; or adjust the pH value to get the hybrid combined, structure tends to be stable etc. method.<br>
The nano metal protein is coated or sprayed onto the enzyme cloth for a dry thermal decomposition or a flame spray is performed for killing protein enzymes at a high temperature, or being partially combusted into a nano film or sintered<br><br>
without oxygen carbonization to remove the organic matter to form a metal carbonate or oxide;<br>
or in the water solution to add thermal decomposition, then add precipitating agent;<br>
or in vacuum state the liquid get vaporized to decompose the compound metal gas, then recycle by condensation;<br>
or to be added in an oil pot for thermal decomposition first, then add water for cooling, precipitation and recycling;<br>
or in the liquid using the oxidizer, O-2 strong oxygen degradation hydrocarbon and amino to get the CO2, H2O, N2 gases blown away.<br>
Finally, only the nano metal particle or nano metal oxide or nano complex metal oxide will be remained (for obtaining the complex metal, when adding the fermentation solution, the complex metal should be independently mixed evenly first prior to addition) for further application or the following purposes. Because the nano metal particles can remove the chemical substances, such as the dechlorination function; Nano oxide powder is featured with higher surface area and higher distribution of porous volumes and therefore, has excellent adhesion ability to solvent. The titanium catalyst solution is a practical case study. When the titanium sulfate and the acid dissolved hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) together with the amino have made a catalyst solution, after fermentation the titanium ion can be nanonized, after coating the Ti compound in the hybrid after half combustion tends to Ti oxide, and become titanium dioxide powder film.<br>
Metal hybrid polymer solution to be added with silicic acid first to become the PVA-silicic acid-metal M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar, it is the R-silicic acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar. The -OH radical of the Rand silicic add and the metal M together with hybrid, after fermentation, the metal will get nanonized. The silicone (Si) can also be nanonized, and can be extended to become a nitrified<br><br>
silicone, carbonization silicone, siliconized complex metal nanonization, using nano material production heat treatment or during the ceramic firing reaction process to add nitrogen or shortage of oxygen or add other nano metal hybrid polymer solution to yield the nano silicone compound or to be mixed directly into the ceramic processing technology to produce the nano complex ceramic material. Additionally, for example, the metal hybrid polymer solution after fermentation, the metal can be nanonized; or in the ceramic process the fermentation metal hybrid polymer solution to be added directly, and in the firing process to get the desired nano complex ceramic material, one can see the kind of nano powder is mixed evenly in there or the intention to obtain the pure nano powder to form nano ceramic. Then, it is heated or ore-sintered and is mixed evenly or oxygen gas is added in the reaction, and then the nano- oxidized metal can be obtained. Alternatively, nitrogen gas can be added similar to the way of mixing it in nano nitrified metal. By adding the fluoric acid, we can obtain the nano fluride metal. By obtaining phosphoric acid, we can obtain the nano phosphoric acidic metal. Based on these methods, one can separate and precipitate or generate crystals or mix the crystals into a ceramic craft to produce a nano complex ceramic material, and nano complex ceramic materials can be made by using the fermentation metal hybrid polymer solution (that can be mixed in many types). In the course of dispersion, the matireal has already possessed moisturized powder. After mechanical dispersion and stabilization, the mixing can be conducted by means of a colloid grinding machine. Amongst these, the fermentation chitosan or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or polyvinyl alcohol nano system can have the characteristic of a cohesive agent, so that the dispersed mixture can be more stable to avoid a reunion phenomenon. It also can control the quality of the turbid solution, so that the base structure even can enter into a forming (a press forming or a casting forming) and ore-sintering or simultaneous proceeding of forming and<br><br>
ore-sintering. During ore-sintering, the wrapped and moist solution of metal hybrid polymer will form be carbonized just like the way in a carbon black wrapping combustion and a heat treatment, and the carbon black will be oxidized. The most important factors are the control of pressure and temperature in the ore-sintering process. The ore-sintering process is separated into a reaction ore-sintering, an atmosphere ore-sintering, a heat pressure ore-sintering, a discharged plasma ore-sintering, an ultra high pressure ore-sintering, a heat static pressure ore-sintering, a high pressure ore-sintering and a high pressure gas phase reaction ore-sintering etc. What kind of nano structures and products is required for the above ore-sintering method? In the most important course, we do not have reunion and crystal growth to obtain a high-quality nano ceramic. For example, in a titanium oxide metal hybrid polymer solution (fermentation hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) system), the reaction is taken place at a temperature of 50m and a humidity of 60%, and then a titanium oxide gel is obtained. After pouring and forming on the gel, a biscuit of titanium oxide can be obtained. The biscuit obtained will have ore-sintering when it is closed to the temperature change for anatase phase and rutile phase. In other words, with the conditions at a temperature under 600£ and a density of 99%, the size of nano ceramic crystal grains is only 60nm. Under general conditions, the density temperature of nano is between 800-1000£. By dense ore-sintering under 600£, it will sufficiently utilize the function of metal hybrid polymer solution during a phase change of nano. Although the temperature of 600 is comparatively low, yet the energy generated from the phase change can promote the proceeding of ore-sintering and still provide us with dense nano ceramic.<br>
The nano metal hybrid polymer solution or multiple type of nano metal hybrid polymer solution (already under fermentation ) will spread evenly to plastic or rubber polymer, polyamide, polyethylene, polystyrene, epoxy resin, and silicone,<br><br>
etc. as the basic material or series of mixed base materials, and the dispersal method is elaborated as follows:<br>
Nano metal hybrid polymer solution itself is assembled liquid and solution plastic or powder form plastic or melted plastic or polymer vanguard small molecular solution evenly mixed including mechanical dispersion, ultrasonic dispersion, high energy processing method and chemical dispersion.<br>
Mechanical dispersion: plastic membrane dispersion, high speed mixing and based on the aiding chemical function to heat and vaporize, so as to enable a separation of metal hybrid and to combine plastic polymers.<br>
Ultrasonic dispersion: supersonic waves will damage the enzyme and hybrid structure of the nano metal hybrid polymer solution, so that the nano metal is comprised of particles that will combine with plastic polymers sufficiently.<br>
High energy processing method: by mixing in colloid or monomer dispersion and through the radiation chemistry function including corona, microwave, plasma, ultraviolet ray etc. (some can promote fermentation) and through heating and vaporization, the metal hybrid will be combined with plastic polymer to combine or simultaneously condense the assembly.<br>
Chemical dispersion: Surface chemistry modifier or compatibilizer or breaker such as hydrochlorous acid solution is added, and then mixed into the nano metal hybrid polymer solution and plastic polymers, so that the metal hybrid can separate and combine with plastic polymers.<br>
Another method is to base on monomer mixing of nano metal hybrid polymer solution and plastic polymer, then use additional polymerization or condensed polymerization or combination solidification and will heat and vaporize to have a mixed forming.<br>
Another method is based on various single mixture and plastic polymer (or carboxyl resin such as Amberlite IRC-50) before the end fermentation or its<br><br>
monomer mixing combination. Then use fermentation and the above feasible dispersal (fermentation will not be interfered with) or in the fermentation add polymerization or condensed polymerization or cross united solidification (referring to fermentation with no interference and will heat and evaporate so that it can become a mixed forming.<br>
In another method of nano metal hybrid polymer solution and polymer latex solution mixing such as dispersal of latex grain of latex. Then add in the flocculatin agent to disperse so that the entire system can be sedimented, centrifugal separation or water dehydration, heat dry and vaporize.<br>
However, all these will consider the stability design of the nano complex material and base on the chemical structure of polymer and the surface electric charge of nano particle of broken belt and incomplete key, there will be formation of common value chain between the two and will be achieved based on ionic bond, position key or parents and function.<br>
For selective system there is chitosan or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or bicarbohydrates or monocarbohydrates, or degradated oils or polyvinyl alcohol or humic acid or mixed or other etc. nano metal hybrid polymer system solution to promote reaction. Especially in some plastic add some fatty acid-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar and this system can cope with other system so as to promote blending.<br>
When metal hybrid polymer has carboxyl, and on top of R-NH2 including amino, such entire solution will possess amino (alkaline) as well as carboxyl (acid base) and clay mixed to obtain organic clay similar to amino acid. At this time, fermentation is feasible and then it combines with plastic and rubber polymer with a multiple compatibility.<br>
The above dispersal meted can be separated or combined for mixed uses. The overheating  evaporation  or other heat melting  press  forming  requires  heat<br><br>
vaporization so that the metal hybrid will collapse and combine with plastic polymer. The forming methods can be separated into pressing forming, solidification forming, extraction forming, injection molding forming and injection forming etc. The above dispersal method can also be used in nano material production. The foregoing process requires adding oxygen gas in a heat reaction to obtain nano oxidized metal or to obtain nano carbonization silicone by oxygen deficiency or adding nitrogen gas in the reaction just like mixing it in nano nitrified metal. The addition of fluoric acid can give nano fluoric metals. The addition of phosphoric acid can give nano phosphate metals. These can be directly mixed in the plastic polymer.<br>
For example, the nano metal hybrid polymer solution in the humic acid-metal zinc-NH2-protein enzyme is used for the manufacture of nano complex rubber in the complex rubber, and a mechanical filling dispersal method is adopted. For rubber bases, the humic acid-zinc-NH2-protein enzyme will exist in the form of separated and assembled body and it will have a cross unity enhancement function. For the humic acid-zinc-NH2-protein enzyme of the nano class assembled enhancement rubber, there are a few characteristics: there is certain compatibility with rubber and there is suitable reaction activity with rubber. There is certain self assembly ability. The even assembly matter of the separated assembly body has a better inner assembly ability. The induction of rubber is to enhance the cross unity efficiency (including cross unity speed and cross unity density). To improve the structure of the cross unity key (induce more ion cross unity key), it will generate joining and cross unity with large rubber molecules and then it will be heated and vaporized in the mixing and blending. The humic acid will be completed in the reaction to produce carbonization. Therefore, the temperature will progressively enter into a high temperature from a low temperature. The low temperature is to bring out its reaction and the high temperature will end soon, so that the carbonization will disappear.   What remains<br><br>
is a combination of nano zinc or zinc oxide. For the mechanical function of the nano zinc filling rubber, the contractability for pulling is higher. In the nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) in that form, 10% of nano zinc is filled, and the contractability of its vulcanized rubber can reach up to 55Mpa, which is the maximum rubber intensity except for the short fiber complex rubber.<br>
In the metal hybrid polymer solution in the application of nano textile industry, nano fiber is added into the nano metal hybrid polymer solution (particles) mixed yarn manufacture and coating processing and there is a metal hybrid polymer solution used in textile product in the industry to extend the technology to conduct dye-transfer processing.<br>
Palletization method: It is produced as a material slice in the course of assembly, after the metal hybrid polymer solution is added.<br>
Condensed assembly- palletization slice cutting-dry-lever yarn-processing after rolling-polyster fiber.<br>
Injection method: In the yarn processing course, a syringe is used to add the solution of metal hybrid polymer in the melted polyster fiber to make polyester fibers. The method is to place the solution of the metal hybrid polymer (dry) into the syringe and then pour it in the solution while the lever is spinning. Polyester slice cutting-dry-lever spinning-processing after rolling-polyester fiber.<br>
Solution polyster fiber: Most of the base materials used by the solution spinning are polypropylene. Normally the metal hybrid polymer solution is added directly into the polyester fiber solution and mixed with the melted spinning. Also, the ceramic inorganic salt can be dispersed to the metal hybrid polymer solution of the chitosan or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) system and then a further fermentation is conducted and it is added into the spinning solution.<br>
Implant processing method: In the surface micro pore size and shape of the natural fiber and based on different fibers, the pore diameter of most of these micro<br><br>
pores is comparatively larger than the diameter of inorganic nano grains. On the warp surface, the processed fiber will combine with inorganic nano. The activity of the metal hybrid polymer solution and natural fiber will activate physical adsordability and chemical combination.<br>
Coating method: The metal hybrid polymer solution will be evenly coated on the top of the natural fiber to form a layer of thick coating membrane. After drying and necessary heat treatments, various mechanical natural fiber processing can be conducted.<br>
The aforementioned metal hybrid polymer solution is characterized in that the metal hybrid polymer solution used in the nano plastic or nano textile industry includes plastic or rubber polymers, wherein the plastic or rubber polymer is polyamide, polyimide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyaniline, polystyrene, polyphenylenevinylene, acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene, polyethylene oxide, epoxy resin, bakelite, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyacrylic ester, polyester, polyurethane, polyolefin, polyvinyl butyral, polysiloxanes, pinene oxide (PNO), rubber, nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), silicone, polyvinylpyrrolidone or its precursor or its oligomer or the foregoing modification and blend system.<br>
Dye-transfer Process: The metal hybrid polymer solution of a monosaccharide system is an R-monosaccharide-M-NH2-protein enzyme, wherein R refers to a plant fiber or an inorganic polymer carrier (including inorganic and organic bridge polymer or nano inorganic polymer) formed to a nano scale after the fermentation is completed. If R (referring to a plant fiber or a carrier including carboxyl acid fiber or inorganic polymer) disappears, it is a monosaccharide-M-NH2-protein enzyme, and then the life of protein enzyme is not very long and the protein enzyme is less stable. After a brief baking and disinfection, the monosaccharide-M-NH2 is removed. By then, a metal M is in a nano scale and it includes an amino R, and the nano metal matter, is in a polarity state and similar to<br><br>
an azo dye developer R-NH2 that matches up with an azo dye base for an azo coupling, so as to secure the nano metal matter on the fibers without causing any harm to human body. For example, the metal hybrid polymer solution for a monosaccharide system is placed in a (bridgeable) carrier filled with plant fibers. After fermentation is completed, the metal is turned into a nano scale, and the metal hybrid polymer solution is squeezed from the plant fibers under pressure, and the squeezed metal hybrid polymer solution is baked at 80. c and disinfected by ultraviolet beams, and a dye-transfer process is carried out to the nano metal to coat a base in the dye-transfer process and dissolve the base in the water, such that the fibers are soaked into the base, and then the developer R-NH2 is mixed with the nano monosaccharide-M-NH2 for the nitrification to achieve the functional effect of a nano metal and show the color. These are the applications of the metal hybrid polymer solution in the nano textile industry.<br>
The foregoing reacting solution is a novel polymer liquid crystal material, and such biological liquid crystal features the mobility of the liquid and the sequence similar to a crystal structure. People discovered that many biological macromolecules such as RNAs, DNAs, proteins, fats, fat protein and polysaccharides have the properties of a liquid crystal, since they are made of a single helix structure and a double helix structure. This fermentation series such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is a double helix structure formed by the fermentation (the hybrid structure not fermented is a single helix structure or this water soluble single helix structure can be used as a liquid crystal. After a nucleic acid is added and fermented, the added protein enzyme becomes a double helix structure) which is stabler than the single helix structure in the solvent. The double helix structure can exist stably without the solvent, and thus it can be developed more extensively. This solution copes with the fermentation by silver sulfate to make a nano silver and obtain a high light transmission rate in the visible<br><br>
light area and a nano liquid crystal solution with a smaller resistance, or becomes a film after being dried. This nano liquid crystal and liquid crystal film electrode can be used in flat panel displays.<br>
The foregoing reacting solution is a novel semiconductor material that can fix a natural electronic component made of proteins or celluloses such as DNA of a plant at a monosaccharide enzyme system including a monosaccharide bimolecule-M-NH2-protein enzyme, a monosaccharide-M-NH2-protein enzyme-polymer bridging agent and uses the characteristic of a plant conducting photosynthesis to develop an organic electroluminescence (OL), and these two major enzyme systems are not fixed so securely, and the activity of enzymes can be strengthened by external forces, and thus it requires plants to receive lights and produce electrons inside for the growth. If no direct light is given for the reaction of the electrons, the reaction will be controlled by the surrounding growing conditions, so as to produce a reverse reaction to emit a light source, or the gene and enzyme of a luminous body of a firefly or an animal in water are used for the development. These are organic EL semiconductor components. Further, the protein chips use the protein molecules of the biological material such as the protein enzyme system of polyvinyl alcohol and goes through a special art to prepare a layered structure of super film tissues. For example, the proteins are used to prepare a liquid of an appropriate concentration, so that the water surface is spread into a single molecular layer film which is then placed on a quartz layer. Similarly, a layer of organic film is prepared to obtain a biofilm with a thickness of several hundreds of nanometers. This kind of films is composed of two types of organic matter films. If ultraviolet rays are projected onto the protein enzyme system of a polyvinyl alcohol of one type of films, the resistance will rise approximately by 42%; and if visible lights are projected, then the resistance will resume its original status.    However, the protein enzyme system of a humic acid<br><br>
of another type of films will not be affected by the visible lights, and if ultraviolet rays are projected, the resistance will be decreased approximately by 7%. The different protein enzyme systems of the two different solutions of metal hybrid polymer are combined to produce a biological material which becomes a novel light controllable switch component. This type of films can be used for developing bioelectronic components and creates the applications for semiconductors.<br>
The foregoing reacting solution is a novel biofuel battery material that can use specific gene and/or enzyme to receive lights or other stimulations, and the electron reaction produced inside constantly conducts electrons to accumulate electrons and cause an electromotive force, so as to produce a current, or the enzyme of an electric generating system in the body of an electric eel is used to develop the generation of electricity. For example, the seeds of alfalfa sprout in a plant are originally at a sleeping state, and the alfalfa sprout will be germinated if radiations such as ultraviolet rays are provided. Similarly, the genes and enzymes of the germinating alfalfa sprout are extracted and used for the oxidation of the chitosan-NH2-M-protein enzyme to produce anions, such that it can be dried and coated onto the electrode panel after its fermentation. Once if the electrode is coated with sufficient paints capable of emitting ultraviolet rays, another side of the electrode panel adopts a PVA-metal M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar system (as a conductive medium film), wherein the metal uses Ru(2) as a sensitizer, and then the electrolyte includes 0.04mol/L of l2 and 0.5mol/L of Lil and the other end of the electrolyte is a Pt electrode. If the paint emits ultraviolet Uv to excite the gene and/or enzyme of the alfalfa sprout on a chitosan system having an oxidation occurred on the anion system, the energy level of the gene and/or enzyme of the alfalfa sprout will be raised, and the germinating state gives rise to a synthesis having the effect of an electric hole, such that the energy released by the oxidation of the chitosan system discharges anions (electron e), and the energy level h gives<br><br>
rise to an oxidation and a reduction at the electrolyte of the sensitizer of the PVA system and the Pt electrode. Further, the electrons on a nano crystal of the semiconductor electrode film having the oxidation are collected to the electrode surface and transmitted to the opposite electrode through external circuits.<br>
A novel automatic fermentation method for carrier materials and the natural inorganic carrier of a honeycomb hole can produce many tiny bacteria and living organisms, since the inorganic matter has numerous minerals and decayed ionization media, and the novel carrier materials are prepared based on the foregoing theory to form a carrier having an inorganic metal hybrid polymer and bacteria, and its major advantage is its waterproof function. For example, 7kg of PVA powder is added to water and dissolved into an aqueous solution, and then 15kg of silicic acid solution, 6kg of metal salts are added and mixed evenly, and then dipped into the carrier material, such that the carrier material can be dried slowly and sintered into a ceramic form. By then, the structure is a PVA-SI-M metal, and then chitosan solution including carboxylic acid is added to the ceramic carrier material, and a trace of bacteria is added into the chitosan solution and combined slowly with each other to form a PVA-SI-M-chitosan, and the bacteria will be fermented automatically and slowly on the whole carrier to form a PVA-SI-M-chitosan-protein enzyme. By then, the carrier of inorganic metal-polymer hybrid including bacteria has an inorganic system that can be used for related inorganic and organic applications. The PVA is added with silicic acid, and the -OH groups of the two are dehydrated to form a PVA-SI-M-NH2-protein enzyme-sugar connecting structure. If the protein enzyme uses a protein enzyme for decomposing sugar and the alcohol to kill bacteria, a volatile solution is formed or heated, dried and disinfected to form a nano inorganic polymer film showing a PVA-SI-M, wherein silicon will not be precipitated from the reaction, and SI and M are both in a nano scale, and the PVA can use other R (polymer) including -OH<br><br>
coating layer and show a hybrid porous structure that has good adsorptability and it is a very good nano inorganic carrier and can be used as nano paint, nano particles entering this carrier or paint, and it is also a very good reacting structure. Through the metal hybrid, the fermented silicic acid becomes a very good inorganic medium. The nano inorganic polymer film, hole carrier, and sphere developed by the nano metal hybrid polymer solution (fermented) is more functional than those not in a nano scale. In general, PVA-SI-Ca is used to obtain a good stability and functionally a PVA-SI-other metal is preferred and used. This is one of the applications of the metal hybrid polymer solution used for nano inorganic matters.<br>
In a method of using a dry protein enzyme to improve the activity, general bacteria and enzymes are in the state of an aqueous solution or solution to be active for good reactions and functions, but dry bacteria and enzymes die or sleep easily, or their activity declines, so that they cannot have good performance on the reactions and functions. Bacteria and enzymes in aqueous solution or solution can give excellent activity and function, beaus the water medium is a carrier of the survival of bacteria and enzymes, and the conducting ions in water constitute a buffer pool for the activity of reacting electrons of the bacteria and enzymes. Therefore, the bacteria and enzymes in solution are vital. At present, there is a dry system of bacteria and enzyme that can provide excellent vitality. If the foregoing series of reacting solution has an oxidized condensation, and its reacting structure is R-M-NH2, wherein there is a trace of metal (M), and in the bridge protein enzyme and its R-a trace of M-NH2-protein enzyme structure is an unstable hybrid structure (due to) the trace of M, and gives rise to a (shift) jump of each NH2-protein enzyme at the metal M. Although, it is a dry structure, the metal shifts and jumps in the whole hybrid in such a way similar to the shifting of the conducting ions.    Just like in the water, the dry structure shows a good activity for<br><br>
the reactions and functions. For example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) is dissolved in vitamin C, and a trace of metal salts together with a normal amount of amino groups plus protein enzyme are added, the activity and function of the dry protein enzyme become very well, so as to greatly extend the applicability of the protein enzymes from simply working for liquid phase reactions to gas phase and solid phase reactions as well. The foregoing Vitamin C and iron ions play the role of a series of electron streams for the reduction and oxidation. If there is too much Vitamin C, then the bivalent iron ions cannot be oxidized to change their valence, but tend to be condensed because Vitamin C has a strong resistance to the oxidation. If there is too little Vitamin, then the bivalent iron ions will change their valence and will not be reduced, so that the oxidizing power is weakened. Therefore, the two are correlated to the whole hybrid.<br>
A metal hybrid polymer solution is used in biochips, and the foregoing solution comes with the properties of a protein, and the protein and the inorganic polymer carriers are combined with the surface of (inorganic and organic bridge inorganic polymer or nano inorganic polymer) or polymer bridging agent, while maintaining the physical properties of the protein and the biological activity. Through the protein chip technology, we can effectively obtain a huge quantity of protein information in living organisms, and it is an important measure for studying proteins. Like gene chips and protein chips, the method for fabricating these chips in the metal hybrid polymer solution, the probe for printing/ink-jet printing of the solution and micro-manufacturing technology used in the microelectronic industry such as micro-printing, piezoelectric printing (same as the ink-jet printer), optical mask lithography, reacting ion etching, micro molding casting and polymerized film casting method can be used for the manufacture of base materials for the nano inorganic polymer carriers and the applications of separating biological samples or reacting with a microstructure having micron dimensions.<br><br>
For instance, a nano inorganic polymer carrier is coated with a layer of plastic insulating film, for controlling a very narrow focus X-ray beam or electron beam by an electronic computer, and drawing parallel lines on the plastic insulating film, and the width of the lines is equal to tens of nanometers, and the distance between two lines is equal to 200-250nm. Ethanol is used to dissolve a portion of plastic where the light beam is projected and etch several crevices for exposing the nano inorganic polymer. Now, the monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA (already fermented from the plant fibers) is "grafted", and then the position where the plastic insulating film and monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA are attached is washed. We also can set the M on the monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA as a transmitting pulse for the metal (such as silver) if needed. It is a biological integrated circuit, and the amino resin or inorganic matter such as polylysine or aminosilane is a fermented metal hybrid polymer solution. With the solid-liquid separation of the solution (since there is no amino enzyme, the preservation does not last long), the "grafting" as described above will be conducted immediately for the amino resin or inorganic matter such as the polylysine or aminosilane chip carriers.<br>
In a microfluidic electrophoretic chip, a nano inorganic polymer is adopted for building its base; lithography is used for etching the designed path; testing sample and testing reagent are added into the microchannel; the protein adsorbing surface in the microfluidic chip is increased; and a high analytical sensitivity and a short testing time are achieved. This protein chip can be used for stabilized the activity of proteins in the carrier, such that protein engineers can obtain a large quantity of dedicated proteins used for fabricating the chips. If fermented chitosan or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) nano system is used for fabricating biochips, the invention is applicable for microscopic printing and piezoelectric printing methods. To obtain the information on the behavior of the conductive bond of a DNA, a DNA a metal ion, and a molecular wire of a polymer hybrid, if the<br><br>
surface of a DNA is covered with more metal ions, then it is R-monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA, wherein R refers to a nano inorganic polymer film that forms the electric conducting DNA chain, which can be used in a nano biocircuit. To obtain an active protein, the metal hybrid polymer solution must use the method of increasing the activity by a dry protein enzyme to fabricate biochips. For example, R-monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA together with vitamin C and iron metal or other carboxylic acids and silver metal are used to design the biochips, and the plant fiber-monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA (fermented) is used as an intermediate process, and then the monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNAis extracted and printed on the R which is a nano inorganic polymer film, and changed to a bridge structure of a nano inorganic polymer film-monosaccharide-M-NH2-DNA, so that the dry biochips can promote protein enzymes to improve the activity and maximize the medical testing function of the biochips and provide various different applications. If the nano inorganic polymer film-monosaccharide-Ca-NH2-DNA on the biochip is at this state, the metal ion will be Ca or a complex Ca metal, and the protein enzyme on the chip must have water (moisture absorbability) or must be electrically conducted to enhance the activity, so as to achieve the control of the activity of the protein enzyme on the chip.<br>
The reacting carrier material is a covered nano inorganic polymer which shows a ceramic structure of a PVA-SI-M hybrid (refer to previous paragraph) as the catalyst carrier, and its porosity is above 80%, and it is mixed with 0.1-3% of PVPK-30 evenly in a condensation solution or an oxidizing condensation solution, and the foregoing chemical solutions are poured into the carrier material, so that the chemical solutions is fully absorbed and soaked into the carrier material, and then the carrier material is baked to remove the moisture, and the baking temperature is maintained at 90 for 40 minutes to solidify and store the carrier, and the storage effect is not restricted to time, and it will not be absorbed or shifted<br><br>
by other odors in the air. If the organic solvent gas is passed through the carrier material, the condensation will be conducted. The conditions for the reaction are similar to those for the organic solvent or petroleum gases or organic solvent having similar molecular weight and similar gas structure, and the reaction can be conducted at room temperature and used for the applications performed in a condition having moisture (including water) or air at a dry state. Further, another method of processing waste solvent gas can be used for condensing a chemical solution or oxidizing a condensation solution, and the quantity of the processing waste solvent gas determines the size of the gas-liquid compatible reacting tower, and the reacting speed of solution at room temperature and the gas/solution ratio of the washing tower are used to determine the quantity of the processing solvent for the waste gas treatment. For example, 350L of condensation solution is used, and the washing tower comes with a circular water tank having a capacity of 500L, and the water pump operates at a speed of 201rpm, and the washing tower is a closed system and only has an inlet for injecting the solvent gas and an outlet. The solvent gas will be reacted and condensed with the plastic film, and finally changed to tiny clays and mixed into the solution or floated at the periphery of the reaction tank. The tank has a filter system disposed at its edge and filled with chemical solutions for the reaction and cleaning, so as to discharge the reaction clays, and the discharged clay can be recycled. If a solid fuel is used, such arrangement provides a method for processing solvent gases.<br>
The method of processing a solvent uses a condensation solution or an oxidizing condensation solution and determines the size of the reaction tank according to the quantity of the processing waste liquid solvent and the reacting speed of the solution at room temperature is used to determine the quantity of added waste liquid solvent. For example, 350L of condensation solution is used, and the tank is a circular tank with a capacity of 500L, and the blending machine is<br><br>
operated at a rotary speed of 500 rpm, such that the cover of the tank is sealed and only an axle hole of the blending machine and an inlet for adding solvents are maintained. The tank comes with a filter system at the edge of the tank for the reaction and cleaning, so that clays can be discharged. For example, the quantity of added waste liquid solvent is 150cc/min. and added by a constant adding machine. The reacting solution is blended at a high speed, and a trace of liquid solvent is added slowly, and the blending machine blends the solution at a rotary speed of 100-5000 rpm, such that the liquid solvent will be reacted, condensed and synthesized into a plastic film and finally become a tiny clay mixed into the solution or flowed at the periphery of the reaction tank. The clay is discharged through the filter system, such that the waste liquid solvent can be added slowly all the time, and the discharged clay can be recycled. If a solid fuel is used, this arrangement provides a method for processing a solvent.<br>

The thick liquid and 1-4% of acidified or chlorinated or hydroxidized (referring to nitrified sodium humate) or inorganic polymer monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent metal ions (two or more bivalent metal ions can be mixed partially or separately, and the foregoing 1-3% of metal ions and 0.1-80% of acidified or chlorinated or nitrified or inorganic polymer iron ion has the oxidizing capability for the gas) sufficiently blended, mixed, blended at a rotary speed of 200 rpm, become condensation solution and oxidizing condensation solution and other reacting solution.<br>
