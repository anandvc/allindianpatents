FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a method for deterring birds from roosting, perching<br>
or loafing on plant and solid or structural surfaces.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The co-existence of humans and wild birds has always been an important<br>
relationship for both species. For humans, this relationship has been a pleasant<br>
one esthetically and a useful one ecologically. In the former case, the sights and<br>
sounds of birds are universally enjoyed by people of all ages. In the latter case,<br>
the role of birds in the ecological chain vis-a-vis birds, carrion and other species is<br>
essential. It is, of course, essential that both relationships be preserved.<br>
Notwithstanding the beneficial and pleasant aspects of the interface between wild<br>
birds and humans, the propensity of birds to alight on, occupy and damage solid<br>
surfaces associated with or near human activity frequently becomes a source of<br>
conflict.<br>
A source of conflict between birds and humans is associated with areas of grassy<br>
turf on or around which there is substantial human activity, for example, birds can<br>
frequently become a nuisance and cause substantial damage to pedestrian traveled<br>
areas, such as golf courses, cemeteries and campuses. These areas, which require<br>
substantial upkeep, especially golf courses, suffer much due to birds nesting and<br>
gathering on them. For example, they can become a distraction because of the<br>
noise a flock can generate. Birds also become a nuisance because of the fecal<br>
deposits they leave. Fecal deposits are not only a nuisance due to the mess they<br>
cause, but also a public health concern due to the parasites and/or the disease that<br>
live in and spread from the droppings.<br>
Another area of major concern is roosting birds near the end of runways at<br>
commercial and military airports. Roosting birds can cause "bird strikes" whereby<br>
many birds take flight near aircraft that are taking off or landing, which result in<br>
birds colliding with the aircraft or being sucked into the engines. This causes<br>
damage to the aircraft by damaging the canopy or the wings and engines. In some<br>
instances, birds have caused aircraft engines to fail completely and the plane to<br>
crash, which results in complete loss of the aircraft and in some instances has<br>
resulted in loss of human life. The Federal Aviation Administration receives as<br>
many as 2,000 reports of bird strikes each year. Major airlines report they sustain<br>
over $12 million of damage per year. Roosting birds like the open spaces around<br>
the runways. Due to this fact, approximately ninety percent of the bird strike<br>
damages occur around airports. Statistics show that bird strikes are growing in<br>
number due to (1) the increase in bird population, (2) nesting of more birds in<br>
urban areas, (3) fewer natural predators of birds, and (4) the marginal effectiveness<br>
of common bird harassment techniques. Bird strikes therefore remain a very<br>
dangerous and costly problem.<br>
A further example of the problems, which can arise at the interface between birds<br>
and humans, are the effects of the presence of birds in areas for public gatherings.<br>
For example, the ubiquitous presence of bird feces in public places presents<br>
problems of sanitation for people. Furthermore, the deposition of bird feces on<br>
metal surfaces often causes problems of corrosion. Birds, such as woodpeckers,<br>
also frequently cause damage to woody and other non-metal surfaces by pecking<br>
on them. Birds are also frequent inhabitants of the exposed steel and concrete<br>
framework of structures, such as sports arenas and aircraft hangars, from which<br>
their feces present problems to both equipment and people. In addition, roof<br>
damage often occurs at locations where the flashing becomes corroded by bird<br>
feces.<br>
Over the course of many years, a large number of procedures have been suggested<br>
and tried to overcome the above-described problems associated with birds and<br>
man-made structural surfaces. However, these have largely had only limited<br>
success. One example of such devices is an ultrasonic device which birds, but not<br>
humans, can hear. Another approach is to coat the problem surfaces with a sticky<br>
liquid or gelatin which birds find uncomfortable. Of course, the classic bird<br>
repellent method is the use of scarecrows or other arrangements which are<br>
frightening to the birds by virtue of their appearance and movement. A still<br>
further technique is the use of replicas of predators such as hawks, eagles and<br>
owls. Flashing lights have also been used for this purpose. Even the sound of<br>
cannons has been used. None of these, however, has been sufficiently effective<br>
because (1) the deterrent effect does not last long; (2) they are expensive to run;<br>
(3) they constitute a nuisance to humans in the vicinity; or (4) they require too<br>
frequent maintenance.<br>
Therefore, a serious need continues for a reliable and economical method to deter<br>
birds from alighting on, occupying and damaging plant and structural surfaces in<br>
such manner that neither the environment nor the birds are harmed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In its primary aspect, the invention is therefore directed to a method for deterring<br>
birds from roosting, loafing and perching on plant and solid or structural surfaces<br>
comprising applying to the surface a non-toxic composition that triggers a<br>
physiological aversion mechanism in said birds.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The Drawing consists of two sheets. The first sheet contains Figures 1(a) through<br>
1(e), in which various particulated forms of polycyclic quinone are depicted<br>
schematically. The second sheet contains Figure 2, which is a graphical<br>
representation of the data obtained in Example 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Introduction<br>
Many kinds of wildlife use visual cues to identify food in the environment in a<br>
manner similar to humans. Most species of animals use both long distance vision<br>
and close visual inspection to recognize food. In the case of birds, however, the<br>
visual acuity is much different than that of humans. Humans are capable of<br>
sensing light having a wave length in the single range of 400 to 700 nm.<br>
However, birds can see light in two visual spectra simultaneously. In particular,<br>
birds can detect light in the wave length ranges of 500-700 nm as well as 300-400<br>
nm. Thus, birds can identify food which reflects light in the ultra violet range,<br>
which is invisible to humans, down to the limits of the sun" UV radiation at the<br>
earth" surface.<br>
Using these principles, applicants have determined that a broad class of polycyclic<br>
quinones, which absorb light in various wave lengths within the range of 200-300<br>
nm and which have taste or post-ingestional response, are effective to repel birds<br>
from feeding on a wide variety of plant seeds and surfaces<br>
It is not necessary that the light-absorbing materials absorb light throughout the<br>
range of 200-300 nm. It is sufficient that the material absorb a narrow band of<br>
light within that range sufficient to bring about a visually detectable shift in color<br>
perception by the bird. Thus, even if a narrow wave length-absorbing material is<br>
used, the surface is nevertheless distinctly marked by the resultant shift in the<br>
color of the coated surface as perceived by the bird.<br>
In some cases, the bird is deterred by the color shift alone. In other cases, it<br>
appears that the bird samples the material. The total repellency effect of the<br>
compositions of the invention is, therefore, based on both sampling the compound<br>
and visual detection. In its broadest aspect, the invention is, therefore, directed to<br>
the use of non-toxic organic materials, which absorb light within the range of200-<br>
400 nm, and which cause post-ingestional irritation or response when consumed.<br>
Polycyclic Quinones<br>
Composition<br>
A wide variety of polycyclic quinones can be used in the invention. As used<br>
herein, the term "polycyclic quinone" refers to bicyclic, tricyclic and tetracyclic<br>
condensed ring quinones and hydroquinones, as well as precursors thereof. On the<br>
whole, the non-ionic polycyclic quinones and polycyclic hydroquinones (herein<br>
referred to collectively as PCQs) have very low solubility in water at ambient<br>
temperatures. For use in the invention, it is preferred that such PCQs have a water<br>
solubility no higher than about 1,000 ppm, by weight.<br>
- However, as noted above, certain precursors of such PCQs can also be used in the<br>
invention, either combined with the relatively insoluble PCQs or by themselves.<br>
Such precursors are anionic salts of PCQs which are water soluble under alkaline<br>
anaerobic conditions. However, these materials are not stable and are easily<br>
converted to the insoluble quinone form upon exposure to air. Thus, when anionic<br>
PCQs are applied to plants and exposed to air, they are quickly changed to the<br>
water-insoluble, more active quinone form.<br>
Among the water-insoluble PCQs that can be used in the invention are<br>
anthraquinone, 1,2-dihydroxy anthraquinone, 1,4-dihydroxy anthraquinone,<br><br>
naphthoquinone, anthrone(9,10-dihydro-9-oxo-anthracene), 10-methylene-<br>
anthrone, phenanthrenequinone and the alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives of<br>
such quinones, 6,11 -dioxo-1H-anthra[ 1,2-c]pyrazole, anthraquinone-1,2-<br>
naphthacridone, 7,12-dioxo-7,12-dihydroanthra[ 1,2-b]pyrazine, 1,2-<br>
benzanthraquinone, 2,7-dimethylanthraquinone, 2-methylanthraquinone, 3-<br>
methylanthraquinone, 1-aminoanthraquinone and 1-methoxyanthraquinone. In<br>
addition, more complex polycyclic quinone compounds can be used, such as 2-<br>
carboxy-l,3,5,6,8-pentahydroxy-7-monosaccharide and other saccharides of<br>
anthraquinones or glucosamides and 2(l,3-dihydro-3-oxy-5-sulfo-2H-indol-2-<br>
ylidine)-2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-lH-indole-5-sulfonic acid, disodium salt. Of the<br>
foregoing cyclic ketones, anthraquinone and 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone are<br>
preferred because they appear to be more effective. Naturally occurring<br>
anthraquinones can be used as well as synthetic anthraquinones.<br>
Other PCQs which can be used include insoluble anthraquinone compounds, such<br>
as 1,8-dihydroxy-anthraquinone, 1-amino-anthraquinone, 1-chloro-anthraquinone,<br>
2-chloro-anthraquinone, 2-chloro-3-carboxyl-anthraquinone and 1-hydroxy-<br>
anthraquinone. Various ionic derivatives of these materials can be prepared by<br>
catalytic reduction in aqueous alkali.<br>
In addition, a wide variety of anthrahydroquinone compounds can be used in the<br>
method of the invention. As used herein, the term "anthrahydroquinone<br>
" compound" refers to compounds comprising the basic tricyclic structure such as<br>
9,10-dihydroanthrahydroquinone, 1,4-dihydroanthrahydroquinone, and l,4,4a,9a-<br>
tetrahydroanthirahydroquinone. Anthrahydroquinone itself is 9,10-<br>
dihydroxyanthracene.<br>
More particularly, both water-insoluble and water-soluble forms can be used. The<br>
non-ionic compounds are largely insoluble in aqueous systems, while ionic<br>
derivatives, such as di-alkali metal salts, are largely soluble in water. The water<br>
soluble forms are stable only in high pH anaerobic fluids. Low pH fluids (pH less<br>
than about 9-10) will result in the formation of the insoluble molecular<br>
anthrahydroaquinone. Aerobic solutions will incur oxidation of the anthraquinones<br>
to anthraquinone. Thus, anthrahydroquinones will not exist for long periods of<br>
time in an aerated environment, such as that which is experienced by spraying.<br>
For these reasons, anthrahydroquinone treatments are usually implemented with<br>
the soluble ionic form in a caustic solution. Sodium hydroxide solutions are<br>
preferred over the hydroxides of other alkali metals for economic reasons.<br>
Configuration<br>
The PCQ used should be in physical form small enough to be touched by the<br>
sensory organs of the bird. Thus, for the PCQ to be more effective as a repellent, it<br>
is preferred to be of sufficiently small particle size that its presence can be sensed.<br>
Thus, the more effective quantity of repellent in any application is that which is in<br>
a form accessible to the birds' nerve endings; that is, it should be of sufficiently<br>
small size that it can be orally sensed.<br>
Generally, because of these criteria, particles larger than about 50 micrometers<br>
cannot be adequately sensed and particles no larger than 30 micrometers are<br>
preferred. Similarly, smooth continuous surfaces of PCQ cannot be adequately<br>
sensed; and, of course, if the PCQ is coated with anything which is non-repellent<br>
to the bird or to which the bird is taste insensitive, the PCQ is ineffective.<br>
Though, strictly speaking, for the PCQ to be effective as a repellent it does not<br>
. have to be in the form of discrete particles; nevertheless, the particles must be of<br>
sufficient size or have a contour that contains areas that are taste-accessible. This<br>
criterion is illustrated in the Drawing.<br>
The particle in Figure 1(a) would be accessible because it is sufficiently small.<br>
The particle in Figure 1(b) would be less effective because it is too large to be<br>
sensed effectively. The smooth continuous coating in Figure 1(c) would create<br>
little or no taste sensation because the large continuous surface would not have<br>
adequate access to the birds' nerve endings. On the other hand, the continuous<br>
coating shown in Figure 1(d) would create at least moderate taste sensation<br>
because the protrusions on the coating are sufficiently small to be tasted. In this<br>
situation, the PCQ in the protrusions would be effective, but the PCQ in the main<br>
body of the coating would be less so, if at all. When the particles are portrayed as<br>
stacks of particles, as in Figure 1(e), it can be seen that some of the particles in<br>
the upper layers would be accessible and therefore would be effective; but those<br>
particles in the lower layer would be less accessible and therefore less effective.<br>
The foregoing analysis shows clearly that the efficacy of the repellent is a<br>
function of both its configuration and accessibility. In turn, it can be seen that<br>
these variables are in large part dependent on the method of application.<br>
When the PCQ is applied directly in particulate form, the size of the particles can<br>
be readily controlled. When such particles are applied as a single layer of<br>
particles, substantially all of the PCQ would be effective. However, if the<br>
particles are applied as a multiple of particle layers, essentially only the top layer<br>
would be effective. An important aspect of this analysis is that it is not important<br>
that the PCQ be applied as continuous covering. To the contrary, it is better that<br>
the coating of PCQ particles be discontinuous, at least on a micro scale, to enable<br>
functional exposure of the stomata of the foliage. Thus, the particles to be<br>
effective must be "particulated" in the sense that they contain areas which are<br>
accessible to the avian taste nerve endings.<br>
It is the inventor's determination, in view of the Examples, that it is preferred that<br>
the polycyclic quinone be applied to the surface to be treated at a level ranging<br>
from 0.2 mg/sq meter to 50 mg/sq meter of surface. It is more preferred that the<br>
polycyclic quinone be applied to 25 mg/sq meter of surface to be treated.<br>
Physical Properties - Volatility, Water Solubility<br>
It is important to the effectiveness of the invention that the PCQ, in whatever<br>
physical form it is applied, be persistent. That is, the applied active material must<br>
be able to resist erosion by wind and rain and other environmental forces to which<br>
the treated surface is exposed. For this reason, it is preferred (1) that the active<br>
form of the PCQ have a relatively low solubility in water so that it is not easily<br>
washed off the treated surfaces, and (2) that it have a relatively high melting<br>
temperature so that it does not undergo excessive evaporation or sublimation from<br>
the treated surfaces during exposure to high ambient temperatures. For these<br>
reasons, it is preferred that the active PCQ material has a solubility in water under<br>
ambient temperature conditions of no more than about 1000 ppm and preferably at<br>
least 10-200 ppm and that the melting temperature of the active PCQ component<br>
be at least about 150°C and preferably at least 200C.<br>
Even when the active PCQ material possesses the above-described preferred<br>
physical properties, the material may have poor persistence because it does not<br>
adhere well to the surface to which it is applied. This is a function of the different<br>
properties of the surface and the PCQ material. When this occurs, it is further<br>
preferred that the formulation contain a "sticking agent", i.e., a material which<br>
itself has good adhesion to the substrate and when mixed with the active material<br>
causes the PCQ to adhere to the substrate more firmly. Preferred sticking agents<br>
are aqueous polymer lattices, which upon evaporation of the water therefrom,<br>
form a polymeric mass which is highly adhesive to the plant surface and holds<br>
particles of the active material firmly on the plant or solid surface. Such sticking<br>
agents typically contain a small amount of surfactant dissolved in the aqueous<br>
phase.<br>
Even though highly water-insoluble PCQ compounds are preferred, less insoluble<br>
compounds are nevertheless usable in the invention under conditions in which<br>
they are not unduly exposed to conditions by which they are washed off.<br>
Furthermore, the use of water-resistant sticking agents can be used to mitigate the<br>
washing effect of heavy rains.<br>
A distinct advantage of the PCQ compounds that have been tested for use in the<br>
invention is that they are essentially non toxic, i.e., they have an LD50 of at least<br>
2,000 mg/kg in rats and preferably an LD50 in rats of 5,000 mg/kg or higher.<br>
Because of this low toxicity of PCQs, they are not toxic to most insects or to birds,<br>
animals and humans. Moreover, the toxicity level is sufficiently low that any<br>
active material that becomes leached into the soil will not be detrimental to the<br>
normal constituents of fertile soil layers.<br>
It is important to note that the source of the PCQ used for bird repellency is an<br>
important criteria to ensure low toxicity. For example, applicants have registered<br>
with the U.S. EPA the PCQ known as 9,10-anthraquinone as a safe, non-toxic<br>
PCQ for use as a bird repellent (see U.S. EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet for<br>
Anthraquinone, December 1998). It is within the scope of those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art to substitute other non-toxic PCQ's in place of anthraquinone for<br>
use in the present invention.<br>
Coadjuvants<br>
As used herein, the term "coadjuvant" refers to materials which have a bio-activity<br>
different than the polycyclic quinones themselves. Such materials include contact<br>
repellents, fungicides, pesticides, and mixtures thereof. Both liquid and solid<br>
coadjuvants can be used in conjunction with the PCQ's of the invention,<br>
depending on the manner of application. (See discussion below.) It should be<br>
noted, however, that the use of fungicides and pesticides as adjuvants may not be<br>
preferred because of the poisonous nature of such adjuvants.<br>
An important class of coadjuvant for use in combination with the PCQs are<br>
trigeminal repellents, i.e., repellents which repel birds when the bird tastes the<br>
material. It has been found that terpene-based compounds are particularly useful<br>
for this purpose. Limonene, pinene and pulegone are terpenes which are preferred<br>
for this purpose. However, polymeric terpenes are also useful for this purpose,<br>
especially low molecular weight polymeric terpenes, which are sticky in character.<br>
When terpenes are used as co-repellents with PCQs, they will ordinarily constitute<br>
a major part of the composition and the PCQs will constitute only a minor part.<br>
For example, composition comprising as little as 1% wt. PCQ in terpene<br>
(including polymeric terpenes) can be used effectively. Though still higher PCQ<br>
concentrations can be used, it will not be necessary to use more than about 10%<br>
wt. On the other hand, as little as 10% wt. terpene compound can be used, at least<br>
30% being preferred to enhance the contact repellency properties.<br>
Other trigeminal repellents, such as pepper and 2-hydroxyacetophenone, and<br>
methylanthranalate, can also be used in admixture with the PCQ and admixtures<br>
of PCQ with other trigeminal repellents.<br>
Additives<br>
As used herein, the term "additives" refers to materials which augment the<br>
effectiveness of the compositions of the invention, but which do not by themselves<br>
have bio-activity. These include such materials as surfactants, wetting agents,<br>
defoaming agents, extenders, sticking agents, penetrants, plasticizers, activators,<br>
spreading agents, diluents, odorants and the like.<br>
When the PCQs are in powder form, they can be dispersed in a liquid media,<br>
especially water, and sprayed as a liquid suspension. On the other hand, when<br>
water-soluble precursors of the PCQs are used, they can be dissolved in water for<br>
dilution and then applied by spraying in the usual manner. The aeration, which<br>
occurs during spraying is sufficient to convert the soluble salt to the more active<br>
water-insoluble form. In both of these techniques either solid or liquid<br>
coadjuvants can be used. For example, water-soluble coadjuvants can be<br>
dissolved in the liquid medium or water-insoluble coadjuvant particles can be<br>
suspended in the liquid medium along with the PCQ and/or PCQ precursor.<br>
In general, quite dilute applications of the PCQs to surfaces are effective to deter<br>
bird presence. For example, the application of liquid dispersions containing as<br>
little as 100 ppm by weight PCQs can be effective. At least 1000 ppm is<br>
preferred. It will be recognized, however, that the effective dose level of the<br>
active component varies widely, both with the type of bird infestation and the<br>
composition of the active component. Fortunately, higher concentrations of PCQs<br>
can be tolerated with complete safety both to the environment, to humans, and to<br>
the birds to be deterred.<br>
It will be recognized from the foregoing discussion that not all of the PCQ<br>
coatings may be of suitable configuration. However, so long as a sufficient<br>
fraction of the coating is available to the birds' nerve endings, the composition<br>
will effectively deter them from the surface. As mentioned above, access of the<br>
PCQ repellent to the oral sensors of the bird may occur during preening of body<br>
parts which contain the repellent as a result of contact with the treated surfaces.<br>
It will be recognized that other dispersion media than water can be used. For<br>
example, safe, degradable oils, such as vegetable oils, can be used. However,<br>
from the standpoint of safety and environmental health, it is much preferred to use<br>
water.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the following Examples, three series of tests were carried out to observe the<br>
efficacy of the invention to deter birds from perching, loafing and/or roosting on<br>
areas of grassy turf, and structural surfaces.<br>
Deterrence from Loafing/Roosting on Areas of Grassy Turf<br>
Example 1<br>
A formulation containing 50% wt., basis total formulation, of 9,10-anthraquinone<br>
dispersed in water with a small amount of surfactant and thickener was prepared<br>
and sprayed onto untreated grassy turf in an area where geese normally loaf or<br>
roost. One-third acre of turf was treated with areas of untreated turf bordering on<br>
both sides of the treated area. The dispersed anthraquinone particles were applied<br>
at a rate of 1 pint/acre (approximately 50 mg/m2) on the treated area. The test<br>
areas were observed for approximately four weeks to determine the effects of the<br>
treated versus the untreated areas. The differences in the effects of the treated area<br>
versus the untreated area were easily noted. Geese loafing/roosting in the<br>
untreated areas were unaffected and exhibited normal behavior as they fed and<br>
were not repelled. Geese that entered the treated area began to feed, but<br>
immediately ceased eating, exited the treated area, entered a nearby pond and<br>
began to wash or rinse themselves. After this exhibited behavior, none of the<br>
geese feeding on the untreated areas entered the treated areas. The geese were<br>
repelled from the treated area for approximately two weeks until the turf was cut.<br>
After cutting, another treatment was applied. The dispersed anthraquinone<br>
particles were applied at a rate of 1/2 pint/acre (approximately 25 mg/m2) in the<br>
same manner of treating one strip of turf bordered by untreated turf. The same<br>
repellency was exhibited. The test was continued for approximately two weeks.<br>
The test was concluded due to snow.<br>
Example 2<br>
A grassy test site having an area of 6.2 acres was selected within the grounds of a<br>
large campus style research complex having a substantial flock of geese in<br>
residence, which numbers 250-300 geese during the day and as many as 500 geese<br>
in the evening hours. In order to determine when daily observations should be<br>
made, the site was observed beforehand to determine the times during which the<br>
maximum number of geese were on the test site. Observations were conducted at<br>
the same time(s) each day in such manner that the behavior of the geese could be<br>
observed without disturbance. In addition, the number of droppings in selected<br>
areas of the site were counted each day, recorded and then removed from the test<br>
area by raking.<br>
Following 10 days observation of the untreated test site, the above-described<br>
goose repellent composition was sprayed on the test area using a calibrated spray<br>
tank and a fan-shaped head sprayer. The liquid spray contained one gallon of<br>
repellent per 140 gallons of water and the rate of application was 2.77 pounds of<br>
AQ per acre of the mixture. In the absence of rain, the applied composition fully<br>
dried on the blades of grass within 24 hours.<br>
During the week before application of the repellent composition, the goose counts<br>
taken in the afternoon were from about 45 to 305 geese with an average of about<br>
150 geese. Following application of the bird repellent composition, the goose<br>
count was about 110 the following day, but dropped to zero a day later. More<br>
complete test data are given in Figure 3 of the Drawing.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2 of the Drawing, it can be seen that between days 1 and 3,<br>
the number of geese in the test area dropped substantially from over 200 to 48.<br>
This drop in the number of geese appears to have resulted from the departure of a<br>
migrant flock from the test area. However, the number of geese began to grow in<br>
day 5 and reached a maximum of over 300 by day 10 of the test. After making<br>
the count on day 10, the test area was treated with PCQ's in the manner described<br>
above.<br>
By day 11, the number of geese dropped to 109 and on day 12 the number of<br>
geese was reduced to zero. During days 12-23, only a few geese were observed<br>
from time-to-time. On day 18, several geese (18) were observed in the test area;<br>
but, as indicated by the very low quantity of droppings, it is apparent that the<br>
flock, which was probably migratory, was repelled from the test area before the<br>
next day. Following a heavy rain, on day 23, the goose count rose to 27 and the<br>
number of droppings rose to 13. This minor increase in the number of geese<br>
appeared to result from some of the treating material's being washed off the grass.<br>
After treatment of the test area, large numbers of birds were observed milling<br>
around, but not entering the treated area.<br>
Since completion of the tests carried out in this Example, it has been noted that the<br>
number of geese in the treated area, as compared to the number in the surrounding<br>
untreated areas;, remained quite low for a period more than 3 months following the<br>
treatment. This phenomenon was quite unexpected in view of the fact that the<br>
treating material in the test area had been largely dissipated by heavy rains. Such<br>
prolonged deterrent effect is believed to be a result of memory by the geese who<br>
had initially been exposed to the polycyclic quinone treating material.<br>
Deterrence from Roosting/Loafing on and Occupying Structural Surfaces<br>
In the following examples, the treating material was an aqueous dispersion of<br>
small particles of 9,10-anthraquinone containing 50% by weight of the<br>
anthraquinone and a small amount of surfactant.<br>
Example 3<br>
A large number of seagulls regularly roosted on the flat roof of an industrial<br>
building in Northern California. Upon application to the roof of the above-<br>
described composition, the gulls did not further use the surface for roosting.<br>
Example 4<br>
In Philadelphia PA, a large number of crows, estimated at over two hundred<br>
thousand, regularly roosted on the flat roof of an industrial building. Upon<br>
spraying the surface of the roof with the above-described composition, the crows<br>
did not return.<br>
Example 5<br>
Pigeons regularly roosted on the exposed steel beams within a large aircraft<br>
hangar in Wilmington DE. Upon spraying exposed surfaces of the exposed steel<br>
beams with the above-described composition, the pigeons did not return.<br>
Example 6<br>
Four ounces of a 50% by weight dispersion of anthraquinone in water were mixed<br>
with 29 gallons of water. The mixture was sprayed on a twenty foot section of a<br>
metal beam in the superstructure of a large sports arena. The treated beam section<br>
was open to the atmosphere and had become a roost for pigeons. Prior to the<br>
treatment, a section of walkway beneath the beam was cleaned weekly of 50-60<br>
bird droppings. After more than 30 days following treatment of the beam with the<br>
above-described dilute anthraquinone dispersion, the pigeons had not returned to<br>
the roosting site.<br>
Example 7<br>
Evaluation of AQ As An Avian Perching Deterrent<br>
Methods<br>
Two (2) pens (10 x 20 x 6 feet) constructed of wood and aviary wire in a roofed<br>
outdoor aviary with a concrete floor were erected. At one end of each pen a water<br>
bowl and a food bowl containing the birds' maintenance diet was provided. On<br>
the morning of day 1, the test birds were transferred from their holding cages to<br>
each of the test pens. In each pen, there was one centrally located perch. At 0800<br>
on the morning of day 2, this perch was removed and 2 test perches were installed,<br>
one in each of the corners at the end of the pen away from the food and water. For<br>
red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and brown-headed cowbirds<br>
(Molothrus ater), the perches were made of aluminum rod, 1.2m long and 1.0 cm<br>
in diameter. For fish crows (Corvus ossigragus), the test perches were hollow<br>
stainless steel pipe, 1.2-m long and 2.25 cm in diameter. One of the test perches<br>
(randomly determined) was coated with a product containing 50% AQ as the<br>
active ingredient (the "repellent"), and the other was uncoated. The repellent was<br>
applied to the perches with a paint brush 24 - 48 hours before the test. The<br>
repellent was easily applied and appeared somewhat like thinned paint. It covered<br>
the metal surfaces very well, with some streaking, and formed an opaque coating<br>
that was dry to the touch by the start of the trial. Approximately 7.5 g wet weight<br>
was applied to each crow perch and approximately 3.5 g to each<br>
blackbird/cowbird perch.<br>
Test perches remained in the pens until 1500 on day 3 at which time the birds<br>
were captured, banded and released. The activity was videotaped in each pen<br>
during 3 30-min periods daily: 0800 - 0830, 1100 - 1130, and 1400 - 1430. The<br>
videotapes were reviewed to determine bird use of the perches. The number of<br>
birds on each of the test perches were recorded at 1-min intervals. Activity and<br>
locations of birds not on the perches was also noted. Five (5) groups of blackbirds<br>
and cowbirds and 4 groups of fish crows were tested. For blackbirds and<br>
cowbirds, there were 4 birds in each test group. For fish crows, we used 2 birds<br>
per pen.<br>
To analyze responses of the birds to the perch treatment, the mean number of birds<br>
on each perch during each of the 6 30-min observation periods was used. The data<br>
are expressed as birds/min. A separate 2-way repeated measures analysis of<br>
variance for each of the 3 bird species was performed to test the null hypothesis of<br>
equal use between the two perches.<br>
Results <br>
Red-winged blackbirds - Use of the untreated perch<br>
(x=0.86 birds/min.,SE=0.10) was more than twice (P = 0.067, F1, 8= 4.50) that<br>
of the treated perch (x = 0.41 birds/min, SE = 0.06). Total perch use did not vary<br>
between days (P = 0.557, F1,48= 0.35). There was a strong interaction between<br>
day and perch (P 
untreated perch and decrease use of the treated perch from day 1 to day 2 (Table<br>
1)<br>
Brown-headed cowbirds - Use of the untreated perch<br>
(x = 1.70 birds/min, SE = 0.23) exceeded (P = 0.015, F1, 8= 9.47)that of the treated<br>
perch (x = 0.62 birds/min, SE = 0.14). Total perch use declined<br>
(P = 0.003, F1,48= 9.47) from day 1 (x = 1.51 birds/min., SE = 0.22) to day 2<br>
(x = 0.81 birds/min., SE = 0.17). There was no interaction between day and perch<br>
(P = 0.222, F1,48 = 1.53) as bird use of each perch declined on the second day<br>
(Table 2).<br>
Fish crows — Use of the untreated perch (x — 1.28 birds/min., SE = 0.08) was<br>
approximately twice (P = 0.014, F1,6 = 11.70) that of the treated perch<br>
(x = 0.64 birds/min., SE = 0.08). Total perch use did not vary between days<br>
(P = 0.734, F1,38 = 0.12). The interaction between day and perch<br>
(P = 0.090, F1,38 = 3.03) reflected increased use of the untreated perch and<br>
decreased use of the treated perch from day 1 to day 2 (Table 3).<br>
Discussion<br>
Over the course of these 2-day trials, each of the 3 test species displayed a<br>
preference for the untreated perch over the one coated with repellent. Heretofore,<br>
the repellent has been considered a feeding deterrent, with the active ingredient,<br>
9,10-anthraquinone, causing postingestional distress or imitation to birds eating<br>
treated food. It is somewhat surprising therefore to find that birds also find it<br>
unappealing to use perches painted with this repellent.<br>
The mechanism of this apparent perch repellency is unclear. No initial reluctance<br>
by birds to use the treated perches was observed, so it is unlikely that the<br>
appearance of the treated perch was offensive. Similarly, when birds perched on<br>
the treated perch, no indication that they were uncomfortable or bothered by the<br>
feel of the perch was observed, so an adverse tactile stimulus can be ruled out.<br>
Contact irritation would not be expected as birds, exposed to anthraquinone on<br>
food display no sign of irritation.<br>
Dermal uptake through the feet, however, is a possible route of exposure. The<br>
extent to which this might have occurred is unknown, but dermal toxicity of Flight<br>
Control is low (acute dermal LD50 in rats &gt; 5000 mg/kg, pesticide fact sheet for<br>
anthraquinone, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, December 1998).<br>
Accidental ingestion of the repellent is another possible means by which birds<br>
might have been exposed. Birds frequently wiped their bills on the perch when<br>
they returned from feeding or drinking. Birds also used their feet to scratch the<br>
facial area around the bill. It is possible that during these maintenance activities,<br>
the birds accidentally ingested the repellent. Conceivably, through repeated<br>
exposure in this manner, birds could have associated illness or malaise with the<br>
treated perch and acquired a learned avoidance response. On the videotapes, no<br>
sign of illness was observed (e.g. decreased activity, fluffed fethers, vomiting).<br>
The temporal patterns of perch use exhibited by red-winged blackbirds (Table 1)<br>
and fish crows (Table 3) are consistent with learned avoidance. For each species,<br>
differential use of the untreated perch increased from the first to the second test<br>
day. Conversely, cowbird behavior was not consistent with this pattern (Table 2).<br>
Cowbirds tended to reduce their use of both perches which suggests that they were<br>
not able to distinguish the source of their discomfort. Thus, they spent more time<br>
on the floor of the pen.<br><br><br>
Pen and field observations of bird behavior were made throughout the studies. In<br>
no situation were adverse effects or discomfort to the observed birds. In feeding<br>
on rice seeds, the birds squeezed the grain from the hull then ejected the hull from<br>
their mouths and ate only the inner grain. During this feeding activity, which<br>
maximized contact with AQ, the treated seeds did not affect the birds' behavior or<br>
induce pain. Consumption of AQ did not affect feeding behavior, in terms of<br>
grams of feed per day.<br>
Upon completion of all studies, the test birds were released near the original point<br>
of capture. No test birds died due to exposure to the AQ. In a separate study, we<br>
found the LD50 of AQ in northern bobwhite quail to be in excess of 2,000 mg/kg<br>
body weight.<br>
