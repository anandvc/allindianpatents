				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to terminal bushings adaptable to low and<br>
medium voltage electrical applications for example AC-motors. The invention<br>
more particularly relates to an integrated partial discharge free epoxy based<br>
terminal bushing device capable of withstanding momentary high fault current.<br>
The invention further relates to a process of manufacturing such an integrated<br>
epoxy based terminal bushing device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terminal bushings are essential for low and medium voltage electrical appliances<br>
like AC motors. Conventional terminal bushings use a central high tension<br>
conductor integrated with a radial built-up insulation of epoxy. The length of the<br>
bushing on either side of the system commensurate with the medium like air.<br>
The bushing assembly is housed in a terminal box with suitable fixing<br>
arrangement. The reliability of the above system is governed by following<br>
parameters:<br>
•	Quality of the metal conductor and connectors during service.<br>
•	Void free preparation of the epoxy insulation.<br>
•	Heat conduction and thermal expansion based incompatibilities.<br>
•	Life of epoxy insulation.<br>
Since conventional terminal bushings are moulded as a single piece i.e.,<br>
integrated in nature, it is difficult to replace or to maintain if there is a minor<br>
damage to the conductor or to the insulator. The conventional bushing can not<br>
withstand higher fault currents as the HT conductor is integrated with epoxy<br>
insulation. This is mainly due to difference in thermal expansion of epoxy and HT<br>
conductor. The differences in thermal expansion of these materials may become<br>
a critical problem at higher fault currents due to increase in dimensions of the<br><br><br>
conductor. Alternatively, performance of the terminal bushing at higher fault<br>
currents can be improved by isolating HT conductor from the epoxy insulation.<br>
However, the arrangement may not be able to withstand for medium voltage<br>
systems due to discharges in service. This is due to an air gap between<br>
conductor and epoxy body.<br>
In terminal bushings, the LT insert can be part of epoxy body. The LT insert is<br>
designed by using studs, which are placed, in position by means of a high<br>
conductive wire with suitable number of turns. However, this design may not be<br>
suitable for high fault current applications. This may be due to the fact that the<br>
collar of the insulator undergoes for severe Electro-dynamic forces during faults.<br>
In practice, there is a possibility of cracks in ellipse collar due to a bit of over-<br>
tightening or unexpected mechanical forces. Thus, for mechanical integrity, more<br>
number of studs is required for fastening to the terminal box. However, the<br>
economical bushings like using ellipse collars may not allow for such option.<br>
Alternatively, the LT insert is provided on the outer surface of the epoxy body.<br>
The outer surface of the LT insert is provided with a locking arrangement to<br>
ensure fastening to connecting modules like terminal box or mounting flanges.<br>
However, the arrangement may not be reliable at higher system voltage. The<br>
interface between LT flange and insulator becomes critical and may lead to<br><br><br>
discharges at higher system voltage. To overcome these problems along with<br>
improving the design for dielectric/mechanical integrity, a new LT insert has<br>
been proposed.<br>
US patent publication US 2005/0199418 discloses a dielectric bushing in<br>
particular a high voltage bushing for a high-voltage apparatus . According to this<br>
invention, in order to realize the field control in the field-stressed zone (7; 7a,<br>
7b), at least one screening electrode (6; 6a, 6b) arranged in the interior (20) of<br>
the insulator part (2; 2a, 2b; 2c) is eliminated and replaced with a non-linear<br>
electric and/or dielectric field control element (9; 9a, 9b; 9i, 9o; 9s) on the<br>
insulator part (2; 2a, 2b; 2c) in the region of the first installation flange (4; 8).<br>
Among other things, embodiments refer to: design criteria for the geometric<br>
arrangement and for the specific materials of the field control element (9; 9a,<br>
9b; 9i, 9o; 9s), in particular various axial and radial arrangements of field control<br>
elements (9; 9a, 9b; 9i, 9o; 9s), as well as the realization of the field control<br>
element (9; 9a, 9b; 9i, 9o; 9s) in the form of a coating or of a massive element<br>
that absorbs mechanical forces.<br><br><br>
US Patent no. US 4965407 describes a bushing system for high voltage electrical<br>
equipment which includes a weathershed with integral annular shirts molded<br>
around an electrical conductor. The weathershed has a cavity at its base for<br>
mating with the opening in the housing for the high voltage electrical equipment.<br>
A dielectric gas in the housing communicates with the cavity in the weathershed.<br>
A flange and seal are provided at the base of the weathershed for sealingly<br>
connecting the bushing system to the housing. A secondary ground may also be<br>
provided.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be described with the help of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a conventional terminal bushings which use a central high tension<br>
(HT) conductor integrated with a radial built-up insulation of epoxy. The bushing<br>
assembly is housed in a terminal box with suitable fixing arrangement.<br>
Figs. 2 &amp; 3 shows a high tension (HT) sleeve [04] made of brass or stainless<br>
steel arranged at the center of the mould. The periphery of the sleeve [04] is<br>
provided with plurality of step cut surface and knurled surface [05] to enhance<br>
the mechanical strength of the bushing [14] at the interface of epoxy [13] and<br>
the sleeve [04]. A HT conductor [06] designed to have provision for tightening of<br>
a lock nut [07] at either end is inserted via the sleeve [04].<br>
Figs 4 &amp; 5 describe a LT sleeve [08] proposed as a part of the epoxy body (13).<br>
The surface of the LT sleeve [08] is provided with a knurling [09] to enhance the<br>
mechanical strength of the bushing [14] at the interface of epoxy [13] and the<br>
LT insert [08]. To improve the mechanical strength of the insulator (13) further,<br>
small dia holes (10) are made on the sleeve (08). These holes (10) will be helpful<br>
for holding of epoxy to the sleeve (08). The dimensions of the LT sleeve (08) is<br>
based on the proof voltage as well as test voltage required for the device<br>
proposed to be Partial Discharge (PD) free. The sleeve (08) can be even in<br>
ellipse profile depending on the space availability for fastening the bushing (09)<br>
to the terminal box. Suitable studs (11) have been welded to the LT sleeve (08)<br>
and the whole arrangement will be part of an epoxy body (13). The projected<br>
studs (11) commensurate with the fastening means provided in the terminal box<br>
for necessary fixing arrangements. The LT insert provides enough mechanical<br>
strength and arrests the cracks at collar portions (12).<br>
Fig. 5 shows that the HT conductor (06) which is not an integral part of the<br>
epoxy body (13) of the proposed terminal bushing (14) is inserted through the<br>
epoxy body (13) to serve as an electrical connection between the electrical<br>
equipment and the incoming/outgoing of the power supply. After inserting the<br><br>
HT conductor (06) through the bushing (01) the lock nuts (07) are tightened at<br>
either end and securely fitted. This unique arrangement arrests any movement<br>
of the copper conductor (06) during service. Since the HT conductor (06) is not<br>
an integral part of the bushing (14), this arrangement facilitates easy assembly,<br>
maintenance and replacement.<br>
The process of manufacturing the terminal bushing (14) incorporated with the<br>
unique design features described herein above using the described composition<br>
of material, results in a new bushing capable of meeting the requirement of<br>
withstanding higher voltage rating as well as higher fault currents of electrical<br>
appliances.<br>
Manufacturing process of the terminal Bushing<br>
The epoxy based terminal bushing consists of Bisphenol 'A' epoxy resin,<br>
carboxylic acid anhydride and silica powder. The composition and process are<br>
described below:<br>
Composition of epoxy system :<br>
SI. No. Material	Parts by weight<br>
1.	Solvent free bisphenol A epoxy resin	100<br>
2.	Carboxylic acid anhydride	100<br>
3.	Silica Powder (filler)	375<br>
Apart from the above raw materials, hardware like brass tube, perforated brass<br>
sheet of ellipse profile and brass studs, which are welded to brass sheet are also<br>
employed in processing these bushings. A current carrying brass/copper rod with<br>
suitable fasteners are used in the assembly of a terminal bushing.<br><br>
Bisphenol A epoxy resin and the filler silica powder are thoroughly mixed for 8<br>
hours in a chamber maintained under vacuum of 5 Torr and at a temperature of<br>
about 65°c. Hardner, carbolic acid anhydride is kept in another chamber<br>
maintained at the same conditions. The operation of maintaining the vacuum<br>
and temperature in both the chambers for 8 hours is necessary to remove any<br>
dissolved gasses present in the materials. After this operation, both the filler<br>
mixed resin and the hardener are blended together by using a mechanical stirrer<br>
to get homogenous compound.<br>
For moulding this homogenous compound into the bushing, a mild steel die is<br>
fabricated to the required dimensions of the bushing. The brass tube described<br>
above is arranged at the center of the mild steel die. Knurling being made on the<br>
outer surface of the brass tube to enhance the mechanical bonding between the<br>
brass tube and the epoxy compound. Brass sheet is profiled into the ellipse<br>
shape and is also placed at the center of the mould. The brass sheet with<br>
diamond knurling and perforations is provided as a collar support to the bushing<br>
for better mechanical strength. The homogenous resin mix, which will be in<br>
semi-solid state is pumped into the mould under a pressure of 3 atmospheres.<br>
The temperature of the mould is maintained at about 140°c. Under these<br>
conditions, the epoxy mix is kept in the mould for 3 hours for curing. The cured<br>
bushing is then removed from the mould and kept in an air-circulating oven for 8<br>
hours at 130C for post curing. The post curing helps in cohesive bonding of the<br>
resin and the hardener system, thereby resulting in improved mechanical<br>
strength. A brass / copper rod is inserted through the brass tube to serve as an<br>
electrical connection. Necessary locking nuts and fasteners are provided to the<br>
brass / copper rod for connecting bushing to other electric equipment.<br>
The terminal bushing with the following exemplary technical specifications can be<br>
developed by using the above design features:<br><br><br>
Rating	:	11kV<br>
Proof voltage	:	28kV<br>
Lightning Impulse Volatge	:	70kV<br>
