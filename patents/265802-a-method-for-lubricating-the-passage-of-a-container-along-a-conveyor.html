SILICONE LUBRICANT WITH GOOD WETTING ON PET SURFACES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to conveyor lubricants and to a method for conveying<br>
articles. The invention also relates to conveyor systems and containers wholly or<br>
5 partially coated with such lubricant compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In commercial container filling or packaging operations, the containers<br>
typically are moved by a conveying system at very high rates of speed. Dilute<br>
aqueous lubricant compositions are typically applied to the conveyor or containers<br>
U) using spray or pumping equipment. These lubricant compositions permit high-speed<br>
operation of the conveyor and limit marring of the containers or labels. One problem<br>
that can occur with thermoplastic beverage containers made from polyethylene<br>
icrcphthalatc (PET) is environmental stress cracking. Stress cracking in polymers is<br>
the- development of cracks normal to an applied stress as a result of stress promoted<br>
1.1 chemical degradation. Typically amorphous polymers are more susceptible to stress<br>
cracking. In the case of PET, it is the amorphous regions of a beverage container<br>
such as the center of the base of a PET bottle that are most susceptible to stress<br>
cracking. When stress cracks penetrate through the wall of a PET bottle, the bottle<br>
fails either by leaking or bursting. Because of environmental stress cracking, bottles<br>
?.o filled with carbonated drinks are at risk for failure, especially at elevated<br>
temperatures (e.g., warmer weather, elevated storage temperatures, etc.). The risk of<br>
environmental stress cracking is exacerbated by the presence of materials which are<br>
incompatible with PET. Materials that, when in contact with PET increase the rate<br>
of occurrence of environmental stress cracking are considered incompatible with<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
PET while materials that result in no increase in environmental stress cracking are<br>
considered compatible with PET. The failure rate of PET bottles is greater for<br>
bottles that have been contacted with alkaline water than for bottles that have been<br>
contacted with deionized water, thus it can be stated that the presence of alkalinity<br>
decreases the compatibility of aqueous compositions with PET bottles.<br>
It is often the case that water used in the preparation of conveyor lubricant<br>
compositions contains alkalinity. For example, the alkalinity of water used for<br>
dilution of conveyor lubricants in bottling plants typically ranges between about 10<br>
ppm and 100 ppm, expressed as ppm of CaCOs (calcium carbonate), with occasional<br>
values above 100 ppm. According to the International Society of Beverage<br>
Technologists web site, it is strongly recommended to keep the total alkalinity level<br>
(expressed as CaCOg) below 50 mg/L (equivalent to 50 ppm as CaC03) in the water<br>
used to dilute lubricant concentrate compositions (lube make up water) in order to<br>
minimize the risk of stress crack failure. It is therefore important for conveyor<br>
lubricant compositions to show good compatibility with PET beverage bottles in the<br>
case that the dilution water contains alkalinity, particularly in the case that the<br>
dilution water exhibits alkalinity levels above 50 ppm and up to and in excess of 100<br>
ppm, measured as CaC03.<br>
Silicone based lubricants are preferred lubricants for PET bottles because<br>
they provide improved lubrication properties and significantly increased conveyor<br>
efficiency. Silicone containing lubricant compositions are described, for example in<br>
US Patent 6,495,494 (Li et. al) which is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety. However, aqueous silicone based lubricants may be considered to be less<br>
compatible with PET than other types of lubricants such as phosphate ester based<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/IIS2006/023299<br>
lubricants. For example, conventional aqueous silicone lubricant compositions<br>
generally show a relatively higher incidence of stress cracking under conditions of<br>
high alkalinity. There has therefore been an unmet need in the field of conveyor<br>
lubrication which is an aqueous silicone conveyor lubricant that exhibits good<br>
compatibility with PET, particularly in the case that the lubricant contains alkalinity,<br>
for example from the dilution water.<br>
It is against this background that the present invention has been made.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that a silicone based lubricant with<br>
improved wetting characteristics increases the compatibility of the silicone based<br>
lubricant with PET. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a<br>
method for lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor comprising<br>
applying a composition of a water-miscible silicone material to at least a portion of<br>
the container contacting surface of the conveyor or to at least a portion of the<br>
conveyor-contacting surface of the container, wherein the contact angle between the<br>
lubricant composition and container is less than about 60 degrees. The present<br>
invention provides, in another aspect, a method for lubricating the passage of a<br>
container along a conveyor comprising applying a composition of a water-miscible<br>
silicone material to at least a portion of the container contacting surface of the<br>
conveyor or to at least a portion of the conveyor-contacting surface of the container,<br>
wherein the lubricant forms a substantially contiguous coating which covers greater<br>
than about 30% of the surface when coated and dried onto polyethylene<br>
let ephthalate film with a wet coating thickness of about 14 microns. The present<br>
invention provides, in another aspect, a method for lubricating the passage of a<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
container along a conveyor comprising applying a composition of a water-miscible<br>
silicone material to at least a portion of the container contacting surface of the<br>
conveyor or to at least a portion of the conveyor-contacting surface of the container,<br>
wherein the lubricant composition has a foam profile of greater than about 1.1. The<br>
invention also provides conveyor lubricant compositions comprising a water-<br>
miscible silicone material and a wetting agent present in an amount effective to<br>
provide a contact angle of less than 60 degrees between the lubricant composition<br>
and a container surface. The present invention provides, in another aspect, a<br>
lubricant concentrate composition comprising a water-miscible silicone material and<br>
a wetting agent present in an amount effective to provide a contact angle of less than<br>
60 degrees between the diluted lubricant composition and a container surface when<br>
one part of the lubricant concentrate is diluted with between 100 and 1000 parts of<br>
water and/or hydrophilic diluent. These and other aspects of this invention will be<br>
evident upon reference to the following detailed description of the invention.<br>

Compositions<br>
The invention provides a lubricant coating that reduces the coefficient of<br>
friction of coated conveyor parts and containers and thereby facilitates movement of<br>
containers along a conveyor line. The present invention provides in one aspect, a<br>
method for<br>
lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor comprising applying a<br>
composition of a watcr-miscible silicone material to at least a portion of the<br>
container contacting surface of the conveyor or to at least a portion of the conveyor-<br>
contacting surface of the container, wherein the composition exhibits good wetting<br>
to PET. Typically lubricant compositions according to the present invention will<br>
contain in addition to the water-miscible silicone material an agent or agents for the<br>
improvement of the wetting of the composition to PET. Lubricant compositions of<br>
the present invention may also include, in addition to silicone and wetting agents,<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
waler-miscible lubricants that do not significantly improve the wetting of the<br>
lubricant to PET.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the "compatibility" with PET of<br>
conveyor<br>
lubricant compositions containing silicone can be significantly improved by<br>
improving the wetting of the lubricant composition to the PET surface. That is, PET<br>
beverage bottles which have been contacted with a silicone conveyor lubricant<br>
composition which has good wetting to PET show a lower bottle failure rate upon<br>
storage in a hot and humid environment than a similar silicone conveyor lubricant<br>
composition which has poor wetting to PET. Prior art silicone conveyor lubricant<br>
compositions exhibit poor wetting on PET surfaces. The use of these products in the<br>
situation of alkalinity and high temperature and humidity poses a risk for<br>
environmental stress cracking of PET bottles.<br>
The wetting behavior of lubricant compositions can be observed by<br>
preparing a coating of the lubricant composition onto PET film. By this method, a<br>
puddle of lubricant composition is spread across the film surface using a wire wound<br>
bar in an action that is referred to as "drawing down" or "handspreading." The<br>
thickness of the wet coating prepared by hand spreading is determined by the gauge<br>
thickness of the wire wound on the bar. As the thickness of the wire increases, so do<br>
the sizes of gaps between wire wraps and so does the thickness of the resulting<br>
coating. For example, a bar wrapped with 150 micron diameter wire will deposit a<br>
coating approximately 14 microns thick and a bar wrapped with 300 micron<br>
diameter wire will deposit a coating approximately 27 microns thick under similar<br>
conditions. Once the coating has been prepared by handspreading, the stability of the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
coating is dependent upon the wetting behavior. Coating compositions that have<br>
poor wetting are observed to de-wet the surface instantly, beading up to give isolated<br>
droplets of the coating composition. Coating compositions that have good wetting<br>
remain as contiguous, substantially uninterrupted films without showing a tendency<br>
to de-wet the surface or to bead up. Coating compositions that have intermediate<br>
wetting properties typically give contiguous films which may have imperfections<br>
including dc- wet spots and areas of non-uniform thickness.<br>
The wetting behavior of lubricant compositions can be quantified by<br>
measuring the contact angle of the lubricant composition with PET. It is well known<br>
to characterize the wetting behavior of liquids on solids by measuring the contact<br>
angle.<br>
The lower the contact angle between a liquid and a solid, the better a liquid<br>
will wet the surface of the solid. The contact angle 9 of a liquid on a solid is<br>
dependent upon the solid-liquid interfacial tension YSL, the solid-vapor interfacial<br>
tension YSV ("surface energy of solid"), and the liquid-vapor interfacial tension YLV<br>
("surface tension of a liquid") by the well known Young's equation:<br>
COSO-'(YSV-YSL)/YLV<br>
The contact angle is smaller as cos G increases. Therefore from Young's<br>
equation best wetting is achieved by making YSL and YLV as small as possible. This<br>
can be accomplished by use of wetting agents. For the special case of conveyor<br>
lubricant compatibility with polyethylene terephthalate, Ysv is a property of<br>
polyethylene terephthalate and is not changeable by modifying the properties of the<br>
lubricant composition. It might be thought that it is effective merely to achieve a<br>
much lower the surface tension (YLV) of the lubricant composition, and that addition<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
of any surfactant that is capable to lower the surface tension would be sufficient to<br>
improve the wetting of the lubricant composition to the polymer surface. Actually it<br>
is equally if not more important that the wetting agent lower the interfacial energy<br>
between the polymer surface and the liquid lubricant composition (ysi,)- Lowering<br>
the interfacial energy between the polyethylene terephthalate surface and the liquid<br>
lubricant composition may also diminish the reactivity of the polymer with water in<br>
the hydrolysis reaction, and increase the degree of crazing. According to Volynskii<br>
(Volynskii, A. L., &amp; Bakeev, N. F. (1995). Solvent Crazing of Polymers, Studies in<br>
Polymer Science 13. New York, NY: Elsevier), solvent crazing of polymers under<br>
stress results from suppression of the coagulation of oriented polymer fibrils due to<br>
the presence of surface active liquid environments. The surface activity of the liquid<br>
environment increases as ysi, decreases. Whether for the benefit of improving the<br>
wetting and the areal coverage of the lubricant composition as it dries, increasing the<br>
surface activity of the lubricant composition with respect to the polymer surface, or<br>
to promote crazing, it is believed important to select wetting agents on the basis of<br>
lowering the contact angle between the lubricant composition and the polymer<br>
surface rather than simply on the basis of lowering the surface tension of the liquid<br>
lubricant composition.<br>
The contact angle is typically measured by recording an image of a test<br>
liquid on the surface of the test solid, then measuring the intersecting angle between<br>
the liquid-air interface and the liquid-solid interface.<br>
While we do not wish to be bound by theory, there are several possible<br>
explanations for why improving the wetting of silicone lubricants improves the<br>
compatibility with PET. The simplest explanation is that by preventing the lubricant<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
composition from beading up, the feature of good wetting is preventing the<br>
concentration of alkaline residue, for example in water spots. By distributing<br>
alkaline compounds evenly across the bottle, the better wetting lubricant<br>
compositions are preventing localized attack of concentrated alkaline species.<br>
Another possible reason for the lowering of burst rates with better wetting<br>
lubricant compositions is that surface active agents in the lubricant stabilize the<br>
polymer against chemical attack. When filled bottles expand under pressure in a<br>
process commonly referred to as "creep," virgin, previously unexposed polymer<br>
surface is created. By stabilizing the newly generated surface area, the reaction of<br>
the polymer in those areas with water in the ester hydrolysis reaction may be<br>
reduced.<br>
The lowering of burst rates may also be related to the development of<br>
microscopic crazes on the surface of the bottle. Typically, as the wetting behavior of<br>
lubricants on PET improves, the amount of crazing increases. The presence of crazes<br>
in the amorphous PET regions of the bottle may mitigate macroscopic cracking and<br>
failure by either dissipating the attack of alkaline hydrolysis or by making more<br>
tortuous the path of a propagating crack tip. When tested on carbonated beverage<br>
bottles in a stress test at 100 F and 85% relative humidity, inventive lubricant<br>
compositions showed relatively more crazing than either deionized water or<br>
comparative example formulations. Using a visual crazing test where bottles with<br>
no visible signs of crazing are scored 0 and bottles with pronounced crazing are<br>
scored 10, lubricant compositions of the present invention typically gave crazing<br>
values above about 4, compared to water and comparative example compositions<br>
which gave crazing values less than about 4.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, the present invention has been observed to<br>
reduce stress cracking in PET bottles when compared to prior art compositions,<br>
based on the wetting properties of the invention. The wetting properties can be<br>
measured in a variety of ways including contact angle and by coating the<br>
compositions onto PET sheets. The contact angles of compositions of the present<br>
invention with PET are generally below about 60 degrees, while the contact angles<br>
of prior art and comparative compositions are above 60 degrees. Accordingly,<br>
compositions of the present invention having improved wetting properties have<br>
contact angles below about 60 degrees, below about 50 degrees, or below about 40<br>
degrees. When coated as a thin film onto PET sheets and dried, inventive lubricant<br>
compositions cover greater than about 30% of the PET surface area that was<br>
originally wetted in the coating process, while prior art and comparative examples<br>
generally cover less than 10% of the originally wetted surface. Accordingly, when<br>
coated as a thin film onto PET sheets and dried, compositions of the present<br>
invention cover greater than about 30%, greater than about 50%, or greater than<br>
about 70% of the PET surface area that was originally wetted in the coating process.<br>
Inventive lubricant compositions also give relatively more foam than either<br>
dcionized water or comparative example formulations. Using a foam profile test<br>
where the foam profile measured 60 seconds after ten inversions of a graduated<br>
cylinder is the ratio of the volume of liquid plus foam to liquid originally present,<br>
inventive compositions gave foam profile values greater than about 1.1 compared to<br>
prior art and comparative example compositions which generally gave foam profile<br>
values less than 1.1. Accordingly, when evaluated using a foam profile test where<br>
the foam profile measured 60 seconds after ten inversions of a graduated cylinder is<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2(107/04(1677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
the ratio of the volume of liquid, compositions of the present invention give foam<br>
profile values greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.3, or greater than about<br>
Lubricant compositions of the present invention comprise wetting agents in<br>
amounts sufficient to impart good wetting properties of the composition to PET.<br>
Accordingly, compositions of the present invention have greater than about 0.01 wt.<br>
% of wetting agent, greater than about 0.02 wt. % wetting agent, or greater than<br>
about 0.04 wt. % wetting agent.<br>
It may be desirable to provide compositions of the present invention in the<br>
form of concentrates that can be diluted with water at the point of use to give use<br>
compositions. Inventive lubricant concentrate compositions comprise a water-<br>
miscible silicone material and a wetting agent present in an amount effective to<br>
provide a contact angle of less than 60 degrees between the diluted lubricant<br>
composition and a container surface when one part of the lubricant concentrate is<br>
diluted with between 100 and 1000 parts of water plus hydrophilic diluent.<br>
Accordingly, lubricant concentrate compositions comprise greater than about 1.0 wt.<br>
% of wetting agent, greater than about 2.0 wt. % wetting agent, or greater than about<br>
4.0 wt. % wetting agent.<br>
The wetting behavior of lubricants is relevant to the lubricant as it is applied,<br>
cither to the PET bottle directly or to any other surface where it may come in contact<br>
with PET bottles, including the conveyor belt. This includes lubricants which consist<br>
of a lubricant concentrate that is diluted with water at the point of use in any ratio of<br>
lubricant concentrate to water, and it includes lubricants which are applied without<br>
dilution.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
The silicone material and wetting agents are "water-miscible", that is, they<br>
arc sufficiently water-soluble or water-dispersible so that when added to water at the<br>
desired use level they form a stable solution, emulsion, or suspension. The desired<br>
use level will vary according to the particular conveyor or container application, and<br>
according to the type of silicone and wetting agent employed.<br>
A variety of water-miscible silicone materials can be employed in the<br>
lubricant compositions, including one or more of the group consisting of silicone<br>
emulsions (such as emulsions formed from methyl(dimethyl), higher alkyl and aryl<br>
silicones; and functionalized silicones such as chlorosilanes; amino-, methoxy-,<br>
epoxy- and vinyl-substituted siloxanes; and silanols). Suitable silicone emulsions<br>
include E2175 high viscosity polydimethylsiloxane (a 60% siloxane emulsion<br>
commercially available from Lambent Technologies, Inc.), E2140<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (a 35% siloxane emulsion commercially available from<br>
! .arnbcnt Technologies, Inc.), E21456 FG food grade intermediate viscosity<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (a 35% siloxane emulsion commercially available from<br>
Lambent Technologies, Inc.), HV490 high molecular weight hydroxy-terminated<br>
dimethyl silicone (an anionic 30-60% siloxane emulsion commercially available<br>
from Dow Coming Corporation), SM2135 polydimethylsiloxane (a nonionic 50%<br>
siloxane emulsion commercially available from GE Silicones) and SM2167<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (a cationic 50% siloxane emulsion commercially available<br>
from GE Silicones). Other water-miscible silicone materials include finely divided<br>
silicone powders such as the TOSPEARL™ series (commercially available from<br>
Toshiba Silicone Co. Ltd.); and silicone surfactants such as SWP30 anionic silicone<br>
surfactant, WAXWS-P nonionic silicone surfactant, QUATQ-400M cationic<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
silicone surfactant and 703 specialty silicone surfactant (all commercially available<br>
from Lambent Technologies, Inc.).<br>
Polydimethylsiloxane emulsions are preferred silicone materials. Generally<br>
the concentration of the active silicone material useful in the present invention<br>
exclusive of any dispersing agents, water, diluents, or other ingredients used to<br>
emulsify the silicone material or otherwise make it miscible with water falls in the<br>
range of about 0.0005% to about 5.0%, about 0.001% to about 1.0%, or about<br>
0.002% to about 0.50%. In the case that the lubricant composition is provided in the<br>
form of a concentrate, the concentration of active silicone material useful in the<br>
present invention exclusive of any dispersing agents, water, diluents, or other<br>
ingredients used to emulsify the silicone material or otherwise make it miscible with<br>
water falls in the range of about 0.05% to about 20%, about 0.10% to about 5%, or<br>
about 0.2% to about 1.0%.<br>
As used herein, a wetting agent is a surface active agent or a mixture of one<br>
or more surface active agents that imparts good wetting when added to a lubricant<br>
composition. By good wetting it is meant the contact angle between the lubricant<br>
composition and PET is below about 60 degrees or increases the areal coverage of<br>
the lubricant concentration upon coating and drying on PET film is greater than<br>
about 30%&gt;. The wetting agent or wetting admixture of wetting agents of the present<br>
invention can be selected from water soluble or water dispersible nonionic, semi-<br>
polar nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric, or zwitterionic surface-active agents;<br>
or any combination thereof. The particular surfactant or surfactant mixture chosen<br>
tor use in the process and products of this invention can depend on the conditions of<br>

Generally, the concentration of wetting agent or wetting agent mixture useful<br>
in lubricant use compositions of the present invention fall in the range of from about<br>
0.01.% to about 0.5 wt. % of the wetting agent or agents, by weight of the<br>
composition, about 0.02% to about 0.30 wt. % of the wetting agent, or about 0.04%<br>
to about 0.15 wt. % of the wetting agent. These percentages can refer to percentages<br>
of the commercially available surfactant composition, which can contain solvents,<br>
dyes, odorants, and the like in addition to the actual surfactant. In this case, the<br>
percentage of the actual surfactant chemical can be less than the percentages listed.<br>
These percentages can refer to the percentage of the actual surfactant chemical. In<br>
the case that the lubricant composition is provided in the form of a concentrate, the<br>
concentration of wetting agent or wetting agent mixture useful in the concentrate<br>
compositions of the present invention fall in the range of from about 1 % to about<br>
50% of the wetting agent or agents, by weight of the composition, about 2% to about<br>
30% of the wetting agent, or about 4% to about 20 wt. % of the wetting agent.<br>
Nonionic Surfactant Wetting Agents<br>
Nonionic surfactant wetting agents useful in the invention are generally<br>
characterized by the presence of an organic hydrophobic group and an organic<br>
hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic<br>
aliphatic, alkyl aromatic or polyoxyalkylene hydrophobic compound with a<br>
hydrophilic alkaline oxide moiety which in common practice is ethylene oxide or a<br>
polyhydration product thereof, polyethylene glycol. Practically any hydrophobic<br>
compound having a hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, or amido group with a reactive<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
hydrogen atom can be condensed with ethylene oxide, or its polyhydration adducts,<br>
or its compositions with alkoxylenes such as propylene oxide to form a nonionic<br>
surface-active agent. The length of the hydrophilic polyoxyalkylene moiety which<br>
is condensed with any particular hydrophobic compound can be readily adjusted to<br>
yield a water dispersible or water soluble compound having the desired degree of<br>
balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Useful nonionic<br>
surfactants in the present invention include:<br>
1.	Block polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene polymeric compounds<br>
based upon propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, and<br>
ethylenediamine as the initiator reactive hydrogen compound. Examples of<br>
polymeric compounds made from a sequential propoxylation and ethoxylation of<br>
initiator are commercially available under the trade names Pluronic® and Tetronic®<br>
manufactured by BASF Corp.<br>
Pluronic® compounds are difunctional (two reactive hydrogens) compounds<br>
formed by condensing ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base formed by the<br>
addition of propylene oxide to the two hydroxyl groups of propylene glycol. This<br>
hydrophobic portion of the molecule weighs from about 1,000 to about 4,000.<br>
Ethylene oxide is then added to sandwich this hydrophobe between hydrophilic<br>
groups, controlled by length to constitute from about 10% by weight to about 80%<br>
by weight of the final molecule.<br>
Tetronic® compounds are tetra-functional block copolymers derived from the<br>
sequential addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to ethylenediamine. The<br>
molecular weight of the propylene oxide hydrotype ranges from about 500 to about<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCMJS2006/023299<br>
7,000; and, the hydrophile, ethylene oxide, is added to constitute from about 10% by<br>
weight to about 80% by weight of the molecule.<br>
2.	Condensation products of one mole of alkyl phenol wherein the alkyl<br>
chain, of straight chain or branched chain configuration, or of single or dual alkyl<br>
constituent, contains from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms with from about 3 to<br>
about 50 moles of ethylene oxide. The alkyl group can, for example, be represented<br>
by diisobutylene, di-amyl, polymerized propylene, iso-octyl, nonyl, and di-nonyl.<br>
These surfactants can be polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene oxide<br>
condensates of alkyl phenols. Examples of commercial compounds of this<br>
chemistry are available on the market under the trade names Igepal® manufactured<br>
by Hhone-Poulenc and Triton® manufactured by Union Carbide.<br>
3.	Condensation products of one mole of a saturated or unsaturated,<br>
straight or branched chain alcohol having from about 6 to about 24 carbon atoms<br>
with from about 3 to about 50 moles of ethylene oxide. The alcohol moiety can<br>
consist<of mixtures of alcohols in the above delineated carbon range or it can consist></of>
of an alcohol having a specific number of carbon atoms within this range. Examples<br>
of like commercial surfactant are available under the trade names Neodol®<br>
manufactured by Shell Chemical Co. and Alfonic® manufactured by Vista Chemical<br>
Co.<br>
4.	Condensation products of one mole of saturated or unsaturated,<br>
straight or branched chain carboxylic acid having from about 8 to about 18 carbon<br>
atoms with from about 6 to about 50 moles of ethylene oxide. The acid moiety can<br>
consist of mixtures of acids in the above defined carbon atoms range or it can consist<br>
of an acid having a specific number of carbon atoms within the range. Examples of<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
commercial compounds of this chemistry are available on the market under the trade<br>
names Nopalcol® manufactured by Henkel Corporation and Lipopeg® manufactured<br>
by Lipo Chemicals, Inc.<br>
In addition to ethoxylated carboxylic acids, commonly called polyethylene<br>
glycol esters, other alkanoic acid esters formed by reaction with glycerides, glycerin,<br>
and polyhydric (saccharide or sorbitan/sorbitol) alcohols have application in this<br>
invention for specialized embodiments, particularly indirect food additive<br>
applications. All of these ester moieties have one or more reactive hydrogen sites on<br>
their molecule which can undergo further acylation or ethylene oxide (alkoxide)<br>
addition to control the hydrophilicity of these substances.<br>
Examples of nonionic low foaming surfactants include:<br>
5.	Compounds from (1) which are modified, essentially reversed, by<br>
adding ethylene oxide to ethylene glycol to provide a hydrophile of designated<br>
molecular weight; and, then adding propylene oxide to obtain hydrophobic blocks<br>
on the outside (ends) of the molecule. The hydrophobic portion of the molecule<br>
weighs from about 1,000 to about 3,100 with the central hydrophile including 10%<br>
by weight to about 80% by weight of the final molecule. These reverse Pluronics®<br>
arc manufactured by BASF Corporation under the trade name Pluronic® R<br>
surfactants.<br>
Likewise, the Tetronic® R surfactants are produced by BASF Corporation by<br>
the sequential addition of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to ethylenediamine.<br>
The hydrophobic portion of the molecule weighs from about 2,100 to about 6,700<br>
with the central hydrophile including 10% by weight to 80% by weight of the final<br>
molecule.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
6.	Compounds from groups (1), (2), (3) and (4) which are modified by<br>
"capping" or "end blocking" the terminal hydroxy group or groups (of multi-<br>
functional moieties) to reduce foaming by reaction with a small hydrophobic<br>
molecule such as propylene oxide, butylene oxide, benzyl chloride; and, short chain<br>
fatty acids, alcohols or alkyl halides containing from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms; and<br>
mixtures thereof. Also included arc reactants such as thionyl chloride which convert<br>
terminal hydroxy groups to a chloride group. Such modifications to the terminal<br>
hydroxy group may lead to all-block, block-heteric, heteric-block or all-heteric<br>
nonionics.<br>
Additional examples of effective low foaming nonionics include:<br>

The treatise Nonionic Surfactants, edited by Schick, M.J., Vol. 1 of the<br>
Surfactant Science Series, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1983 is an excellent<br>
reference on the wide variety of nonionic compounds generally employed in the<br>
practice of the present invention. A typical listing of nonionic classes, and species<br>
of these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and<br>

Semi-Polar Nonionic Surfactant Wetting Agents<br>
The semi-polar type of nonionic surface active agents are another class of<br>
nonionic surfactant useful in compositions of the present invention. Generally,<br>
semi-polar nonionics are high foamers and foam stabilizers, which can limit their<br>
application in conveyor lubricant compositions. However, within compositional<br>
embodiments of this invention designed for high foam applications, semi-polar<br>
nonionics would have immediate utility. The semi-polar nonionic surfactants<br>
include the amine oxides, phosphine oxides, sulfoxides and their alkoxylated<br>
derivatives.<br>
14. Amine oxides are tertiary amine oxides corresponding to the general<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R1, R2,<br>
and R" may be aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, alicyclic, or combinations thereof.<br>
Generally, for amine oxides of detergent interest, R1 is an alkyl radical of from about<br>
8 to about 24 carbon atoms; R2and R3 are alkyl or hydroxyalkyl of 1-3 carbon atoms<br>
or a mixture thereof; R' and R can be attached to each other, e.g. through an oxygen<br>
or nitrogen atom, to form a ring structure; R4 is an alkaline or a hydroxyalkylene<br>
group containing 2 to 3 carbon atoms; and n ranges from 0 to about 20.<br>
Useful water soluble amine oxide surfactants are selected from the coconut<br>
or tallow alkyl di-(lower alkyl) amine oxides, specific examples of which are<br>
dodecyldimethylamine oxide, tridecyldimethylamine oxide,<br>
23<br><br>

tetradecyldibutylamine oxide, octadecyldibutylamine oxide, bis(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)dodecylamine oxide, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-dodecoxy-l-<br>
hydroxypropylamine oxide, dimethyl-(2-hydroxydodecyl)amine oxide, 3,6,9-<br>
trioctadecyldimethylamine oxide and 3-dodecoxy-2-hydroxypropyldi-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)amine oxide.<br>
Useful semi-polar nonionic surfactants also include the water soluble<br>
phosphine oxides having the following structure:<br><br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R1 is<br>
an alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety ranging from 10 to about 24 carbon atoms<br>
in chain length; and, R2 and R3 are each alkyl moieties separately selected from alkyl<br>
or hydroxyalkyl groups containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of useful phosphine oxides include dimethyldecylphosphine oxide,<br>
dimethyltetradecylphosphine oxide, methylethyltetradecylphosphine oxide,<br>
dimethylhexadccylphosphine oxide, diethyl-2-hydroxyoctyldecylphosphine oxide,<br>
biK(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecylphosphine oxide, and<br>
bis(hydroxyrnethyl)tetradecylphosphine oxide.	Semi-polar nonionic surfactants<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCMJS2006/023299<br>
useful herein also include the water soluble sulfoxide compounds which have the<br>
structure:<br><br>
wherein the arrow is a conventional representation of a semi-polar bond; and, R is<br>
an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety of about 8 to about 28 carbon atoms, from 0 to<br>
about 5 ether linkages and from 0 to about 2 hydroxyl substituents; and R is an<br>
alkyl moiety consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
Useful examples of these sulfoxides include dodecyl methyl sulfoxide; 3-<br>
hydroxy tridecyl methyl sulfoxide; 3-methoxy tridecyl methyl sulfoxide; and 3-<br>
hydroxy-4-dodecoxybutyl methyl sulfoxide.<br>
Preferred semi-polar nonionic surfactants for the compositions of the<br>
invention include dimethyl amine oxides, such as lauryl dimethyl amine oxide,<br>
myristyl dimethyl amine oxide, cetyl dimethyl amine oxide, combinations thereof,<br>
and the like.<br>
Anionic Surfactant Wetting Agents<br>
Also useful in the present invention are surface active substances which are<br>
categorized as anionics because the charge on the hydrophobe is negative.<br>
Carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate and phosphate are the polar (hydrophilic) solubilizing<br>
groups found in anionic surfactants. Preferred anionic surfactant wetting agents are<br>
those in which the hydrophobic section of the molecule carries a charge at pH values<br>
at neutrality or below, less preferred are those in which the hydrophobic section of<br>
25<br><br>
WO 20(17/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
the molecule carries no charge unless the pH is elevated to neutrality or above (e.g.<br>
carboxylic acids). Of the cations (counter ions) associated with these polar groups,<br>
sodium, lithium and potassium impart water solubility; ammonium and substituted<br>
ammonium ions provide both water and oil solubility; and, calcium, barium, and<br>
magnesium promote oil solubility.<br>
As those skilled in the art understand, anionics are excellent detersive<br>
surfactants and are therefore, favored additions to give lubricant compositions which<br>
provide improved detergency. Generally, however, anionics have high foam profiles<br>
which limit their use alone or at high concentration levels in conveyor lubricants<br>
where low foam profiles are preferred. Anionics are very useful additives to<br>
preferred compositions of the present invention. Further, anionic surface active<br>
compounds are useful to impart special chemical or physical properties other than<br>
detergency within the composition. Anionics can be employed as gelling agents or<br>
as part of a gelling or thickening system. Anionics are excellent solubilizers and can<br>
be used for hydrotropic effect and cloud point control.<br>
The majority of large volume commercial anionic surfactants can be<br>
subdivided into five major chemical classes and additional sub-groups known to<br>
those of skill in the art and described in "Surfactant Encyclopedia", Cosmetics &amp;<br>
Toiletries, Vol. 104 (2) 71-86 (1989). The first class includes acylamino acids (and<br>
salts), such as acylgluamates, acyl peptides, sarcosinates (e.g. N-acyl sarcosinates),<br>
taurates (e.g. N-acyl taurates and fatty acid amides of methyl tauride), and the like.<br>
The second class includes carboxylic acids (and salts), such as alkanoic acids (and<br>
alkanoates), ester carboxylic acids (e.g. alkyl succinates), ether carboxylic acids, and<br>
the like. The third class includes phosphoric acid esters and their salts. The fourth<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
class includes sulfonic acids (and salts), such as isethionates (e.g. acyl isethionates),<br>
alkylaryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, sulfosuccinates (e.g. monoesters and diesters<br>
of sulfosuccinate), and the like. The fifth class includes sulfuric acid esters (and<br>
salts), such as alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl sulfates, and the like.<br>
Anionic sulfate surfactants suitable for use in the present compositions<br>
include the linear and branched primary and secondary alkyl sulfates, alkyl<br>
cthoxysulfates, fatty oleyl glycerol sulfates, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether<br>
sulfates, the C5 -Cn acyl-N-(C] -C4 alkyl) and -N-(Ci -C2 hydroxyalkyl) glucamine<br>
sulfates, and sulfates of alkylpolysaccharides such as the sulfates of<br>
alkylpolyglucoside (the nonionic nonsulfated compounds being described herein).<br>
Examples of suitable synthetic, water soluble anionic surfactant compounds<br>
include the ammonium and substituted ammonium (such as mono-, di- and<br>
triethanolamine) and alkali metal (such as sodium, lithium and potassium) salts of<br>
the alkyl mononuclear aromatic sulfonates such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates<br>
containing from about 5 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group in a straight or<br>
branched chain, e.g., the salts of alkyl benzene sulfonates or of alkyl toluene, xylene,<br>
cumene and phenol sulfonates; alkyl naphthalene sulfonate, diamyl naphthalene<br>
sulfonate, and dinonyl naphthalene sulfonate and alkoxylated derivatives.<br>
Other anionic surfactants suitable for use in the present compositions include<br>
olefin sulfonates, such as long chain alkene sulfonates, long chain hydroxyalkane<br>
sulfonates or mixtures of alkenesulfonates and hydroxyalkane-sulfonates. Also<br>
included are the alkyl sulfates, alkyl poly(ethyleneoxy) ether sulfates and aromatic<br>
poly(ethyleneoxy) sulfates such as the sulfates or condensation products of ethylene<br>
oxide and nonyl phenol (usually having 1 to 6 oxyethylene groups per molecule.<br>
27<br><br>

Resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids are also suitable, such as rosin,<br>
hydrogenated rosin, and resin acids and hydrogenated resin acids present in or<br>
derived from tallow oil.<br>
The particular salts will be suitably selected depending upon the particular<br>
formulation and the needs therein.<br>
Further examples of suitable anionic surfactants are given in "Surface Active<br>
Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch). A variety of<br>
such surfactants are also generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678, issued Dec.<br>
30, 1975 to Laughlin, et al. at Column 23, line 58 through Column 29, line 23.<br>
Care should be taken to avoid the use of wetting agents that might promote<br>
environmental stress cracking in plastic containers when evaluated using the PET<br>
Stress Crack Test set out below. The tendency of wetting agents to promote<br>
environmental stress cracking can be evaluated using the PET Stress Crack Test set<br>
out below. Examples of preferred wetting agents include fatty amines, alcohol<br>
ethoxylates and mixtures thereof. Examples of particularly preferred lubricant use<br>
compositions include those having from about 0.001 wt. % to about 0.02 wt. % of a<br>
water-misciblc silicone material from about 0.01 wt. % to about 0.05 wt. % of a fatty<br>
amine compound, and from about 0.02 wt. % to about 0.10 wt. % of an alcohol<br>
ethoxylate compound. Examples of particularly preferred lubricant concentrate<br>
compositions include those having from about 0.10 wt. % to about 2 wt. % of a<br>
water-miscible silicone material from about 1.0 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of fatty<br>
amine compound, and from about 2 wt. % to about 40 wt. % of an alcohol<br>
eihoxylate compound. Particularly preferred lubricant compositions are<br>
substantially aqueous, that is, they comprise greater than about 99 wt. % of water.<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2(1(17/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
Lubricant compositions of the present invention can be applied as is or may<br>
be diluted before use. It may be desirable to provide compositions of the present<br>
invention in the form of concentrates that can be diluted with water at the point of<br>
use to give use compositions. If diluted, preferred ratios for dilution at the point of<br>
use range from about 1:100 to 1:1000 (parts of concentrate: parts of water). In the<br>
case that lubricant compositions are provided in the form of concentrates, it is<br>
particularly preferred to select silicone materials and wetting agents that form stable<br>
compositions at 100 to 1000 times the concentration of the use composition.<br>
In the case that the silicone material is a silicone emulsion, the wetting agent<br>
or agents preferably are selected from those that will not cause the silicone emulsion<br>
to coagulate or separate, either in the use composition or in the concentrate if the<br>
composition is provided in the form of a concentrate.<br>
The lubricant compositions can contain functional ingredients if desired. For<br>
example, the compositions can contain hydrophilic diluents, antimicrobial agents,<br>
stabilizing/coupling agents, detergents and dispersing agents, anti-wear agents,<br>
viscosity modifiers, sequestrants, corrosion inhibitors, film forming materials,<br>
antioxidants or antistatic agents. The amounts and types of such additional<br>
components will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Water-miscible Lubricants<br>
A variety of water-miscible lubricants can be employed in the lubricant<br>
compositions, including hydroxy-containing compounds such as polyols (e.g.,<br>
glycerol and propylene glycol); polyalkylene glycols (e.g., the CARBOWAX™<br>
series of polyethylene and methoxypolyethylene glycols, commercially available<br>
from Union Carbide Corp.); linear copolymers of ethylene and propylene oxides<br>
29<br><br>
WO 20(17/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
(e.g., UCON™ 50-HB-100 water-soluble ethylene oxide:propylene oxide<br>
copolymer, commercially available from Union Carbide Corp.); and sorbitan esters<br>
(e.g., TWEEN™ series 20, 40, 60, 80 and 85 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleates<br>
and SPAN™ series 20, 80, 83 and 85 sorbitan esters, commercially available from<br>
ICT Surfactants). Other suitable water-miscible lubricants include phosphate esters,<br>
amines and their derivatives, and other commercially available water-miscible<br>
lubricants that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Derivatives (e.g., partial<br>
esters or ethoxylates) of the above lubricants can also be employed. For applications<br>
involving plastic containers, care should be taken to avoid the use of water-miscible<br>
lubricants that might promote environmental stress cracking in plastic containers<br>
when evaluated using the PET Stress Crack Test set out below. Preferably the water-<br>
miscible lubricant is a polyol such as glycerol or a linear copolymer of ethylene and<br>
propylene oxides.<br>
Hydrophilic Diluents<br>
Suitable hydrophilic diluents include alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol,<br>
polyols such as ethylene glycol and glycerine, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. For applications involving plastic<br>
containers, care should be taken to avoid the use of hydrophilic diluents that might<br>
promote environmental stress cracking in plastic containers when evaluated using<br>
the PET Stress Crack Test set out below.<br>
Antimicrobial Agents<br>
Anti-microbial agents can also be added. Some useful anti-microbial agents<br>
include disinfectants, antiseptics, and preservatives. Some non-limiting examples<br>
include phenols including halo- and nitrophenols and substituted bisphenols such as<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
4-hexylresorcinol, 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenol and 2,4,4'-trichloro-2-hydroxydiphenyl<br>
ether, organic and inorganic acids and its esters and salts such as dehydroacetic acid,<br>
peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyacetic acid, methyl p-hydroxy benzoic acid, cationic<br>
agents such as quaternary ammonium compound, phosphonium compounds such as<br>
tetrakishydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate (THPS), aldehydes such as<br>
glutaraldehyde, antimicrobial dyes such as acridines, triphenylmethane dyes and<br>
quinines and halogens including iodine and chlorine compounds. The antimicrobial<br>
agents can be used in amounts to provide the desired antimicrobial properties. In<br>
some examples, the amount can range from 0 to about 20 wt.-% of the total<br>
composition, hydrophilic<br>
Stabilizing/Coupling Agents<br>
In a lubricant concentrate, stabilizing agents, or coupling agents can be<br>
employed to keep the concentrate homogeneous, for example, under cold<br>
temperature. Some of the ingredients may have the tendency to phase separate or<br>
form layers due to the high concentration. Many different types of compounds can<br>
be used as stabilizers. Examples are isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, urea, octane<br>
sulfonate, glycols such as hexylene glycol, propylene glycol and the like. The<br>
stabilizing/coupling agents can be used in an amount to give desired results. This<br>
amount can range, for example, from about 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the total<br>
composition.<br>
Detergents/Dispersing Agents<br>
Detergents of dispersing agents may also be added. Some examples of<br>
detergents and dispersants include alkylbenzenesulfonic acid, alkylphenols,<br>
carboxylic acids, alkylphosphonic acids, and their calcium, sodium, and magnesium<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/IJS2006/023299<br>
salts, polybutenylsuccinic acid derivatives, silicone surfactants, fluorosurfactants,<br>
and molecules containing polar groups attached to an oil-solubilizing aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon chain.<br>
Some examples of suitable dispersing agents include triethanolamine,<br>
alkoxylated fatty alkyl monoamines and diamines such as coco bis (2-<br>
hydroxyethy])amine, polyoxyethylene(5-)coco amine, polyoxyethylene(15)coco<br>
amine, tallow bis(-2hydroxyethyl)amine, polyoxyethylene(15)amine,<br>
polyoxyethylenc(5)oleyl amine and the like.<br>
The detergent and/or dispersants can be used in an amount to give desired<br>
results. This amount can range, for example, from about 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the<br>
total composition.<br>
Anti-wear Agents<br>
Anti-wear agents can also be added. Some examples of anti-wear agents<br>
include zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates, tricresyl phosphate, and alkyl and aryl<br>
disulfides and polysulfides. The anti-wear and/or extreme pressure agents are used<br>
in amounts to give the desired results. This amount can range, for example, from 0<br>
to about 20 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>
Viscosity Modifiers<br>
Viscosity modifiers can also be used. Some examples of viscosity modifiers<br>
include pour-point depressants and viscosity improvers, such as polymethacrylates,<br>
polyisobutylcnes polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylic acids, high<br>
molecular weight polyoxyethylenes, and polyalkyl styrenes. The modifiers can be<br>
used in amounts to provide the desired results. In some embodiments, the viscosity<br>
modifiers can range for 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
Sequestrants<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, it is possible to include other<br>
chemicals in the lubricant concentrates. For example, where soft water is unavailable<br>
and hard water is used for the dilution of the lubricant concentrate, there is a<br>
tendency for the hardness cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and ferrous ions, to<br>
reduce the efficacy of the surfactants, and even form precipitates when coming into<br>
contact with ions such as sulfates, and carbonates. Sequestrants can be used to form<br>
complexes with the hardness ions. A sequestrant molecule may contain two or more<br>
donor atoms which are capable of forming coordinate bonds with a hardness ion.<br>
Sequestrants that possess three, four, or more donor atoms are called tridentate,<br>
tctradentate, or polydentate coordinators. Generally the compounds with the larger<br>
number of donor atoms are better sequestrants. The preferable sequestrant is<br>
ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (EDTA), such as Versene products which are<br>
Na2EDTA and Na^EDTA sold by Dow Chemicals. Some additional examples of<br>
other sequestrants include: iminodisuccinic acid sodium salt, trans-1,2-<br>
diaminocyclohexane tetracetic acid monohydrate, diethylene triamine pentacetic<br>
acid, sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid, pentasodium salt of N-hydroxyethylene<br>
diamine triacetic acid, trisodium salt of N,N-di(beta-hydroxyethyl)glycine, sodium<br>
salt of sodium glucoheptonate, and the like.<br>
Corrosion Inhibitors<br>
Useful corrosion inhibitors include polycarboxylic acids such as short chain<br>
carboxylic diacids, triacids, as well as phosphate esters and combinations thereof.<br>
Useful phosphate esters include alkyl phosphate esters, monoalkyl aryl phosphate<br>
esters, dialkyl aryl phosphate esters, trialkyl aryl phosphate esters, and mixtures<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
thereof such as Emphos PS 236 commercially available from Witco Chemical<br>
Company. Other useful corrosion inhibitors include the triazoles, such as<br>
benzotriazole, tolyltriazole and mercaptobenzothiazole, and in combinations with<br>
phosphonates such as 1-hydroxyethylidene-l, 1-diphosphonic acid, and surfactants<br>
such as oleic acid diethanolamide and sodium cocoamphohydroxy propyl sulfonate,<br>
and the like. Useful corrosion inhibitors include polycarboxylic acids such as<br>
dicarboxylic acids. The acids which are preferred include adipic, glutaric, succinic,<br>
and mixtures thereof. The most preferred is a mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic<br>
acid, which is a raw material sold by BASF under the name SOKALAN™ DCS.<br>
Preferred lubricant compositions may also contain a stoichiometric amount<br>
of an organic acid. Lubricant compositions that comprise a stoichiometric amount of<br>
an organic acid and have improved compatibility with PET are disclosed in<br>
assignee's copending patent application, titled SILICONE CONVEYOR<br>
LUBRICANT WITH STOICHIOMETRIC AMOUNT OF AN ORGANIC ACID,<br>
filed September 22, 2005 with attorney docket number 2264US01, which<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference. Compositions which comprise both a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid and wetting agent sufficient to lower the contact angle<br>
to less than about 60 degrees may exhibit a synergistic effect, that is, the overall<br>
reduction of the failure rate for PET bottles may be greater than the sum of the<br>
reduction of the failure rate for either a stoichiometric amount of acid or wetting<br>
agent alone.<br>
Preferred lubricant compositions may be foaming, that is, they may have a<br>
foam profile value greater than about 1.1 when measured using a Foam Profile Test.<br>
Conveyor lubricants that contain silicone and foam are heretofore unknown.<br>
34<br><br>
WO 20(17/(140677	PCT/IJS2006/023299<br>
Lubricant compositions which exhibit foam profile values greater than about 1.1<br>
may be advantageous because they offer a visual indication of the presence of<br>
lubricant, because foam allows movement of lubricant to areas of the conveyor that<br>
are not wetted directly by nozzles, brushes, or other means of application, and<br>
because foam enhances contact of the lubricant composition with the package being<br>
conveyed. Lubricant compositions preferably have a foam profile value that is<br>
greater than about 1.1, more preferably greater than about 1.3, and most preferably<br>
greater than about 1.5, when evaluated using the Foam Profile Test described below.<br>
The lubricant compositions preferably create a coefficient of friction (COF)<br>
i that is less than about 0.20, more preferably less than about 0.15, and most<br>
preferably less than about 0.12, when evaluated using the Short Track Conveyor<br>
Test described below.<br>
A variety of kinds of conveyors and conveyor parts can be coated with the<br>
lubricant composition. Parts of the conveyor that support or guide or move the<br>
&gt; containers and thus are preferably coated with the lubricant composition include<br>
belts, chains, gates, chutes, sensors, and ramps having surfaces made of fabrics,<br>
metals, plastics, composites, or combinations of these materials.<br>
The lubricant composition can also be applied to a wide variety of containers<br>
including beverage containers; food containers; household or commercial cleaning<br>
i product containers; and containers for oils, antifreeze or other industrial fluids. The<br>
containers can be made of a wide variety of materials including glasses; plastics<br>
(e.g., polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene; polystyrenes; polyesters<br>
such as PET and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN); polyarnides, polycarbonates; and<br>
mixtures or copolymers thereof); metals (e.g., aluminum, tin or steel); papers (e.g.,<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
untreated, treated, waxed or other coated papers); ceramics; and laminates or<br>
composites of two or more of these materials (e.g., laminates of RET, PEN or<br>
mixtures thereof with another plastic material). The containers can have a variety of<br>
sizes and forms, including cartons (e.g., waxed cartons or TETRAPACK™ boxes),<br>
cans, bottles and the like. Although any desired portion of the container can be<br>
coated with the lubricant composition, the lubricant composition preferably is<br>
applied only to parts of the container that will come into contact with the conveyor<br>
or with other containers. For some such applications the lubricant composition<br>
preferably is applied to the conveyor rather than to the container.<br>
The lubricant composition can be a liquid or semi-solid at the time of<br>
application. Preferably the lubricant composition is a liquid having a viscosity that<br>
will permit it to be pumped and readily applied to a conveyor or containers, and that<br>
will facilitate rapid film formation whether or not the conveyor is in motion. The<br>
lubricant composition can be formulated so that it exhibits shear thinning or other<br>
pseudo-plastic behavior, manifested by a higher viscosity (e.g., non-dripping<br>
behavior) when at rest, and a much lower viscosity when subjected to shear stresses<br>
such as those provided by pumping, spraying or brushing the lubricant composition.<br>
This behavior can be brought about by, for example, including appropriate types and<br>
amounts of thixotropic fillers (e.g., treated or untreated fumed silicas) or other<br>
rheology modifiers in the lubricant composition.<br>
Methods of Application<br>
The lubricant coating can be applied in a constant or intermittent fashion.<br>
Preferably, the lubricant coating is applied in an intermittent fashion in order to<br>
minimize the amount of applied lubricant composition. It has been discovered that<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
the compositions of the present invention may be applied intermittently and<br>
maintain a low coefficient of friction in between applications, or avoid a condition<br>
known as "drying". Specifically, compositions of the present invention may be<br>
applied for a period of time and then not applied for at least 15 minutes, at least 30<br>
minutes, or at least 120 minutes or longer. The application period may be long<br>
enough to spread the composition over the conveyor belt (i.e. one revolution of the<br>
conveyor belt). During the application period, the actual application may be<br>
continuous, i.e. lubricant is applied to the entire conveyor, or intermittent, i.e.<br>
lubricant is applied in bands and the containers spread the lubricant around. The<br>
lubricant is preferably applied to the conveyor surface at a location that is not<br>
populated by packages or containers. For example, it is preferable to apply the<br>
lubricant spray upstream of the package or container flow or on the inverted<br>
conveyor surface moving underneath and upstream of the container or package.<br>
In some embodiments, the ratio of application time to non-application time<br>
may be 1:10, 1:30, 1:180, and 1:500 where the lubricant maintains a low coefficient<br>
of friction in between lubricant applications.<br>
In some embodiments, the lubricant maintains a coefficient of friction below<br>
about 0.2, below about 0.15, and below about 0.12.<br>
In some embodiments, a feedback loop may be used to determine when the<br>
coefficient of friction reaches an unacceptably high level. The feedback loop may<br>
trigger the lubricant composition to turn on for a period of time and then optionally<br>
turn the lubricant composition off when the coefficient of friction returns to an<br>
acceptable level.<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
The lubricant coating thickness preferably is maintained at at least about<br>
0.0001 mm, more preferably about 0.001 to about 2 mm, and most preferably about<br>
0.005 to about 0.5 mm.<br>
Application of the lubricant composition can be carried out using any<br>
suitable technique including spraying, wiping, brushing, drip coating, roll coating,<br>
and other methods for application of a thin film.<br>
The lubricant compositions can if desired be evaluated using a Contact<br>
Angle Measurement Test, a Surface Tension Test, a Coating Test, a Short Track<br>
Conveyor Test, a Foam Profile Test, and a PET Stress Crack Test.<br>
Contact Angle Measurement Test<br>
For the present invention, the contact angle of lubricant use compositions<br>
was measured using an FTA 200 Dynamic Contact Angle Analyzer available from<br>
First Ten Angstroms, Portsmouth, VA. A droplet of use composition was applied to<br>
Melinex 516 uncoated polyethylene terephthalate film using a 1 inch 22 gauge<br>
needle and the contact angle measured 10 seconds after applying the drop to the<br>
film. Melinex 516 film is a product of Dupont Teijin Films and is available in sheets<br>
from GE Polymershapes, Huntersville, NC.<br>
Surface Tension Test<br>
The surface tension of lubricant compositions was measured using a K12<br>
Microbalancc Surface Tensiometer available from Kriiss USA, Charlotte, NC.<br>
According to this method, the surface tension force resisting advancement of a<br>
platinum<br>
Wilhelmy plate into a sample of the conveyor lubricant mixture was measured<br>
directly<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
and the surface tension is reported mN/m (equivalent to dyne/cm).<br>
Coating Test<br>
A wet coating of lubricant composition was prepared by pipetting<br>
approximately 4 mL of lubricant composition onto an approximately 90 square inch<br>
sample of Melinex 516 uncoated polyethylene terephthalate film and spreading the<br>
puddle across the film surface by hand using a number 6 Mayer bar (available from<br>
RD Specialties, Webster NY). The thickness of the wet coating was approximately<br>
14 microns. The wet film was observed for wetting properties and defects in the wet<br>
coating including beading up and localized de-wetting. The coating was allowed to<br>
dry under ambient conditions and the properties of the dried film noted including<br>
contiguity and percent surface coverage.<br>
Short Track Conveyor Test<br>
A conveyor system employing a motor-driven 83 mm wide by 6.1 meter<br>
long REXNORD1M LF polyacetal thermoplastic conveyor belt was operated at a belt<br>
speed of 30.48 meters/minute. Four 20 ounce filled PET beverage bottles were<br>
lassoed and connected to a stationary strain gauge. The force exerted on the strain<br>
gauge during belt operation was recorded using a computer. A thin, even coat of the<br>
lubricant composition was applied to the surface of the belt using conventional<br>
lubricant spray nozzles which apply a total of 4 gallons of lubricant composition per<br>
hour. The belt was allowed to run for 25 to 90 minutes during which time a<br>
consistently low drag force was observed. The coefficient of friction (COF) was<br>
calculated by dividing the drag force (F) by the weight of the four 20 ounce filled<br>
PUT beverage bottles (W): COF = F/W.<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
Foam Profile Test<br>
According to this test, 200 mL of room temperature lubricant composition in<br>
a stoppered 500 mL glass graduated cylinder was inverted 10 times. Immediately<br>
after the tenth inversion, the total volume of liquid plus foam was recorded. The<br>
stoppered cylinder was allowed to remain stationary, and 60 seconds after the last<br>
inversion of the cylinder the total volume of liquid plus foam was recorded. The<br>
foam profile value is the ratio of the total volume of liquid plus foam at 60 seconds<br>
divided by the original volume.<br>
PET Stress Crack Test<br>
Compatibility of lubricant compositions with PET beverage bottles was<br>
determined by charging bottles with carbonated water, contacting with lubricant<br>
composition, storing at elevated temperatures and humidity for a period of 28 days,<br>
and counting the number of bottles that either burst or leaked through cracks in the<br>
base portion of the bottle. Standard twenty ounce "Global Swirl" bottles (available<br>
from Constar International) were charged successively with 658 g of chilled water at<br>
0 lo 5 C, 10.6 g of citric acid, and 10.6 g of sodium bicarbonate. Immediately after<br>
addition of sodium bicarbonate, the charged bottle was capped, rinsed with<br>
deionized water and stored at ambient conditions (20 - 25 C) overnight. Twenty four<br>
bottles thus charged were dipped in lubricant working composition up to the seam<br>
which separates the base and sidewall portions of the bottle and swirled for<br>
approximately five seconds, then placed in a standard bus pan (part number<br>
4034039, available from Sysco, Houston TX) lined with a polyethylene bag.<br>
Additional lubricant working composition was poured into the bus pan around the<br>
bottles so that the total amount of lubricant composition in the pan (carried in on<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/IIS2006/023299<br>
bottles and poured in separately) was equal to 132 g. The lubricant composition was<br>
not foamed for this test. For each lubricant tested, a total of four bus pans of 24<br>
bottles were used. Immediately after placing bottles and lubricant into bus pans, the<br>
bus pans were removed to a humidity chamber under conditions of 100 F and 85%<br>
relative humidity. Bins were checked on a daily basis and number of failed bottles<br>
(burst or leak of liquid through cracks in the bottle base) was recorded. At the end of<br>
28 days, the amount of crazing on the base region of bottles that did not fail during<br>
humidity testing was evaluated. A visual crazing score was given to bottles where 0<br>
= no crazing is evident, the bottle base remains clear; and 10 = pronounced crazing<br>
to s he extent that the base has become opaque.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention can be better understood by reviewing the following<br>
examples.<br>
The examples are for illustration purposes only, and do not limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A<br>
(Deionized water with 200 ppm added alkalinity)<br>
A solution of deionized water containing 200 ppm alkalinity as CaC03 was<br>
prepared by dissolving 0.336g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water.<br>
The contact angle of the solution on PET film was determined to be 67 degrees. The<br>
wetting behavior of the solution was evaluated by the coating test described above.<br>
Upon coating, the solution beaded up immediately giving isolated drops which dried<br>
to give water spots which covered approximately 5% of the film surface. The foam<br>
profile value for the solution measured as described above was 1.0. The alkaline<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
water solution was tested for PET compatibility as described above. After 28 days of<br>
storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 20 of 96 bottles had<br>
failed (21%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 1.7.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B<br>
(silicone lubricant)<br>
A solution of deionized water containing 2000 ppm alkalinity as CaC03 was<br>
prepared by dissolving 3.36 g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water. A<br>
lubricant composition was prepared by adding 5.0 g of a 10% dilution of Lambent<br>
E2140FG silicone emulsion with water and 200 g of 2000 ppm alkaline water to<br>
1795 g of deionized water. The lubricant composition contained 250 ppm Lambent<br>
E2140FG silicone emulsion and 336 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 200<br>
ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET<br>
film was determined to be 64 degrees, and the surface tension of the composition<br>
was 38.7 dynes/cm. The wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was'<br>
evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon coating, the composition<br>
beaded up immediately giving isolated drops which dried to give water spots which<br>
covered approximately 5% of the film surface. The foam profile value for the<br>
composition measured as described above was 1.0. The silicone lubricant<br>
composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon after 28 days of storage<br>
under conditions of 100'F and 85% relative humidity, 22 of 96 bottles had failed<br>
(23%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 2.1. What<br>
this comparative example shows is that addition of silicone lubricant to alkaline<br>
water does not cause a significant change in the proportion of failed bottles in the<br>
PET compatibility test relative to alkaline water alone.<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
(silicone lubricant plus alcohol ethoxylate wetting agent)<br>
A lubricant composition was prepared by adding 8.0 g of a 10% aqueous<br>
solution of Surfonic L 24-7 surfactant (available from Huntsman Chemical, Houston<br>
TX) to 992 g of the silicone lubricant composition of Comparative Example B. The<br>
lubricant composition contained 248 ppm Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion, 800<br>
ppm of Surfonic L 24-7, and 333 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 200 ppm<br>
alkalinity as OaCO.-)). The contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET film<br>
was determined to be 24 degrees, and the surface tension of the composition was<br>
28.3 dynes/cm. The wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by<br>
the coating test described above. Upon coating, the composition gave a uniform film<br>
with approximately 10 pin head size spots where the liquid had partially de wet the<br>
surface. When dried, the coating was slightly hazy, with about 16 spots about 1 cm<br>
in diameter where the composition had partially de wet the film. Around each defect<br>
was a diffuse hazy halo. The dried coating covered approximately 95% of the<br>
surface. The foam profile value for the composition measured as described above<br>
was 1.9. The silicone plus alcohol ethoxylate composition lubricant was tested for<br>
P'l <t compatibility whereupon after days of storage under conditions f and></t>
85% relative humidity, 14 of 96 bottles had failed (15%). The visual crazing score<br>
for the unfailed bottles in this test was 6.8. What this example shows is that addition<br>
of an alcohol ethoxylate wetting agent to a silicone lube improves the wetting of the<br>
lubricant composition to a PET surface and gives a reduction in the failure rate of<br>
bottles in the PET compatibility test compared to a silicone lubricant without<br>
wetting agent.<br>

WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
(silicone lubricant plus silicone wetting agent)<br>
A lubricant composition was prepared by adding 5.2 g of a 10% aqueous<br>
solution of Silwet 1.-11 surfactant (available from GE Silicones, Friendly, WV) to<br>
1000 g of the silicone lubricant composition of Comparative Example B. The<br>
lubricant composition contained 249 ppm Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion, 517<br>
ppm of Silwet L-77, and 334 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 200 ppm<br>
alkalinity as CaCOs). The contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET film<br>
was determined to be 49 degrees. The surface tension of the composition was 23.6<br>
dynes/cm. The wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the<br>
coating test described above. Upon coating, the composition gave a film with<br>
approximately 100 spots of about 0.5 cm diameter where the liquid had de wet the<br>
surface. When dried, the coating was hazy, with about 100 de wet spots about 0.7<br>
cm in diameter. Around each defect was a diffuse hazy halo. The dried coating<br>
covered approximately 50% of the surface. The foam profile value for the<br>
composition measured as described above was 1.1. The silicone plus silicone<br>
wetting agent lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon<br>
after 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 14 of<br>
96 bottles had failed (15%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this<br>
test was 6.3. What this example shows is that addition of a silicone surfactant<br>
wetting agent to a silicone lube improves the wetting of the lubricant composition to<br>
a PET surface and gives a reduction in the failure rate of bottles in the PET<br>
compatibility test compared to a silicone lubricant without wetting agent.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
(silicone lubricant plus nonyl phenol ethoxylate wetting agent)<br>
A lubricant composition was prepared by adding 8.0 g of a 10% aqueous<br>
solution of Surfonic N95 surfactant (available from Huntsman Chemical, Houston<br>
TX) to 992 g of the silicone lubricant composition of Comparative Example B. The<br>
lubricant composition contained 249 ppm Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion, 800<br>
ppm of Silwet L-77, and 334 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 200 ppm<br>
alkalinity as CaC03). The contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET film<br>
was determined to be 15 degrees. The surface tension of the composition was 42.4<br>
dynes/cm. The wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the<br>
coating test described above. Upon coating, the composition gave a substantially<br>
uniform film with no defects or de wet spots. When dried, the coating was slightly<br>
hazy, with non-uniform gradations of haziness. The dried coating covered<br>
approximately 99% of the surface. The foam profile value for the composition<br>
measured as described above was 1.8. The silicone plus nonyl phenol ethoxylate<br>
wetting agent lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon<br>
after 28 days of storage under conditions of 100F C and 85% relative humidity, 10<br>
of 96 bottles had failed (10%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in<br>
this test was 7.8. What this example shows is that addition of a nonyl phenol<br>
ethoxylate wetting agent to a silicone lube improves the wetting of the lubricant<br>
composition to a PET surface and gives a reduction in the failure rate of bottles in<br>
the PET compatibility test compared to a silicone lubricant without wetting agent.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
(silicone lubricant plus fatty amine plus alcohol ethoxylate wetting agent)<br>
An acidified fatty amine solution was prepared by adding 29 g of glacial<br>
acetic acid and 80.0g of Duomeen OL (available from Akzo Nobel Surface<br>
Chemistry LLC, Chicago, TL) to 691 g of deionized water. A lubricant concentrate<br>
composition was prepared by adding 15 g of Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion,<br>
24 g of Surfonic L 24-7 surfactant, and 150 g of acidified fatty amine solution to 111<br>
« of deionized water. A lubricant composition was prepared by adding 5.0 g of the<br>
lubricant concentrate composition to a solution of 0.336 g of sodium bicarbonate in<br>
1 OOOg of deionized water. The lubricant composition contained 250 ppm Lambent<br>
H2140FG silicone emulsion, 250 ppm of Duomeen OL, 400 ppm of Surfonic L 24-7,<br>
and 336 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 200 ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The<br>
contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET film was determined to be 32<br>
degrees. The surface tension of the composition was 28.0 dynes/cm. The wetting<br>
behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test described<br>
above. Upon coating, the composition gave a film with approximately 50 pencil<br>
eraser size dc wet spots which dried to give an imperfect film which covered<br>
approximately 80% of the PET surface. The foam profile value for the composition<br>
measured as described above was 1.8. The lubricant composition was tested for<br>
PET compatibility as described above whereupon after 28 days of storage under<br>
conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 7 of 96 bottles had failed (7%). The<br>
visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 4.1. What this example<br>
shows is that addition of a wetting agent comprising a mixture of acidified fatty<br>
amine and alcohol ethoxylate compounds to a silicone lube improves the wetting of<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
the lubricant composition to a PET surface and gives a reduction in the failure rate<br>

wetting agent.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C<br>
(Deionized water with 100 ppm added alkalinity)<br>

prepared by dissolving 0.168 g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water.<br>
The wetting behavior of the solution was evaluated by the coating test described<br>
above. Upon coating, the solution beaded up immediately giving isolated drops<br>
which dried to give water spots which covered approximately 5% of the film<br>
surface. The alkaline water solution was tested for PET compatibility as described<br>
above. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 19 of 120 bottles had failed (16%). The visual crazing score for the<br>
unfailed bottles in this test was 1.4.<br>

K2140FG silicone emulsion, 7.5 ppm Pluronic F108 poly(ethylene oxide-propylene<br>
oxide) block copolymer, 5.0 ppm methyl paraben, and 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate<br>
(equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCOs). The contact angle of the lubricant<br>
composition on PET film was determined to be 64 degrees. The wetting behavior of<br>
the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon<br>
coating, the composition beaded up immediately giving isolated drops which dried<br>
to give water spots which covered approximately 5% of the film surface. The<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PO7US2006/023299<br>
silicone plus watcr-miscible lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility<br>
whereupon after 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 9 of 48 bottles had failed (19%). What this comparative example shows is<br>
that addition of a composition of silicone plus water-miscible lubricant to alkaline<br>
water does not cause a significant improvement in wetting of the composition to a<br>
PET surface and does not cause a significant improvement in the proportion of<br>
failed bottles in the PET compatibility test relative to alkaline water alone.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE E<br>

A commercial lubricant composition was prepared which contained 2500<br>
ppm of Dicolube TPB (product of Johnson Diversey) and 168 ppm sodium<br>
bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The contact angle of the<br>
lubricant composition on PET film was determined to be 72 degrees. The wetting<br>
behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test described<br>
above. Upon coating, the composition beaded up immediately giving isolated drops<br>
which dried to give water spots which covered less than 5% of the film surface. The<br>
commercial lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon after<br>
28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 7 of 48<br>
bottles had failed (15%). What this comparative example shows is that addition of a<br>
composition of a commercial silicone lubricant to alkaline water does not cause a<br>
significant improvement in wetting of the composition to a PET surface and does<br>
not cause a significant improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET<br>
compatibility test relative to alkaline water alone.<br>

acetic acid and 80.0g of Duomeen OL (available from Akzo Nobel Surface<br>
Chemistry LLC, Chicago, IL) to 691 g of deionized water. A lubricant concentrate<br>
composition was prepared by adding 25.0 g of acidified fatty amine composition,<br>
8.0 g of Surfonic L 24-7 surfactant, and 2.5 g of Dow Corning HV-490 silicone<br>
emulsion to 64.5 g of deionized water. A lubricant composition was prepared by<br>
adding 5.0 g of the lubricant concentrate composition to a solution of 0.168 g of<br>
sodium bicarbonate in 1 OOOg of deionized water. The lubricant composition<br>
contained 125 ppm Dow Corning HV-490 silicone emulsion, 125 ppm of Duomeen<br>
01,, 400 ppm of Surfonic L 24-7, and 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to<br>
100 ppm alkalinity as CaCC^). The contact angle of the lubricant composition on<br>
PET film was determined to be 29 degrees. The wetting behavior of the lubricant<br>
composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon coating, the<br>
composition gave a continuous coating with about 40 de wet areas about 0.5 to 1 cm<br>
in diameter. The wet coating covered about 80 - 90% of the PET surface. Upon<br>
drying, the composition gave a substantially continuous film which covered<br>
approximately 70% of the PET surface. The foam profile value for the composition<br>
measured as described above was 1.8. The lubricant composition was tested for<br>
PET compatibility as described above whereupon after 28 days of storage under<br>
conditions of 100E and 85% relative humidity, 9 of 96 bottles had failed (9%). The<br>
visual crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 7.5. What this example<br>
shows is that addition of a composition of a wetting agent comprising a mixture of<br>

improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET compatibility test relative<br>
to a silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
(Silicone lubricant plus citric acid/sodium citrate plus alcohol ethoxylate wetting<br>
agent)<br>
A lubricant concentrate composition was prepared by adding 2.5g of Dow<br>
Corning HV-490 silicone emulsion, 7.0g citric acid, 2.1 g of a 50% solution of<br>
NaOH, 2.0 g of Tomadol 91-8 alcohol ethoxylate, and 2.85g of a 35% solution of<br>
H2O2 to 83.6 g deionized water. A lubricant composition was prepared by diluting<br>
! .0 g of the lubricant concentrate composition with 399 g of a solution of 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate in deionized water. The resulting lubricant composition<br>
contained 63 ppm Dow Corning HV-490 silicone emulsion, 175 ppm citric acid, 26<br>
ppm NaOH, 50 ppm Tomadol 91-8 alcohol ethoxylate, 25 ppm H2O2, and 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCCh). The ratio of<br>
unneutralizcd acid equivalents from the lubricant concentrate composition to<br>
equivalents of base from the alkaline water was 1.00 to 1.00. The pH of the<br>
lubricant composition was 5.94. The contact angle of the lubricant composition on<br>
PET film was determined to be 58 degrees. The wetting behavior of the lubricant<br>
composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon coating, the<br>
composition beaded up immediately and dried to give spots which covered less than<br>
5% of the PET surface. The foam profile value for the composition measured as<br>
described above was 1.3. The silicone lubricant composition was tested for PET<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2007/040677	PCT/US2006/023299<br>
compatibility as described, except that 20 oz "Contour" bottles available from<br>
Southeastern Container Corp. (Enka, NC) were substituted for 20 ounce "Global<br>
Swirl" bottles. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 1 of 96 bottles had failed (1%). The crazing score for the unfailed bottles<br>
: in this test was 3.4. What this example shows is that including approximately one<br>
equivalent of unneutralized acid for every equivalent of alkalinity in lube dilution<br>
water and decreasing the contact angle of the lubricant composition to less than<br>
about 60 degrees is capable to reduce the failure rate of bottles in the PET<br>
compatibility test relative to a silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition. In<br>
) a separate test, 20 g of the lubricant concentrate composition was diluted with 10 Kg<br>
of city water and the coefficient of friction using the Short Track Conveyor Test<br>
described above. The coefficient of friction between 4 20 ounce "Global Swirl"<br>
bottles and Delrin track was 0.11.<br>

An acidified fatty amine solution was prepared by adding 29 g of glacial<br>

K2140FG silicone emulsion to 58.0 g of deionized water. A lubricant composition<br>
was prepared by adding 5.0 g of the lubricant concentrate composition to a solution<br>
of 0.168 g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water. The lubricant<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2(107/040677	PCT/1JS2006/023299<br>

Duomeen OL, 400 ppm of Surfonic L 24-7, 286 ppm lactic acid, and 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCOs). The contact angle<br>
of the lubricant composition on PET film was determined to be 39 degrees. The<br>
wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test<br>
described above. Upon coating, the composition gave a film with approximately 30<br>
pencil eraser size de wet spots which dried to give an imperfect film which covered<br>
approximately 75% of the PET surface. The foam profile value for the composition<br>
measured as described above was 1.7. The lubricant composition was tested for PET<br>
compatibility as described, except that 20 oz "Contour" bottles available from<br>
Southeastern Container Corp. (Enka, NC) were substituted for 20 ounce "Global<br>
Swirl" bottles. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 0 of 96 bottles had failed (0%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed<br>
bottles in this test was 7.6. What this example shows is that addition of a wetting<br>
agent comprising a mixture of acidified fatty amine and alcohol ethoxylate<br>
compounds and a stoichiometric amount of organic acid to a silicone lubricant<br>
composition causes an improvement in wetting of the composition to a PET surface<br>
and an improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET compatibility test<br>
relative to a silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition.<br>

group consisting of a fatty amine, an alcohol ethoxylate, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The passage of a container along a conveyor is lubricated by<br>
applying to the container or conveyor a composition comprising a<br>
water-miscible silicone material wherein the composition has<br>
good wetting to polyethylene terephthalate surfaces. The<br>
compatibility of the lubricating composition with polyethylene<br>
terephthalate is increased because the wetting of the<br>
composition to polyethylene terephthalate is improved.<br></td>
