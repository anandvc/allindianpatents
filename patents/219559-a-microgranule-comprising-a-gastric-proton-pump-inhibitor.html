				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation of a gastric proton pump inhibitor, with the exception of omeprazole. This formulation is in the form of microgranules insoluble in gastric fluid having an improved stability over time.<br>
The present invention additionally applies to the process for the manufacture of said microgranules and to the pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
The gastric proton pump inhibitors coming within the scope of the present invention are benzimidazole or thienoimidazole derivatives, with the exception of omeprazole, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The proton pump inhibitors coming within the scope of the   present   invention   include   in   particular lansoprazole,  pantoprazole,  perprazole,  pariprazole, leminoprazole,  timoprazole and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Proton pump inhibitors are known for the treatment and prevention of diseases relating to excessive secretion of  gastric  acid,  such  as  esophagitis,  gastritis, duodenitis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer.<br>
These compounds can also be used in patients who are following an anti-AIDS therapy and in patients suffering from gastroesbphageal reflux or from gastrinoma.<br>
Finally, these compounds are of use in the treatment of psoriasis and infections caused by Helicobacter.<br><br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the invention are compounds capable of decomposing in acidic or neutral medium, with the result that a formulation comprising them must be:<br>
enteric,  in order for the active principle to<br>
reach the small intestine, and<br>
protected against heat, moisture, organic solvents<br>
and light, to a lesser extent.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel formulation insoluble in gastric fluid of a proton pump inhibitor comprising at least two hydrophobic substances, the role of which is to improve the stability of the formulation on storage.<br>
Formulations comprising a benzimidazole derivative and a hydrophobic substance already exist in the prior art but this substance is not particularly used to increase the stability of the formulation. In addition, these formulations comprise alkaline compounds and/or ionic surfactants.<br>
WO 96/01624  discloses  tablets  formed  from  enteric microgranules comprising a proton pump, inhibitor. The object  of  the  invention  disclosed  is  to  prepare microgranules which can be tableted without modifying the properties of their enteric layer. To obtain the desired mechanical properties, the enteric layer must comprise plasticizers, such as polysorbates, PEGs and cetyl  alcohol.  The  enteric  layer  is,  for  example, composed of 74-80% of a methacrylic copolymer, 16-23% of    triethyl    citrate    and    1-3%    of    a monoglycerides/diglycerides    mixture.     WO 96/01624 discloses the use of a specific plasticizer in the enteric layer for improving the ability of the granules to be tableted. In addition, the compositions disclosed comprise an ionic surfactant,  such as sodium lauryl sulfate,  or  an  al'kaline  salt, 4 such  as  calcium phosphate.<br><br>
WO 97/12581 discloses stable omeprazole granules without any basifying compound. Conventionally, the enteric layer comprises a plasticizer, such as triethyl citrate. The granules can comprise lubricants exhibiting hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, an ionic surfactant, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, or crospovidone, which has an alkaline nature, are combined with the active principle.<br>
WO 98/19668   discloses   omeprazole   granules,   the stability of which is improved by inserting a barrier layer  between  the  enteric  coating  and  the  active principle. This barrier layer serves to protect the active principle from ambient moisture and from the enteric polymer,  which has  an  acidic  nature.  This document - does not suggest the us,e of a hydrophobic Substance in the barrier layer but it can comprise Simethicone® in a proportion by mass of 0.4% with respect to the weight of the active principle. Myvacet® is employed as plasticize.r in the enteric layer. The granules are composed of an alkaline core which can comprise magnesium, calcium or aluminum hydroxides or oxides, trisodium phosphate or magnesium trisilicate.<br>
The documents of the prior art which relate to solid oral formulations of proton pump inhibitors for which it  is  desired  to  increase  the  stability  disclose formulations which comprise hydrophobic substances but these documents  do not  teach that  the  hydrophobic substances are of use in increasing the stability on storage.   In  contrast,   in  these  documents,   the hydrophobic  substances  are  used  conventionally  as plasticizers  in  the  enteric  layer   (WO 96/01624, WO 97/12581    and    WO 98/19668),    as    lubricant (WO 97/12581) or as binder (WO 98/19668). Furthermore, the compositions which they disclose comprise alkaline compounds or ionic surfactants.<br><br>
In order to improve the duration of stability on storage of formulations insoluble in gastric fluid comprising a proton pump inhibitor, a proposal has been made, in the prior art, to introduce an alkaline substance and a. hydrophobic substance into the formulation.<br>
WO 98/52564 discloses benzimidazole granules comprising an inert nucleus coated with a layer comprising the active principle in combination with an alkaline substance, with a barrier layer composed of a hydrophobic substance, and with an enteric layer. The hydrophobic substance is a polyalkylsiloxane, a mineral oil, isopropyl myristate, stearic acid or cetyl alcohol. The alkaline substance is, for example, ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate.<br>
WO 98/52564 provides an improvement to the stability of benzimidazole granules by inserting a hydrophobic film between the active principle and the enteric coating and by using an alkaline substance in combination with the active principle.<br>
There also exist, in the prior art, two documents relating to formulations of a proton pump inhibitor which are not insoluble in gastric fluid, which are not in the form of microgranules and which comprise hydrophobic substances.<br>
WO 96/31213 relates to a pasty oral formulation of a proton pump inhibitor for a veterinary use or for people   having   difficulty   in   swallowing.   This formulation  is  stable  on  long-term  storage.   It comprises  a  hydrophobic oily  liquid vehicle  and  a- • hydrophobic thickening agent. The oily vehicle is, for example, Miglyol 810®. The thickening, agent is cetearyl alcohol, liquid paraffin or hydrogenated castor oil. The formulation also c6mprises basifying agents, such as potassium sorbate or triethanolamine. The teaching<br><br>
of  this  document  is  specific  to  a  semisolid formulation.<br>
EP 769 938 discloses prolonged-release soft capsules comprising active substances which are unstable toward moisture, oxidation and gastric fluid.<br>
Conventional soft capsules are mainly composed of a mass of hydrated gelatin and of numerous additives which may prove to be incompatible with the active principle. EP 769 938 guarantees the stability of the soft capsules comprising moisture-sensitive active principles by isolating the active principle from the gelatin body. The soft capsules of EP 769 938 are composed<br>
of a core comprising the active principle and 70%<br>
silicone, coated - .  with a first layer composed of gelatin, sorbitol<br>
and glycerol, coated<br>
with a silicone film.<br>
The teaching of EP 769 938 is restricted to soft capsules which are not insoluble in gastric fluid.<br>
There does not exist, in the prior art, a formulation insoluble in gastric fluid formed from microgranules comprising a benzimidazole derivative which is stable on storage, which has no alkaline substances and which comprises a hydrophobic substance, both in the active layer and in the enteric layer.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a formulation insoluble in gastric fluid -formed from microgranules of a gastric proton pump inhibitor, with the exception of omeprazole, which has an improved long-term stability on storage and which additionally exhibits the desired therapeutic properties, that is to say a degree of resistance to dissolution in acid medium and a rapid solubility in neutral medium.<br><br>

sulfate, and<br>
