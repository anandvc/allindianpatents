The compounds of formula (I) may comprise one or more asymmetric carbon atoms.<br>
They may thus exist in the form of enantiomers or diastereoisomers. These enantiomers<br>
and diastereoisomers, and also mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of<br>
the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in the form of bases or of acid-addition salts.<br>
Such addition salts form part of the invention.<br>
These salts are advantageously prepared with pharmaceutical^ acceptable acids, but the<br>
salts of other acids that are useful, for example, for purifying or isolating the compounds<br>
of formula (I) also form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be in the form of hydrates or solvates, i.e. in<br>
the form of associations or combinations with one or more water molecules or with a<br>
solvent. Such hydrates and solvates also form part of the invention.<br>
In the text hereinbelow, the term "leaving group" means a group that can be readily<br>
cleaved from a molecule by breaking a heterolytic bond, with loss of an electron pair. This<br>
group may thus be readily replaced with another group, for example during a substitution<br>
reaction. Such leaving groups are, for example, halogens or an activated hydroxyl group<br>
such as a methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, triflate, acetate, etc.<br>
Examples of leaving groups and references for preparing them are given in "Advances in<br>
Organic Chemistry", J. March, 5th Edition, Wiley Interscience, 2001.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared<br>
according to the process illustrated in scheme 1 below.<br>
According to scheme 1, the compounds of general formula (IV) may be obtained by<br>
reacting a compound of general formula (II) in which X is as defined in the general<br>
formula (I) above and B represents a d-C6-alkoxyl or hydroxyl group, with a compound<br>
of general formula (III), in which Zu Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5 and n are as defined in the general<br>
formula (I) above and R' represents a leaving group or a hydroxyl group when n is equal<br>
to 1, 2 or 3 or R' represents a leaving group when n is equal to 0.<br>
When the compound of general formula (III) is defined such that n is equal to 1, 2 or 3<br>
and R' represents a leaving group such as a bromine or iodine atom, the reaction may be<br>
performed in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or potassium carbonate, in<br>
a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or acetone (n = 1: Kolasa<br><br>
14<br>
T., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997, 5 (3) 507, n = 2: Abramovitch R., Synth. Commun., 1995,<br>
25(1), 1).<br><br>
When the compound of general formula (III) is defined such that n is equal to 1, 2 or 3<br>
and R' represents a hydroxyl group, the compounds of general formula (IV) may be<br>
obtained by reacting the compound of general formula (II) with a compound of general<br><br>
15<br>
formula (III) in the presence of a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine and a reagent<br>
such as diethyl azodicarboxylate in solution in a solvent such as dichloromethane or<br>
tetrahydrofuran (O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1-28).<br>
When the compound of general formula (III) is defined such that n is equal to 0, R'<br>
represents a leaving group such as a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom and the reaction<br>
may be performed at a temperature of between 80°C and 250°C, in the presence of a<br>
copper-based catalyst such as copper bromide or copper oxide and also of a base such<br>
as potassium carbonate (Murakami Y., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1995, 43 (8), 1281). The<br>
milder conditions described in S.L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 11684 may<br>
also be used.<br>
In the context of the invention, the compounds of general formula (IV) in which B<br>
represents a C-i-Co-alkoxyl group may be converted into compounds of general formula<br>
(IV) in which B represents a hydroxyl group according to methods known to those skilled<br>
in the art, for example in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide in a solvent<br>
such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
In the context of the invention, the compounds of general formula (IV) in which B<br>
represents a hydroxyl group may be converted into compounds of general formula (IV) in<br>
which B represents a d-CValkoxyl group according to methods known to those skilled<br>
in the art, for example in the presence of an acid such as sulfuric acid in a solvent such<br>
as methanol or ethanol.<br>
In the case of the compounds of general formula (IV), in which B represents a CrC6-<br>
alkoxyl group, the compound of general formula (I) can be obtained by reacting a<br>
compound of general formula (IV), as obtained above, with an amide of the compound of<br>
general formula (V), in which W is as defined in general formula (I) above, at the reflux<br>
point of a solvent such as toluene. The aluminium amide of the compound of general<br>
formula (V) is prepared by first reacting trimethylaluminium with the amines of general<br>
formula (V).<br>
In the case of the compounds of general formula (IV), in which B represents a hydroxyl<br>
group, the carboxylic acid function may be converted beforehand into an acid halide such<br>
as an acid chloride via the action of thionyl chloride, at the reflux point of a solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane or dichloroethane. The compound of general formula (I) is then<br>
obtained by reacting the compound of general formula (IV), in which B represents a<br><br>
16<br>
chlorine atom, with the compound of general formula (V), in the presence of a base such<br>
as triethylamine or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (IV), in which B represents a hydroxyl<br>
group, may be coupled with the compounds of general formula (V) in the presence of a<br>
coupling agent such as a dialkyl carbodiimide, benzotriazol-1-<br>
yloxytris(pyrrolidinophosphonium) hexafluorophosphate, diethyl cyanophosphonate or<br>
any other coupling agent known to those skilled in the art, in the presence of a base such<br>
as triethylamine, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>

their preparation method is not described, are commercially available, described in the<br>
literature or prepared by analogy with numerous processes described in the literature (M.<br>

3.1	g (22.44 mmol) of 4-methyl-3-nitropyridine and 16.39 g (112.22 mmol) of ethyl oxalate<br>
are placed in a 100 ml three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and<br>
maintained under a flush of nitrogen. 3.69 ml (24.69 mmol) of 1,8-diaza-<br>
bicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene are then added to the reaction medium stirred at room<br>
temperature. The reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and then<br>
diluted with a mixture of ethyl acetate (150 ml), water (100 ml) and acetic acid (4 ml). The<br>
mixture is extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are washed<br>
with 100 ml of water, with 100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude reaction<br>
product is then triturated from pentane, filtered and then heated in petroleum ether,<br>
filtered and dried under reduced pressure. 3.9 g (16.37 mmol) of product are thus<br>
isolated, and are used without further purification in the following step.<br>

culturing.<br>

The measuring chambers (volume 800 ul) containing the cell preparation are placed on<br>
the platform of an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2) equipped with Hoffman optics<br>
(Modulation Contrast, New York) and observed at a magnification of 400X. The<br>
chambers are continuously gravity-influxed (2.5 ml/min) using a solution distributor<br>
accepting 8 inlets and whose sole outlet, consisting of a polyethylene tube (aperture<br>
500 urn), is placed less than 3 mm from the cell under study. The "whole cell"<br>
configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used. The borosilicate glass pipettes<br>
(resistance 5-10 MOhms) are brought to the cell by means of a 3D piezoelectric<br>
micromanipulator (Burleigh, PC1000). The overall currents (membrane potential set at<br>
-60 mV) are recorded with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster city,<br>
California), connected to a PC running the Pclamp8 software (Axon Instrument). The<br>
current plots are recorded on paper and simultaneously digitized (sampling frequency 15<br>
to 25 Hz) and acquired on the hard drive of the PC.<br>
The application of a 300 nM capsaicin solution induces on the DRG cells (voltage set at<br>
-70 mV) an entering cationic current. In order to minimize the desensitization of the<br>
receptors, a minimum interval of one minute between two applications of capsaicin is<br>
observed. After a control period (stabilization of the capsaicin response alone), the test<br>
compounds are applied alone at a given concentration (concentration of 10 nM or 1 nM)<br>
for a time of 4 to 5 minutes, during which several capsaicin + compound tests are<br>
performed (to obtain the maximum inhibition). The results are expressed as a percentage<br>
of inhibition of the control capsaicin response.<br><br>
46<br>
The percentages of inhibition of the capsaicin response (300 nM) are between 20% and<br>
100% for the most active compounds of the invention tested at concentrations of 0.1 to<br>
10 nM. The compounds of the invention are thus effective in vitro antagonists of<br>
receptors of TRPV1 type.<br>
Test of mouse corneal irritation<br>
The irritant nature of capsaicin is readily assessed on the cornea since this organ is one<br>
of the organs most densely innervated with C fibres. In this context, from preliminary<br>
experiments, the application of a very small amount of capsaicin (2 pi at a concentration<br>
of 160 uM) to the surface of the cornea of an animal leads to a certain number of<br>
stereotypical behavioural traits associated with irritation, which are easy to record. Among<br>
these, the following are noted: blinking of the eye, rubbing of the instilled eye with the<br>
ipsilateral front paw, rubbing of the face with both front paws, scratching of the ipsilateral<br>
face with the hind paw. The duration of this behaviour does not exceed the 2 minutes of<br>
observation, and the animal then resumes its normal activity. Its aspect is moreover also<br>
normal. The mouse is not recluse in a corner with raised hackles and does not develop<br>
any observable sign of suffering. It may be concluded therefrom that the duration of<br>
action of capsaicin at these doses is less than 2 minutes.<br>
Summary of the methodology:<br>
The principle of the series of experiments is to determine whether the compounds of the<br>
invention can influence the behavioural response induced with a given amount of<br>
capsaicin. The capsaicin is initially diluted to 25 mM in DMSO and diluted, for its final<br>
use, in Tween 80 to 10% in physiological saline. It appears, from control studies, that,<br>
under these conditions, the solvent has no effect.<br>
In practice, the test product is administered orally and, with a delay (pretreatment time: t)<br>
that depends on the pharmacokinetic data, the animal receives an ocular instillation of<br>
2 pi of a 160 uM capsaicin solution prepared as indicated above. During a 2-minute<br>
observation following the instillation, the number of times the instilled eye is rubbed with<br>
the ipsilateral front paw is recorded.<br>
For a given animal, the percentage of protection is calculated as follows:<br>
P= 100 - ((number of scratching actions observed/mean number of scratching actions<br>
for the group treated with the solvent) x 100)<br>
This percentage of protection is averaged for each group of animals (n = number of<br>
animals tested with the compound of the invention).<br><br>
47<br>
The percentages of protection evaluated in this model for the most active compounds of<br>
the invention, used at doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg (po), are between 20% and 100% (see the<br>
example in Table 5).<br>

The results of these tests show that the most active compounds of the invention block<br>
the effects induced by stimulation of the TRPV1 receptors.<br>
The compounds of the invention may thus be used for the preparation of medicaments,<br>
especially for the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating pathologies in<br>
which the TRPV1 receptors are involved.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicaments that<br>
comprise a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically accf^tgble salt, or<br>
alternatively a hydrate or a solvate of the said compound.<br>
These medicaments find their therapeutic use especially in the prevention and/or<br>
treatment of pain and inflammation, chronic pain, neuropathic pain (trauma-related,<br>
diabetic, metabolic, infection-related or toxic pain, or pain induced by an anticancer or<br>
iatrogenic treatment), (osteo)arthritic pain, rheumatic pain, fibromyalgia, back pain,<br>
cancer-related pain, facial neuralgia, headaches, migraine, dental pain, burns, sunburn,<br>
animal bites or insect bites, post-herpetic neuralgia, muscular pain, trapped nerves<br>
(central and/or peripheral), spinal column and/or brain trauma, ischaemia (of the spinal<br>
column and/or the brain), neurodegeneration, haemorrhagic strokes (of the spinal<br>
column and/or of the brain) and post-stroke pain.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used for the preparation of a medicament for<br>
preventing and/or treating urological disorders such as hyperactivity of the bladder,<br>
vesical hyperreflexia, vesical instability, incontinence, urgent micturition, urinary<br>
incontinence, cystitis, nephritic colic, pelvic hypersensitivity and pelvic pain.<br><br>

and/or treating gynaecological disorders, for instance vulvodynia and pain associated<br>
with salpingitis or with dysmenorrhoea.<br>
These products may also be used for the preparation of a medicament for preventing<br>
and/or treating gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrooesophageal reflux disorder,<br>
stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers, functional dyspepsia, colitis, IBS, Crohn's disease,<br>
pancreatitis, oesophagitis and biliary colic.<br>
