				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM TO MANUFACTURE ORIENTED INTERNAL AND<br>
EXTERNAL GEAR MEMBERS<br>
CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/892,708 filed on March 2, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to gears, and more particularly to<br>
a method and system to manufacture oriented internal and external gear<br>
members.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical internal ring gear includes a set of outer diameter<br>
spline teeth and a set of inner diameter gear teeth. The spine teeth are formed<br>
on an outer surface of the ring gear while the gear teeth are formed on an inner<br>
diameter of the ring gear. These internal ring gears are used in various<br>
environments, many of which require a specific orientation between the outer<br>
diameter spline teeth and the inner diameter gear teeth.<br>
1<br><br>
[0005] In order to meet high volume demands, internal ring gears that<br>
have outside diameter spline teeth and internal diameter gear teeth are typically<br>
manufactured using a method wherein both the spline teeth and the gear teeth<br>
are broached on a cutting machine. However, manufacturing systems that utilize<br>
this method have not been capable of producing a gear in which the gear teeth<br>
have a specific orientation relative to the spline teeth. Accordingly, there is room<br>
in the art for an improved gear manufacturing system capable of orienting the<br>
inner diameter gear teeth with the outer diameter spline teeth.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0046] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary ring gear is designated<br>
by the reference number 10. The ring gear 10 is generally annular in shape and<br>
8<br><br>
defines an annular cavity 11. The ring gear 10 further includes an outer surface<br>
12 and an inner surface 14. A plurality of outer members or splines 16 are<br>
formed on the outer surface 12 along the outer diameter of the ring gear 10. A<br>
plurality of inner members or gear teeth 18 are formed on the inner surface 14<br>
along the inner diameter of the ring gear 10. The gear teeth 18 are formed at an<br>
angle with respect to the splines 16. The gear teeth 18 and splines 16 typically<br>
cooperate with other splines and gear teeth on other gears (not shown) to form<br>
gear sets operable to transmit torque. However, it should be appreciated that the<br>
ring gear 10 may be employed in any environment without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention. Moreover, types of gears other than ring gears<br>
may be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0048] With reference to FIG. 2, the gear teeth 18 are radially spaced<br>
with respect to the splines 16 by a radial orientation distance, indicated by<br>
reference number 20. The radial orientation 20 is measured from a center of one<br>
spline 16 to a center of one gear tooth 18, either measured as a circumferential<br>
distance or as an angle. For example, the radial orientation 20 may be<br>
measured as an angle between a radial line from the center of the spline 16 to<br>
the center of the gear 10 and a radial line from the center of the gear tooth 18 to<br>
the center of the gear 10. In the particular example provided, the radial<br>
orientation 20 is measured between adjacent splines 16 and gear teeth 18, but it<br>
should be appreciated that the radial orientation 20 may be measured from any<br>
particular spline 16 and gear tooth 18 so long as the specific spline 16 and gear<br>
tooth 18 are employed consistently throughout the manufacture of the ring gear<br>
9<br><br>
10, as will be described in greater detail below. The amount of the radial<br>
orientation 20 is governed by the specific parameters that describe the<br>
environment in which the ring gear 10 is to be employed. While in the specific<br>
example provided the ring gear 10 has inner gear teeth and outer splines, it<br>
should be appreciated that the present invention may be used to manufacture a<br>
ring gear having various combinations of inner and outer features such as outer<br>
gear teeth and inner splines, outer gear teeth and inner gear teeth, and outer<br>
splines and inner splines, each having specific radial orientations between the<br>
inner and outer features.<br>
[0049] Turning now to FIG. 3A, a gear cutting system for manufacturing<br>
the ring gear 10 having a specific radial orientation 20 described above is<br>
generally indicated by reference number 50. The gear cutting system 50<br>
includes a loading station 52. The loading station 52 includes a conveyor 54<br>
used to position a workpiece 56 underneath an orientation device 58. The<br>
workpiece 56 is similar to the ring gear 10 (FIG. 1) and includes the splines 16<br>
formed on the outer surface 12, an annular cavity 11, and an inner surface 14.<br>
However, the gear teeth 18 have not yet been formed on the inner surface 14 of<br>
the workpiece 56.<br>
[0050] The gear cutting system 50 also includes a shuttle loader 60,<br>
only part of which is shown. The shuttle loader 60 is positioned underneath the<br>
orientation device 58 and above the loading station 52. The shuttle loader 60<br>
includes a first arm 62 and a second arm 64. The first arm 62 and the second<br>
arm 64 are coupled to a housing (not shown) of the shuttle loader 60. The arms<br>
10<br><br>
62 and 64 cooperate to grip the workpiece 56, as will be described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
[0051] With reference to FIG. 3B, the orientation device 58 is, as noted<br>
above, positioned above the loading station 52. The orientation device 58<br>
includes a housing 68 having a hub 70 that extends towards the workpiece 56.<br>
The hub 70 is moveable in an axial direction, as shown by the arrows indicated<br>
by reference number 72. The hub 68 is sized to fit within the annular cavity 11 of<br>
the workpiece 56.<br>
[0052] A sensor arm 74 extends out from the housing 68 parallel to the<br>
hub 70 towards the workpiece 56 and loading station 52. A sensor 76 is located<br>
at an end of the sensor arm 74. The sensor 76 is positioned such that the sensor<br>
76 is directed towards the hub 70. The sensor 76 is preferably an optical sensor,<br>
though various other kinds of sensors may be employed. As will be described in<br>
further detail below, the sensor 76 is operable to detect the splines 16 of the<br>
workpiece 56.<br>
[0053] Turning back to FIG. 3A, the gear cutting system 50 further<br>
includes a cutting machine or station 80. The cutting station 80 is operable to<br>
form the gear teeth 18 on the inner surface 14 of the workpiece 56, as will be<br>
described in greater detail below. The cutting station 80 generally includes a<br>
work surface 82, only part of which is shown. A cutting hole 84 is formed in the<br>
work surface 82. An annular ring 86 is located around the cutting hole 84. The<br>
annular ring 86 extends out from the work surface 82 and is sized to receive the<br>
11<br><br>
workpiece 56 thereon. A loading ramp 88 extends from the cutting hole 84 out<br>
towards the loading station 52.<br>
[0054] The cutting system 50 further includes a controller 95. The<br>
controller 95 is preferably an electronic device having a preprogrammed digital<br>
computer or processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least<br>
one I/O peripheral. However, other types of controllers may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention. The controller 95 is in<br>
communication with the orientation device 58, the sensor 76, and the cutting<br>
station 80. More specifically, the controller 95 is configured to receive data<br>
signals from the 76 and to send control signals to the orientation device 58 and<br>
the cutting station 80.<br>
[0055] With reference to FIG.'s 3A-3F, a method for manufacturing the<br>
ring gear 10 using the gear cutting system 50 will now be described. First, the<br>
workpiece 56 is positioned by the conveyor 54 in the direction of the arrows<br>
indicated by reference number 55 such that the workpiece 56 is positioned<br>
underneath the orientation device 58 as seen in FIG.'s 3A and 3B. A stop 57<br>
coupled to the loading station 52 operates to position the workpiece 56<br>
underneath the orientation device 58.<br>
[0056] Next, the orientation device 58 picks up the workpiece 56 as<br>
seen in FIG.'s 3C and 3D. More specifically, the hub 70 of the orientation device<br>
58 extends down into the annular cavity 11 of the workpiece 56 such that the hub<br>
70 creates an interference fit with the workpiece 56. The hub 70 then extends<br>
back up towards the housing 68 carrying the workpiece 56 such that the<br>
12<br><br>
workpiece 56 is positioned opposite the sensor 76. The sensor 76 scans the<br>
workpiece 56 and detects the position of at least one of the splines 16. The<br>
position of the splines 16 is communicated to the controller 95. The controller 95<br>
determines an amount of rotation necessary to position the workpiece 56 relative<br>
to the cutting station 80 such that when the inner teeth 18 are cut into the gear<br>
10, the inner teeth 18 will have the desired radial orientation 20. The hub 70 of<br>
the orientation device 58 then rotates the workpiece 56 relative to the cutting<br>
station 80 the amount determined by the controller 95. The orientation device 58<br>
then lowers the workpiece 56 back onto the loading station 52. The arms 60 and<br>
62 of the shuttle loader 60 then grip the workpiece 56 and keep the workpiece 56<br>
stationary.<br>
[0057] Once the workpiece 56 has been oriented with respect to the<br>
cutting station 80, the shuttle loader 60 transfers the workpiece 56 onto the<br>
loading ramp 88 towards the cutting station 80, as seen in FIG.'s 3E and 3F. The<br>
radial orientation of the workpiece 56 is maintained during this transfer by a<br>
plurality of notches 90 and teeth 92 located on the first arm 62 of the shuttle<br>
loader 60. These notches 90 and teeth 92 cooperate with the splines 16 formed<br>
on the workpiece 56 to keep the workpiece 56 from rotating during the transfer<br>
from the loading station 52 to the cutting station 80.<br>
[0058] Turning now to FIG.'s 4A and 4B, the workpiece 56 is positioned<br>
atop the annular ring 86 by the shuttle loader 60 such that the annular cavity 11<br>
of the workpiece 56 is concentric with the cutting hole 84 of the cutting station.<br>
13<br><br>
The cutting station 80 further includes a cutting tool 100 that is used to form the<br>
gear teeth 18 (FIG. 1) on the workpiece 56.<br>
[0059] With reference to FIG.'s 5A and 5B, the cutting tool 100 includes<br>
a generally cylindrical body 102 having a head portion 104. The head portion<br>
104 includes an inclined pulling face 106. The inclined pulling face 106 acts as a<br>
locator during the cutting process along the axis of the cutting hole 84. The head<br>
portion 104 further includes drive flats 107 formed thereon. The drive flats 107<br>
are gripped by a driver (not shown) that rotates and moves the cutting tool 100<br>
during the cutting process. The cylindrical body 102 also includes a tooth cutting<br>
portion 108 at an end opposite the head portion 104. The tooth cutting portion<br>
108 includes a plurality of tooth cutting rows or edges 110. The distance<br>
between the inclined pulling face 106 and the first row of the tooth cutting rows<br>
110 is used to control the axial position of the cutting tool 100 relative to the<br>
workpiece 56. Additionally, the radial distance between the drive flats 107 and<br>
the tooth cutting rows 110 is used to control the radial position of the cutting tool<br>
100 relative to the workpiece 56.<br>
[0060] Turning back to FIG.'s 4A and 4B, the cutting tool 100 extends<br>
through the annular cavity 11 and the cutting hole 84. The cutting tool 100 is<br>
rotated and positioned by a driver (not shown) that is controlled by control signals<br>
communicated from the controller 95. The controller 95 preferably employs<br>
computer numerical control (CNC) helix generation axis software or control logic<br>
to rotate and position the cutting tool 100 relative to the workpiece 56 prior to the<br>
cutting of the gear teeth 18 by the cutting tool 100. The controller 95 controls the<br>
14<br><br>
radial orientation of the cutting tool 100 and the workpiece 56. The controller 95<br>
uses the known orientation or rotational position of the workpiece 56, the known<br>
axial distance of the tooth cutting rows 110 relative to the inclined pulling face<br>
106, and the known rotational position of the tooth cutting rows 110 relative to the<br>
drive flats 107 to rotationally position the cutting tool 100 relative to the workpiece<br>
56 prior to cutting. By knowing the orientation of the splines 16 relative to the<br>
cutting tool 100 and controlling when the cutting tool 100 begins formation of the<br>
inner gear teeth 18 (FIG. 1), the radial orientation 20 between the spines 16 and<br>
the gear teeth 18 can be specifically set.<br>
[0061] Once the cutting tool 100 has been properly positioned relative<br>
to the workpiece 56 to create the desired radial orientation 20, the cutting tool<br>
100 is rotated and moved by the driver (not shown) and the tooth cutting rows<br>
110 cut the gear teeth 18 (FIG. 1) into the inner surface 14 of the workpiece 56.<br>
When the gear teeth 18 have been formed into the workpiece 56, the cutting tool<br>
100 is retracted, the workpiece 56 is transferred by the shuttle loader 60 back to<br>
the loading station 52 where the workpiece 56 is removed from the gear cutting<br>
system 50 by the conveyor 54.<br>
[0062] Turning now to FIG.'s 6A-C, a second gear cutting system is<br>
generally indicated by reference number 200. The second gear cutting system<br>
200 is similar to the gear cutting system 50 and includes a loading station 202, a<br>
shuttle loader 204, a cutting station 206, and a controller 207. However, the<br>
second gear cutting system 200 does not include the orientation device 58.<br>
Instead, the second gear cutting system 200 includes a plurality of sensors 208<br>
15<br><br>
mounted on an annular ring 210. The sensors 208 are in communication with the<br>
controller 207. While in the particular example provided two sensors 208 are<br>
employed, it should be appreciated that any number of sensors 208 may be used<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0063] The method of manufacturing the ring gear 10 using the second<br>
gear cutting system 200 begins as the workpiece 56 is positioned by the loading<br>
station 202 into the shuttle loader 204, as shown in FIG. 6A. Next, the shuttle<br>
loader 204 grips the workpiece 56 and moves the workpiece 56 onto a loading<br>
ramp 212 of the cutting station 206, as shown in FIG. 6B. Finally, the workpiece<br>
56 is positioned onto the annular ring 210 of the cutting station 206, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6C. The sensors 208 are positioned such that they are able to sense or<br>
scan the orientation or rotational position of the outer splines 16 of the workpiece<br>
56. The controller 207 then determines an amount of rotation necessary to<br>
create the desired radial orientation 20 based on the rotational position of the<br>
outer splines 16 and the rotational position of the cutting rows 110 on the cutting<br>
tool 100. The controller 207 then rotates the cutting tool 100 the determined<br>
amount necessary to create the radial orientation 20 between the outer splines<br>
16 and the inner gear teeth 18. Cutting of the inner gear teeth 18 then proceeds<br>
in a manner similar to that described for the gear cutting system 50.<br>
[0064] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
