				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fungicides that effectively control plant diseases are in constant demand by growers. Plant diseases are highly destructive, difficult to control and quickly develop resistance to commercial fungicides. Combinations of pesticides are often used to facilitate disease control, to broaden spectrum of control and to retard resistance development. It is recognized in the art that the advantages of particular pesticide combinations can often vary, depending on such factors as the particular plant and plant disease to be treated, and the treatment conditions. Accordingly, there is an ongoing search for advantageous combinations of pesticides.<br>

When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g., (R)i_j, then the number of substituents may be selected from the integers between ii and j inclusive.<br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R4, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted. When a group is optionally substituted with a substituent, for example with R7, then, when the group is not substituted with that substituent, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group having a hydrogen substituent.<br>
Compounds used in this invention often can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers.

Methyl (£)-a-(methoxyimino)-2-[(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]benzeneacetate is described as a bc\ complex inhibitor in Biochemical Society Transactions 1993, 22, 64S. (£)-2-[(2,5-<br>
Dimemylphenoxy)memyl]-a-(methoxyuTiino)-Mmethylbenzeneacetamide is described asa&amp;ci complex inhibitor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology 1995,55(3), 306-311.<br>
The be i complex is sometimes referred to by other names in the biochemical literature, including complex III of the electron transfer chain, and ubihydroquinonexytochrome c oxidoreductase. It is uniquely identified by the Enzyme Commission number ECl. 10.2.2. The bc\ complex is described in, for example, J. Biol Chem. 1989, 264,14543-38; Methods Enzymol 1986,126, 253-71; and references cited therein. The Sterol Biosynthesis Inhibitor Fungicides<br>
The class of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors includes DMI and non-DMI compounds, that control fungi by inhibiting enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. DMI fungicides have a common site: of action within the fungal sterol biosynthesis pathway; that is, an inhibition of demethylation at position 14 of lanosterol or 24-methylene dihydrolanosterol, which are precursors to sterols in fungi. Compounds acting at this site are often referred to as demethylase inhibitors, DMI fungicides, or DMIs. The demethylase enzyme is sometimes referred to by other names in the biochemical literature, including cytochrome P-450 (14DM). The demethylase enzyme is described in, for example, J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267,13175-79 and references cited therein. DMI fungicides fall into several classes: triazoles, imidazoles, pyrimidines,<br><br>
piperazines and pyridines. The triazoles includes bromuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole, epoxiconazole, fenbuconazole, fluquinconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, hexaconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, penconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triticonazole and uniconazole. The imidazoles include clotrimazole, econazole, imazalil, isoconazole, miconazole and prochloraz. The pyrimidines include fenarimol, nuarimol and triarimol. .   The piperazines include triforine. The pyridines include buthiobate and pyrifenox. Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned fungicides are DMI fungicides as described by K. H. Kuck, et al. in Modern Selective Fungicides -Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, Lyr, H., Ed.; Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 205-258.<br>
The DMI fungicides have been grouped together to distinguish them from other sterol biosynthesis inhibitors, such as, the morpholine and piperidine fungicides. The morpholines and piperidines are also sterol biosynthesis inhibitors but have been shown to inhibit later steps in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. The morpholines include aldimorph, dodemorph, fenpropimorph, tridemorph and trimorphamide. The piperidines include fenpropidin. Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned morpholine and piperidine fungicides are sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicides as described by K. H. Kuck, et al. in Modern Selective Fungicides -Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, Lyr, H., Ed.; Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 185-204. Synergistic Effects<br>
Fungicides that effectively control plant fungi, particularly wheat powdery mildew {Erysiphe graminis) and wheat foot rot {Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides), are in constant demand by growers. Combinations of fungicides are often used to facilitate disease control and to retard resistance development. Mixtures of fungicides may provide significantly better disease control than could be predicted based on the activity of the individual components. This synergism has been described as "the cooperative action of two components of a mixture, such that the total effect is greater or more prolonged than the sum of the effects of the two (or more) taken independently" (see Tames, P. M. L., Neth. J. Plant Pathology, (1964), 70, 73-80). It has been demonstrated that compositions containing compounds of Formula la and Formula Ha; Formula la and flusilazole; Formula la and tebuconazole; and Formula la, Formula Ila and flusilazole exhibit synergistic effects.<br>
The presence of a synergistic effect between two active ingredients is established with the aid of the Colby equation (see Colby, S. R. In Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations, Weeds, (1967), 15, 20-22):<br><br>
21<br><br>
Ax B<br>
p=A+B-<br>
100<br>
Using the methods of the Colby, the presence of a synergistic interaction between two active ingredients is established.by first calculating the predicted activity, p, of the mixture based on activities of the two components applied alone. If p is lower than the experimentally established effect, synergism has occurred. In the equation above, A is the fungicidal activity in percentage control of one component applied alone at rate x. The B term is the fungicidal activity in percentage control of the second component applied at rate y. The equation estimates p, the fungicidal activity of the mixture of A at rate x with B at rate y if their effects are strictly additive and no interaction has occurred.<br>
The Colby equation for a three way mixture is<br><br>
p = A + B + C+ AxBxC . 10000<br>
(A x B) + (A x O + (B x C) 100<br>

Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
The compounds of Formula I where D is O can be prepared as described in International Patent Application WO 94/26722 and as shown in Scheme 1.<br>
An anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid) of Formula 1 is condensed with an isothiocyanate of Formula R!-NCS to form the 2-thioquinazolinedione of Formula 2. This condensation is preferably performed in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. S-Methylation of this compound affords the 2-methylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula 3.<br>
For the introduction of the R2O group, the 2-methylthio-4(3//)-quinazolinone of Formula 3 is treated with a mixture of a base, for example sodium hydride, in R2OH solvent. The reaction mixture is stirred at a temperature from about 0 °C to 120 °C for 1-120 hours. The desired 2-R2O-4(3H)-quinazoIinone can be isolated from the reaction mixture by extraction into a water-immiscible solvent, and purified by chromatography or recrystallization. Similar synthetic procedures are described in U.S. 3,755,582, incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>

Scheme 1<br>
Anthranilic acids of Formula 1 are known or can be prepared by known methods. For example see, March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; 3rd ed., John Wiley: New York, (1985), p 983. The isothiocyanates of Formula Rl-NCS can be prepared from the corresponding amine by treatment with thiophosgene as known in the art. For example, see*/. Heterocycl Chem.t (1990), 27,407.<br>

Synthesis of Compounds of Formula II<br>
Compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-l and X is OR11 can be prepared as described in International Patent Application WO 95/14009 by treating a compound of Formula 4 with an appropriate alkyl transfer reagent in an inert solvent with or without additional acidic or basic reagents or other reagents (Scheme 2). Suitable solvents are selected from the group consisting of polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, or diethyl ether; ketones such as acetone or 2-butanone; hydrocarbons such as toluene or benzene; and halocarbons such as dichloromethane or chloroform.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
For example, compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-l and X is OR1* can be prepared by the action of diazoalkane reagents of Formula 5 such as diazomethane (V = H) or trimethylsilyldiazomethane (V = (CH3)3Si) on of Formula 4 (Method 1). Use of trimethylsilyldiazomethane requires a protic cosolvent such as methanol. For examples of these procedures, see Chem. Pharm. Bull., (1984), 32, 3759.<br>
As indicated in Method 2, compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-l and X is OR1 ] can also be prepared by contacting compounds of Formula 4 with alkyl<br><br>
29<br>
trichloroacetimidates of Formula 6 and a Lewis acid catalyst. Suitable Lewis acids include trimethylsilyl triflate and tetrafluoroboric acid. The alkyl trichloroacetimidates can be prepared from the appropriate alcohol and trichloroacetonitrile as described in the literature (J. Danklmaier and H. Honig, Synth. Commun., (1990), 20, 203).<br>
Compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-l and X is OR1} can also be prepared from compounds of Formula 4 by treatment with a trialkyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (i.e., Meerwein's salt) of Formula 7 (Method 3). The use of trialkyloxonium salts as powerful alkylating agents is well known in the art (see U. SchoTlkopf, U. Groth, C. Deng, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed EngL, (1981), 20, 798).<br>
Other alkylating agents which can convert compounds of Formula 4 to compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-1 and X is OR1 * are dialkyl sulfates such as dimethyl sulfate, haloalkyl sulfonates such as methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and alkyl halides such as iodomethane and propargyl bromide (Method 4). These alkylations can be conducted with or without additional base. Appropriate bases include alkali metal alkoxides such as potassium terf-butoxide, inorganic bases such as sodium hydride and potassium carbonate, or tertiary amines such as triethylamine, pyridine, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and triethylenediamine. See R. E. Benson, T. L. Caims, J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1948), 70,2115 for alkylation examples using agents of this type.<br>
Compounds of Formula II where Q is Q-1 and X is OR11 can also be prepared by reaction of Formula 8 compounds with alkali metal alkoxides (R1 ^"M"1") (Scheme 3). The leaving group Lg1 in the amides of Formula 8 are any group known in the art to undergo a displacement reaction of this type. Examples of suitable leaving groups include chlorine, bromine, and sulfonyl and sulfonate groups. Examples of suitable inert solvents are dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide.<br>

The fungicidal c ompositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of a mixture of the compounds(s) of component (1) (e.g., 6-iodo-3-propyl-2-propyloxy-4(3i/)-quinazolinone) and the compound(s) of component (2) (e.g., 2,4-dihydro-5-methoxy-2-methyl-4-[2-[[[[l-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethyhdene]amino]oxy]methyl]phenyl]-3i/-l,2,4-triazol-3-one, kresoxim-methyl, azoxystrobin, (£}-2-(methoxyimino)-A/-methyl-2-(2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide, flusilazole, epoxiconazole, fenpropimorph, propiconazole and/or tebuconazole). The mixtures of this invention will typically be used as a formulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition<br><br>
31<br>
ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemuisions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredients, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. McCutcheon's Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual, Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth and the like, or thickeners to increase viscosity. Surfactants include, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, dialkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, organosilicones, MAT-dialkyltaurates, lignin<br><br>
32<br>
sulfonates, naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, polycarboxylates, and polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers. Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, starch, sugar, silica, talc, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, A^-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, Malkylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, oils of olive, castor, linseed, tung, sesame, corn, peanut, cotton-seed, soybean, rape-seed and coconut, fatty acid esters, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, and alcohols such as methanol, cyclohexanol, decanol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.<br>
Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill. Suspensions are usually prepared by wet-milling; see, for example, U.S. 3,060,084. Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp 147-48, Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, pages 8-57 and following, and International Patent Publication WO 91/13546. Pellets can be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,172,714. Water-dispersible and water-soluble granules can be prepared as taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,144,050, U.S. Patent No. 3,920,442 and German Patent Application DE 3,246,493.

Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of the composition of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruit, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The composition can also be applied to the seed to protect the seed and seedling.<br>
Rates of application for this composition can be influenced by many factors of the environment and should be determined under actual use conditions. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than 1 g/ha to 5,000 g/ha of aggregate active ingredient. Aggregate active ingredient is defined as the total combined weight of active ingredients. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from 0.1 to 10 g of aggregate active ingredient per kilogram of seed.<br>
