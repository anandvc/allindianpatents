DESCRIPTION<br>
MULTILAYER OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND OPTICAL<br>
RECORDING METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a multilayer optical<br>
medium (hereinafter, also sometimes referred to as "multilayer<br>
phase change information recording medium", "multilayer phase<br>
change optical recording medium", "multilayer optical disc" and a<br>
"multilayer phase change optical disc) capable of recording the<br>
information by causing optical change in a recording layer material<br>
by irradiation of laser light and having, multiple recording layers<br>
containing a phase change recording layer capable of rewriting the<br>
information, and an optical recording method in the optical<br>
recording medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
In phase change optical discs (phase change optical<br>
recording media) such as CD-RW, generally a basic constitution is<br>
made by providing a recording layer composed of a phase change<br>
material on a plastic substrate and thereon forming a reflection<br>
layer which enhances an optical absorption ratio of the recording<br>
layer and has a thermal diffusion effect, and the information is<br>
recorded and replayed by irradiating the laser light from a<br><br>
substrate side.<br>
Phase change recording materials exhibit the phase change<br>
between a crystalline state and an amorphous state by heating<br>
with laser light irradiation followed by cooling. When rapidly<br>
cooled after rapid heating, they become amorphous whereas when<br>
slowly cooled, they are crystallized. The phase change recording<br>
medium practically applies this nature to record and replay of the<br>
information.<br>
Additionally, for the purpose of blocking oxidation,<br>
transpiration and deformation of the recording layer which occur<br>
by heating with light irradiation, typically a lower protection layer<br>
is provided between the substrate and the recording layer, and an<br>
upper protection layer is provided between the recording layer and<br>
the reflection layer. These protection layers have regulation<br>
functions of optical properties of the optical recording medium, and<br>
the lower protection layer also combines with the function to<br>
prevent the substrate from softening due to the heat when recorded<br>
in the recording layer.<br>
In recent years, along with the increase of information<br>
amounts covered by computers, signal recording capacities of<br>
rewritable type discs such as DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and DVD+RW<br>
have been increased, and density growth of signal information has<br>
been advanced. The recording capacity of current CD is about 650<br><br>
MB, that of DVD is about 4.7 GB, and it is forecasted that the<br>
density growth of the recording is highly required in the future.<br>
Along with the increase of the information amounts, it appears to<br>
also require enhancement of a recording speed. At present, as the<br>
rewritable DVD disc, those capable of recording 8 times faster in a<br>
monolayer have been developed and practically applied.<br>
As methods to increase the recording density using such a<br>
phase change optical recording medium, for example, shortening<br>
the laser wavelength used to a blue color area, or enlarging a<br>
numeric aperture NA of an objective lens used for pickup which<br>
performs record and replay to reduce a spot size of the laser light<br>
irradiated to the optical recording medium has been proposed,<br>
researched, developed and almost come into practical use.<br>
As the method to increase the recording capacity by<br>
improving the optical recording medium itself, various types of<br>
dual layer phase change optical recording media made by<br>
overlapping two information layers composed of at least the<br>
recording layer and the reflection layer at one side of the substrate<br>
and adhering these information layers with ultraviolet ray-curable<br>
resins have been proposed. A separation layer (sometimes<br>
referred to as an intermediate layer) which is an adhered portion<br>
between these information layers has the function to optically<br>
separate two information layers, and made up of a material which<br><br>
does not absorb the laser light as possible because it is necessary<br>
that the laser light used for the record and replay attains<br>
abundantly as possible to the information layer at an inner side.<br>
There are still many problems for this dual layer phase<br>
change optical recording medium.<br>
For example, if the laser light is not sufficiently transmitted<br>
through the information layer (first information layer) at a front<br>
side as seen from the side of laser light irradiation, the information<br>
can not be recorded in the recording layer of the information layer<br>
(second information layer) at the inner side and can not be<br>
replayed. Thus, the reflection layer which constitutes the first<br>
information layer must be an ultrathin translucent reflection layer.<br>
To replay, a high reflectance ratio as possible is required.<br>
However, in the optical recording medium having two layers or<br>
more of the recording layers and the reflection layers, their optical<br>
absorption and optical transmission affect, and the reflectance<br>
ratio of the optical recording medium itself becomes low.<br>
Recording in the phase change optical recording medium is<br>
performed by irradiating the laser light for a very short time to the<br>
phase change material in the recording layer followed by rapid<br>
cooling to change the crystal to the amorphous and form a mark.<br>
Thus, in the case of the translucent reflection layer with a very<br>
thin thickness of about 10 nm, a radiator effect become excessively<br><br>
small compared with the optical recording medium having the<br>
monolayer. Therefore, it becomes difficult to form amorphous<br>
marks when recorded in the recording layer of the first information<br>
layer. As a result, a modulation degree is hardly assured.<br>

nm is emphasized, only the special effect of using ITO for the<br>
thermal diffusion layer is described, and this is different from the<br>
present invention in constitution.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Multilayer optical recording medium)<br><br>
A multilayer optical recording medium of the present<br>
invention has multiple information layers contains at least a phase<br>
change recording layer capable of recording information by laser<br>
irradiation and a reflection layer, wherein each information layer<br>
other than the innermost information layer as seen from a side of<br>
the laser irradiation has at least a lower protection layer, the<br>
phase change recording layer, an upper protection layer, the<br>
reflection layer and an optical transmission layer, and further if<br>
necessary has the other layers.<br>
Here, FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a dual layer<br>
optical recording medium according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. This dual layer optical recording medium<br>
laminates a first information layer 1, an intermediate layer 4, a<br>
second information layer 2 and a second substrate 5 in this order<br>
on a first substrate 3, and further if necessary has the other layers.<br>
The first information layer 1 has a first lower protection<br>
layer 11, a first phase change recording layer 12, a first upper<br>
protection layer 13, a first reflection layer 14 and a first optical<br>
transmission layer 15.<br>
The second information layer 2 has a second lower<br>
protection layer 21, a second phase change recording layer 22, a<br>
second upper protection layer 23, and a second reflection layer 24.<br>
An interface layer may be provided at least any of between<br><br>
tlie first upper protection layer 13 and the first reflection layer 14,<br>
and between the second upper protection layer 23 and the second<br>
reflection layer 24.<br>
In the dual layer optical recording medium, the information<br>
layer at the innermost side as seen from the side of the laser<br>
irradiation is the second information layer, and the information<br>
layer other than the innermost one as seen from the side of the<br>
laser irradiation is the first information layer.<br>
Such a dual layer phase change optical recording medium is<br>
preferably produced as follows. That is, a production method<br>
composed of a film forming step, an initializing step and a cohering<br>
step is employed and performed basically in this order.<br>
In the film forming step, the film of the first information<br>
layer is formed on the surface provided with a group of the first<br>
substrate, and the film of the second information layer is formed on<br>
the surface provided with a group of the second substrate.<br>
Respective film layers of the first information layer and the<br>
second information layer can be formed by various vapor-phase<br>
growth methods, e.g., a vacuum vapor deposition method, a<br>
spattering method, a plasma CVD method, an optical CVD method,<br>
an ion plating method, and an electron beam vapor deposition<br>
method. Among them, the spattering method is excellent in mass<br>
productivity and film nature. In the spattering method, the film<br><br>
is generally formed with flowing an inert gas such as argon, and at<br>
that time the reaction spattering may be performed with<br>
mixing/adding oxygen or nitrogen.<br>
In the initializing step, the entire layer is initialized<br>
(recording layer is crystallized) by irradiating energy light such as<br>
laser light to the first information layer and the second<br>
information layer. When it is likely that the film is buoyed by<br>
laser light energy, an overcoat may be given by spin coating an UV<br>
resin (ultraviolet ray curable resin) on the first and second<br>
information layers and irradiating the ultraviolet ray to cure the<br>
rein before the initializing step. After performing the subsequent<br>
cohering step in advance, the first and second information layers<br>
may be initialized from the side of the first substrate.<br>
In the cohering step, the first information layer and the<br>
second information layer are faced each other and the first<br>
substrate and the second substrate are pasted via the intermediate<br>
layer. For example, the UV resin is applied on any one film<br>
surface, the film surfaces are faced each other, to which pressure is<br>
applied to cohere, and the ultraviolet ray can be irradiated to cure<br>
the resin.<br>
In the optical recording medium having two layers of the<br>
information layers as the above, the reflectance ratio becomes low<br>
because the layer number is many compared with the monolayer<br><br>
optical recording medium and particularly optical absorption in the<br>
recording layer and the reflection layer is affected. When the<br>
reflectance ratio is low, an amplitude of replay signals is small.<br>
Thus, it becomes very difficult to continue focusing the laser light<br>
along a slit in the substrate.<br>
Thus, as an indicator whether the information can be<br>
replayed or not even at low reflectance ratio, a value of "reflectance<br>
ratio Itop x modulation degree M" (unit- %) is used. The larger<br>
this value is, the better the recording performance of the optical<br>
recording medium, is.<br>
When Itop is a crystalline reflectance ratio after recording<br>
in the first information layer and Ibot is an amorphous reflectance<br>
ratio after recording in the first information layer, the modulation<br>
degree M is represented by (Itop -Ibot) / Itop.<br>
The modulation degree M is preferably 0.55 or more and<br>
more preferably 0.55 to 0.70. When the modulation degree is less<br>
than 0.55, it sometimes becomes difficult to read out the signals<br>
with good quality in the multilayer phase change optical recording<br>
medium having the reflectance ratio about one third lower than<br>
that in the monolayer phase change optical recording medium<br>
because the amplitude of replay signals is not assured.<br>
Here, the reflectance ratio of the optical recording medium<br>
can be measured, for example, measuring a reflection intensity of<br><br>
the medium using an evaluating machine for the optical recording<br>
medium and calibrating the reflection intensity to the reflectance<br>
ratio using the reflectance ratio of a metal thin film (e.g., Ag etc.)<br>
for the calibration and the reflection intensity.<br>
The light transmittance of the first information layer after<br>
the initialization is preferably 30% to 60% and more preferably<br>
40% to 45%. When the light transmittance is less than 30%, it<br>
sometimes becomes difficult to stably record and replay in the<br>
inner information layer because the laser light hardly transmits<br>
through the inner information layer as seen from the side of laser<br>
irradiation and the reflectance ratio in the inner side is lowered.<br>
When it exceeds 60%, it sometimes becomes difficult to stably,<br>
record and replay the information because the light transmittance<br>
is too high, thus the laser intensity required for recording the<br>
information in the first information layer becomes too high and the<br>
reflectance ratio in the first information layer becomes low.<br>
Here, the light transmittance in the first information layer<br>
can be measured by measuring the first information layer by<br>
Etha-optics supplied from Steag before pasting the two layers.<br>
As recording layer materials used for the present invention,<br>
those containing around 70% Sb are preferable. In the optical<br>
recording medium having the dual layer recording layer, the high<br>
transmittance is required in the first information layer when<br><br>
considering the record and replay in the second information layer.<br>
Therefor, it is required to thin the film in the recording layer in<br>
parallel with an activity to reduce the absorption ratio of the<br>
reflection layer. It is publicly known that thinning the recording<br>
layer reduces a crystallization speed, and it is advantageous that<br>
the recording layer material itself having the high crystallization<br>
speed is used. Thus, an SbTe eutectic composition containing<br>
around 70% Sb content is preferable. Specific examples include<br>
Ge-Sb-Te, In-Sb-Te, Ag-In-Sb-Te, Ge-In-Sb-Te, Ag-Ge-In-Sb-Te, and<br>
Ge-Sn-Sb-Te. As phase change recording materials other than<br>
these, Ge-Te, In-Sb, Ga-Sb, Ge-Sb and In-Sb-Ge can be used.<br>
The thickness of the first phase change recording layer is<br>
preferably in the range of 5 nm to 10 nm, and the thickness of the<br>
second phase change recording layer is preferably in the range of<br>
10 nm to 20 nm<br>
Film forming methods for the recording layer include<br>
various vapor-phase growth methods, e.g., a vacuum vapor<br>
deposition method, a spattering method, a plasma CVD method, an<br>
optical CVD method, an ion plating method, and an electron beam<br>
vapor deposition method. Among them, the spattering method is<br>
excellent in mass productivity and film nature.<br>
To easily perform the recording in the information layer<br>
containing such a phase change recording layer, it is necessary to<br><br>
rapidly release remaining heat produced by the light irradiated for<br>
forming amorphous marks.<br>
However, the thickness of the first reflection layer can be<br>
thickened up to only about 10 nm in association with the light<br>
transmittance of the first information layer. Thus the heat<br>
release property is poor and the recording in the first recording<br>
layer is hardly performed. In particular, the modulation degree is<br>
low. Thus, in order to enhance the heat release property,<br>
transparent materials having good thermal conductivity are used<br>
for the first upper protection layer and the optical transmission<br>
layer.<br>
. That is, by constituting the .first upper protection layer and<br>
the optical transmission layer in the first information layer<br>
(corresponding to the information layer other than the innermost<br>
one as seen from the side of the laser irradiation) with the layer<br>
containing the Sn oxide, it is possible to increase the recording<br>
sensitivity of the first information layer and enhance the<br>
modulation degree by a relatively low recording power. In the<br>
conventional monolayer rewritable optical recording medium,<br>
ZnS-SiC&gt;2 is mainly used for the upper protection layer. However,<br>
in the rewritable optical recording medium having the dual layer<br>
information layers, the storage stability can not be assured when<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is used for the upper protection layer of the information<br><br>
layer.at the front side as seen from the side of the laser irradiation.<br>
However, according to the present invention, the new<br>
problem in the optical recording medium having the above dual<br>
layer information layers can be solved. Furthermore, since the<br>
light transmittance in the first information layer can be increased,<br>
the light is easily transmitted through the information layer at the<br>
inner side and the recording sensitivity in the second information<br>
layer can be enhanced.<br>
It is preferable that the first upper protection layer contains<br>
50 mol% or more Sn oxide. When the Sn oxide content is less than<br>
50 mol%, the sufficient crystallization speed is hardly obtained in<br>
the first recording, layer and repeated recording at high line speed<br>
of about 10 m/s in the first information layer becomes difficult.<br>
Thus, a jitter when repeatedly recorded 10 times (DOW 10 jitter) is<br>
also deteriorated (see FIG. 8 described later). Furthermore, to<br>
easily obtain the excellent storage stability, it is preferable to make<br>
the content of Sn oxide 90 mol% or less (see FIG. 11 described later).<br>
That is, as shown in FIGs. 8 and 11, to balance the recording<br>
property of DOW 10 jitter 10% or less and the storage stability of<br>
DOW 10 jitter change amount less than 1%, the content of Sn oxide<br>
is preferably in the range of 50 mol% to 90 mol% and more<br>
preferably 50 mol% to 70 mol%.<br>
Here, the "transfer line speed" shown in FIG. 8 refers to the<br><br>
line speed at which the reflectance ratio begins to change when<br>
continuous light (power was 15 mff) is irradiated to a track which<br>
is in the crystalline state due to the initialization with changing<br>
the line speed of the recording medium. In an example in FIG. 9<br>
(example of experimenting with a medium having a layer<br>
constitution used in Example 2), the transfer line speed is 15 m/s<br>
as shown by an arrow. The transfer line speed is an alternative<br>
value of the crystallization speed in the recording layer and is an<br>
important design issue for accomplishing the objective recording<br>
speed.<br>
As described above, in JP-A No. 2002-298433, it has been<br>
described to use the material selected from A1N, Al203, SiaN4, SiC&gt;2,<br>
Ta2O5, TaO, ZrO2, ZnO, TiO2, SiC and composite materials thereof<br>
for the transparent heat release layer (optical transmission layer).<br>
However, in any cases, the Itop x M value is low because the<br>
modulation degree is hardly taken. There is also a problem in<br>
that the transmittance is hardly assured.<br>
In the present invention, by the use of the dielectric<br>
material containing Sn oxide for the optical transmission layer, it<br>
is possible to increase the modulation degree and assure the high<br>
light transmittance. In203, ZnO, Ta20s, and SiO2 and the like<br>
may be added in addition to Sn oxide.<br>
When Sn oxide is used for the first lower protection layer,<br><br>
the first upper protection layer and the optical transmission layer,<br>
the thickness of the optical transmission layer is preferably in the<br>
range of 51 nm to 250 nm and more preferably 55 nm to 70 nm.<br>
When the thickness is less than 51 nm, no sufficient heat release<br>
effect is obtained to make the recording difficult. When it exceeds<br>
250 nm, the sufficient heat release effect is obtained, but the light<br>
transmittance is lowered and the recording sensitivity in the<br>
second information layer becomes poor, which is not preferable.<br>
When the thickness is set up in the above range, it is possible to<br>
make the light transmittance 40% to 60%. In JP-A No.<br>
2002-298433, it is described that it is preferable that the thickness<br>
is 50 nm or less in the case of using the materials described above<br>
as the transparent heat release layer (corresponding to the optical<br>
transmission layer of the present invention), but the heat release<br>
property is insufficient in such a thin film.<br>
For the second upper protection layer, Sn oxide may be used,<br>
and ZnS-SiC&gt;2 may also be used as conventional. When recorded<br>
in the second phase change recording layer, the second reflection<br>
layer can be made sufficiently thick to obtain the sufficient heat<br>
release property, and thus, ZnS-SiC&gt;2 may be used. But, when<br>
ZnS-SiC-2 is used for the second upper protection layer and Ag is<br>
used for the second reflection layer, it is preferable that the<br>
interface layer composed of TIG (70 mol%)-TiO2 (30 mol%) is<br><br>
sandwiched with them. This is for preventing that reliability of<br>
the medium is inhibited by reacting Ag and S.<br>
The thickness of the second upper protection layer is<br>
typically preferably about 3 nm to 30 nra and more preferably 15<br>
nm to 30 nm.<br>
The first lower protection layer is preferably composed of<br>
the material which is transparent, passes the light well, and whose<br>
melting point is higher than that of the recording layer. Metal<br>
oxide, nitride, sulfide and carbide which have actions of preventing<br>
deterioration and modification of the recording layer, enhancing<br>
adhesion strength to the recording layer and enhancing the<br>
recording property are primarily used. Specific	examples<br>
include metal oxide such as SiO, SiO2, ZnO, SnC&gt;2, Al203, TiO2,<br>
ln203, MgO and ZrO2, nitride such as Si3N4, AlN, TiN, BN and ZrN,<br>
sulfide such as ZnS, L12S3 and TaS4, carbide such as SiC, TaC, B4C,<br>
WC, TiC and ZrC, diamond like carbon, and mixtures thereof.<br>
These materials may be used alone or in mixture of one another.<br>
Impurities may also be contained as needed<br>
As the lower protection layer in the conventional first<br>
information layer, ZnS-SiC&gt;2 is often used as shown in JP"A No.<br>
2002-298433, and in that case, a mixed ratio is preferably ZnS (80<br>
mol%)-SiO2 (20 mol%). Since this material has a high refraction<br>
index n and an extinction coefficient k of almost zero, it is possible<br><br>
to increase absorption efficiency of the light in the recording layer,<br>
and since the thermal conductivity is small, it is possible to<br>
appropriately inhibit the diffusion of the heat produced by the<br>
optical absorption. Therefore, the temperature of the recording<br>
layer can be raised up to the temperature capable of being melted.<br>
However, in the present invention, by making not only the<br>
first upper protection layer and the optical transmission layer but<br>
also the first lower protection layer Sn oxide, it is also possible to<br>
enhance the recording sensitivity. The first lower protection layer<br>
may also be made into a dual layer laminate structure. In that<br>
case, one layer of two layers could be composed of the material<br>
whose major component is Sn oxide.<br>
The thickness of the first lower protection layer is<br>
preferably 40 nm to 80 nm and more preferably 60 nm to 80 nm.<br>
The thickness of the first upper protection layer may be<br>
typically about 2 nm to 30 nm, but in order to obtain not only the<br>
recording property but also the excellent storage stability, it is<br>
necessary to make 2 nm to 15 nm. When the thickness is thicker<br>
than 15 nm, no excellent storage stability is obtained (see FIG. 10<br>
described later). When it is thinner than 2 nm, the storage<br>
stability is obtained, but the reflectance ratio becomes high and the<br>
modulation degree can not be assured (see FIG. 17 described later).<br>
The recording property when Sn oxide has been used or has<br><br>
not been used for the optical transmission layer, the first upper<br>
protection layer and the first lower protection layer in the first<br>
information layer will be described with reference to FIGs. 6 and 7<br>
in Examples described later.<br>
The second lower protection layer is preferably formed of<br>
the material which is transparent, passes the light well and has<br>
the melting point higher than that of the recording layer. The<br>
material has actions of preventing deterioration and modification<br>
of the recording layer, enhancing the adhesive strength to the<br>
recording layer and enhancing the recording property. As such a<br>
material, metal oxide, nitride, sulfide and carbide are mainly used.<br>
Specific examples include metal oxide such as SiO, SiO2, ZnO,<br>
SnC&gt;2, Al203, TiO2, In203, MgO and ZrC&gt;2, nitride such as Si3N4, A1N,<br>
TiN, BN and ZrN, sulfide such as ZnS, In2S3 and TaS4, carbide such<br>
as SiC, TaC, B4C, WC, TiC and ZrC, diamond like carbon, and<br>
mixtures thereof. These materials can be used alone to form the<br>
protection film, but the mixture of one another may also form the<br>
protection film. Impurities may also be contained as needed.<br>
Examples of the mixture include ZnS-SiCb by mixing ZnS<br>
and SiO2 and Ta20s_SiO2 by mixing Ta20s and SiO2- In particular,<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is often used, and in that case, the mixture ratio (molar<br>
ratio) of (ZnS)so(SiO2)2o is the most preferable. In this material,<br>
the reflection index n is high, the extinction coefficient k is almost<br><br>
zero, the absorption efficiency of the light in the recording layer<br>
can he enhanced and the diffusion of the heat produced by optical<br>
absorption can be properly inhibited because the thermal<br>
conductivity is small. Thus, the material can raise the<br>
temperature up to the temperature capable of melting the<br>
recording layer.<br>
Typically, the thickness of the second lower protection layer<br>
is preferably about 110 nm to 160 nm.<br>
The film forming methods for the above protection layer<br>
include various vapor-phase growth methods, e.g., a vacuum vapor<br>
deposition method, a spattering method, a plasma CVD method, an<br>
optical CVD method, an ion plating method, and an electron beam<br>
vapor deposition method. Among them, the spattering method is<br>
excellent in mass productivity and film nature.<br>
Furthermore, by containing Cu as a major component in the<br>
first reflection layer, it becomes possible to make the transmittance<br>
in the first information layer and the recording property and the<br>
storage property in the first recording layer better. Here,<br>
containing Cu as the major component in the first reflection layer<br>
means that Cu is contained at 95% by mass or more.<br>
Reasons whey the first reflection layer mainly composed of<br>
Cu is suitable will be described below.<br>
In the phase change optical recording medium having the<br><br>
dual layer recording layer as in FIG. 1, it is necessary that the<br>
laser light for record and replay is transmitted through the first<br>
information layer as much as possible to reach the second<br>
information layer. Therefore, as an issue to be considered in the<br>
case of the first reflection layer, the material in which the light is<br>
hardly absorbed and is easily transmitted is preferable in the first<br>
reflection layer.<br>
Thus, the present inventors optically measured various<br>
reflection layer films at a wavelength of 600 nm. Here, A<br>
(absorption ratio), R (reflectance ratio) and T (transmittance) were<br>
measured. Samples for the measurement were obtained by<br>
forming each metal film with a thickness of 10 nm on a ..<br>
polycarbonate substrate with a thickness of 0.6 mm.<br>
The results were as shown in FIG. 2. From these results,<br>
Pt, Pd and Ti have the low transmittance and the high absorption<br>
ratio, and thus are predicted not to be preferable as the first<br>
reflection layer.<br>
Subsequently, for Ag and Cu which have the relatively high<br>
transmittance and the relatively low absorption ratio, the<br>
measurement was performed by changing the thickness, and the<br>
results shown in FIGs. 3 and 4 were obtained. It was found that<br>
the change due to the thickness was larger in Ag. From this, it<br>
has been shown that the stability of the optical coefficient for the<br><br>
thickness when formed into the film is more excellent in Cu.<br>
When C/N (ratio of carrier to noise) of 3T for the laser light at a<br>
wavelength of 660 nm used in DVD media was measured using Ag,<br>
Cu and Au, it was found that Cu was the most excellent.<br>
Furthermore, the results of a spectral transmittance<br>
measured when the thickness was 8 nm are shown in FIG. 5, and it<br>
has been shown that the transmittances of Ag and Cu are<br>
intersected in the wavelength area of about 450 nm. From this, it<br>
has been found that Cu has higher transmittance in the<br>
wavelength area longer than about 450 nm and that Cu is more<br>
suitable as the first reflection layer for the laser light around 660<br>
nm.<br>
In order to make the storage property better, a small<br>
amount of metal elements at 5.0% by mass or less may be added to<br>
Cu in the first reflection layer. As the small amount of the metal<br>
elements, at least one selected from Mo, Ta, Nb, Cr, Zr, Ni, Ge and<br>
Au is preferable. In this case, it is possible to make the storage<br>
property better without deteriorating the recording property<br>
compared with the use of Cu alone.<br>
Ta and Nb are the metals which have strong affinity with<br>
oxygen and nitrogen, and are sometimes used as getter materials<br>
for oxygen and nitrogen. Originally, the deterioration of the metal<br>
layer is often attributed to chemical oxidation, and particularly in<br><br>
the case of Cu, a reactant known as patina is an oxide. In this<br>
point, Ta and No have the effect on the deterioration of Cu.<br>
Concerning Mo, Zr, Cr, Ni, Ge and Au, when these metals<br>
are added, an alloy with Cu is precipitated on the film surface or a<br>
crystal grain boundary of Cu to inhibit diffusion of Cu in the grain<br>
boundary. Thus, the migration and the deterioration of Cu are<br>
inhibited.<br>
The thickness of the first reflection layer is preferably in<br>
the range of 6 nm to 12 nm.<br>
The second reflection layer need not be translucent as the<br>
first reflection layer, and is not particularly limited as long as it is<br>
the metallic material. Its thickness is preferably in the range of<br>
100 nm to 200 nm and more preferably 120 nm to 150 nm.<br>
The film forming methods of the reflection layer as the<br>
above include various vapor-phase growth methods, e.g., a vacuum<br>
vapor deposition method, a spattering method, a plasma CVD<br>
method, an optical CVD method, an ion plating method, and an<br>
electron beam vapor deposition method. Among them, the<br>
spattering method is excellent in mass productivity and film<br>
nature.<br>
It is required for the first substrate to sufficiently transmit<br>
the irradiated light for record and replay, and those conventionally<br>
known in the art are applied to the first substrate. As the<br><br>
material, typically glass, ceramics or resins are used, and the resin<br>
is suitable in terms of molding property and cost.<br>
The resins include, for example, polycarbonate resins, acryl<br>
resins, epoxy resins, polystyrene resins, acrylonitrile-styrene<br>
copolymer resins, polyethylene resins, polypropylene . resins,<br>
silicone-based resins, fluorine'based resins, ABS resins and<br>
urethane resins. Polycarbonate resins and acrylic resins such as<br>
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) which are excellent in terms of<br>
molding property, optical property and cost are preferable.<br>
On the surface of the first substrate on which the<br>
information layer is formed, a concavoconvex pattern which is a<br>
spiral shaped or concentric shaped groove for tracking the laser,<br>
light and is typically referred to as a groove portion or a land<br>
portion may be formed as needed. This is typically formed by an<br>
injection molding method or a photopolymer method. The<br>
thickness of the first substrate is preferably about 10 um to 600 um,<br>
and more preferably 550 um to 590 um.<br>
As the second substrate, the same material as in the first<br>
substrate may be used, but the material opaque for the record<br>
replay light may be used, and the second substrate may be<br>
different from the first substrate in material quality and groove<br>
shape.<br>
The thickness of the second substrate is not particularly<br><br>
limited, can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose,<br>
and it is preferable to select the thickness of the second substrate<br>
so that the total with the thickness of the first substrate is 1.2 mm.<br>
In the intermediate layer, it is preferable that the optical<br>
absorption at the wavelength of the light irradiated for the record<br>
and replay is small. Resins are preferable as the material in<br>
terras of molding property and cost, and ultraviolet ray curable<br>
resins, slow-acting resins and thermoplastic resins can be used.<br>
In the second substrate and the intermediate layer, the<br>
concavoconvex pattern such as groove and guide groove formed by<br>
the injection molding method or the photopolymer method may be<br>
formed in the same way as in the first substrate.<br>
The intermediate layer can optically' separate the first<br>
information layer and the second information layer by recognition<br>
of them by a pickup when recorded and replayed. Its thickness is<br>
preferably 10 \im to 70 urn and more preferably 30 \im to 60 \im.<br>
When the thickness is thinner than 10 jim, crosstalk between the<br>
information layers occurs sometimes. When it is thicker than 70<br>
urn, spherical aberration occurs when recorded and replayed in the<br>
second recording layer, and the record and replay tend to become<br>
difficult.<br>
(Optical recording method)<br>
When the recording is performed for the multilayer optical<br><br>
recording medium of the present invention, by employing the<br>
recording method of the present invention, it is possible to enhance<br>
the recording property of the recording layer other than the<br>
innermost one as seen from the side of light irradiation of the<br>
multilayer optical recording medium.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, in the conventional monolayer type<br>
rewritable optical recording medium such as DVD+RW, for example,<br>
when a IT cycle strategy (pulse trains of n-1 are used when marks<br>
of nT are recorded) is used, the recording is typically started from a<br>
time position which has delayed by IT for the data (see A in FIG.<br>
12). However, as the recording method for the recording layer<br>
other than the innermost one as seen from the side of light<br>
irradiation of the multilayer optical recording medium having two<br>
or more layers of the phase change recording layers, it is better to<br>
use the method in which a time width Tr which is the interval<br>
between the top pulse upstroke and the last pulse upstroke is<br>
widened as shown in B or C in FIG. 12 when the mark with a<br>
length nT is formed.<br>
Because, the film of the thick metal layer can not be formed<br>
because the high transmittance is necessary to be assured, and the<br>
heat release effect is compensated by the use of the transparent<br>
dielectric material in the information layers other than the<br>
innermost one as seen from the side of light irradiation of the<br><br>
multilayer optical recording medium. If the metal layer is<br>
thickened, the sufficient heat release effect is obtained and the<br>
recording mark is easily formed. However, when the transparent<br>
dielectric material is used, the sufficient heat release effect is not<br>
obtained because the thermal conductivity becomes lower than in<br>
the metal, and the amorphous mark is easily recrystallized. Thus,<br>
the mark with desired length is obtained by setting Tr widely.<br>
In this optical recording method, the top pulse may be<br>
upstroked early and the last pulse may be upstroked slowly as B in<br>
FIG. 12. Alternatively, only the top pulse may be upstroked early<br>
as C in FIG. 12.<br>
The range of Tr value may be (n-1.5)T 
For example, when 8T mark is recorded, Tr which satisfies 6.5T 
Tr 
Furthermore, in order to make the formation area of the<br>
amorphous mark large (thick) as possible, it is necessary to take a<br>
long cooling time after heating. Therefore, it is preferable that a<br>
recording pulse width (Tmp) is made small as possible. When a<br>
clock cycle is T, it is preferable to satisfy 0.12 
recording pulse) 
When (Tmp/cycle of recording pulse) is shorter than 0.12, a<br>
high recording power is required. In particular, when the<br>
recording speed is as fast as about 9.2 m/s and when recorded by IT<br><br>
cycle, because of the clock cycle T=15.9 nsec, Tmp=0.12T=1.9 nsec.<br>
Thus, in the recording apparatus, response time (upstroke and<br>
downstroke times) of laser emitted from LD (laser diode) is too late,<br>
and it becomes difficult to record with the desired recording power.<br>
When (Tmp/cycle of recording pulse) is longer than 0.3, because of<br>
short cooling time, recrystallization by remaining heat of the<br>
subsequent pulse occurs, and the desired modulation degree can<br>
not be assured.<br>
Generally it is preferable to use parameters of the recoding<br>
pulse strategy shown in FIG. 13 as the range of the above Tr is kept,<br>
but the recording strategy is not limited thereto. For example, in<br>
DVD, since 3T mark and 4T mark appear more frequently than<br>
other long marks, they affect the recording property (jitter) most<br>
frequently. Thus, limiting to the recording of the 3 mark and the<br>
4T mark, it is possible to set up the parameters individually, e.g.,<br>
(dTtop3), (dTtop4), (dTlp3), (dTlp4), (dTare3) and (dTera4).<br>
Furthermore, by the optical recording method of the present<br>
invention, it is possible to make the recording sensitivity better.<br>
In the second and outer layers on the multilayer optical<br>
recording medium, the recording power which is twice or more<br>
compared with the monolayer optical recording medium is required<br>
because the laser light must be transmitted through the first layer.<br>
Thus, it is favorable to lower the required recording power as<br><br>
possible. The cooling time can be made longer by not irradiating<br>
the pulse of the IT cycle as in FIG. 12 but reducing the number of<br>
the pulses. Thus, it is possible to reduce the recording power<br>
required for forming the amorphous mark by about 10% (see FIGs.<br>
14 and 15).<br>
FIGs. 14 and 15 are the data when recording repeatedly 10<br>
times (DOW 10) was performed at recording line speed of 9.2 m/s in<br>
the second recording layer of the dual layer optical recording<br>
medium made in Example 35. When recorded by the IT cycle<br>
strategy, the pulse width was 0.45T, and when recorded by the 2T<br>
cycle strategy, the pulse width was 0.8T. A specific example of the<br>
2T cycle strategy where when the amorphous mark with a length of<br>
nT was formed, if the number of the irradiated pulses was m (m is<br>
an integer of 1 or more), when n is an even number, the relation of<br>
n=2m is satisfied and when n is an odd number, the relation of<br>
n=2m+l is satisfied was shown in FIG. 16. In the figure, the<br>
number of the pulses is shown to be 5 in any of the cases of<br>
recording the mark with a length of 10T and recording the mark<br>
with a length of 11T. When the odd number mark such as 11T<br>
mark is recorded, a wave profile where the last pulse is shifted<br>
backward by about IT as shown in the figure could be used.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to provide<br>
the multilayer phase change optical recording medium where the<br><br>
recording performance has been enhanced as well as the recording<br>
sensitivity has been enhanced by obtaining the sufficient heat<br>
release effect even when the thickness of the reflection layer in<br>
each information layer other than the innermost one as seen from<br>
the side of the irradiation of laser light is ultrathin and increasing<br>
the modulation degree, the storage stability is excellent, and<br>
further the recording sensitivity in the innermost information<br>
layer as seen from the side of the irradiation of laser light has been<br>
enhanced by increasing the light transmittance of each information<br>
layer, and the optical recording method thereof.<br>
The present invention will be more specifically described<br>
below by. Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present. . ...<br>
invention is not limited thereto. The dual layer phase change<br>
optical recording media made in Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples have the constitution shown in FIG. 1 (but, having the •<br>
interface layer between the second reflection layer and the second<br>
upper protection layer).<br>
A DVD sprinter supplied from Unaxis as a spattering<br>
apparatus was used for film formation, and a DC and RF<br>
magnetron spattering method was employed.<br>
ODU-1000 supplied from PULSETEC was used for an<br>
evaluation apparatus, and the condition where a laser wavelength<br>
irradiated when recorded was 660 nm, a numerical aperture NA of<br><br>
objective lens = 0.65 and replay light power = 1.2 mW was<br>
employed. The recording strategy was the IT cycle strategy. The<br>
strategy used is as shown in Table 1 when represented by the<br>
parameters shown in FIG. 13. Numerical values in the table<br>
represent the time using [l/16]T as a unit. For example, "3"<br>
means [3/16]T. "-" before the numerical value means temporally<br>
delaying from the basic position.<br><br><br>
A recording line speed when recorded in the first recording<br>
layer was 9.2 m/s. Random recordings were performed repeatedly<br>
10 times (DOW 10) on three tracks, and the middle track among<br>
them was replayed. The random recording means that 10 type<br>
marks of 3T to 11T and 14T and space are irregularly recorded.<br>
In the evaluation criteria, the recording power where the<br>
light transmittance in the first information layer was 40% or more<br>
and the modulation degree was saturated was rendered the<br>

substrate side to the first information layer and the second<br>
information layer to perform the initialization. The initialization<br>
was performed by collecting the laser light emitted from the<br>
semiconductor laser (emission wavelength- 810 ±10 nm) by light<br>

For the above Examples 2, 3, 6 and 7 and Comparative<br>
Example 5, the modulation degree M (DOW 10) and "Itop x M (%)"<br>
after recording repeatedly 10 times (DOW 10) when the recording<br>
power (peak power Pp) was changed are shown in FIGs. 6 and 7.<br>
When ln203 (90 mol%)-ZnO (10 mol%) was used without<br>
using Sn oxide for the optical transmission layer in the first<br>
information layer as in Comparative Example 5, a low modulation<br><br>
degree curve was obtained as shown in FIG. 6 when recorded in the<br>
first information layer at a recording speed of 9.2 m/s. As the<br>
recording power was increased, the modulation degree was<br>
saturated at less than 0.6. As shown in FIG. 7, the recording<br>
performance "Itop x M" was increased to about 4%, but the<br>
transmittance became poor.<br>
On the contrary, as shown in Examples 2 and 3, when the Sn<br>
oxide was the major component in the first upper protection layer<br>
and the optical transmission layer, the modulation degree could be<br>
enhanced.<br>
Also as shown in Example 6, when the Sn oxide was the<br>
major component also in the first lower protection layer, the<br>
equivalent modulation degree could be assured at low power and<br>
the recording sensitivity was enhanced. Furthermore, as shown<br>
in Example 7, even when the first lower protection layer was the<br>
dual layer, the effects could be kept.<br>
As shown in Table 2, according to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to lower the optimal recording power Ppo [mW] in the first<br>
information layer and lower the recording power in the second<br>
information layer because the light transmittance could be<br>
enhanced. Thus, the consumption of electric power for laser<br>
output in the recording apparatus can be reduced.<br>
(Examples 22 to 35)<br><br>
For the dual layer phase change optical recording medium<br>
in Example 1, respective Examples, the storage property was<br>
evaluated.<br>
The recording line speed was 9.2 m/s when recorded in the<br>
first recording layer. The recording was evaluated by performing<br>
the random recording repeatedly 10 times (DOW 10). in three<br>
tracks and replaying the middle track among them. The IT cycle<br>
recording strategy was used for the recording method. The<br>
property was evaluated by jitters when the marks of 3T to 11T and<br>
14T and the space were randomly recorded. The jitter is one<br>
represented by standardizing a time lag between the border and<br>
the clock with a window width when the reflectance ratio levels of<br>
the mark and the space are binarized at slice level.<br>
For the determination criteria of the storage property, after<br>
stored under the environment of temperature at 80°C and 85% RH<br>
for 100 hours, when the change amount (increase amount) of DOW<br>
10 jitter was 1% or less, this case was determined as acceptance,<br>
and the case of exceeding 1% was determined as rejection. The<br>
evaluation results are collectively shown in Table 3.<br>

recording at about 10 m/s. This seems to be caused because the<br>
transfer line speed is delayed and it becomes difficult to completely<br>
delete the amorphous mark upon repeated recording (see FIG.8).<br><evaluation><br>
For Examples 36 to 43, the change amount of the DOW 10<br>
jitter when stored under the environment of the temperature at<br>
80°C and 85% RH for 100 hours was evaluated in the same way as<br>
in Example 22. The results are collectively shown in FIG. 11.<br><br>
For Examples 36, 41, 42 and 43, the results of measuring the<br>
transfer line speed and the DOW 10 jitter are collectively shown in<br>
FIG. 8.<br>
(Examples 44 to 46 and Comparative Examples 6 to 13)<br>
A dual layer phase change optical recording medium was<br>
made in the same way as in Example 2 except that the thickness of<br>
the first upper protection layer was changed to 0 nm (Comparative<br>
Examples 6), 2 nm (Example 44), 10 nm (Example 45), 15 nm<br>
(Example 46), 20 nm (Comparative Examples 7), 25 nm<br>
(Comparative Examples 8) or 30 nm (Comparative Examples 9). A<br>
dual layer phase change optical recording medium was also made<br>
in the same way as in Example 2 except that the material of the<br>
first upper protection layer was changed to ZnO (80 mol%)-SiO2 (20<br>
mol%) and its thickness was changed to 5 nm (Comparative<br>
Examples 10), 10 nm (Comparative Examples 11), 15 nm<br>
(Comparative Examples 12) and 20 nm (Comparative Examples<br>
13).<br>
For these optical recording medium, the change amount of<br>
the DOW 10 jitter was evaluated in the same way as in Example 22.<br>
The results are collectively shown together with Example 2<br>
(thickness 5 nm) in FIG. 10.<br>
As is shown in the figure, the medium in which the change<br>
amount of the DOW 10 jitter is very small is obtained when the Sn<br><br>
oxide is contained and the thickness is 15 nm or less whereas in<br>
Comparative Examples using ZnOSiO2, the change amount of the<br>
DOW 10 jitter is about 3% or more in any cases.<br>
Meanwhile, the results obtained by measuring the<br>
modulation degree M (DOW 10) for the optical recording medium<br>
using Sn02 and the optical recording medium in Comparative<br>
Example 6 are shown in FIG. 17. As is shown in the figure, the<br>
modulation degree M of 60% or more can not be assured in<br>
Comparative Example 6.<br>
Therefore, combining the results in FIGs. 10 and 17, it is<br>
found that it is necessary that the thickness of the first upper<br>
protection layer is in the range of 2 nm to 15 nm.<br>
(Examples 47 to 51 and Comparative Examples 14 to 15)<br>
The evaluation was performed using the dual layer optical<br>
recording medium made in Example 36. The jitters after<br>
recording repeatedly 10 times (DOW 10), after recording<br>
repeatedly 100 times (DOW 100), and after recording repeatedly<br>
500 times (DOW 500) at a recording line speed of 9.2 m/s were<br>
measured with changing Tr value. In the evaluation criterion, the<br>
case of showing the jitter of 11% or less was determined as<br>
acceptance.<br>
The results are shown in Table 4. When Tr is set up to be<br>
shorter than (n-1.5)T, the jitter worsens because the shorter mark<br><br>
tB.au the desired amorphous mark length, is formed. When Tr is<br>
set up to be longer than (n-0.5)T; the longer mark than the desired<br>
amorphous mark length is formed, and deletion power is set up to<br>
he high to adjust it. The recording property in recording<br>
repeatedly 500 times worsens due to contribution of heat effect.<br><br><br><br>
