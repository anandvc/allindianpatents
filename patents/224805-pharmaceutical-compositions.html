The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on beta2 agonists with a long-lasting effect and salts of a new anticholinergic, processes for preparing them and their use in the treatment of respiratory complaints.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on beta2 agonists with a long-lasting effect and salts of a new anticholinergic 1, processes for preparing them and their use in the treatment of respiratory complaints.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention the anticholinergic agents used are the salts of formula 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein<br><br>
denotes an anion with a single negative charge, preferably an anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, sulphate, phosphate, methanesutphonate, nitrate, maleate, acetate, citrate, fumarate, tartrate, oxatate, succinate, benzoate and p-toluenesulphonate.<br><br>
Preferably, the salts of formula 1 are used wherein<br>
X '	denotes an anion with a single negative charge selected from among<br>
the chloride, bromide, 4-toluenesulphonate and methanesulphonate,<br>
preferably bromide.<br>
Most preferably, the salts of formula 1 are used wherein<br>
X ~	denotes an anion with a single negative charge selected from among<br>
the chloride, bromide and methanesulphonate, preferably bromide.<br>
Particularly preferred according to the invention is the salt of formula 1 wherein X " denotes bromide.<br>
Anticholinergics may appropriately be used to treat a number of diseases. Particular mention should be made, for example, of the treatment of asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). For treating these diseases WO 92/16528 proposes, for example, anticholinergics which have a scopine, tropenol or tropine basic structure.<br>
The problem on which WO 92/16528 is based is the preparation of anticholinergically active compounds which are characterised by their long-lasting activity. To solve this problem WO 92/16528 discloses inter alia benzilic acid esters of scopine, tropenol or tropine.<br>
For treating chronic diseases it is often desirable to prepare pharmaceutical compositions with a longer-lasting effect. This will generally ensure that the concentration of the active substance needed to achieve the therapeutic effect is present in the body for a longer period of time without the need for the pharmaceutical composition to be administered repeatedly and all too frequently. Moreover, if an active substance is administered at longer intervals of time, this contributes to the feeling of well-being of the patient to a considerable degree. It is particularly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition which can be used to therapeutically good effect by administering it once a day (single dose). A single application per day has the advantage that the patient can become accustomed relatively quickly to the regular taking of the medicament at a particular time of the day.<br><br>
If it is to be used as a medicament for administration once a day, the active substance which is to be given must meet particular requirements. First of all, the desired onset of the activity after the administration of the pharmaceutical composition should occur relatively quickly and ideally the activity should remain as constant as possible over a fairly lengthy ensuing period. On the other hand the duration of activity of the pharmaceutical composition should not greatly exceed a period of about one day. Ideally, an active substance should have an activity profile such that the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition which is intended to be administered once a day and contains the active substance in therapeutically appropriate doses can be properly controlled.<br>
It has been found that the esters of scopine, tropenol or tropine disclosed in WO 92/16528 do not meet these more stringent requirements. Because of their extremely long duration of activity, significantly exceeding the period of about one day specified above, they cannot be used therapeutically in a single once-a-day dose. The salts of formula 1_however meet this requirement.<br>
Surprisingly, an unexpectedly beneficial therapeutic effect, particularly a synergistic effect can be observed in the treatment of inflammatory and/or obstructive diseases of the respiratory tract if the anticholinergic of formula 1 is used with one or more betamimetics 2.  In view of this synergistic effect the pharmaceutical combinations according to the invention can be used in smaller doses than would be the case with the individual compounds used in monotherapy in the usual way. As a further positive aspect of the present invention, unwanted side effects such as may occur when beta2 agonists are administered, for example, are thus reduced. Undesirable side effects in this context are, in particular, the stimulant effects on the heart which are sometimes caused by betamimetics, especially tachycardia, palpitations, angina-pectoris-like pain and arryhthmia.<br>
The effects mentioned above may be observed both when the two active substances are administered simultaneously in a single active substance formulation and when they are administered successively in separate formulations. According to the invention, it is preferable to administer the two active substance ingredients simultaneously in a single formulation.<br><br>
Within the scope of the present invention, any reference to the compound V_ is to be regarded as a reference to the pharmacologically active cation of the following formula contained in the salts 1 :<br>

Examples of particularly suitable organic acids include ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids.  It is also possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid are preferred.  If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH.<br>
According to the invention, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium editate, as stabiliser or complexing agent is unnecessary in the present formulation. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these compounds.  In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium editate is less than 100mg/100ml, preferably less than 50mg/100 ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100 ml. Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium editate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are preferred.<br>
Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention. Preferred co-solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols - particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the pharmacologically suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active substance formulation. Preferably, these substances have<br><br>
no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents.<br>
The preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body.<br>
Preservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly cetyl pyridiniurn chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50mg/100ml, more preferably between 5 and 20mg/100ml.<br>

The propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention are administered in particular using inhalers of the kind which are capable of nebulising a small amount of a liquid formulation in the therapeutic dose within a few seconds to produce an aerosol suitable for therapeutic inhalation. Within the scope of the present invention, preferred inhalers are those in which a quantity of less than 100|.iL, preferably less than 50|al_, more preferably between 20 and 30^1 of active substance solution can be nebulised in preferably one spray action to form an aerosol with an average particle size of less than 20(im, preferably less than 1Q+im, in such a way that the inhalable part of the aerosol corresponds to the therapeutically effective quantity.<br><br>
An apparatus of this kind for propellant-free delivery of a metered quantity of a liquid pharmaceutical composition for inhalation is described for example in International Patent Application WO 91/14468 and also in WO 97/12687 (cf. in particular Figures 6a and 6b). The nebulisers (devices) described therein are known by the name Respimat®.<br>
This nebuliser (Respimat®) can advantageously be used to produce the inhalable aerosols according to the invention containing the combination of active substances 1 and 2   Because of its cylindrical shape and handy size of less than 9 to 15 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, this device can be carried at all times by the patient. The nebuliser sprays a defined volume of pharmaceutical formulation using high pressures through small nozzles so as to produce inhalable aerosols.<br>
The preferred atomiser essentially consists of an upper housing part, a pump housing, a nozzle, a locking mechanism, a spring housing, a spring and a storage container, characterised by<br>
a pump housing which is secured in the upper housing part and which<br>
comprises at one end a nozzle body with the nozzle or nozzle arrangement,<br>
a hollow plunger with valve body,<br>
a power takeoff flange in which the hollow plunger is secured and which is<br>
located in the upper housing part,<br>
-	a locking mechanism situated in the upper housing part,<br>
-	a spring housing with the spring contained therein, which is rotatably<br>
mounted on the upper housing part by means of a rotary bearing,<br>
-	a lower housing part which is fitted onto the spring housing in the axial<br>
direction<br>
The hollow plunger with valve body corresponds to a device disclosed in WO 97/12687.  It projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing and is axially movable within the cylinder. Reference is made in particular to Figures 1 to 4, especially Figure 3, and the relevant parts of the description. The hollow plunger with valve body exerts a pressure of 5 to 60 Mpa (about 50 to 600 bar), preferably 10 to 60 Mpa (about 100 to 600 bar) on the fluid, the measured amount of active substance solution, at its high pressure end at the moment when the spring is actuated. Volumes of 10 to 50 microlitres are preferred, while volumes of<br><br>
10 to 20 microlitres are particularly preferred and a volume of 15 microlitres per spray is most particularly preferred.<br>
The valve body is preferably mounted at the end of the hollow plunger facing the valve body.<br>
The nozzle in the nozzle body is preferably microstructured, i.e. produced by microtechnology. Microstructured nozzle bodies are disclosed for example in WO-94/07607; reference is hereby made to the contents of this specificat'fon, particularly Figure 1 therein and the associated description. The nozzle body consists for example of two sheets of glass and/or silicon firmly joined together, at least one of which has one or more microstructured channels which connect the nozzle inlet end to the nozzle outlet end. At the nozzle outlet end there is at least one round or non-round opening 2 to 10 microns deep and 5 to 15 microns wide, the depth preferably being 4.5 to 6.5 microns while the length is preferably 7 to 9 microns<br>
In the case of a plurality of nozzle openings, preferably two, the directions of spraying of the nozzles in the nozzle body may extend parallel to one another or may be inclined relative to one another in the direction of the nozzle opening. In a nozzle body with at least two nozzle openings at the outlet end the directions of spraying may be at an angle of 20 to 160° to one another, preferably 60 to 150°, most preferably 80 to 100°   The nozzle openings are preferably arranged at a spacing of 10 to 200 microns, more preferably at a spacing of 10 to 100 microns, most preferably 30 to 70 microns. Spacings of 50 microns are most preferred. The directions of spraying will therefore meet in the vicinity of the nozzle openings.<br>
The liquid pharmaceutical preparation strikes the nozzle body with an entry pressure of up to 600 bar, preferably 200 to 300 bar, and is atomised into an inhalable aerosol through the nozzle openings. The preferred particle or droplet sizes of the aerosol are up to 20 microns, preferably 3 to 10 microns.<br>
The locking mechanism contains a spring, preferably a cylindrical helical compression spring, as a store for the mechanical energy. The spring acts on the power takeoff flange as an actuating member the movement of which is<br><br>
determined by the position of a locking member. The travel of the power takeoff flange is precisely limited by an upper and lower stop. The spring is preferably biased, via a power step-up gear, e.g. a helical thrust gear, by an external torque which is produced when the upper housing part is rotated counter to the spring housing in the lower housing part. In this case, the upper housing part and the power takeoff flange have a single or multiple V-shaped gear.<br>
The locking member with engaging locking surfaces is arranged in a ring around the power takeoff flange. It consists, for example, of a ring of plastic or metal which is inherently radially elastically deformable. The ring is arranged in a plane at right angles to the atomiser axis. After the biasing of the spring, the locking surfaces of the locking member move into the path of the power takeoff flange and prevent the spring from relaxing. The locking member is actuated by means of a button. The actuating button is connected or coupled to the locking member. In order to actuate the locking mechanism, the actuating button is moved parallel to the annular plane, preferably into the atomiser; this causes the deformable ring to deform in the annular plane. Details of the construction of the locking mechanism are given in WO 97/20590.<br>
The lower housing part is pushed axially over the spring housing and covers the mounting, the drive of the spindle and the storage container for the fluid.<br>
When the atomiser is actuated the upper housing part is rotated relative to the lower housing part, the lower housing part taking the spring housing with it. The spring is thereby compressed and biased by means of the helical thrust gear and the locking mechanism engages automatically. The angle of rotation is preferably a whole-number fraction of 360 degrees, e.g. 180 degrees. At the same time as the spring is biased, the power takeoff part in the upper housing part is moved along by a given distance, the hollow plunger is withdrawn inside the cylinder in the pump housing, as a result of which some of the fluid is sucked out of the storage container and into the high pressure chamber in front of the nozzle.<br>
If desired, a number of exchangeable storage containers which contain the fluid to be atomised may be pushed into the atomiser one after another and used in<br><br>
succession. The storage container contains the aqueous aerosol preparation according to the invention.<br>
The atomising process is initiated by pressing gently on the actuating button. As a result, the locking mechanism opens up the path for the power takeoff member. The biased spring pushes the plunger into the cylinder of the pump housing. The fluid leaves the nozzle of the atomiser in atomised form.<br>
Further details of construction are disclosed in PCT Applications WO 97/12683 and WO 97/20590, to which reference is hereby made.<br>
The components of the atomiser (nebuliser) are made of a material which is suitable for its purpose. The housing of the atomiser and, if its operation permits, other parts as well, are preferably made of plastics, e.g. by injection moulding. For medicinal purposes, physiologically safe materials are used.<br>
Figures 2a/b attached to this patent application, which are identical to Figures 6a/b of WO 97/12687, show the nebuliser (Respimat®) which can advantageously be used for inhaling the aqueous aerosol preparations according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2a shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring biased while Figure 2b shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring relaxed.<br>
The upper housing part (51) contains the pump housing (52) on the end of which is mounted the holder (53) for the atomiser nozzle.  In the holder is the nozzle body (54) and a filter (55). The hollow plunger (57) fixed in the power takeoff flange (56) of the locking mechanism projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing. At its end the hollow plunger carries the valve body (58). The hollow plunger is sealed off by means of the seal (59). Inside the upper housing part is the stop (60) on which the power takeoff flange abuts when the spring is relaxed. On the power takeoff flange is the stop (61) on which the power takeoff flange abuts when the spring is biased. After the biasing of the spring the locking member (62) moves between the stop (61) and a support (63) in the upper housing part. The actuating button (64) is connected to the locking member. The<br><br>
upper housing part ends in the mouthpiece (65) and is sealed off by means of the protective cover (66) which can be placed thereon.<br>
The spring housing (67) with compression spring (68) is rotatably mounted on the upper housing part by means of the snap-in lugs (69) and rotary bearing. The lower housing part (70) is pushed over the spring housing. Inside the spring housing is the exchangeable storage container (71) for the fluid (72) which is to be atomised. The storage container is sealed off by the stopper (73) through which the hollow plunger projects into the storage container and is immersed at its end in the fluid (supply of active substance solution).<br>
The spindle (74) for the mechanical counter is mounted in the covering of the spring housing. At the end of the spindle facing the upper housing part is the drive pinion (75). The slider (76) sits on the spindle.<br>
The nebuliser described above is suitable for nebulising the aerosol preparations according to the invention to produce an aerosol suitable for inhalation.<br>
If the formulation according to the invention is nebulised using the method described above (Respimat®) the quantity delivered should correspond to a defined quantity with a tolerance of not more than 25%, preferably 20% of this amount in at least 97%, preferably at least 98% of all operations of the inhaler (spray actuations). Preferably, between 5 and 30 mg of formulation, most preferably between 5 and 20 mg of formulation are delivered as a defined mass on each actuation.<br>
However, the formulation according to the invention may also be nebulised by means of inhalers other than those described above, e.g. jet stream inhalers or other stationary nebulisers.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions as described above combined with a device suitable for administering these formulations, preferably in conjunction with the Respimat®. Preferably, the invention relates to propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions<br><br>

The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 20°C and 0.5 h at 50°C. The solvent is distilled off and the residue remaining is used in the next step without any further purification.<br>
1.P.: scopine 2,2-diphenylpropionate:<br>
The residue obtained from step 1.a. is dissolved in 100 ml of dichloromethane and<br>
at 40°C a solution of 51.45 g (0.33 mol) of scopine in 200 ml of dichloromethane is<br>
added dropwise thereto. The resulting suspension is stirred for 24 h at 40°C, then<br>
the precipitate formed is suction filtered and the filtrate is extracted first with water,<br>
then with aqueous hydrochloric acid. The combined aqueous phases are made<br>
alkaline with aqueous sodium carbonate solution, extracted with dichloromethane,<br>
the organic phase is dried over Na2S04, evaporated to dryness and the<br>
hydrochloride is precipitated from the residue. The product is purified by<br>
recrystallisation from acetonitrile.<br>
