Process for preparing acvlphosphanes and derivatives thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a new, selective process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphanes, mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides starting from elemental phosphorous [P]*, or phosphorous reagents with a formal oxidation state of phosphorous &gt; -3, such as for example phosphorous trihalogenide P(Hal)3 or, phosphorous oxides without isolation of the intermediates.<br>
As the technology of the mono- and bisacylphosphine oxides is becoming increasingly important owing to the excellent photoinitiator properties of these compounds there is also a need for highly practicable processes involving as little elaboration for the preparation of the required intermediates, especially of the corresponding mono- and bisacylphosphanes, but also of the oxide and sulfide end products. There still remains a need for a process which allows a high variability and flexibility for the introduction of all three substituents at the phosphorous atom of mono- and bisacylphosphane structures.<br>
The European Patent Publication EP1 135 399 B1 describes a process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphanes, of mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides and of mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides, which process comprises first reacting organic P-monohalogeno-phosphanes (R2-PCI) or P,P-dihalogenophosphanes (R-PCI2) or mixtures thereof, with an alkali metal or magnesium in combination with lithium, where appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, and then carrying out the reaction with acid halides and, in the case of the process for the preparation of oxides, carrying out an oxidation step and, in the case of the preparation of sulfides, reacting the phosphanes so obtained with sulfur. The reaction is usefully carried out in a solvent. The solvent used may be, in particular, ethers which are liquid at normal pressure and room temperature. Examples thereof are dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methylpropyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether, dioxane or tetrahydro-furan. Tetrahydrofuran is preferably used.<br>
The International Application PCT/EP 04/51427 describes a process to prepare mono- and bisacylphosphanes, which process comprises first reacting organic P-monohalogeno-phosphanes (R2-PCI) or P,P-dihalogenophosphanes (R-PCI2), or phosphorous halide oxide or phosphorous halide sulfide with an alkali metal (metallation) in a solvent in the presence of a proton source (reduction), and where appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, and then carrying out the reaction with acid halides.<br><br>
Brandsma and coworkers describe the preparation of dihydrogen metal phosphides, represented by the formula MePH2, by the reaction of Me3P with a proton source (tert-butanol) in an organic solvent, preferably THF or DME (M.C.J.M. van Hoijdonk, G. Gerritsen, L. Brandsma, Phosphorous, Sulfur, Silicon 2000, 162, 39-49). Addition of an alkyl halide RHal leads to the formation of a monoalkyl phosphine RPH2. It is known that monoalkyl phosphines can be further reacted with an acid halide, as described in the International Application PCT/EP 04/51427, filed July 9, 2004.<br>
A. Steinicke and coworkers describe the reduction of red phosphorous with strongly reducing metals, giving metal phosphides MenPm. Addition of an alkyl halide leads to the formation of alkylcyclophosphanes cyclo-(RP)n (A. Steinicke, K.-H. Thiele, A. Haaland, V.I. Sokolov, H.V. Volden, Z. anorg. allg. Chem. 1997, 623, 1925-1930). Reductive cleavage of alkylcyclophosphanes with a metal in the presence of a proton source (e.g. tert-butanol) gives a monoalkyl phosphine RPH2, which can be further reacted with an acid halide, as described in the International Application PCT/EP 04/51427.<br>
The above referenced patent publications describe a process wherein the alkyl or aryl substituent at the phosphorous atom of the mono- or bisacylphosphane was part of the starting material R2-PCI or R-PCI2. As only a limited number of P-monohalogenophosphanes (R2-PCI) or P,P-dihalogenophosphanes (R-PCI2) are readily available, accessible, or processible, there is a need to develop a process enabling the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphanes which process provides a higher variance for the substituents at the phosphorous atom. Furthermore, it should be avoided to use toxic, pyrophoric and difficult to handle phosphorous starting materials, like phosphine gas (PH3), or primary and secondary alkyl and aryl phosphines R-PH2. R2-PH, respectively.<br>
Photoinitiators bearing suitable functional groups that allow a chemical reaction with suitable functional groups on low molecular, oligomeric or polymeric compounds are highly demanded for the development of compositions containing low volatile and non-migrating photoinitiators, as they are for examples required for printing inks used in direct food contact applications. Furthermore, photoinitiators bearing suitable functional groups can be linked to other additives, such as sensitizers, stabilizers, surface active agents and so on, in order to provide an additional functionality to the photoinitiator. Hence an easy access to such<br><br>
functionalized photoinitiators, especially mono- or bisacylphosphine oxides, is highly desirable<br>
In the above mentioned patent publications, the acylation of the intermediate primary or secondary alkyl and aryl phosphines R-PH2 and R2-PH, respectively, is performed in the presence of strong bases, such as butyl lithium, or alkali metals such as lithium or sodium. Many functional groups do not tolerate such reaction conditions. Hence the type of functional groups that can be introduced on the residue R by the processes claimed in the afore mentioned patents is limited to those that tolerate these harsh reaction conditions. Therefore, there is a need for a synthetic access that allows the easy introduction of a broader variety of functional groups on the substituents on the phosphorous atom.<br>
It has now been found that in the process according to the invention a reactive intermediate is generated, which can selectively be alkylated/arylated using any alkylating/arylating agent (e.g. RHal), or reacted with typical electrophiles. The substituent R at the phosphorous atom is thus introduced via a reaction with an electrophile within the said process. The possibility of using any electrophile provides a higher variance for the substituents at the phosphorous atom.<br>
Furthermore, said substituent R is introduced after the acylation step that requires the use of strong bases, such as butyl lithium, or of alkali metals, such as lithium or sodium. Thus even substituents bearing functional groups that would not tolerate such conditions can be introduced, thereby considerably enlarging the variance of functional groups.<br>
Starting with the reduction of elemental phosphorous [P]*,, phosphorous trihalogenide P(Hal)3, or other phosphorous compounds possessing a phosphorous atom with a formal oxidation state &gt; -3, followed by the acylation of the obtained metal phosphides MenPm [e.g-trialkali metal phosphide (Me3P)], or the acylation of dihydrogen metal phosphide (MePH2), it is possible to avoid the use, the isolation, the generation, or the handling of a toxic gas like PH3, or alkyl and aryl phosphines. The whole process may optionally be performed in the same reactor ("one-pot" reaction).<br>

Process parameters Step a)<br>
The elemental phosphorous may be employed as a finely divided solid or as a melt, or it may<br>
be dissolved or dispersed in an  inert organic solvent. As elemental phosphorous is<br>
spontaneously flammable in moist air, it is preferred that the reaction be carried out in an<br>
inert gas atmosphere.<br>
PCI3 is preferentially dissolved in an inert organic solvent; Other suitable phosphorous<br>
compounds with a formal oxidation state of the phosphorous atom higher than -3 are<br>
employed as solids, in suspension or dissolved in an inert organic solvent.<br>
As solvents, ethers such as dimethoxyethane, liquid ammonia or a mixture of liquid ammonia<br>
and tetrahydrofuran are preferred.<br>
Step a) is preferably carried out in the presence of a hydrocarbon catalyst.<br>
Advantageously, the reaction of the reducing metal, dispersed in a solvent, and phosphorous may be effected at temperatures ranging from -70°C to +160°C, e.g. from room temperature to 80°C.<br>
Step b)<br>
In the inventive process step b) is optionally. Thus, metal phosphides MenPm [e.g. trialkali metal phosphide (Me3P)] may react directly with the acylating agent. However, because of an improved yield, step b) is preferably carried out. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range from -20°C to +160°C, e.g. from room temperature to 80°C.<br>
Catalysts and activators in step a) and b) are used in a molar ratio of catalyst to the reducing metal of for example 1:2 to 1:1000.<br>
Catalysts and activators in step a) and b) may be added prior or during the reduction of elemental phosphorous.<br>
It is possible to optionally isolate the product of step b) as an alcoholate cluster of the phosphide before using it in step c).<br>
It is possible to add polar or dipolar co-solvents to the reaction mixture during or after step a) and b). Such solvents may be linear or cyclic amides like dimethylacetamide (DMA), n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), cyclic ureas like 1,3-dimethypropylene urea (DMPU), linear and cyclic glycols like diglyme and dimethoxyethane (DME).<br><br>
Step c)<br>
The reaction temperature for the reaction with the acid halide is usefully in the range from -20° to +80°C. A bisacylphosphide intermediate is formed which may form an O-coordinated bisacylphosphaenolate chelate complex of the formula (V) or (Va')<br><br>
The bisacylphosphide intermediate is stabilized due to the formation of an O-coordinated bisacylphosphaenolate chelate complex in the case of alkali metals. The complex might be further stabilized by metal-metal exchange. Suitable exchange metals are: boron, aluminium, chromium, nickel.<br>
Step d)<br>
The enolate may be isolated or may easily be further reacted with an electrophilic agent. The choice of the electrophilic agent is not limited. Non limiting examples are: straight-chain or branched d-CisalkyI halides, C2-C8alkenyl halides, substituted alkylhalides such as fluoro, or hydroxy, or carbonyl, or sulfonyl, or vinyl, or siloxanyl, or alkoxycarbonyl, or acyloxy or by heterocyclic groups substituted alkylhalides, C5-C12cycloalkyl halides, benzyl halides and aryl halides such as phenyl halide, naphthyl halide or biphenyl halide. Other electophilic agents are alkyl sulfates, alkyltosylates, alkylmethylsulfonates, epoxides, episulfide or acrylate or methacrylate esters.. It is likewise possible to use alkylating reagents giving ionic functions, e.g., monobromoacetic acid, monobromopropionic acid, sodium 3-bromopropanesulfonate and N-(2-bromoethyl)diethylamine. Silyl or siloxanyl groups may be implemented via chlorosilane or chlorosiloxane, or by the use of a-halo-co-silanyl or siloxanylalkanes.<br>
The reaction temperature in step d) is usefully in the range from room temperature to 100°.<br>
The bisacylphosphane of formula I can be isolated by the customary technological methods which are known to the skilled person, for example by filtration, evaporation or distillation. Likewise, the customary methods of purification may be used, for example crystallisation, distillation or chromatography.<br><br>
However, the phosphanes can also be reacted without isolation to the corresponding mono-or bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfides.<br>
Using the process of this invention it is also possible to prepare mono- and bisacyl-phosphanes together in one reaction step.<br>
Depending on the substituents used, unsymmetric compounds may be formed by the novel process.<br>
Monoacylphosphane oxides are compounds of the formula I' corresponding to compounds of the formula I wherein n=1 and m=1.<br><br>
The residues RT and R3 may be the same or may be different.<br>
Bisacylphosphane oxides are compounds of the formula H corresponding to compounds of the formula I wherein n=1 and m=2.<br><br>
The residues R2 and R2* may be the same or may be different.<br>
By means of the novel process it is furthermore also possible to prepare mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic monoacylphosphanes or mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic bisacylphosphanes.<br>
If required, all of the mixtures may be separated by the processes customarily used in the technology or they may be further used as they are.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphane sulfides. This process is first carried out as described above and a mono- or bisacylphosphane (I) is prepared. The crude reaction product (I) can then be further processed without purification and an additional reaction step may be carried out without isolation of the phosphane (I) using the solution of the crude product. If required,<br><br>
the solvent may be changed, for example, by concentrating the solution containing the mono-or bisacylphosphane and taking up the residue in a new solvent. Of course it is also possible to further react above-described unseparated mixtures of compounds of formula (I) to the corresponding oxide or sulfide.<br>
It is recommended to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture prior to the oxidation step to a pH of 2-8, preferably to a pH of 3-6 by addition of typical inorganic and/or organic acids or buffer systems.<br>
When preparing the respective oxide (Via), the oxidation of the phosphane (I) is carried out using the oxidant conventionally used in the technology<br><br>
Suitable oxidants are in particular hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxy compounds, for example peracetic acid or t-butylhydroperoxide, air or pure oxygen.<br>
The oxidation is usefully carried out in solution. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene or mesitylene, or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkane mixtures, e.g. petroleum ether, hexane or cyclo-hexane.During oxidation, the reaction temperature is preferably kept in the range from 0° to 120°C, preferably from 20° and 80°C.<br>
The reaction products (Via) can be isolated and purified by conventional processing methods known to the skilled person.<br><br><br>
The mono- or bisacylphosphanes (I) are in this case reacted in substance or, where appropriate, in a suitable inert organic solvent with an equimolar to 2-fold molar amount of elementary sulfur. Suitable solvents are for example those described for the oxidation reaction. However, it is also possible to use e.g. aliphatic or aromatic ethers, such as dibutyl ether, dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diphenyl ether, in the temperature range from 20° to 250°C, preferably from 60° to 120°C. The resulting mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfide, or its solution, is usefully freed from any remaining elementary sulfur by filtration. After the solvent is removed, the mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfide can be isolated by distillation, chromatography or recrystallisation in pure form.<br>
As mentioned above, it is also possible to use mixtures of compounds of formula I for the oxidation or reaction to the sulfide. The correspondingly obtained oxide or sulfide mixtures can either be separated by processes customarily used in the technology or may be used as mixtures.<br>
All of the above reactions are usefully carried out with exclusion of air in an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. under nitrogen or argon gas. The respective reaction mixture is usefully also stirred.<br>
The acid halides (III, III'), the carboxylic acid esters (IV, IV) or the electrophilic compounds RT-Hal or R3-Hal used as starting materials are known substances, some of which are commercially available, or may be prepared in analogy to known compounds.<br>
It is characteristic of the novel process that the individual processing steps can be carried out directly one after the other without the need for isolating and purifying the respective intermediates.<br>
Mixtures such as those described in the process for the preparation of the corresponding phosphanes may also be formed, or may also be specifically produced, in the above-described process for the preparation of mono- or bisacylphosphane oxides or mono- or bisacylphosphane sulfides. Such mixtures can be separated by methods known in the technology or may be further used in the form of mixtures.<br>
The phosphanes which are accessible by the novel process are important educts for the preparation of the corresponding phosphane oxides and phosphane sulfides. The phosphane<br><br>
oxides and phosphane sulfides are used in the art as initiators in photopolymerisation reactions.<br>
The oxidation is usefully carried out in solution. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene or mesitylene, or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkane mixtures, e.g. petroleum ether, hexane or cyclo-hexane. During oxidation, the reaction temperature is preferably kept in the range from 0° to 120°C, preferably from 20° and 80°C. The reaction products can be isolated and purified by conventional processing methods known to the skilled person.<br>
Using the process of this invention it is possible to prepare bisacylphosphanes or bisacyl-phospane oxides or sulfides without isolating any intermediate ("one-pot" reaction).<br>
If two different acid halides or two different carboxylic acid esters are used, unsymmetric compounds may be formed by the novel process. Preferred is a process wherein a carboxylic acid ester followed by an acid chloride of a different acid may be used for the synthesis of unsymmetric compounds.<br>
The phosphanes which are accessible by the novel process are important educts for the preparation of the corresponding phosphane oxides and phosphane sulfides. The phosphane oxides and phosphane sulfides are used in the art as initiators in photopolymerisation reactions.<br>

c-1) Isolation of {Na[P(COMes)2]*DME}<br>
The reaction mixture of step c) is concentrated under high vacuum. The resulting orange-yellow foam is taken up in 100 ml of toluene and then filtered through G4/Celite. The filter cake is twice washed with toluene providing a clear orange-yellow filtrate solution. The filtrate solution is concentrated under vacuum to a volume of about 70 ml, and then carefully overlayed with hexane (30 ml). Yellow cubic crystals separate from the solution and are identified as sodium bis(mesitoyI)phosphidexDME {Na[P(COMes)2]xDME} (C24H32Na04P, M = 438.47 g/mol) by 31P-, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, single-crystal X-ray structural analysis shows that the crystals are composed of an ion pair complex of the formula [Na3[P(COMes)2]4] [Na(DME)3]. The yellow crystals are soluble in toluene, THF and DME, however little soluble in hexane.<br><br>

Curing is carried out by conveying the sample twice, on a conveyor belt which is moving at a speed of 10 m/min, beneath an 80 W/cm medium-pressure mercury lamp (Hanovia, USA). The pendulum hardness is then determined in accordance with Konig (DIN53157) in [s]. The pendulum hardness is a measure of the through-curing of the composition. The higher the values, the more effective the curing which has been carried out.
