Complete Specification<br>
A NOVEL BENZIMIDIAZOLE FORMULATION<br>
CADILA HEALTH CARE LTD, Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad-380015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an oral pharmaceutical formulation containing a benzimidiazole compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to an oral pharmaceutical formulation containing a benzimidiazole compound in the form of a capsule, tablet or pellets. <br>
Background of Invention &amp; Prior Art:<br>
Omeprazole and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is known to be useful for inhibiting gastric acid secretion by controlling gastric acid secretion at the final step of the acid secretary pathway. Omeprazole shows a powerful inhibitory action against secretion of gastric juice (Lancet, Nov. 27, 1982, p. 1223-1224).<br>
Omeprazole is however susceptible to degradation and transformation in acidic and neutral media. The half-life of omeprazole in water solutions at pH-values less than four is shorter than ten minutes. At pH 7, the degradation reaction proceeds rapidly and the half-life of omeprazole is about 14 hours, while at higher pH-values the stability in solution is much better (Pilbrant and Cederberg, Scand. J. Gastroenterology 1985; 20 (supp. 108) p. 113-120). The stability profile is similar in solid phase. The degradation of omeprazole is catalyzed by acidic reacting compounds and is stabilized in mixtures with alkaline reacting compounds. The stability of omeprazole is also further affected by moisture, heat, organic solvents and to some degree by light.<br>
The current practice known in the Art is to put a separating / barrier layer in between the drug core and the enteric coat as to prevent the interaction among the acidic polymer and the drug. Ordinary enteric coatings, however, are made of acidic compounds. If covered with such a conventional enteric coating, omeprazole rapidly decomposes by direct or indirect contact with it, with the result that the preparations become badly discolored and loss in omeprazole content decreased with the passage of time.<br>
A fully bioavailable dosage form of omeprazole must release the active drug rapidly in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal canal. An oral dosage form of omeprazole must be protected from contact with the acidic gastric juice in order to reach the small intestine without degradation where pH is near 6.8 and where rapid absorption can occur.<br>
2<br><br>
Thus, there has been a need to develop an enteric coating layered multiple unit preparations such as divisible and/or dispersible tablets of omeprazole with good chemical stability as well as improved mechanical stability making it possible to produce well functioning and patient-friendly packages that will result in improved patient acceptance.<br>
In the present invention, the separating layer is avoided and the cores of the drug are provided with a direct enteric coat without resort to the separating layer. The formulation obtained as per the present invention is easier to package and the delivery of the formulation to the patient will be intact at the time of opening the package. According to the present invention only an enteric coating layered multiple units tablet can be made divisible and dispersible. A further advantage of a multiple unit dosage form is that it disperses into a multitude of small units in the stomach upon administration.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a multiple unit tablet dosage form, which are divisible and easy to handle. Such a multiple unit tablet dosage form may be dispersed in an aqueous liquid and can be given to patients with swallowing disorders and in pediatrics. Such a suspension of dispersed units or pellets of appropriate size can be used for oral administration.<br>
US Patent 4853230 describes an enteric coated pellet comprising of Omeprazole with alkaline compound as a core material having sub coat consisting of one or more of magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide or their composite and HPMC, HPC or PVP as a polymer.<br>
US Patent 5690960 states that magnesium salt of Omeprazole may be formulated as an enteric-coated tablet after compressing the granules. The enteric coated pellets of S- Omeprazole of disclosed patent may be filled in HGC. In both the cases, before applying the enteric coating to core material, it is required to sub coat the core material.<br>
US Patent 3132771 discloses a formulation of S- omeprazole magnesium in a form of enteric coated multiple unit with one or more prokinetic agents in the form of a powder or granules compressed into a tablet or in the form of capsule.<br>
3<br><br>
US Patent 6174548 describes an enteric coated formulation consisting of Omeprazole, a surface active agent, a filler, a binder and a alkaline agent (lysine or arginine). The enteric coating was applied without sub coating the core material.<br>
US Patent 6391342 describes an oral formulation comprising granules having Omeprazole, a disintegrant and a surfactant in a meltable matrix. The granules/pellets were sub coated and then enteric coating was applied.<br>
US Patent 6,428,810 describes an enteric-coated oral dosage form comprising of the magnesium salt of Omeprazole in the form of multiple unit dosage form. The sub coating on the core material was applied using hydroxypropyl cellulose as a polymer.<br>
US Patent 4786505 describes an enteric-coated omeprazole preparation containing a separating subcoat between the core material and the enteric coating. This preparation contains an alkaline core comprising omeprazole, a subcoating and an enteric coating. The present invention as disclosed herein does not use an alkaline agent. <br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an enteric coated benzimidiazole pharmaceutical formulation without a barrier coat between the drug core and the enteric coat.<br>
Further object of the invention is to create a dosage form that disperses into a multitude of small units in the stomach upon administration.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a multiple unit tablet dosage form, which are divisible and easy to handle. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a benzimidiazole formulation wherein the active medicament is sprayed onto a core material such as sugar or non-pareil seeds. These beads are then directly coated with an outer layer comprising of an enteric coating without a separating layer in between. The pellets so formed are filled in capsules. Even without the separating layer, the formulation so formed according to the present invention is stable. <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Non-pareil seeds or sugar crystals can be used for making the core material of<br>
the formulation. The core material for the individually enteric coating layered pellets<br>
4<br><br>
can be constituted according to known principles. The seeds, which are layered with the active substance, can be water insoluble seeds comprising different oxides, celluloses, organic polymers and other materials, alone or in mixtures thereof or water soluble seeds comprising different inorganic salts, sugars and other materials, alone or in mixtures thereof. The size of the seeds may vary between 0.1 and 4 mm and preferably between 0.1 and 2 mm.<br>
The core material is placed in a conventional coating pan or fluidized bed and then the active drug (a benzimidiazole such as omeprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole or one of their single enantiomers or their alkaline salts or their single enantiomers) along with additional constituents such as binders, anti-adherents, lubricant, surfactants and water are sprayed onto such core material.<br>
The seeds or sugar crystals layered with active substance are produced either by powder or solution/suspension layering or by spray coating or layering equipment. Before the seeds are layered, the active substance may be mixed with further components. Such components may be binders, lubricants, anti adherents or other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, alone or in mixtures, as processing aids.<br>
The binders used include, for example, celluloses, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose sodium, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and other pharmaceutically acceptable substances with cohesive properties, including natural gums.<br>
Suitable solubilizers having HLB value greater than 3 and preferably greater than 5, such as medium chain triglycerides not limited to Caprylocaryroyl Macrogol Glycerides (Labrasol), Lauroyl Macrogol glycerides (Gelucire), Oleoyl Macrogol Glycerides (Labrafil), Polyoxyethylene castor oil derivaties such as Polyoxyl 35 Castor oil (Cremophore EL), can be used. Suitable surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate or polysorbates (eg. Tween) can be used. Anti-adherent substances such as talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, silica gel or combinations thereof are used.<br>
The above items are mixed with water to obtain dispersion. The active drug is mixed with the above dispersion. The dispersion or solution of suitable binder is added to the drug dispersion. This dispersion is utilised to coat the non pareil seeds/ sugar crystals.<br>
5<br><br>
Enteric coating layer<br>
Enteric coating layers are applied onto the pellets or particles using a suitable coating technique such as pan coating or fluidized bed coating. The enteric coating layer material may be dispersed or dissolved in either water or in suitable organic solvents or a combination thereof or by using latex suspensions of said polymers. The percentage of w/w enteric coating layer may be from 10 to 90%, more preferably, from 05 to 55% w/w of the core material.<br>
The pellets so formed are then coated with an enteric coating material such as Poly (methacrylic acid, methyl methacrylate), commonly known as Eudragit L and S type, aqeous dispersion of Poly (methacrylic acid, ethyl acrylate) known as Eudrgit L 30D- 55, Poly (ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate) known as Eudrgit NE 30 D, Poly (ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, trimethylamonioethyl methacrylate chloride) known as Eudragit RS. Cellulosic enteric coating materials such as cellulose acetate Phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, carboxymethyl ethylcellulose. These pellets are then filled in capsules. The enteric coating can also be applied using water-based polymer dispersions, e.g. AquatericR™ (FMC Corporation), or suitable combination of any of these. The pH of the coating solution is adjusted by adding ammonia solution if required for neutralization.<br>
The enteric coating layer can optionally contain a pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizer such as cetanol, triacetin, triethyl citrate, glyceryl monostearate, polyethylene glycol, citric acid esters, phthalic acid esters, dibutyl succinate or similar plasticizers. The amount of plasticizer is optimized for each enteric coating layer formula, in relation to selected enteric coating layer polymer(s), selected plasticizer(s) and the applied amount of said polymer(s) and is usually above 10% by weight of the enteric coating layer polymer(s), preferably 15-50%, and more preferably 20-50%.<br>
Additives such as dispersants, colorants, pigments, polymers e.g. poly(ethylacrylate, methylmethacrylate), may also be included into the enteric coating layer(s).<br>
The pellets that have been so coated by the enteric coat are ready for dosing by various methods such as further packing in sachets or pellets formulated into tablets using various processes known in the art, filling into or hard gelatin capsules.<br>
