				<td>AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTINUOUSLY MOVING FLEXIBLE CONTAINERS FROM A ROTARY MACHINE TO A CONVEYOR<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for continuously moving flexible containers from a rotary machine to a conveyor, which is preferably a linear belt conveyor.<br>
The flexible containers are provided with spout and collar, and are normally moved hanging by said collar in the rotary machines.<br>
However, the problem arises of a suitable treatment of the containers exiting the rotary ma¬chines when the containers need to be transferred to types of machine or apparatuses that do no handle objects gripped by the collar.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the prior art, there are no solutions for example to transfer containers from a capper to a linear belt conveyor that conveys the container towards an area for their packaging.<br>
An additional problem is given by the fact that the release of flexible containers on a moving conveyor belt, if it occurs from a distance (height) of about 50 mm from the conveyor causes the bouncing of the containers, which assume such positions on the conveyor belt as not to allow their easy automatic handling downstream in the packaging station.<br>
It is therefore necessary for the placement on the belt to occur from a lower height, but thereby the means that release the containers on the belt interfere with the containers re¬leased on the belt and hence it is necessary to solve this problem.<br>
An object of the present invention is to eliminate the aforesaid problems making available a method and an apparatus for continuously moving flexible containers from a rotary machine to a conveyor in which the containers can assume correct positions on the conveyor without interfering with the means that deposited them thereon.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
Said objects are fully achieved by the apparatus and by the method of the present invention, which are characterised by the content of the appended claims and in particular in that the apparatus comprises in combination:<br>
-	a rotary structure provided peripherally with a plurality of pincers so shaped as to draw in¬dividual flexible containers from the rotary machine in the vertical position and then release them in the horizontal position on the conveyor;<br>
-	means for rotating the pincers by 90° from a position in which the jaws operate on a horizontal plane to a position in which they operate on a vertical plane and vice versa.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention<br>
The method comprises the steps of:<br>
-	drawing individual containers in the vertical position from the rotary machine;<br>
-	rotating the containers from the vertical position to a horizontal position, when transferring the containers to the conveyor;<br>
-	releasing the containers by free fall on the conveyor with simultaneous movement of the pincers in a region of non interference with the containers transferred on the conveyor.<br>
These and other characteristics shall become more readily apparent from the following de¬scription of a preferred embodiment, illustrated purely by way of non limiting example in the accompanying drawing tables, in which:<br>
-	figure 1 shows the apparatus in a partially sectioned frontal view;<br>
-	figures 2 and 3 illustrate details of figure 1;<br>
-	figure 4 shows a detail of the apparatus, in a front view without the pincers;<br>
-	figures 5 and 6 show the pincers, respectively in closed position (retaining the container) and open position (releasing the container).<br>
With reference to the figures, the number 1 indicates in its entirety an apparatus for transfer¬ring flexible containers 2 from a rotary machine 3 (in the specific case, a capper) to a con¬veyor 4 (in the specific case, a linear conveyor belt).<br>
The containers 2 are flexible containers shaped as envelopes, provided with spout and commonly called "pouches".<br>
These containers are normally manipulated and moved at the spout, more specifically at a collar 8 of the spout, according to the prior art.<br>
The apparatus 1 is a rotary apparatus comprising a rotating structure constituted by a plat¬form 5 on whose periphery is present a plurality of pincers 6 whose jaws 7 are so shaped as to grip the containers at their body and not at their collar 8.<br>
The pincers reach the region where the containers are to be withdrawn from the capper with jaws open, as shown in figure 6.<br>
A cam 17 operates during the rotation on a wheel 18 which actuates a transmission 13 whereto it is connected by means of rotoidal pair and consequently a shaft 9 for actuating the jaws is set in rotation, causing the activation of a lever mechanism 10 that serves to open/close the jaws 7.<br>
The jaws 7, moving on a horizontal plane, therefore close on the vertical body of the con¬tainer, allowing its grip.<br>
A pad 11 facilitates the retaining of the container in the correct position.<br>
The pads 11 are easily interchangeable (acting on a screw 12) in case of a change in the format of the containers to be treated.<br>
Once the container is gripped by the pincers 6 and thence it moves from the capper to the present apparatus, the pincers undergo a 90° rotation during the arc travelled towards the conveyor 4, whereupon the containers are lastly retained between the jaws 7 in horizontal lying position.<br>
The rotation of the pincers is produced, for example in the manner of what takes place in the sector of rotary rinsing machines, by means of a cam constituted by a rod 14 (that develops all around the apparatus) whereon an element 15 is engaged rotatably and slidably to cause a rotation of the pincers around an axis 16 until reaching the position shown in figure 3 with horizontal container.<br>
The rod 14 with the element 15 and the axis 16 constitute means for rotating the pincers by<br>
90° from a position in which the jaws 7 operate on a horizontal plane to a position in which they operate on a vertical plane and vice versa.<br>
The pincers retain the container at a distance from the conveyor belt 4 that is considerably less than 50 mm, to prevent the container from bouncing on the belt as a result of its release by free fall.<br>
Said distance, less than 20 mm, is preferably 15 mm.<br>
However, the release distance, markedly and originally reduced with respect to the prior art, makes it necessary to provide for a correct positioning of the pincers after release to prevent the container that advances on the conveyor after being released by the pincers from im¬pacting against the pincers, in particular against the downstream jaw, if they are still present in place.<br>
The present invention then provides for the pincers, as soon as the container is released, to be removed from the possible interference by means of 90° rotation in the opposite direction around the axis 16, i.e. returning to the initial position of gripping the container from the cap¬per.<br>
In particular, this second rotation from the horizontal position to the vertical position is car¬ried out, to avoid interference between the jaws 7 and the container, in open position (see FIG.6). The opening of the jaws 7 and the rotation around the axis 16 are simultaneous rota¬tions on orthogonal axes. Such movements are possible because the lever mechanism 10 operates in the centre of rotation of the axis 16.<br>
All is commanded by the rod 14.<br>
With reference to figure 3, the particular arrangement of the conveyor 4 and of the platform 5 make the device suitable and innovative with respect to aseptic technology. The platform 5 which through the jaws 7 moves the container in a sterile area always remains in the sterile area and the conveyor 4 that receives the container always remains in non sterile area, avoiding a contaminating effect. The device allows the sharp separation between the two areas, only the container as a result of the fall of about 20 mm moves from the sterile area to the non sterile area, delimited by the baffles 19.<br>
