				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to forming operations and more particularly to a<br>
front end for use in forming operations. Most particularly, this invention relates to an<br>
oxygen-fired front end for use in glass forming operations.<br>
In a forming operation, batch material is reduced to molten substance (for example,<br>
molten glass) by passing the batch material through a melting furnace, which is commonly<br>
referred to as a melter. The molten glass is delivered downstream from the melter through<br>
a system of channels and forehearths. This system of channels and forehearths is referred<br>
to as a front end. The front end serves as a conduit to deliver the molten glass to one or<br>
more production points. The front end also serves to cool and condition the molten glass<br>
prior to reaching the production points. These production points are referred to as forming<br>
positions. Each forming position includes a bushing for fiber forming operation or a gob<br>
cutter for a container forming operation. Bushings or gob cutters are secured to the<br>
forehearths via a forehearth steel.<br>
A conventional forehearth is provided with a firing system, which includes a<br>
plurality of burners. The burner functions to condition the molten glass G and maintain<br>
the molten glass G at a desired operational temperature. An example of a conventional<br>
forehearth 10 is shown in Fig. 1. The forehearth 10 includes a top or crown (not shown), a<br>
bottom (also not shown), and laterally spaced sidewalls 16. Portions of the forehearth 10<br>
above the level of the molten glass G are constructed from super structure refractory.<br>
Portions of the forehearth 10 below the level of the molten glass G are constructed from<br>
contact refractory (that is, glass contact refractory).<br>
A plurality of holes 18 is drilled through the sidewalls 16. The holes 18 are drilled<br>
through the super structure of the forehearth 10. The holes 18 are drilled at a right angle<br>
relative to the sidewalls 16. The holes 18 are adapted to receive burners 20. The holes 18<br>
are spaced about 4-5 inches (10.16-12.7 centimeters) from one another. Consequently, a<br>
large number of burners, manifolds, pipes, fittings and valves (not shown) are associated<br>
with air-gas mixture burners.<br>
In a conventional firing system, a source of air and a source of gas pass through<br>
regulators. The air and gas are mixed and then passed through a system of pipes to a<br>
plurality of burners, typically 20 to 100 burners. The burners are typically air-gas mixture<br>
burners. That is to say, the burners use the air as an oxidant for the combustion of the gas<br>
to provide heat to a zone, commonly referred to as a control zone. The front end has<br>
between six and sixty control zones, each complete with a gas control safety and pressure<br>
reduction system, combustion air blowers, and valves and regulators capable of controlling<br>
the temperature of the molten glass G between the melter and the forming position.<br>
An air-gas mixture firing system is not only costly to construct, it is inefficient to<br>
operate. An air-gas mixture firing system uses 30 to 75 cubic feet per hour (0.850 to 2.124<br>
cubic meter per hour) of gas to heat a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) section of channel with<br>
an air-gas mixture. It requires about 10 cubic feet (0.283 cubic meter) of air for<br>
combustion of 1 cubic foot (0.0283 cubic meter) of natural gas. The air must be heated<br>
from an ambient temperature to the same temperature as the exhaust gas stream. About 70<br>
to 85 percent of the energy used heats the air to the exhaust gas temperature, leaving less<br>
than 15 to 30 percent of the energy to be transferred as available heat (that is, heat<br>
available for the glass forming operation). Thus, an air-gas mixture firing system has<br>
minimum efficiency of combustion.<br>
In addition to having a minimum efficiency of combustion, an air-gas mixture<br>
firing system is an inefficient means to heat the molten glass G. The flame temperature of<br>
an air-gas mixture burner in the air-gas mixture firing system reaches about 3500°F<br>
(1926.67°C). However, the optical properties of the molten glass G and products of<br>
combustion limit the amount of radiant energy that penetrates the molten glass G. This<br>
causes the temperature gradient to be high vertically through the molten glass G. The only<br>
way to control the temperature distribution is to control the profile of the burners.<br>
To overcome the deficiencies of an air-gas mixture firing system, the air-gas<br>
mixture burners have been replaced with concentric-type oxygen-gas mixture burners. A<br>
typical oxygen-gas firing system is supplied by BH-F)(ENG1NEERING) LTD. of England.<br>
The system uses burners commonly referred to as oxygen-gas burners. Oxygen-gas<br>
burners use oxygen (for example, typically 90 to 99 percent purity with an impurity being a<br>
combination of nitrogen and argon) in a high purity as an oxidant and fossil fuel for a<br>
combustible hydrocarbon supply. The oxygen-gas burner ignites the mixture of oxygen<br>
and gas at the point of ignition or combustion. The oxygen-gas burners are placed 4-5<br>
inches (10.16-12.7 centimeters) apart, similar to the spacing to the air-gas mixture burners<br>
described above.<br>
The oxygen-gas burners reduce CO2 and NOx emissions, making these burners<br>
more environmentally friendly and possibly reducing greenhouse gas taxes. Oxygen-gas<br>
burners fire more efficiently by reducing the waste gas stream and providing more<br>
available heat for use in the glass forming operation. This holds true because an oxygen-<br>
gas burner requires less volume (that is, 2 cubic feet (0.0566 cubic meter)) for combustion<br>
of 1 cubic foot (0.0283 cubic meter) of natural gas. Consequently, exhaust gases (that is,<br>
the stream of gas used to heat the oxygen-gas mixture) are reduced by about 73 percent.<br>
As a result, about 65 percent of the energy in an oxygen-gas mixture firing system is used<br>
to transfer available heat.<br>
In addition to having a greater efficiency of combustion, an oxygen-gas mixture<br>
firing system is a more efficient means to heat the molten glass. The flame temperature of<br>
an oxygen-gas burner is about 4500°F-4800°F (2482.22°C-2648.89°C). At this<br>
temperature, the flame and products of combustion radiate energy at wavelengths that the<br>
molten glass can absorb. This provides uniform glass temperature horizontally on the<br>
surface of the molten glass and vertically through the molten glass.<br>
Although an oxygen-gas mixture firing system provides uniform glass temperature,<br>
it requires an extensive number of complex and costly components. For example, the<br>
current cost of an oxygen-gas burner is about $1000 (903.97 Euro). A conventional<br>
oxygen-gas mixture system- uses about six oxygen-gas burners per foot (30.48<br>
centimeters), resulting in a cost of about $6,000 (5423.80 Euro) per foot (30.48<br>
centimeters).<br>
What is needed is a front end that reduces fuel consumption by using a low-cost<br>
system for firing forehearths with a combination of gas and oxygen.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed toward a front end for a glass forming operation.<br>
The front end comprises an open ended channel and at least one burner. The channel has<br>
at least one surface. The surface has at least one hole therein. The burner is oriented in<br>
the hole at an acute angle relative to the surface.<br>
The present invention is also directed toward a front end comprising a channel<br>
having a top and a pair of sidewalls each having a surface. At least one hole is in at least<br>
one of the surfaces. The hole is at an acute angle relative to at least one surface. The<br>
burner is an oxygen-fired burner.<br>
The present invention is further directed toward a front end comprising a channel<br>
having a top and sidewalls each having a super structure surface constructed of refractory<br>
material. The channel has an upstream end and a downstream end. At least one of the<br>
surfaces has a plurality of holes therein. The holes extend at an acute angle relative to at<br>
least one surface and in a plane extending between the upstream end and the downstream<br>
end and perpendicular to at least one surface. Oxygen-fired burners extend axially through<br>
corresponding holes.<br>
Various objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in Fig. 2 a front end of a glass<br>
forming operation. The front end comprises an open channel and a forehearth downstream<br>
of the open channel. To simplify the description, the channel and forehearth will be<br>
cooperatively described as a channel 22A. The channel 22A is adapted to deliver molten<br>
substance (for example, molten glass G) from a melter to a point of production (that is, a<br>
forming position). Neither the melter nor the forming position is shown.<br>
Molten glass G does not contact an upper portion of the channel 22A. That is to<br>
say, an upper portion of the channel 22A is above the molten glass level (that is, the<br>
molten glass level L shown in Figs. 4 and 5). Consequently, this portion can be<br>
constructed from relatively inexpensive refractory material (that is, a super structure<br>
refractory material, such as silica, mullite, or other materials that are not required to<br>
withstand corrosive effects of molten glass G).<br>
A lower portion of the channel 22A is below the glass level L and thus comes into<br>
contact with the molten glass G. Consequently, this portion of the channel 22A is<br>
constructed of a more costly glass contact refractory material. A ceramic refractory<br>
material (that is, zircon, chromic oxide, or other suitable material) is a suitable glass<br>
contact refractory material because it can sustain the corrosive effects of molten glass G.<br>
The channel 22A may comprise a top or crown (not shown), a bottom (also not<br>
shown), and sidewalls 28A. The channel 22A has an upstream end, generally indicated at<br>
30A, and a downstream end, generally indicated at 32A. An open end 34 may be provided<br>
at the downstream end 32A of the channel 22A. An end wall 36A may be provided at the<br>
upstream end 30A of the channel 22A. One or more glass orifices 38 may be provided in<br>
the bottom of the channel 22A proximate, adjacent or close to the end wall 36A. The<br>
forehearth of the front end, as introduced above, is that portion of the channel 22A having<br>
the end wall 36A and the glass orifices 38 in the bottom.<br>
The sidewalls 28A each define a surface 40. The surfaces 40 have at least one hole<br>
42 A therein. The hole 42A may be drilled in the super structure refractory material of<br>
existing front ends with a refractory core drill. New front ends can be constructed with<br>
built-in burner blocks having holes 42C formed frierein (see Fig. 4). A burner 44 is<br>
provided in the hole 42A. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of holes<br>
42 A is provided and a burner 44 is provided in each of the holes 42 A. The burners 44 are<br>
preferably oxygen-fired burners, wherein oxygen (in high purity) and gas are mixed at a<br>
point of ignition or combustion. That is to say, the burners use oxygen as an oxidant and<br>
fossil fuel for a combustible hydrocarbon supply. Such burners are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art of the invention.<br>
The burners 44 are positioned above the glass level L (shown in Figs. 4 and 5).<br>
The burners 44 are oriented in a plane (for example, a substantially horizontal plane)<br>
perpendicular to the surfaces 40 and at an acute angle relative to the surfaces 40. The<br>
burners 44 are pointed toward the downstream end 32A of the channel 22A at an angle<br>
between about 5 degrees to about 85 degrees relative to the surfaces 40, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Alternatively, the burners 44 can be pointed toward the upstream end 30A of the channel<br>
22A at an angle between about 95 degrees to about 175 degrees relative to the surfaces 40,<br>
similar to the burners 44 shown in Fig. 3. This embodiment will be described in greater<br>
detail in the description hereinbelow.<br>
Continuing with reference to Fig. 2, the burners 44 may be staggered or<br>
alternatively spaced so that opposing burners 44 in the opposing sidewalls 28A are<br>
laterally offset or do not laterally align (do not vertically align when viewing Fig. 2) with<br>
one another. The flame temperature of an oxygen-fired burner is about 4200°F-5200°F<br>
(2315.56°C-2871.11°C). However, the flame is preferably very small. Consequently, the<br>
flame does not directly contact the sidewalls 28A. However, heat radiating from the flame<br>
is quite substantial. Although the flame does not directly contact the sidewalls 28A, the<br>
sidewalls 28A are heated sufficiently by convection or heat otherwise radiating from the<br>
flame. This radiant heat is sufficient to properly condition the molten glass G and<br>
maintain the molten glass G at a desired temperature without compromising the integrity<br>
of the channel 22A by exposing the channel 22A to excessively high temperatures. This<br>
holds true even if the burners 44 are spaced about 1 foot (0.3048 meter) to about 5 feet<br>
(1:24 meter) apart from one another.<br>
Although not shown, it may be desirable to provide a hole 43A in the end wall 36A<br>
of the channel 22A. This hole 43A may be used as'an exhaust hole or to support another<br>
burneer 44 if more heat is needed in this region for conditioning the molten glass G or to<br>
maintain the molten glass G at a desired temperature.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 3. This embodiment is<br>
similar to the embodiment described above except the burners 44 are provided in pairs. In<br>
this embodiment of the invention, opposing burners 44 are not staggered or alternatively<br>
spaced. Instead, the opposing burners 44 are laterally aligned (vertically aligned when<br>
viewing Fig. 3) with one another. In this embodiment of the invention, more uniform<br>
distribution of heat may be provided.<br>
In either of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the burners 44 can be<br>
oriented so that the flames of opposing burners 44 cause one another to reflect toward the<br>
sidewalls 28A, 28B of the channel 22A, 22B. This is illustrated diagrammatically by the<br>
conical shaped pattern shown in Fig. 3. It; should also be appreciated by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art that the burners 44 in the foregoing embodiments could be angled<br>
downward. For example, the burners 44 could be angled downward at an angle in a range<br>
of about 0 degrees to about 20 degrees.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 4. The channel 22C<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention has a surface 46 defined by the top 24C of<br>
the channel 22C. This surface 46 has at least one hole 42C therein. A burner 44 is<br>
provided in the hole 42C. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of holes<br>
4?. C is provided and a burner 44 is provided in each of the holes 42C. The burners 44 are<br>
preferably oxygen-fired burners.<br>
The burners 44 are oriented in a plane (for example, a substantially vertical plane)<br>
perpendicular to the surface 46 and at an acute angle relative to the surface 46. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the burners 44 are pointed toward the upstream<br>
end 30C of the channel 22d at an angle between about 5 degrees to about 85 degrees<br>
relative to the surface 46, as shown in Fig. 4. Alternatively, the burners 44 can be pointed<br>
toward the downstream end 32C of the channel 22C at an angle between about 95 degrees<br>
to about 175 degrees relative to the surface 46, similar to the burners 44 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
As shown in the drawings, a hole 43 C may be provided in the end wall 36C of the<br>
channel 22C. The hole 43C may be used as an exhaust vent for the channel 22C. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, this hole 43C is used to support another burner 44<br>
if are heat is needed in this region for conditioning the molten glass G or to maintain the<br>
molten glass G at a desired temperature. Although, the burner 44 in the hole 43C in the<br>
end wall 36C is preferably oriented at an angle of about 15 degrees relative the top surface<br>
49 has shown in Fig. 4, other angles may be suitable for carrying out the invention. For<br>
example, if the hole 43C is in the end wall 36C, the burner 44 can be at any angle ranging<br>
from about 5 degrees to about 90 degrees (or horizontal) relative to the end wall 36C. If<br>
the hole 43C is in the junction of the end wall 36C and the top surface 46, the burner 44<br>
can be at any angle ranging from about 5 degrees to about 85 degrees relative to the end<br>
wall 36C.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 5. The channel 22D<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention is a hybrid channel having an intermediate<br>
cooling channel 48 and diametrically disposed burners 44. Although the burners 44 shown<br>
are provided in the top 24D of the channel 22D, the burners 44 may be provided in the<br>
side walls 28D. This embodiment of the invention is useful in wider firing zones where<br>
some cooling is desired, such as in glass container forming operations. Such operations<br>
typicallyrequire channels that measure about 5 feet (1.524 meter) wide,<br>
In each of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the burners 44 should be<br>
oriecated so that the burner flame is not pushed into the top 24C, 24D or the sidewalls 28A,<br>
28B,28D. Moreover, the burners 44 should also be separated and the flame tempered so<br>
that excessive levels of heat are not reached within the channel 22A, 22B, 22C, 22D. This<br>
avoids the risk of overheating the top 24C, 24D, the sidewalls 28A, 28B, 28D, and/or the<br>
burner nozzle, resulting in damage to the refractory material or burners 44.<br>
In each of the foregoing embodiments of the invention, the flow of oxygen is<br>
preferably about 20 to 200 cubic feet per hour (0.566 to 5.663 cubic meter per hour) for<br>
each burner 44. Any gas that requires this amount of flow for complete combustion may<br>
be suitable for carrying out the invention. The oxygen demand should be the same<br>
into endent of the gas used.<br>
The front end of the invention is advantageous because it uses fewer burners, fewer<br>
valves, fewer fittings, and a smaller number of associated manifolds and pipes. Firing is<br>
more efficient, therefore less fuel is consumed. Consequently, fuel pipe sizes are reduced.<br>
There is also a large reduction of pipe sizes for piping oxygen as opposed to air (for<br>
capable, from 8, 6, or 4 inches (20.32, 15.24, or 10.16 centimeters) to 1 or 2 inches (5.08<br>
or 2.54 centimeters) or smaller pipe). Installation costs are also reduced.<br>
In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the principle and mode of<br>
operatino of this invention have been explained and illustrated in its preferred<br>
embodiment. However, it must be understood that this invention may be practiced<br>
of exise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or<br>
