				<td>METHOD FOR ANALYSING PRESSURE SIGNALS DERIVABLE FROM A BODY<br>
CAVITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for analysing pressure-signals derivable<br>
from pressure measurements on or in a body of a human being or animal,<br>
comprising the steps of sampling said signals at specific intervals, converting the<br>
pressure signals into pressure-related digital data with a time reference, as defined<br>
in the preamble of attached claims 1 and 34. The invention provides for<br>
monitoring and of pressure within body cavities in human body or animal body,<br>
e.g. intracranial pressure and blood pressure, and even in cavities such as e.g.<br>
cerebrospinal fluid space. The invention provides for analysis of pressure signals<br>
subsequent to sampling, recordal, storage and processing of pressure measurement<br>
signals, and thereby quantitative analysis.<br>
Related Art<br>
The clinical use of intracranial pressure monitoring was first described by Janny in<br>
1950 and Lundberg in 1960.<br>
In the clinical setting, the question may be whether a continuous pressure recording<br>
of several hours is normal, borderline or abnormal. Continuous intracranial<br>
pressure curves usually are evaluated by calculation of mean intracranial pressure.<br>
With regard to rises in pressure most authors identify so-called pressure waves:<br>
Lundberg's A waves (50-10 mmHg lasting 5-20 minutes), B waves (up to 50<br>
mmHg with a frequency 0.5-2/min), and C waves (up to 20 mmHg with a frequency<br>
4-8/min). However, the description of such waves is quite subjective and based on<br>
a morphological description of the waves. Actually the various authors differently<br>
describe such waves.<br>
The present invention deals with strategies to analyze single pulse pressure waves,<br>
and make analysis of these waves available to the daily clinical practice. The<br>
fluctuations of intracranial pressure arise from cardiac and respiratory effects. The<br>
intracranial pressure cardiac waves or cerebrospinal fluid pulse waves result from<br>
the contractions of the left cardiac ventricle. The intracranial pressure wave or the<br>
cerebrospinal fluid pulse wave resemble the arterial blood pressure wave, that is<br>
characterized by a systolic rise followed by a diastolic decline and a dicrotic notch.<br>
In addition, changes in pressures associated with the respiratory cycle affect the<br>
intracranial pressure wave. The morphology of the intracranial pulse pressure wave<br>
depends on the arterial inflow, venous outflow, as well as the state of the<br>
intracranial contents. The single pulse pressure waves of intracranial pressure<br>
include three peaks that are consistently present, corresponding with the arterial<br>
pulse waves. For a single pulse pressure wave the maximum peak is termed P1 or<br>
top of the percussion wave. During the declining phase of the wave, there are two<br>
peaks namely the second peak (P2), often termed the tidal wave, and the third peak<br>
(P3), often termed the dicrotic wave. Between the tidal and dicrotic waves is the<br>
dicrotic notch that corresponds to arterial dicrotic notch. In the present application,<br>
the amplitude of the first peak (?PI) is defined as the pressure, difference between<br>
the diastolic minimum pressure and the systolic maximum pressure, the latency of<br>
the first peak (?TI) is defined as the time interval when pressures increases from<br>
diastolic minimum to systolic maximum. The rise time (?PI/?TI)) is defined as<br>
the coefficient obtained by dividing the amplitude with the latency. The<br>
morphology of the single pulse pressure wave is intimately related to elastance and<br>
compliance. Elastance is the change in pressure as a function of a change in<br>
volume, and describes the effect of a change in volume on intracranial pressure.<br>
Compliance is the inverse of elastance and represents the change in volume as a<br>
function of a change in pressure. Therefore, compliance describes the effect of a<br>
change in pressure on craniospinal volume. Elastance is most useful clinically as<br>
elastance describes the effect of changes in intracranial volume on intracranial<br>
pressure. The relationship between intracranial pressure and volume was described<br>
in 1966 by Langfitt and showed an exponential curve, where the slope of any part<br>
of the curve resembles the rise time of a single wave (that is ?P/?T or change in<br>
pressure/change in volume). The curve is termed the pressure-volume curve or the<br>
elastance curve. The horizontal part of the curve is the period of spatial<br>
compensation whereas the vertical portion is the period of spatial decompensation.<br>
When elastance increases also the amplitude of a single pulse pressure wave<br>
increases due to an increase in the pressure response to a bolus of blood from the<br>
heart. It has, however, not been possible to take the knowledge of single wave<br>
parameters into daily clinical practice.<br>
Another reason for the less widespread use of continuous intracranial pressure<br>
monitoring in not critically ill patients is that there are still no generally accepted<br>
methods for analyzing intracranial pressure. Though there are large amounts of<br>
experimental data concerning single pulse pressure waves and their relationship to<br>
the pressure volume curve, the clinical application of this knowledge has not been<br>
straightforward. During continuous intracranial pressure monitoring in clinical<br>
practice the single pulse pressure waves are not assessed and used in the decision<br>
making. An indirect approach has been Fast Fourier Transformation or spectral<br>
analysis to assess the frequency distribution of the various waves. Strategies to<br>
examine the pressure volume relationship in a single patient have involved infusion<br>
of fluid to the cerebrospinal fluid space or inflation of a balloon, but these<br>
strategies are invasive, and neither involve assessment of single pulse pressure<br>
waves. In the clinical context, methods to explore the pressure-volume<br>
relationships or elastance by analysis of the pressure curve are lacking. There are<br>
no strategies that make it possible to determine accurately where a single patient is<br>
on the elastance curve.<br>
In the intensive care unit, continuous intracranial pressure monitoring usually<br>
presents the pressures as mean pressure in numerical values, or as a curve that has<br>
to be visually analyzed. Though single waves may be displayed on the monitor,<br>
strategies to explore trends in changes of single wave characteristics are lacking.<br>
Furthermore, strategies to continuously examine compliance solely on the basis of<br>
the pressure curves have not been established.<br>
There is a close relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure as<br>
the intracranial pressure waves are built up from the blood pressure waves.<br>
Simultaneous assessment of intracranial pressure and blood pressure provides<br>
several advantages, for instance by calculation of the cerebral perfusion pressure<br>
(that is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure). The assessment of<br>
cerebral perfusion pressure represents a critical parameter in the monitoring of<br>
critically ill patients. Assessment of blood pressure per se also has a major place in<br>
daily clinical practice, including both assessments of diastolic and systolic<br>
pressures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
On this background the applicant developed technical solutions for monitoring<br>
pressures in patients that are free to move about, for accurate digital sampling and<br>
analysis of pressure recordings, as well as a technical solution for comparing<br>
pressure recordings within or between individuals.<br>
An apparatus was developed allowing direct communication between the pressure<br>
transducer and a computer (that is add-on to computers such as medical device<br>
computers, vital signs patient monitors, or as a stand-alone system for sampling of<br>
pressure recordings). Furthermore, a new algorithm for sampling, analysing and<br>
presenting pressure recordings was developed and incorporated in computer<br>
software. The computer software records, samples, analyses, and provides various<br>
outputs of the pressure recordings. The technical solution may be applied to a<br>
variety of pressures such as intracranial pressures (or cerebrospinal fluid<br>
pressures), blood pressures, or other body cavity pressures. Invasive or non-<br>
invasive sensors may record pressures.<br>
With regard to sampling, analysis and presentation of single pulse pressure waves,<br>
relative differences in pressures and relative time differences are computed. The<br>
analysis is not relative to the zero level or the atmospheric pressure, therefore the<br>
results of data analysis are not affected by the zero level or drift of zero level.<br>
With regard to single pulse pressure waves, the invention provides measurement<br>
and analysis of the following parameters:<br>
a) Minimum is defined as the diastolic minimum pressure of the single wave, or as<br>
the valley of the wave.<br>
b) Maximum is defined as the systolic maximum pressure of the single wave, or<br>
defined as the peak of the wave.<br>
c) Amplitude is defined as the pressure difference between the systolic maximum<br>
pressure and the diastolic minimum pressures during the series of increasing<br>
pressures of the single wave.<br>
d) Latency is defined as the time of the single wave when the sequence of pressures<br>
increases from minimum pressure to maximum pressure.<br>
e) Rise time is defined as the relationship between amplitude divided by latency,<br>
and is synonymous with the rise time coefficient.<br>
f) Wavelength is defined as the duration of the single pulse pressure wave when<br>
pressures changes from minimum and back to minimum, and reflects the heart rate.<br>
As mentioned in the Related Art section, amplitude, latency and rise in the present<br>
invention is referring to the first peak (P1). This does not represent a limitation of<br>
the scope of the invention, however, as amplitude, latency and rise time also may<br>
be calculated for the second (P2) and third (P3) peaks as well.<br>
By means of the invention the applicant showed that quantitative analysis of<br>
characteristics of single pulse pressure waves revealed important and new<br>
information about the pressures. Both these latter parameters are important for<br>
assessment of abnormal pressures. The applicant has demonstrated (not published)<br>
that parameters of the single pulse pressure waves analyzed and presented<br>
quantitatively, provide information about compliance and elastance.<br>
The quantitative method was developed for various pressures such as blood<br>
pressure, intracranial pressure (subdural, epidural, intraparenchymatous, or<br>
cerebrospinal fluid pressure), and cerebral perfusion pressure.<br>
Furthermore, the quantitative method was developed for offering different types of<br>
data presentations:<br>
a) matrix presentations of numbers or percentages of single pulse pressure waves<br>
with pre-selected characteristics during a recording period,<br>
b) graphical presentations of single pulse pressure waves with the opportunity to<br>
compare single waves, either between individuals, against a reference material or<br>
within the same individual at different time intervals,<br>
c) various types of statistical handling of the data are possible.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, the method for analyzing comprises the inventive<br>
steps of:<br>
identifying from said digital data features related to single pressure waves in said<br>
pressure signals,<br>
- said identifying step including determination of a minimum pressure value<br>
related to diastolic minimum value and a maximum pressure value related to<br>
systolic maximum value, and<br>
- determining at least one parameter of the single wave parameters elected from<br>
the group of: pressure amplitude = ?P = [(maximum pressure value) —<br>
(minimum pressure value)], latency (?T), rise time or rise time coefficient =<br>
?P/?T, and wavelength of the single wave, and<br>
- comprising the further step of:<br>
determining numbers of said single pressure waves occurring during a given<br>
time sequence,<br>
wherein said determining of numbers includes:<br>
determining numbers of single pressure waves with pre-selected values of one<br>
or more of said single pressure wave parameters during said given time sequence,<br>
and<br>
further includes determining numbers of single pressure waves with pre-<br>
selected combinations of two or more of said single pressure wave parameters<br>
during said given time sequence.<br>
Further embodiments of this first aspect of the invention are defined in sub-claims<br>
2-33.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, the method for analyzing comprises the<br>
inventive steps of:<br>
wherein the method comprises the further steps of:<br>
- identifying from said digital data features related to absolute pressures relative<br>
to atmospheric pressure,<br>
recording repeatedly at specific time intervals, intermittently , in any reiterated<br>
manner, or continuously absolute pressure data to create a pressure trend plot<br>
against time,<br>
- determining from said recording a number of different pressure levels and<br>
duration thereof, and<br>
presenting the numbers of levels of various time durations in said matrix<br>
format.<br>
Further embodiments of this second aspect of the invention are defined in sub-<br>
claims 35 - 43.<br>
In the context of the invention there is disclosed apparatus to provide for recordal<br>
of signals indicative of the intracranial pressure or blood pressure from various<br>
sources of signals, that is invasive implanted microtransducers and non-invasive<br>
devices using acoustic or ultrasonic signals, or other signals recorded by non-<br>
invasive devices. Thus, the algorithm for analysis of pressures may be used<br>
whether pressure signals are derived from invasive or non-invasive devices.<br>
The invention is useful for monitoring intracranial pressures without being<br>
dependent on the zero level (i.e. calibration against the atmospheric pressure). This<br>
is particularly important for pressure sampling by means of non-invasive sensors.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a solution for analysis and presentation of<br>
continuous intracranial pressure recordings obtained by non-invasive sensors.<br>
Through use of proper software it is possible to perform quantitative analysis and<br>
presentation of continuous pressure recordings representing e.g. intracranial<br>
pressure, blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. The software has several<br>
options for quantitative description of the data, including calculation of a matrix of<br>
pressure elevations of different levels and durations, or a matrix of pressure<br>
changes of different levels and durations, or a matrix of numbers of single pulse<br>
pressure wave parameters with selected characteristics.<br>
The main objectives of the invention are related to intracranial pressure and blood<br>
pressure, but this is not a limitation on the scope of the invention. The invention<br>
can also be utilized in connection with pressure sensors measuring pressure in<br>
other body cavities (such as the cerebrospinal fluid cavities).<br>
In a process for obtaining pressure signals and carrying out analysis thereof, one or<br>
more pressure sensors are applied to a patient and the pressure signals from the<br>
sensors are sampled at selected intervals. The sampled signals are converted to<br>
digital form and stored along with a time reference that makes it possible to<br>
evaluate the change of pressure over time. The time reference may be stored as part<br>
of the digital value, or it may be associated with the memory position, or memory<br>
address, at which the pressure value is stored. The stored sample values are then,<br>
according to this embodiment of the invention, analyzed in order to generate a<br>
presentation of at least one of the following: number of pressure elevations with<br>
any selected combination of level and duration; number of pressure changes with<br>
any selected combination of level difference and duration of change; and number of<br>
pulse pressure waves with preselected characteristics regarding minimum,<br>
maximum, amplitude, latency and rise time. This allows for various sampling rates<br>
and duration of measuring periods. Assessment of single pulse pressure waves<br>
preferentially requires a sampling rate of 100 Hz or above. As an alternative to<br>
numbers, percentages may be computed. Any point of the single waves may be<br>
calculated, and different parameters of the waves may be computed. There is a<br>
fundamental difference between computation of number of pressure elevations with<br>
any selected combination of level and duration and number of pulse pressure waves<br>
with preselected characteristics regarding minimum, maximum, amplitude, latency<br>
and rise time. One way is thereby to compute pressures relative to a zero level (i.e.<br>
atmospheric pressure), whereas a second way is to compute relative differences in<br>
pressures and time and therefore is independent on the zero level.<br>
In the context of the invention there is provided a system for handling single pulse<br>
pressure waves in a way that pressures from a single subject may be superimposed<br>
on the pressure-volume (elastance) curve providing information about the<br>
elastance. This solution provides one of several strategies of early detection of<br>
decompensation of pressures, before the conventional methods.<br>
In the present disclosure there is described a system for quantitative and accurate<br>
comparisons of pressure recordings/curves when assessing pressure in a body<br>
cavity or blood pressure. Comparisons may be made between different continuous<br>
pressure curves that include different recording periods, different heart rates, as<br>
well as different zero levels. Comparisons of continuous pressure recordings may<br>
be made both between individuals and within individuals (that is before and after<br>
treatment or comparisons of pressure recordings at different time intervals). This<br>
system makes use of a newly developed algorithm (not further disclosed) in a<br>
computer software. The algorithm includes quantitative approaches for analysis of<br>
the pressure recordings and strategies to present the recordings. The system may be<br>
integrated in commercially available pressure transducer devices, in computer<br>
servers or in medical device computers or in the portable apparatus for pressure<br>
monitoring described here.<br>
The technical solution of comparing various continuous pressure curves involves<br>
standardisation procedures. The numbers/percentages during a given recording<br>
period may be standardized to numbers/percentages during a standardized<br>
recording period (e.g. one or 10 hours) and a standardized heart rate. For different<br>
individuals the quantitative data for a given recording period may be standardised<br>
to a selected recording period (for example numbers/percentages during one<br>
minute, one hour or 10 hours recording period), as well as standardised to a<br>
selected heart rate (for example heart rate of 60 each minute). Thereby, continuous<br>
pressure recordings for different individuals may be compared.<br>
In the context of the invention, there is disclosed a system for performing the<br>
analysis according to the method. The system may be in the form of a suitably<br>
programmed computer, or dedicated equipment particularly designed for<br>
performing this analysis. The system includes a communication interface for<br>
receiving a set of digital pressure sample values, a memory for storing these values,<br>
and a processor for performing the analysis described above. The system further<br>
includes a video interface that is controlled by the processor and that is capable of<br>
generating a visual presentation of the result of any analysis performed by the<br>
processor. The visual presentation will be presented on a display. The system also<br>
comprises input means for allowing a user to change the parameters of the<br>
performed analysis. This implies that the system may be integrated in different<br>
computer servers, medical device computers or vital sign monitors. Therefore, the<br>
system described here represents no limitation by which the invention may be<br>
applied.<br>
The output computed by the software may be presented in a number of ways,<br>
including matrix of numbers, graphical presentations, and comparisons of pressures<br>
in an individual against a reference material or against previous recordings of the<br>
individual.<br>
Further exemplifying features and embodiments of the invention as well as other<br>
aspects of and relations thereto will now be described in the following description<br>
with reference to the attached drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates in a block diagram a system for measuring pressure in a body<br>
cavity of a patient. The main components of this system includes a pressure sensor<br>
16, a pressure transducer 2, a portable apparatus for measuring and storing pressure<br>
values 1, and a network station such as a personal computer 6 for receiving and<br>
processing registered pressure values. The apparatus 1 is a digital system with a<br>
central processing unit 8 for sampling and storing pressure measurements in a<br>
patient, such as intracranial pressure, blood pressure or pressure in other body<br>
cavities or blood pressure. In the following example an embodiment for measuring<br>
intracranial pressure will be described, but it must be understood that this is not a<br>
limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
Most commercially available sensors 16 give an analogue signal on the basis of a<br>
mechanical action on the sensor. Within the pressure transducer 2 the signals from<br>
the sensor is converted to a signal that may either be a voltage or current signal.<br>
The pressure transducer 2 then produces a continuous voltage or current signal.<br>
The voltage or current signals from the transducer are further processed within the<br>
signal conditioner 5. The analogue signals are converted to digital signals within<br>
the analogue to digital converter 7. Certainly various modifications are possible.<br>
When data are collected from for example a vital signs monitor both the pressure<br>
transducer 2 and the analogue to digital converter 7 may be built into the vital signs<br>
monitor. The digital signals are handled according to the invention.<br>
The apparatus 1 may be constructed in a number of ways. The embodiment<br>
described below is based on a unit with a central processing unit 8 operating in<br>
accordance with instructions stored in memory 9 and communicating with the<br>
various parts of the apparatus over a common data bus 14. However, a number of<br>
variations are possible. Instead of using a central processing unit 8 and instructions<br>
stored in memory 9, the functionality of the apparatus 1 could be constructed<br>
directly in hardware, e.g. as ASICs. The apparatus represents no limitation for the<br>
use of the system for the analysis and presentation of pressures described here.<br>
The main components of the apparatus 1 are then the analog to digital converter 7,<br>
which converts the received analog measuring signals to digital, the data memory<br>
9, which receives the digitized values from the analog to digital converter 7 and<br>
stores them. An input/output interface 15 allows data stored in the memory 9 to be<br>
transferred to the network station or personal computer 6 for processing. The<br>
apparatus preferably includes a galvanic element 3 protecting the patient from the<br>
electric circuitry of the apparatus, a signal conditioner 5 either to the input or the<br>
output of the analog to digital converter 7, an input control 10 for controlling<br>
operation and adjusting settings of the apparatus, a display unit 12, and an alarm<br>
unit 13. Input control 10, display 12 and alarm unit 13 are connected to and in<br>
communication with the central processing unit 8 and/or other parts of the<br>
apparatus such as ASICs, display drivers, and power sensors (not shown).<br>
After being received by the apparatus over a connector 4 to which the pressure<br>
transducer 2 is connected, analog measuring signals are sent to a signal conditioner<br>
5. Preferably a galvanic element 3 is positioned between the interface 4 and the<br>
signal conditioner 5, representing a security element preventing electrical energy<br>
from being sent retrograde to the patient. Signal processing in the conditioner 5<br>
modifies the signal-to-noise ratio. This is required since a high degree of noise can<br>
be expected for instance during walking. The signal conditioner 5 may be an analog<br>
filter. Alternatively, the signal conditioner 5 may be a digital filter operating under<br>
control of the central processing unit 8. The signal conditioner 5 will then be<br>
positioned following the conversion of the sampled signal from analog to digital.<br>
Besides, the software computes the number of artifacts during a recording period,<br>
and the artifact ratio. The program includes an option for excluding recordings<br>
when the artifact ratio is above a selected level.<br>
As has already been mentioned, the apparatus 1 is here described as receiving<br>
signals indicative of the intracranial pressure from sensors 16 implanted within the<br>
skull. However, the apparatus may also incorporate a signal conditioner 5 for<br>
processing signals from non-invasive devices such as acoustic, ultrasonic or<br>
Doppler devices. Whether the entire apparatus 1 must be constructed with a signal<br>
conditioner 5 for a specific purpose or whether the same signal conditioner 5<br>
allows for different uses, with or without re-programming, is dependent on<br>
implementation and specific needs. If the apparatus 1 is intended to work with<br>
various sensors 16 with various levels of sensitivity, the signal conditioner should<br>
be adjustable in a manner that allows operation with the desired sensors and to<br>
adapt the output range to the various sensors to the input range of the analog to<br>
digital converter 7. In this case the signal conditioner 5 must obviously be<br>
connected between the input of the apparatus 1 and the analog to digital converter<br>
7.<br>
The pressures may be recorded with variable sampling frequency, e.g. from about 1<br>
- 10 Hz up to at least 150 Hz (most preferably between 100 and 200 Hz). When<br>
single pulse pressure waves are monitored, the sampling frequency preferentially is<br>
100 Hz or above. The minimum memory space should then allow storing of<br>
recordings at least 150 times a second for at least 48 hrs (26 920 000 recordings).<br>
Via a connector 11, data may be transferred to the personal computer 6 for<br>
analysis. The connector 11 may be a serial port, and the apparatus will preferably<br>
comprise an input/output interface 15 converting the internal signal format for the<br>
apparatus 1 to a format for communication over said connector 11.<br>
The various units of the apparatus are shown as communicating over a common<br>
data bus 14, but it should be noted that the various components may be<br>
interconnected in other ways.<br>
The apparatus 1 has been described above with only one channel for receiving<br>
pressure signals from one pressure sensor. The apparatus may, as mentioned<br>
before, include one or more additional channels for receiving signals from<br>
additional pressure sensors.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for measuring and analyzing pressure in a<br>
patient. This method will now be described.<br>
First a signal from a pressure sensor 16 and transducer 2 representative of pressure<br>
in a body cavity is received and sampled at selected intervals. This signal is<br>
converted to digital form 7 and stored along with a time reference representative of<br>
the time at which the sample was made 9. The time reference does not have to be a<br>
time reference value stored for every sample. Since the sample rate will be known,<br>
it will be sufficient to store an actual time reference for the start of the measuring<br>
period. The time reference for the individual samples will then be given by their<br>
relative address in memory.<br>
The stored sample values may then be analyzed in order to generate a presentation<br>
regarding a time period of at least one of the following:<br>
- number of pressure elevations with any selected combination of level and<br>
duration,<br>
- number of pressure changes with any selected combination of level difference and<br>
duration of change,<br>
- number of single pulse pressure waves with pre-selected characteristics such as<br>
minimum, maximum, amplitude, latency and rise time.<br>
This type of analysis may be performed either on-line or off-line. During on-line<br>
analysis, analysis is performed repeatedly and presented repeatedly during real-<br>
time on-line monitoring. This allows for comparisons of pressure characteristics at<br>
repeated intervals. Off-line analysis is performed after the recording period has<br>
been ended.<br>
In order to analyze number of pressure elevations with any selected combination of<br>
level and duration occurring in a time period, the stored samples are simply<br>
analyzed in order to determine for how long the measured pressure has remained<br>
within a certain pressure interval. According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the user performing the analysis will be able to set the pressure intervals<br>
defining the various levels and duration of pressure elevations manually and<br>
perform the analysis repeatedly with different values for these parameters. Level<br>
may be measured on a linear scale e.g. with intervals of 5 mmHg, while the time<br>
scale intervals should preferably increase with time, e.g. each interval being twice<br>
as long as the previous shorter interval.<br>
An analysis of number of pressure changes with any selected combination of level<br>
difference and duration of change would involve an analysis of the stored samples<br>
in order to determine the size of a pressure change and the time over which the<br>
change takes place.<br>
An analysis of single pulse pressure waves will take into consideration not only<br>
elevations that remain within a certain time interval, but the transition of a wave<br>
from minimum to maximum and back to a new minimum or vice versa. Pre-<br>
selected characteristics identifying a pressure wave of interest may be the duration<br>
of the single pulse wave from minimum (maximum) back to minimum (maximum)<br>
combined either with minimum value, maximum value or amplitude of the single<br>
wave. Another pre-selected characteristic may be the rise time of the single wave.<br>
The pressure sensor 16 may be applied by implanting the sensor in a body cavity of<br>
the patient, but it may also be applied by a non-invasive technique with a sensor<br>
using acoustic measuring signals, ultrasonic or Doppler, or even a pressure sensor<br>
for measuring blood pressure. In general, a problem with non-invasive sensors<br>
recording intracranial pressure, is the lack of a zero level since intracranial<br>
pressure is calibrated against atmospheric pressure. The present invention solves<br>
this problem by computing the relative differences in pressure during single<br>
pressure wave analysis. Thereby the need for a zero level is excluded.<br>
The computer is not shown in detail. It preferably includes a standard<br>
communication interface for receiving a set of digital pressure sample values from<br>
the apparatus described above, as well as data memory, such as a hard drive, for<br>
storing the received sample values and processing means, such as a<br>
microprocessor, with access to said data memory, and capable of analyzing said<br>
sample values in order to determine at least one of the following: - number of<br>
pressure elevations with any selected combination of level and duration - number<br>
of pressure changes with any selected combination of level difference and duration<br>
of change, - number of single pulse pressure waves with preselected characteristics<br>
regarding minimum, maximum, amplitude, latency and rise time. The computer<br>
further includes a video interface in communication with said processing means<br>
and capable of, in combination with the processor means, generating a visual<br>
presentation of the result of any analysis performed on the pressure sample values<br>
together with a graphical user interface. The video interface may be a graphics card<br>
connected to a display for displaying the generated visual presentation. The<br>
computer will also include input means allowing a user of the system to enter and<br>
change parameters on which said analysis should be based. These input means will<br>
normally include a keyboard and e.g. a mouse, and the user will be assisted by a<br>
graphical user interface presented on the display.<br>
The parameters on which the analysis should be based may include at least some of<br>
the following: pressure intervals defining a number of pressure elevations, pressure<br>
change intervals defining a number of pressure change step sizes, time intervals<br>
defining a number of durations, pressure wave characteristics including minimum,<br>
maximum, amplitude and latency, selection of type of analysis, and selection of<br>
presentation of numbers as absolute numbers, percentages or numbers per time<br>
unit.<br>
The operation of the computer 6 will preferably be controlled by computer program<br>
instructions stored in the computer 6 and making the computer capable of<br>
performing the analysis. The program will preferably be able to perform the<br>
analysis based on default values in the absence of parameters input by a user. Such<br>
a computer program may be stored on a computer readable medium such as a<br>
magnetic disc, a CD ROM or some other storage means, or it may be available as a<br>
carrier signal transmitted over a computer network such as the Internet.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the graphical user interface of the computer software used for<br>
presenting the results of the sampling described above. The software processes the<br>
digital pressure signals. Before the continuous pressure recordings are presented in<br>
the graphical user interface as shown in FIG. 2, the pressure signals are sampled<br>
and averaged. With regard to FIG. 2, the sample update rate was in the range 30 to<br>
100 Hz and the update rate (average interval) was in the range 1 to 5 seconds. The<br>
update rates may vary between 1 - 10 Hz for low frequency sampling. Modern vital<br>
signs monitors may offer a computer interface producing this type of averaging.<br>
Various modules of the software generate output or can be invoked through this<br>
interface. The intracranial pressure curve 34 may be presented in various windows.<br>
The X-axis shows the time of registration 20, that is real time of intracranial<br>
pressure sampling (presented as hours: minutes: seconds). The Y-axis 21 shows the<br>
absolute intracranial pressure recordings (presented as mmHg). During the<br>
recordings, it is possible to mark events (e.g. sleep, walking, sitting) and these may<br>
be presented as symbols 22 along the X- axis above the pressure graph. There are<br>
functions 33 for selecting the recording periods, for instance selecting parts of the<br>
intracranial pressure curve during sleep, walking, sitting etc. There are functions<br>
for selecting different window sizes 23 both vertically and horizontally. The curve<br>
34 presented in the window in FIG. 2 represents about 21 hours recording time<br>
(that is actual recording time). A special function 24 allows simple statistical<br>
analysis of the data presented in the window (with calculations of mean, standard<br>
deviation, median, ranges and time of recording). Another function 25 transfers to<br>
a software module that performs quantitative analysis of a single intracranial<br>
pressure curve in accordance with the invention. The results of this analysis are<br>
described below with reference to FIG. 3-6. Another function 26 allows export of<br>
intracranial pressure data from a selected window to files with a selected text<br>
format such as ASCII, that can be utilized by e.g. spreadsheet or word processing<br>
applications. The intracranial pressure curve may be smoothened by another<br>
function 27. Another function allows printing of the intracranial pressure curve 28.<br>
The software also includes a function for patient identification 29 also containing<br>
some data of the patient (such as tentative diagnosis and cause of examination). In<br>
addition, there are start 31 and stop 32 buttons for controlling the sampling<br>
process. If the apparatus has collected pressure samples from several pressure<br>
transducers 2, e.g. intracranial and blood pressure, these may be simultaneously<br>
analyzed. The functions are linked up to the pressure recordings displayed in the<br>
window. Any type of pressure may be presented in this way.<br>
The size of the window, that is the observation time may be changed to reveal the<br>
single pulse waves. Each single pulse wave is built up from a blood pressure wave.<br>
Comparable to the heart rate, during one minute of recording often about 50-70<br>
single pulse waves may be recorded. There is, however, a large variation in heart<br>
rate both between and within individuals, accordingly there is a variation in the<br>
numbers of single pulse intracranial or blood pressure waves during one minute<br>
recording.<br>
The functions referred to above and the software modules that perform them will<br>
not be described in detail as they are well known in the art and do not constitute a<br>
part of the invention as such.<br>
Reference is now made to FIG. 3 which shows the graphical user interface of the<br>
software module for analysis of the intracranial or blood pressure curve, or other<br>
pressures in human body cavities. The selected window of the intracranial pressure<br>
curve 34 is presented as a chart or matrix 35 of quantities of different types,<br>
derived through the invented method of analysis. Any size of the recording period<br>
33 represented by the window may be selected for the quantitative analysis. A<br>
similar user interface is used independent on the type of pressure measured.<br>
The mathematical functions may be implemented in the software by various routes.<br>
One implementation is shortly described. The data needed for analysis of pressure<br>
elevations of different levels and durations include the pressure recordings and the<br>
corresponding time recordings. Two variables are selected, namely the threshold<br>
levels (pressures expressed in mmHg) and the width (time expressed in seconds).<br>
A search is made for both peaks (positive-going bumps) and valleys (negative-<br>
going bumps), and the exact levels of peaks and valleys are identified. Peaks with<br>
heights lower than the threshold or valleys with troughs higher than the thresholds<br>
are ignored. For a threshold value less or equal to zero a valley search is<br>
performed. For threshold values greater than zero a search for peaks is performed.<br>
The peak/valleys analysis is performed for every with/threshold combination in the<br>
matrix. In short, the procedure is as follows. The part of the pressure curve 34 that<br>
is to be examined is selected 33, the data is visualised in the user interface. A<br>
suitable width/threshold matrix is selected, specifying the with/threshold<br>
combinations. The units used are time in seconds (width) 37, and pressure in<br>
mmHg (threshold) 36, respectively. The software records the numbers of samples<br>
that fit a given width/threshold combination. The output from the analysis is a<br>
matrix containing the numbers of all the different width and threshold<br>
combinations. An example of such a matrix 35 is given in FIG. 3. As shown in the<br>
matrix 35, the width/threshold combination 20 seconds/25 mmHg (that is ICP<br>
elevations of 25 mmHg lasting 20 seconds) occurred 63.00 times during the actual<br>
recording time of 21.10 hours 45. In this matrix the numbers were not standardised<br>
to a selected recording period 42. The pressure elevations are relative to the zero<br>
level that corresponds to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
By clicking a first button 38, the user can select a presentation of the data as a chart<br>
of numbers of intracranial pressure elevations with various combinations of level<br>
36 and duration 37. The intracranial pressure levels and durations may be selected<br>
in each case. According to a preferred embodiment, intracranial pressure is<br>
expressed as mmHg and duration as seconds and minutes. Also blood pressure may<br>
be expressed as mmHg. Independent of the type of pressure measured the pressures<br>
may be presented in the same way.<br>
A second button 39 allows the user to select presentation of the data as a chart of<br>
numbers of intracranial pressure intracranial pressure changes of different levels 36<br>
and duration 37. The changes may be differences between two recordings or<br>
differences between a recording compared to a given or selected value (e.g. mean<br>
pressure).<br>
By clicking a third button 40, the user selects presentation of the data as numbers<br>
of single pulse pressure waves with pre-selected characteristics. The user accesses<br>
an input dialog box for entering these characteristics by clicking a fourth button 41.<br>
Each single pulse pressure wave is identified by minimum, maximum, amplitude,<br>
latency and rise time. Further details about analysis and presentation of the<br>
parameters of single pulse pressure waves are given in FIG's. 7-10.<br>
The presentation of the results of the analysis in chart 35 may be toggled between<br>
absolute numerical quantities and percentages of recording time by clicking one of<br>
two buttons 44.<br>
The numbers may be standardized by presenting the data as numbers per time unit<br>
42. The time unit (e.g.) may be selected in each individual case. The data presented<br>
in FIG. 3 was based on a recording time of 21.1 hrs (actual recording time 45), and<br>
the recordings were not standardized in this case (represented by zero in<br>
standardization input box 42). It should be noted that standardization may be<br>
performed to various time units, such as each one minute, one hour or even 10<br>
hours. Since the calculation of single pulse pressure waves automatically also gives<br>
the heart rate it is possible to standardize the numbers according to a given heart<br>
rate (further details given in FIG. 7). For example, the numbers may be<br>
standardized to a given heart rate of 60/min.<br>
During on-line presentation the matrix 35 may be compared repeatedly. The whole<br>
matrix 35 may not need to be presented but only certain width/threshold<br>
combinations. Differences between certain combinations at different time intervals<br>
may be revealed. For example, the numbers or percentages of intracranial pressures<br>
of 15, 20 and 25 mmHg lasting 5 minutes during 1 hour recording period may be<br>
computed and presented each hour during on-line presentation. Normalization of<br>
data to a standardized recording time 42 and heart rate allows for accurate<br>
comparisons between different time intervals for individual cases, as well as<br>
comparisons between individuals.<br>
Again, a special function 43 allows the analyzed data to be saved as text files with<br>
a selected text format such as ASCII, or other files compatible with applications for<br>
mathematical and/or statistical handling of the data or for generating presentations.<br>
FIG. 4 shows part of the graphical user interface of FIG. 3 with a different set of<br>
parameters. In particular, the various time intervals of duration 37 have been<br>
changed, and the matrix 35 shows numbers of elevations normalized as number of<br>
occurrences per time unit 42. In this case the numbers are derived from a<br>
standardized recording time of 10 hours 42, with the actual recording period 9.01<br>
hrs 45.<br>
The results shown in FIG. 3 are the results of an analysis of number of pressure<br>
elevations with selected combinations of level and duration. As indicated in FIG. 4,<br>
the stored samples have been analyzed in order to determine for how long the<br>
measured pressure level 36 has remained within a certain pressure interval,<br>
represented as -10, -5 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 mmHg relative to<br>
atmospheric pressure, for certain periods of time 37. The various periods of time<br>
37 are selected as 30, 60, 300, 600, 1200 and 2400 seconds, respectively. In FIG. 4,<br>
the results have been normalized to numbers during a 10 hours recording period 42.<br>
Among the results in the result matrix 35 it can be seen that intracranial pressure<br>
elevations of 45 mmHg with a duration of 30 seconds have occurred 8.88 times<br>
when normalized to a 10 hour measuring period. Similarly, pressure elevations of<br>
30 mmHg with a duration of 600 seconds have occurred 2.22 times when<br>
normalized to a 10 hrs recording period. In FIG. 3, where the results are not<br>
normalized, all the results are integers.<br>
During the standardisation procedure, the numbers or percentages are adjusted to a<br>
given factor. The normalised time may be chosen in each individual. An example is<br>
given. If the actual recording time is 6 hours, a standardisation to 10 hours<br>
recording time implies that all numbers or percentages of pressure elevations are<br>
multiplied with a factor equal to 10/6 (that is 1.66666).<br>
The following example is intended to illustrate various aspects of the present<br>
invention regarding related measurements of pressure waves described in FIG.'s 2-<br>
4, but is not intended to limit the scope thereof.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the same part of the graphical user interface as FIG. 4, but in this<br>
case the analysis is an analysis of number of pressure with selected combinations<br>
of level difference 30 and duration of change 37. The stored samples have been<br>
analyzed in order to determine the number of pressure changes of certain sizes 30,<br>
represented as -20, -15, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 mmHg relatively, and the<br>
duration 37 over which these changes take place, given as 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,<br>
40, 45 and 50 seconds. Among the results given in the result matrix 35 it can be<br>
seen that a pressure change of 2 mmHg that takes place over a 15 seconds has<br>
occurred on average 1.14 times per 10 hour period. Changes of 0 mmHg represent<br>
periods of time over which the pressure has remained constant. Also in this matrix<br>
the numbers have been standardized to numbers during a 10 hours recording<br>
period. The standardization procedure gives the opportunity to compare pressure<br>
curves, either within individuals at different time intervals or between individuals.<br>
The procedure of comparing pressure curves 34 is further illustrated in FIG. 6. The<br>
pressure curves before (left) and after (right) surgery are shown, and below the<br>
matrix 35 of numbers of pressure elevations. The numbers are standardized to a 10<br>
hrs recording period 42. This example is intended to illustrate various aspects of<br>
the invention described in FIGS. 2-6, but is not intended to limit the scope thereof.<br>
Continuous intracranial pressure monitoring was performed in a 3 years and 10<br>
months old boy due to suspected premature closure of the cranial sutures. The boy<br>
had symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. During sleep the data of the<br>
intracranial pressure curve were as follows: Mean intracranial pressure 15.4<br>
mmHg, range 0-57.1 mmHg, std 6.0 mmHg, and time of pressure recording 480<br>
min (8.0 hrs). On the basis of the results of intracranial pressure monitoring,<br>
surgery was performed. A cranial expansion procedure that is a rather major<br>
procedure was performed to increase the cranial volume and thereby reduce<br>
intracranial pressure. However, after surgery the patient still had symptoms of<br>
intracranial hypertension. Therefore it was decided to repeat the intracranial<br>
pressure monitoring, that was undertaken six months after surgery. The data for<br>
this monitoring during sleep were as follows: Mean intracranial pressure 15.2<br>
mmHg, range 5.5-39.4 mmHg, std 3.9 mmHg, and time of intracranial pressure<br>
recording 591 min (9.85 hrs). This new intracranial pressure monitoring Was<br>
inconclusive because mean intracranial pressure was unchanged after surgery. In<br>
retrospect, the monitoring of intracranial pressure was without purpose since no<br>
conclusions could be drawn on the basis of the pressure recordings. Though the<br>
pressure was unchanged after surgery, it was decided not to perform a new<br>
operation though the results of intracranial pressure monitoring did not document<br>
any reduction of intracranial pressure after cranial expansion surgery. A "wait and<br>
see" policy was chosen on the basis of intracranial pressure monitoring. However,<br>
when the method according to the present invention was applied retrospectively to<br>
the intracranial pressure curves before and after surgery, it was found a marked and<br>
significant reduction of number of intracranial pressure elevations. The matrix 35<br>
of numbers of intracranial pressure elevations of different levels 36 and duration's<br>
37 before and after surgery is presented in FIGS. 6a and 6b, respectively. In<br>
FIGS. 6a, 6b both the intracranial pressure curve and the corresponding matrix 35<br>
of intracranial pressure elevations of different levels 36 (20 - 45 mmHg) and<br>
durations 37 (0.5 - 40 minutes) are presented (before surgery at left and after<br>
surgery at right). The matrix 35 is presented as numbers during a standardised<br>
recording time of 10 hours 42 (actual recording time 45 before surgery 8 hours and<br>
after surgery 9.85 hours). The results documents that surgery had a major effect in<br>
reducing the number of intracranial pressure elevations despite an unchanged mean<br>
intracranial pressure. After surgery, there were no elevations of 40 or 45 mmHg,<br>
the number of elevations of 25, 30 or 35 ramHg were markedly and significantly<br>
reduced, whereas the number of intracranial pressure elevations of 20 mmHg were<br>
not significantly changed. For example, during a standardized recording time of 10<br>
hours, intracranial pressure elevations of 30 mmHg lasting 1 minute occurred 30<br>
times before surgery (left matrix) and one time after surgery (right matrix). Various<br>
statistical methods may be applied to the data to identify statistically significant<br>
changes. Accordingly application of this method would have justified no re-<br>
operation in a stronger and more reliable way. The patient has been followed for an<br>
observation period of 2 years without surgery and has shown a satisfactory<br>
development in this period.<br>
In FIGS. 2-6 changes in the pressure curves of longer duration (30 seconds or<br>
above) have been illustrated. Though reference has been made to intracranial<br>
pressure, this represents no limitation of the invention. Pressures from other body<br>
cavities may be presented in the same way.<br>
In the following FIGS. 7-10 the invention applied to single pulse pressure waves is<br>
described. Analysis of single pulse pressure waves represents an even more<br>
detailed strategy for comparing pressures between and within individuals.<br>
With regard to data collection, several steps are basically similar to the processes<br>
described for FIGS. 2-6. The signals from the sensor are converted to either a<br>
continuous current or voltage signal that is further processed in the apparatus 1 or<br>
modifications thereof. The continuous current or voltage signals are converted to<br>
digital signals within the analogue to digital converter. Another approach is to<br>
collect data from a vital signs monitor. Different from the data presented in FIGS.<br>
2 - 6 a higher sampling rate is required for analysis of single waves. With regard to<br>
single wave analysis the crucial point is to have a sufficient sample rate, as well as<br>
sufficient resolution order to reproduce the pressure waveform properly. According<br>
to the experience of the inventor so far a sampling rate of at least 100 Hz is<br>
sufficient to find maximum and minimum values an calculate latency, amplitude<br>
and rise time for the first peak (P1) (see FIG. 7). A higher sampling rate (at least<br>
200Hz) is required to compute the latencies and amplitudes of the second (P2) and<br>
third (P3) peaks. It is required that the analogue to digital converter has a<br>
resolution of at least 12 bits. It is preferably to use 16 bits or higher.<br>
Reference now is given to FIG. 7, demonstrating the parameters of a single pulse<br>
pressure wave that are analyzed quantitatively. All pressure signals are recorded,<br>
usually with a recording frequency of 100 Hz or above. The window with single<br>
pulse pressure waves (see FIG.7a) is opened by pressing button 40 (see FIG. 3).<br>
The single waves are defined by the maximum 46 and minimum 47 values. By<br>
pressing another button 41 (FIG. 3), the following parameters (see FIG. 7b) at any<br>
point on the single pressure curve may be computed: Amplitude 48, latency 49, and<br>
rise time 50.<br>
Latency 47 represents the time interval during which the pressure is changed from<br>
one pressure to another pressure. Each pressure signal may be identified on the<br>
time scale because pressures are recorded along with a time reference. The<br>
maximum 46 and minimum values 47 identify each single wave. The latency from<br>
one minimum 47 value back to another minimum 47 value is the heart rate and the<br>
duration of the wave. The latency from minimum 47 to maximum 46 is the time<br>
where the pressure of the single wave increases from the diastolic to the systolic<br>
pressure.<br>
People skilled in the art would know that a single intracranial pressure wave<br>
contains three peaks, the first (P1), second (P2) and third (P3). The second peak<br>
(P2) also is termed the tidal wave and the third peak (P3) the dichrotic wave.<br>
Whether the waveform is reproduced properly or not depends on a sufficient<br>
resolution order and a sufficient sampling rate. The expressions amplitude 48,<br>
latency 49 and rise time 50 are with reference to each of these peaks. The<br>
identification of the first peak (P1) is relative to maximum 46 and minimum 47.<br>
The identification of the second peak (P2) also is relative to the first peak (P1),<br>
and the third peak (P3) is relative to the second peak (P2). In the present<br>
embodiment focus is given to amplitude, latency and rise time related to the first<br>
peak (P1), though this does not represent any limitation of the scope of the<br>
invention. References may also be to the second (P2) and third peaks (P3).<br>
For the first peak (P1), the amplitude ?PI represents the relative pressure<br>
difference between the diastolic minimum 47 and systolic maximum 46 pressures.<br>
Latency ?TI is the time interval by which pressures increase from diastolic<br>
minimum 47 to systolic maximum 46. Rise time ?PI /?TI is the quotient between<br>
difference in pressure divided by difference in time. The differences of pressures<br>
and time represent relative values. Any type of relationship may be calculated. The<br>
software allows the calculation of a matrix 53 of number of single pulse pressure<br>
waves (see FIG. 7c) with pre-selected wave characteristics of different amplitude<br>
51 and latency 52. Any kind of combinations of single wave parameters may be<br>
computed within the matrix 53. The amplitudes 51 usually are expressed in mmHg<br>
and the durations 52 in seconds.<br>
The results may be presented as absolute numbers or as percentages, and the<br>
results may be standardized to a selected recording time (for example each one<br>
minute, one hour, or even 10 hours recording time) 42, as compared to the actual<br>
recording period 45. During the standardisation procedure, the numbers or<br>
percentages of single waves with selected parameters are adjusted to a factor. The<br>
normalised time may be chosen in each individual. An example is given. If the<br>
actual recording time is 6 hours, and it is desired to standardise to 5 minutes<br>
recording time, the function implies that all numbers of single waves are divided<br>
with a factor equal to (6 x 60)/5 (that is 72.0). (See FIG. 7d)<br>
Calculation of single pulse pressure waves automatically gives the heart rate<br>
because each intracranial single pulse pressure wave is built up from the blood<br>
pressure wave. Therefore the numbers of single waves with certain characteristics<br>
during a given recording time also may be standardized to a given heart rate 55, as<br>
compared to the actual heart rate 54. During the procedure of standardisation to a<br>
given heart rate, the heart rate must be selected beforehand. The recording interval<br>
also has to be selected, when an average of the heart rate must be computed. An<br>
example is given, though this is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It<br>
is chosen to standardise the numbers or percentages of certain single waves to a<br>
heart rate of 60 beats a minute. Furthermore, it is chosen to average the heart rate<br>
to each 5-second recording period. During this recording period of 5 seconds the<br>
averaged heart rate is computed. Given that the total continuous recording period is<br>
6 hours this standardisation analysis has to be repeated a total of 4320 times<br>
(xl2/minute, x720/hour). Given that the actual average heart rate is 120 beats a<br>
second in a 5 seconds interval, the numbers or percentages of single waves during<br>
the period of 5 seconds must be divided by 2, to be standardised to a average heart<br>
rate of 60 beats a second. On the other hand, if the average heart rate is 30 during<br>
the 5 seconds interval the numbers or percentages of single waves during these 5<br>
seconds has to be multiplied with a factor of 2, to be standardised to a heart rate of<br>
60 beats a second. This approach also allows for on-line and real-time update of<br>
standardised numbers or percentages to a given heart rate since such an update may<br>
be performed repeatedly every 5 seconds.<br>
With regard to presentation of single wave parameters, a number of variations are<br>
possible. The matrix 53 of pre-selected characteristics of amplitude 51 and latency<br>
52, may be presented repeatedly and comparisons between matrixes 53 at different<br>
times may be performed. Only certain single wave parameters may be compared.<br>
The numbers/percentages of single wave parameters may be subject to any type of<br>
statistical analysis.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the computation of single pulse pressure waves with certain pre-<br>
selected characteristics. The mathematical process of quantitative analysis of single<br>
wave parameters may be implemented in the software in various ways, one strategy<br>
of implementation is described here. The acquired signal is first run through<br>
separate detection of minimum 47 and maximum 46 values. The maximum<br>
threshold value is set to the lowest level in the signal, and width greater than pre-<br>
selected seconds. A variety such pre-selected seconds may be chosen, and the<br>
values may depend on age. In the first studies, durations of 0.1-0.2 seconds were<br>
used, but other durations may also be used. The minimum threshold is set to<br>
highest signal level, and the width is set to pre-selected seconds, as described<br>
above. After this analysis all maximums 46 and minimums 47 are represented with<br>
an amplitude value and a location value or time stamp. The locations are reported<br>
in indices from the start of processing. This procedure will result in a lot artificial<br>
maximum and minimum detections. In other words the maximum 46 and minimum<br>
47 detection has to be refined. After this is done the result is a collection of<br>
approved maximum and minimum pairs, which in the next turn can be presented to<br>
the function handling the dynamic parameter analysis. First, grouping of the<br>
maximum values and minimum values is performed. For every maximum 46 the<br>
subsequent minimum 47 is found. This couple makes a maximum-minimum pair.<br>
The latter maximum-minimum pair is inspected for threshold level. The threshold<br>
value has to be larger than a given value. This is performed by subtracting the<br>
maximum amplitude and minimum amplitude. If this value is less than the<br>
threshold value the pair is discarded. Afterwards the pair is inspected for the rise<br>
time (?PI/?TI). The rise time is expressed as maximum amplitude minus<br>
minimum amplitude divided by maximum location minus minimum location. This<br>
will remove pairs caused by for example an artefact in the collected signal. All rise<br>
time values with a value equal or larger than a given value is discarded. A large<br>
variation is possible with regard to rise times that are discarded. The collection of<br>
maximums and minimum's contained now only approved values. All the dynamic<br>
values are calculated by using the approved maximum-minimum pairs. The values<br>
which are calculated are amplitude (?PI) (delta intracranial pressure expressed in<br>
mmHg) 51, latency (?TI) 52, and rise time (?PI/?TI) 59, and heart rate 58. All<br>
these values are quite forward to find using the information found in the approved<br>
maximum-minimum pairs. The collections of amplitude (?PI) 51 values give<br>
information constituting the matrix column information. The collections of latency<br>
(?TI) values 52 give the matrix row information. A matrix 53 of different<br>
amplitude 51 and latency 52 combinations is computed.<br>
An important aspect with the computation parameters of single pulse pressure<br>
waves is that the invention computes the relative differences in pressures and time.<br>
These relative differences are not related to a zero level of pressure. Accordingly,<br>
the single wave analysis is not influenced by the zero level of pressure, neither of<br>
drift of the zero level of the sensor. It should be noted that the procedure of<br>
calculating pressure elevations of various durations FIGS. 3-6 involves<br>
computation of absolute intracranial pressures (or other pressures in a human body<br>
cavity) relative to atmospheric pressure. The conventional methods of assessing<br>
intracranial pressure use calibration against atmospheric pressure. The present<br>
invention of computation of relative pressures of single pressure waves solves<br>
several problems of known in the art.<br>
(a) The impact of inter-individual and intra-individual differences in pressure is<br>
reduced. When comparing continuous pressure curves between or within<br>
individuals, a source of error may be differences in the baseline pressure due to<br>
differences or drift of zero level. In the present invention, the accurate zero<br>
level does not affect the single wave parameters computed.<br>
(b) A drift in the zero level of the pressure sensor usually is a problem with<br>
pressure sensors, particularly when pressure is monitored continuously for<br>
several days. Drift in zero level of pressure has no influence on the single wave<br>
parameters computed as described here.<br>
(c) The major problem with continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure by<br>
means of non-invasive sensors is the problem of determining a zero level.<br>
Thereby relative differences in pressure must be computed, but the output give<br>
non-accurate data since it may be nearly impossible to suggest the intracranal<br>
pressure on the basis of such relative pressure assessments. In the present<br>
invention it has been possible to accurately compute the single waves with pre-<br>
selected characteristics of latency, amplitude and rise time. Since relative<br>
differences are computed, there is no need for a zero level. When single waves<br>
are computed by means of a non-invasive sensor, the present invention allows<br>
for determination of the intracranial pressures with a high degree of accuracy.<br>
On the basis of computing several hundred thousand of single waves and<br>
comparing the single wave parameters with the mean intracranial pressure, a<br>
high degree of correlation between amplitude, rise time and mean intracranial<br>
pressure has been found. According to this invention, single wave analysis of<br>
signals from non-invasive sensors may both give information about relative<br>
changes in pressure and about the intracranial pressure, as the relationships<br>
between intracranial pressure and single wave characteristics are known<br>
beforehand, on the basis of a large number of comparisons. This process may be<br>
as follows. A non-invasive sensor 16 may be applied to the patient and<br>
connected to the transducer 2, and the signals are processed in the apparatus 1<br>
or modifications thereof. Such sensors 16 may use acoustic or other signals, for<br>
example by application of a sensor-device to the outer ear, sensing pressure in<br>
the middle ear indicative of the intracranial pressure. The signals are converted<br>
in the apparatus 1 and stored along with the time stamp. The computer software<br>
handles the digital signals and performs the quantitative analysis of the<br>
parameters of single pulse pressure waves described here. Without knowing the<br>
exact zero level of intracranial pressures, changes of single wave parameters<br>
may be followed continuously. This approach provides a simple approach to<br>
follow changes in intracranial pressure, and obtaining accurate information<br>
about the intracranial pressure.<br>
(d) It is possible to implant permanently pressure sensors within the intracranial<br>
compartment, for example in conjunction with ventricular shunts. Telemetric<br>
devices may record pressures. Also with this type of pressure monitoring, drift of<br>
zero level remains a problem, hence it may be a question of whether the correct<br>
pressure is monitored. The present invention soles this problem as drift in zero<br>
level does not affect the pressures recorded.<br>
Exploration of the single pulse pressure waves is started by pressing the button 40,<br>
and the single wave parameters are selected by pressing the button 41. FIG. 8a<br>
shows the single pulse pressure waves 57, including the time recordings 20 along<br>
the X axis, and pressure levels 56 along Y axis. On the Y axis the absolute pressure<br>
values are shown, it should be noted, however, that the single pulse pressure waves<br>
are calculated by computation of relative pressure and time differences. As<br>
indicated on FIG,.8b, the single waves are identified by the minimum 47 and<br>
maximum 46 values. For the first peak (P1), the amplitude (?PI) and latency<br>
(?TI) are both indicated.<br>
In FIG. 8c is also indicated the process of computing numbers of characteristics of<br>
single pulse pressure waves. A graphical user interface reveals the curve of<br>
intracranial pressure 34. A window revealing the pressure curve 34 along with the<br>
absolute intracranial pressure recordings 21 and the time of registration 20 is<br>
shown. The actual recording period 45 was 472.0 seconds, and the recording period<br>
was not standardised 42 (0.00 in output box). During this period of recording the<br>
numbers of single pulse pressure waves with pre-selected characteristics where<br>
computed. The amplitudes of single waves 51 were selected to either 2.0, 2.5, 3.0,<br>
3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 or 7.0 mmHg. The latencies of the single waves 52<br>
were either selected to 0.23, 0.25, 0.26, 0.27, or 0.28 seconds. The numbers of<br>
single pulse pressure waves with these pre-selected characteristics were computed<br>
and presented in the matrix 53. For example, during the recording period of 472.0<br>
seconds, single pulse pressure waves with an amplitude of 5.5 mmHg and a latency<br>
0.28 seconds (that is rise time of 5.5/0.28 = 19.64 mmHg/sec) occurred 43 times<br>
during this recording period. The results may be standardized 42 to a recording<br>
time of for example 600 seconds. In this situation all numbers must be multiplied<br>
with a factor of 600/472. The numbers also may be standardised to a selected heart<br>
rate, as described above. A number of variations are possible with regard to<br>
methods of data presentation.<br>
The invention provides the option for comparisons of pressure curves. For<br>
example, during monitoring of intracranial pressure during sleep the numbers of<br>
single waves with certain pre-selected characteristics may be computed (for<br>
example amplitude 4 to 8 mmHg and latency 0.25-0.28 seconds). The numbers of<br>
such single waves may be computed during a standardized recording period (e.g.<br>
each one minute or each one hour) and a standardized heart rate (e.g. 70/min). The<br>
numbers of single waves may be computed within the same individual at different<br>
times (e.g. before and after treatment) and compared. Alternatively the numbers of<br>
single waves may be computed within an individual and the numbers may be<br>
compared against a normal material.<br>
FIG. 9a demonstrates the recordings of intracranial pressure (cerebrospinal fluid<br>
which represent one of the compartments of the intracranial cavity) 34 while<br>
infusing a liquid into the cerebrospinal space. Pressures are presented as absolute<br>
values of mmHg on the Y axis 21 and time is expressed as seconds on the X axis<br>
20. The intracranial pressure 34 is measured simultaneously with infusion of<br>
physiological saline into the lumbar cerebrospinal space, which is termed infusion<br>
test. It is shown how the intracranial pressure curve 34 increases as liquid is<br>
infused. The increase of pressure is shown in the upper figure. FIG. 9b also<br>
demonstrates the simultaneous computation of rise time 59-60 and heart rate 58.<br>
With regard to rise time, two parameters are computed simultaneously, namely<br>
?PI/?TI 59 and ?P1/?T2 60. It is shown that the rise times ?PI/?TI 59 and<br>
AP1/AT2 60 increase with time. The heart rate 53, on the other hand, declines as<br>
the pressure increases. This illustrates that the rise times may be calculated<br>
repeatedly and plotted against time (X-axis). Alarm functions may be incorporated<br>
for example alarming the occurrence of ?PI/?TI 59 above a given level. Rise time<br>
may be an important predictor of abnormal pressure. The present technical solution<br>
allows for computation of the exact numbers or percentages of single waves with<br>
certain rise times during a given recording time. For example, the numbers or<br>
percentages of single waves with a rise time between for example 10 and 30<br>
mmHg/seconds during 5 minutes of recording may be computed repeatedly, and<br>
presented graphically. FIG. 9a, 9b show some examples of presentation of single<br>
wave characteristics, though the examples represent no limitation of the scope<br>
It should be noted in FIG. 9b that heart rate declines as the rise time increases. This<br>
is a physiological effect in the way that heart rate declines as a result of increased<br>
decompensation related to increased pressure. Since the relative duration of each<br>
single wave corresponds to the heart rate, the heart rate may be automatically<br>
computed. The observation presented in FIG. 9b further illustrates the value of<br>
concomitant recording of heart rate. The parameter heart rate provides additional<br>
information about abnormality of intracranial pressure.<br>
FIG. 10 shows strategies to compare pressure curves. The input box 40 (FIG. 3)<br>
allows for comparisons of various single pulse pressure waves. In particular single<br>
pulse pressure waves of intracranial pressure and blood pressure may be compared,<br>
but any type of presure may be compared. The different pressure waves are<br>
revealed simultaneously during real time on-line monitoring, with the identical<br>
time reference. The output may be time on the X axis 20 and pressure 21 on the Y<br>
axis. For example, the curve of single arterial blood pressure waves 61 may be<br>
revealed simultaneously with the single intracranial pulse pressure waves 57, see<br>
FIG. 10a. For a given recording period 45 the numbers of single pulse pressure<br>
waves may be computed and the numbers may be standardised to a given recording<br>
period 42. Furthermore the actual heart rate 54 may be standardised to a<br>
standardised heart rate 55. (See Fig. 10d). The curves of single pulse intracranial<br>
57 and arterial blood pressure 61 waves are presented in the upper figure to the<br>
right. The time reference 20 is identical, thus allowing comparisons of single pulse<br>
pressure waves at identical points of time. The Y axis reveals the absolute blood<br>
pressure 62 and intracranial pressure 56 values. Reference is here directed to FIG.<br>
10b. As described for intracranial pressure, a matrix may be computed with the<br>
opportunity to define relationships between parameters of different single waves.<br>
In the lower figure to the left is shown a matrix 65 (FIG. 10c) defining numbers of<br>
relationships between rise time for intracranial pressure waves (?P1-1/?T1-l) and<br>
rise time of blood pressure waves (?P1-2/?T1-2). This relationship (?P1-1/AT1-1)/<br>
(?P1-2/?T1-2) has been computed and the matrix 65 presents the numbers by which<br>
this relationship was 1,2, 3, or 4. This example represents no limitation concerning<br>
the relationships between single waves that may be computed.-<br>
The computer software may be integrated in the portable apparatus 1, as well as in<br>
a network station, a personal computer, medical device computers 6, computer<br>
servers 6 connected to vital signs monitors, or incorporated directly in vital signs<br>
monitors. Output from the quantitative analyzes may be presented on the monitor<br>
screen, flat screen or other devices known in the art.<br>
Various modifications of the apparatus 1 are possible. Components of the apparatus<br>
1 may be integrated in the pressure transducer 2 or in various types of computers<br>
including medical device computers 6.<br>
Though focus is given to intracranial pressure (including cerebrospinal fluid<br>
pressure), blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure, any type of pressure in a<br>
human body cavity may be assessed according to the invention described here.<br>
In all cases the invention described here may be used in (a) on-line monitoring of<br>
pressures revealing real-time changes in pressure characteristics, and (b)<br>
assessment of pressure curves after the end of pressure monitoring, that is off-line.<br>
In the assessment of normal pressure hydrocephalus, infusion tests also have been<br>
shown to be of value. During infusion tests pressure is measured within the<br>
cerebrospinal fluid space, either in the lumbar spinal cord or within the cerebral<br>
ventricles. The change in pressure also may be measured simultaneously with<br>
infusion of a liquid such as physiological saline. The present invention allows for<br>
calculation of single waves during the infusion test. The applicant has shown that<br>
changes in the infusion test are most accurately revealed by calculation of single<br>
wave parameters.<br>
When pressures are measured in the cerebrospinal fluid during so-called infusion<br>
testing, a catheter is applied to the cerebrospinal fluid space, usually either within<br>
the cerebral ventricles or to the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid space. The catheter is<br>
connected to a commercially available sensor for sensing pressures within a liquid.<br>
This pressure sensor 16 may be connected via the apparatus 1 described here to a<br>
commercially available computer, or via a vital signs monitor to the computer. In<br>
this situation the apparatus 1 is modified, thus serving as an interface between the<br>
sensor and the computer. Pressure recordings are made while a fluid is infused to<br>
the cerebrospinal fluid space. The applicant has shown that recordings of single<br>
pulse pressure waves may be done simultaneously as the fluid is infused.<br>
According to this intervention the various parameters of the single pulse pressure<br>
waves may be calculated as well as the heart rate variability during infusion of<br>
liquid. Various strategies of assessing single pulse pressure waves may be<br>
performed in this situation. The distribution of single waves during one minute of<br>
recording may be computed and related to the volume change that is known in this<br>
situation. The invention allows for standardisation of numbers or percentages to a<br>
given heart rate and a given recording period. For example, the matrix 53 of single<br>
waves with various amplitudes 51 and latencies 52 may be computed repeatedly<br>
during one minute of recording. Since the infusion rate and hence volume change is<br>
known a curve for each individual may be computed with percentage of pre-<br>
selected single wave on Y axis and volume change on X axis. When the curves of<br>
many individuals are known it is also possible to superimpose the recordings from<br>
one individual against a reference curve from several individuals. It has previously<br>
not been possible to superimpose the intracranial pressure recordings of a single<br>
subject on the pressure volume or elastance curve. The present invention may<br>
provide a technical solution for this problem. Since any types of single pulse wave<br>
parameters may be calculated by this invention, a variety of approaches may be<br>
possible.<br>
With regard to on-line presentations, pressures (for example intracranial and blood<br>
pressures) may be presented by conventional means as real-time presentation of<br>
numerical values of mean pressure or as real-time presentations of intracranial<br>
pressure curves. The present invention provides a technical solution for continuous<br>
analysis and presentation of parameters of single pulse pressure waves. For<br>
example, the numbers or percentages of a certain rise times (for example 10-20<br>
mmHg/sec) during a given recording period (e.g. 1 minutes) may be computed<br>
repeatedly and presented on a graph. Thereby changes in pressures may be detected<br>
before the conventional methods, thus providing early detection/warning of<br>
deterioration of pressures.<br>
Pressure may be monitored in both humans and animals. In particular, the<br>
invention may be used in animal experiments in which blood pressure medications<br>
are assessed.<br>
This invention represents a new technical solution in various aspects, which now<br>
will be commented on:<br>
(a) The invention provides a technical solution for digital recording of pressures in<br>
individuals that are free to move about.<br>
(b) The present apparatus allows for digital storing of a large number of<br>
intracranial and blood pressure recordings, different from the currently available<br>
apparatuses.<br>
(c) The standardisation procedure described here makes it possible to compare<br>
curves of different individuals, though the recording time for each individual may<br>
be different. Without this standardisation procedure, an alternative strategy might<br>
be to select pressure curves of identical duration from different individuals. Then it<br>
would be required to select one part of the curve, however, then it might be<br>
difficult to select a representative part of the curve. For example, if intracranial<br>
pressure or blood pressure is recorded continuously in one individual twice (one<br>
recording of 7 hours and one recording of 9 hours) and the two recordings are<br>
going to be compared, the problem is to compare representative portions of the<br>
curves. The present invention provides a technical solution to this problem by<br>
means of standardising the recordings to a given recording period. Thereby the<br>
whole recording period may be utilised in the assessment.<br>
(d) Though a major use with the present invention is off-line assessment of<br>
pressure recordings, the invention may as well be used for on-line and real-time<br>
monitoring of single pulse pressure waves (blood pressure, intracranial pressure,<br>
cerebral perfusion pressure, or other pressures in a human body cavity). The<br>
invention provides a technical solution for continuous calculation and presentation<br>
of single pulse pressure characteristics. Calculation of the accurate numbers or<br>
percentages of single pulse pressure parameters and comparisons of these<br>
parameters at different times, provide a technical solution for early<br>
detection/warning of changes in pressure. An example is given. The present<br>
invention allows for calculation of the exact numbers or percentages of single pulse<br>
pressure waves with amplitude 6 mmHg and latency 0.23 seconds (rise time 26<br>
mmHg/sec) during one minute or 5 minute recordings. Given that the presence of<br>
60% of such waves during a given recording period represents abnormality, it<br>
would be informative for the physician to have a graphical presentation of repeated<br>
computations of the percentage of this single pulse pressure wave. In fact, the<br>
invention allows for repeated computations of any combinations of single pulse<br>
wave parameters. A continuous and real time computation of the numbers or<br>
percentages of certain rise times (for example 26 mmHg/sec) during a given<br>
recording period represents an alternative presentation. Accordingly, this invention<br>
provides a technical solution for early warning of deterioration of pressures.<br>
(e) The quantitative algorithms and methods of assessing pressures have previously<br>
not been described. Several authors have used methods to explore the frequency<br>
distribution of pressure waves. In particular spectral analysis or Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation (or spectral analysis) has been used. These methods are<br>
fundamentally different from the methods described here. The methods previously<br>
used have not gained ground in the clinic and have not been useful in daily clinical<br>
practice.<br>
(f) The invention provides a technical solution for monitoring intracranial pressure<br>
without the problem of zero drift of pressure sensors or the problem of identifying<br>
the zero level.<br>
(g) The present invention provides a technical solution for comparisons of pressure<br>
curves within a body cavity, that is comparisons of waves in a wide sense of the<br>
word. Examples are comparisons of continuous pressure recordings within a single<br>
subject at different times, such as comparisons during a continuous monitoring of<br>
pressures. Alternatively continuous pressure recordings may be compared at<br>
different times, such as before and after treatment. Pressure curves may be<br>
compared between individuals or continuous pressure curves from an individual<br>
may be compared against a reference material. For example, continuous<br>
intracranial pressure is monitored for 12 hours in a single subject. The numbers of<br>
single pulse pressure waves with pre-selected characteristics concerning latency<br>
and rise time are computed. Since selection of only one portion of the curve would<br>
reduce the accuracy of the recordings, the numbers or percentages of the whole<br>
recording period may be standardised to a selected recording period. For example,<br>
the numbers or percentages of single waves with certain amplitudes and latencies<br>
during the actual recording period of 12 hours may be standardised to numbers of<br>
waves during one hour of recordings. This approach takes away the inaccuracy of<br>
selecting only one portion of the curve. In addition to computing the quantitative<br>
characteristics of high frequency fluctuations in pressure, quantitative analysis of<br>
the low frequency fluctuations in pressure may be computed, providing a more<br>
complete picture of the pressures. For low frequency pressure changes the normal<br>
distribution of pressure elevations of 20 mmHg lasting 10 minutes during for<br>
example one hour of recording may be computed. Due to some individual variation<br>
in the normal distribution exact values may not be computed but rather a<br>
distribution with the median and percentile distribution.<br>
(h) The invention provides a new technical solution for the clinical application of<br>
single wave analysis, when assessing continuous pressure recordings. Single pulse<br>
pressure wave parameters are calculated quantitatively, and the numbers or<br>
percentages of certain single waves may be computed. The numbers/percentages<br>
may be computed during a given recording period. Thereby the invention provides<br>
the unique opportunity to predict the placement of a continuous pressure recording<br>
in one individual on the elastance or pressure-volume curve. It has previously not<br>
been possible to superimpose the pressure recordings of an individual on the<br>
pressure-volume (elastance) curve because this curve is different for different<br>
individuals and the curve may vary over time. The effect of this inter- and intra-<br>
individual variation is markedly reduced by the present intervention. The present<br>
intervention provides a tool for computing a diagram of the normal variation of the<br>
pressure volume curve. For example the exponential pressure volume curve<br>
originally described by Langfitt in 1966 (volume on the X axis and pressure on the<br>
Y axis) may be presented as medians with percentiles. The present invention<br>
provides a tool for computing the distribution of certain single pulse pressure<br>
waves that may be considered as abnormal. For example, given that it is found that<br>
the presence of a single wave with amplitude 6 mmHg and latency 0.23 seconds in<br>
60% of the recording time is abnormal, the invention provides the option to<br>
compute in a single patient the numbers and frequency of such single waves.<br>
During infusion testing pressure changes are known along with changes in volume<br>
because the rate of volume change is known. This situation provides the<br>
opportunity to compute the distribution of the different waves at different levels of<br>
the curve. For example, the distribution of a single wave with a rise time 30<br>
mmHg/seconds may be computed at different pressures and volumes. During a<br>
recording time of 5 minutes these single waves may constitute 20% of single waves<br>
at one point of the horizontal part of the curve but may constitute 80% of single<br>
waves at one point of the vertical portion of the curve. Similar computations may<br>
be made for other single waves. Based on the recordings of many patients,<br>
normograms may a computed. Thereby the results from this single subject may be<br>
superimposed on the normogram of the pressure volume curve and an accurate<br>
description of elastance in this particular subject is given.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been described herein,<br>
it is to be understood that various changes, modifications, additions and<br>
adaptations are within the scope of the present invention, as set forth in the<br>
