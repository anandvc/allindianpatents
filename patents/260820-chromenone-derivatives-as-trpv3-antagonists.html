THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
CHROMENONE DERIVATIVES AS TRPV3 ANTAGONISTS<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of Indian Provisional Applications 2420/MUM/2008, filed on Nov 17, 2008; 664/MUM/2009, filed on Mar 23, 2009; and U.S. Provisional Applications 61/138,456, filed on Dec 17, 2008; 61/171,265, filed on Apr 21. 2009; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Technical Field The present patent application relates to chromenone derivatives as TRPV3 antagonists.<br>
Background<br>
Movement of ions across cellular membranes is carried out by specialized proteins. TRP channels are one large family of non-selective cation channels that function to help regulate ion flux and membrane potential. TRP channels are subdivided into 6 sub-families including the TRPV family. TRPV3 is a member of the TRPV class of TRP channels.<br>
TRPV3 is a calcium permeable nonselective cation channel. In addition to calcium ions, TRPV3 channels are permeable to other cations, for example sodium. Thus, TRPV3 channels modulate membrane potential by modulating the flux of cations such as calcium and sodium ions. TRPV3 receptors are mechanistically distinct from voltage-gated calcium channels. Generally, voltage-gated calcium channels respond to membrane depolarization and open to permit an influx of calcium from the extracellular medium that result in an increase in intracellular calcium levels or concentrations. In contrast, TRP channels which are non-selective, long lasting, produce more prolonged changes in ion concentration and are ligand gated (modulated by chemicals such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate [2-APB], vanilloids and heat). These mechanistic differences are accompanied by structural differences among voltage-gated and TRP channels. Thus, although many diverse channels act to regulate ion flux and membrane potential in various cell types and in response to numerous stimuli, it is important to recognize the significant structural, functional, and mechanistic differences among different classes of ion channels.<br><br>
TRPV3 proteins are thermosensitive channels expressed in skin cells (Peier et al. Science (2002), 296, 2046-2049) and dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord and brain (Xu et al Nature (2002), 418, 181-185; Smith et al. Nature (2002), 418. 186-188). In a keratinocyte cell line, stimulation of TRPV3 leads to release of inflammatory mediators including Interleukin-1. Thus TRPV3 may also play an important role in regulating inflammation and pain that results from the release of inflammatory stimuli. Particular TRPV3 proteins that may be used in screening assays, as described herein, to identify compounds that modulate a function of TRPV3 include, but are not limited to human TRPV3, mouse TRPV3, rat TRPV3 and Drosophila TRPV3. US2004/0009537 (the '537 application) disclosed sequences corresponding to human, mouse, and Drosophila TRPV3. For example, SEQ ID Nos 106 and 107 of the '537 application correspond to the human nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, respectively. SEQ ID Nos 108 and 109 of the '537 application correspond to the mouse nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, respectively.<br>
TRPV3 function has been basically implicated in the reception and transduction of pain. Accordingly, it would be desirable to identify and make compounds that can modulate one or more functions of TRPV3.<br>
WO 2007/056124, WO 2008/140750 and WO 2008/033564 disclose TRPV3 modulators, in particular antagonists, for treatment of various diseases mediated TRPV3.<br>
In efforts to discover better analgesics, there still exists a need for therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPV3.<br>

2-Hydroxyacetophenone of the general formula (1) is either commercially available or can be prepared by the procedures as described in Buell, B. G. el al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949, T\_ (1), 1901-1905; Bergmann, R. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 492-504. The cinnamic acid derivative of formula (2) is commercially available or can be prepared using known approaches (Bergdahl, M. ■/. Org. Chem., 2007, 72, 5244-5259). Approaches for the synthesis of 4-chromenones (5) are reported in: Helquist. P. Synthesis. 2006. 3654-3660; Silva. A. M. S. et al. J. Net. Chem. 1998, 35, 217-224. AM the aryl boronic acids of the formula (7) used in the coupling reactions were purchased from commercial sources.<br>
A general approach for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (I) wherein R1. R2, R3, 'nv and 'n' are as defined above, is described in Scheme 1. 2-Hydroxy acetophenone of the general formula (1) is coupled with cinnamic acid of the formula (2) to give the cinnamic ester (3) under acid catalysis. The rearrangement of ester of general formula (3) to diene alcohol of the formula (4) is carried out using a suitable base such as sodium hydride or potassium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at reflux temperature. Cyclization of compound of a general formula (4) using an acid catalyst (e.g. /?-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) in the presence of suitable solvent (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide) affords (E)-2-styrylchromones of a general formula (5). Further, halogenation of (E)-2-styrylchromones of general formula (5) with suitable reagent (e.g. N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). AModosccinimide (NIS), iodine/cerric ammonium nitrate) gives corresponding halo compound of general formula (6) (wherein<br><br>
X is halogen). Halo compound (6) is coupled with a suitable boronic acid of formula (7) wherein R2 is preferably aryl. under Suzuki reaction conditions (catalytic Pd(O) in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate or cesium carbonate) gives compounds represented by the general formula (I).<br><br>
An alternative approach for the synthesis of compounds of formula (1) wherein R1, R2; R3, 'm' and 'n' are as defined above, is described in Scheme 2. 2-Hydroxyacetophenone of general formula (1) can be converted into 2-methylchromenone of general formula (8) by a method known in the literature (Brion J. D. el a/. J. Het. Chem. 1991. 28. 2013-2019). Condensation of 2-methylchromones of general formula (8) with an aldehyde of a formula (9) in the presence of suitable base (example sodium hydride, sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide) and suitable solvent (example letrahydrofuran, ethanol, methanol) gives (E)-2-styrylchromones of general formula (5). Further, halogenation of (E)-2-styrylchromones of general formula (5) with suitable halogenating agent as described in Scheme 1 gives intermediates of the general formula (6) (wherein X is halogen). Halo compound (6) is coupled with a suitable boronic acid of formula (7) wherein R is preferably aryl, under Suzuki reaction conditions (catalytic Pd(O) in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate or cesium carbonate) gives compounds represented by the general formula (I).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
Specific compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (II), wherein Ra is cyclopentyl; R1, Rb, RC, 'm' and 'q' are as defined above, are prepared as shown in Scheme 3. Esterification of cinnamic acid (10) with phenolic ketone of the general formula (1) followed by rearrangement of ester intermediate (11) using a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent (e,g. tetrahydrofuran) at reflux temperature affords intermediate of the general formula (12). Cyclization of intermediate of a general formula (12) using an appropriate acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide followed by halogenation of the styrylchromenone. thus formed, gives compounds of the formula (13) (wherein X is halogen). Intermediate (13) where X is preferably bromine or iodine, is coupled with a suitable aryl boronic acid of general formula (14) in the presence of a suitable Pd(O) catalyst (example Pd(PPh3)4) in the presence of a suitable base (example sodium carbonate) in an appropriate solvent gives compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (II).<br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br>
(II)      (Raiscyclopenlyl)<br>
One more approach for the synthesis of specific compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (II) is prepared as shown in Scheme 4. Selective o-decyclopentylation of compound of general formula (15), wherein Ra is cyclopentyl. is carried out under acidic condition (e.g. 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid) to give corresponding monohydroxy compound of general formula (16). Alkyaltion of mono hydroxy compound of general formula (16) with appropriate alkyl halide of the formula (18) using suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride, cesium carbonate) in a suitable solvent (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide; tetrahydrofuran) affords compound of the present invention represented by the general formula (II). Exhaustive dealkylation of compound of general formula (15) wherein Ra is cyclopropylmethyl. is carried out using an appropriate Lewis acid (e.g. boron tribromide) to give corresponding dihydroxy compound of general formula (17). The dihydroxy compound (17) can be alkylated in a sequential mode to give an unsymmetrical dialkoxy compound. Thus, intermediate (17) is mono alkylated using one equivalent of an appropriate electrophile of the formula (18) (wherein X is halogen) using a base such as cesium carbonate in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. which on further alkylation with a different electrophile of the formula (19) (wherein X is halogen) using a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride, cesium carbonate) in a suitable solvent (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran) affords compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (II).<br><br><br>

Pharmacological activity<br>
The illustrative examples of the present invention are screened for TRPV3 activity according to a modified procedure described in (a) Toth, A. el a/. Life Sciences 2003, 73, 487-498. (b) McNamara C, R. et at. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2007; 104, 13525-13530. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Screening for TRPV3 antagonist using the 45Calcium uptake assay<br>
The inhibition of TRPV3 receptor activation was followed as inhibition of 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium. Test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare 20 mM stock solution and then diluted using plain medium with DMEM/ F-12 containing 1.8 mM<br><br>
CaCl2 to get desired concentration. Final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPV3 expressing CHO cells were grown in DMEM/ F-12 medium with 10% FBS; 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 400 ug / mL of G-418. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get - 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with test compounds for 10 minutes followed by addition of 2-APB at a final concentration of 500 uM and 5 uCi/mL 43CaT2for 4 minutes, Cells were washed and lysed using buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in Packardt Top count after addition of liquid scintillant. Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. IC50 value was calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.<br>
The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 1. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 uM and 10.0 uM are given in the table along with IC50 (nM) values for selected examples.<br>
The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 1 wherein "A" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, "B" refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 150.0 nM and "C" refers to an IC50 value in range of 150.01 to 1000.0 nM.<br>
