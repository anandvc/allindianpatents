iThird Embodiment)<br>
hn  e&gt;:plan.^tion will be given of a third embodimenr of .:in absorption chiller-heat'Sr constituted by applying the inv^ention m reference to Fig. 1, Tig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 .r.5 folJ.ows.  Fig, 6 is a diagram for explaining a way of <::iet-srmi.ning a set temperature in correspondence with the :re t:errperature inlet te.:nper5tur of ceding water absorption chiller-heater ccri.3tituted by applying invention fig. is diagram ro explaining other way determining teraperature :..n correspijncence generator co.::respond input cooling tb-.-: ab:5orpti::.n constituted in:7ention. fig- ii5 for still cf: j-ecjeneratoj: consjtituted invention. further according to t embodimei-nt con3titution or like sam.e as those cf che first eind second embodiments attached nouation. an explanation thereof will be omirted and></::iet-srmi.ning><br><: will be given of a characterizing portion or the whiich differs from those fir and second>3dinient^&gt;..<br>
Although the ei*!)bodiri:;ent carrier: out a control similar t:o 'ihoso of "he first and ths second embod:_rr.ents, the embodiment C;!:L:'fers in t.h.z.t an inl'^r temperature to the absorber of cooling v;a":er is defected and the set temperature in correspondence wiiih the rec'i-in.srator temperature is changed in accordance v/ith th»:; inlet iiernperature of cooling water.<br>
For e&gt;:ample^ as shown by Fig. 1, the lower the temtperature of cooling water supplied from the cooling 'v&gt;;ater passage 45 to the absorber 3, that is, the inlet temperature to the ab.sorber 9 o::  cooling v;ater, the lov;er the temperature of the d u:'^ictiy fired regen(=rator 3 and therefcre, the hea- input a:.r-ount until the regenerator temperature reaches a plurality o:i! i'jet Lempt:ratures previously set in correspondence with the r:;5c=:nerator temperature is increased. Therefore^ fuel cor; iump'iior. at the directly fired regener^^tor 3 is increased.<br>
Further, when temperature of cooling ^'7ater supplied from t;ye cooling v.^ater passage to zhe absorber 9/ that is, the inlet to.n',3er3':ure tc the absorber 9 of cooling water is comparatively J r.'w ano the ^vxz conditioning load is comparatively low, ^:r:C(5rding zo the absorption chiller-heaters of the first and t:'.e second =::'.ibodiments, depending on the way of determining trie set temperatures in correspondence with the regenerator<br><br>
tiMuperature, there is a case in which a reduction in the heat ;;::put anoun-:::^ to the exhaust heat fired regenerator 1 and the d.::::ectly Jiired regenerator 3 is not carried cut even v;hen the   • ir^put amoi::rii:s are excessive* When such a state is brought about,, thc-r-: is ^  case in which the concentration of the concentrated solution is concentrated rciore than necessary and :;::-y£talli;!:a-::ion of the absorbent solution or the like is b]:'Ought about-<br>
Ther^^'fore, according to the absorption chiller-heater of the embodiment, as shown by Fig, 1, the control portion 11 •ietects tY.t inlet temperature of cooling water by using the 'reeling med:..L-m terttperature sensor 53 fcr detecting che v:e]rper.atu.r-.;-. c-f cooling water in an inlet porrion of the cooling vja'irer passage 45, Further, as shov/n by Fig. 6, in proportion CO the inlet temperature of cooling v/ater detected by the ootolin.tj medium temperature sensor 53, the sat rempera-cure in r:o:':resi)cndent:e with the regenerator temperature, that is, the set terr.parc.::L-.res Tgl, Tg2, Tg3, Tg4 when the heat input amount :Ls reduced :.n the first and ~he second enbodiments and the set i:.e:;'iperature;= Tgl', Tg2', Tg3' , Tg4' when the heat input amount ;.s incj:easc5c are changed,<br>
In t:li.^ way, by changing the set temperature in ::-o].-respondeno'G v.-ith the regenerator temperature as a linear fu^irjtion of r.he input temperature of cooling water, when the •:..5:nperc;tur?; cf cooling water is lowered, the set temperature<br><br>
ir. correspondence with the regenerator temperature is also Icv/ered- Thtrrefore, the he£.t input amoant until tha ;,:e cenerator tieinper^iture reaches the plurality of set ■;:;e:T.peratur::.i': previously set in correspondence with the :i;eoanefatC'r temperature can be rastrained from being increased; ;i:'u<sl consv-n-ption at the directly fired regenerator can be iretiuceti anc3 energy conservation perforn-ance promoted.></sl>
I^urtlier, there can be restrained a state in vAich a reciuction in the heat input amounts to the exhaust heai: fired .rerjenerato;: 1   and the directly fired regenerator 3 is not t;a3:rie<i ou despite that the heat input amounts are excessive>Ti being brought about by "he inlet temperature of the cooling v/at.er. Thtt.::■■:= fore, crystallization of the absorbent solution ]:y  concensinc the concentration of the concentrated solution nor-2 than nx5ces5:ary can be restrained by the inlet tenperature of the coo].:.ng warer and therefore, reliability of the .■■b:':'Orpt-ion chiller-heater can further be promoted.<br>
lurthej:^ although according to the embodiment, "here is ^h',:v/n a case of changing the set temperature in correspondence V,ii:.h the regenerator temperature in proportion to the inlet t;eu'per.3tur'r of the cooling water, as shown by Fig, 7, the set teiTiperaturtt in correspondence v/ith the regenerator t:er:;peratur(i: can be elevated in steps by setting set t';jr:.peratur(^s Tcol^ Tco2 (TCO1<tgo2 previously in correspondence vdth inlet temperature of the cooling v></tgo2><br>
ar.cl wh'^n t:\e. inlet teraperature of the cooling water becomes :jcaal ■;o cr higher than Tool and becomes equal to or higher ::hBn Tco2, Further^ as shown by Fig. 8, the set temperature .in correspondence with rhe regenerator temperature can also ):)e changed in. proportion to the inlet temperature of the cooling L/aMer detec:t(=:d by the cooling medium temperature isensor 53 bc'.:ween Tcol and Tco2.<br>
Purther, although according to the first through the i;h;"-rd embodinentS; the regenerator temperature is constituted by a hi.gher one of either temperature of "che teniperature of zh^'i  exhaust gas fired regenerator i and the directly fired .1 erjene^.-ator 3,. However, sines the xiemperatures of the exhaust ]-.e::t fj.red rc;generator and the directly fired regenerator i::'e:;ome temp'^sratures further proximate to each other by <: i fee solution it is also possible that temperature de iir p.rovided to either one of the temperatures>:i':.aust. hec:i; fired regenerator and the temperature of the diLrectly fi/rtid regenerator and a control is carried out by cori.stitutir..g ':he regenerator temperature by the temp-erature c:;: one of 'zrv^i  regenerators provided V7i':h the temperature c'erectcr*  In this ciase, the directly fired regenerator is dLiiposeo GV:  the downstream side of the exhaust heac fired rs=';:ene:r:aT;o:: with respect to flow o£ the solution and therefore^ ev(.in  when f:ea-: is inputted only to the exhaust gas fired I'egenerator, the temperature of the directly fired regenerator<br><br>
ir. :iica-es a teriiperature substantially the same as that of the<br>
-.^&gt;;hau3': h^.Eit f:,red regenerator. Therefore, when the ■;:e:r:peratur'ti detector is provided to only one of the :i:-eoen'^-;:atc.:s, by providing the temperature detector to the ::ii::ect:.y fired regenerator, the heat input amounts to the :;e
In ac::::i Lion tneretO; even when the temperature detector ^■ri; providejci t'o both of the exhaust heat fired regenerator and v..hi'j directly fired regenerator, the control can be carried out i:.o':, only b;/ ::onstituting the regenerator temperature by a hi-::her one :^i: either one of the temperature of the exhaust heat f::,:.:ed reger.;.rator 1 -^no the temperature of the directly fired rEet;jenerator 3 but alsio constituting the regenerator t;er:perature by either one of the temperat:ures of the exhaust he.:it fired --r'^cjenera^or and the directly fired regenerator by other m
