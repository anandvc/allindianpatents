				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to molding devices in general and to a molding device for forming<br>
plastic containers in particular.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Processes and molding devices for production of containers are known in the prior art (DE<br>
199 26 329 A1, US 3,883,186 and US 3,877,861), ones in which a hose of plasticized plastic<br>
material is extruded into a molding mechanism, one end of the hose is closed by heat sealing and<br>
the hose is expanded by generation of a pneumatic pressure gradient acting on the hose and<br>
applied to the molding wall of the molding mechanism consisting of two opposite molding tools<br>
for form the container. The plastic container is then filled under sterile conditions into the<br>
molding mechanism by way of an appropriate charging mandrel and, after the charging mandrel<br>
has been removed, is hermetically sealed, a specific head geometry being formed. For the<br>
purpose of forming the plastic container proper, in which fluid is later stored, two container<br>
molding jaws may be moved toward each other by hydraulic drive means in order to obtain a<br>
closing position and away from each other into one of their opening positions.<br>
The head geometries to be generated by the two separately actuatable head jaws regularly<br>
also comprise the neck component of the plastic container, including one in the form of ampules,<br>
which, closed by a head piece by way of a separation point, may be opened for a fluid removal<br>
process as soon as the head piece is separated by way of a separation point from a toggle piece<br>
molded on it and in this way removed from the plastic container proper.<br>
Such processes have been disclosed in a plurality of embodiments and are widely used in<br>
packing systems for liquid or paste products, for example, in the disclosed bottlepack 7 system<br>
The hydraulic drive systems regularly employed in practical applications for the respective<br>
feed movement of the molding tool present problems in that any leakage may result in fouling<br>
with the fluid, something which results in problems especially when the molding machines are<br>
used for plastic containers in the pharmaceutical and food packaging spheres and in medical<br>
technology in general. The maintenance cost is also increased and the hydraulic drive systems do<br>
not reach the desired or high cycle frequencies for mass production for the sake of precise<br>
positioning; of the molding tools for shaping of containers.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
On the basis of this prior art the object of the invention is to create a molding device for moving<br>
at least one molding tool, a tool making it possible to apply modern drive concepts, such as ones<br>
in the form of electric or pneumatic drives, the maintenance cost of which is reduced and which<br>
permit especially high rates of output of goods to be produced, such as plastic containers, along<br>
with high positioning accuracy for the molding tools. The object as thus formulated is attained by<br>
means of a molding device with the characteristics as disclosed hereunder.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In the molding device claimed for the invention a link motion control element is provided for<br>
moving at least one molding tool, especially one for generation of container geometries in plastic<br>
containers; this element moves the respective molding tool to a closing position at least for mold,<br>
the link motion control element being actuatable by a drive. On the basis of the link motion<br>
control element a novel drive and movement concept is presented for the respective molding<br>
tool, one which makes it possible to dispense with hydraulic drive means entirely and by<br>
preference to employ an electric or pneumatic drive as the drive means. The link motion control<br>
element in question may, however, continue to be actuated conventionally by<br>
means of a hydraulic drive if the respective application appears to call for it and rigid<br>
requirements have not been set for sterile filling or clean room qualities.<br>
The molding device claimed for the invention with drivable link motion control element<br>
for a closing movement with the molding device permits uniform, safe, and position-accurate<br>
driving of the respective molding tool and entails only a minor maintenance effort. The link<br>
motion control elenent may be employed to execute a plurality of opening and closing processes<br>
in rapid sequence; with the molding device claimed for the invention this results in high output<br>
of goods to be produced, in particular those in the form of blow-molded plastic containers filled<br>
under sterile conditions.<br>
In one pref srred embodiment of the device claimed for the invention the link motion<br>
control element has a slot guide positioned on the exterior circumference on a body of rotation<br>
actuatable by a drive. By preference provision is also made such that there is engaged in the slot<br>
guide an actuating member which operates in conjunction with a slide component and such that,<br>
during rotation of he slot guide from one of its end positions to its other end position and vice<br>
versa, the slide component with molding tool which may be associated with it may be displaced<br>
with the molding tool by way of the actuating member which my be moved longitudinally in this<br>
manner from a closing position to an opening position of the mold shaped by the respective<br>
molding tool and vice versa. Safe and precise positioning control is achieved as a result, along<br>
with clearly defined specific closing forces specified by the link motion control element.<br>
In another especially preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the<br>
invention, the max imum closing force for the molding tool may be specified by way of central<br>
adjusting means on the slide component means preferably in the form of an energy accumulator.<br>
Pressure spring elements, such as ones in the form of disk springs or the like, are suitable for use<br>
as energy accumulators. Independently of the closing force of the link motion control element<br>
which is applied, this force may be appreciably limited, and the reliability of shaping thereby<br>
increased, by way of the adjusting means. It has been found in configuration of the molding<br>
device to be especially cost-effective to mount the body of rotation together with the drive so as<br>
to be stationary on a machine frame in relation to which the slide component may move back and<br>
forth along its rail guide. A rigid machine configuration is achieved for the slide component and<br>
for the molding device as a whole and obstacles in operation are reliably eliminated on the basis<br>
of the rail guide in question.<br>
In another especially preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the<br>
invention, the molding tools mounted opposite each other may be moved by a single link motion<br>
control element syachronously by way of a common driving component. By preference<br>
provision is also rrade such that at least four link motion control elements positioned in pairs,<br>
one opposite the ether, may be driven by gearing actuatable by the drive and the common drive<br>
component. As a result, a total of four molding tools with mold geometries mounted in sequence<br>
may be actuated in pairs operating together synchronously for shaping and mold opening<br>
processes in order to produce several container geometries.<br>
In one preferred embodiment provision is also made as protection from collision such<br>
that a monitoring i ssembly monitors the position of the link motion control element, at least with<br>
respect to the position of the molding tool in its closing position, but preferably also in its<br>
opening position.<br>
It has also been found to be favorable for obstacle-free operation in one preferred<br>
embodiment of the molding device claimed for the invention for the path equation for the slot<br>
guide of the body of rotation to be executed as a Bestehom sinoid.<br>
The device claimed for the invention will be described in detail below with reference to<br>
an exemplary embodiment illustrated in the drawing, in which not drawn to scale<br>
Brief description of the accompaying drawing:<br>
FIG. 1 presents a top view of the molding device as a whole;<br>
FIG. 2 an enlarged section of FIG. 1 representing the upper left segment of the latter;<br>
FIG. 3 the development of the path geometry of a link motion control element mounted<br>
on a body of rotation and having slot guides such as the path geometry applied in<br>
the nolding device shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
First a part of the molding device as a whole for moving a molding tool 10 will be<br>
described with reference to the upper left segment of the illustration in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. On its<br>
free front side the molding tool 10 has trough-like recesses (not shown) which form mold halves<br>
for generation of container geometries for plastic containers (not shown), including ones in the<br>
form of ampules. For the purpose of generating the respective container geometries the molding<br>
tool 10 operates in conjunction with a corresponding molding tool 10a with correspondingly<br>
shaped recesses (not shown), the two molding tools 10, 10a being in the closed molding position<br>
shown in FIG. 1, in which position the free front surfaces of the molding tools 10, 10a meet<br>
along a closing separation line I -I.<br>
For the purpose of moving the respective molding tool 10, 10a use is made of a link<br>
motion control element designated as a whole as 12 which may be driven by means of a centrally<br>
mounted drive 14. For the sake of simplicity there is shown in FIG. 1 only the spline shaft of the<br>
drive which may be coupled to the driven shaft of an electric motor, such as one in the form of<br>
an electric stepping; motor, and permits driving of the link motion control element 12. For this<br>
purpose the spline shaft 14 is rotatably mounted by way of bearings 16 in a machine frame 18<br>
and has a drive gear 20 on its one free side facing the molding tool 10. The drive gear 20 in<br>
question meshes with a driven gear 22 of the link motion control element 12. The link motion<br>
control element 12 has a slot guide 24 which is positioned on the external circumference side on<br>
a body of rotation 26 which may be powered by drive 14 and which is essentially cylindrical in<br>
configuration. The respective slot guide 24 has two path or curve segments 28 resulting from<br>
development of the body of rotation 26 as show in FIG. 3. The respective path curve of a curve<br>
segment 28 obeys a path equation for a Bestehorn sinoid. The respective body of rotation 26<br>
with its path curve segments 28 need not be configured to be identical for the molding tool 10a to<br>
the body of rotation 26 for the molding tool 10. In this instance slight adaptations may be<br>
necessary with respect to the control curve pattern. However, the bodies of rotation 26 of the<br>
two mold halves 10, 10a are in other respects essentially the same.<br>
An actuating member 30 in the form of a cam follower engages the slot guide 24 with its<br>
two path curve segments 28. The actuating member 30 in question is mounted rotatably on<br>
opposite sides of a slide component 32 so that, as the body of rotation 26 with its slot guide 24<br>
rotates, uniform advance in the direction of closing of the molding tools 10, 10a is ensured, along<br>
with uniform reset) ing movement into a corresponding opening position, the respective rearward<br>
position being indicated by a broken-line circle at the top left in FIG. 1 and in FIG. 2. When the<br>
slot guide 24 rotates from one of its end areas 34 to the other end area 36 of a path curve segment<br>
28, the slide component 32 may be displaced longitudinally in one direction of movement and in<br>
the other direction when the body of rotation rotates in the opposite direction. Consequently, the<br>
maximum path of travel which may be reached for the slide component 32 thus is determined by<br>
the longitudinal axial distance between the end areas 34, 36 opposite each other of two different<br>
path curve segment 28 of a slot guide 24 of a body of rotation 26.<br>
The slide component 32 has on its frontal side facing the molding tool 10 a guide<br>
component 38 on which the respective molding tool 20 may be mounted so as to be replaceable<br>
and on the edge side the guide component 38 is mounted so that it may be displaced axially in<br>
the longitudinal direction along two rail guides 40, the ends of the rail guides ,40 being<br>
appropriately mounted in the machine frame 18. In addition, the guide component 38 is retained<br>
so that it may be displaced longitudinally in a displacement component 42 of the slide<br>
component in a dirjction in parallel with the rail guides 40, the displacement component 42<br>
resting on adjusting means 44 in the form of a disk spring package which functions as a<br>
compression spring. In this way the maximum closing force for the molding tool 10 may be<br>
determined by way of the adjusting means 44 so that a reliably operating shaping process is<br>
made possible.<br>
In the line c of sight to FIG. 1 a drive component 46 in the form of a drive shaft is mounted<br>
at the top in paralle 1 with the upper rail guide 40. At both ends of the drive shaft 46 a crown gear<br>
48, 48a is connected to this shaft, so that, as the body of rotation 26 moves by way of the drive<br>
shaft 14, the driven gear 22 meshes with the crown gear 48, thereby driving the drive shaft 46,<br>
which in turn trans nits the driving power by way of the crown gear 48a on the opposite side to<br>
the following driven gear 22 of the body of rotation 26 following in the drive chain.<br>
Consequently, the molding tools 10, 10a mounted opposite each other may be actuated and<br>
moved in pairs by a single link motion control element 12 with drive 14, by way of the common<br>
drive component 46. Hence, molding tools 10, 10a move synchronously into their opening<br>
position and into treir closing position along the closing separation line I -I.<br>
As is also to be seen in the illustration in FIG. 1, four link motion control elements 12<br>
positioned opposite: each other in pairs may thus be actuated in the drive direction appropriate for<br>
back-and-forth movement of the slide components 32 of the molding device by way of the gears<br>
operated by the drive 14 and consisting of gears 20, 22 and 48, 48a. The respective drive is very<br>
accurate and permits precise positioning of the respective molding tool 10, 10a for a molding<br>
process. In addition, the molding tools 10 opposite each other in one line may be connected to<br>
each other on one side, but may also be separated from each other, that which has been stated<br>
also applying correspondingly to molding tools 10a mounted opposite each other.<br>
As is also to be seen in FIG. 2, a monitoring assembly 50 is provided. It is spring-loaded<br>
and may be displaced longitudinally from its locking position illustrated in FIG. 2 into a release<br>
position, preferably from the exterior by way of an actuator, in particular one in the form of a<br>
pneumatic cylinder or the like. The body of rotation 26 accordingly has on the external<br>
circumference side a first recess 52 which corresponds to the closing position of the molding<br>
tools 10, 10a. If looking occurs in this locking position, that is, if parts of the monitoring<br>
assembly 50 are engaged in the associated recess 52 in the body of rotation 26, it is made certain<br>
that a locking position has been assumed along the closing separation line I -I by the molding<br>
tools 10, 10a and flat the machine control unit then recognizes that a reliable molding process is<br>
possible. If as a result of an error the position in question is not assumed, the monitoring<br>
assembly 50 ascertains this and the molding process could be halted without damage to the<br>
molding device. The reset opening position area for the molding tools 10, 10a may also be<br>
monitored synchronously by way of the monitoring assembly 50, by means of a recess (not<br>
shown) positioned diametrically opposite recess 52. In addition, the drive shaft 46 is mounted on<br>
the end side so as to be rotatable, by way of additional bearings 54 in the machine frame 18.<br>
The configuration of the molding device as described makes it possible to reach very high<br>
cycle speeds in production of molded containers of a plastic material, along with very high<br>
machining accuracy, in view of the specifiable accuracy of positioning of the molding tools 10,<br>
10a, with respect both to their closing position and to movement apart into their opening position<br>
for the production mold. The molding device is very rigidly configured from the viewpoint of its<br>
structural design, so that precise actuation of the moving parts is ensured, while the molding<br>
device may be very cost-effectively produced and maintained because of the equivalent parts<br>
employed.<br>
