A RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and particularly, to a suction gas guiding system for a reciprocating compressor which is suitable for introducing suction gas into a compressor unit smoothly, and for reducing suction noise in case of installing the compressor unit inside a reciprocating motor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, a reciprocating compressor can be divided into a compressor which compresses and discharges the sucked gas by changing a rotating movement of a driving motor into a reciprocating motion of a piston, and a compressor which compresses and discharges the sucked gas by making the piston undergo reciprocating movement while the driving motor undergoes linear reciprocating movement.<br>
Figure 1 is a transverse cross-sectional view showing an embodiment of the reciprocating compressor in which the driving motor undergoes the linear reciprocating movement.<br>
As shown therein, a conventional reciprocating compressor comprises a shell 10 in which a suction pipe (SP) and a discharge conduit (DP) are communicated with each other ; a reciprocating motor 20 fixed inside the shell 10; a compressor unit 30 installed inside the reciprocating motor 10, sucking,<br><br>
2<br>
compressing, and discharging gas; a frame unit 40 supporting the reciprocating motor 20 and the compressor unit 30; and a spring unit 50 elastically supporting an armature 22 of the reciprocating motor 20 in motion direction and guiding a resonance.<br>
The reciprocating motor 20 includes a stator 21 including an inner stator 21A and an outer stator 21B, and an armature 22 disposed in a gap between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B and undergoing a reciprocating movement.<br>
The compressor unit 30 comprises a piston 31. coupled to a magnet supporting member 22A of the reciprocating motor 20 and undergoing the reciprocating movement together with the magnet supporting member 22A; a cylinder 32 fixed on a front frame 41 which will be described later and forming a compressing space with the piston; a suction vaive 33 installed on front end of the piston and restricting the suction of gas by opening/closing a gas passing hole 31b of the piston which will be described later; and a discharge valve assembly 34 disposed on the front end of the cylinder 32, whereby covering the compressing space, and restricting the discharge of compressed gas.<br>
An inner flowing passage 31a communicating with the suction pipe (SP) is formed to a certain depth inside the piston 31, and the gas passing hole 31b communicated with the inner flowing passage 31a and penetrated to front end surface of the piston 31 is formed.<br>
The frame unit 40 includes a front frame 41 contacting to front surfaces of the inner stator 21A and of the outer stator 21B, whereby supporting the stators<br><br>
3<br>
together, and in which the cylinder 32 is inserted; a middle frame 42 contacting to rear surface of the outer stator 21B, whereby supporting the outer stator 21B; and a rear frame 43 coupled to the middle frame 42 and supporting rear end of a rear spring 52 which will be described later.<br>
The spring unit 50 includes front spring 51 having both ends supported by the front surface of coupled part of the magnet supporting member 22A and the piston 31 and by the corresponding inner surface of the front frame 41, and a rear spring 52 having both ends supported by rear surface of the coupled part of the magnet supporting member 22A and the piston 31, and by corresponding front surface of the rear frame 43.<br>
Reference numeral 22B designates a magnet.<br>
The conventional reciprocating compressor as described above is operated as follows.<br>
That is, when an electric current is applied to the winding coil 21C installed on the outer stator 21B of the reciprocating motor 20 and a flux is generated between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B, whereby the armature 22 located in the gap between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B moves in  accordance with  the  direction of the flux and  undergoes  reciprocating movement by the spring unit 50. And accordingly, the piston 22 coupled to the armature 22 undergoes reciprocating movement inside the cylinder 32, so that a volume variance is generated inside the compressing space, accordingly the refrigerant gas is sucked into the compressing space, then compressed and discharged.<br><br>
4<br>
The refrigerant gas is sucked inside the shell 10 through the suction pipe (SP) during the suction stroke of the piston, and the gas is sucked into the compressing space of the cylinder 32 as opening the suction valve 33 through the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston 31 and through the gas passing hole 31b. Then, the gas is compressed to a certain level during the compress stroke of the piston, and discharged through the discharge conduit 34 as opening the discharge valve assembly 34. And the whole process is repeated.<br>
However, in the conventional reciprocating compressor as described above, the refrigerant gas sucked into the shell 10 through the suction pipe (SP) is dispersed inside the shell 10, whereby the density per unit volume is lowered. Accordingly, the actual amount of refrigerant gas sucked into the compressing space during the reciprocating movement of the piston 31 is low, whereby the efficiency of the compressor is lowered.<br>
Also, the refrigerant gas sucked into the shell 10 is pre-heated by contacting to the reciprocating motor 20 inside the shell 10, and then the gas is sucked into the compressing space. Therefore, the specific volume of the refrigerant gas is increased, and the performance of the compressor is lowered.<br>
Also, when the suction valve 33 is opened/closed, the suction valve 33 is impacted to the front end surface of the piston 31, whereby the impact noise generated thereof is transferred to inside of the shell 10 entirely, and the noise of the entire compressor is increased.<br>
In addition, when the suction valve 33 is opened/closed, the counter-flowing   refrigerant   gas   is   impacted   with   the   sucked   refrigerant   gas<br><br>
5<br>
instantaneously, whereby a pressure pulsation is generated. And the pressure pulsation is transferred to the suction pipe (SP) through the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston 31, and thereby the suction of the refrigerant gas is disturbed and the efficiency of the compressor is lowered.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, to solve the problems of the conventional art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a suction gas guide system for a reciprocating compressor which increase efficiency of the compressor by introducing sucked gas inside a shell to a compressing space, and thereby increasing a density of the refrigerant gas per unit volume.<br>
Also it is an another object of the present invention to provide a suction gas guide system for a reciprocating compressor which is able to increase the efficiency of the compressor by preventing the sucked gas from being pre-heated before introduced into the compressing space and thereby preventing the increase of a specific volume of the gas.<br>
In addition, it is still another object of the present invention to provide a suction gas guide system for a reciprocating compressor which is able to reduce the noise of the compressor by attenuating an impact noise generated from impact of the suction valve to a front end surface of the piston when the refrigerant gas is sucked.<br>
Also it is still another object of the present invention to provide a suction gas guide system for a reciprocating compressor which is able to suck the<br><br>
6<br>

9<br>
reciprocating movement together; a cylinder 32 fixed to a front frame 41, which will be described later, so that the piston inserted into the cylinder slidably, and forming a compressing space with the piston; a suction valve 33 installed on the front end of the piston 31 and restricting suction of the gas by opening/ciosing a gas passing hole 31b of the piston 31, which will be described later; and a discharge valve assembly 34 installed on front end surface of the cylinder 32, covering the compressing space, and restricting discharge of the compressed gas.<br>
An inner flowing passage 31a communicated with the suction pipe (SP) is formed to have a certain depth inside the piston 31, and a gas passing hole 31b communicating with the inner flowing passage 31a and penetrated to the front end surface of the piston is formed inside the piston 31.<br>

10<br>
The gas guide unit 100 may include a guide conduit, or may include two or more guide conduits. Herein, a gas guide unit including two guide conduits will be described.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the gas guide unit 100 includes a first guide conduit 110 coupled to the piston 31 so as to be inserted into the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston 31; and a second guide conduit 120 inserted inside the first guide conduit 110 so that a front side of the second guide conduit 120 is overlapped at a certain range and coupled on a same axial line with the first guide conduit.<br>
The first guide conduit 110 is fixedly screwed using a volt (not shown) on a flange unit 31c formed on rear end of the piston 31 so as to be coupled to the magnet supporting member 22A, and the second guide conduit 120 is fixedly screwed using a volt (not shown) on an inner surface of the rear frame 43 of the frame unit 40.<br>
An outer diameter of the first guide conduit 110 is formed shorter than an inner diameter of the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston, so that a first resonant space (S1) between the outer surface of the first guide conduit 110 and the corresponding inner surface of the piston 31. In addition, the rear end of the first guide conduit 110 abuts to the flange unit 31c formed on the rear end of the piston 31, but the front end of the first guide conduit 110 communicates with the inner flowing passage 31a because the length of the first guide conduit 110 is shorter than that of the entire inner flowing passage 31a formed inside the piston 31.<br><br>
11<br>
Also, on the front end of the first guide conduit 110, an outward flange unit 111 toward the inner circumferential wall of the inner flowing passage 31a so that the entrance of the first resonant space (S1) is stepped.<br>
On the other hand, the second guide conduit 120 includes a large conduit unit 121 fixed to the rear frame 43, and a small conduit unit 122 coupled to the front side of the large conduit unit 121 and inserted into the first guide conduit 110.<br>
The large conduit unit 121 includes a baffle unit 121A dividing the inside of the large conduit unit 121 into a plurality of resonant spaces (S2 and S3) is installed at least one (a baffle unit is shown in Figure), and it is desirable that the baffle unit 121A is installed in a vertical direction against the flowing direction of the gas.<br>
Also, the large conduit unit 121 includes the baffle unit 121A; a first conduit unit 121B and a second conduit unit 121C-forming a body with the baffle unit 121A and forming a second resonant space (S2) and a third resonant space (S3) by coupling both sides of the baffle unit 121A; and a first side plate unit 121D and a second side plate unit 121E coupling to the other sides of the first and second conduit unit 121B and 121C, respectively.<br>
Outer diameters of the first conduit unit 121B and the second conduit unit 121C are formed same as those of the baffle unit 121A and the respective side plate units 121D and 121E, and bores 121a, 121d, and 121e are formed in a central part of the baffle unit 121A and of the respective side plate units 121D and 121E at the same axial line with those of the suction pipe (SP), the small conduit unit 122, and the inner flowing passage 31a.<br><br>
12<br>
The first side plate unit 121D is located on front side of the large conduit unit 121, in which the small conduit unit 122 is coupled on its bore 121d, and a flange unit (not defined as a reference numeral) coupled to the rear frame 43 is formed on the second side plate unit 121E.<br>
Also, it is desirable that an inner edge of the entrance of the small conduit unit 122 is formed round. In addition, the first conduit unit 121B and the first side plate 121D may be formed as a single body, and the other members are able to be welded by an ultrasonic welding or a brazing method.<br>
Same components as those of the conventional art are designated by the same reference numerals.<br>
Reference numeral 22B designates a magnet.<br>
The suction gas guide system of a reciprocating compressor according to the present invention has effects as follows.<br>
 That is, when an electric source is applied to the reciprocating motor 20, accordingly a flux is formed between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B, whereby the armature 22 with the piston 31 moves in accordance with the direction of the flux and undergoes linear reciprocating movement by the spring unit 50. Then, the piston 31 coupled to the armature 22 undergoes the linear reciprocating movement inside the cylinder 32 so that a pressure variance is repeatedly generated inside the cylinder 32. Accordingly, due to the pressure variance inside the cylinder 32, the refrigerant gas is sucked into the compressing space of the cylinder 32 through the inner flowing passage 31a in the piston 31, then compressed and discharged. And this process is repeated.<br><br>
13<br>
Hereinafter, the process will be described in more detail. First, as shown in Figure 5, the refrigerant gas (indicated as the real line arrow in drawing) is sucked and charged inside the shell 10 through the suction pipe (SP) during the suction stroke of the piston 31, and after that, the refirgerant gas charged in the shell 10 is sucked into the compressing space of the cylinder 32 as opening the suction valve 33 through the large conduit unit 121 and the small conduit unit 122 of the second guide conduit 120, the first guide conduit 110, and the gas passing hole 31b on the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston 31 during the continued suction stroke of the piston 31.<br>
At that time, before the refrigerant gas sucked into the shell 10 is dispersed entire shelf 10, the gas is guided to the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston through the respective guide conduits 110 and 120, and the refrigerant gas guided into the inner flowing passage 31a is directly sucked into the compressing space as opening the suction valve 33 through the gas passing 31b, whereby the density of the gas per unit volume is increased, and therefore the efficiency of the compressor is able to be increased.<br>
Also, as the refrigerant gas sucked into the shell 10 through the suction pipe (SP) is guided to the compressing space of the cylinder 43 through the gas guide unit 100, a direct contact of the gas to the motor can be prevented to a certain extent. And thereby increase of the specific volume of the refrigerant gas is able to be restrained, and accordingly, the amount of sucked gas is increased, whereby the efficiency of the compressor can be increased.<br>
Also, the first guide conduit 110 and the second guide conduit 120 of the<br><br>
14 gas guide unit 100 are disposed to be overlapped always when the piston 31<br>
undergoes the reciprocating movement, and therefore the leakage of the refrigerant gas during the suction of the gas is able to be reduced. Accordingly, the suction rate of the refrigerant gas is increased, whereby the efficiency of the compressor also is able to be increased.<br>
Also, the suction pipe (SP), the first guide conduit 110 and the second guide conduit 120 are disposed at the same axial line, especially, even though the large conduit unit 121 is located on the sucking side of the second guide conduit 120, the connecting part of the large conduit unit 121 and the small conduit unit 122 is formed as round, whereby the refrigerant gas is directly sucked into the compressing space of the cylinder 32 through the suction pipe (SP). Therefore, the suction rate of the refrigerant gas is increased, and the efficiency of the compressor can be increased.<br>
After that, as shown in Figure 6, the refrigerant gas in the compressing space of the cylinder 32 is compressed during the compressing stroke of the piston 31, and then the gas is discharged by opening the discharge valve 34.<br>
At that time, the suction valve 33 opened during the suction of the refrigerant gas is closed, and then the suction valve 33 is impacted to the front surface of the piston 31, whereby an impact noise (indicated as dotted line arrows in the drawing) between the valve 33 and the piston 31 is generated. And the noise travels in a direction opposite to the suction direction of the gas, but the noise of low frequency is attenuated in the first resonant space (S1) formed between the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston and the first guide conduit 110,   and the noise<br><br>
15<br>
of high frequency is attenuated through the second resonant space (S2) and the third resonant space (S3) formed on the large conduit unit 121 in the second guide conduit 120, whereby the reliability of the compressor is increased.<br>
Also, as the suction valve 33 is opened/closed, some of the refrigerant gas being sucked is counter flown, and accordingly the counter-flowing refrigerant gas causes a pressure pulsation by impact with the refrigerant gas being sucked through the inner flowing passage 31a of the piston 31. Then, the pressure pulsation disturbs the suction of the refrigerant gas by flowing to the opposite of the suction direction. However, the pressure pulsation is somewhat attenuated with the impact noise while flowing through the respective resonant space (S1, S2, and S3), whereby the amount of the refrigerant gas newly sucked is able to be increased, and the efficiency of the compressor can be increased.<br>
In addition, the large conduit unit 121 is fixed on the rear frame 43 and does not move with the reciprocating movement of the piston 31, and therefore the flow resistance is restrained and the efficiency of the compressor is able to be increased.<br>
Moreover, when the gas guide unit 100 is assembled, the large conduit unit 121 is molded as separated members and fabricated by the ultrasonic welding or by the brazing, and after that the large conduit unit 121 is assembled. Therefore the assembling process of the gas guide unit 100 is made in simple way, whereby the productivity can be increased.<br>
Hereinafter, the another embodiment of the suction gas guide system for a reciprocating motor according to the present invention will be described.<br><br>
16<br>
In the embodiment described above, the first guide conduit 110 and the second guide conduit 120 are fixed on the piston 31 and on the frame 43 respectively as separate bodies. However, in the present embodiment, as shown in  Figure 7, a first guide conduit 210 and a second guide conduit 220 may be fixed on the piston 31 together, or as shown in Figure 8, a first guide conduit 310 and a second guide conduit 320 may be fixed on the frame 43 together.<br>
As for the embodiment shown in Figure 7, in case that the first guide conduit 210 and the second guide conduit 220 are fixed on the piston 31, the first guide conduit 210 is formed extending forward so as to be inserted in the inner flowing passage 31a, and the second guide conduit 220 is formed extending backward so as to oppose against the suction pipe (SP) of the shell 10 and to be overlapped with the bore 43a included in the frame 43 in a certain range.<br>
Also, the first guide conduit 210 is formed to have an outer diameter shorter than the inner diameter of the piston 31 so that the outer surface of the first guide conduit 210 and the inner surface of the piston 31 form the first resonant space (S1), and an outward flange unit 211 is formed on front end of the first guide conduit 210.<br>
On the contrary, the said large conduit unit 221 is formed on the coupled part with the piston 31 of the second guide conduit 220, and the said baffle unit 221A is formed on the large conduit unit 221.
