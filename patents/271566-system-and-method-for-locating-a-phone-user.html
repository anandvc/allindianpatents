				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LOCATING A PHONE USER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to wired and wireless communication<br>
devices and more particularly relates to location enabled wired and wireless<br>
communication devices with location determination capabilities.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wireless communication devices typically include an address book for keeping<br>
track of contact information. Generally, this address book information includes the<br>
contact's name, phone number(s), email address, perhaps a street address, instant<br>
message address, and other types of information related to how to contact the person. A<br>
disadvantage of conventional address books in wireless communication devices is that<br>
the information they contain is static and must be updated by the user when the<br>
information changes.<br>
Furthermore, some conventional wireless communication devices include an<br>
ability to determine their location. Such location information may be obtained through the<br>
network or via global positioning system modules integrated with the wireless<br>
communication device. This information, however, also remains static as the inherently<br>
mobile wireless communication device moves about. Accordingly, what is needed is a<br>
system and method that addresses these and/or other problems with the conventional<br>
systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, described herein are systems and methods for locating a user of a<br>
target communication device, including wired and wireless devices, and allowing the<br>
target communication device to respond to a location request with its current location or a<br>
default location. The target communication device may also deny the location request.<br>
According to one embodiment, a request for the location of a target wireless<br>
communication device is sent to the network where the request is responded to by the<br>
network or forwarded to the target device. When the request is received by the target<br>
device, the device can deny the location request or respond to the location request with<br>
the actual location of the device (as determined by GPS or the network) or with a default,<br><br>
predetermined location. The type of response (denial, actual location, or default location)<br>
can be selected by the user of the target device on a granular, per request basis so that<br>
the user of the target device can selectively respond to location requests in an<br>
appropriate fashion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Certain embodiments as disclosed herein include systems and methods for<br>
locating a user of a target wireless communication device and allowing the target wireless<br>
communication device to deny the location request or respond to the location request<br>
with its current location or a default location. For example, one method as disclosed<br>
herein allows for a request for the location of a target wireless communication device to<br>
be responded to by the network or by the target device. Advantageously, the target<br>
device may respond on a granular, per request basis so that the user of the target device<br>
can selectively deny or respond to location requests in an appropriate fashion.<br>
After reading this description it will become apparent to one skilled in the art how<br>
to implement the invention in various embodiments and applications. However, although<br>
various embodiments of the present invention will be described herein, it is understood<br>
that these embodiments are presented by way of example only, and not limitation. As<br>
such, this detailed description of various embodiments should not be construed to limit<br>
the scope or breadth of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
Figure 1 is a high level network diagram illustrating an example system 10 for<br>
locating a mobile phone user according to an embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the system 10 comprises a plurality of wireless<br>
communication devices (also referred to herein as handsets or mobile phones) such as<br>
handsets 20 and 30. The handsets 20 and 30 are communicatively coupled with one or<br>
more networks such as network 60 via one or more base stations such as base stations<br>
40 and 50. The system 10 additionally, comprises a location server 70 that is<br>
communicatively coupled with the handsets via the network 60.<br>
The handsets 20 and 30 can be any of a variety of wireless communication<br>
devices. For example, handset 20 can be a cell phone, laptop computer, personal digital<br>
assistant, tablet computer, palmtop computer, or any other such device with the ability to<br>
communicate with the network 60 via a wireless connection. The handsets 20 and 30 are<br>
configured with a data storage area 22 and 32 respectively. The data storage areas 22<br>
and 32 may be internal or external storage devices and may also be removable storage<br>
devices.<br>
The handsets 20 and 30 are also configured with a location module 25 and 35,<br>
respectively. The location modules 25 and 35 may be implemented in hardware or<br><br>
software or some combination of the two. For example, the location module 25 may be a<br>
resident software application that is integrated with the controlling software (e.g.,<br>
operating system) on the handset 20. In certain embodiments, the location module 25<br>
may be an integrated circuit that is incorporated into the electronics of the handset 20.<br>
Additionally, the location module 25 may be an application specific integrated circuit that<br>
includes both hardware and software components.<br>
The function of a location module such as location module 25 will be described<br>
more fully below. In general, however, the location module interacts with the user to<br>
receive and store operational preferences of the user. The location module also interacts<br>
with the network and perhaps a location server 70 to determine the location of the<br>
handset 20 and provide location information according to the operational preferences of<br>
the user.<br>
In certain embodiments, the handsets 20 and 30 may also be wired<br>
communication devices that are directly connected to a communication network. For<br>
example, handset 20 may be a desktop (i.e., wired) phone in a business or residence.<br>
The location server 70 is also equipped with a data storage area 72 that can also<br>
be internal, external or removable. The location server 70 may also have a location<br>
module 75 that is configured to track the location of various handsets such as handsets<br>
20 and 30. The location module 75 may also perform the function of identifying the<br>
location of a handset using triangulation techniques in combination with information from<br>
base stations such as base stations 40 and 50. The location module 75 may also use<br>
global positioning system ("GPS") information from a handset to track the location of a<br>
handset.<br>
The location server 70 and the location module 75 may also receive and route<br>
location requests to and from handsets and other devices (not shown) that are capable of<br>
communicating with the server 70 via the network 60 or any other network that the server<br>
70 may be connected to. For example, the server 70 may also be connected to the<br>
Internet, through network 60 or otherwise, such that device capable of communicating<br>
with the server 70 via the Internet can request the location of handsets from the server<br>
70.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example network 60 that is part of a<br>
system for locating a mobile phone user according to an embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention, in the illustrated embodiment, the network 60 comprises a service provider<br>
network 100 and an other carrier network 110. Additional data or voice networks (not<br>
shown) may also be part of the network 60.<br>
In one embodiment, handset 20 may request the location of handset 30 via<br>
network 60. Such a request may travel from the service provider network 100 that<br>
handset 20 is connected to and be passed over to the other carrier network 110 that<br>
handset 30 is connected to. The location response from handset 30 would in turn travel<br>
over other carrier network 110 and service provider network 100 to reach handset 20.<br>
Figures 3 through 7 are block diagrams illustrating an example sequence of<br>
screen shots on a wireless communication device for locating a mobile phone user<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, in Figure 3, a user selects<br>
a particular contact from the contact list in the handset and requests to see the "details"<br>
for that contact. Advantageously, all contact list entries in the handset include a<br>
LOCATION field that describes where the contact is (or more precisely, where the<br>
handset for the particular contact is).<br>
In one embodiment, the LOCATION field may be initially blank or populated with<br>
default or more general location information such as a large city or metropolitan area. As<br>
shown in Figure 4, the LOCATION field initially says that the location for the contact is<br>
San Diego. Next, as shown in Figure 5, if the user selects the LOCATION field and<br>
chooses options, one option is to view the location of the contact. If the user elects to<br>
view the location, then as shown in Figure 6A, a more granular text based description of<br>
the location for the contact is displayed. This more granular description may be acquired<br>
by the location module on the handset sending a location request to the network and<br>
receiving a response from the location server or directly from the target handset of the<br>
contact.<br>
In certain embodiments, the contact record may not have a LOCATION field but<br>
rather the ADDRESS field may be used to dynamically provide the location for the<br>
contact. In another embodiment, the location for the contact may be dynamically<br>
obtained in real time and displayed to the user. For example, the user may request,<br>
through an "options" menu or other interface, the location for the contact. Upon receipt of<br>
the request, the handset may then request and display the current location for the<br>
contact.<br><br>
In some cases, as shown in Figure 6B, a more granular location may be provided<br>
in graphical format with the display of a portion of a map that identifies the location of the<br>
handset. The map image may be returned to the requesting handset in response to the<br>
location request. The map image that is returned may come from the location server on<br>
the network or from the target handset of the contact.<br>
For example, a target handset may store a map image of its location and send the<br>
map image in response to a location request. In some cases, the map image may be<br>
stored on a location server and be sent as part of a response to a location request.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the user of the requesting handset can save a location for a<br>
target handset. The location may be saved on the network (e.g., at a location server) or<br>
in the data storage area of the requesting handset. The location that is saved may be in<br>
text form or graphical form. Advantageously, a saved location may be used by the<br>
handset as a spoofed or alternate location as will be described in more detail below. In<br>
some cases, a saved location may be used to update the ADDRESS field in the contact<br>
record with text or graphical information.<br>
Figures 8 through 10 are block diagrams illustrating an example sequence of<br>
screen shots on a wireless communication device for setting a locating for a mobile<br>
phone user according to an embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment,<br>
the screen shots illustrate the interaction of a user with the location module on the<br>
handset. The location module allows the user to set operational preferences such as<br>
whether to allow location requests, whether the network (e.g., location server) should<br>
response to location requests on behalf of the handset, whether the actual location<br>
should be provided in response to locations requests or whether a default location for the<br>
handset (regardless of the actual location).<br>
For example, Figure 8 shows an example screen shot for setting the location<br>
permissions on the handset. The user has the option of allowing all location requests or<br>
denying all location requests. Additionally, the user has the option of allowing location<br>
requests received from requesters that have a contact entry in the contacts list of the<br>
handset The user also has the option of being prompted in real time for a decision of<br>
whether to allow or deny the request. Other options can also be made available to the<br>
user of the handset, for example allowing requests by area code or by selective<br><br>
identification based on groups in the contact list. Other options can also be employed as<br>
will be understood by those having skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
Figure 9 shows an example screen shot for setting the operational parameters<br>
regarding the type of location information that is provided in response to a location<br>
request. In the illustrated embodiment, the user can select to provide the actual location<br>
of the handset, as determined, for example by GPS or triangulation. The user also has<br>
the ability to select that an alternate or spoofed or default location be sent in response to<br>
a location request. For example a user may select to have all responses to location<br>
requests send the users work location (in text or graphical format) in response through<br>
whether the user is actually at that location or not. Moreover, the user has the option of<br>
having the network respond to location requests.<br>
For example, the handset may be periodically obtaining GPS information from a<br>
GPS module on the handset and then providing that information to the network where it is<br>
tracked by a location server. If the user selects to have the network respond to location<br>
requests, then the handset may not even receive the location request and instead the<br>
network location server receives the request and responds to the request with the<br>
location information (text or graphical) based on the GPS information being periodically<br>
provided to the network. This same process may also be used in triangulation or other<br>
techniques used by the handset or network to identify the location of the handset.<br>
Figure 10 shows an example screen shot for setting the operational parameter of<br>
an alternate location that should be reported in response to location requests.<br>
Advantageously, saved locations can be selected as an alternate location and the text or<br>
graphical location information stored on the handset or network is then provided in<br>
response to location requests.<br>
Figure 11 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for locating a mobile<br>
phone user according to an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, in step 200 the<br>
handset receives a number for the mobile phone (target handset) that is to be located.<br>
The number may be received through direct entry (e.g., by a user typing in the number on<br>
the keypad of the handset) or by indirect entry (e.g., received via SMS, email, instant<br>
message, or other). Additionally, the number may be received via selection of a<br>
particular contact in the contacts list.<br><br>
Next, in step 205 the handset requests the location of the target handset from the<br>
network. The request may be sent to a location server on the network or may be routed<br>
directly to the target handset by the network. In one embodiment, this routing may be<br>
determined by operational parameters that are set on the target handset. In some cases,<br>
the network may establish the routing procedure.<br>
After requesting the location from the network, the handset, in step 210, receives a<br>
response from the network that includes the location of the target handset. The location<br>
is then displayed, as shown in step 215. The display of the location can be integrated<br>
with a display of other contact information for the target handset.<br>
In one embodiment, when contact information is first requested such as shown in<br>
Figure 3, the handset may request macro or general location information from the<br>
network. For example, if the LOCATION field is not populated when the user requests<br>
contact information, the handset may use the process outlined in Figure 11 to obtain<br>
general location information. This information may be provided by the network based on<br>
the last known location for the target handset, which may be, for example, determined by<br>
the location of the base station with which the target handset was last in contact. In this<br>
way, a general location such as a city or state may be initially provided to provide the<br>
LOCATION field for display of the contact information.<br>
Figure 12 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for periodic real time<br>
updating of the location of a mobile phone user according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Initially, in step 250, the contact entry for real-time updating is<br>
identified. In one embodiment, the identification may be provided by the user interacting<br>
with the location module through the contact list or settings menus such as those<br>
described with respect to Figures 3 through 10. Alternatively, or in combination, the<br>
location module can cycle through a list of contacts that are flagged for real time updating<br>
and identify each contact that needs to be updated.<br>
Next, in step 255 the handset requests the location of the target handset from the<br>
network and receives the location information in step 260. Upon receiving the location<br>
information, the LOCATION field in the contact entry is updated. This process can also<br>
be used in combination with the process described with respect to Figure 11. In such an<br>
embodiment, for example, the initial general location may be provided by use of the real<br><br>
time updating and then when the user requests more detailed location information, a<br>
request for the more detailed location information can be sent to the network.<br>
Figure 13 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for responding to a<br>
request for the location of a target handset according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Initially, in step 300, the target handset receives the location request. Next, in<br>
step 305 the target handset parses the request to identify the requesting handset. For<br>
example, the target handset may parse the request to identify the mobile identification<br>
number ("MIN") of the requesting handset. In one embodiment, the MIN may be the<br>
telephone number of the requesting handset.<br>
Next, in step 310, the target handset determines if the identified requesting<br>
handset is valid. For example, in one embodiment, only those requesting handsets with<br>
entries in the contact list of the target handset are valid, as previously explained with<br>
respect to the permissions settings in Figure 8. If the requesting handset is not valid, as<br>
determined in step 310, then the target handset denies the request, as shown in step<br>
315. If the requesting handset is valid, as determined in step 310, then the target<br>
handset obtains its location, as illustrated in step 320.<br>
In one embodiment, the target handset may obtain its location from the network by<br>
a separate request, for example, or the target handset may obtain its location via an<br>
integral GPS module, or some combination of network and integral services and<br>
modules. In some cases, the target handset may obtain its location from memory on the<br>
handset, for example when the user of the target handset has selected that a default<br>
location be provided in response to location requests, notwithstanding the actual location<br>
of the handset Once the location has been obtained, the location information is sent in<br>
reply to the location request, as shown in step 325.<br>
Figure 14 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process for locating a target<br>
handset according to an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, in step 350 the<br>
network receives a location request from a requesting handset. In one embodiment, a<br>
location server such as that described in Figure 1 on the network may receive and<br>
process the location request. Upon receipt of the location request the network<br>
determines, in step 355, if the number for the target handset is a subscriber number on<br>
the carrier's network. If the number is not that of a subscriber, then the network<br><br>
determines the appropriate carrier for the requested number and forwards the location<br>
request to that network, as shown in step 360.<br>
If the number is a subscriber or if a different carrier network processes the request<br>
(e.g., via step 360), in step 360 the network determines if the location service is available<br>
for the particular handset for which the location has been requested. If the service is not<br>
available, then in step 370 the request is denied. If the service is available, the network<br>
determines, in step 375, if the network is authorized to respond to the request on behalf<br>
of the handset. For example, in an embodiment where the target handset is a wired<br>
device, the location of the device may be configured by the user when the device was<br>
initially setup or periodically thereafter. If the network is authorized to respond to the<br>
request on behalf of the handset, then in step 380 the network sends the location<br>
information. For example, the network may send the general location information in<br>
response to a general location request or the network may send a specific location in<br>
response to a specific location request. The response may also be text based or may<br>
include a graphical component such as a map of the general or specific location of the<br>
target handset.<br>
If the network is not authorized to respond on behalf of the target handset, as<br>
determined in step 375, then the network sends the location request to the target handset<br>
in step 385. The target handset may then process the request, for example as previously<br>
described with respect to Figure 13, and then in step 390 the network receives a<br>
response from the target handset. Next, in step 395, the network sends a reply to the<br>
requesting handset, in one embodiment, the reply sent by the network to the requesting<br>
handset may include information received from the target handset and also additional<br>
information. For example, the target handset may respond with a default location that<br>
includes graphical map data (e.g., a JPEG image) that is stored on a location server on<br>
the network. Accordingly, the response from the network to the requesting handset can<br>
include both the default location information received from the target handset and the<br>
corresponding map image stored on the location server.<br>
Figure 15 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary wireless communication<br>
device 450 that may be used in connection with the various embodiments described<br>
herein. For example, the wireless communication device 450 may be used in conjunction<br>
with a handset as described above with respect to Figure 1. However, other wireless<br><br>
communication devices and/or architectures may also be used, as will be clear to those<br>

In the illustrated embodiment, wireless communication device 450 comprises an<br>
antenna 452, a multiplexor 454, a low noise amplifier ("LNA") 456, a power amplifier<br>
("PA") 458, a modulation circuit 460, a baseband processor 462, a speaker 464, a<br>
microphone 466, a central processing unit ("CPU") 468, a data storage area 470, and a<br>
hardware interface 472. In the wireless communication device 450, radio frequency<br>
("RF") signals are transmitted and received by antenna 452. Multiplexor 454 acts as a<br>
switch, coupling antenna 452 between transmit and receive signal paths. In the receive<br>
path, received RF signals are coupled from a multiplexor 454 to LNA 456. LNA 456<br>
amplifies the received RF signal and couples the amplified signal to a demodulation<br>
portion of the modulation circuit 460.<br>
Typically modulation circuit 460 will combine a demodulator and modulator in one<br>
integrated circuit ("IC"). The demodulator and modulator can also be separate<br>
components. The demodulator strips away the RF carrier signal leaving a base-band<br>
receive audio signal, which is sent from the demodulator output to the base-band<br>
processor 462.<br>
If the base-band receive audio signal contains audio information, then base-band<br>
processor 462 decodes the signal and converts it to an analog signal. Then the signal is<br>
amplified and sent to the speaker 464. The base-band processor 462 also receives<br>
analog audio signals from the microphone 466. These analog audio signals are<br>
converted to digital signals and encoded by the base-band processor 462. The baseband<br>
processor 462 also codes the digital signals for transmission and generates a baseband<br>
transmit audio signal that is routed to the modulator portion of modulation circuit<br>
460. The modulator mixes the base-band transmit audio signal with an RF carrier signal<br>
generating an RF transmit signal that is routed to the power amplifier 458. The power<br>
amplifier 458 amplifies the RF transmit signal and routes it to the multiplexor 454 where<br>
the signal is switched to the antenna port for transmission by antenna 452.<br>
The baseband processor 462 is also communicatively coupled with the central<br>
processing unit 468. The central processing unit 468 has access to a data storage area<br>
470. The central processing unit 468 is preferably configured to execute instructions (i.e.,<br>
computer programs or software) that can be stored in the data storage area 470.<br><br>
Computer programs can also be received from the baseband processor 462 and stored<br>
in the data storage area 470 or executed upon receipt. Such computer programs, when<br>
executed, enable the wireless communication device 450 to perform the various functions<br>
of the present invention as previously described.<br>
For example, data storage area 470 may include a location module (not shown)<br>
that integrates with the operating system or module that controls the operation of the<br>
contact list. Accordingly, the location module may extend the functionality of the contact<br>
list to include the LOCATION field and the ability for a user to set the operational<br>
parameter preferences. Additionally, the location module is configured to respond to<br>
location requests in accordance with the operational parameter preferences that have<br>
been set by the user.<br>
In this description, the term "computer readable medium" is used to refer to any<br>
media used to provide executable instructions (e.g., software and computer programs) to<br>
the wireless communication device 450 for execution by the central processing unit 468.<br>
Examples of these media include the data storage area 470, microphone 466 (via the<br>
baseband processor 462), antenna 452 (also via the baseband processor 462), and<br>
hardware interface 472. These computer readable mediums are means for providing<br>
executable code, programming instructions, and software to the wireless communication<br>
device 450. The executable code, programming instructions, and software, when<br>
executed by the central processing unit 468, preferably cause the central processing unit<br>
468 to perform the inventive features and functions previously described herein.<br>
The central processing unit is also preferably configured to receive notifications<br>
from the hardware interface 472 when new devices are detected by the hardware<br>
interface. Hardware interface 472 can be a combination electromechanical detector with<br>
controlling software that communicates with the CPU 468 and interacts with new devices.<br>
Furthermore, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the various illustrative<br>
logical blocks, modules, circuits, and method steps described in connection with the<br>
above described figures and the embodiments disclosed herein can often be<br>
implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both. To<br>
clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software, various illustrative<br>
components, blocks, modules, circuits, and steps have been described above generally<br>
in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or<br><br>
software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the<br>
overall system. Skilled persons can implement the described functionality in varying<br>
ways for each particular application, but such implementation decisions should not be<br>
interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the invention. In addition, the<br>
grouping of functions within a module, block, circuit or step is for ease of description.<br>
Specific functions or steps can be moved from one module, block or circuit to another<br>
without departing from the invention.<br>
Moreover, the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, and methods described<br>

components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described<br>
herein. A general-purpose processor can be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the<br>
processor can be any processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A<br>
processor can also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, for example,<br>
a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or<br>
more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.<br>
Additionally, the steps of a method or algorithm described in connection with the<br>
embodiments disclosed herein can be embodied directly in hardware, in a software<br>
