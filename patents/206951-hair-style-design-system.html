specification HAIR DESIGN SYSTEM AND ITS APPLICATIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a hairstyle design system, specifically a hairstyle design system that utilizes a computer-based image-processing system for the design of hairstyles and the display of hairstyle images for assistance in the beautician's creative process. The invention also relates to the use of the hairstyle design system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is said that hairstyling using permanent wave and other techniques is as important to the modem woman as her livelihood. The woman considers a hairstyle, achieved througji various types of processing such as cutting, permanent waving and coloring, as an important element in the creation of a favorable impression. In other words, a desired hairstyle is achieved through a combination of permanent waving, cutting and blow-drying. However, since it is difficult for most women to design the desired hairstyles on their own, they are actually unable to direct their beauticians to ensure that their hair is styled according to what is desired.<br>
Conventionally, the woman customer at a beauty salon determines her favorite types of cutting, coloring and peraianent waving by referring to hairstyle models (images of hairstyle samples), hairstyle designs featured in magazines, the beautician's advice and so forth. The customer then verbally places her order with the beautician, who in turn processes the customer's hair according to the requested hairstyle. Alternatively, the beautician may process the customer's hair according to what the beautician recalls the customer's customary, desired hairstyle to have been. Another alternative is to leave the entire process up to the beautician. Evidently, due to the absence of accurate documentation on the customer's favorite mode of hair processing, much of it depends on the beautician's sensitivity and skill. Cutting, coloring, permanent waving and the like are normally employed at the discretion of the beautician.<br>
Adult hair strands range in diameter from 0.09 to 0.5 mm, on the average. Anywhere from 100,000 to 150,000 strands of hair, grown to approximately 50 percent, cover the head despite the natural process of hair loss (50 to 100 strands per day). A hair grows about 1.1 to<br><br>
1.3 cm over a period of a month, necessitating cutting and permanent waving once every four to five weeks, although requirements vary among individuals. The woman customer orders her desired hairstyle each time she visits a beauty salon for a haircut and permanent wave. It isn't at all rare that the customer will feel dissatisfied with some imperfect conformance of the finished hairstyle to the one she desired, although the beautician's skills are a factor in that. For this reason the customer tends to return to the same salon, and the salon assigns the same beautician to that customer each time she returns. Still, it is difficult to process customers' hairstyles exactly as they want, given the infinite variations in hairstyle requests. Even if the beautician achieves the customer's favorite hairstyle once, it is virtually impossible to get the same result at the next permanent-wave session.<br>
Hairstyling includes hair setting with curlers and blow-styling using instruments such as a dryer and brush. The process of hair setting normally involves rolling strands of hair around curlers and then drying, followed by setting the entire hairstyle. Blow-styling normally consists of dividing the head of hair into several parts and drying individual parts separately, in sequence, with a dryer in order to achieve a final, overall style. In the conventional method of hairstyling, the customer gradually arrives at a final hairstyle that would best suit her by referring to a photograph of a desired hairstyle sample pasted to the mirror while consulting with the beautician. Examples of this method are disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-open Nos. 58-48180, 59-98821, 59-98822, 60-64722 and 5-91519. However, it is still difficult to style each customer's hair exactly as desired by the customer and to reproduce the ideal hairstyle, given the unique characteristics of each customer's head and face. Three-dimensional head models with simulated strands of synthetic fiber or animal or human hair planted thereon have been used but never for the purpose of reproducing a given hairstyle.<br>
Publicly knoAvn methods have existed for the design of a customer's desired hairstyle, wherein the desired hairstyle is designed through constant reference to a hairstyle model and using a predicted hairstyle pattern for the customer displayed on a TV monitor or computer. Examples of such methods are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 58-97306, 56-109616, 60-45303, 7-67721, 9-98834 and 10-14655. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to achieve a hairstyle precisely as desired by any one customer simply by applying the displayed three-dimensional visual information to the hairstyling process, given that the head<br><br>
and facial shapes vary from one customer to the next.<br>
To solve the foregoing problems, the inventor of the present invention proposed a hairstylihg method based on the use of numerals and/or symbols in Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-001315. That invention aims to design a hairstyle precisely as desired by the customer, and to fully implement and reproduce the hairstyling process in accordance with the desired hairstyle. Accordingly, the desired hairstyle is translated into numerals and/or symbols. Those numerals and/or symbols are then entered on a prescribed "head-development drawing" to finalize the hairstyle. The hair is then styled with reference to the drawing.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The aforementioned existing method, however, had problems in that it required not only that the numerical and/or symbolic representation of a hairstyle be entered into a head-development drawing, but also the time needed to train the operator in the use of the system, thereby rendering the method inefficient.<br>
The present invention herem described aims to offer a hairstyle design system through a simple configuration that will solve the aforementioned problems, and that will allow the design and standardization of hairstyles precisely as desired by beauty-salon customers, and that will facilitate the achievement of a hairstyle exactly as was previously designed.<br>
To solve the aforementioned problems, the hairstyle design system of the present invention is configured to comprise: an input/output device with which to input instructions to select or process images and to output status information; a graphic system that converts image information into image data for display; a display device for the display of head image data, as converted by the graphic system, and a head-development drawing a head-development drawing information-storage device that stores hairstyle design data entered as niraierals and/or symbols representing hair length and color and the type of permanent wave to be used for each part of the head; a hairstyle-design information-storage device that stores a plurality of hairstyle-model data sets which serve as samples for hairstyle design; and an image-processing device that outputs to the graphic system a synthesized or modified image based on the hairstyle design data, as retrieved from the head-development drawing information-storage device and the hairstyle-design information-storage device on instructions from the input/output device, and which writes the resultant processed hairstyle design data into the<br><br>
head-development drawing information-storage device and the hairstyle-design information-storage device.<br>
The present invention also comprises the following configuration:<br>
(1)	A hairstyle design method whereby the customer and/or a third party determines a hairstyle as designed through the aforementioned hairstyle design system;<br>
(2)	A hair-processing method whereby the beautician processes hair by reproducing on a display device the electronic information obtained through the aforementioned hairstyle design system; and<br>
(3)	A hair-processing method whereby the beautician processes hair by referring to a head-development drawing on which numerals and/or symbols are entered for each of a plurality of divided sections, said numerals and/or symbols corresponding to a hairstyle design output based on the electronic information obtained through the aforementioned hairstyle design sytem.<br>
The configuration allows a hairstyle to be designed precisely as desired by the customer, in turn making it possible for the customer's desired hair design to be achieved using the exact method of hair processing needed to ensure that goal.<br>
The present invention is also capable of ensuring repeated and consistent hair processing, thereby meeting the beauty and haircutting needs of large numbers of people. It is highly useful in the industry and is of significant service to society.<br>

An explanation follows on the workings of the hairstyle design system in the embodiment of the present invention, as described in the foregoing.<br>
First, the method for determining a hairstyle design is described. The hairstyle design system utilizes a computer-based image-processing/design system (CAD or CAM system), as used widely in industry, for the purpose of designing a hairstyle. The beautician designs the hairstyle as desired by the customer while looking at the display device 4. The customer may also design the hairstyle of her choice in the manner of playing a computer game.<br>
Large numbers of total-head and partial-head hairstyle models are stored in the hairstyle-design information-storage device 6. A hairstyle model is the prototype information for a given hairstyle, comprising a set of data on head shape, hair color, hair length, and the type of permanent wave used for each part of the head.<br>
To design a hairstyle as desired by a customer, the beautician operates the input/output device 2 to display a plurality of total-head hairstyle models at a time on the display device 4. Specifically, in the image-processing device 1, images of hairstyle models retrieved from the hairstyle-design information-storage device 6 are synthesized, whereupon the graphic system 3 converts the images into image data, which in tum is displayed on the display device 4. The beautician uses a mouse to select a desired hairstyle model to serve as the basic hairstyle model. The hairstyle model may be rotated freely on the display device 4.<br>
It is possible to point to any part of the basic hairstyle model using a mouse in order to modify the part. Specifically, the beautician may retrieve and display partial-head hairstyle models from the hairstyle-design information-storage device 6, select a desired partial-head hairstyle model, and paste it onto the basic hairstyle model. The beautician may also select a color and hair length with which to modify a designated part of the basic hairstyle model. It is also possible to display a head-development drawing and directly replace, as desired, any<br><br>
existing numerals and/or symbols previously assigned thereinVThe beautician repeatedly alters a hairstyle model until the head image on the display device 4 becomes the desired hairstyle. All of the image-processing functions, as referred to in the foregoing, can be accomplished using publicly known CAD/CAM systems. When a hairstyle is finally determined, the information on the modified version of the basic hairstyle model is stored as development-drawing information in the head-development drawing information-storage device 5. The design information on the hairstyle, as designed by the customer, is also stored in the hairstyle-design information-storage device 6.<br>
The numerals and/or symbols, assigned to the sections shown in the foregoing head-development drawing, represent the hair length, type of permanent wave and color for the final hairstyle design. In the haircutting process, the numerals and/or symbols, as output from a displayed hairstyle model, represent the length of hair from the root. A numeral may represent the length in millimeters or centimeters, or a symbol may mark the hair as being long or short. In the hair-coloring process, the assigned numerals and/or symbols are used to express the color. In a permanent-wave or other hair-shaping process, numerals and/or symbols are used to represent a type of wave or ironing. Information relative to haircutting, coloring, type of permanent wave and other processes is converted into numerals and/or symbols for each part of the head-development drawing, being the major sections or subsections, and is then stored as magnetic information, thus facilitating the achievement of an ideal hairstyling process as desired by the customer and the precise reproduction of a desired hairstyle.<br>
Secondly, the method of dividing the head into sections is described. A head-development drawing shows the surface of the head divided into a plurality of major sections and numerous subsections. The plurality of major sections, as shown in a head-development drawing, are defined by dividing the head into two along the centerline of the head, these sections being further divided into the top front, back, top side, underside and nape sections. The plurality of major sections in the head-development drawing represent the front, top, side and back sections of the head, respectively. The numerous sections in the head-development drawing are subsections as defined by subdividing the major sections into an appropriate number of smaller sections. The number of subsections in a head-development drawing may range approximately between 10 and 160. Each head-development drawing is modified to suit an individual customer.<br><br>
The major sections in the head-development drawing may be in whatever number is most appropriate for a particular customer. Examples of such an appropriate number are a total of 10 sections consisting of the front top, back, top side, underside and nape sections on both the left- and right-hand sides of the centerline of the head; or a total of four sections consisting of the front, top, side and back sections. The subsections, as defined by subdividing the major sections, may be in any suitable number. An appropriate number may range approximately between 10 and 160, but preferably between 60 and 80. Given the unique characteristics of each customer's head and face, the number of subsections may be set in advance for a particular customer and the resultant head-development drawing may be stored in memory for a better-fitting hairstyle design on the customer's behalf.<br>
Thirdly, the hair-processing method is described. When the beautician processes a customer's hair, the head-development drawing data—which includes the numerals and/or symbols representing a hairstyle—is retrieved from the head-development drawing information-storage device 5, whereupon the graphic system 3 converts the data into image data for a development drawing, which in tum is output to a monitor on the display device 4. The data is output as a development drawing in which specific items for the determined hairstyle design are entered for the divided sections of the head. Specifically, the displayed head-development draAving shows the numerals and/or symbols entered therein to represent information such as hair length, the length to be cut, type of permanent wave and type of coloring for the determined hairstyle design. The beautician cuts, colors and applies permanent waving to the hair in accordance with the numerals and/or symbols entered in the head-development drawing. The beautician may display a total-head image or partial-head image of the hairstyle on the display device 4 in order to check on the progress of hair processing. In other words, when processing hair the beautician retrieves the design information for the hairstyle of the customer's design from the hairstyle-design information-storage device 6, and reproduces it as a head image on the display device 4 for reference in processing the hair.<br>
Obviously it is possible to process hair by referring to the head images only. However, in practice it is difficult for the beautician to process hair in perfect conformance to the customer-designed hairstyle by referring solely to the hairstyle in the head image shown on the display device 4. It is more suitable to process hair primarily according to a development drawing while using the head image as a supplement<br><br>
The customer's desired hairstyle is stored in a recording medium so that it can be reproduced on the display device 4 at any time. The beautician may also use a customer's hairstyle as a basic design and modify it to suit the customer's wishes. It also follows that a customer may refer to the head image of her existing design and modify it through consultation with the beautician.<br>
The head-development drawings to be output on the display device 4 are shown in FIGS. 5, 6,10 and 11. To illustrate an example, the head-development drawing in FIG. 6 shows a development drawing containing a total of eight sections as defined by dividing four sections—the top front (TF), top side (TS), underside (US) and nape (NA) sections as shown in FIGS. 2 through 5—along the centerline of the head, onto which numerals and/or symbols representing the determined hairstyle design are entered. The eight sections (4 x 2) are subdivided into unit sections, one unit being considered a section. The sections are sequentially numbered 1 through n to identify their respective locations.<br>
An example of a division scheme is to set up 38 sections per side—eight top front (TF), eight top side (TS), 16 underside (US) and six nape (NA) sections—or a total of 76 sections (38 x 2) on both the left- and right-hand sides of the centerline of the head. In this division scheme, "LTS5," for example, denotes the fifth section from the top in the left top-side area, on the left-hand side of the back centerline, in the left top side section (LTS) on the left-hand side (from the back) of the head shown in FIG. 9.<br>
Yet another division scheme, which uses no centerline through the head but divides the entire head starting at the front of the head, may be more appropriate for certain hairstyles, In this scheme, as shown in FIGS. 7 through 9, the major sections would consist of seven sections, namely the front, top, back center, side left, back left, side right and back right, which may in turn be subdivided to define smaller sections.<br>
For example, the head-development drawings shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 include four<br><br>
sections for the front (F), four for the top (T), 16 for the back center (BC), eight each for the<br>
side left (SL) and side right (SR), and 12 each for the back left (BL) and back right (BR). In<br>
this scheme, when referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, "BL3" denotes the third section from the top<br>
in the back left (BL) section. The number of sections is determined according to the customer's<br>
head and facial shape.<br><br>
The use of image processing in the creation of a desired hairstyle image thus allows the design of a desired hairstyle in minute detail. A hairstyle may also be presented in a two-dimensional development drawing, with numerals and/or symbols entered therein, to enable the beautician to cut, color and apply permanent wave to the hair as desired by the customer.<br>
Since hairstyles are designed based on the head-development drawing, hairstyles and hairstyling prescriptions can be standardized and then easily integrated and interchanged with one another. Customer preferences may be exchanged between different beauty salons over the Internet or other means, enabling the reproduction of the same hairstyle design by different beauticians or even at different beauty salons through the use of head-development drawings or hairstyle unages.<br>
As shown in the foregoing, the hairstyle design system in the embodiment of the present invention is configured in such a way that a computer-based graphic-processing system is used to facilitate the design of a hairstyle while looking at a display device, and when the beautician processes hair, a head-development drawing is output wherein numerals and/or symbols are entered for each of a plurality of divided sections. This configuration enables the design of a hairstyle as desired by the customer and the processing of hair according to the hairstyle thus created.<br>
Industrial Field of Application<br>
As may be evident from the foregoing explanations, the hairstyle design system of the present invention is configured to comprise: an input/output device with which to input instructions to select or process images and to output status information; a graphic system that converts image information into image data for display; a display device for the display of head image data, as converted by the graphic system, and a head-development drawing; a head-development drawing information-storage device that stores hairstyle design data entered as numerals and/or symbols representing hair length and color and the type of permanent wave to be used for each part of the head; a hairstyle-design information-storage device that stores a plurality of hairstyle-model data sets which serve as samples for hairstyle design; and an image-processing device that outputs to the graphic system a synthesized or modified image based on the hairstyle design data, as retrieved from the head-development drawing information-storage device and the hairstyle-design information-storage device on instructions<br><br>
from the input/output device, and which writes the resultant processed hairstyle design data into the head-development drawing information-storage device and the hairstyle-design information-storage device; thereby providing the effect of enabling the design of a hairstyle precisely as desired by the customer, the processing of hair to accurately reproduce a predetermined hairstyle, and the standardization and exchange of hairstyle design information.<br><br><br><br>
