				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an axial piston compressor used in the automobile<br>
industry to generate compressed air for a variety of accessories employed in a<br>
motor vehicle. Particularly, the invention relates to a variable displacement<br>
swash-plate air compressor installed on a vehicle and having pistons the motion<br>
of which is predicated on displacement of a swash plate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A swash-plate axial piston compressor is disclosed on U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,463 to<br>
Kimura et al. Typically used as air-conditioning compressors, this type of<br>
compressor is known for its complicated mechanical construction which includes<br>
at least one movable piston in a cylinder block. The piston conveys the air to be<br>
compressed from an intake region into a compression region. The reciprocating<br>
action of the piston is effected by a swash plate, which is rotatably mounted on i<br>
rotating shaft.<br>
The swash plates acts in conjunction with a take-up plate linked to at least one<br>
piston, the plate being positioned in the compressor housing such that it cannot<br>
rotate and is supported on a non-rotatable thrust bearing. The purpose of the<br>
thrust bearing is to take up the torque that is transmitted from the rotating<br>
swash plate to the take-up plate. Compressors of this type are of complex<br>
construction in the regions of swash and take-up plates, involving a large<br>
number of parts. Furthermore, the discussed compressors require a relatively<br>
large space.<br>
Another construction of the swash-plate axial piston type compressor includes a<br>
rotatable cylinder block and a stationary swash plate and is disclosed for example<br>
in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,698 to Takagi et al. This structure is also structurally<br>
complex and in addition tends to permit oil leakage into the air stream.<br>
A variable capacity wobble plate type compressor provided with a reciprocatory<br>
piston mechanism for compressing a refrigerant gas and discharging the<br>
compressed refrigerant gas, a drive shaft driven by an external drive source to<br>
allow an assembly of angularly variable drive and wobble plates to reciprocate<br>
the reciprocatory piston mechanism, a coil spring mounted on the drive shaft for<br>
applying a biasing force to the assembly of drive and wobble plates toward a<br>
predetermined angularly inclined position, and annular spring support members<br>
for supporting the opposite ends of the coil spring so that the coil spring is not in<br>
contact with the outer surface of the drive shaft, to thereby prevent an abrasion<br>
of the coil spring and the drive shaft when the coil spring is contracted and<br>
expanded during the operation of the compressor.<br>
It is, therefore, desirable to provide a variable displacement swash-plate air<br>
compressor with stationary bores receiving pistons. Also, it is desirable to provide<br>
an axial piston compressor wherein an assembly for displacing a swash plate is<br>
compact and structurally simple. Furthermore, a variable swash-plate air<br>
compressor having pistons the reciprocal motion of which is predicated on<br>
displacement of a swash plate is also desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, a swash plate of an axial piston compressor<br>
moves between a neutral position, wherein forces from the air pressure inside<br>
the cylinders and a movable cam acting in opposite directions upon the plate are<br>
counterbalanced to cease compression of compressed air, and a second<br>
pressurizing position, with the preloading selected at a level below which the afr<br>
pressure needs to be increased.<br>
Accordingly, the inventive axial piston compressor has a displaceable actuator,<br>
which exerts a thrust upon a swash plate to displace pistons in stationary bores<br>
of the cylinders. The compressor ceases air-compression when a thrust exerted<br>
by an actuator upon the swash plate counterbalances a force generated by<br>
pistons upon the swash plate. Thus, the compressor experiences a state of<br>
pressure equilibrium, wherein the swash plate lies in a plane extending<br>
perpendicular to a shaft supporting the swash plate, and the pistons are idle.<br>
The force generated by the pistons is a result of air pressure above the pistons in<br>
the stationary cylinder block which is in flow communication with an air system<br>
of a motor vehicle, including, but not limited to, a heavy-duty truck.<br>
The compressor is in a working state characterized by reciprocal motion of the<br>
pistons after the actuator controllably moves towards and pivots the swash plate<br>
in response to a pressure drop in the cylinder block below the thrust generated<br>
by the actuator in the state of equilibrium.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the actuator includes a plurality<br>
of resilient elements attached to a cam element which is in contact with the<br>
swash plate. The resilient elements are able to expand at a distance toward the<br>
swash plate in response to a pressure drop in the air system of the vehicle which<br>
causes the pressure in the space above the pistons to decrease below the thrust<br>
generated by the resilient elements. Pistons1 strokes are controlled by an angle<br>
at which the swash plate deflects from its vertical or neutral position by a thrust<br>
generated by the cam, which is displaced by the expanded washers as the<br>
pressure in the air system drops to or below a reference value that is equal to a<br>
force generated by the washers in the neutral state of the plate. The swash plate<br>
will shift back to the neutral position, wherein the pistons are neutralized, thus<br>
discontinuing air production upon reaching the state of equilibrium between the<br>
force generated by the washers and the pressure above the pistons.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the angle at which the<br>
swash plate deflects from its neutral positions is controlled by a servo piston,<br>
which may be mounted in a rotating member of a drive shaft. The servo piston is<br>
attached to a link coupled to a cam element which is displaced toward the plate<br>
at distance corresponding a signal actuating the servo piston and corresponding<br>
to a pressure drop in the air system of the vehicle.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an axial piston compressor<br>
having a swash plate controlling the movement of the pistons, which are<br>
received in stationary cylinder bores.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an axial piston compressor<br>
wherein the angular displacement of the swash plate is controlled in response to<br>
displacement of an actuator after the pressure in an air system of the truck has<br>
fall down to or below a reference value.<br>
Still a further object of the invention is to provide an axial piston compressor<br>
having a resilient actuator which is controllably displaced relative to the swash<br>
plate in order to exert a thrust upon the plate in response to the pressure<br>
change in the air system.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an axial piston compressor wherein<br>
air production is initiated upon disturbing a state of equilibrium, wherein a force<br>
exerted by a controllably displaceable cam element upon a swash plate is<br>
counterbalanced by a pre-set pressure in the air system of the truck.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a variable displacement swash-plate compressor 10<br>
installed on a heavy duty vehicle, such as an over-the road truck, generates<br>
compressed air for the truck's air pressure system which includes a tank 14<br>
supplying the compressed air to various accessories, for example the brake<br>
system. Production of the compressed air begins by taking in air, which may cr<br>
may not be delivered from a turbocharger or through a filter 16, in response to<br>
reduction of the air pressure in the air system to or below a reference pressure,<br>
which may vary from 10 Bar for North America to 13 Bar for Europe.<br>
To provide the compressed air, the compressor 10 has a stationary cylinder block<br>
22 including a plurality of bores 23 which receive pistons 24 reciprocally<br>
displaceable within the bores to have suction and compression strokes. A space<br>
in cylinder bores above the pistons is in flow communication with the air system<br>
through a plurality of discharge ports 20. Accordingly, the air pressure in this<br>
space corresponds to air pressure in the air system in a state of pressure<br>
equilibrium of the compressor, as is explained below.<br>
The pistons are idle in the state of pressure equilibrium wherein a piston-<br>
generated force acting upon a swash plate assembly 34 and corresponding to<br>
the air pressure in the space above the pistons is equal and oppositely directed<br>
to a thrust generated by an actuating assembly 41 against this plate assembly.<br>
The state of equilibrium is characterized by a substantially perpendicular position<br>
of the swash plate assembly with respect to an axis of a rotating shaft 12. Once<br>
the balance of air pressure has been disturbed, the thrust from the actuating<br>
assembly exceeds the lowered piston-generated force to angularly displace the<br>
swash plate assembly from its perpendicular position. As a result, the pistons<br>
begin to reciprocally move in the stationary bores, as will be explained in detail<br>
hereinbelow. Thus, the more the air pressure in the air system drops, the larger<br>
the angular displacement of the swash plate is and the longer the pistons'<br>
strokes are.<br>
To provide flow communication between the intake and discharge ports 18, 20,<br>
the compressor has a head plate 26, as better illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, which<br>
is provided with a plurality of check valves 28 preventing the back feeding of the<br>
air discharge. Preferably, the check valves may be of reed or poppet types<br>
allowing air to flow along a path from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure<br>
area. Thus, as the pressure in the air system downstream from the compressor<br>
lowers, airflow is directed from the bores to the air system through the valve 28<br>
provided in the discharge port 20. Accordingly, air pressure above the pistons is<br>
lowered causing thus displacement of the actuating assembly 41, the swash<br>
plate and the pistons. As a result, the suction stroke generates a negative<br>
pressure sufficient to allow outer air to enter the cylinder block through valves 28<br>
provided in the inlet port 18.<br>
Note, although the pistons' motion is arrested, and, thus, the compressor does<br>
not compress air, the shaft continues to rotate. As a consequence, accessories<br>
coupled to the shaft, such as a fuel pump, continue to function.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the actuating assembly includes<br>
a resilient element, such as Belleville washers 40 and a cam collar 38, as shown<br>
in detail in FIG. 9. The washers are connected to the cam collar 38 having a<br>
slanted cam surface with respect to the shaft, an extended part 66 of which is<br>
always in contact with the swash plate 34. Note, the swash plate is always under<br>
pressure existing above the pistons and thus, to maintain the plate in the vertical<br>
position during the state of equilibrium, the cam collar has to continuously<br>
preload the plate. However, this contact in the state of equilibrium does not<br>
generate a thrust sufficient to overcome the pressure above the pistons and to<br>
pivot the plate about a pin 36 rotatably mounted on the shaft 12.<br>
Although the actuating assembly as shown is rotatably mounted on the shaft 12,<br>
it can be stationary mounted to a housing 62 of the compressor. Further,<br>
different types of compression springs, such as bellows, can be used as<br>
effectively as the above-disclosed washers.<br>
The swash plate assembly 34 is comprised of a rotatable inner part 44 coupled to<br>
the pin 36 to rotate about a shaft axis A-A of the shaft 12, and an outer part 42<br>
better illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 9 and connected to the inner part by means of a<br>
bearing assembly 46. The entire swash plate assembly is pivotal with respect to<br>
the shaft upon a thrust exerted by the cam collar 38 which moves axially along<br>
the shaft in response to the expansion of the Belleville washers as the pressure<br>
in the air system drops to or below the reference value.<br>
A mechanism for translating pivotal displacement of the swash plate (FIG. 4) to<br>
reciprocal axial displacement of the pistons (FIG. 4) includes a plurality of ball<br>
links, each of which is comprised of a ball element 54 and a rod 56. The rods 56,<br>
which are spaced angularly equidistantly from one another along an outer<br>
periphery of the swash plate and extend radially therefrom, can be for example<br>
bolts provided with a thread on one of its ends and with a nut 50 on the opposite<br>
end. The ball 54 has a spherical outer surface slidably engaging a piston rod 30,<br>
which extends parallel to the rotating shaft 12, for synchronous axial<br>
displacement, while allowing the piston rod and ball element to angularly<br>
displace relative to one another.<br>
To displace the pistons and swash plate relative to one another as the swash<br>
plate pivots, each piston rod 30 has a flange 58 the inner surface of which<br>
cooperates with an outer extremity 52 of the ball element, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Accordingly, as the swash plate is angularly displaced to a position shown in FIG.<br>
3, the cooperating surfaces of the flange and ball element slidably move relative<br>
to one another. Such relative displacement allows the piston rod and ball<br>
element 54 to move axially together, while the ball element rotates within the<br>
flange in response to the angular motion of the swash plate. Note that the flange<br>
58 may have its cooperating surface provided with a shape different from an<br>
annular shape as long as these elements move axially synchronously while being<br>
angularly displaceable relative to one another, as shown in FIG. 3 FIG. 3<br>
illustrates a working mode of the compressor wherein the washers 40 have<br>
expanded in response to the pressure drop in the air system to or below the<br>
reference value. As a result, the cam collar is axially displaced to pivot the swash<br>
plate whose movement generates the suction and compression strokes of the<br>
pistons.<br>
To prevent the outer part 42 of the swash plate assembly from rotating, the<br>
swash plate receives a radially extending stopper 60 which engages an axial<br>
groove 64 of the housing 62, as seen in FIG. 8. The groove is defined between<br>
two axial ribs extending from an inner surface of the housing toward the swash<br>
plate. The groove and the stopper are so dimensioned that the stopper's head<br>
does not slide out of engagement with groove even if the plate is maximally<br>
displaced from its neutral position, as shown in FIG. 3. Note that rods 30, 56 and<br>
stopper 60 can be all threaded, and thus can be easily assembled or replaced.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the actuating assembly 41<br>
shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 includes a servo piston 70 which can be housed within<br>
the compressor housing, but for the illustrative purposes is shown outside the<br>
housing. The servo piston is actuated in response to a pilot signal generated by<br>
an external source 78, which may be pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical. The pilot<br>
signal represents the reference value of the air system's pressure and is<br>
generated once the pressure falls down to or below the threshold.<br>
The servo piston is attached to a mechanical link 72, 74 such as a fork, which is<br>
connected to the cam collar 38. As a result of displacement of the servo piston,<br>
the fork displaces the cam collar which exerts a thrust sufficient to pivotally<br>
displace the swash plate from its neutral position and cause the pistons to<br>
reciprocate. Upon reaching the desirable pressure in the air system, the servo<br>
piston is brought in its initial position corresponding to the vertical position of the<br>
swash plate with respect to the axis of the shaft.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, a radially extending air inlet 80 is provided<br>
in a head plate 84 and a cylinder block 82 made of heat resistant material. The<br>
pistons are idle in the state of equilibrium and are in a position wherein they<br>
block the air inlet, preventing thus the entry of outside air. As the oscillating<br>
swash plate displaces the pistons, the air inlet opens allowing the outer air to be<br>
drawn into the bores above the piston heads, which during the compression<br>
stroke deliver the compressed air to the air system through the discharge port<br>
20.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 12, to temporarily release the engine of the truck from<br>
an additional load under certain conditions, such as when a truck climbs up a<br>
steep hill, a solenoid 86 can close the discharge port 88 upon an on-demand<br>
signal from a driver. As a result, the pressure above the pistons in the cylinder<br>
block rapidly rises enabling the compressor to reach the state of equilibrium<br>
within a short period of time. Opening of the solenoid allows the compressor to<br>
return to a normal mode of operation.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 2, a vehicle is provided with a central processing<br>
init 90 receiving for example a signal, which is generated by a pressure sensor<br>
92 after air pressure in the air system has reached a predetermined high<br>
threshold. Once this signal is processed, the solenoid is actuated to block the<br>
discharge port.<br>
Furthermore, the central processing unit 90, which is typically a computer, is able<br>
to process a signal 94 indicating the overall load on the vehicle's engine. Thus, if<br>
a signal indicative of the load exceeds a certain threshold, the processing unit<br>
generates a pilot signal actuating the solenoid, which closes up the discharge<br>
port. In this case, the compressor rapidly achieves the state of equilibrium, as<br>
explained above, and stops compressing air.<br>
Since the reciprocal motion of the pistons is arrested after the state of<br>
equilibrium is reached, the need in lubrication between the pistons and the head<br>
of the compressor is reduced. As a consequence, oil passage into the air stream<br>
is also reduced. Furthermore, to minimize the effects of oil passage on the air<br>
stream even further, the cylinder bores and piston cups are coated with wear-<br>
resistant materials. Thus, piston cups are associated with a material selected<br>
from the group including a PTFE material filled with bronze and Molybdenum<br>
Disulfide and a PTFE material filled with graphite and PPS. Anodized aluminum<br>
coating (close to 60RC hardness) is applied to the surfaces of the cylinder bores.<br>
In fact, the proper selection of coating materials along with the controllable<br>
motion of the pistons can lead to a structure in which lubrication between the<br>
pistons and the head of the compressor is not necessary.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular<br>
arrangements of parts, features and the like, these are not intended to exhaust<br>
all possible arrangements or features, and indeed many other modifications and<br>
variations will be ascertainable to those of skill in the art.<br>
