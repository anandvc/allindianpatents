				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to novel isoxazole and crotonamide derivatives, their preparation and use as pharmaceuticals, and their use as an antigen for the production of antibodies and their use in diagnosis and purification processes.<br>
Isoxazole and crotonamide derivatives having antiinflammatory, immunosuppressant or antiproliferative action have been disclosed (EP 0 013 376; EP 0 217 206; EP 0 527 736), The analytical determination of these compounds in animal and human sera is possible with the aid of conventional chromatographic processes. The disadvantage of these chromatographic processes is a high outlay in terms of apparatus, complicated sample preparation steps and low sample throughput.<br>
Immunological determination and analysis processes are a rapid and reliable alternative to chromatographic processes. The production of suitable antibodies is crucial for carrying out these alternative processes.<br>
The invention aims, by modification of isoxazole and crotonamide derivatives, to make available compounds which are suitable for antibody production, can be coupled to polymers and can be employed as tracers in radioimmunoassays.<br>
It has been found that compounds of the formula I are suitable for achieving this object where, on the aromatic ring of the aniline moiety, there are one or more functional groups which can be coupled covalently to polymers as such or via a spacer function.<br><br><br>
and/or a physiologically tolerable salt of the compound of the formula I and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I, where R^ is the radical of the formula II or III<br><br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I are those wherein R" is the radical of the formula II or III and<br><br><br>
Particularly preferred compounds of the formula I are those such as 2-cyano-3-hydroxybut-2-enecarboxylicacid(4-allyloxyphenyl)amide, 2-cyano-3-hydroxybut-2-enecarboxylicacid (4-(3-iodopropoxy)phenyl)amide, 2-cyano-3-hydroxybut-2-enecarboxylicacid(4-(2-aminoacetylamino)phenyi)amide, 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylicacid (4-(2-aminoacetylamino)phenyl)amide, 2-cyano-3-hydroxybut-2-enecarboxylicacid(4-(2-bromoacetylamino)phenyi)amide or 5-methylisoxa2ole-4-carboxylic acid (4-(2-bronnoacetylamino)phenyl)amide<br>
The radical R^ in formula I can be in the meta-, ortho- or para-posJtion relative to the "NH" group on the phenyl ring, preferably in the para-position.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can optionally be present as optical isomers,<br>
diastereomers, racemates or as mixtures thereof. The term "amino acid" is<br>
understood as meaning the stereoisomeric forms, e.g. D and L forms, of the<br>
following compounds:<br>
asparaglne, valine, arginine, asparticacid, glutamine, glutamic acid, tryptophan, p-<br>
alanlne, lysine, proline, glycine, y-aminobutyrate, Ne-acetyllysine, N5-<br>
acetylornithine, Nv-acetyldiaminobutyrate, Na-acetyldiaminobutyrate, histidine,<br>
isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, alanine<br>
and tyrosine.<br>
L-Amino acids are preferred. The amino acid residue Gly is particularly preferred.<br>
Amino acid residues are derived from the corresponding amino acids. The brief notation for the amino acids follows the generally customary notation. The radical (R"*) represents the side chain of the respective amino acid.<br><br>
Suitable physiologically tolerable salts of the compounds of the formula I are, for example, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts, including those of organic ammonium bases and salts of the protonated amino acid residues.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerable salt of a compound of the formula I and/or an optionally stereo isomeric form of a compound of the formula I, which comprises<br><br>
b)       reacting a compound prepared by process a), In which R^ is -OH, with an<br><br>
al[<yl halide or a dihaloalkane in which the alkyl moiety has carbon atoms to give corresponding compound of formula i></yl>
c)	reacting a compound prepared by process a), in which R^ is -OH, with an unsaturated alkyl halide in which the alkyl moiety has 3, 4 or 5 carbon atoms to give a corresponding compound of the formula I, or<br>
d)	reacting a compound prepared by process a), in which R^ is -NH2, with a carboxylic acid halide such as bromoacetyl bromide to give a compound of the formula I in which R^ is the radical of the formula V, R^ Is halogen and R^ is a hydrogen atom, or<br>
e)	reacting an aromatic diamine such as p-phenylenediamine with an amino acid protected on the amino group to give a compound of the formula VII in which R^ is a radical of the formula V, R^ is -NH2 and R^ is a protected amino acid and then reacting as in process a) to give a corresponding compound of the formula I, or<br>
f)	removing the protective group in a compound of the formula I prepared by process a) or e), or<br>
g)	converting a compound of the formula t prepared by processes a) - f), where R^ Is the radical of the formula II, Into a compound of the formula I where R^ is the radical of the formula III, or<br>
h)       either isolating the compound of the formula I prepared by processes a) - g) in free form or, in the case of the presence of acidic or basic groups, optionally converting it into physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
In the process step according to a), it is possible to convert, for example, an isoxazole-4-carboxylic acid (R^ is -OH) into an acid chloride by methods known from the literature, e.g. by means of thionyl chloride or phosphorus oxychloride in an aprotic solvent (e.g. toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or a chlorinated hydrocarbon)<br><br>
and then to react it with an aromatic amine which is optionally substituted in a suitable manner with addition of an organic base, e.g. with a tertiary amine (e.g. triethylamine or N-ethylmorpholine), in a dipolar aprotic solvent, for example THF or a chlorinated hydrocarbon. Alternatively, the amide formation can be carried out directly from the carboxylic acid with addition of a condensing reagent known from peptide chemistry, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The second variant is particularly suitable for aromatic amines having further amino or alcohol radicals.<br>
In process steps b) or c), the hydroxyl group introduced by means of the aniline moiety is further functionalized by reacting this<br>
1)	with an alky! halide or a dihaloalkane such as 1,3-diiodopropane with addition of an organic or inorganic base, e.g. potassium carbonate, to give a correspondingly substituted araliphatic ether, where in the latter case dimerization can be avoided by an appropriately large excess of alkylating agent or use thereof as a solvent, such that In the product an alkyl halide function remains for the further coupling of the product to a stationary phase, or<br>
2)	reacting with an unsaturated alkyl halide, e.g. an allyl or propargyl halide, preferably allyl bromide, In a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone or chlorinated hydrocarbons under similar conditions to an allyl or propargyl ether, where when using acetone as a solvent and potassium carbonate as a base simultaneously the ring opening of the isoxazole moiety (radical of the formula II) described under g) occurs.<br>
In process step d), the amino group is reacted with a carboxylic acid halide, e.g. bromoacetyl bromide, with addition of an organic base such as a tertiary aromatic amine (e.g. triethylamine or N-elhylmorpl^oline) in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as THF or a chlorinated hydrocarbon.<br>
In process step e), an aromatic diamine, e.g. p-phenylenediamine, is converted into the monoamide in a controlled manner using an amino acid protected on the amino group, e.g. N-Boc-glycine, using a condensing agent, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, then the anilide formation is carried out as described under process step a), and finally the amine protective group carried along is removed under standard<br><br>
conditions known from peptide chemistry (process step f)).<br>
In process step g), a compound prepared under a) - f) is subjected to a base-Induced ring opening of the Isoxazole moiety, the reaction preferably being carried out in an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, e.g. THF/water or ethanol/vi/ater, using an excess of an organic or inorganic base, e.g. NaOH, ammonia solution or potassium carbonate.<br>
Provided the compounds of the general formula I occur in diastereoisomeric or enantiomeric forms and are obtained in the selected synthesis as mixtures thereof, separation into the pure stereoisomers is carried out either by chromatography on an optionally chiral support material, or, provided the racemic compounds of the formula I are capable of salt formation, by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed with an optically active base or acid as auxiliary. In a manner which is identical in principle, the racemic compounds of the formula I which contain a basic group such as an amino group can be converted into the pure enantiomers using optically active acids such as (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, D-and L-tartaric acid, D- and L-lactic acid or (+) and {-)-mandelic acid.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which contain an efficacious amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or a stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerable salt of the compound of the formula I, in addition to pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerable excipients, additives and/or active compounds and auxiliaries. The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered intravenously, parenterally, topically, rectally or orally.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the Invention are preferably suitable for the prophylaxis andMr therapy of carcinomatous diseases, inflammations and autoimmune diseases.<br>
These include, for example, rheumatic diseases, acute and chronic inflammations of muscles, joints or of the gastrointestinal tract, allergic ain/vay diseases, psoriasis or<br><br>
autoimmune diseases, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (SUE), type II diabetes,   ,-^" myasthenia gravis, Sjogren syndrome, dermatomyositis, sclerodermatitis or multiple sclerosis (MS). The carcinomatous diseases include, for example, lung cancer, leukemia, Kaposi"s sarcoma, ovarian cancer, sarcoma, meningioma, intestinal cancer, cancer of the lymph nodes, brain tumors, breast cancer, stomach cancer, cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the prostate or skin cancer.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical according to the invention, which comprises bringing at least one compound of the formula I into a suitable administration form using a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerable excipient and, if appropriate, further suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable solid or liquid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions, and preparations having protracted release of active compound, in whose preparation customary auxiliaries, such as excipients, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are, for example, talc, starch, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, lactoprotein, gelatin, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils such as cod liver oil, sunflower, groundnut or sesame oil, polyethylene glycols and solvents, such as, for example, sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols, e.g. glycerol.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably prepared and administered in dose units, each unit containing as active constituent a certain dose of the compound of the formula I according to the invention. In the case of solid dose units such as tablets, capsules, coated tablets or suppositories, this dose can be up to approximately 1000 mg, but preferably approximately 50 to 300 mg, and in the case of injection solutions in ampoule form up to approximately 300 mg, but preferably approximately 10 to 100 mg. For the treatment of an adult patient approximately 70 kg in weight - depending on the efficacy of the compound of the formula I - in the<br><br>
case of humans and animals daily doses of approximately 50 to 3000 mg of active compound, preferably approximately 150 to 1000 mg, are indicated in the case of oral administration and of approximately 50 to 1000 mg, preferably approximately 100 to 300 mg, in the case of intravenous administration. Under certain circumstances, however, higher or lower daily doses may also be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered either by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else of several smaller dose units or by multiple administration of subdivided doses at specific intervals.<br>
The invention further relates to a compound of the formula I which is optionally coupled to polymers or solids via bridging members.<br>
These are compounds of the formula IV<br><br><br><br>
e)       a bridging member L, defined as under a) to d), which has a spacer, in which the spacer is a radical of the group 1)       -NH-(CH2)m-S-, in which m is an integer from 1 to 12, and X        is a polymer or solid.<br>
The radical "L-X" in the formula IV can be in the meta-, ortho- or para-position relative to the "NH" group on the phenyl ring, preferably in the para-position. The term "polymer" is understood as meaning, for example, synthetic or natural polymers from the group consisting of polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, latex, polysaccharides, Sepharose, proteins, lipids, silicates or nucleic acids. The polymers optionally have to be provided with one or more functional radicals from the group consisting of -OH, -COOH, -NHj and -CO- in order that they can be coupled to the compounds of the formula I. General methods for the coupling of the compounds of the formula I to solids are described, for example, in Bl Application Handbook, Ed. 1994, Figure 4.1, (MerkAB, Uppsala, Sweden). The term "solid" represents insoluble bodies which can be particulates or can occur in geometric embodiments such as tubes, beads or microtiter plates.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula IV are those where a compound of the formula I is coupled to a solid or a polymer. Particularly preferred compounds of the formula IV are those where a compound of the formula I such as 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid (4-{2-bromoacetylamino)phenyl)amide or 2-cyano-3-hydroxybut-2-enecarboxylic acid (4-(2-bromoacetylamino)phenyl)amide is coupled to a solid or a polymer.<br>
The compounds of the formula IV are also suitable for the discovery of specific-<br><br>
binding proteins from cell extracts, serum, blood or synovial fluids, for the purification of proteins, for the modification of microtiter plates or for the preparation of chromatography material, in particular of affinity chromatography material. The proteins suitable for purification are in direct interaction with the compounds of the formula I bound to the polymer or solid. The compounds are also suitable for use in diagnostics.<br>
A particularly suitable solid in the case of the compounds of the formula IV is a ®BIA core CMS chip or a stationary phase for chromatographic investigations or separations, and also microtiter plates.<br>

Obtainment and processing of the spleen cells for mitogen-induced lymphocyte<br>
proliferation<br>
The mice are killed by cervical dislocation and the spleens are removed under<br>
sterile conditions. The spleens are cut up on a sterile sieve having a mesh width of<br>
80 mesh and, using the plunger of a plastic syringe (10 ml), carefully strained into a<br>
Petri dish containing use medium. To remove the erythrocytes from the spleen cell<br>

Mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation<br>
5x10^ processed spleen cells from female NMRI mice are pipetted together with<br>
various mitogens and preparation (compound of the formula I) into 200 pi of test<br>
medium per hollow in flat-bottom microliter plates. The following mitogen and<br>
preparation concentrations are used:<br>
Concanavalin A [Serva]:	0.5 - 0.25 - 0.12 pg/ml<br>
Lipopolysacchahde [Calbiochem]:	1.0 - 0.5   - 0.1   pg/ml<br>

Pokeweed mitogen [Gibco] compound 1 or 2:    50, 25, 10, 7.5, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0,1<br>
Ijmol. The positive controls are defined as the group m\h mitogen additions and without preparation. The negative controls are cells in culture medium with preparation and without mitogen additions. Each mitogen concentration is tested four times with all preparation concentrations. After incubation at 37""C/5% COj for 48 h, 25 pl/hollow of tritium-thymidine (Amersham) having an activity of 0.25 pCi/hollow (9.25x10^ Bq) is added to the cells. A further incubation under the same conditions for a period of 16 h follows. To evaluate the test batch, the cells are harvested on filter paper by means of a cell harvester (Flow Laboratories), nonincorporated thymidine being collected in a separate waste bottle. The filter paper is dried, punched out and added to scintillation containers together with 2 ml of scintillator (Rotiszint 22, Roth), which are then cooled at 4X for a further 2 h. The amount of the radioactivity incorporated by the cells is measured in a beta-counter (Packard, Tricarb-460c), Preparation of the tumor cells and cell lines for the proliferation test The tumor cells or cell lines used in the test are taken from the stock solution in the logarithmic grovrth phase, washed twice with wash medium and suspended in the appropriate medium.<br>
Carrying-out and evaluation of the proliferation tests<br>
The proliferation test is carried out in round-bottom miaotlter plates. Compounds of the formula I and interleukins are dissolved in 50 pi each/hollow of the appropriate medium and the cell count (5^10^) is adjusted with 100 yil/hollow so that a final volume of 200 pl/hollow results. In all tests, the values are determined four times. Cells without preparations and without growth factor are defined as a negative control and cells without preparation with grovrth factor afford the values for the positive control. The value of the negative control is subtracted from all values determined and the difference of positive control minus negative control is set at 100%.<br>
The microtiter plates are incubated at 37°C/5% COg for 72 h and the proliferation rate is determined correspondingly as in mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. The cell lines were obtained from the strain collection, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).<br><br>

Affinity chromatography<br>
The compound according to Example 1 is coupled to a support matrix via its reactive bromine group. The support material employed is Fractogel® EMD-SH (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt). The covalent bonding is carried out according to a standard protocol as specified in DE 43 10 964. The gel obtained is packed into a Superformance® (1 cm x 5 cm) column (Merck KGaA) and connected to a high-pressure liquid chromatography unit (HPLC).<br><br>
Obtainment of the soluble cell proteins<br>
The strain RAW 264.7 (ATCC strain collection) is cultured for 48 hours (h) until reaching confluence and washed free of the culture medium three times with cold, A°C PBS buffer, and the cells are transferred to PBS buffer and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min. The cell processing is carried out at 4°C. The cell pellet is resuspended in buffer A consisting of 20 mM tris base, 2 mM MgCl2 x 6 H2O and 1 mM dithiotreitol (DTT). A mixture of various protease inhibitors is added in order to prevent protolysis by cell-endogenous proteases. The mixture is then homogenized in a glass potter. The suspension is then centrifuged at 22,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to obtain the soluble proteins.<br>
The supernatant is immediately reused for affinity chromatography. An aliquot of the supernatant is retained as a reference and the remainder Is pumped onto the affinity column.<br>

The fractions are collected, dialyzed against HgO at 4X for 48 h (exclusion limit of the dialysis membrane used 6000-8000 Da) (apart from acetonitrile fraction) and then lyophilized. Protein determination<br>
After the lyophilization, the proteins are dissolved in 1 ml of 1 % sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and diluted to 0.5% SDS with water. Aliquots of this solution are taken and employed for the protein determination using the BCA test (Pierce). The proteins are evaporated (UNIVASPO 150H, UniEquip Power Heater, Martinsried, Germany) and then taken up in a suitable volume of sample buffer, consistingof 10 g of sucrose, 9 ml of 0.25 Mtris/IM glycine solution, 7.8 ml of 10% SDS, 2.5 ml of Bromophenol Blue (0.1%), 4 ml of (1-mercaptoethanol and 1.7 ml of water.<br>

For the preparation of an SDS gel having a polyacrylamide gradient of 10-17%, the<br>
following solutions are prepared.<br>
A:	B:<br>
5     ml of     acrylamide (30 %, 0,5 %)  8.5     ml of   acrylamide (30 %, 0.5 %)<br>

6.12 ml of     water	3,275 ml of   glycerol<br>
0.15 ml of     SDS	0.15   ml of   SDS<br>
The polymerization is started by addition of 100 pi of 10% APS and 12.5 pi of<br>
TEMED. The collecting gel is prepared from 3 ml of acrylamide (10%, 0.5%), 1.36 ml<br>
of water, 1.45 ml of 0.5 M tris (pH 6.8), 60 |jl of 10% SDS, 106 pi of 10% APS and<br>
9 Ml of TEMED.<br>
For the preparation of the analytical gels, approximately 10 pg of protein per track<br>
are loaded, for preparative gels 100 pg.<br>
The determination of the molecular weight is carried out by comparison with protein<br>
standard mixtures.<br><br>
Sequencing<br>
Protein fractions which show bands of concentrated proteins in the analytical gel are separated on a preparative scale and the separated proteins are immobilized by blotting on a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The proteins are visualized by staining with Coomassie and then subjected directly to Edman degradation. Proteins whose N-terminus is blocked are carefully cut out after electrophoresis on Coomassie-stained gels and washed with water until neutral. The small pieces of gel are pressed by two steel sieves lying one behind the other and having a mesh width of 100 pm and 32 pm and thus homogenized. The ointment-like material is dried to a low residual moisture in the UNIVAPO 150 H (UniEquip Power Heater, Martinsried, Germany). The proteins thus obtained are cleaved to peptides by incubation at 37X for 7 h with the enzyme endoproteinase LysdC (Boehringer Mannheim) (enzyme to protein ratio approximately 1:10) in a buffer consisting of 25 mM tris HCI, pH 8.5 and 1 mM EDTA.<br>
The peptides obtained are eluted twice at 37°C for 4 h using 1 ml each of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. The combined eluates are evaporated in the UNIVAPO, and the peptides obtained are separated by reversed-phase chromatography. The chromatography is carried out on a LiChroCART® 125-2 Superspher® 60 column using a linear gradient (1%/min) of A: 0.1 % TFA in H2O to B: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile in 70 min.<br>
The amino acid sequence of the purified peptides is carried out according to the Edman degradation principle on a 477 A gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The identification of the PTH-AA is carried out on a 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems) at 269 nm.<br>
Western Blot analysis<br>
After the transfer of proteins from an SDS gel to the PVDF membrane (Millipore), the uncoated area is blocked by incubation for 2 h with 2.5% chicken albumin (Sigma) in TBS, consisting of 45 g of NaCI, 30.3 g of tris base in 5 I, pH 7.4.<br>
The first antibody is diluted in a suitable ratio with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h. The blot is then washed three times for 5 min with TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with the second, POD-labelled antibody. The washing process is<br><br>
repeated and the bound antibody is visualized by means of a solution of 60 mg of 4-chloro-1 -naphthol, 20 ml of methanol, 100 ml of TBS and 200 pi of hydrogen peroxide (30%),<br>
It was possible to identify the proteins which were obtained in the NaCI (3) and A771726b (5) fractions (see Table 2) by means of 7 to 14 amino acid-long peptides. In the case of the 22 kDa protein, the determined amino acid sequence could be assigned to two proteins, MSP23 and NKEF-A. The reason for this lies in the high sequence homology of the two proteins of 93%. The sequencing results of the affinity chromatography were summarized in Table 3.<br><br>
The fraction No. according to Table 2 is in brackets in the column fraction.<br><br>
Description of the identified proteins<br>
The 18 kDa protein concentrated in fraction (3) was identified as cyclophilin A. Cyclophilin A belongs to the large family of peptidylpropyl cis/trans isomerases which are involved in the mechanism of action of a number of immunosuppressant preparations, e.g. cyclosporin A.<br>
Lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of anaerobic glycolysis which catalyzes the reaction of pyruvate to lactate, was additionally identified in fraction (3). Lactate dehydrogenase occurs in animal tissue in at least five different isoenzyme forms. The isoenzyme prevalent in skeletal muscle contains four A chains, that dominant in the heart four B chains. In the present case, a peptide from the A chain of lactate dehydrogenase was identified.<br>
Two proteins which belong to the heat shock proteins family were identified in fraction (5). The heat shock protein HSP70 dominant in eukaryotes is a member of a multigene family.<br>
The heat shock protein HSP90 is a cytosolic protein which is constitutively expressed even under normal conditions. It consists of two separate gene products, HSP84 and HSP86, which mutually have a sequence homology of 86%. It is known of HSP90 that It forms a complex with steroid hormone receptors and in this manner intervenes in the transcription of certain genes.<br>
In fraction (5), three proteins of glycolysis were additionally found with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase M2 and phosphoglycerate mutase. These three enzymes derive from the lower phase of glycolysis and are present under native conditions in a multienzyme complex.<br>
A band which was also concentrated very strongly in fraction (5) was identified as the elongation factor {EF-1 a). EF-1 a is an important eukaryotic translation factor. It is comparable in its function with the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-Tu and during protein biosynthesis in a GTP-dependent process transports aminoacyl-tRNAs from the cytosol to their acceptor sites on the ribosome.<br><br>
It was additionally possible to detect actin in fraction (5). Actin is a protein occurring almost everywhere and in large amounts in eukaryotes. It is the main constituent of the musculature and of the cytoskeleton. The actin multigene family codes for at least four muscle actin forms and also for two cytoplasmic actin forms {P- and y-actin). The actin present here is the y-chain of the cytoplasmic actin form.<br>
An enzyme of the citric acid cycle and of the malate-aspartate shuttle, malate dehydrogenase, was also identified. Malate dehydrogenase occurs in animal tissue in a cytosolic and a mitochondrial isoform. Both isoenzymes, in cooperation with aspartate aminotransferase, play an important part in the malate-aspartate shuttle between cytosol and mitochondrium.<br>
The 22 kDa protein of fraction (5) was assigned to two proteins on the basis of the sequenced peptide fragment: the macrophage 23 kDa stress protein (MSP23) also known as osteoblast-specific factor 3 {OSF-3) and the "natural killer cell enhancing factor-A" (NKEF-A). Activated macrophages produce reactive oxygen compounds such as H2O2 and 02- Since they themselves withstand this oxidative stress, they must have an effective defense system in order to be able to protect themselves from these reactive compounds. NKEF is a cytosolic protein from human red blood cells which increases the activity of the natural killer cells. These are lymphocytes and, after cytokine stimulation, are able to recognize and to destroy a large number of tumor cells. The "natural killer cell enhancing factor" has a molecular weight of 44 kDa and consists of two subunits of equal size (NKEF-A and NKEF-B), which mutually have a good sequence homology of 88%.<br>
Example 11<br>
Comparative affinity chromatography of unstimulated, LPS-stimulated and LPS-<br>
stimulated, leflunomide-treated RAW 264.7 cytosol extracts<br>
The stimulation of the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with lipopolysaccharide was used as an in vitro model for inflammatory processes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential structural constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is recognized as such by immune cells of almost all organisms. In particular.<br><br>
macrophages are activated by LPS stimulation to synthesize a number of cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6. Potential changes in the protein pattern which accompany this stimulation should be prevented by the simultaneous administration of the immunoregulatory preparation leflunomide.<br>
RAW 264.7 cells were Incubated with 10 ng of LPS/ml of culture medium for 24 hours. In the case of LPS-stimulated, leflunomide-treated cells, Incubation was simultaneously carried out with 60 |JM A 77 1726B for 24 hours. The cells were processed and the cytosolic extracts investigated by affinity chromatography with the aid of the Fractogel® column derivatized according to Example 10. The preparation fractions of these three batches were then applied to an analytical gradient gel and compared with one another.<br>
The increase in a band around 35 kDa, which had already been identified by sequencing as malate dehydrogenase, was particularly clearly defined. In comparison wifhihe other protein bands, which tended to be weaker in their intensity on incubation with LPS and A 77 1726B, the intensity of these bands markedly increased.<br><br><br>
