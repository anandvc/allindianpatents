				<td>VARIABLE-RESOLUTION PROCESSING OF FRAME-BASED DATA<br>
[01] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 6P/822,760, filed on August 18,2006, and titled "Variable-<br>
Resolution Filtering", which application is incorporated by reference herein as though set<br>
forth herein in full.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] The present invention pertains to signal processing, such as processing of<br>
audio signals.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[03] Many conventional signal-processing techniques are frame-based. In<br>
such techniques, a stream of data is divided into discrete frames, and the data within each<br>
such frame ordinarily is processed in a fairly uniform manner. In one example, an input<br>
audio signal is divided into frames of equal length. Then, each frame is processed in a<br>
particular maimer. A common processing parameter to be determined for each frame is<br>
block length or, equivalently, into how many equal-sized blocks should the frame be<br>
divided for processing purposes. Block length determines resolution in the original<br>
domain (e.g., time for an audio signal) and in the frequency (or other transform) domain.<br>
More specifically, shorter block lengths provide greater resolution in the original domain<br>
and lesser resolution in the frequency domain.<br>
[04] An audio signal often consists of quasi-stationary episodes, each<br>
including a number of tonal frequency components, which are interrupted by dramatic<br>
transients. Thus, an individual frame of such an audio signal often wall include a few<br>
samples corresponding to a transient, but with the vast majority of the samples<br>
corresponding to quasi-stationary portions of the signal.<br>
[05] Because transients in audio signals can be as short as a few of samples,<br>
the block size that is used within a frame that has been detected as including a transient<br>
ideally should be just a few samples as well, thereby matching the filter's temporal<br>
resolution to the transient. Unfortunately, it usually is not practical to use different block<br>
sizes within the same frame. Making all of the blocks within a frame having a detected<br>
transient just a few samples wide would result in extremely poor frequency resolution<br><br>
within the frame and, therefore, is inappropriate for the rest of the samples in the frame;<br>
that is, such other samples, provided they are suffciently far away from the transient, are<br>
quasi-stationary and therefore are better processed using high frequency resolution. This<br>
conflict conventionally has resulted in a compromise block size that is optimal neither<br>
for the transient samples no" for the quasi-stationary samples in the same frame.<br>
[06] A block diagram of a conventional system for processing a frame of input<br>
samples 12 is illustrated in figure 1. Initially, samples 12 are analyzed in transient<br>
detector 14 to determine whether the frame includes a transient.<br>
[07] "Based on that detection, a window function is selected in module 16. In<br>
this regard, audio-coding algorithms often employ a filter bank that has different<br>
temporal-frequency resolutions. One commonly used filter bank is the MDCT (Modified<br>
Discrete Cosine Transform), having an impulse response that can be described by the<br>
following basis function:<br><br>
where k = 0 1,..., M-1 ; n = 0,1,..., 2M-1 ; and w(n) is a window function of length<br>
2M. See, e.g., H. S. Malvar, "Signal Processing with Lapped Transforms", Artech<br>
House, 1992 (referred to herein as Malvar).<br>
[08] In this case, the temporal-frequency resolution is determined by M, which<br>
sometimes is referred to herein block size. A large M means low temporal resolution<br>
but high frequency resolution, while a small M means high temporal resolution and low<br>
frequency resolution.<br>
[091 For purposed of implementing module 16 (as shown in Figure 1),<br>
conventional coding algorithms typically use two block sizes. A large block size,<br>
implemented as a single block covering the entire frame, is used if no transient was<br>
detected in module 14. Alternatively, a small block size, implemented as a<br>
predetermined number of blocks covering the frame, is used if a transient was detected.<br>
[10] The principal window functions corresponding to these two block sizes<br>
are window function 30 (shown in Figure 2 and labeled as WIN_LONG_LONG2LONG)<br>
and window function 40 (shown in Figure 3 and labeled as<br>
WIN SHORT SHORT2SHORT), respectively. In order for the MDCT to be able to<br>
properly switch between these two principal window functions, the perfect<br>
reconstruction conditions (e.g., as described in Malvar) require the use of three<br><br>
transitional window functions, e.g.: window function 50 (shown in Figure 16 and<br>
labeled as WIN_LONG_LONG2SHORT), window function 60 (shown in Figure 5 and<br>
labeled as WIN_LONG_SHORT2LONG), and window function 70 (shown in Figure 6<br>
and labeled as WIN_LONG_SHORT2SHORT). It is noted that all three such<br>
transitional window functions 50, 60 and 70 are for use with the long block (i.e.,<br>
covering an entire frame).<br>
[11] Thus, in the conventional techniques a frame is assigned a single long<br>
block (and corresponding long window 30, 50, 60 or 70) or a sequence of identical short<br>
blocks (and corresponding identical short windows 40). Because each block is longer<br>
than the block-to-block spacing, the result is an overlapping sequence of long and short<br>
windows, such as the sequence 80 of window functions shown in Figure 7, with each<br>
window covering the M new samples of the current block together with M samples in the<br>
previous block. For reference purposes, the middle of each block corresponding to a<br>
window function 30,40, 50, 60 or 70 is designated as31,41,51,61 or 71, respectively,<br>
in the drawings.<br>
[12] It is noted that such conventional techniques select the window function<br>
for a frame that does not include a transient, based not only on the detection made by<br>
module 14 for such current frame, but also based on similar detections made for the<br>
previous and subsequent frames. That is, window functions 50, 60 and 70 are used as<br>
transition window functions between transient frames and non-transient frames.<br>
(131 Referring back to Figure 1, in module 17 the window function selected in<br>
module 16 is then applied (multiple times for a transient frame) to the input samples 12<br>
for the current frame. That is, for each block the sample values are multiplied by the<br>
window function values corresponding to that block in order to obtain a set of weighted<br>
values.<br>
[14] Those weighted values are then processed in module 19 using the selected<br>
window function to provide the output values 22. The specific type of processing<br>
performed in module 19 can vary depending upon the desired application. For example,<br>
with respect to an audio signal, the processing might involve analysis, coding, and/or<br>
enhancement.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[15] The present invention addresses this problem and others by, inter alia,<br>
using multiple different window functions within a frame that has been detected as<br>
including a transient. In the preferred embodiment, the present invention provides at<br>
least two levels of resolution within a single data frame having a detected transient.<br>
More preferably, such multiple resolutions are provided without changing the block size<br>
within the frame.<br>
(16] As a result, e.g., a higher resolution can be used in the vicinity of the<br>
transient and a lower resolution used in other portions of the frame. It is noted that<br>
unqualified use of the term "resolution" herein refers to resolution in the original (e.g.,<br>
temporal) domain. Because resolution in the frequency (or other transform) domain<br>
varies inversely with a resolution in the original domain, in these embodiments of the<br>
invention a higher frequency (or other transform-domain) resolution is provided for<br>
portions of the frame that do not include the transient. Moreover, by holding block size<br>
constant, the foregoing advantages generally can be achieved without complicating the<br>
processing structure.<br>
[17] Thus, in one respect, the invention is directed to processing frame-based<br>
data, in which a frame of data, an indication that a transient occurs within the frame, and<br>
a location of the transient within the fiame are obtained. Based on the indication of the<br>
transient, a block size is set for the frame, thereby effectively defining a plurality of<br>
equal-sized blocks within the frame. In addition, different window functions are selected<br>
for different ones of the plurality of equal-sized blocks based on the location of the<br>
transient, and the frame of data is processed by applying the selected window functions.<br>
[18] In the preferred embodiments, the blocks overlap each other, and each<br>
window function also overlaps each adjacent window function, preferably in a manner so<br>
as to satisfy the perfect reconstruction conditions. The foregoing properties preferably<br>
apply to adjacent blocks and window functions withm a fiame, as well as to adjacent<br>
blocks and window functions in adjacent firames.<br>
[19] In any case, the window functions preferably are selected to provide<br>
higher resolution within an identified one of the equal-sized blocks that includes the<br>
transient. Moreover, this preferably is achieved by using, within the identified block a<br>
transient window function that is narrower than others of the window functions (e.g., by<br>
zeroing samples within the block but outside of the transient window function). In other<br><br>
words, while the width of the block remains constant across the frame, the widths of the<br>
window functions within those blocks can be varied, if desired, to achieve the desired<br>
resolution trade-off (e.g., temporal/frequency) for each block of the frame.<br>
[20] In this regard, the width of a window function can be defined in a number<br>
of different ways. For example, it can be defined as the length of the non-zero portion of<br>
the window function, the length of that portion of the window function above a specified<br>
threshold, or the length of that portion of the window function that includes some<br>
specified percentage of the content (e.g., energy) of the window function.<br>
[21] Accordingly, the width of a window function can be varied by<br>
compressing or expanding a standard shape and then zeroing any samples within the<br>
block but not included within the compressed shape. Alternatively, the width can be<br>
varied by using different shapes, some with more of their energy concentrated in a<br>
smaller segment.<br>
[22] In another respect, the invention is directed to processing frame-based<br>
data, in which a fiame of data, an indication that a transient occurs within the frame, and<br>
a location of the transient within the fiame are obtained. Different window functions are<br>
selected for use within the frame so that higher resolution is provided within a region that<br>
includes the transient, and the frame of data is processed by applying the selected<br>
window functions.<br>
[231 The foregoing summary is intended merely to provide a brief description<br>
of the certain aspects of the invention. A more complete understanding of the invention<br>
can be obtained by referring to the claims and the following detailed description of the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
[44] The present invention is directed primarily to improvements in the<br>
window function selection component 16 of the conventional systems. One feature of<br>
the present invention is the introduction of a new "brief window function", e.g., window<br>
function 100 as shown in Figure 8. This window function 100, labeled as<br>
WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF, is intended to be used within a short block, similar to<br>
conventional window function WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SHORT 40. In fact, as described<br>
in more detail below, in the preferred embodiments of the invention window function<br>
WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF 100 is intended for use within the same frame as window<br>
function WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SHORT 40.<br>
[45] However, unlike conventional window functions, brief window function<br>
100 uses for signal shaping only a central portion of the overall length of the block<br>
(having endpoints 102 and 103 in Figure 8) it occupies, employing a number of leading<br>
and trailing zero weights, in order to improve its temporal resolution. For example,<br>
where the short block length = 256 samples, the brief window function 100 preferably is<br>
nonzero within the central 160 samples (where it also is symmetric), with the first 16 and<br>
last 16 of such samples overlapping the respective transition window functions that are<br>
adjacent to it, and with zero weights for the first 48 samples and the last 48 samples of<br>
the window.<br><br>
[46] In the preferred embodiments of the invention, this brief window function<br>
100 is only used where the transient samples within an audio frame have been detected<br>
(e.g., in the blocks that include transient samples), while the regular short window<br>
function (e.g., conventional window function 40), or one of the new transitional<br>
functions provided by the present invention, is applied to the quasi-stationary samples in<br>
the remainder of the frame. This allows for the following possibilities, as compared with<br>
conventional techniques:<br>
•	A significantly larger block size can be used, in which case the frequency<br>
resolution for the quasi-stationary samples is improved while the temporal<br>
resolution around the transient samples is left unchanged.<br>
•	The block size can be left unchanged, in which case the frequency resolution<br>
for the quasi-stationary samples is unchanged while the temporal resolution<br>
around the transient samples is improved.<br>
•	A somewhat larger block size can be used, in which case the frequency<br>
resolution for quasi-stationary samples is improved somewhat while the<br>
temporal resolution around the transient samples also is improved somewhat.<br>
With any of the above choices, the compromise solution addressing the conflicting<br>
temporal-frequency resolution requirements is improved.<br>
[47] In order to facilitate the use of window function 100 in connection with<br>
the other two principal window functions, namely WIN_LONG_LONG2LONG 30 and<br>
WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SHORT 40 (e.g., in order to satisfy the perfect reconstruction<br>
conditions), additional transitional window functions preferably are introduced.<br>
Examples of such transitional window functions follow. Initially, however, it is noted<br>
that the present disclosure generally uses the nomenclature:<br>
WIN_BlockLength_PriorWF2SubsWF, where BlockLength indicates the length of the<br>
block occupied by the present window function (e.g., long or short), PriorWF identifies<br>
the type of window function in the immediately preceding block (e.g., long, short or<br>
brief), and SubsWF identifies the type of window function in the immediately subsequent<br>
block (e.g., long, short or brief).<br>
(48J Transitional window function 110 (shown in Figure 9 and labeled as<br>
WIN_SHORT_SHORT2BRIEF) is for use within a short block immediately preceding<br>
another short block that includes the transient. That is, it immediately precedes window<br>
function WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF 100.<br><br>
[49] Window function 120 (shown in Figure 10 and labeled as<br>
WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2SHORT) is for use within a short block immediately following<br>
another short block that includes the transient. That is, it immediately follows window<br>
function WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF 100.<br>
[50] Window function 130 (shown in Figure 11 and labeled as<br>
WIN_LONG_LONG2BRIEF) is for use within a long block immediately preceding a<br>
short block that includes the transient That is, it covers a frame immediately preceding a<br>
subsequent frame that includes a transient, the transient being within the very first block<br>
of the subsequent frame.<br>
[51] Window function 140 (shown in Figure 12 and labeled as<br>
WIN_LONG_BRIEF2LONG) is for use within a long block immediately following a<br>
short block that includes the transient. That is, it covers a frame immediately following a<br>
preceding frame that includes a transient, the transient being within the very last block of<br>
the preceding frame.<br>
[52] Window function 150 (shown in Figure 13 and labeled as<br>
WIN_LONG_BRIEF2BRIEF) is for use within a long block sandwiched between two<br>
short blocks that include transients. That is, it covers a frame between two frames that<br>
include transients, the transient in the preceding frame being within its very last block<br>
and the transient in the subsequent frame being within its very first block.<br>
[53] Window function 160 (shown in Figure 14 and labeled as<br>
WIN_LONG_SHORT2BRIEF) is for use within a long block covering a frame between<br>
two frames that include transients, the transient in the preceding frame being somewhere<br>
other than its very last block and the transient in the subsequent frame being within its<br>
very first block.<br>
[54] Window function 170 (shown in Figure 15 and labeled as<br>
WIN_LONG_BRIEF2SHORT) is for use within a long block covering a frame between<br>
two frames that include transients, the transient in the preceding frame being within its<br>
very last block and the transient in the subsequent frame being somewhere other than its<br>
very first block.<br>
[55] In each case, the window function preferably is designed so that it<br>
overlaps the adjacent window function on each side in a manner so as to satisfy the<br>
perfect reconstruction conditions. Specific examples of window functions that may be<br>
used are given below.<br><br>
[56] Figure 16 is a flow diagram illustrating a technique for selecting window<br>
functions according to a representative embodiment of the present invention. Generally<br>
speaking, the entire process illustrated in Figure 16 will be automated (e.g., implemented<br>
in software, firmware, dedicated hardware or any combination thereof).<br>
[57] Initially, in step 202 a frame of data is obtained. In this regard, a variety<br>
of different types of data may be processed according to the present invention.<br>
Throughout this disclosure, it often is assumed that the data correspond to an audio<br>
signal. However, this should not be taken as limiting and the obtained data instead may<br>
be representative of any other physical phenomena, such as an image signal, a video<br>
signal, or a signal representative of heat, pressure, radiation, motion, distance, any<br>
biological function, weather and/or any geological phenomenon.<br>
[58] Also, it should be noted that the data frame may have been defined by the<br>
source of the data (e.g., as where date are being received over a communication channel).<br>
Alternatively, e.g., the data may be received in a continuous stream and segmented (e.g.,<br>
internally) into frames for processing purposes. In any event, the present processing is<br>
particularly (although not exclusively) applicable to data which are separated into<br>
individual frames. As indicated above, frame-based processing allows individual<br>
portions of the overall data stream to be processed in a uniform manner in some<br>
particular respects.<br>
[59] In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, each frame has a<br>
uniform block size. In this regard, the block preferably is defined as the basic signal-<br>
processing unit for the frame. For example, in the event that the data within the frame<br>
are to be transformed (e.g., in the signal-processing module 19) from the original domain<br>
(e.g., the time domain in the event of an audio signal) to the frequency domain (e.g.,<br>
using a Discrete Cosine Transform or a Fast Fourier Transform), or to any other<br>
transform domain defined by a set of orthogonal functions, the transformation and any<br>
subsequent processing within the transform domain preferably are performed separately<br>
for each block.<br>
[60] Thus, in the preferred embodiments a firame might be covered by a single<br>
block or, alternatively, might be covered by a plurality of equal-sized blocks. More<br>
preferably, as with the conventional techniques, there are only two block sizes: a large<br>
block size that covers an entire frame and a small block size resulting in a plurality of<br>
contiguous blocks that are uniformly distributed throughout the frame.<br><br>
[61] Moreover, in order to address boundary problems that otherwise would<br>
occur, as with the conventional techniques, the blocks of the present invention preferably<br>
overlap each other (e.g., in a manner satisfying the perfect reconstruction conditions).<br>
Conceptually, each block can be thought of as including a number of core samples that<br>
subsequently are to be processed (e.g., in module 19) and a number of boundary samples<br>
adjacent to such core samples. In the preferred embodiments, the core samples are new<br>
samples in the sequence and the boundary samples are historic samples from the<br>
preceding block. The frames, on the other hand, preferably are contiguous and non-<br>
overlapping. As a result, the block at tine beginning of a frame overlaps the preceding<br>
frame. For frames covered by a single block, that single block overlaps the entire<br>
preceding frame.<br>
[62] In addition to obtaining the data frame itself, step 202 also obtains a<br>
transient indicator (e.g., from transient detector 14). In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
obtained transient indicator indicates whether a transient is present in the current frame<br>
and, if so, where in the frame it is. If more than one transient has been detected in the<br>
current frame, then the location of each such transient preferably is obtained (e.g.,<br>
identified by and then received from transient detector 14). In order to simplify the<br>
explanation, the present disclosure sometimes assumes, without loss of generality, that<br>
only a single transient (if any) is detected in each frame.<br>
163] The actual detection of transients can be performed using, e.g., any<br>
existing techniques. Ordinarily, a transient will manifest itself as a spike in high-<br>
frequency components over a very short period of time and, therefore, can be detected on<br>
this basis. In any event, a threshold level often will be specified, below which signal<br>
activity will not be deemed a transient.<br>
[64] Referring back to Figure 16, in step 203 a determination is made as to<br>
whether a transient exists in the present frame. Preferably, this determination is<br>
straightforward based on the information provided by transient detector 14. If a transient<br>
is not present, then processing proceeds to step 205. If one is, then processing proceeds<br>
to step 210.<br>
[65] In step 205, the block size is set based on the determination that the<br>
present frame does not include a transient. In the preferred embodiments, a single block<br>
is used to cover the entire frame in such a case. More preferably, the block includes all<br>
of the samples in the current frame as the core samples, as well as part or all of the<br>
samples from the preceding frame(s). An exemplary block size is 2,048 samples, i.e.,<br><br>
1,024 core samples (frame size also being 1,024 samples) and 1,024 samples from the<br>
preceding frame.<br>
[661 Next, in step 207 the window function is selected for the current frame<br>
(assuming a single block is to cover the entire frame). In the preferred embodiments, this<br>
step involves evaluating the immediately preceding and immediately subsequent<br>
frames/blocks. Due to the increased number of window functions, as compared with<br>
conventional techniques, the determination of the appropriate window sequence typically<br>
is somewhat more complicated, but the underlying principle is relatively straightforward.<br>
Speciflcally, a fong window function is selected, with the specific shape depending on<br>
the existence and location of any transient in the previous and next frame. The specific<br>
selection preferably is made as follows:<br><br><br>
[67] On the other hand, if it were determined in step 203 that a transient exists<br>
in the current frame, then processing would have proceeded to step 210, in which the<br>
block size is set to "small". One example, for a frame size of 1,024 samples, is a block<br>
size of 256 samples, i.e., 128 core samples and 128 samples overlapping with the<br>
preceding block (so that the frame is covered by 8 blocks). Although the present<br>
embodiment contemplates a single block size for each of the two possible situations<br>
(transient / no transient), it should be noted that in other embodiments different block<br>
sizes may be selected based on any desired criteria, and a frame may consist of blocks of<br>
different sizes.<br>
[68] In any event, once the block size has been established, processing<br>
proceeds to step 212, in which different window functions are selected for the different<br>
blocks within the current frame. Because it is known that the current frame includes at<br>
least one transient, the WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF window function 100 will be used<br>
at least once (at the identified location(s)). More preferably, a sequence of brief and<br>
short window functions are selected for the short blocks of the current frame according<br>
to the following principles:<br>
•	WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF is applied to samples in the block where a<br>
transient occurs, in order to improve the temporal resolution of the block.<br>
•	The window function for the window that is immediately before the window<br>
that includes the transient has a designation of the form "... 2BRIEF".<br>
•	The window function for the window that is immediately after the window that<br>
includes the transient has a designation of the form "..._BRIEF2...".<br>
[69] Consequently, any of the following combinations of window functions is<br>
permissible:<br><br><br>
A specific procedure, written in C, for placing window functions within a frame is set<br>
forth in the section of this disclosure titled, "Window Function Selection Routine".<br>
Generally speaking, however, the pre-transient transitional window function is selected<br>
from the left column in the above table based on its own block length (long or short) and<br>
the nature of the window function immediately preceding it (long, short or brief).<br>
Similarly, the post-transient transitional window function is selected from the right<br>
column in the above table based on its own block length (long or short) and the nature of<br>
the window function immediately following it (long, short or brief). Each block within<br>
the current frame that is not (i) pre-transient (a block immediately preceding a transient<br>
block), (ii) transient (a block that includes a transient), (iii) post-transient (a block that<br>
immediately follows a transient block), (iv) the first block of the frame, or (v) the last<br>
block of the frame preferably is assigned a window function of<br>
WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SHORT 40. The first block in the current frame (assuming it is<br>
not a pre-transient, transient or post-transient block) preferably is assigned a window<br>
function of WIN_SHORT_priorWFSHORT, and the last block in the current frame<br>
(assuming it is not a pre-transient, transient or post-transient block) preferably is<br>
assigned a window function of WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SubsWF.<br>
[70] Upon completion of step 212, processing proceeds to step 17 to apply the<br>
selected window functions. Upon completion of step 17, processing returns to step 202<br>
to process the next frame.<br>
[71] It should be understood that the flow diagram shown in Figure 16<br>
primarily is conceptual in nature. In fact, as indicated above, the selection of window<br>
function(s) for one frame typically will be affected by the presence and location of<br>
transients in adjacent frames. Accordingly, the selection of window function(s) for one<br>
frame may be performed concurrently with the selection of window function(s) for one<br><br>
or more other frames. At the very least, the selection for a current frame preferably is in<br>
anticipation of the window function that will be applied to a subsequent frame.<br>
[72] It is noted that the portion 216 of the flow diagram shown in Figure 16<br>
can used in place of corresponding processing performed in conventional window-<br>
function selection module 16 (in Figure 1). As a resuh, the techniques of the present<br>
invention typically can be easily incorporated as an improvement to conventional<br>
systems.<br>
[73] One application in which the present invention may be used is for audio<br>
coding/decoding. Within such a system, the encoder typically indicates to the decoder<br>
the window frmction that it used to encode the current frame so that the decoder can use<br>
the same window function to decode the frame. With conventional techniques, only one<br>
window function index generally needs to be transmitted to the decoder to accomplish<br>
this purpose because:<br>
•	For a frame without a detected transient, only one of the long window<br>
functions is used, and hence needs to be indicated to the decoder.<br>
•	For a frame that includes one or more transients, all the window functions<br>
within the frame are the same, namely, WIN_SHORT_SHORT2SHORT 40.<br>
Such a frame 70 (which is sandwiched between two frames without a detected<br>
transient) is illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
[74] The statement above also is true for the technique of the present<br>
invention. That is, only one window function index needs to be transmitted to the<br>
decoder in order for the decoder to use the same window functions as the encoder to<br>
decode the frame. This is because:<br>
•	For a frame without a detected transient, the present technique also needs only<br>
to indicate to the decoder which one of the long window functions is used.<br>
•	For a frame with a detected transient, the encoder only needs to indicate to the<br>
decoder if there is a transient in the first block of the current frame and if there<br>
is a transient in the first block of the next frame; then, the sequence of window<br>
functions for the whole frame can be determined using the procedures<br>
described herein. Because the WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF window function<br>
100 is used for a block with a transient in the preferred embodiments, the<br>
following nomenclature may be used to convey this message:<br><br>
WIN_SHORT_CurrentSubs, where Current (SHORT=no, BRIEF=yes)<br>
identifies if there is transient in the first block of current frame, and Subs<br>
(SHORT=no, BRIEF=yes) identifies if there is transient in the first block of the<br>
subsequent frame. For example, WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF indicates that<br>
there is transient in the first block of the current frame and in the first block of<br>
the subsequent frame, and WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2SHORT indicates that there<br>
is transient in the first block of the current frame but not in the first block of the<br>
subsequent frame.<br>
[75] Figures 17-20 illustrate exemplary window function sequences according<br>
to the present invention. In each such sequence, a frame having at least one transient (as<br>
indicated by WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF window function 100) is surrounded by two<br>
frames on each side that do not include a transient. However, these examples are not to<br>
be taken as limiting; consecutive frames, each having at least one transient, also are<br>
allowed.<br>
Exemplary Implementation<br>
[76] One widely used window function is the following sine function:<br><br>
If M=L for long window function, M=S for short window function, and M=B for brief<br>
window function, where L&gt;S&gt;B, then the following window functions can be defined:<br><br>
WIN_LONG_SHORT2LONG:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[77] A good set of window length parameters is L=1024, S=128, and B=32.<br>
However, other parameters instead may be used.<br>
System Environment.<br>
[781 Generally speaking, except where clearly indicated otherwise, all of the<br>
systems, methods and techniques described herein can be practiced with the use of one or<br>
more programmable general-purpose computing devices. Such devices typically will<br>
include, for example, at least some of the following components interconnected with<br>
each other, e.g., via a common bus: one or more central processing units (CPUs); read-<br>
only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); input/output software and<br><br>
circuitry for interfacing with other devices (e.g., using a hardwired connection, such as a<br>
serial port, a parallel port, a USB connection or a firewire connection, or using a wireless<br>
protocol, such as Bluetooth or a 802. II protocol); software and circuitry for connecting<br>
to one or more networks (e.g., using a hardwired connection such as an Ethernet card or<br>
a wireless protocol, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), global system for<br>
mobile communications (GSM), Bluetooth, a 802.11 protocol, or any other cellular-<br>
based or non-cellular-based system), which networks, in turn, in many embodiments of<br>
the invention, connect to the Internet or to any other networks); a display (such as a<br>
cathode ray tube display, a liquid crystal display, an organic light-emitting display, a<br>
polymeric light-emitting display or any other thin-film display); other output devices<br>
(such as one or more speakers, a headphone set and a printer); one or more input devices<br>
(such as a mouse, touchpad, tablet, touch-sensitive display or other pointing device, a<br>
keyboard, a keypad, a microphone and a scanner); a mass storage unit (such as a hard<br>
disk drive); a real-time clock; a removable storage read/write device (such as for reading<br>
from and writing to RAM, a magnetic disk, a magnetic tape, an opto-magnetic disk, an<br>
optical disk, or the like); and a modem (e.g., for sending faxes or for connecting to the<br>
Internet or to any other computer network via a dial-up connection). In operation, the<br>
process steps to implement the above methods and functionality, to the extent performed<br>
by such a general-purpose computer, typically initially are stored in mass storage (e.g.,<br>
the hard disk), are downloaded into RAM and then are executed by the CPU out of<br>
RAM. However, in some cases the process steps initially are stored in RAM or ROM.<br>
[79| Suitable devices for use in implementing the present invention may be<br>
obtained from various vendors. In the various embodiments, different types of devices<br>
are used depending upon the size and complexity of the tasks. Suitable devices include<br>
mainframe computers, multiprocessor computers, workstations, personal computers, and<br>
even smaller computers such as PDAs, wireless telephones or any other appliance or<br>
device, whether stand-alone, hard-wired into a network or wirelessly connected to a<br>
network.<br>
[80] In addition, although general-purpose programmable devices have been<br>
described above, in alternate embodiments one or more special-purpose processors or<br>
computers instead (or in addition) are used. In general, it should be noted that, except as<br>
expressly noted otherwise, any of the functionality described above can be implemented<br>
in software, hardware, firmware or any combination of these, with the particular<br>
implementation being selected based on known engineering tradeoffs. More specifically.<br><br>
where the functionality described above is implemented in a fixed, predetermined or<br>
logical manner, it can be accomplished through programming (e.g., software or<br>
firmware), an appropriate arrangement of logic components (hardware) or any<br>
combination of the two, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
[81] It should be understood that the present invention also relates to machine-<br>
readable media on which are stored program instructions for performing the methods and<br>
functionality of this invention. Such media include, by way of example, magnetic disks,<br>
magnetic tape, optically readable media such as CD ROMs and DVD ROMs, or<br>
semiconductor memory such as PCMCIA cards, various types of memory cards, USB<br>
memory devices, etc. In each case, the medium may take the form of a portable item<br>
such as a miniature disk drive or a small disk, diskette, cassette, cartridge, card, stick<br>
etc., or it may take the form of a relatively larger or immobile item such as a hard disk<br>
drive, ROM or RAM provided in a computer or other device.<br>
[82] The foregoing description primarily emphasizes electronic computers and<br>
devices. However, it should be understood that any other computing or other type of<br>
device instead may be used, such as a device utilizing any combination of electronic,<br>
optical, biological and chemical processing.<br>
Additional Considerations.<br>
[83] Several different embodiments of the present invention are described<br>
above, with each such embodiment described as including certain features. However, it<br>
is intended that the features described in connection with the discussion of any single<br>
embodiment are not limited to that embodiment but may be included and/or arranged in<br>
various combinations in any of the other embodiments as well, as will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
[84] Similarly, in the discussion above, functionality sometimes is ascribed to<br>
a particular module or component. However, functionality generally may be<br>
redistributed as desired among any different modules or components, in some cases<br>
completely obviating the need for a particular component or module and/or requiring the<br>
addition of new components or modules. The precise distribution of functionality<br>
preferably is made according to known engineering tradeoffs, with reference to the<br>
specific embodiment of the invention, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[85] Thus, although the present invention has been described in detail with<br>
regard to the exemplary embodiments thereof and accompanying drawings, it should be<br><br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that various adaptations and modifications of the<br>
present invention may be accomplished without departing from the spirit and the scope<br>
of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to the precise embodiments<br>
shovvn in the drawings and described above. Rather, it is intended that all such variations<br>
not departing from the spirit of the invention be considered as within the scope thereof as<br>
limited solely by the claims appended hereto.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
