Description<br>
Electronic component and method for fixing the same<br>
The invention relates to an electronic component, especially a coil and a<br>
method for its manufacture.<br>
Coils with coil cores are often required in electronics. They are<br>
implemented and fixed in components, printed circuit boards or in other<br>
arrangements. Placement and fixing often takes place with the help of<br>
devices that grasp the coils and place them at the required place. After<br>
placing, they can, for instance, automatically be soldered to establish the<br>
electrical connection.<br>
When moving the coil with the help of automatic appliances very high<br>
speeds can occur and especially also jerky accelerations. Upon the<br>
occurrence of jerky accelerations the danger exists that the coil cores may<br>
be thrown out of the coil winding. Commonly, the coil cores are a bit<br>
longer than the coil winding, but grasping with automatic appliances<br>
generally occurs in the middle of the longitudinal extension of the coil -<br>
thus on the coil winding.<br>
To enable grasping on the coil winding, it is already known to attach a<br>
small plate made of plastic, with the help of an adhesive, which can involve<br>
an encapsulating material to be applied on the top side of the coil winding<br>
(DE 9410532).<br>
The task of the invention is to form an electronic component in such a<br>
manner that it is particularly suitable for automatic assembly.<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 2 -<br>
To solve this task, the invention proposes a component with the features<br>
mentioned in Claim 1 and/or a method with the features of Claim 11.<br>
Further developments of the invention are object of dependent claims.<br>
The component can by grasped by using a grasper on the holding element,<br>
and moved to the assembly point.<br>
The electronic component can be a capacitor, for example. Particularly, the<br>
invention is suitable for fastening coils.<br>
In the normal case the windings of the coil lie adjacent to one another in<br>
order to occupy little space as possible. Now, it is provided according to the<br>
invention that, at a point between two sections of winding or also between<br>
two adjacent windings, a gap is provided for instance in longitudinal<br>
direction of the coil. Through this gap the coil core is open outwards so that<br>
the holding element can be connected both with the coil core as well as<br>
with the two adjacent coil windings. The holding element made of plastic is<br>
injection-molded at this point. It connects itself with the coil core and with<br>
the neighboring windings. Through this, a permanent connection between<br>
the coil core and the coil winding established so that the initially mentioned<br>
difficulties can no longer occur.<br>
For an automatic assembly, the coils are generally formed such that they<br>
allow one to see which side of the coil is meant to be the assembly side on<br>
the printed circuit board. This can be identified, for instance, in that the two<br>
connection ends of the coil winding run tangentially to the coil core and lie<br>
in one plane. The invention now proposes that the holding element is<br>
injection-molded on the side turned away from the assembly side of the<br>
coil.<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 3 -<br>
Thus, expressed otherwise, this allows that the holding element is injection<br>
molded from this side. This results in that the holding element can also be<br>
used to form an action point for a gripping device, for instance for a suction<br>
pipette .<br>
According to the invention it can be provided in a further development that<br>
the holding element extends at least over a part of the circumference of the<br>
coil.<br>
In yet another further development of the invention it can be provided that<br>
the holding element only extends over a part of the length of the coil. Thus,<br>
the rest of the coil, particularly of the coil winding, remains free of the<br>
material of the holding element so that no restrictions occur with regard to<br>
the heat dissipation capability.<br>
It can, however, also be provided that the holding element extends over an<br>
entire circumference of the coil so that it is therefore injection-molded<br>
around the coil.<br>
In yet another further development of the invention, it can be provided that<br>
the holding element features a plane surface on the side turned away from<br>
the assembly side of the coil. This plane surface is meant and is suitable for<br>
being held by means of a grasper.<br>
According to the invention it can likewise be provided that the holding<br>
element is injection-molded from a plastic that develops an adhesive effect<br>
at higher temperatures, for instance at a temperature that corresponds to<br>
the soldering temperature. This leads to the effect that, during its electrical<br>
connection via the soldering process, the coil is concurrently additionally<br>
connected mechanically with the printed circuit board at a further point.<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 4 -<br>
For the manufacture of the coil, the invention proposes that first from the<br>
wire the coil winding is made in such a manner that said coil features a gap<br>
at least at one point between two adjacent windings in the longitudinal<br>
direction. Thereafter, in this coil winding, a coil core is inserted and the unit<br>
comprising the coil winding and the core is introduced into an injection die.<br>
In this injection die, many similar units of coil winding and coil core can be<br>
introduced. Finally, at the said point of the gap between the two windings<br>
and the two adjacent windings, the holding element itself is injection-<br>
molded.<br>
Further features, details, and preferences of the invention are derived from<br>
the claims and the abstract, whose wording refers to the content of the<br>
description, and to the following description of a preferred embodiment as<br>
well as to the drawing. The following figures show:<br>
Figure 1: a view of a coil winding with a coil core from the direction turned<br>
away from the assembly side of the coil;<br>
Figure 2: the view of the coil of Figure 1 from the bottom in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3: the view of the coil corresponding to Figure 2 with an attached<br>
holding element;<br>
Figure 4: an illustration corresponding to Figure 3 for the second<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 5: a plan view of a coil to be vertically mounted.<br>
Figure 6: a side view of the coil according to Figure 5 with a partially<br>
sectioned illustration of the holding element.<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 5 -<br>
Figure 1 shows a coil with a coil core 1, for instance made of ferrite. The<br>
coil core 1 is formed as a circular cylindrical rod. It contains two plane end<br>
faces 2. The coil core 1 is surrounded by a coil winding 3, which features<br>
numerous adjacent coil windings 4. The two ends 5, 6 of the coil winding 3<br>
are tangentially led away from the coil core 1. The two ends 5, 6 can also<br>
be longer, the illustration is only schematically considered. They lie in one<br>
plane. This plane depicts the assembly side of the coil.<br>
The windings 4 of the coil winding 3 are wound at a point 7 such that they<br>
feature a gap in the longitudinal direction of the coil. This forms a gap<br>
through which a part of the surface of the coil core 1 is visible.<br>
Figure 2 shows the view of the coil of Figure 1 from below in Figure 1, thus<br>
from a direction offset by 90°. Here, one sees how the gap between two<br>
adjacent windings 4 occurs. The pitch of the windings is enlarged at this<br>
point and finally led back to the normal value.<br>
The unit depicted in Figures 1 and 2 of the coil core 1 and coil winding 3 is<br>
placed in an injection die, together with a plurality of other similar units. In<br>
this injection die, a holding element 8 is injection-molded onto the point 7 of<br>
the gap between two adjacent windings 4 of the coil winding 3. The top side<br>
9 of the holding element 8 as visible in Figure 3 is formed plane. In<br>
longitudinal direction, the holding element 8 extends over the gap between<br>
adjacent windings and at least over the two adjacent windings themselves,<br>
preferably still up into the depression between the next windings. The<br>
holding element 8 is made of injected plastic and is connected with the<br>
core 1 and the coil windings. Through this the coil winding 3 is also<br>
connected with the core 1. As for the embodiment of Figure 3 the holding<br>
element 8 extends in the circumferential direction only via a part of the<br>
coil.<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 6 -<br>
Figure 4 depicts an embodiment in which the holding element 18 is<br>
injection molded around the entire circumference of the coil. Again, the<br>
side of the holding element 18 is turned away from the assembly side, at<br>
the bottom in Figure 4, where it is provided with a plane surface 9 on<br>
which a gripper can act.<br>
In the case of both embodiments the holding element 8, 18 only extends<br>
over a part of the length of the coil so that the rest of the coil windings 3<br>
remain free and can dissipate their heat content.<br>
The attachment of a holding element 8, 18 on an electronic component<br>
was described using a coil as an example. The attachment of such a<br>
holding element can also occur for other electronic components.<br>
The holding element 18 depicted in Figure 4 can be injection-molded from<br>
a plastic that develops an adhesive effect at a temperature corresponding<br>
to the soldering temperature. When the coil is placed on the printed circuit<br>
board and then finally soldered, with the help of the holding element 18 it<br>
will be bonded together with the surface of the printed circuit board. This<br>
leads to a particularly good mechanical safety of the coil on the printed<br>
circuit board. This type of connection by means of a holding element<br>
made of a plastic that generates an adhesive effect at a higher<br>
temperature can also find application for other electronic components, but<br>
not for coils with a coil core.<br>
What was depicted in Figures 1 to 4 for a horizontal configuration of coils is<br>
obviously also possible for the upright configuration of coils. In the case of<br>
horizontal configuration the axis of the coil core and the coil winding is<br>
aligned parallel to the surface on which the coil is mounted. In the case of<br>
upright configuration the axis is aligned perpendicularly to the surface.<br>
Even with the upright configuration  it is possible to align the  holding<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 7 -<br>
element as it is depicted in Figures 1 to 3. Even then can a grasper hold the<br>
contact surface 9 of the holding element and place the coil at the right<br>
place.<br>
It is, however, likewise possible to attach the holding element at a different<br>
point. This should be depicted with reference to Figure 5 and Figure 6.<br>
Figure 5 shows a face view of a coil in which the face surface 2 of coil core<br>
1 is visible. The two ends 5, 16 of the coil winding are arranged differently<br>
here contrary to how this was depicted in the preceding embodiments.<br>
While connection end 5 still runs tangentially to the coil core 1, the<br>
connection end 16 is aligned radially outwards and from there it is bent<br>
downwards; see the side view of Figure 6. Whilst Figure 5 still shows the<br>
coil with coil core prior to the injection molding of the holding element,<br>
Figure 6 shows a side view with a holding element 28 injection-molded on<br>
it, which is depicted here in a sectional view. As one can still derive from<br>
Figure 5, here the winding 4 sections of the coil winding are arranged such<br>
that the core 1 between them is free. One can injection mould a holding<br>
element 28 at this point which then extends laterally so far that it then<br>
overlaps the top-most coil winding 4. This also leads to having the coil<br>
winding 3 fixed against displacement on the core 1.<br>
The holding element 28 can enclose the face end of the coil, for instance,<br>
when turned away from the mounting surface around the entire<br>
circumference so that it forms a kind of cover. However, it can also be<br>
sufficient that this holding element 28 only extends in the section of a<br>
diameter above the face end, so that free parts remain on the right and<br>
left side.<br>
Also in the type of configuration of Figure 6, the holding element, in the<br>
embodiment according to Figure 4, can similarly reach up to a point on the<br><br>
P 45285 WO	- 8 -<br>
lower face surface 2 in Figure 6 if one intends to attain the same fixing<br>
type as in the case of the embodiment according to Figure 4.<br>
What was depicted with reference to Figures 4 to 6 as an example for one<br>
coil can also be applied to another electronic component, for instance, to<br>
capacitors that likewise feature connection ends, and in which the<br>
components can be mounted with both the help of a grasper as well as<br>
adhesion during soldering.<br><br>
