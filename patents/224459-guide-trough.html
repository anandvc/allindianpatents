				<td>The present invention relates to a guide trough.<br>
The invention relates to a guide trough for energy guiding chains, with elongated, parallel side elements that can be fastened on a substrate using fastening means, and a base on which the lower strand of an energy guiding chain can be deposited between the side elements in the longitudinal direction, where at least first recesses or projections for accommodating projections or recesses of a sliding rail for depositing the upper strand of the energy guiding chain are provided in the longitudinal direction of the side elements and opposite each other on the inner sides.<br>
Guide troughs of this kind are used to guide energy guiding chains, which serve to accommodate flexible supply lines. One specific field in this context is their use for long travel i paths,  such as occur in plant construction and materials handling, for example. In this context, an energy guiding chain is often deposited and removed in two layers, a lower strand and an upper strand, one above the other in the guide trough. In this context, it is particularly necesyary to guide the energy guiding chain precisely in the guide trough, since less precise guidance can lead to elevated wear, e.g. in the form of abraded particles, which act like emery in the energy guiding chain and in the guide trough, further increasing wear as a result, and can induce the risk of reduced mobility of the energy guiding chain. Furthermore, less precise guidance of the energy guiding chain can generate noise that may be rated as impermissible at the workplace.<br><br>
To. achieve precise guidance, DE 195 12 086 Cl, for example, proposes a guide trough for energy guiding chains of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph, which displays side elements that have a dimensionally stable hollow section and are assembled in sections at the ends, the sections being connected by connecting elements at the ends for more precise alignment. Moreover, a sliding rail, whose height can be adjusted in two steps, is proposed for depositing the upper strand, as is filling of the cavities in the hollow section with sound-absorbing material in order to muffle the noise. Although this already substantially improves the guide, it is in many cases still not satisfactory as regards abrasion and noise emission.<br>
Therefore, the object of the invention is to provide a guide trough that permits more precise guidance of the energy guiding chain.<br>
The object i-s solved in that a guide trough of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is designed in such a way that an inward-facing step is provided on the inner side of the side elements, which is integrally connected to the side element and extends over a section of the height of the side element below the first recess or projection and above the base, by which the inside dimension of the guide trough, i.e. the distance between1 opposite side elements, is reduced compared to the section of the height located above the step by twice the magnitude of the step and thus forms a narrower guide for the lower strand compared to the guide for the upper strand, and in that at least two second recesses or projections for accommodating projections or recesses of anti-sliding rails for lateral guidance of the energy guiding chain are provided, these being vertically separated, running in the longitudinal direction of the side elements, lying opposite each other on the inner sides and located above the step.<br>
Due to being provided below the first recess or projection for accommodating the sliding rail that accommodates the upper strand, the step is located to the side of the lower strand deposited in the guide trough. Owing to the step, the inside dimensions of the guide trough, i.e. the distance between the opposite side elements, is reduced by twice the magnitude of the step in comparison with the section of the height located above the step, this achieving closer and more precise guidance of the lower strand compared to the guidance of the upper strand.  In  this  context,  the  base  can,  in  different embodiments, serve as a sliding rail for the lower strand or as a support for the sliding rail that accommodates the lower strand. Moreover, a side element is provided with at least two second recesses or projections for accommodating anti-sliding rails, these being located above the step and thus above the. guide constricted by the step. Lateral guidance of the energy guiding chain is further improved as a result. For precise guidance, the anti'-sliding rails can, when installed and when an energy guiding chain is deposited in the guide trough, preferably be located along the upper lateral surface area of the upper strand and the lower strand of the energy guiding chain that faces the inner side of the side element.<br>
In a development of the invention, the step is formed by an offset in the side element. As a result, it takes little outlay to produce the step, whose offset has a strength-increasing effect in the more highly stressed, lower area of the side element, in particular, meaning that the guide rail becomes more dimensionally stable as a result, thus providing more precise guidance. This step is preferably not sharp-edged, but of gradually transitioning design.<br>
In a preferred development of the invention, the side element is manufactured as a sheet-metal section, where the step is formed by increasing the thickness of the material. This simple thickening again increases the strength of the lower area,<br>
meaning that it takes much less outlay to manufacture the side element as a sheet-metal section than as a hollow section. In this context, the sheet-metal section displays lateral pockets or indentations to form the first and second recesses. Obviously, an offset.and thickening are also conceivable for producing the step. Moreover, the side element displaying an offset can also be manufactured as a sheet-metal section. In addition, the side element is preferably made of aluminium.<br>
Furthermore, an embodiment of the invention is preferred in which the side elements each display a foot element, extending essentially horizontally inwards in installed position, by which the side element rests on the substrate. This angular design further stabilises the side element and improves its footing. In this context, the foot element can, as in DE 195 12 086 Cl, be designed as a hollow section, this further increasing stability.<br>
The anti-sliding rails can preferably display a mushroom-shaped cross-section, with a head including a plane top side for flat contact with an energy guiding chain, and with a foot that can be fastened in the associated second recess. As a result, the head of the anti-sliding rail projects from the groove when installed, thereby reducing the width of the guide trough between the anti-sliding rails. This achieves more precise guidance of the energy guiding chain. Guidance is further improved by the possibility of flat contact of the anti-sliding rail with the energy guiding chain. To minimise the friction between the energy guiding chain and the guide trough, the plane top side of the head should preferably be smooth. Furthermore, the side of the head facing the inner side of the side element should preferably rest against the inner side, this resulting in stable positioning of the anti-sliding rail.<br>
The foot of the anti-sliding rail can have a wider area in the form of a dovetail at the end, by means of which it can be<br>
snapped into an undercut of the associated second recess. As a result, the anti-sliding rail can be inserted into the second recess perpendicularly to the inner side and also in the longitudinal direction, the foot expanding to rest against the inner surface of the second recess, this achieving stable<br>
positioning  of  the  anti-sliding  rail  and  providing  the<br>
»<br>
possibility of levering the anti-sliding rail back out of the second recess.<br>
At least the head of the anti-sliding rail is preferably made of abrasion-resistant plastic. The plastic should preferably also have good mechanical damping properties in order to reduce noise generation.<br>
In an advantageous development, the width of the guide trough between the anti-sliding rails is greater than or equal to the width between the steps, this making it easier, for example, for the lower strand to pass through when traversing the energy guiding chain.<br>
For easier insertion of the energy guiding chain into the guide trough, the upper end area of the side elements can be designed in funnel-shaped form at an acute angle relative to the inner side of the side element.<br>
The first recess, and the sliding rail for insertion into it, are preferably of the design described in DE 197 15 012 Al.<br>
The fastening means can include at least one mounting bracket for laterally supporting the side elements and holding them down on the substrate, where the mounting bracket engages a mounting groove integrally moulded on the outer side of the side element by means of at least one, hook-shaped projection that is bent downwards in installed position, and can be fastened to the substrate. These hook-shaped projections are preferably arranged in such a way that they engage mounting<br>
grooves located in the upper area of the side elements. Particularly preferably, there are at least two projections. In this context, and particularly in the case of side elements made of sheet-metal sections, the mounting brackets serve to stiffen and thus stabilise the guide trough and to achieve more stable guidance of the energy guiding chain in the guide trough. To connect two abutting side elements, the mounting bracket can be located in the transitional area between these two side elements in order to permit more exact alignment of the two side elements relative to each other.<br>
For further stabilisation and fixation of the side elements on the substrate, the lower end of the side elements can display an inward-facing projection with an integrally moulded mounting groove on the top side, and the fastening means can include at least one clamping element for holding down and fastening the side elements on the substrate, where a tab of the clamping element engages the mounting groove over the projection of the side elements.<br>
Furthermore, the lower end of the side elements can display an outward-facing projection with an integrally moulded mounting groove on the top side, and the fastening means can include at least one clamping element for holding down and fastening the side elements on the substrate, where a tab of the clamping element engages the mounting groove over the projection of the side elements.<br>
Furthermore, the outer side of the side elements can display at least one recess or one projection, running in the longitudinal direction, for accommodating a fastening means, overlapping the butt ends of two adjacent side elements, in the form of an aligning element for aligning the butt ends of the side elements.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the recess is essentially open in<br>
the upward direction and displays an undercut into which the aligning element can be snapped by means of a tab.<br>
The aligning element also preferably includes a middle aligning section and, on at least one side facing in the longitudinal<br>
direction in installed position, a torsion spring section with<br>
a snap-in tab, by means of which the aligning element can be snapped into the recess. In this context, the aligning element can at the same time be clamped in the recess by the torsion spring section, meaning that the aligning element can only be displaced with difficulty in the longitudinal direction of the recess and is thus largely fixed in place in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Furthermore, the aligning element can display a tab that projects beyond the edge of the recess and serves as a point of application of force for pressing the aligning element into, or removing it from, the recess. In this context, the aligning element can be pressed into the mounting groove by hand and removed by means of a screwdriver-like tool, for example, which can be applied to the projecting tab from below.<br>
In a preferred development, the mounting groove for accommodating the aligning element displays a conical constriction of the cross-section towards the base of the groove, and the aligning element displays a corresponding, wedge-shaped taper. As a result, the aligning element can be clamped in the mounting groove in wedge fashion, where it can be held in this position due to the snap-in effect of its snap-in tab, in particular, this permitting particularly good fixation of the aligning element and thus particularly stable alignment of the side elements.<br>
Also preferred is an embodiment of the invention in which the recess for accommodating the aligning element for aligning the side elements is simultaneously the mounting groove for<br>
accommodating the hook-shaped projection of the mounting bracket that is bent downwards in installed position.<br>
In a development of the invention, the side elements can, for fastening on the substrate, be fastened, by means of further fastening means, on mounting rails with a C-section running transverse to the longitudinal direction of the guide trough.<br>
These further fastening means can be screw connections with abutments located in the C-section, where the opening in the C-section should face upwards for passing through the screws. As a result, after loosening the fastening means, the side elements can be displaced in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction and thus exactly aligned in this direction.<br>
In a development of the invention, the side element can be fastened to the C-rail 'on the inside and outside by means of clamping elements according to Claims  10 and 11,  where, particularly preferably, one of the clamping elements is joined in one piece to a base plate that passes, in the C-rail, underneath the side element and up to the screw connection of the other clamping element. This simplifies assembly, while simultaneously offering good fastening and alignment of. the side element on the C-section.<br>
The fastening means claimed in Claims 8 to 14, and explained in more detail in developments in the above description, permit exact alignment and fixation of the side elements, meaning that improved, precise guidance is achieved as a result, and thus constitute an autonomous solution of the object in hand.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of a practical example and associated drawings. The drawings show the following:<br>

Figure 14  A side view of the side element with the inserted aligning elements.<br>
Figures 1 to 6 show different views of two side elements 1 with various fastening means, a sliding rail 2 and two anti-sliding rails 3. Side elements 1 are shown assembled in abutting manner and connected by fastening means. Together with a further, parallel side element some distance away (not shown here), they form a guide trough for an energy guiding chain that can be deposited in the guide trough in an upper strand and a lower strand. In this context, sliding rail 2 is used for depositing the upper strand, and anti-siding rails 3 for lateral guidance of the energy guiding chain.<br>
Side elements 1 are made of profiled sheet metal. Side elements 1 display an upper section 4 and a foot element 5 that extends essentially horizontally inwards in installed position and by which side element 1 rests on C-sections extending perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. Moreover, a first recess 7 for accommodating sliding rail 2, and two second recesses 8 for accommodating two anti-sliding rails 3, are provided in upper section 4. As can be seen, in particular, in Figures 7 and 8 with the side view of side element 1, an inward-facing step 9 is located on the inner side of side elements 1 in the form of an offset 10 and thickening 11 of the<br>
material, extending over a section of the height of side element 1 below the lower, first recess 7 and above foot element 5.<br>
On the outer side in installed position, which is shown in Figures 1 and 3,  in particular,  upper section 4 of side elements 1 displays two mounting grooves 12, which are engaged by two parallel fastening means a distance apart in the form of mounting brackets 13, each with a projection 14 that is bent downwards in installed position, where two further fastening means in the form of aligning elements 15 are located in the connecting area of the two side elements 1 for connecting and aligning side elements 1. Mounting bracket 13 is additionally shown in a perspective top view in Figure 9, and aligning elements 15 are shown in various views in Figures 12a-e. Furthermore, in the foot area, side elements 1 display one outward-facing  and  one  inward-facing projection with  an integrally moulded mounting groove 16 on the top side. On the outside and on the inside, these mounting grooves 16 are engaged by fastening means in the form of clamping elements 17/18 for holding down and fastening side elements 1. These clamping  elements  17,  18  are  additionally  shown  in  a perspective top view in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. The outside mounting groove is additionally engaged by mounting bracket 13 with a correspondingly adapted projection 19 for holding down and fastening the side elements. One of the two clamping  elements,  clamping  element  18,  is  additionally equipped with an integral base plate 20.<br>
As particularly shown in enlarged section Z in Figure 6, anti-sliding rails 3 display a mushroom-shaped cross-section with a head 28 and a foot 29, where head 28 includes a plane top side 31 for making flat contact with the energy guiding chain, and foot 29 displays a wider area in the form of a dovetail. As a result, the anti-sliding rail can be inserted into, and fixed in, second recess 8 from the front or laterally. The flat<br>
contact with the energy guiding chain further improves the guidance of the energy guiding chain in the guide trough.<br>
Thus, Figures 1 to 3 show examples of various fastening and connecting methods for the two side elements 1 joined to each<br>
other at the face ends. For example, mounting bracket 12 for<br>
supporting, holding down and fastening the respective side element 1 acts from the outside, while clamping element 17 holds down side element 1 on the inside. At the same time, the fastening elements can, as indicated in the Figures by the projection of these fastening elements beyond the end area of side elements 1, act in the connecting area of two side elements 1, overlapping, and thus connecting, both end areas of side elements 1.<br>
Another method is shown in the illustrated connecting area of the two side elements 1, where two clamping elements 17, 18 act on mounting grooves 16 on both sides. Furthermore, as already mentioned above, the aligning elements fitted in upper mounting grooves 12 connect the two side elements. Instead of the different clamping elements 17, 18 shown here, it is also possible for two clamping elements 17 to act on both sides.<br>
Fastening means 13 and 17 additionally display hole 21, through which a further fastening means in the form of screw 22 can be passed for fastening fastening means 13, 17 to a substrate, as indicated on the right-hand side in Figure 1 by the omission of C-section 6. In another fastening method, fastening means 13, 17 and 18 are connected to the C-section either with an abutment, as in the case of mounting bracket 13 and clamping element 17, or, as in the case of clamping element 18, via associated base plate 20, which, as shown in the sectional view in Figure 5, is passed through the C-section for connection to clamping element 17. Opening 23 of C-section 6 faces upwards, so that the individual fastening elements 13, 17, 18 can, while still in unfixed condition, be displaced in the longitudinal<br>
direction of C-section 6, meaning that the face ends of side elements 1 and the side elements arranged parallel a distance apart in the guide trough can be optimally aligned.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 indicate schematically how aligning elements 15, shown separately in Figures 12a-e, can be inserted into<br>
4<br>
mounting grooves 12 from above in direction of insertion X. Aligning elements 15 each display a middle aligning section 24 and, on either side thereof, a torsion spring section 25 that is connected to aligning section 24 via an axis of torsion 32. Torsion spring section 25 additionally displays snap-in tab 26, which can be snapped into correspondingly shaped snap-in groove 27 in mounting groove 12.<br>
To accommodate the aligning element, mounting groove 12 additionally displays a conical constriction of the cross-section towards the base of the groove. Aligning section 24 has a corresponding, wedge-shaped taper. As a result, aligning section 24 can be clamped in mounting groove 12 in wedge fashion, where it can be held in this position,- particularly due to the snap-in effect of its snap-in tab 26, which is snapped into snap-in groove 27, this permitting particularly good fixation of the aligning element and thus particularly stable alignment of side elements 1. Aligning section 24 additionally displays tab 31, which projects beyond the edge of the recess and serves as a point of application of force for pressing aligning element 15 into, or removing it from, mounting groove 12.<br>
The various fastening and aligning methods illustrated show that, as a result, the side elements can be optimally aligned and fastened on a substrate in a manner adapted to .suit the individual application in such a way that particularly precise guidance of the energy guiding chain in the guide trough is possible.<br><br>
