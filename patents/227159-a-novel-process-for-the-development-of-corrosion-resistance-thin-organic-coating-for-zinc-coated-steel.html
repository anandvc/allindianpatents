				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for providing an enhanced corrosion<br>
resistant thin organic coating (TOC) for zinc coated steel and rust resistant zinc<br>
coated steel with a thin organic coating.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The out of the bath surface of zinc and zinc alloy coatings are highly susceptible<br>
to corrosion. Corrosion products formed on zinc coating are generally referred to<br>
as 'white rust'. Inorganic chromate passivation is usually applied directly after<br>
galvanizing in line to enhance the corrosion protection properties of zinc and zinc<br>
alloy. This technique is widely applied as an economical method of corrosion<br>
prevention.<br>
In recent past a new technology was developed in the post treatment of<br>
galvanized sheets known as "thin organic coating" (TOC) or "organic composite<br>
coating". This coating formulation contains both organic and inorganic<br>
compounds in the formulation.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 3,036,934 describes the organic coating formulation<br>
comprising water emulsion acrylic polymer and the soluble chromium which<br>
enhances the white rust resistance of the zinc and zinc alloy sheet substrate.<br>
The formulations enhance white rust resistance of the coating comparatively<br>
better than inorganic chromate passivation. However, it does not give lubricity<br>
properties. Furthermore, a desirable higher corrosion resistance is also not<br>
achievable by this formulation.<br>
Other US Patent Numbers 5,482,787 and 5,294,485 describe the organic coating<br>
formulation having improved corrosion resistance and weldability. These<br>
formulations describe the two steps coating application. The first step is coating<br>
of inorganic chromate layer followed by organic coating layer. The organic<br>
polymer layer is based on an epoxy resin and is baked at a higher temperature<br>
of 100-200° C.<br>
There is therefore, a need for a thin organic coating (TOC) formulation which will<br>
not only enhance the white rust resistance of the zinc and zinc alloy substrate<br>
but also provide anti-fingerprint resistance properties, superior lubricity and paint<br>
adhesion.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a zinc and zinc alloy<br>
substrate with enhanced white rust resistance properties.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a zinc and zinc alloy<br>
substrate with anti-fingerprint resistance and increased lubricity and weldability.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by using a combination of organic resins<br>
and soluble chromium compound which provide corrosion protection to the zinc<br>
coated steel and steel sheets. This protection mechanism is by the barrier effect<br>
of the organic resin and the self healing effect of the hexavalent chromium. The<br>
best physical barrier effect of organic resin layer can be made by using water<br>
soluble styrene acrylic resin and polyurethane together.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a zinc and zinc alloy<br>
substrate with anti-fingerprint resistance and increased lubricity and weldability.<br>
Ammonium dichromate is used as a chromium compound. It is important that<br>
the amount of total chromium on each side of the thin organic coated surface be<br>
held between 10 to about 30 mg/m2 for colourless chromate coating. Below 10<br>
mg/m2, only partial protection against white rusting can be obtained, while<br>
above 30mg/mg light yellow colour appears.<br><br>
It has been observed that 20 mg/m2 gives good corrosion protection with a resin<br>
coating weight of approximately 1000 mg/m2. Colloidal silica when added<br>
further enhances the corrosion resistance of the coating layer. Wax can be<br>
added to improve the lubrication property of the coating. Total dry coating<br>
weight can be in the range of 500 - 3000 mg / m2.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a process for providing an enhanced<br>
corrosion resistant thin organic coating for zinc coated steel, like zinc coated<br>
steel sheet, comprising the steps of: formulating a water soluble emulsion<br>
comprising a water based styrenated acrylic copolymer emulsion, polyurethane<br>
resin and rust preventive additives for use as white rust corrosion resistant<br>
coating by carrying out polymerizing reaction of acrylic monomers and redox<br>
initiators at a temperature of 75° C - 85º C for a period of 3 to 4 hours; cooling<br>
the formulation; adjusting the pH value of said styrenated acrylic copolymer to<br>
the range of 7 to 9; and applying the formulation on zinc and zinc alloy coated<br>
steel in a thin layer.<br>
The present invention enhances the white rust resistance of the galvanized steel<br>
sheet by the application of organic coating applied as post treatment. The<br>
organic coating formulation gives a thin, transparent colourless passivation<br>
coating on the sheet surface thereby maintaining the bright appearance of zinc<br>
surface. In addition to corrosion resistance, this organic coating also gives anti-<br>
fingerprint resistance, lubricity and weldability of the coated sheet. The basic<br>
coating composition comprises of water-soluble styrene acrylic polymer,<br>
polyurethane emulsion and soluble chromium. Colloidal silica and polyethylene<br>
wax can be added for further enhancing the corrosion resistance an improving<br>
the lubrication property of the coating.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The thin organic coating of the present invention provides an excellent corrosion<br>
resistance, paint adhesion, lubrication, anti-fingerprints properties and allows a<br>
practical level of grounding and weldability. The coating increases the life of<br>
sheet by the barrier effect of the organic layer. In addition, the rust preventive<br>
additives such as the soluble chromate and colloidal silica are added to the<br>
organic film which further improves the corrosion resistance of the coated steel<br>
sheet by the self healing effect of the chromium present in the formulation. The<br>
lubricant added to the organic film improves the lubricative property of the<br>
coated steel sheet during press-forming of the sheet. The thin layer of organic<br>
coating can be applied in the continuous galvanizing line in place of chromate<br>
coating or can be applied over the chromate coating. The detailed description of<br>
the coating formulation is given below.<br>
The organic film comprises styrene acrylic copolymer, polyurethane polymer and<br>
soluble chromium. Colloidal silica and polyethylene wax can be advantageously<br>
added.<br>
The monomers are selected from styrene, methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid,<br>
acrylic acid, itaconic acid, butyl acrylate, ethyl hexyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate.<br><br>
The redox initiators are selected from potassium persulphate, ammonium<br>
persulphate and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The rate of addition of monomers to the reactor is in the range of 45 minutes to<br>
one hour per 200 grams of the monomer mixture.<br>
The rate of addition of initiator and emulsifier mixture to the reactor is in the<br>
range of 45 minutes to one hour per 200 grams of the initiator emulsifier<br>
mixture.<br>
50 to 60 parts of styrene acrylic copolymer is mixed with the polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion of 25 to 35 parts. 5 to 10 parts of the chromate solution are added to<br>
the formulation.<br>
Colloidal silica of 4 to 8 parts are added to the formulation for further enhancing<br>
the corrosion resistance of the coating layer. 4 to 8 parts of polyethylene wax<br>
are added to the formulation to improve the lubrication property of the coating<br>
layer.<br>
The thin organic coating formulation as described in the present invention can be<br>
applied by dip coating, spray coating, roller coating on hot dip zinc and zinc alloy<br>
coated sheets.<br><br>
Water soluble styrenated acrylic copolymer emulsion for use as corrosion<br>
resistant thin organic coating on zinc coated steel sheets in the present invention<br>
has been developed carrying out polymerization reaction of acrylic monomers<br>
and redox initiators at a temperature range of 75 to 85° C for a period ranging<br>
from 3 to 4 hours, cooling the temperature and adjusting the pH value of the<br>
styrenated acrylic copolymer to the range of 7 to 9.<br>
The organic resins used in this formulation are water based styrene acrylic<br>
copolymers and polyurethane.<br>
The water based styrene acrylic copolymer formulation contains 38% of solid<br>
content. In the laboratory, the styrene acrylic copolymer (Example 1<br>
formulation) is adjusted in such a way that the formed copolymer gives 38% of<br>
solid content at the end of the reaction.<br>
Also, it is found that the styrene acrylic copolymer (Example 2 formulation) 45%<br>
of solid content and (Example 3 formulation) 50% of solid content give similar<br>
performance to Example 1 formulation. However, these two have to be<br>
dissolved in deionized water to make 38% of solid content and then used in the<br>
coating formulation.<br><br>
It has also been observed in the present invention that some of the commercially<br>
available styrene acrylic copolymer with the following properties: stabilization<br>
emulsifier, styrene acrylic monomers, approximately 50%, solid content,<br>
Brookfield viscosity 20 - 70 at 30°C Ps, pH 7.5 - 9, specific gravity approximately<br>
1.05 at 30°C, MFFT 15 - 18°C, may also be used as a part of the formulation to<br>
provide adequate coating performance.<br>
The water based Polyurethane resin used in this formulation contains<br>
approximately 25% solid content. The polyurethane resin used in this invention<br>
is of pH 6.5 to 7.5. It is a very soft dispersion of fine particle size.<br>
The colloidal silica used in this formulation contains 15 to 30% solid content.<br>
The average particle size is 4-15 mm and the pH of the solution is 9.5 - 10. Its<br>
density is 1.1. to 1.25 g/cm3.<br>
The polyethylene wax emulsion used in this formulation is a - white translucent<br>
emulsion having 34 - 36 % solid content, pH 8.0 - 10.5 with typical particle size<br>
of 0.6 microns. The Drop point of the wax component is 138°C and hardness of<br>
wax is 0.5 maximum dmm.<br>
The thin organic coating formulation after applying on the sheet surface gives a<br>
dry coating weight of 500 - 3000 mg/m2. The thin organic formulation after<br>
applying on sheet surface gives a total chromium weight of 10-30 mg/m2 per<br>
side.<br><br>
The preparation of acrylic resin and the formulation of thin organic coating<br>

silica and the wax used in the present investigation are described below as<br>

and stirred for 3 hours continuously.<br>
COATING APPLICATION<br>
The above formulations were used for the passivation of the zinc coated steel<br>
sheet. The hot dip galvanized steel sheet was used for the above passivation.<br>
The coating was applied by passing the zinc-coated sheet through the thin<br>
organic coating formulation. A thin uniform layer of the coating was formed on<br>
the sheet surface. It was then passed through a set of squeeze roll and the<br>
coating layer was dried in a heating oven at a peck metal temperature of 50 -<br>
80°C. It Is important that the amount of chromate in the coated surface be held<br>
in the range of 10 to 30 mg/m2 for colourless chromate coating. Below 10<br>
mg/mg2, only the partial protection against white rusting was obtained, while<br>
above 30mg/m2 light yellow colour appeared. It was found that the 20 mg/m2<br>
showed good corrosion protection with a resin coating weight of approximately.<br>
In all the formulations, the organic coating weight was kept approximately 1000<br>
mg/m2 with a total chromium of approximately 20 mg/m2 on each side of the<br>
sheet surface.<br><br>
Corrosion Test<br>
The samples of examples 1 to 4 were tested under salt spray test. Specimens of<br>
size 150 x 100 mm were taken for salt spray test. The edges of the sheet were<br>
covered by lacquer to prevent the galvanic corrosion from the edges. Salt spray<br>
test was done in 5% sodium chloride solution as per ASTM B117. The sample<br>
evaluation was done after an interval of 24 hours. The thin organic coating<br>
coated samples passed 100 150 hours of salt spray resistance in term of 10%<br>
white rust appearance.<br>
Friction Test:<br>
The lubrication property on sheet was measured by sheet to die friction test. A<br>
constant sliding speed of 150 mm/min. and a sliding distance of 20 mm were<br>
used in all the experiments. Both the static and dynamic coefficients of friction<br>
were measured. It was found that the application of thin organic coated coating<br>
on minimum spangle galvanized sheet reduces the friction of coefficient. The<br>
coefficient of friction for minimum spangle hot-dip galvanized sheet was<br>
approximately 0.2 µm where as the coefficient of friction for thin organic coating<br>
coated minimum spangle hot-dip galvanized sheet was approximately 0.1 µm.<br>
The lower coefficient of friction improves the lubricity properties of the thin<br>
organic coating coated sheet.<br><br>
Anti Finger Properties<br>
Handling of the product results in fingerprints, an excellent anti-fingerprint<br>
property is imperative. The synthetic sweat formulation (Volvo method) used to<br>
evaluate the anti-finger property. Drop of synthetic swear was poured in the<br>
sheet surface kept in horizontal condition for an hour and then was washed out.<br>
The dullness of the surface was visually observed to measure the anti-finger<br>
properties. It was found that the samples give a satisfactory performance and<br>
no dullness was observed on the sheet surface.<br>
Paint Adhesion test:<br>
The compatibility of the thin organic costing coated product with the powder<br>
coating was examined. The samples was pretreated by conventional method<br>
and then powder coated. The powder coating thickness was approximately 60<br>
µm. The following test was performed the examine the adhesion properties of the<br>
powder-coated samples.<br>
Impact Test: A load of 980 grams was impacted on the samples from a distance<br>
of 110 cm. and it was visually observed with magnifier for paint crack. No<br>
cracking was observed on or around the impact produced dimples and the<br>
sample considered as pass the test.<br>
Conical Bend Test: The thin organic coating coated samples was manually bent<br>
over the cylindrical rod having one end diameter of 6.4 mm. The panel was<br>
bend approximately 180°C around the mandrel at a uniform velocity in a time of<br>
1 s. No cracking was observed in the test sample after the test. The samples<br>
considered as pass the test.<br><br>
