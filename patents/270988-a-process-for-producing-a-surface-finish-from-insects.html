				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A Process for Producing a Surface Finish<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a process for producing a surface finish from natural products having a lustrous surface with a gloss of various colors whose size can be selected to be large or small pieces as required and not easily broken, wherein the process is the utilization of natural characteristics and does not cause detrimental effects on the environment.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing a surface finish from natural products of a hard, brittle, lustrous nature with a gloss of various colors and not being easily broken.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
From the past to the present time man has created a variety of arts with different purposes such as for enhancing emotions, paying homage to one's creed. Therefore, there are many creative works in different forms of various arts. One of these creative works includes the finishing of the surface of materials, equipment or any objects by means of various methods such as surface etching, decoration of designs, printing, etc. One of the preferred methods is the application of materials to decorate surfaces. These materials are usually called surface finishes.<br>
Surface finishes which are preferably used are latural products such as plants or animals. For<br><br>
example, the application of lustrous materials with a gloss of various colors on their surface. However, such materials usually have weak points in that they are highly brittle and apt to break.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a process for producing a surface finish from natural lustrous materials with a gloss of various colors which usually has high fragility and is apt to break whereby the invention aims to improve these weak points and this can be achieved by appropriate adaptation.<br>
Materials suitable for use in the process of this invention should be of a high lustrous nature with a gloss of various colors. Preferably, these materials are obtained from insects that are usually chosen from hard-winged insects such as metallic wood-boring beetles in the family Buprestidae, of the order Coleoptera or other insects having the same characteristics.<br>
The parts of these insects that should be used are their heads, bodies, joints or the undersides part of abdominal segments. The more suitable parts are wings because their sizes are appropriate and can be used in a variety of works. Although these insects have a short life cycle, it is not a reason why these insects are taken for use in this invention to produce a surface finish in any respect.<br>
By the nature of the invention to conserve the nature, the present invention aims at insects that die naturally which also provides added value. According to<br><br>
researches, it has been found that a surface finish produced by the production process of this invention, by using various parts of insects that die naturally, will give a better result than using insects which do not die naturally. That is to say, the surface finish has a better gloss and is more lustrous and have property of increased resistance to breakage. Without being referred to any theories, the insects appropriate for use should be insects die naturally after reproduction. Usually,  they are of approximately 9 months to 1 year old after hatching. Therefore, to achieve the purpose of this invention, it shall be of certainty that the insects die naturally which can be found from the specific nature of this invention only.<br>
As an embodiment of this invention, said dead insects must be completely dried first which may be optional to carry out by many methods such as by sunlight or by dry heat with temperatures not too high to decompose insects or the required parts of such insects, for example, at temperatures around 30-40 degrees Celsius for about 1-2 days although the drying time may be longer than this depending upon the types of insects and other conditions.<br>
In addition, a method may be selected to decompose the tissues underneath the surface of said surface finish which can be observed by the change of color of said surface finish piece from brown to black. This can be carried out without using any chemicals by removing the tissues with the application of suitable force such as the pressure from machinery or if necessary,  from tool.  In the present invention, it has<br><br>
found that if the age of an insect is not appropriate and the insect is not dried properly in accordance with the invention, these tissues cannot be removed from the insect parts without breaking them.<br>
In this invention, it has also been found that the obtained thickness of a surface finish will affect the reflection of light and in turn affect its luster and gloss of colors, wherein its appropriate thickness is 0.1-1.5 mm, and more preferably is 0.5-1.0 mm.<br>
When the desired thickness is obtained, it	is<br>
optional that the  surface  finish may be divided	by<br>
cutting into pieces of various sizes as required for	an<br>
application.<br>
The product produced in accordance with the process of this invention can be used solely in finishing the surface of any material, equipment or tools or together with other materials such as Lygodium flexuosum vine, rattan, bamboo or precious metal such as gold or together with any arts.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.	A process for producing a surface finish<br>

5	wherein step (3) is carried out by applying force to<br>
remove said tissues.<br>
7.	A process according to any of claims 1 to<br>
6	wherein it is optional to carry out step (3) to make<br>
said surface finish to have a thickness of 0.1-1.5 mm.<br>
8.	A process according to any of claims 1<br><br>
to 7 wherein it is optional to carry out step (3) to make said surface finish to have a thickness of 0.5-1.0 mm.<br>
9.	A process according to any of claims 1 to 8 wherein it is further optional to divide said surface finish by cutting into pieces of various sizes as required.<br>
10.	A product obtained from the production process according to any of claims 1 to 9.<br>
