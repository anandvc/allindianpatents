				<td>This invention relates to a curing unsaturated polyester resin composition.<br>
This Application claims priority from-Provisional Application S/N 60/034,519, filed December 30, 1996.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a) Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to compositions classified in the art of chemistry as new and novel peroxyoxalates of Structure A that are preparable by reaction of hydroxy-<br>
-1A-<br><br><br>
[The definitions of Q, R1, R2, R3 and Z are given in the SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]<br>
hydroperoxides, such as 3-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylbutyl hydroperoxide and 3-hydroxy-l,1-dimethylpropyl hydroperoxide, with oxalyl halides and alkyl halooxalates, such as ethyl chlorooxalate, in the presence or absence of inorganic or organic bases, as well as processes for the preparation and use of the novel peroxyoxalates of Structure A. The peroxyoxalates of Structure A possess inherent applied use characteristics rendering them useful as reaction intermediates and as initiators for polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers and for curing of unsaturated polyester resins.<br>
There is a need in the polymer industries for efficient, free-radical initiators for polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers at lower temperatures in order to attain higher molecular weight polymers having improved tensile and other mechanical properties and/or to increase rates of<br>
-2-<br><br>
polymerizations in order to produce current polymers at higher rates of production. In the case of the latter scenario, the more efficient free-radical initiators enable polymer producers to increase productivity without need to build new and expensive production facilities. There also is a need in the polyester industry for free-radical initiators that cure unsaturated polyester resins faster and/or at lower temperatures. The inherent applied use characteristics of the new and novel peroxyoxalate compositions of Structure A of this invention are capable of satisfying these polymer industry needs. b) Description of the Prior Art P.D, Bartlett, et al. (J. Am. Cham. Soc, 82, 1762-8, 1960} described the decomposition kinetics of di-t-butyl diperoxyoxalate in solution and found its half-life at 60°C in benzene to be 6.8 minutes. In a subsequent paper P.D. Bartlett and R.E. Pincock (J. Am, Chem. Soc, 82, 1769-73, 1960) disclosed the decomposition kinetics of di-t-butyl diperoxyoxalate and several OO-t-butyl O-alkyl monoperoxyoxalates including OO-t-butyl O-ethyl monoperoxyoxalate and OO-t-butyl O-benzyl monoperoxyoxalate. Based on the<br>
-3-<br><br>
data provided in this reference the 10 Hr half-life temperatures (i.e., the temperature at which 50% of the peroxide is decomposed in 10 hours) were calculated to be 26°c, 39°C and 41°C, respectively, for the above peroxyoxalates, Thus, di-t-alkyl diperoxyoxalates have 10 Hr half-life temperatures, of about 25°C whereas OO-t-alkyl O-alkyl monoperoxyoxalates have 10 Hr half-life temperatures of about 40°C. An OO-t-alkyl O-alkyl monoperoxyoxalate of the instant invention, i.e., O-ethyl<br>
OO-(3-ethoxycarbonylcarbonyloxy-l,1-dimethylbutyl) monoperoxyoxalate (1-1) ,<br><br>
was found to have a 10 Hr half-life temperature of 25°C in trichloroethylene. Hence, the novel OO-t-alkyl O-alkyl monoperoxyoxalates of the instant invention are significantly more active than the OO-t-alkyl O-alkyl monoperoxyoxalates of the art.<br>
R.A. Sheldon and J.K. Kochi (J. Org. Chem. , 15<br>
-4-<br><br>
1223-6, 1970) reported on the rates of decompositions of various di-t-alkyl diperoxyoxalates of the structure,<br><br>
(where R is methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and benzyl)<br>
The data were consistent with those of Bartlett.<br>
W. Adams and J. Sanabia (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 99, 2735-9, 1977) describe the synthesis of a cyclic diperoxyoxalate,<br>
7,7,10,10-tetramethyl-1,2,5,6-tetraoxa-3,4-dioxocyclo-decane, from oxalyl chloride and<br>
2,5-dimethyl-2,5-dihydroperoxyhexane in the presence of pyridine. Based on the data provided in this reference the 10 Hr half-life temperature of the cyclic diperoxyoxalate was calculated to be about<br>
80°C.<br>

NOVEL Peraxyoxalate Compositions of Structure A<br>
Utility<br>
A. Polymeruzation of Ethylinically unsaturated<br>
Monomers<br>
In the free-radical polymerizations of ethylenically unsaturated monomers at suitable temperatures and pressures the novel peroxyoxalate compositions of Structure A. of this invention were found to be effective initiators with respect to efficiency (reduced initiator requirements, etc.), Ethylenically unsaturated monomers include olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, chlorostyrenes, bromostyrenes, vinylbenzyl chloride, vinylpyridine and divinylbenzene; diolefins, such as l,3-butadiene, isoprene and chloroprene; vinyl esters, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl laurate, vinyl benzoate and divinyl carbonate; unsaturated nitriles, such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile,- acrylic<br>
-25-<br><br>
acid and methacrylic acid and their anhydrides, esters and amides, such as acrylic acid anhydride, allyl, methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, glycidyl, lauryl and 2-ethylhexyl acrylates and methacrylates, and acrylamide and methacrylamide, maleic anhydride and itaconic anhydride, maleic, itaconic and fumaric acids and their esters; vinyl halo and vinylidene dihalo compounds, such as vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride and vinylidene fluoride; perhalo olefins, such as tetrafluoroethylane, hexafluoropropylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene; vinyl ethers, such as methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether and n-butyl vinyl ether; allyl esters, such as allyl acetate, allyl benzoate, allyl ethyl carbonate, triallyl phosphate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl glutarate, diallyl adipate, diallyl carbonate diethylene glycol bis {allyl carbonate) (i.e., ADC); acrolein; methyl vinyl ketone, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Temperatures of Q°C to 100°C, preferably 20°C to 90°C, more preferably 30°'C to 75°C and levels of peroxyoxalates of Structure A (on a pure basis) of 0.002 to 10% or more, preferably 0.005% to 2%, more preferably 0.01% to 1% by weight based on monomer, are normally employed in conventional polymerizations and copolymerizations of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The novel peroxide compositions of this invention can be used in combination with other free-radical initiators such as those disclosed at the bottom of column 4 and the top of column 5 of U.S.<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
Patent 4,525,308. Using the peroxide compositions of this invention in combination with these initiators adds flexibility to the processes of polymer producers and permits them to "fine tune" their polymerization processes.<br>
B. Curing of Unsaturated Polyester Resins<br>
In the curing of unsaturated resin compositions by heating at suitable curing temperatures in the presence of free-radical curing agents, the novel peroxyoxalate compositions of Structure A of this invention exhibit enhanced curing activity in the curable unsaturated polyester resin compositions. Unsaturated polyester resins that can be cured by the novel peroxyoxalate compositions of this invention usually include an unsaturated polyester and one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
The unsaturated polyesters are, for instance, polyesters as they are obtained by esterifying at least one ethylenically unsaturated di- or polycarboxylic acid, anhydride or acid halide, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaconic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid, allylmalonic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, and others, with saturated and unsaturated di- or polyols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediols, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-butanediols, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol, 2 -hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, 2-buten-1,4-diol, 2-butyn-l,4-diol,<br>
-27-<br><br>
2,4,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol, glycerol, penta-erythritol, mannitol and others. Mixtures of such di-or polyacids and/or mixtures of such di- or polyols may also be used. The di- or polycarboxylic acids may be partially replaced by saturated di- or polycarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid, succinic acid, sebacic acid and other, and/or by aromatic di-or polycarboxylic acids, such as phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. The acids used may be substituted by groups such as halogen. Examples of such suitable halogenated acids are, for instance, tetrachlorophthalic acid, tetrabromophthalic acid, 5,6-dicarboxy.<br>
1,2,3,4,7,7-hexachlorobicyclo(2.2.1)-2-heptene and others.<br>
The other component of the unsaturated polyester resin composition, the polymerizable monomer or monomers, can preferably be ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, chlorostyrenes, bromostyrenes, vinylbenzyl chloride, divinylbenzene, diallyl maleate, dibutyl fumarate, triallyl phosphate, triallyl cyanurate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl fumarate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, and others, or mixtures thereof, which are copolymerizable with said unsaturated polyesters.<br>
A preferred unsaturated polyester resin composition contains as the unsaturated polyester<br>
-28-<br><br>
component the esterification product of<br>
1,2-propanediol (a polyol), maleic anhydride (an<br>
anhydride of an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid) and<br>
phthalic anhydride (an anhydride of an aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acid) as well as the monomer component,<br>
styrene.<br>
Other types of unsaturated polyester resin compositions can be cured using the novel peroxide compositions of this invention as curing catalysts. These resins, called unsaturated vinyl ester resins, consist of a vinyl ester resin portion and one or more polymerizable monomer components. The vinyl ester resin component can be made by reacting a chloroepoxide, such as epichlorohydrin, with appropriate amounts of a bisphenol such as Bisphenol A [2,2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane], in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydroxide, to yield a condensation product having terminal epoxy groups derived from the chloroepoxide. Subsequent reaction of the condensation product with polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, in the presence or absence of acidic or basic catalysts, results in formation of the vinyl ester resin component. Normally, styrene is added as the polymerizable monomer component to complete the preparation of the unsaturated vinyl ester resin composition.<br>
Temperatures of about 20°C to 200°C and levels of novel peroxyoxalates of Structure A. of about 0.05% to 5% or more, preferably 0.10% to 4%, more preferably<br>
-29-<br><br>
0.25% to 3% by weight of curable unsaturated polyester resin composition are normally employed.<br>
The unsaturated polyester resin compositions described above can be filled with various materials, such as sulfur, glass, carbon and boron fibers, carbon blacks, silicas, metal silicates, clays, metal carbonates, antioxidants (AO's), heat, ultraviolet (UV) and light stabilizers, sensitizers, dyes, pigments, accelerators, metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, blowing agents, nucleating agents and others.<br>
C. Curing of Allyl Dialycol Carbonate (ADC.) Resins<br>
In the curing or polymerizing of diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) (ADC),<br><br>
by heating ADC monomer at suitable curing temperatures in the presence of free-radical curing agents, the novel peroxyoxalate compositions of Structure A of this invention exhibit enhanced curing or polymerizing activity for ADC monomer compositions. ADC was introduced commercially as CR-39 monomer (CAS Reg. No. 142-22-3) by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (PPG) and is produced by reacting diethylene glycol bis(chloroformate) with allyl alcohol in the presence of alkali (R. Dowbenko, in J.I. Kroschwitz and M. Howe-Grant, eds., Kirk-Othmer - Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, "Allyl Monomers and Polymers,"<br>
-30-<br><br>
Fourth Edition, Vol. 2, Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1992, pp 163-168). The ADC monomer can cured or polymerized alone or with other co-monomers such as such as acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters, allyl esters, diallyl dicarboxylates (e.g., diallyl phthalate), maleic anhydride and other monomers to produce clear castings or lenses that are transparent, tough, break-resistant and solvent-resistant. Curing or polymerizing of ADC monomer compositions are carried out in bulk (no solvent present). In general, curing or polymerizing of ADC monomer compositions to form cast sheets or lenses is carried out in two stages. The first stage involves the major part of the polymerization and occurs in the presence of the curing initiator, usually a lower dialkyl peroxydicarbonate, at temperatures of 35°C to 120°C. Curing or polymerization times vary from about 5 hours to 50 hours. Generally a time-temperature profile is employed in the first stage. An example of a time-temperature profile is given below:<br>
-31-<br><br>
TYPICAL CURE TEMPERATURE SCHEDULE FOR CURING OF ADC<br>
TIME (HOURS)	TEMPERATURE (°C)<br>
0.0	61<br>
1.0	62<br>
3.0	64<br>
7.0	68<br>
8.0	69<br>
8.5	74<br>
9.0	79<br>
9.5	86.5<br>
10.0	96.5<br>
10.5	115<br>
10.75	85<br>
11.0	60<br>
11.25	40<br>
11.5	30<br>
The second stage of the curing or polymerizing of ADC monomer compositions involves post-curing or annealing of the ADC resin for one to several hours at 100°C to 150°C. An example of post-curing of the ADC resin would be 2 hours at 115°C.<br>
Levels of the novel peroxyoxalate compositions of about 1% to 6% or more, preferably 2% to 5%, more preferably 2.5% to 4% by weight of curable or polymerizable ADC monomer composition, are normally employed.<br>
The ADC resin compositions described above can be filled with various materials, such as antioxidants (AO's), heat, ultraviolet (UV) and light stabilizers, tints, photochromic additives and dyes. In addition, the ADC resin compositions can contain additives such as acrylic polymers and the anti-shrink, low molecular weight acrylic resins disclosed in US Patent 4,217,433. Such<br>
-32-<br><br>
anti-shrink additives are employed to counter the 14% shrinkage that occurs when ADC monomer is polymerized.<br>

A major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band was present at 1791.1 cm-1, a major oxalate carbonyl band was present at 1741.6 cm-1 and a peroxide (-OO-} band was present at about 860 cm-1. The product had a rapid heat test [J. Chem. Ed. 48, A451 (1970)] result of 62°C which confirmed that the product was a very low temperature peroxide. The product contained 4.77% active oxygen (theory, 4.79%) according to a peroxyester active oxygen method, therefore, the assay of the product was 99.6% and the corrected yield was 100%.<br>

A 250 mL 3-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, a thermometer and an addition funnel and cooled with an ice bath was charged with 38.1 g (300 mmoles) of oxalyl chloride and 80 mL of MTBE. The flask contents were then cooled to 1°C. Then 4.3 g (30 mmoles) of dry 94.4% 3-hydroxy-l,1-dimethylbutyl hydroperoxide and 9.5 g of methoxyethyl ether (diglyme) in 20 mL of MTBE were slowly added to the the flask contents over a period of 30 minutes at 1°C. The diglyme was employed as a safety diluent for the product. Then the reaction mass was further stirred for 120 minutes at 0°C after which the MTBE and excess oxalyl chloride were removed in vacuo using a water aspirator at 0°C leaving 23.5 g (&gt;100% of theory, uncorrected; expected yield = 19 g of diglyme diluted product) of a slightly yellow liquid. An IR spectrum of the product showed only a trace of an OH band in the 3500 cm-1 region. A major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band was present at 1790 cm-1 and a major oxalate carbonyl band was present at about 1750 cm-1. The product had a rapid heat test result of 66°C which confirmed that the product was a very low temperature peroxide.<br>
Based on the method of preparation, crude yield data, rapid heat data and infrared spectral data the product<br>
-35-<br><br>
obtained in this reaction was the desired title product.<br>
A second preparation of the title peroxide was carried out in a similar manner except that only 4.0 g of diglyme safety diluent was employed. In this experiment 16.8 g (&gt;100% of theory, uncorrected; expected yield = 13.5 g of diglyme diluted product) of a slightly yellow liquid product was obtained. An IR spectrum of the product showed only a trace of an OH band in the 3500 cm-1 region. A major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band was present at 1795 cm-1 and a major oxalate carbonyl band was present at about 1750 cm-1. The product had a rapid heat test result of 63°C (loud pop) which again confirmed that the product was a very low temperature peroxide.<br>
The desired peroxide product was prepared in this experiment based on the method of preparation, crude yield data, rapid heat data and infrared spectral data that were obtained.<br>
A third preparation of the title peroxide was carried out in a similar manner except that no diglyme safety diluent was employed. In this experiment 9.5 g (100% of theory, uncorrected; expected yield = 9.5 g of undiluted product) of a slightly yellow liquid product was obtained. An IR spectrum of the product showed only a trace of an OH band in the 3500 cm-1 region, a major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band at about 1795 cm-1 and a major oxalate carbonyl band at about 1750 cm-1. The product had a rapid heat test result of 51°C which again confirmed that the product was a very low temperature peroxide.<br>

Example 3 Preparation of O-Ethyl<br>

A 250 mL 3-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, a thermometer and an addition funnel and cooled with an ice bath was charged with 2.8 g (60 mmoles) of ethanol, 3.4 g (43 mmoles) of dry pyridine and 60 mL of MTBE. The flask contents were cooled to 0°C. Then to the resulting vigorously stirred solution at 0°C was slowly added 4.8 g (15 mmoles) of 1,3-dimethyl-3-(chlorocarbonylcarbonylperoxy)butyl chlorooxalate (1-2) in 10 mL of MTBE. After the addition was completed the reaction mass was stirred for 60 minutes at 2°C after which 20 mL of water is added and the reaction mass was stirred an additional 5 minutes at 3-4°C. The aqueous layer was then separated and the organic layer was washed three times with 35 mL portions of aqueous 5% HC1 solution and then twice with 50 mL portions of water. The product solution was dried over 5% by weight of anhydrous MgSO4, and, after separation of the spent desiccant by filtration, the solvent was removed in vacuo using a water aspirator/vacuum pump at 0°C leaving 3.6 g (72% of theory, uncorrected) of a colorless liquid. An IR spectrum of the product showed a slight OH band in the 3500 cm-1 region, a major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band at 1791.1 cm-1 and a major oxalate carbonyl band was present at 1741.6 cm-1. There was a peroxide (-00-) band at about 860 cm-1. The<br>
-37-<br><br>
product had a rapid heat test result of 60°C which confirmed that the product was a very low temperature peroxide.<br>
Based on the method of preparation, yield data, rapid heat data and infrared spectral data the product obtained in this reaction was the desired title product, I-1. The IR spectrum of the product from this example was exactly the same as the IR spectrum of the product from Example 1.

A 125 mL flask was charged with 9.3 g (100 mmoles) of 97% t-butyl hydroperoxide, 75 mL of pentane and 3 g of anhydrous MgSO4 at room temperature. The contents were stirred for 30 minutes after which the contents were filtered and the spent dessicant was washed with 25 mL of pentane and the pentane washings were combined with the filtrate. A 3-neck flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, a thermometer and an addition funnel and cooled with a ice-water bath was then charged with 25.4 g (200 mmoles) of oxalyl chloride and 25 mL of pentane. The solution was cooled to 0°C. Then the dry pentane solution of t-butyl hydroperoxide was added slowly to the stirred oxalyl chloride/pentane solution over a period of 60 minutes at 0°C.

An IR spectrum of the product showed a very slight OH band in the 3500 cm"1 region and a single, major monoperoxyoxalate carbonyl band at 1797 cm"1. The product had a rapid heat test result of 45°C (very loud pop) which confirmed that the product, t-butylperoxy chlorooxalate, was a very low temperature peroxide. Impact shock testing [J. Chem.

The flask contents were cooled to 0°C. Then to the resulting vigorously stirred solution at 0°C was slowly added a solution of 7.7 g (21.0 mmoles) of about a 50% diglyme solution of t-butylperoxy chlorooxalate in 10 mL of MTBE. After the addition was completed the reaction mass was stirred for 60 minutes at 0°C after which 10 mL of water was added and the reaction mass was stirred an additional 20 minutes at 0°C. The aqueous layer was then separated and the organic layer was washed three times with 35 mL portions of aqueous 5% HCl solution and then twice with 75 mL portions of aqueous 5% NaHCO3 solution. The product solution was dried over 5% by weight of anhydrous MgSO4, and, after separation of the spent desiccant by filtration, the solvent was removed in vacuo leaving 3.9 g (91% of theory, uncorrected; theoretical yield = 4.3 g) of a colorless liquid. An IR spectrum of the product showed a slight OH band in the 3500 cm-1 region, a major peroxyoxalate carbonyl band was present at 17 97 cm-1, an oxalate carbonyl band was present at about 1750 cm-1 and a peroxide (-00-) band was present at about 845 cm-1. Impact shock testing showed that the<br>
-53-<br><br>
product was shock sensitive at 3 inches and not shock sensitive at one inch. The product was diluted with an equal weight of diglyme {to about 50% active) in order to suppress the product's impact shock sensitivity. The diglyme-diluted product had a shock sensitivity above 20 inches and a rapid heat test result of 45-48°C. The latter result confirmed that the product was an extremely low temperature peroxide.<br>

Annual Technical Conference - Reinforced Plastics/Composites Division, Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc., 1969). Using this procedure at 140°F (60°C), A-l, A-2, A-3 and 1-1 were comparatively evaluated. The level of I-1 was 1.0 g per 100 g of resin on a pure basis and the levels of A-l, A-2 and A-3 (per 100 g of resin) were equivalent in active oxygen content to a 1.0 g level of I-1 (pure basis). The results of this investigation are given in Example 16 Table and show that I-1 gelled and cured the resin much more rapidly than A-l, A-2 and A-3, hence, I-1, a novel monoperoxyoxalate composition of the instant invention, was much more active in curing the unsaturated polyester resin than were three of the lowest temperature, commercial peroxide catalysts.<br>
