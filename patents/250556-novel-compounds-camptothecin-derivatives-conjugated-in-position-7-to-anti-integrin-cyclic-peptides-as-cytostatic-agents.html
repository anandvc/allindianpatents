Camptothecins conjugated in position 7 with integrin antagonists Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds with cytotoxic activity-consisting of cyclopeptides containing the RGD sequence and derivatives of camptothecin, methods for the preparation thereof, their use as medicaments and compositions containing them.<br>
In particular, the compounds described in the present invention are endowed both with high affinity for integrins avb8 and avb5 and selective cytotoxic activity on human cell lines at micromolar concentrations.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Chemotherapeutic anticancer agents are the drugs with the most restrictive therapeutic window. In fact, since their cytotoxic activity is non-selective they may indiscriminately damage all the cells of the body with which they come into contact.<br>
There currently exists the problem of directing the cytotoxic agent selectively against the tumour cells, allowing the agent to exert its activity without damaging the cells of the healthy surrounding tissues, or at least limiting the damage as much as possible.<br>
It has been reported in the literature that blocking the integrins avb3 and avb5 by means of the use of selective cyclopeptides, the reference compound for which is regarded as cyclopentapeptide c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val) (JACS 1997, 119, 1328-35; international patent application WO 97/06791), or by means of the use of monoclonal antibodies (Cell, 1994, 79, 1157-64) leads to the arrest of angiogenesis and to a reduction of tumour growth. In addition, antimetastatic effects have also been observed (J. Clin. Invest, 1995, 96, 1815). Brooks et al. (Science, 1994, 264, 569-71) reported that the endothelial cells of the tumour<br><br>
2<br>
vasculature and the tumour cells themselves preferentially express in-tegrin avb3 compared to the quiescent cells of normal tissue. Among the compounds at an advanced stage of clinical development, we may mention c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-MeVal), or EMD121974 or cilengitide.<br>
Ruoslati and co-workers (Current Opinion in Oncology, 1998, 10, 560-5) showed that RGD analogues that bind to the tumour endothelium, once conjugated to the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin, form compounds that are more efficient and less toxic than doxorubicin alone. These authors also demonstrated, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the effect is attributable to the conjugation to RGD, inasmuch as the binding is antagonised by the free pep tide itself (Arap, Pasqualini and Ruoslati, Science, 1998, 279, 377-380).. Later, the same authors carried out other experiments consisting in chemically binding a pro-apoptotic peptide sequence to an RGD analogue, demonstrating that the new compounds were selectively toxic for angiogenic endothelial cells and had antican-cer activity in mice (Ruoslati,\Nature Medicine, 1999, 5, 1032-8).<br>
Marcus et al., in international patent application WO 01/17563, describe specific anticancer actiyity for cytotoxic agents, such as campto-thecin, conjugated by means of a spacer, consisting of one or more amino acids, to a non-peptidic inhibitor antagonist of integrins avb3 and avb5.<br>
Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy, 2001, 8, 783-787 describe the specific anticancer activity of a histidylated oligolysine conjugated to an RGD sequence, revealing a homing effect for tumours in mice.<br>
The concept of binding at the cell surface mediated by integrins has been proposed for gene transport (Hart, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 12468-12474).<br>
It has now been found that the 7-iminomethyl or 7-oxymethyl campto-thecin derivatives conjugated, possibly by means of suitable spacers, to cyclopeptide derivatives containing the RGD sequence are endowed<br><br>
with high, selective anticancer activity and can be advantageously-used for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of tumours.<br>
By virtue of their selective cytotoxic activity on tumour cells, the compounds according to the present invention yield medicaments with fewer and less severe side effects.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention are camptothecin derivatives conjugated to cyclopeptide derivatives containing the RGD sequence. The resulting molecules conserve unaltered both the cytotoxic properties of the original camptothecins and integrin binding properties with affinity comparable to that observed with the non-conjugated cyclopeptides. The result of this combination is to favour the concentration of the cytotoxic agent in those cells th'at most express integrins of the avb3 and avb5 type {homing). The cytotoxic agent exerts its intracellular activity in the conjugated and/or free form through enzymatic or hydrolytic action.<br>

The present invention also provides methods for the preparation of the above-mentioned compounds of Formula (I).<br>
The present invention comprises the use of compounds with the above-mentioned general formula (I) as active ingredients for medicaments, and particularly for medicaments useful as topoisomerase I inhibitors. Among the therapeutic applications deriving from topoisomerase I inhibition, we mention tumours and parasitic or viral infections.<br>
Given their particular pharmacological characteristics, the formula (I) compounds are also useful for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of tumours and the metastatic forms thereof.<br><br>
6<br>
The present invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of Formula (I) as active ingredients, in mixtures with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and/or excipient.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are the result of the condensation of a camptothecin molecule, functionalised in position 7, with a cyclopeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. This structural combination has the advantage of favouring the concentration of the cytotoxic agent (camptothecin) in the cells that most express in-tegrins of the avb3 and avb5 type. The cytotoxic agent exerts its activity in the conjugated and/or free form through enzymatic or hydrolytic action.<br>
The definitions of the various functional groups and residues, as well as the definitions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts that figure in the above-mentioned formula (I), are common knowledge to any expert chemist and no particular definitions are necessary. However, reference to such groups can be found in the technical and patent literature, e.g. in international patent applications WO 00/53607 (camptothecin derivatives having antitumor activity), WO 03/101995 (camptothecin with a modified lactone ring; i=l) and WO 03/101996 (ester in position 20 of camptothecin), filed in the name of the present applicant.<br>
One initial group of preferred compounds consists of compounds of Formula (I) where m = 1.<br>
In this first group, R2 is preferably alkylene, and more preferably me-thylene or ethylene, X is absent.<br>
Another group of preferred compounds consists of compounds of Formula (I) in which X = R4CH2(OCH2CH2)n3OCH2R4].<br>
The most preferred compounds according to the present invention are the following:<br><br>
7<br><br>
hereinafter referred to as ST2686;<br><br>
hereinafter referred to as ST2724<br><br>
8<br><br>
hereinafter referred to as ST2742<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared with the process described here below and exemplified for the preferred compounds according to the invention. This process, constitutes a further object of the invention.<br>
Fundamentally, the compounds of Formula (I) which are the object of<br>
the present invention are prepared by means of the condensation of<br>
i<br>
camptothecin, the pentacyclic structure of which is indicated briefly here by the abbreviation CP, suitably functionalised in position 7, with a cyclopeptide derivative Y1.<br>
The condensation reaction can be schematically represented as follows:<br>
7-CP-CH=N-(O)m-R2-Z1-X1 + Y1<br>
where 7-CP represents the polycyclic structure of a 7-substituted camptothecin and Z1, X1 and Y1represent respectively the groups Z, X and Y as defined in Formula I, eventually appropriately functionalised and/or protected so that the conjugated compounds of Formula I are obtained.<br><br>
9<br>
The 7-CP derivatives have been obtained using known approaches, such as those described in EP1044977, or in J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 3264-3274, S.Dallavalle et al., while the condensation reaction can be conducted using conventional methods, such as, for instance, Journal of Controlled Release 2003, 91, 61-73; S.S. Dharap et at; Journal of Medicinal Chem. 2003, 46, 190-3, R.Bhatt;<br>
The cyclopeptide Y1 can be prepared according to conventional peptide synthesis techniques, as described in examples 1 to 6.<br>
Once the desired cyclopeptide has been obtained, it will be used in the condensation reaction in its protected form, and the protective groups will be removed only after obtaining the final compound. The deprotec-tion is carried out using known methods, e.g. acid conditions by means of the use of pure trifluoroacetic acid or in the presence of chlorinated organic solvents.<br>
The camptothecin derivative 7-CP-CH=N-(O)m-R2-Z1-X1 is obtained using methods which are common knowledge to experts in the sector.<br>
The key intermediate consists in amino(alkoxy)-iminomethyl-camptothecin, the preparation of which is described in WO 03/101995 and WO 03/101996, starting from 7-formylcamptothecin by means of a reaction analogous to that described in the above-mentioned patent EP 1 044 977.<br>
7-Formylcamptothecin is a known compound, the preparation of which is described in patent application WO 00/53607 and in the references cited therein, where, amongst other things, the preparation of the N1-oxides is also described.<br>

The Y(-COOH) compounds are new and constitute a further object of the present invention, particularly as intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of Formula (I).<br>
The compounds described in the present invention are topoisomerase I inhibitors and are therefore useful as medicaments, particularly for the treatment of diseases that benefit from the inhibition of said topoisomerase. In particular, the compounds according to the present invention exhibit antiproliferative activity, and therefore are used for their therapeutic properties, and possess physicochemical properties which make them suitable for formulation in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions contain at least one compound of Formula (I) as active ingredient, in an amount such as to produce a significant therapeutic effect. The compositions covered by the present invention are entirely conventional and are obtained using methods that are common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the administration route opted for, the compositions will be in solid or liquid form and suitable for oral, parenteral or intravenous administration. The compositions according to the present invention contain, along with the active ingredient, at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. Formulation adjuvants, such as, for example, solubilising agents, dispersing agents, suspension agents or emulsifying agents may be particularly useful.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) can also be used in combination with other active ingredients, such as, for example, anticancer agents or other drugs with antiparasitic or antiviral activity, both in separate forms and in a single dosage form.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are useful as medicaments with anticancer activity, e.g. in non-microcytoma and small-cell lung cancer, or in colorectal or prostate cancer, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal carci-<br><br>
11<br>
noma, carcinoma of the liver, Kaposi's sarcoma, renal carcinoma, sarcoma and osteosarcoma, testicular carcinoma, carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the pancreas, melanoma, carcinoma of the urinary bladder and of the head and neck. One of the advantages afforded by the compounds according to the present invention is the combination of antitopoisomerase activity, proper to the camptothecin portion of the molecule, and the integrin inhibiting activity, provided by the cy-clopeptide portion of the molecule. The result is the possible combined action of the compounds according to the present invention which will be favourably received in the oncological sector by the experts operating in that sector. In fact, the cyclopeptide portion, containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, not only directs the molecule against tumours expressing integrins, but, once the target has been reached, is capable of exerting multiple functions, ranging from the internalisation of the cy-totoxic portion of the molecule to integrin inhibiting activity, with the resulting advantages, particularly in terms of the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis. The cyclopeptide portion, once separated from the camptothecin portion, is also capable of exerting its action at a distance from the site of the tumour, and therefore the compounds according to the present invention also prove useful in the prevention or treatment of metastatic forms.<br>
The medicaments which are the object of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of parasite diseases.<br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of c(Arg(Pmc)-Gly-Asp(OtBu)-D-Phe-Amp') (protected ST2581)<br>
1.587 mmol of Fmoc-Gly-Res (Res = Sasrin Resin®, Bachena) were suspended under stirring in 75 ml of DMF for 30 minutes, after which 18 ml of piperidine were added, continuing the stirring for a further 30 minutes. The resin, filtered and washed with DMF, was suspended in 50 ml of NMP (N-metbyl-pyrrolidone) for 15 minutes, after which Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, HOBT, TBTU and DIEA were added (3.174 mmol of each); after 2 hours of stirring, the suspension was filtered and washed with DMF. After deprotection with piperidine, the coupling was repeated with the other amino acids in succession, operating each time as described above, namely: Fmoc-Amp(Cbz)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe-OH, and Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH. After the last deprotection of the Fmoc-N-terminal, the linear pentapeptide was released from the resin with 45 ml of 1% TFA in DCM. This was dissolved in approximately 1 1 of CH3CN, and 4.761 mmol of HOBT and TBTU and 10 ml of DIEA were added; the solution was kept under stirring for 30 minutes, the solvent was evaporated to a small volume and the precipitation of the product was completed with water. The filtered crude product was dissolved in 27 ml of a mixture of MeOH and DMF 1:1; 5 mmol of ammonium for-<br><br>

miate and 0,55 g of 10% Pd/C were added and left under stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The suspension was filtered on ce-lite and brought to dryness1. The residue was purified by preparatory RP-HPLC (column: Alltima® C-18, Alltech; mobile phase 50% CH3CN<br>
in water + 0.1% TFA; retention time (Rt) = 9.13 minutes). 483 mg of a<br>

Example 3<br>
Synthesis of c(Arg(Pmc)Gly-Asp(OtBu)-D-Phe-N-Me-Amp) (protected ST2700)<br>
To a suspension of Fmoc-Phe(4-Pht-N-CH2)-COOH in anhydrous toluene brought to reflux 2 eq of CSA and 20 eq of paraformaldehyde were added, divided into 4 portions at intervals of 15 minutes. The mixture was left to cool, diluted with 120 ml of toluene and washed with 5% NaHCO3 and water. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 15 ml of CHCl3 + 15 ml of TFA + 700 µl of Et3SiH; the mixture was left in the dark to stir for 42 hours. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was purified by filtration on silica gel. Overall yield: 90%.<br>
The linear peptide was synthesized in solid phase as described in example 1, inserting Fmoc-N-Me-Phe-(4-Pht-N-CH2)-COOH as the third amino acid, prepared as described above. In this case the deprotections of N-Fmoc-terminal on resin were carried out with 30% diisopro-pylamine (300 eq) in solution in DMF (owing to the presence of phthalimide). After cyclisation, 500 mg of the peptide were dissolved hot in 10 ml of absolute EtOH, to which 0.9 ml of a solution of NH2-NH2H2O 1 M in ethanol was added.

Evaluation of IC50 parameters<br>
The affinity of the products for vitronectin receptors was expressed as IC50 value ± SD, i.e. as the concentration capable of inhibiting 50% of the specific radioligand-receptor binding. The IC50 parameter was elaborated using "ALLFIT" software.<br>
Results<br>
The conjugate ST2686 showed the most interesting affinity for integrin receptors compared with ST2724 and ST2742, given that the binding calculated as the IC50 value was low (see Table 1). The ability of ST2686 to compete with the radioligand for the integrin avb3 receptors was greater than shown by the free RGD peptide ST2650 and comparable to that of ST2650 for the avb3 receptors (Table 2). Also ST2724 revealed a major affinity to integrin receptors compared with the free peptide ST2649 (Table 2), whereas ST2742 showed a minor affinity compared with the RGD free peptide ST2661, although it was a potent affinity for both integrin receptors.<br>
Also the other RGD peptides (ST2581, ST2700, ST2701) demonstrated a potent interaction to integrin receptors (Table 2).<br><br>

Cvtotoxicity of the conjugates on different tumor cell lines<br>
To evaluate the effect of the compound on cell survival, the sulphoro-damine B test was used. PC3 human prostate carcinoma, A498 human renal carcinoma, A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were used. A2780 and PC3 tumor cells were grown RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), whereas A498 tumor cells were grown in EMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). Tumor cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at approximately 10% of confluence and were allowed to attach and recover for at least 24 h. The effect of eight concentrations of the tested<br><br>
27<br>
drugs were analyzed to calculate their IC5O value (the concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival). The plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. At the end of the treatment, the plates were washed by remotion of the surnatant and addition of PBS 3 times. 200 µl PBS and 50 µl of cold 80%TCA were added. The plates were incubated on ice for at least 1 h. TCA was removed, the plates were washed 3 times for immersion in distilled-water and dried on paper and at 40°C for 5 min. Then 200 µl of 0.4% sulphorodamine B in 1% acetic acid were added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for other 30 min. Sulphorodamine B was removed, the plates were washed for immersion in 1% acetic acid for 3 times, then they were dried on paper and at 40 °C for 5 min. Then 200 µl Tris 10 mM were added, the plates were kept under stirring for 20 min. The survival cell was determined as optical density by a Multiskan spectrofluorimeter at 540 nm. The amount of cells killed was calculated as the percentage decrease in sulphorodamine B binding compared with control cultures. The IC50 values were calculated with the "ALLFIT" program.<br>
i<br>
As reported the conjugates showed the most potent cytotoxic activity on A2780 ovarian tumor cells with IC50 values between 0.16 and 0.4 µM. On A498 tumor cells, ST2742 was more active with an IC50 value of 0.74 µM followed by ST2686 and ST2724 (IC5o=3.2 and 4.3 µM, respectively) (Table 3).<br>
