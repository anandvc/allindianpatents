				<td>TITLE: USB POWER AMPLIFICATION SPEAKER ADAPTER UNIT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a USB power amplification speaker adapter unit, and more particularly to one that has provided both of a digital conversion chip and a power amplification chip on an adapter of the same USB port to become an integrated unit; the circuits for the power amplification chip and the digital conversion chip are not installed inside the speaker to reduce the size of the speaker for easy portability, upgraded power amplification and better sound effects with the omission of sound blast card, AC power cable, transformer and USB cable by modifying the USB cable into a general speaker cable; and allows multiple adaptation options for connecting the USB slot from a PC to directly produce the sound effects thanks to the absence of sophisticate installation.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Usually the speakers requires the connection of AC power line, transformer and USB cable with the circuits installed inside the speaker, resulting in larger speaker cabinet that prevents easy portability.    Complicate installation of those cables and circuits prevents upgraded power, sound quality, and cost reduction that discourage the popular use of speakers.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a USB power amplification speaker adapter that is more practical and easier in use by allowing multiple options of adaptation.   To achieve the purpose, the USB is used as the interface to permit fast and easy application.   Both of the digital conversion chip and the power amplification chip are provided o the adapter of the same USB port to become an integrated unit.   Circuits of the digital conversion chip and the power amplification chip are not provided in the speaker cabinet so to reduce its size for easy portability, upgrading power amplification and achieving better sound effects.   Sound blast card, AC power cable, transformer and USB cable are omitted by modifying the USB cable into that of the general speaker to avoid complicate installation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following descriptions are of exemplary embodiments only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way.   Rather, the following description provides a convenient illustration for implementing exemplary embodiments of the invention. Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a USB power amplification speaker adapter unit A of the present invention is comprised of an upper lid B, a lower lid C, a circuit board D and a pair of speakers E.   Wherein, a chip G (a digital conversion chip and a power amplification chip in one) is provided on the circuit board D and integrated with a USB port F.   Both of the upper lid B and the lower lid C are incorporated to each other as illustrated in FIG. 2 and FIG. 8.   The present invention A is adapted to a USB slot of a PC by the USB port F.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the adapter unit A is respectively connected to an earphone unit K and the pair of speakers E through an output jack I; or alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 5, the output jack I is connected to a optical fiber terminal L output.   The output jack I may be converted into a dual-purpose connector to receive the insertion of an optical fiber terminal L<br>
and an earphone audio terminal J.   Whereas the output jack I can be connected to the output of the pair of speakers E, the earphones unit K, or an optical fiber cable M, a device of output may be selected according to the needs of the user to expand the comprehensive application of the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 6 for a schematic view of an output assembly showing the diversity and all-purpose of the present invention.   Disregarding the type of the output device, the present invention may be connected to a PC through the USB port F to be converted by the chip G into signals to be outputted to any type as illustrated in the block chart of FIG. 7 showing the functions of the chip G.   Wherein, all the flow processes of functions are integrated into the chip G while complying with its USB transmission protocol to execute transmission and operation.   The USB protocol for being related to an open protocol of the prior art will not be elaborated herein.<br>
Now referring to FIGS. 8 and 9 for two preferred embodiments of the adapter unit A, wherein, a USB slot is provided to a PC H or a notebook computer N and the USB slot is connected to the adapter unit A for use.   As illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11, an output device is connected to the chip G to provide multiple applications.   The chip G is also used to process the sound for increasing the folds of power amplification and achieving better sound effects.<br>
An extension cable Q of the USB is used to connect the adapter unit A to a PC in the way as illustrated in FIG. 13.<br>
Furthermore, a connection cable P is used to separate the USB port F from the circuit board D for the main portion of the circuit board O (comprised of the circuit board D and the upper and the lower lids B and C) to become a stand-alone unit as illustrated in FIG. 12.   The output jack I is connected to the pair of speakers by a 3-way cable R as illustrated in FIG. 14.   An output cable S connected to the main portion of the circuit board O (comprised of the circuit board D and the upper and the lower lids B and C) to function as the output as illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
