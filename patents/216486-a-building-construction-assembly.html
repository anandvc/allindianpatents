				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a building construction assembly composed of plastic structural modules which are inlercomnectable to create the shell of a residential or other edifice, and in particular to an assembly of this type in which the modules are interconnected by snap-in joiners to create the walls of the shell.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The need for low cost housing that is available on short notice becomes most pressing when there is an influx of people into a community who are in search of such housing but cannot afford the cost of standard housing, nor can they wait out the prolonged period it normally takes to construct a standard house.<br>
Such a situation arose at the conclusion of World War II when thousands of veterans returned to their towns and villages to rejoin or acquire wives and to find a suitable residence for their families. U.S. Pat. No. ],958,124 is addressed lo this situation, for it discloses a building construction assembly composed of factory-manufactures block-like hollow steel modules which when interconnected at a building site creates the basic shell of a livable residence.<br>
But the commercial acceptance of a construction assembly of steel modules was no! widespread, for it was discouraged by the need lo weld together a multitude of such modules. This requirement added substantially lo the cost of erecting the steel shell of the edifice and the time it took to do so.<br><br>
Of greater prior art interest is the 1999 U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,944 to Dc Zen which deals with an assembly of interconnect able thermoplastic structural components, adapted to create the shell of an edifice, as does a construction assembly in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The structural components disclosed in the De Zen patent are each provided along its length with grooves adapted to mate with interlocking flanges of a box connector serving to interconnect adjacent components. A serious drawback of the De Zen arrangement is that it is necessary to slide the elongated structural components into the box connectors and it is difficult to do so at a building site, Also of prior art interest is De Zen U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,706,620 and 5,974,751 which show construction assemblies similar to those in the De Zen "944 Patent.<br>
There are known also building structures disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,247,773. In this patent are described modular structural components extruded from plastic. The structures are used for building a wall, ceiling, roof etc. The structures can be connected by virtue of male and female means provided on the middle of short, transversal walls of the modules. For this purpose the male component of one module has resilient flanges that can be forced into a corresponding female slot of the adjacent module. Relevant to the present invention is the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, 10 depicting a dedicated joiner consisting of two male locking protrusions facing in opposite directions and adapted for insertion into corresponding female depressions made in the modules. The disadvantage of this solution lies in the fact that relatively high forces should be applied to join the modules, since the force is to be applied perpendicularly to the transversal wall of the module and it should be sufficient to deflect both resilient flanges of the male component, the outcome of which is that assembly becomes complicated and inconvenient. This renders the assembling complicate and inconvenient. Furthermore, the disposition of the female depressions on the middle of the transverse wall allows to join the modules merely in sidc-by-side relationship and not in a cross relationship.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a building construction assembly of the above type in<br>
whose a group of modules (11), which are intcrconnectable to create a shell of an edifice<br>
(10), each module (11) in the group is defined by a pair of parallel panels (20, 21) having<br>
opposite ends, wherein said lateral panels are bridged by at least one transversal web (22)<br>
extending between the panels,<br>
a joiner (J, SJ) for interconnecting modules in the group said joiner having at least two<br>
faces (Fl, F2) detachably connectable to the opposite ends of the module characterize<br>
in that each lateral panel (20,21) terminates at either of the opposite ends thereof with a<br>
flexible catch region (CI, C2) which run the full length of module and are provided with<br>
bent-in catches and,<br>
either face (J, SJ) of the joiner is provided why a pair of leech (TA, TB, TX, T Y) adapted<br>
and<br>
a joiner (J,SJ) adapted to interconnect at least two modules (II), each of them having a<br>
pair of parallel lateral panels (21) bridged by at least one transversal web (22), wherein<br>
either of said lateral panels terminates by a flexible catch region (C1,C2) which run the<br>
full length of module and are provided with bent-in catches,   characterized in that said<br>
joiner (J,SJ) has at least two faces (F],F2,23,24,25,26), each of the faces being provided<br>
with a pair of teeth (TA,TB,TX,TY), which are engageabic by either of the catch regions<br>
(C],C2).<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, the invention is to provide a building construction assembly composed of factory-manufactured thermoplastic modules capable of being interconnected quickly and without difficulty at a building site to erect the permanent shell or framework of a residential structure or other edifice.<br>
The invention is to provide a building construction assembly of the above type in whose modules are interconnected by snap-in double-faced and quad-faced joiners, the modules being joined together simply by a snap-in action.<br>
Among the significant advantages of this invention are the following;<br>
1st,      The snap-in joiners obviate the difficulties encountered in prior art assemblies in which it is necessary to slide the modules with respect to their joiners in order to interconnect them, whereby assembly and erecting of a structure substantially does not require applying force or using tools;<br>
2nd. The snap-in joiners interconnect the modules so that no free spaces exist therebetween in walls constructed of these modules, and further, the joiners are concealed between adjoining modules;<br>
3rd. The snap-in joiners facilitate the erection of the complete edifice shell at a building site, even a complex edifice, in a matter of hours, rather than days or weeks;<br>
4th. The cost of erecting an edilice shell by interconnecting modules by means of snap-in joiners is relatively low, yet the interconnections are strong and durable;<br><br>
5th. A shell created by interconnected modules in accordance with the invention can readily be anchored on a ground pad at a building site, making it possible thereafter to quickly complete the internal structure of the edifice.<br>
Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a building constriction assembly composed of factory-manufactured thermoplastic structural modules which when interconnected at a building site then create the entire shell of an edifice having side walls and a roof. Each module is formed by a pair of parallel panels bridged by transverse webs and provided on either side along its length with a pair of flexible catch flanges projecting from the panels.<br>
When assembling these modules to create the shell of the edifice, adjacent modules are interconnected in coplanar relation by a double-faced joiner; on each face of which is a pair of teeth. When one face of the joiner is pressed against the side of a module, its catch flanges then flex to snap into and behind the teeth to connect the joiner to this module. The other face of the joiner is similarly connected to the side of an adjacent module whereby the modules are then interconnected in coplanar relation.<br>
When it becomes necessary to interconnect four modules in a cross formation, use is then made of a square quad-faced joiner on each face of which is a pair of teeth lo engage the catch flanges of the module joined lo this face.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings, shown therein is a one-story house 10 suitable as a family residence, the shell of which destines the walls and roof of the house. The shell is erected at a building site by interconnecting an assembly of structural modules 1 i in accordance with the invention.<br>
These modules arc factory-manufactured on a mass production basis to produce an assembly of modules appropriate to ihc architecture of the edifice. The assembly is then shipped to the building site at which it is only necessary to interconnect the modules 11 to erect the side walls 12 and 13 of the house and its gabled roof 14. Ihe modules forming the walls are structured to provide rectangular openings to accommodate a door 15 and windows 16 and 17.<br><br>
The gabled roof 14 is formed by interconnected modules 11 forming angled sides at whose peak is a keel 18. Overlying keel 18 and covering its junctions with the angled sides of the roof is a Hashing 19 which serves to waterproof the roof<br>
The shell of house 10 is anchored by anchor rods or other means to a rectangular concrete ground pad P. The architecture of house 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 are by way of example only. In practice, the assembly of modules may be tailored to create an edifice of any design having side walls which arc vertical, horizontal or angled. When a colony of prefabricated houses is planned, each erected by an assembly of modules in accordance with the invention, it is then desirable that the houses in the colony have different design to avoid regimentation and to provide a more natural community.<br>
Each module 11, as shown in FIG. 3 is extruded of high-strength thennoplastic material! such as PVC, polyethylene or polycarbonate in the manner disclosed in the above-identified De Zen patents. In practice, the plastic material may be ftber-rcinforced by glass, carbon or other fibers which act to strengthen the module.<br>
Module 11 consists of parallel panels 20 and 21 bridged by a row of cquispaced transverse webs 22 integral with the panels to form a light-weight structure highly resistant to compressive and bending forces. Because the modules are not heavy, they are easy to handle at the construction site. The space between transverse webs 22 may be filled with foamed thermal isolating material or may including wiring and other installations of the constructions.<br>
The air space between the panels when the modules are interconnected to form a wall may be used to accommodate electrical wiring or plumbing pipes. The entrapped a space imparts thermal insulation properties to the wall.<br>
Extending from the opposite ends of module panels 20 and 21 are flexible catch flanges CI and C2 which run the full length of the module and are provided with bent-in catches. Flanges CI and C2 project beyond the webs 22 at the opposite ends of the web row, and<br><br>
because the catch flanges arc flexible, they can be deflected in the manner to be later explained to catch onto the teeth of a module joiner.<br>
To join adjacent modules llA and 1 IB which are in line with each other so that they are in coplanar relation, there is provided, as shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, a double-faced joiner J having a pair of opposing rectangular faces Fl and F2. Projecting from face Fl is a pair of parallel teeth TA and TB having a trapezoidal cross section, only the outer side of the teeth being sloped to function as a ramp. Projecting from face F2 which is opposite face Fl is a like pair of teeth TA and TB.<br>
The dimensions of double-faced joiner J complement those of the modules 11A and 11B to be interconnected. Hence when face Fl of joiner J is pressed against the side of module 1 lA, its projecting teeth TA and TB engage catch flanges CI and C2 on the side of this module, causing the flanges to flex and snap into and behind the teeth and thereby connect joiner J to module 1 lA. And when face F2 of joiner J is pressed against the side of the adjacent module IIB lo connect the joiner thereto, modules llA and IIB are then interconnected in a side-by-side, coplanar relation as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
When the modules are interconnected by double-faced joiner J, the double-faced joiner J is then confined within the space between the end webs 22 of the adjacent modules as shown in FIG. 4. Hence there is no free space between the modules when they arc interconnected to form a planar wall of the edifice.<br>
When il is necessary to join a planar wall to another planar wall at right angles hereto, then as shown in FIGS. 4 and 8, one must use for this purpose a four-faced square joiner SJ each rounded corner of which is defined by a pair of teeth TX and TY at right angles to each other. Thus the opposing parallel faces 23 and 24 of the quad-faced square junction SJ are each provided with a pair of teeth TX, while the opposing parallel faces 25 and 26 which are at right angles to faces 23 and 24 and are each provided with a pair of teeth TY.<br><br>
Snapping into the pair of teeth in each face of square joiner SJ are the flexible catch flanges C1 and C2 extending from the side of a module. Thus FIG, 4 shows a third module 11C joined to a face of square junction SJ so that it is at right angles to the second module 1 IB. A fourth module (not shown) can be joined to the face 25 of the junction so that it too is at right angles to the third module, and a fifth module (not shown) can be joined to face 23 so that it is in line with the second module. Thus when modules are connected to all four faces of the square joiner SJ they are in symmetrical cross formation.<br>
"fhe double-faced and four-faced make it possible to create the shell of an edifice having planar walls at right angles to each other. If the geometry of the shell is such as to require a joiner for providing an acute angle between one wall and another, the four-faced joiner for this purpose then has an appropriate parallelogram shape.<br>
While there has been shown an assembly of interconnect able modules for erecting the shell of an edifice, it is to be understood that many changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Thus the modules, instead of being extruded of thermoplastic material may be formed of extruded aluminum.<br><br><br>
