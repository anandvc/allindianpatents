Title:<br>
FREQUENCY MULTIPLYING ARRANGEMENTS AND A METHOD FOR FREQUENCY 5  MULTIPLICATION.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  frequency  multiplying<br>
arrangement,  comprising  a transistor  arrangement,  a  current<br>
10 (voltage) source, first impedance means and output means for extracting an output signal comprising a multiplied frequency harmonic of an input signal. The invention also relates to a method for multiplying, e.g. doubling, the frequency of a signal input to an arrangement.<br>
15<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
Circuits for frequency generation are fundamental within communication systems, radio systems or radiometer systems. A frequency synthesizer is a circuit generating a very precise,<br>
20 temperature stable frequency according to an external reference frequency. Most of the time the frequency also must have a constant phase difference with respect to the reference signal. For example a multi-standard frequency synthesizer must be able to synthesize  different  bands  of  frequencies  for  for  example<br>
25 different wireless standards within telecommunications. A multiband frequency synthesizer often has to be able to synthesize a wide range of frequencies while still satisfying strict phase noise specifications. Single-band frequency synthesizers are commonly used to synthesize a narrow frequency band whereas<br>
30 multiband frequency synthesizers are needed to synthesize multiple frequency bands. Generally there can be said to be three different types of frequency synthesizers, namely the table look-up synthesizer, the direct synthesizer and the indirect or phase<br><br>
WO 2005/060088<br><br>
PCT/SE2003/002017<br><br>
3<br>
locked synthesizer. Today it is aimed at achieving low cost, fully integrated frequency synthesizers, which however is quite difficult. since the different components involved, such â€¢as low pass filters etc. normality have to be external due to noise                5 requirements etc. Most synthesizers used in mobile telecommunication systems are of the type Phase Locked Loop synthesizers, in the following denoted PLL synthesizers. The reference frequency, which generally is a low frequency, is multiplied by a variable integer (sometimes a fraction of a)<br>
10 number. This is achieved by dividing the output frequency for that number, and adjusting the output frequency such that the divided frequency will equal the reference frequency. Thus, often the frequency generated by the oscillator has to be multiplied by a number N in order to achieve the desired frequency.<br>
15<br>
It is known to perform both a frequency generation functionality by means of an oscillator and a frequency multiplication by means of one circuit, for example an oscillator at the same time used as a frequency multiplier. However, the conversion of the reference<br>
20 frequency to the multiplied frequency, e.g. the double frequency, is often inefficient and a lot of amplifying circuitry is generally needed and, as referred to above, it may be difficult to provide an integrated circuit.<br>
25 It is known to use two balanced transistors to obtain a doubled frequency when extracting an output signal over the emitter. At the emitter node the currents on the double frequency are in phase and can thus be extracted over an external load or impedance". However, generally the amplitude is low and it mostly needs to be<br>
30  amplified.<br>
US-ft-4 810 97 6 shows an oscillator which is balanced and in which a resonant impedance network is connected between the control<br><br>
WO 2005/060088<br><br>
PCT/SE2003/002017<br><br>
4<br>
ports of two matched transistors. A capacity is connected in parallel across the two inputs of the transistors. The inputs of the transistors are connected to a matched current source respectively. The signals at the transistor outputs are summed            5 together at a common node. The signals of resonant frequency in each arm of the oscillator are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase. This means that the signals cancel at the resonant frequency, whereas signals at the second harmonic frequency add constructively and thus are enhanced. The effect will be a net           10 frequency doubling. For high frequency operation bipolar transistors are utilized. However, also this arrangement suffers from the drawbacks referred to above.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a state of the art balanced amplifier used as a             15 frequency doubler. The two transistors operate in anti-phase and a load is taken out at the emitters of the transistors. The amplitude of the voltage extracted at the double frequency will be quite low for such a circuit due to the fact that the capacitor located after the emitters of the transistors will 20  short-circuit higher frequencies, which is disadvantageous.<br>
Fig. 2, which is a state of the art figure, shows a so called Colpitt oscillator illustrating two transistors operating in anti-phase. The load is taken out at either of the collectors of 25 the transistors. This will also result in a comparatively low amplitude for the extracted voltage at the double frequency due to the fact that the resonant circuit will short-circuit harmonic overtones.<br>
30  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore a frequency multiplying arrangement as initially referred to for the which the conversion of the reference frequency to a multiple frequency, or particularly to<br><br>

the double frequency, is efficient, particularly such that amplifying circuitry is avoided to an extent which is as high as possible, or even more particularly, completely. Furthermore an arrangement is needed which can be fabricated as a small sized         5 integrated circuit, particularly as a Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC).

Particularly, an amplifier is needed through which one or more of the above mentioned objects can be achieved.                       10 Still further an arrangement is needed through which different kinds of transistors can be used while still allowing fulfillment of providing the objects referred to above.<br>
A method for frequency multiplication is therefore also needed           15  through which one or more of the above mentioned objects can be achieved.<br>

20  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a known balanced amplifier, here used as a frequency doubler. The two transistors T0/ T0' operate in antiphase, i.e. signals applied to the bases of the transistors are maintained in antiphase. The output signal is taken out at<br>
25 the emitters. With this circuit the extracted output voltage gets a low amplitude at the doubled frequency (2xf0) among others due to the capacitor C0' after the emitters of the respective transistors acting as a short-circuit for higher frequencies, which is a clear disadvantage.<br><br>
30<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a known Colpitt oscillator. The two transistors (also here denoted T0, T0) in such an oscillator operate in antiphase.    The   output   signal   is   extracted   at   the   collector   of<br><br>
WO 2005/060088<br><br>
PCT/SE2003/002017<br><br>
10<br>
one of the transistors. The amplitude of the output (extracted) voltage will be relatively low at twice the input (reference) frequency (2xf0) ,  since the resonance circuit will act as a short-circuit for harmonics/overtones.<br>
 5<br>
Fig. 3 is a simplified circuit diagram illustrating one implementation of the inventive concept. The circuit of Fig. 3 shows an arrangement 10 comprising a first transistor Tl and a second transistor T2. An input voltage Vlin (0Â°) is provided to<br>
10 Tl and an input voltage V2in (180Â°) is provided to T2, wherein Vlin and V2in are similar but differ 180Â° in phase in relation to one another. Tl and T2 each comprises a base b, an emitter e and a collector c. It is here supposed that second impedance means are provided comprising two connected inductors LI 1, L2 2, here<br>
15 a transformer with a mid-extraction point P. The mid-extraction point P will here act as a short circuit for odd frequencies since there is an excitation of an odd mode between the collectors c (Tl) and c (T2), i.e. they are 180Â° out of phase. For even overtones even modes are obtained, i.e. the signals are<br>
20 in phase, and even overtones are added. The fundamental frequency component will be substantially cancelled. At the midpoint there will be currents at even frequencies, even harmonics are enhanced, as referred to above, which here are extracted as a voltage drop V0ut (nf) (wherein n e.g. = 2, i.e. at the doubled<br>
25 frequency) over first impedance means 3, here comprising an inductor Lc 3. The amplitude of the output voltage Vout is much higher than a voltage extracted across the emitter (as it is done in prior art).<br>
30 The current generator 4 is used to set the operation current of the transistors Tl, T2 and the capacitor C3 5 is used to ground the emitters  (for providing e.g. half cosine shaped pulses).<br><br>
WO 2005/060088<br><br>
PCT/SE2003/002017<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Since the currents are out of phase, there will be no current at the fundamental frequency.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another implementation of the inventive concept in              5   the form of an amplifying and multiplying arrangement 20. The circuit diagram is similar to that of Fig. 3, with the difference that a resistor Re 3i is used as first impedance means. In other aspects the functioning is similar, and similar reference numerals provided with an index 1 are used for corresponding components.                        10<br>
Fig, 5 shows still another embodiment of the present invention. It relates to an amplifying and multiplying arrangement 30 with two<br>
transistors TI2, T22 wherein Vin to Tl2 and T22 respectively is 180Â° out of phase. The difference is here that the collectors of Tl2                        15 and T22 respectively are connected directly to each other and there are no second impedance means, but the output voltage Vout is extracted at the junction where the two collectors are connected, over the first impedance means, here an inductor Lc 32.<br>
20 Components similar to those of Figs. 3,4 are given the same reference numerals with index 2.<br>
Fig. 6 shows somewhat more in detail an embodiment of an amplifier 40 substantially similar to that disclosed in Fig. 3. Similar<br>
25 components are given similar reference numerals with index 3. A voltage source is used to provide the input voltage Vin, and tone generators (0Â°, 180Â°) are used to provide input voltages differing 180Â° in phase to two transistors Tl3r T23. Resistors R1-R4 are used to bias the transistors Tl3, T23 in a conventional manner. A<br>
30 capacitor C3 53 is used to connect the emitters of the transistors to ground such that a half cosine pulse shaped waveform with a lot of  (enhanced)  harmonics,  particularly even harmonics can be<br><br>

provided). The first impedance means Lc1 33 comprises an inductor connected in series with second impedance means LI' 13, L2' 23 connected to the collectors of the respective transistors Tla, T23. The output signal Vout (e.g. V (2fref)) is extracted over                      5 the first impedance means Lo' 33, i.e. before the second impedance means LI1 13, L2' 23, e.g. at the junction node P between the first 33 and second 13, 23 impedance means. In other aspects the functioning is similar to that described above.<br>
10 Fig. 7 shows still another implementation of the present invention comprising an oscillator with a frequency multiplying functionality 50 two transistors Tl4, T24 operating in anti-phase. The oscillator comprises a so called Colpitt oscillator. Capacitors C31,  C31 are used to ground the emitters of the<br>
15 transistors Tl4, T24 whereas capacitors C4i, C4i are used to ground the bases of the transistors Tl4, T24. Capacitor Co, forms part of a resonant circuit comprising second impedance means L21 14, L31 24 such that the inductors 14, 24 and the capacitor C6i form a parallel resonant circuit for the oscillator. The output voltage<br>
20 Vout is extracted at the node between the first impedance means consisting of inductor Lc" 34 and the second impedance means comprising the resonant circuit. The resistors all denoted R function in a manner similar to that of prior art arrangements and will therefore not be further described herein. Capacitors C51, C51<br>
25  are feedback capacitors.<br>
like in the arrangements comprising amplifiers, the transistors operate in anti-phase. In an arrangement as discussed herein above, there will be a higher current through collector-emitter                30 and since the transistors operate in anti-phase, half-wave wave forms are provided and even harmonics are enhanced whereas the fundamental frequency is cancelled. Since Vout is extracted over the first impedance means 34, at the junction between the first<br><br>
WO 2005/060088<br><br>
PCT/SE2003/002017<br><br>
12<br>
and second impedance means, the voltage' that can be extracted will be very much higher than in known arrangements where the output voltage is extracted over the emitters.<br>
5 Fig. 8 is a somewhat more detailed illustration of an arrangement according to the invention which shows a frequency multiplying amplifier 60.<br>
An input voltage Vin (DC) of 2[V] is here used. Of course other<br>
10 voltages can be used. For exemplifying, by no means limiting, reasons, numerical values are given for the different components etc. As in the embodiments described in the foregoing, the arrangement 60 comprises a first and a second transistor Tl, T2 respectively. A DC supply voltage of 2 Volts is, as referred to<br>
15 above, used and V^ (2V, 0Â°) is supplied to Tl, whereas Vin (2V, 180Â°) is supplied to T2, i.e. the input supply voltages are 180Â° out of phase with respect to one another. Resistors R2i# R22r R23/ R24 are used for biasing the transistors Tl, T2. Also capacitors Cn, C21 are used for biasing the transistors. R22 may<br>
20 have a resistance of e.g. 5kQ, R23 of 5,2kQ, R2i of 5,2kQ and R24 of 5kQ, whereas Cn, C22 each may have a capacitance of 1,0(LIF. C33 may have a capacitance of 2pF and it is used to ground the emitters of Tl and T2 such that the waveform will be half-wave shaped, e.g. comprise a half cosine pulse. As referred to earlier<br>
25 in the application, the output signal will have much overtones (the fundamental component being suppressed) , particularly even harmonics, which are added, which is exceedingly advantageous. IDC may comprise 8 [mA].<br>

Figs. 9A-9D, 10A-10C below illustrate the waveforms of the signals in an arrangement similar to that described above with reference to Fig. 8. Particularly Fig. 10C illustrates Vout/ i.e.                                    5  the extracted output voltage (at, here, doubled frequency).<br>
l2i indicates (Fig. 8) the second impedance means, here comprising a transformer connected to the collectors of Tl and T2. In series with said transformer I21 first impedance means inductor Lcl0 are                     10 connected over which Vout is extracted (cf. also Fig. 10C) . LCio here e.g. has an inductance of 20 nH.<br>
In Figs.  9A-9D,  10A-10C signal waveforms are illustrated in diagrams for an embodiment in which Vin = 200 mV, Ie = 4 mA, Ce =             15  2 pF and the transformer inductance L = 2 nH.<br>
Figs. 9A, 9B show the waveforms for the collector voltages VCi, Vc2 for Tl and T2 respectively in [V] as a function of time {in ps) .<br>
20<br>
Figs. 9C, 9D illustrate the collector currents ICi, Ic2 in [mA] as a function of time (in [ps]) for Tl and T2 respectively. As can be seen the signals, comprise half cosine pulses; half of the cycle is zero and therebetween (or the remainder of the' signals) is<br>
25  sine/cosine shaped. Thus, there are a lot of overtones (even), which are added, and these currents are attractive for extraction.<br>
Fig. 10A shows the variation in emitter voltage in [mV] as a function of time (in ps) . As can be seen from the figure, the            30  emitter peak-to-peak voltage is 80 mV.<br><br>

Fig. 10B shows the transistor base voltage [V] as a function of time in [ps]. Finally Fig. 10C shows the extracted output voltage V0ut in [V] as a function of time in [ps], i.e. the voltage of the multiplied (here doubled) frequency signal. As referred to earlier                       5 in the application it is particularly the output voltage (Vout) in the node junction between the first and the second impedance means. The amplitude of the signal Vp-P (V peak-to-peak) = 1,9 [V] as can be seen from Fig. IOC. The conversion gain Gc will then be 1,9 [V] / 0,4 [V] Â« 5; 0,4 being 2 x 0,2,  wherein 0,2 is the<br>
10 amplitude of the input signal, i.e. the sum of the amplitudes of the two input signals will be 0,4. For a corresponding, conventional arrangement the conversion gain would be approximately 0,15 / 0,4 Â« 0,4 i.e. Vout = 0,15 [V], and Gc of an arrangement according to the present invention would (in this<br>
15 particular embodiment) thus be more than 10 times the conversion gain Gc of an arrangement in which the output voltage is extracted over the emitter.<br>
Although it is mainly referred to a frequency doubled signal, it           20  should be clear that also other (even) overtones (harmonics) are provided,  and  summed,  whereas the  fundamental  component  is cancelled, as well as odd overtones.<br>
Particularly  the  arrangement is implemented as  a Monolithic 25  Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) .<br>
Different kinds of transistors can be used, e.g. bipolar transistor, FETs etc. According to the invention a signal of 2 x the reference frequency (or an even factor x the reference         30 frequency) can be extracted at virtual ground of the resonant circuit in the case of an oscillator (or an amplifier).<br><br>

It should be clear that the invention of course not is limited to the explicitly illustrated embodiments, but that it can be varied in a number of ways within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
