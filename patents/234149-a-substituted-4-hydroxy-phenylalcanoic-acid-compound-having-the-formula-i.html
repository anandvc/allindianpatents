				<td>The present invention relates to certain novel compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine. More particularly, it relates to compounds which exhibit activation, including agonist activity, to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) thereby enabling them to modulate the blood glucose levels in mammals.<br>
The treatment of Type II or Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) remains unsatisfactory despite the widespread use of insulin, sulfonylureas (e.g. chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, tolazamide), and biguanides (e.g, phenformin, metformin) as oral hypoglycaemic agents. Treatment of NIDDM usually begins with a combination of diet and exercise, with progression to oral hypoglycaemics (e.g. sulfonylureas) and in more severe cases, insulin. Unfortunately the available hypoglycaemics suffer from a wide range of undesirable toxic effects which limits their usefulness in treatment of NIDDM. There is thus a clear need for the development of novel hypoglycaemic agents which may be less toxic or which suceed where others are ineffective.<br>
In the last decade a class of compounds known as thiazolidinediones (e.g. U.S. Pat Nos. 5,089,514, 4,342,771, 4,367,234, 4,340,605, 5,306,726) have emerged as effective antidiabetic agents that enhance the insulin sensitivity of target tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, adipose) in animal models of NIDDM and also reduce lipid and insulin levels in these animal models. Recently, the thiazolidinedione troglitazone was shown to have these same beneficial effects in human patients suffering from impaired glucose tolerance, a metabolic condition that precedes the development of NIDDM, as in patients suffering from NIDDM (J. J. Nolan et. al., N. Eng. J. Med. 1188-1193, 331 (1994)). While the mechanism of action is unclear, thiazolidinediones do not cause increases in insulin secretion or in the number or affinity of insulin receptor binding sites, suggesting that thiazolidinediones amplify post-receptor events in the insulin signaling cascade (J. R. Colca and D. R. Morton, "Antihyperglycemic thiazolidinediones: ciglitazone and its analogs," in New Antidiabetic Drugs, C. J. Bailey and P. R. Flatt, eds., Smith-Gordon, New York, 255-261 (1990)).<br><br>
Thiazolidinediones also induce the in vitro adipocyte differentiation of preadipocyte cell lines (A. Hiragun, et. al. J. Cell. Physiol. 124-130, 134 (1988); R. F. Kleitzen, et. al., Mo/. Pharmacol. 393-398, 41 (1992)). Treatment of pre-adipocyte cell lines with the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone results in increased expression of the adipocyte-specific genes aP2 and adipsin as well as the glucose transporter proteins GLUT-1 and GLUT-4, which suggests that the hypoglycaemic effects of thiazolidinediones seen in vivo may be mediated through adipose tissue.<br>
Recently, an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors termed Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) has been discovered. PPAR-gamma is one of a subfamily of closely related PPARs encoded by independent genes (C. Dreyer, et. al., Cell 879-887, 68 (1992); A. Schmidt, et. al., Mol. Endocrine/. 1634-1641, 6, (1992); Y. Zhu, et. al., J. Biol. Chem. 26817-26820, 268 (1993); S. A. Kliewer et. al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 7355-7359, 91, (1994)). Three mammalian PPARs have been isolated and termed PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, and NUC-1. These PPARs regulate expression of target genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements (PPRE). To date, PPRE's have been identified in the enhancers of a number of genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs play a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H. Keller and W. Wahli, Trends Endocrin. Met. 291-296, 4 (1993)). It has now been reported that thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of PPAR-gamma and bind directly to the PPAR-gamma receptor (J. M. Lehmann et. al., J. Blol. Chem. 12953-12956, 270 (1995)), providing evidence that PPAR-gamma is a possible target for the therapeutic actions of the thiazolidinediones.<br>
We have now discovered a novel group of compounds which bind to and activate the PPAR-gamma receptor. These compounds also show good blood-glucose lowering activity and are therefore of use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, and are of particular use in the treatment of Type II<br>
*<br>
diabetes.<br><br>
These compounds are also indicated to be of use for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of other diseases including Type I diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, syndrome X, insulin resistance, heart failure, diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis. In addition, these compounds are indicated to be useful for the regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders such as obesity, anorexia bulimia, and anorexia nervosa.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.<br><br>
The invention further provides a compound of Formula (I), or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for use in therapy, and in particular, in human medicine.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of Formula (I), or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions where modification of the effects of PPAR-gamma is of therapeutic benefit.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided herein a method for the treatment of a mammal, including man, in particular in the treatment conditions where modification of the effects of PPAR-gamma is of therapeutic benefit, the method comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02 - 5000 mg per day, e.g., 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.<br>
While it is possible that compounds of the present invention may be therapeutically administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, the present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula (I), or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to<br><br>
the recipient thereof. There is further provided by the present invention a process of preparing a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula (I), or (la), which process comprises admixing a compound of formula (I), or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor, and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.<br>
Formulations of the present invention include those especially formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral, transdermal, inhalation, intranasal, transmucosal, implant, or rectal administration, however, oral administration is preferred. For buccal administration, the formulation may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example, lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and preservatives such as methyl or propyl fi-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. Such preparations may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br><br>
Additionally, formulations of the present invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water) before use.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (as an emulsion in an acceptable oil, for example), ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives as a sparingly soluble salt, for example.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may contain between 0.1 - 99% of the active ingredient, conveniently from 30 - 95% for tablets and capsules and 3 - 50% for liquid preparations.<br>
There is further provided by the present invention processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I). Unless otherwise indicated, A, B, Alk, R1 and Z (and the further substituents represented thereby) are substantially as hereinbefore described.<br>
According to a general process (A), a compound of formula (I) may be prepared from a compound of formula (II)<br><br><br>

It will therefore be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that compounds which fall within general formula (I), may in some instances, be hereinafter described in the intermediate section, as they are useful for the preparation of other compounds of formula (I).<br>
For any of the general processes and schemes described above, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups . Protecting groups are employed according to standard methods of organic synthesis (T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts (1991) Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons). These groups are removed at a convenient stage of synthesis using methods known from the art. Thus, for example, amino groups may be protected by a group selected from aralkyl (e.g. benzyl), acyl, or sulfonyl, e.g. allylsulfonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, phthalimide, or tosyl; subsequent removal of the protecting group being effected when desired by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis as appropriate using standard conditions. Thus, for example, tert-butoxycarbonyl groups may be removed by hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may be protected using any conventional hydroxyl or carboxyl protecting group. Examples of suitable hydroxyl and carboxyl protecting groups include groups selected from alkyl, e.g. methyl, tert-butyl, or methoxymethyl, aralkyl, e.g. benzyl, diphenylmethyl, or triphenylmethyl, heterocyclic groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, acyl. e.g. acetyl or benzoyl, and silyl groups such as trialkylsilyl, e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl. The hydroxyl protecting groups may be removed by conventional techniques. Thus, for example, alkyl, silyl, acyl, and heterocyclic groups may be removed by hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Aralkyl groups such as<br><br>
triphenylmethyl may similiarly be removed by hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Aralkyl groups such as benzyl may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a Noble metal catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal. Silyl groups may also conveniently be removed using a source of fluoride ions such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride.<br>
Many of the above reactions and synthetic routes can be done on solid support. For example, R1 in Formula (II) can represent a suitable solid phase support, for example, R1 can be a 2-chlorotritylchloride polystyrene resin. After performing the appropriate reactions, the desired compound of Formula (I) can be isolated by cleavage from the soid phase support.<br>

Denny et al., J.Med.Chem., 21(5), pp430-437 (1978)) (1.00 equiv., 1.00 wt.) and dimethoxyethane (5 volumes), were combined and heated to reflux overnight. 2-2.5 volumes of solvent were removed by distillation, and the suspension was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The product was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with 0.5 volumes of cold dimethoxyethane and dried under house vacuum overnight. This product (1.00 wt., 1.00 equiv.) was combined with 10% palladium on carbon, (0.10 wt), para-nitrotoluene (0.75 equiv., 0.27 wt.), and 1-butanol (8.0 - 12.0 volumes) and heated to vigorous reflux for four to eighteen hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The suspension was filtered hot, under nitrogen, through a celite plug, the pad was washed with hot 1-butanol (2-5 volumes) and the filtrate cooled to<br><br>
ambient temperature. After cooling, the crystals were collected by vacuum filtration, washed once with cold absolute ethanol, and air dried.<br>
Alternative Intermediate 117<br>
Intermediate 117, the acid analog of the methyl ester Intermediate 23, was prepared by the following alternative process. To a suspension of Intermediate 23 (1.00 equiv., 1.0 wt) in tetrahydrofuran (1.2 - 2.5 vol.) at 15-25°C was added a solution of sodium hydroxide (2.2 equiv., 0.24 wt) in water (1.2 -1.4 vol.) at a rate to keep the temperature less then 25°C. After addition was complete, the solution was warmed to 15-25°C and stirred until no starting material remains by TLC. 2-3 M Hydrochloric Acid (2.2 - 2.6 equiv., 2.7-3.3 vol.) was added until a pH of 
Intermediate 167<br>
The mesylate analog of the oxazole alcohol from Maybridge, was prepared using the following process. To a suspension of 2-(5-methyl-2-phenyloxazol-4-yl)ethanol, (commercially available from Maybridge), (1.0 eq, 1.0 wt) in toluene (10 vol) and triethylamine (1.1 eq, 0.75 vol) at 20 - 25 °C was added methanesulfonyl chloride (1.1 eq, 0.42 vol) at a rate which allowed the temperature to rise to 40 °C. After the addition was complete the reaction was allowed to cool to 20 - 25 °C over 1 h. The organic phase was washed with water (3.5 vol) and brine (1.2 vol). The resulting solution was concentrated to 5 volumes, and stirred at 25 °C until crystallization commenced. Heptane (5 vol) was added to complete crystallization, and the mixture<br><br>
was stirred at 25°C for 1h. The solids were collected by filtration, washed with heptane (4.0 vol) and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C.<br>

The compound of Example 29 was prepared by the following alternative method. To a slurry of the phenol, Intermediate 117, (1.0 eq, 1.0 wt), in dimethylsulfoxide (1.0 vol)/water (2.0 vol) was added solid NaOH (2.4 eq, 0.26 wt). The resulting solution was stirred at 50 °C and a solution of the mesylate, Intermediate 167 (1.28 eq, 1.0 wt), in dimethylsulfoxide (3.0 vol) was added dropwise at a rate to maintain a temperature of 48 - 52 °C. This mixture was stirred at 48 - 52 °C for 22 hours, cooled to 25 °C, and washed three times with methyl tert-butyl ether (6.0 vol). The aqueous phase was diluted first with ethanol (2.0 vol), followed by glacial acetic acid (2.0 vol), and then water (6.0 vol) was added dropwise to the solution with vigorous stirring. Seed crystals were added when the solution became turbid and cloudy. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water (6.0 vol), then ethanol:water/50:50 (12.0 vol) and vacuum dried at 50 °C. The resulting yellow solid was recrystallized from ethanol:water/95:5 (18.0 vol), and vacuum dried to constant weight at 50 °C.<br>
Second Alternative Example 29<br>
The compound of Example 29 was prepared by the following second alternative method. To a mixture of phenol ester, Intermediate 23, (1 wt) 2-(5-methyl-2-phenyloxazol-4-yl)ethanol, (commercially available from Maybridge) (0.65 wt), and triphenylphosphine (0.88 wt) in toluene (3.5 vol) at 40°C was added a solution of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (0.66 vol) in toluene (0.5 vol) dropwise at such a rate to keep the temperature between 40 and 50 °C. After the reaction was complete (HPLC) the resulting solution was concentrated under vacuum at 50°C by removing toluene (2 vol), allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with methyl tert-butyl ether (4 vol) and chilled to 0 °C. After 1 hour at 0 °C the mixture was filtered to<br><br>
remove triphenylphosphine oxide and the filter pad was washed with cold (0 °C) methyl tert-butyl ether (2 vol). The resulting solution was washed with 2.5N NaOH (2.5 vol, 0 °C). 2.5 N NaOH (2.5 vol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until hydrolysis was complete (HPLC). Dimethyl sulfoxide (5 vol) was added and the phases separated. The aqueous phase was washed with methyl tert-butyl ether (3 vol), diluted first with ethanol (2.0 vol), followed by glacial acetic acid (2.0 vol), and then water (6.0 vol) was added dropwise to the solution with vigorous stirring. Seed crystals were added when the solution became turbid and cloudy. The resulting precipitate was filtered, then washed with ethanol:water/50:50 (6 vol). The resulting solids were slurried with hot ethanol:water/50:50 (6 vol) and filtered at 70°C. The resulting yellow solid was recrystallized from ethanol:water/95:5 (13.0 vol), and vacuum dried to constant weight at 50 °C.<br>
DEMONSTRATION OF EFFICACY OF COMPOUNDS<br>
PROTOCOLS<br>
1.	PPARgamma Transient Cotransfection Assay: The pSG5-mPPARg and pSG5-<br>
hPPARg chimeric receptor expression plasmids and the (UAS)5-tk-CAT reporter<br>
plasmid have been previously described (Kliewer, S. A., et. al. Cell 83, 813-819<br>
(1995); J. M. Lehmann et. al., J. Blol. Chem. 12953-12956, 270 (1995)).  Transient<br>
cotransfection assays using these plasmids were performed as previously described<br>
(Kliewer, S. A., et. al. Cell 83, 813-819 (1995); J. M. Lehmann et. al., J. Blol. Chem.<br>
12953-12956, 270 (1995)).<br>
2.	hPPARgamma Ligand Binding Assay: The PPAR-gamma ligand binding domain<br>
(amino acids 195-475) was expressed with an N-terminal 10x-histidine tag in E. coli<br>
cells. The cells were lysed and receptor was purified by means of the epitope tag.<br>
The stock solution of protein was diluted to 200 nM in assay buffer (50mM Tris,<br>
50mM KCI, pH 8 20mM CHAPS, 2mM EDTA 10mM DTT (Fresh)) just before use.<br>
Test compounds were prepared as 6mM stock solutions in DMSO. Two sequential 10-fold dilutions were made into assay buffer to give compound and DMSO concentrations of 60 uM and 1%, respectively. 12.5 uL of the diluted compound was added to a well in the left-most column of a microtiter plate<br><br>
containing 67.5 uL of assay buffer, the contents of the well were mixed, and 25 uL of this solution was transferred to the next well where it was mixed with 50 uL of assay buffer (3-fold dilution). This process was repeated to give a total of eleven (11) concentrations arrayed row-wise in the 96 well plate for each test compound. The right-most column of wells was used for controls. For each experiment, an appropriate amount of 3H-BRL 49,653 was blown to dry ness in a glass vial, resuspended in assay buffer (50mM Tris, 50mM KCI, pH 8 20mM CHAPS, 2mM EDTA 10mM DTT (Fresh)) to give a 400 nM concentration, vortexed, and sonicated for 10 seconds. Radioligand ([3H]-BRL 49,653) and receptor was added to each well of the plate containing test compound. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2hrs, and then cooled on ice for 30 minutes. 50 uL samples from each well of a single test plate were simultaneously loaded onto an equilibrated AGTC 96 well gel filtration block (Advanced Genetics Technology Corp.) using a Zymak Rapidplate automated pipettor. The block was placed on top of a clean microtiter plate and centrifuged @1,100 X g for 4 min. 200 uL of scintillation fluid was added to each well, the plates were sealed and allowed to equilibrate for at least 4 hours before counting in a Wallac 1250 Microbeta counter.<br>
Nonspecific binding as assessed by control wells containing an excess of [3H]-BRL 49,653 was subtracted from all wells and plots of compound concentration versus CPM bound were constructed. Ki's were determined from a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to a simple competitive binding model. For the purposes of data analysis, a Kd for [3H]-BRL 49,653 of 200 nM was utilized.<br>
3. In vivo Evaluation: Experiments were performed on db/db mice (n=40-48), approximately 60 day old, divided into either vehicle or treatment groups. From each group 8-12 animals were placed in Nalgene metabolic cages, 2 per cage. The remaining animals are housed in standard rack cages; 3-4 per cage. Test compounds were dissolved in an appropriate vehicle. Animals were administered either the vehicle or the compound (dose = 5 mg/kg) delivered at 5 ml/kg, b.i.d., via oral gavage for fourteen days. Daily measurements were made of mice housed in metabolic cages to determine consumption of food and water, urine output and urinary glucose excretion and changes in body weight. Animals housed in rack cages were weighed approximately every four days to monitor changes in body weight. An equal number of animals from each group were sampled on days 0, 4, 7 and 14. Mice were anesthetized with isolflurane, blood samples were obtained by<br><br>
cardiac puncture and analyzed to determine plasma levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA's).<br>
