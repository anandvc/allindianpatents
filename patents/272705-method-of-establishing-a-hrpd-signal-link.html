METHOD OF ESTABLISHING A HRPD SIGNAL LINK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of establishing an HRPD signal link,<br>
and more particularly to a method of establishing an alternate HRPD signaling link<br>
between the access terminal and the access network over a non-HRPD access and the<br>
pre-establishment of HRPD sessions over the alternate signaling link.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There is interest in developing multi-mode devices, capable of seamlessly<br>
transferring data, voice and video services from one radio technology to another one,<br>
without adversely affecting the user-experience.<br>
One such device is 3GPP2-EVDO interoperating with other wireless<br>
standards, such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), WLAN, WiMax, etc. This type<br>
of inter-technology handoffs is gaining special attention, as there is keen interest in<br>
integrating different air-interface technologies. Also as major cellular operators<br>
migrate to 4G and newer operators in broadband space emerge, multi-mode radio<br>
devices will be needed for both intra-operator as well as inter operator roaming for<br>
the foreseeable future as 4G technologies mature.<br>
A real-time data-session, for example, a VoIP call, that is initiated on one<br>
technology, such as LTE, may move or roam into an area where only HRPD is<br>
available. It becomes necessary to transfer the VoIP call from LTE to HRPD<br>
seamlessly and without a long delay.<br>
However, the HRPD requires that a session is established, before it is allowed<br>
to make/receive any type of calls. The initialization and session establishment of<br>
HRPD includes the following steps, which requires signaling exchanges between a<br>
mobile device and the HRPD network: 1. Unicast Access Terminal Identifier (UATI)<br><br>
assignment procedure, 2. HRPD session establishment procedure, 3. Access<br>
Authentication, 4. Point-to-point protocol (PPP) set-up, and 5. IP-setup as a<br>
preparation for a future handoff to HRPD. However, the complexity and cost<br>
constraints limit the mobile device to have typically, one transmitter antenna, which is<br>
standard industry practice today.<br>
In the example detailed above, this would require that there is an additional<br>
transmitter available for signaling exchanges for initialization and session<br>
establishment, while the device is actively transmitting and receiving on the other<br>
radio-interface.<br>
This invention proposes a method and solution to perform the initialization<br>
and session-establishment procedure of HRPD, from a mobile active on a non-HRPD<br>
network or other air-interface, such as LTE, WLAN, WiMax, etc., so as to minimize<br>
the disruption and packet loss during handoff or transfer to HRPD network, free of<br>
having to use two transmitter antennas.<br>
Thus, there is a need to perform the initialization and session-establishment<br>
procedure of HRPD, from a mobile active on a non-HRPD air-interface (by way of<br>
example, this term includes LTE, WLAN, WiMax and the like), so as to minimize the<br>
disruption and packet loss during handoff or transfer to the HRPD air-interface, which<br>
is cost effective, quick or user friendly and free from requiring use of two transmitter<br>
antennas, for example.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a method 10 of establishing an alternate HRPD<br>
signaling link between an HRPD access network and an access terminal over a non-<br>
HRPD access, is shown. The method 10 generally includes a providing step 12, an<br>
establishing step 14, an exchanging step 16, an identifying step 18 and a forwarding<br>
step 20. In more detail, the method 10 includes: providing 12 a signal forwarding<br>
function (SFF) 22 between an access terminal (AT) 24 and a high rate packet data<br>
(HRPD) access network (AN) 26; establishing 14 a data tunnel 28 between the access<br>
terminal 24 and the SFF 22; exchanging 16 HRPD signaling messages and HRPD<br>
data via the data tunnel 28; identifying 18 the HRPD access network 26 and the<br>
access terminal 24 over non-HRPD access by the SFF 22, by reading a header<br>
comprising HRPD sector identification, access terminal identification and stream<br>
identification and mapping the header to an address of one of the access terminal and<br>
the access network; and forwarding 20 the HRPD signaling messages and the HRPD<br>
data that arrive at the SFF 22 from the access terminal 24 and the HRPD access<br>
network 26 to the HRPD access network 26 and the access terminal 24, respectively.<br>
Advantageously, the method 10 performs an initiation and session establishment<br><br>
procedure, minimizes the time, disruption and packet loss during handoff to a HRPD<br>
access network and enables seamless mobility.<br>
In more detail, the method 10 performs the initiation and session establishment<br>
procedure for HRPD. For example, in use an AT 24, such as a mobile, would by<br>
active on a non-HRPD access (such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), wireless<br>
local area network (WLAN), and WIMax). The method 10 is adapted to minimize the<br>
time, disruption and packet loss during handoff to a HRPD access network and<br>
maximize user's experiences. In one embodiment, the HRPD signaling messages are<br>
over a TCP/IP link, with a newly defined header to uniquely identify the HRPD<br>
Access Network. In addition, the method 10 is particularly adapted for use in multi-<br>
mode devices or access terminals, with HRPD as one of the access technologies.<br>
Stated another way, the method 10 provides seamless mobility between HRPD and<br>
non-HRPD air-interface technologies.<br>

In one embodiment, the method 20 includes pre-establishing an HRPD session<br>
over a non-HRPD access prior to establishing a traffic channel on an HRPD air-<br>
interface. In order to perform a handoff between non-HRPD access and HRPD access,<br>
it is required that an HRPD session be established before the handoff (at a suitable<br>
radio-frequency). A problem in real time services like Voice over IP (VoIP) is that<br>
the HRPD session establishment takes a period of time, in the order of seconds, which<br>
can introduce an unacceptable break in communication. In order to support low-<br>
latency (low set up time) active session handoffs between non-HRPD and HRPD<br>
access, the method 20 provides a solution and effective procedures, to pre-establish<br><br>
the HRPD session, while on the non-HRPD access, before the radio frequency<br>
antenna switches from non-HRPD access to HRPD access.<br>
The term HRPD access as used herein, includes at least one of HRPD air-<br>
interface, HRPD access network, wherein access network includes a radio network<br>
controller, base station(s) and the like and HRPD core-network, wherein the core-<br>
network includes Packet Data Service Network (PDSN), Mobile IP Home agent.<br>
Mobile IP foreign agent and the like and the term non-HRPD access as used herein,<br>
includes at least one of non-HRPD air-interface, non-HRPD access network and non-<br>
HRPD core-network.<br>
In one embodiment, the method 20 includes authenticating and pre-<br>
establishing an HRPD session from a HRPD multi-mode access terminal, (wherein<br>
the HRPD multi-mode access terminal is a mobile device, which implements one or<br>
more than one access technology in addition to HRPD access technology) active on a<br>
non-HRPD access, prior to establishing a traffic channel on an HRPD air-interface.<br>
Preferably, this includes obtaining UATI assignment, protocol subtype negotiation<br>
and protocol configuration parameters negotiation of all protocol layers of HRPD,<br>
prior to establishing a traffic channel. In order to perform an active session handoff<br>
between non-HRPD and HRPD, it may be required that access terminal obtain UATI<br>
from the access network by means of UATI assignment, negotiate the protocol<br>
subtypes and protocol configuration parameters between the HRPD access network<br>
and the access terminal. However, these procedures can take an unacceptable period<br>
of time (negative user experience) and can cause an unacceptable break in<br>
communication, in known real time services like VoIP. As used above, active session<br>
means the access terminal is sending and receiving user data on a dedicated radio<br>
connection.<br>
Advantageously, in order to support low latency (break in communication<br>
reduced to a minimum) active session handoff between non-HRPD and HRPD access,<br>
the method includes establishing effective procedures to obtain the HRPD UATI,<br>
HRPD protocol subtypes and configuration parameters while on the non-HRPD<br>
access, before the radio frequency antenna switches from non-HRPD access to the<br>
HRPD access<br><br>
In one embodiment, the data tunnel in FIG. 1, is secure in order to minimize<br>
the possibility of a security attack on the access network as well as to protect the<br>
privacy of the access terminal.<br>
In another embodiment, the method includes the step of allowing HRPD<br>
access channel messaging from and to a non-HRPD air-interface access terminal. This<br>
feature can reduce the time it takes to perform a handoff from a non-HRPD network<br>
to a HRPD network, for example. In this embodiment, it is desirable that the access<br>
procedures that are required on HRPD to obtain HRPD traffic channel be bypassed,<br>
thus advantageously improving the user experience during handoff.<br>
As should be understood by those skilled in the art, an access network can<br>
include a base station controller, radio network controller, a plurality of the preceding<br>
and the like. It is understood that, a base station provides a Radio Frequency (RF)<br>
interface between an access terminal and an access network via one or more<br>
transceivers. An access network exchanges the signaling messages with a HRPD<br>
access terminal in order to establish the session, maintenance of session and so on.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method can include: providing an interface<br>
between the access terminal and SFF; and providing an interface between the SFF and<br>
access network. In this embodiment, the SFF can be defined as a stand alone module<br>
or feature, in order to ease the access network implementation and the scalability<br>
based on access network loading and operator network layout. Advantageously, the<br>
interface between the Access Terminal and SFF, can support interoperability between<br>
different access terminal vendors and SFF vendors. Likewise, the interface defined as<br>
being between the SFF and HRPD access network provides and supports<br>
interoperability between different HRPD access network vendors and SFF vendors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method includes: mapping of the HRPD access<br>
terminal identification to the IP address assigned by the non-HRPD network. In order<br>
to keep the non-HRPD network free of having to process the HRPD specific<br>
information, it is important to use a generic transport mechanism over the data tunnel<br>
established between the access terminal and the SFF, and TCP/IP provides such an<br>
option. It is necessary that the identification used for identifying the access terminal in<br>
the HRPD access be mapped to the TCP/IP domain, where IP addresses are used. This<br>
feature enables this function.<br><br>
Also in a preferred embodiment, the method includes routing encapsulated<br>
messages by SFF over IP by mapping SectorID to the 1P address of the HRPD access<br>
network. The HRPD signaling messages that arrive at the SFF, from the access<br>
terminal need to be forwarded to the HRPD access network, and the HRPD signaling<br>
messages that arrive at the SFF from the access network need to be forwarded to the<br>
access terminal. However, having one SFF for every HRPD access network is<br>
impractical. It is desirable to have one SFF serve many HRPD access networks. This<br>
feature maps the Identity of the HRPD network, which is identified by the SectorlD<br>
uniquely to an IP address of the HRPD network that is reachable within the access<br>
network.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, this figure illustrates a HRPD IOS Architecture, as<br>
defined in the HRPDIOS standard for 3GPP2, A.S0008 in phantom, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Fig. 3 also includes a Signal Forwarding Function.<br>
Advantageously, the SFF in the context of this figure and application provides quick<br>
and reliable handoffs between HRPD and non-HRPD, as well as a cost effective<br>
solution. In more detail, in order to pre-establish a HRPD session (by exchanging the<br>
HRPD signaling messages and data over a non-HRPD access), it is necessary that an<br>
alternate path is defined. The method and SFF provide: an alternate path such that the<br>
non-HRPD access does not have to process the HRPD specific information and the<br>
TCP/IP on a data tunnel over non-HRPD; HRPD signaling messages that are sent on<br>
TCP/IP over a non-HRPD, be routed to the right access network and access terminal;<br>
and translation from a TCP/IP domain to HRPD domain; and security to protect the<br>
access network from attack.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram for establishing an HRPD signal link over a non-<br>
HRPD air-interface over time, the diagram includes columns for each of the Access<br>
Terminal (AT), Signal Forwarding Function (SFF), Access Network (AN), Access<br>
Network-AAA (AN-AAA) and times a-h, illustrating how a link is opened.<br>
In more detail, items a through h provide a detailed flow over time and in<br>
sequence. At time a, the AT establishes an IP connection. The IP connection is<br>
established over a non-EVDO air interface. At time b, the AT sends<br>
AlternateLinkOpenReq message over the IP bearer to Signal Forwarding Function.<br>
The AlternateLinkOpenReq message contains the identity of the mobile station. At<br><br>
time c, the Signal Forwarding Function, upon getting the AltemateLinkOpenReq<br>
message obtains the Access Terminal credentials from the AN-AAA. At time d, the<br>
Signal Forwarding Function, triggers authentication of the mobile, in order to<br>
establish a secure data tunnel between Access Terminal and the Signal Forwarding<br>
Function. At time e, a secure data tunnel is created between the Signal Forwarding<br>
Function and the Access Terminal. At time f, a Signal Forwarding Function, sends the<br>
Axx-AlternateLinkOpenReq message to Access Network. At time g, the Access<br>
Network responds back to Signal Forwarding Function, with an Axx-<br>
AlternateLinkOpenResp message. At item h, the Signal Forwarding Function<br>
forwards an AlternateLinkOpenResp message to the Access Terminal. Advantages,<br>
This procedure advantageously provides an effective way of establishing an<br>
alternate signaling link, and preferably it can include means for a network to conduct<br>
authentication and establish a secure tunnel. In addition, it can include a mechanism<br>
provides an effective way of discovering if the access network supports the HRPD<br>
signaling over an alternate link, without having to inform the access network<br>
capability by explicit means, which could be time consuming and expensive.<br>
As used herein, Access Network-AAA (AN-AAA) means Access Network -<br>
Authentication, Authorization &amp; Accounting:<br>
Authentication refers to the confirmation that a user who is requesting services<br>
is a valid user of the network services requested. Authentication is accomplished via<br>
the presentation of an identity and credentials. Examples of types of credentials are<br>
passwords, one-time tokens, digital certificates, and phone numbers (calling/called).<br>
Authorization refers to the granting of specific types of service (including "no<br>
service") to a user, based on their authentication, what services they are requesting.<br>
and the current system state. Authorization may be based on restrictions, for example<br>
time-of-day restrictions, or physical location restrictions, or restrictions against<br>
multiple logins by the same user. Authorization determines the nature of the service<br>
which is granted to a user. Examples of types of service include, but are not limited<br>
to: IP address filtering, address assignment, route assignment, QoS/differential<br>
services, bandwidth control/traffic management, compulsory tunneling to a specific<br>

Accounting refers to the tracking of the consumption of network resources by<br>
users. This information may be used for management, planning, billing, or other<br>
purposes. Real-time accounting refers to accounting information that is delivered<br>
concurrently with the consumption of the resources. Batch accounting refers to<br>
accounting information that is saved until it is delivered at a later time. Typical<br>
information that is gathered in accounting is the identity of the user, the nature of the<br>
service delivered, when the service began and when it ended.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram for closing (or turning off) an HRPD signal link over<br>
a non-HRPD air-interface over time, the diagram includes columns for each of the<br>
Access Terminal (AT), Signal Forwarding Function (SFF), Access Network (AN).<br>
Access Network-AAA (AN-AAA) and times a-f, illustrating how a link is turned off.<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment and in more detail, at time a, the AT has already<br>
established a secure data tunnel between an Access Terminal and the Signal<br>
Forwarding Function (SFF). At time b, the AT sends AlternateLinkCloseReq<br>
messages to SFF, over the IP bearer. At time c, the Signal Forwarding Function, upon<br>
receiving the AlternateLinkCloseReq initiates a procedure to close the alternate link<br>
connection between the access terminal and the access network, and sends an Axx-<br>
AlternateLinkCloseReq message to the access network. At time d, the access network,<br>
responds back with Axx-AlternateLinkCloseResp message. At time e, the SFF<br>
completes the procedure to close the alternate link and sends AltemateLinkCloseResp<br>
to the access terminal. And, at time f, a secure data tunnel is closed between the<br>
access terminal and the SFF. As used herein, IP bearer refers to a data transport using<br>
TCP/IP as the mechanism for end-to-end transport protocol.<br>
This provides a reliable procedure for closing or turning off the alternate<br>
signaling link between the HRPD access network and the access terminal over non-<br>
HRPD air-interfaces, ensuring the synchronization of a Signaling Adaptation state<br>
machine running on access terminal and the access network, in one embodiment.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram showing HRPD signaling exchanges over a non-<br>
HRPD air-interface using TCP/IP over time, the diagram includes columns for each of<br>
the Access Terminal (AT), Signal Forwarding Function (SFF), Access Network (AN),<br>
Access Network-AAA (AN-AAA) and times a-c, accordance with the invention.<br><br>
In more detail and in a preferred embodiment, at time a, the AT has already<br>
established a secure data tunnel between Access Terminal and the Signal Forwarding<br>
Function (SFF). At time b, the AT sends AltemateLinkMessage messages to the SFF,<br>
over the IP bearer. The AltemateLinkMessage has an encapsulated HRPD signaling<br>
message, with the header information for the SFF to determine which Access<br>
Network this message should be forwarded to. And, at time c, the SFF, upon receiving<br>
the AltemateLinkMessage forwards the message to the appropriate access network.<br>
This provides a mechanism for exchanging the HRPD signaling messages and HRPD<br>
data transparently over non-HRPD access, without requiring the non-HRPD network<br>
to interpret and process the HRPD specific information<br>
Referring to Fig. 15, an alternate embodiment of a signaling adaptation<br>
method 50 for converting HRPD messages and HRPD data on to a generic container<br>
that can be transported over a non-HRPD access, is shown. The method 50, comprises<br>
the steps of: providing 52 a HRPD protocol including a Signal Adaptation Protocol<br>
(SAP) including an open state, set up state and a default closed state; requesting 54 an<br>
alternate HRPD signaling link over a non-HRPD access to be opened; activating 56<br>
the alternate HRPD signaling link upon entering the open state; adapting 58 (and<br>
encapsulating) the HRPD signaling messages and HRPD Radio Link Protocol (RLP)<br>
data on to a non-HRPD access; exchanging 60 HRPD signaling messages and HRPD<br>
data between the access terminal and the HRPD access network via the alternate<br>
HRPD signaling link, free of establishing an HRPD traffic channel; and identifying 62<br>
the HRPD access network and the access terminal over non-HRPD access by inserting<br>
a header comprising sector identification, stream identification and access terminal<br>
identification. The method performs an initiation and session establishment<br>
procedure, minimizes the time, disruption and packet loss during handoff to a HRPD<br>
access network and enables seamless mobility.<br>
Advantageously, the method provides a mechanism or process for exchanging<br>
HRPD signaling messages and HRPD data over the dedicated radio connection of<br>
non-HRPD technology which reduces the cost of development of a multimode access<br>
terminal capable of performing active session handoff between non-HRPD wireless<br>
technology and HRPD cellular technology.<br><br>
To provide context, to send or receive HRPD signaling messages according to<br>
known methods, such as in 3GPP2 C.S0024A, entitled "cdma2000 High Rate Packet<br>
Data Air Interface Specification", September 2006, a dedicated radio connection<br>
needs to be established. The dedicated radio connection is defined as a particular state<br>
of the air-link in which the AT is assigned a forward traffic channel, a reverse traffic<br>
channel and associated medium access control channels. In a multimode mobile<br>
device, wherein a HRPD wireless technology and a non-HRPD wireless technology is<br>
implemented, and when a non-HRPD is on a dedicated radio connection, it is<br>
expensive and redundant to have the HRPD technology also be on a dedicated radio<br>
connection simultaneously.<br>
In order for a multimode access terminal with one technology such as HRPD<br>
to perform active session handoff (where in active session means, the access terminal<br>
is sending and receiving user data on a dedicated radio connection) from non-HRPD<br>
wireless technology to HRPD wireless technology, it is required per 3GPP2<br>
C.S0024A, that an HRPD session be established, which includes HRPD signaling<br>
messages and HRPD data is exchanged on a dedicated radio connection between an<br>
access terminal and HRPD access network. However, having two dedicated radio<br>
connections would be expensive in implementation and technologically complicated.<br>
This method 50 provides a cost effective method and mechanism for<br>
exchanging HRPD signaling messages and HRPD data over a dedicated non-HRPD<br>
radio connection, which reduces the cost of development of a multimode access<br>
terminal capable of performing active session handoff between non-HRPD wireless<br>
technology and HRPD technology.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method 50 can further include providing pre-<br>
establishment of an HRPD session, HRPD point-to-point (PPP) and HRPD internet<br>
protocol (IP) session over a non-HRPD access, free of establishing an HRPD traffic<br>
channel. In order for a multimode access terminal with one technology such as HRPD<br>
to perform active session handoff from non-HRPD wireless technology to HRPD<br>
wireless technology, it is required under 3GPP2 C.S0024A, that an HRPD session,<br>
PPP session and an IP session be established, which includes HRPD signaling<br>
messages and HRPD data be exchanged on a dedicated radio connection between an<br>
access terminal and a HRPD access network. In a multimode mobile device, wherein<br><br>
HRPD wireless technology and a non-HRPD wireless technology is implemented and<br>
when a non-HRPD is on a dedicated radio connection, it would be costly and<br>
technologically redundant and use valuable air time to have the HRPD technology<br>
also be on the dedicated radio connection simultaneously. This pre-establishing<br>
feature allows a multimode access terminal the capability of performing active session<br>
handoff between non-HRPD wireless technology and HRPD cellular technology.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the method 50 includes performing<br>
traffic establishment free of a HRPD access channel procedure. This advantageously<br>
provides a means of transmitting HRPD access channel messages over the alternate<br>
link on a non-HRPD network, thus bypassing access channel procedures of HRPD to<br>
obtain a traffic channel.<br>
As context, current implementations, such as the HRPD 3GPP2 C.S0024A<br>
standard, requires access channel procedures, such as exchanging access channel<br>
messages, which introduce additional time in the active session handoff from non-<br>
HRPD to HRPD. Generally, access channel messages are sent in order to obtain a<br>
traffic channel assignment for a dedicated radio connection between a HRPD access<br>
network and an access terminal.<br>
To reduce the time it takes to perform active session handoff from a non-<br>
HRPD network to a HRPD network, in a preferred embodiment, the access channel<br>
messages are sent free of performing access procedures, thus effectively bypassing<br>
such procedures. This provides an effective handoff and an improvement to the user<br>
experience during handoff.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method 50 can include providing an alternate<br>
link open request message including an identity of the access terminal and the<br>
connection is an IP connection, as shown in FIGs. 12-14. This feature provides an<br>
beneficial procedure where an identity of the access terminal is sent in an Alternate<br>
Link Open Request message, such that the access network can validate the credentials<br>
of the access terminal and optionally perform authentication and validation<br>
procedures in order to ensure a secure communication link between the access<br>
terminal and the access network over a non HRPD network.<br>
FIG. 7 is an illustration of a Protocol Structure as defined by HRPD Standard<br>
IS856, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. It also shows a default<br><br>
signaling path, as detailed herein. The figure shows an HRPD layered architecture<br>
with a modular design that allows partial updates to protocols, software and<br>
independent protocol negotiation.<br>
Detailed below is a general discussion of the protocol stack layers shown in<br>
FIG. 7. Starting at the bottom right and moving up, the Physical Layer provides the<br>
channel structure, frequency, power output, modulation, and encoding specifications<br>
for the Forward and Reverse link channels and provides protocols to support the<br>
procedure. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer defines the protocol to support<br>
procedures that are used to receive and transmit over the Physical Layer. The Security<br>
Layer provides protocols to support authentication and encryption services. The<br>
Connection Layer provides protocols to support air link connection establishment and<br>
maintenance services. The Session Layer provides protocols to support protocol<br>
negotiation, protocol configuration, and session state maintenance services. The<br>
Stream Layer provides protocols to support multiplexing of distinct application<br>
streams. The Application Layer provides application protocols to support the Default<br>
Signaling Application for transporting HRPD protocol messages and the Default<br>
Packet Application for transporting user data. For more detail, refer to the HRPD<br>
Standard IS856.<br>
FIG. 8 is an environmental illustration showing the Protocol Structure as<br>
defined by HRPD Standard IS856, in Fig. 7, including a Signaling Adaptation<br>
Protocol (SAP) and signaling path in an opened (operational) position, in accordance<br>
with the invention. The SAP provides<br>
FIGs. 9, 10 and 11 show three embodiments of the Signaling Adaptation<br>
Protocol in Fig. 8 and exemplary signaling paths in an opened (operational) state.<br>
In one embodiment, the SNP protocol messages and the RLP packets are<br>
forwarded to the SAP, shown in the solid line signaling paths in FIG. 9.<br>
In order perform HRPD session establishment, free of establishing the<br>
dedicated radio communication between HRPD access network and a multimode<br>
access terminal, for example, this method advantageously provides a procedure for<br>
forwarding the signaling messages generated by all of the seven layers of the HRPD<br>
protocol stack to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol through the Signaling Network<br>
Protocol (SNP). Thus, by forwarding: 1.) the HRPD signaling messages generated by<br><br>
all the layers of HRPD to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol from the SNP (left solid<br>
line signal path in FIG. 9); and 2.) the HRPD data that is generated or passed through<br>
by the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol ( through the<br>
right signaling path in FIG. 9), this minimizes the technical impact on known<br>
implementations, such as the IS-56A HRPD standard. In addition,<br>
In FIGs. 9 and 10, a SAP state controlling a switch is shown, as a double-pole<br>
like switch, which provides two software connected switches, to allow a signal to<br>
follow the default path (in phantom, closed state) or operational state following the<br>
solid line signaling paths.<br>
In a second embodiment, as shown in FIG. 10, the Signaling Link Protocol-D<br>
(SLP-D) protocol messages and the RLP packets are forwarded to the SAP. In order<br>
perform HRPD session establishment, free of establishing the dedicated radio<br>
communication between HRPD access network and a multimode access terminal, this<br>
method advantageously provides a procedure for forwarding the signaling messages<br>
generated by all of the seven layers of the HRPD protocol stack to the Signaling<br>
Adaptation Protocol through the Signaling Network Protocol (SNP) and Signaling<br>
Link Protocol (SLP-D). By forwarding the HRPD signaling messages generated by<br>
all the layers of HRPD to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol, by the SLP, this frees the<br>
SAP to perform sequencing and retransmission of the signaling messages, and hence<br>
simplifies the Signaling Adaptation Protocol procedures. In addition, HRPD data that<br>
is generated or passed through by the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) is forwarded to the<br>
Signaling Adaptation Protocol.<br>
In a third embodiment, as shown in FIG. 11, packets of stream protocol arc<br>
forwarded to the SAP. In order to perform HRPD session establishment, free of<br>
establishing the dedicated radio communication between HRPD access network and a<br>
multimode access terminal, this method advantageously provides a procedure for<br>
forwarding the signaling messages generated by all of the seven layers of the HRPD<br>
protocol stack to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol through the Signaling Network<br>
Protocol (SNP) and Signaling Link Protocol (SLP-D) and the steam protocol. By<br>
forwarding the HRPD signaling messages generated by all the layers of HRPD to the<br>
Signaling Adaptation Protocol, by the stream protocol, frees the SAP to perform<br>
sequencing and retransmission of the signaling messages as well as the inclusion and<br><br>
interpretation of stream identifier, which further simplifies the Signaling Adaptation<br>
Protocol procedures. In addition, HRPD data that is generated or passed through by<br>
the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) is forwarded to the Signaling Adaptation Protocol<br>
through the stream protocol further simplifies the development of Signaling<br>
Adaptation Protocol.<br>
FIGs. 12 and 13 show Access Terminal and Access Network State Machines<br>
of the Signaling Adaptation Protocol, in Fig. 9 including a Closed State, Setup State<br>
and Open State, illustrating how an alternate link is opened. The method<br>
advantageously provides a procedure to effectively transition from a non-HRPD<br>
alternate link to a default HRPD signaling link and vice versa. The state transition and<br>
the messages defined in this method ensure an effective way of synchronizing a<br>
HRPD network and a multimode access terminal. In addition, another benefit of this<br>
feature is it provides a mechanism to determine the support of Signaling Adaptation<br>
Protocol or the Alternate Link Support by the access network, free of explicit<br>
signaling, which reduces the usage of radio frequency resources of the HRPD and<br>
non-HRPD wireless system.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flow diagram for establishing an HRPD signal link over a non-<br>
HRPD air-interface over time, the diagram includes columns for each of the Alternate<br>
Link, Signaling Network Protocol (SNP), Signaling Adaptation Protocol (SAP).<br>
Access Network (AN), and times a-1, in accordance with the invention. In	a<br>
preferred embodiment, the method 50 further includes providing a message sequence<br>
for requesting and activating the alternate link by the SAP. This feature<br>
advantageously provides a means to establish and adapt the HRPD signaling<br>
messages free of establishing a dedicated HRPD radio connection, in a cost effective<br>
manner. This method can also provide backward compatibility with HRPD access<br>
networks and mobile devices that are already implemented and deployed, such as<br>
under the 3GPP2-C.S0024A standard.<br>
In more detail, the flow diagram depicts the dynamic behavior of Signaling<br>
Adaptation Protocol in the context of other protocols already defined in the HRPD<br>
standard, C.S0024A. At time a, a mobile device powers up, At time b, a Signaling<br>
Network Protocol Activates the Signaling Adaptation Protocol. At time c, Signaling<br>
Adaptation Protocol initializes its local variables and enters a closed state. At time d.<br><br>
when a dedicated channel is available on an alternate link, SNP is informed about it.<br>
At time e, the SNP sets the availability on an alternate link to true. At time f, the SNP<br>
detects the need to send signaling messages to a network. It activates the signaling<br>
over Alternate Link by sending, SAP.AlternateLinkActivate. At time g, the SAP<br>
sends AlternateLinkOpenReq message to the network. At time h, the SAP enters a<br>
setup state and updates the appropriate variables. At time i, the Network sends an<br>
AlternateLinkOpenResp message, after it sets-up the signaling link over the alternate<br>
link. This can involve secure data-tunnel setup, etc. At time j, the SAP enters an open<br>
state and sets appropriate variables. At time k, the SAP sends<br>
SAP.AlternateLinkOpenlnd indication to the SNP. And at time 1, the SNP sets<br>
AlternateLinkOpen status to true.<br>
It should be understood that the inventive concepts disclosed herein are<br>
capable of many modifications. To the extent such modifications fall within the scope<br>
of the appended claims and their equivalents, they are intended to be covered by this<br>
patent application.<br><br>
