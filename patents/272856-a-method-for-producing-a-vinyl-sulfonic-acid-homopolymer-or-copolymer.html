				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
VINYL SULFONIC ACID, POLYMER THEREOF, AND PRODUCTION<br>
METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention mainly relates to a vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid, a polymer thereof, a production method<br>
thereof, an apparatus suitable for production thereof,<br>
and an electric/electronic material comprising the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid or polymer thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Vinyl sulfonic acids are attracting a great deal of<br>
attention as a monomer for constituting a functional<br>
polymer and a conductive material.<br>
[0003]<br>
However, commercially available vinyl sulfonic acids<br>
have a double bond content of 75 wt.% or less.<br>
Consequently, when the vinyl sulfonic acid was to be<br>
polymerized after impregnating in a porous substrate,<br>
polymerization did not proceed sufficiently and thus a<br>
product functioning as a proton conductive polymer could<br>
not be obtained.<br>
[0004]<br>
Patent Document 1 describes a vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
with a purity of 98%. However, the metal content is<br>
several ppm.<br>
[0005]<br>
Recently, vinyl sulfonic acids or polymers thereof<br>
are attracting attention as a component constituting<br>
functional polymers and conductive materials, and as a<br>
material for electronic devices and semiconductors.<br>
[0006]<br>
For example, a vinyl sulfonic acid or polymer<br>
thereof has been reported as being utilized in a resist<br>
resin composition (Patent Document 2), a resin<br>
composition for a resist protection film (Patent<br>
Documents 3 and 4), a CMP slurry (Patent Documents 5 and<br>
6), a separator for an alkali secondary battery (Patent<br>
Documents 7 and 8), a fuel cell electrolyte membrane<br>
(Patent Documents 1 and 9), a conductive polymer dopant<br>
(Patent Documents 10 and 11) and the like.<br>

[0007]<br>
However, many of these uses dislike metal or<br>
impurity contamination.<br>
[0008]<br>
For example, for a semiconductor material,<br>
impurities, especially metal impurities contained in the<br>
material, can cause problems such as contamination of the<br>
wafer by diffusing into the wafer interior during the<br>
wafer fabrication step. Further, metal contamination can<br>
induce deteriorated reliability of the dielectric film,<br>
current leakage, and abnormalities in film deposition and<br>
the like, and also have an substantial adverse impact on<br>
the semiconductor apparatus (see Patent Documents 12 to<br>
14) .<br>

150153<br>

Patent Document 14: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-<br>
250807<br>
[0009]<br>
Further, recently, from the perspectives that solid<br>
polymer fuel cells utilizing a polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane have a light burden on the environment and<br>
reduced carbon dioxide emissions, investigations are<br>
being carried out on their various applications, such as<br>
for automobiles and fixed household use.<br>
[0010]<br>
Conventionally, a perfluoroalkyl sulfonate-type<br>
polymer in which sulfonic acid groups are linked to side<br>
chains on a perfluoro skeleton has been used as such a<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane. Further, perfluoroalkyl<br>
sulfonate-type polymers which have undergone various<br>
improvements have been developed. However, since the<br>
polymer production process is complex, and a fluorinated<br>
hydrocarbon-based material, for which large cost<br>
reductions are not easy to achieve, is used, costs<br>
increase.<br>
[0011]<br>
Accordingly, hydrocarbon-based polymer electrolyte<br>
membranes which do not use a fluorine-based polymer and<br>
which have improved proton conductivity have been<br>
developed. Hydrocarbon-based polymer electrolyte<br>
membranes are easy to produce, can be applied in a large<br>
variety of molecular structures, and have easily-<br>
controlled physical properties. Further, from a<br>
recycling perspective, since hydrocarbon-based polymer<br>
electrolyte membranes do not contain a fluorine, they<br>
have the advantage of not producing harmful substances.<br>
[0012]<br>
However, hydrocarbon-based polymers have worse<br>
chemical stability than perfluoroalkyl sulfonate-type<br>
polymers. This is due to the fact that hydrogen and<br>
oxygen crossleak across the electrolyte membrane and<br>
react on the electrode catalyst to produce hydrogen<br>
peroxide, whereby radicals produced from this hydrogen<br>
peroxide cause the membrane to deteriorate. Further,<br>
iron ions act as a catalyst for promoting the oxidation<br>
ability of the hydrogen peroxide, so that the membrane<br>
deterioration is accelerated (see Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
Non-Patent Document 1: Fuel Cell Technology and<br>
Applications / Handbook of Fuel Cells, pp. 647-662, 2003<br>
[0013]<br>
However, a vinyl sulfonic acid or polymer thereof<br>
having a sufficiently reduced metal content is as yet<br>
unknown.<br>
[0014]<br>
On the other hand, various methods are known for<br>
producing a vinyl sulfonic acid (see Non-Patent Document<br>
2). For example, Patent Document 15 describes a method<br>
for producing a vinyl sulfonic acid by performing a<br>
sodium removal treatment on sodium vinyl sulfonate with<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
Further, Patent Document 16 describes a method for<br>
producing a vinyl sulfonic acid by dehydrating isethionic<br>
acid using diphosphate pentoxide or pyrophosphoric acid<br>
as a dehydrating agent.<br>
[0015]<br>
However, in the above-described methods, a product<br>
having sufficient quality cannot be obtained.<br>

[0055]<br>
In the present specification, unless stated<br>
otherwise, "ppm" refers to "weight ppm" and "ppb" refers<br>
to "weight ppb".<br>
[0056]<br>
1. Vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
(1) Double bond content<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present<br>
invention has a double bond content of 95 wt.% or more,<br>
especially 97 wt.% or more, and more especially 99 wt.%<br>
or more.<br>
[0057]<br>
In the present invention, "double bond content"<br>
means a value determined by quantifying an amount of<br>
double bonds and calculating this in terms of a purity of<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acid, or in other words, multiplying a<br>
number of moles of double bonds in 100 g of the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid by 1 gram equivalent of the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid.<br>
[0058]<br>
A double bond content can be determined from the<br>
following formula based on a measured iodine value.<br>
Double bond content (wt.%) = (iodine value) x<br>
(108.1/2) / 126.9<br>
(Here, 108.1 is the molecular weight of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid, and 126.9 is the atomic weight of iodine.)<br>
[0059]<br>

The vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present<br>
invention has a (i) sodium (Na) content of 1 ppm or less,<br>
preferably 500 ppb or less, and especially preferably 300<br>
ppb or less. Further, the vinyl sulfonic acid according<br>
to the present invention has (ii) a content of at least<br>
one metal selected from the group consisting of alkali<br>
earth metal and first row transition metal of 1 ppm or<br>
less, preferably 800 ppb or less, and especially<br>
preferably 500 ppb or less.<br>
[0060]<br>
Especially, the vinyl sulfonic acid according to the<br>
present invention has a (i) sodium (Na) content of 100<br>
ppb or less, preferably 50 ppb or less, and especially<br>
preferably 10 ppb or less. Further, the vinyl sulfonic<br>

consisting of alkali earth metal and first row transition<br>
metal of 100 ppb or less, preferably 50 ppb or less, and<br>
especially preferably 20 ppb or less.<br>
[0061]<br>
Examples of alkali earth metal include calcium (Ca).<br>
[0062]<br>
Examples of first row transition metal include iron<br>
(Fe), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni).<br>
[0063]<br>
An example of a preferred vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
according to the present invention has:<br>
(i) a sodium (Na) content of 1 ppm or less,<br>
(ii) a calcium (Ca) content of 1 ppm or less, and<br>
(iii) a content of at least one metal selected from<br>
first row transition metal of 1 ppm or less.<br>
[0064]<br>
An example of a more preferred vinyl sulfonic acid<br>

[0066]<br>
An example of an even more especially preferred<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid has:<br>
(i) a sodium (Na) content of 100 ppb or less,<br>
(ii) a calcium (Ca) content of 100 ppb or less, and<br>
(iii) a content of the metals iron (Fe), chromium<br>
(Cr), and nickel (Ni) of 100 ppb or less, respectively.<br>
[0067]<br>
Further, it is also preferred that the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid has a low lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg),<br>
aluminum (Al), potassium (K) , manganese (Mn), copper (Cu),<br>
zinc (Zn), zirconium (Zr), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb)<br>
content, respectively. A vinyl sulfonic acid having a<br>
respective content of these metals of about 100 ppb or<br>
less, and preferably about 50 ppb or less, can be<br>
preferably used.<br>
[0068]<br>
The metal content can be measured based on a well-<br>
known method. For example, methods such as ICP mass<br>
spectrometry (ICP-MS), ICP emission spectrometric<br>
analysis (ICP-OES / ICP-AES), and atomic adsorption<br>
spectrometry can be used. Generally, it is preferred to<br>
use ICP-MS.<br>
[0069]<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present<br>
invention has reduced impurity and metal contents, and<br>
can be preferably used as a material for an<br>
electric/electronic material. In other words, the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid according to the present invention can be<br>
preferably used as a material in a production of an<br>
electric/electronic material.<br>
[0070]<br>
Examples of an electric material include a fuel cell<br>
electrolyte membrane, an organic EL thin film, and a<br>
battery peripheral material. Examples of an electronic<br>
material include a semiconductor peripheral material, a<br>
conductive polymer material, and a circuit board material.<br>
[0071]<br>
For example, a homopolymer formed by impregnating<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acid in a substrate and then carrying<br>
out homopolymerization, or a copolymer formed by<br>
impregnating the vinyl sulfonic acid in a substrate and<br>
then copolymerizing with another polymerizable monomer,<br>
can be used as a fuel cell polymer electrolyte.<br>
[0072]<br>
Further, the vinyl sulfonic acid, or a homopolymer<br>
formed by polymerizing just this vinyl sulfonic acid or a<br>
copolymer formed by copolymerizing the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid with another polymerizable monomer, can be used as a<br>
material for a photoresist composition, a polymer binder<br>
or a separator for a battery. In addition, the product<br>
obtained by polymerization of the vinyl sulfonic acid can<br>
be used as an anionic polymer acid dispersant in a<br>
polishing slurry for semiconductor fabrication, or as a<br>
conductive polymer dopant used in an EL device, such as<br>
an organic light-emitting diode (OLED).<br>
[0073]<br>
2. Vinyl sulfonic acid production method<br>
A method for producing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
according to the present invention is not especially<br>
limited, as long as the vinyl sulfonic acid has the<br>
above-described characteristics. Vinyl sulfonic acids<br>
obtained by the following production methods are<br>
preferred.<br>
[0074]<br>
Production method 1: A method for producing the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid, comprisng a step of subjecting a<br>
vinyl sulfonate to a metal removal treatment, wherein the<br>
metal removal rate in the metal removal treatment<br>
represented by the following formula is 95% or more:<br>
Metal removal rate (%) = {(acid value after metal<br>
removal treatment) / (acid value before metal removal<br>
treatment)} x 100.<br>
[0075]<br>
Production method 2: A method for producing the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid, comprisng a step of subjecting a<br>
vinyl sulfonate to a metal removal treatment, wherein the<br>
metal removal treatment is carried out using a strongly-<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin.<br>
[0076]<br>
Production method 3: The production method according<br>
to the above-described production method 1 or 2, further<br>
comprisng a step of purifying the product obtained from<br>
the metal removal treatment using a thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus.<br>
[0077]<br>
Production method 4: The production method according<br>
to the above-described production method 3, wherein the<br>
thin-film distillation apparatus is an apparatus in which<br>
all or a part of a contact with the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
or a composition thereof are formed from a material<br>
having a high corrosion resistance.<br>
[0078]<br>
Production method 5: The production method according<br>
to the above-described production method 3, wherein the<br>
thin-film distillation apparatus is an apparatus in which<br>
all or a part of a contact with the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
or a composition thereof are made from tantalum.<br>
[0079]<br>
Production method 6: The production method according<br>
to the above-described production method 4 or 5, wherein<br>
the thin-film distillation apparatus comprises:<br>
a distillation tower for evaporating a distillation<br>
raw material;<br>
a vinyl sulfonic acid vapor outlet which is provided<br>
in a middle section of the distillation tower; and<br>
a cooling device which is arranged externally to the<br>
distillation tower for condensing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
vapor obtained from the outlet.<br>
[0080]<br>
Examples of the raw material vinyl sulfonate include<br>
sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, or a<br>
mixture thereof. Of these, it is especially preferred to<br>
use sodium vinyl sulfonate.<br>
[0081]<br>
The vinyl sulfonate may be provided in the form of a<br>
composition. For example, in addition to a vinyl<br>
sulfonate, a composition including an isethionate or a<br>
salt of a bis-sulfoethyl ether may also be used as the<br>
raw material. When using a composition, a ratio of the<br>
vinyl sulfonate based on the whole composition is<br>
generally about 25 wt.% or more.<br>
[0082]<br>
The term "metal removal treatment" refers to a<br>
treatment in which metal is removed from the vinyl<br>
sulfonate and substituted with hydrogen. In other words,<br>
the term "metal removal treatment" refers to a treatment<br>
in which metal ions are removed from the vinyl sulfonate,<br>
which is converted into a vinyl sulfonic acid.<br>
[0083]<br>
The metal removal treatment step can be illustrated<br>
by the following general formula.<br>
CH2=CHS03M -&gt; CH2=CHS03H<br>
(wherein M represents a metal to form a salt,<br>
specifically, sodium, potassium and the like)<br>
[0084]<br>
The metal removal rate is preferably 95% or more,<br>
especially preferably 97% or more, and more especially<br>
preferably 99% or more.<br>
[0085]<br>
The metal removal rate refers to a value calculated<br>
by the following formula.<br>
Metal removal rate (%) = { (acid value after metal removal<br>
treatment) / (acid value before metal removal treatment)}<br>
x 100.<br>
[0086]<br>
Stated another way, the metal removal rate is the<br>
rate of the metal contained in the raw material converted<br>
into hydrogen. For example, if a sodium salt is used as<br>
the raw material, the metal removal rate is the<br>
conversion rate from sodium into hydrogen (the sodium<br>
conversion rate) . Stated even another way, the metal<br>
removal rate is the rate of the decrease of the metal<br>
salt compound contained in the raw material.<br>
[0087]<br>
The metal removal rate may be determined by<br>
measuring an acid value based on a known method. For<br>
example, the metal removal rate may be determined by<br>
measuring an acid value based on neutralization titration.<br>
[0088]<br>
If the metal removal rate is 95% or more, the<br>
degradation of the compound or impact thereof is<br>
substantially reduced. Further, this also allows the<br>
introduction of thin-film distillation into the<br>
purification step carried out after the metal removal<br>
treatment, thereby enabling large-scale distillation to<br>
be carried out at a high recovery rate. In addition, a<br>
high-quality vinyl sulfonic acid can be obtained, which<br>
allows a vinyl sulfonic acid having little discoloration<br>
when it is distilled off in the distillation step to be<br>
obtained. Moreover, a vinyl sulfonic acid which hardly<br>
changes in color over time can be obtained.<br>
[0089]<br>
The metal removal treatment method is not especially<br>
limited, although it is preferred to use a strongly-<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin. In other words, it is<br>
preferred to carry out the metal removal treatment by<br>
bringing the vinyl sulfonate into contact with the<br>
strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin.<br>
[0090]<br>
The method for bringing the vinyl sulfonate into<br>
contact with the strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin can<br>
be carried out by a common method. However, it is<br>
preferred to fill the ion-exchange resin into a column<br>
and pass an aqueous solution of the vinyl sulfonate<br>
therethrough, as this allows ion exchange to be performed<br>
reliably.<br>
[0091]<br>
The type of the strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin<br>
is not especially limited, as long as the advantageous<br>
effects of the present invention can be enjoyed. A known<br>
ion-exchange resin may be appropriately selected. For<br>
example, a compound having a strong acid group on a side<br>
chain of a crosslinked insoluble organic polymer compound<br>
can be used. Examples of the strong acid group include a<br>
sulfuric acid group, a phosphoric acid group, and a<br>
sulfonic acid group.<br>
[0092]<br>
Specific examples of the strongly-acidic ion-<br>
exchange resin include Diaion (registered trademark)<br>
(SK1B, SK116, PK216 etc.), Amberlite (registered<br>
trademark) (IR-120B, IR-124 etc.), Dowex (registered<br>
trademark) (50wx8, HCR-S, Monosphere 650C etc.), and<br>
Lewatit (registered trademark) (S-100 etc.).<br>
[0093]<br>
By carrying out the metal removal treatment using<br>
the strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin, the vinyl<br>
sulfonate content can be reduced by a high ratio,<br>
degradation of the compound can be suppressed, and the<br>
yield can be improved.<br>
[0094]<br>
Further, a vinyl sulfonic acid having excellent<br>
quality and hardly any discoloration can be obtained.<br>
[0095]<br>
Further, by using the strongly-acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin, the metal removal treatment can be carried out<br>
efficiently with just one treatment.<br>
[0096]<br>
In addition, this also allows the introduction of<br>
thin-film distillation into the subsequent purification<br>
step, thereby enabling large-scale distillation to be<br>
carried out.<br>
[0097]<br>
From perspectives such as reducing a generation of<br>
gases and further improving a recovery rate in the<br>
distillation, the metal removal rate in the metal removal<br>
treatment using the strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin is<br>
preferably 95% or more, especially preferably 97% or more,<br>
and more especially preferably 99% or more.<br>
[0098]<br>
It is preferred to further purify the treated<br>
product obtained from the metal removal treatment by a<br>
known method. The term "product obtained from the metal<br>
removal treatment" means the product obtained by<br>
performing the metal removal treatment on the vinyl<br>
sulfonate or composition thereof. Specifically, this<br>
term means the vinyl sulfonic acid or composition thereof<br>
obtained from the metal removal treatment.<br>
[0099]<br>
The purification method can be appropriately set<br>
from among known methods. However, purification carried<br>
out by distillation, especially thin-film distillation,<br>
is preferred.<br>
[0100]<br>
By carrying out the purification by thin-film<br>
distillation, a vinyl sulfonic acid can be obtained which<br>
has excellent quality, little discoloration when it is<br>
distilled off, and hardly any problems with discoloration<br>
over time. Further, this also enables large-scale<br>
purification to be carried out at a high recovery rate.<br>
[0101]<br>
Especially, it is preferred to carry out<br>
purification by thin-film distillation of the treated<br>
product obtained from the metal removal treatment carried<br>
out so that the metal removal rate of the vinyl sulfonate<br>
is 95% or more.<br>
[0102]<br>
Further, it is preferred to carry out purification<br>
by thin-film distillation of the treated product obtained<br>
from the metal removal treatment carried out by bringing<br>
the vinyl sulfonate into contact with the strongly-acidic<br>
ion-exchange resin.<br>
[0103]<br>
Especially, it is preferred to subject the treated<br>
product obtained from the metal removal treatment, which<br>
was carried out by bringing the vinyl sulfonate into<br>
contact with the strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin so<br>
that the metal removal rate is 95% or more, to thin-film<br>
distillation.<br>
[0104]<br>
Consequently, degradation of the compound during<br>
distillation is reduced, and a recovery rate can be<br>
further improved. Further, a generation of gases during<br>
distillation can be reduced, and a degree of vacuum can<br>
be stably maintained. In addition, continuous<br>
distillation becomes possible, and large-scale<br>
distillation can be carried out. Moreover, the residue<br>
can be obtained as a fluid product rather than a high-<br>
viscosity solid. Therefore, cleaning of the apparatus<br>
and equipment is easier. Still further, the obtained<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid has a high quality, and a basically<br>
colorless vinyl sulfonic acid can be obtained when it is<br>
distilled off. Moreover, a vinyl sulfonic acid which<br>
hardly changes in color over time can be obtained.<br>
[0105]<br>
The thin-film distillation can be carried out by a<br>
known method.<br>
[0106]<br>
The thin-film distillation conditions can be<br>
appropriately set. However, usually, the temperature is<br>
about 150 to 250°C, and preferably about 150 to 230°C.<br>
[0107]<br>
In addition, the pressure is usually about 10 to 400<br>
Pa, and preferably about 10 to 200 Pa.<br>
[0108]<br>
Under such conditions, degradation and<br>
polymerization can be further suppressed.<br>
[0109]<br>
The thin-film distillation can optionally be carried<br>
out twice or more, and can even be carried out<br>
continuously.<br>
[0110]<br>
A known thin-film distillation apparatus can be used.<br>
However, an apparatus in which all or a part of a contact<br>
with the vinyl sulfonic acid or a composition thereof is<br>
formed from a material having a high corrosion resistance<br>
is preferred.<br>
[0111]<br>
In addition, so that the distillation residue does<br>
not contaminate the product, the thin-film distillation<br>
apparatus preferably has a vinyl sulfonic acid vapor<br>
outlet which is provided in a middle section of the<br>
distillation tower, and a cooling device which is<br>
arranged externally to the distillation tower.<br>
[0112]<br>
Specific examples of the thin-film distillation<br>
apparatus include the apparatus described in the<br>
following section 3.<br>
[0113]<br>
The method for producing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
according to the present invention may optionally include<br>
further steps to those described above, such as a step of<br>
purifying the raw material.<br>
[0114]<br>
Further, known technology relating to the production<br>
of vinyl sulfonic acids may also be included as necessary.<br>
[0115]<br>
From the above-described production methods, a vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid can be obtained which has a high double<br>
bond content and a low metal content. In other words,<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acid used in the present invention<br>
includes the vinyl sulfonic acids which can be obtained<br>
by any of production methods 1 to 6. A vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid obtained by the above-described production methods<br>
has little discoloration and hardly any change in color<br>
over time.<br>
[0116]<br>
3. Apparatus<br>
The present invention provides a thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus which can be preferably used in<br>
the method for producing the vinyl sulfonic acid. In<br>
other words, the present invention provides a thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus for vinyl sulfonic acid production,<br>
or a thin-film distillation apparatus for vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid purification.<br>
[0117]<br>
In the thin-film distillation apparatus according to<br>
the present invention, all or a part of a contact with<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acid or a composition thereof is<br>
formed from a material having a high corrosion resistance.<br>
[0118]<br>
The term "a contact with the vinyl sulfonic acid or<br>
a composition thereof" (hereinafter also referred to as<br>
"vinyl sulfonic acid contact region") means, for example,<br>
a region that is in contact with the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
composition serving as the distillation raw material<br>
after it has undergone the metal removal treatment, the<br>
evaporated vinyl sulfonic acid vapor, or the condensed<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid formed from the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
vapor. These regions are also referred to as "liquid<br>
contact region" and/or "gas contact region".<br>
[0119]<br>
Examples of the members included in the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid contact region include a liquid feed pipe,<br>
the inner walls of the distillation tower, a stirring<br>
member, a wiper member, a cooling member, a stirring seal<br>
member, a distillation raw material introduction port, a<br>
distillate line, a receiver, a residue discharge line and<br>
the like.<br>
[0120]<br>
Examples of the material having a high corrosion<br>
resistance include JIS standard R-3503 borosilicate<br>
glass-1 and metal materials determined as being<br>
completely resistant to corrosion by a corrosion<br>
resistance test.<br>
[0121]<br>
JIS Standard R-3503 borosilicate glass-1 is a glass<br>
which, based on the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards)<br>
standard R-3503, has been given a rating of having a<br>
linear thermal expansion coefficient of 3.5xl0~6-K_1 or<br>
less and an alkali elution amount of 0.10 mL/g or less or<br>
31 ng/g or less.<br>
[0122]<br>
Further, the term "metal materials determined as<br>
being completely resistant to corrosion by a corrosion<br>
resistance test" refers to metal materials having a rate<br>
of corrosion of 0.05 mm/year or less. Examples of the<br>
corrosion resistance test include a method in which,<br>
based on the method of item a. in "Chemical Apparatus<br>
Handbook" (edited by the Society for Chemical Engineers,<br>
Japan, published by Maruzen, 1970, p. 500), a test piece<br>
is dipped in 165°C vinyl sulfonic acid and then the<br>
change in weight and the change in appearance after a<br>
certain time period are measured.<br>
[0123]<br>
Examples of the glass which is categorized as JIS<br>
Standard borosilicate glass-1 include products such as<br>
Pyrex (registered trademark), Hario (registered<br>
trademark), and Duran (registered trademark).<br>
[0124]<br>
Further, examples of the metal material determined<br>
as being completely resistant to corrosion include<br>
tantalum.<br>
[0125]<br>
If the vinyl sulfonic acid contact region is formed<br>
from the material having a high corrosion resistance,<br>
contamination of impurities from the material or the<br>
region can be suppressed. Conventionally, a material<br>
such as SUS was used as a metal for the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid contact region, so that impurities from this<br>
material contaminated the vinyl sulfonic acid. However,<br>
according to the above-described configuration, the level<br>
of contamination of impurities due to the material is<br>
reduced.<br>
[0126]<br>
An example in which tantalum is used as the material<br>
having a high corrosion resistance will now be described.<br>
[0127]<br>
The term "all or a part of the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
contact region is made from tantalum", or in other words,<br>
formed from tantalum, includes a case in which all or at<br>
least one of the members comprised the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid contact region is/are made from tantalum. Further,<br>
this also includes a case in which at least a part of one<br>
member constituting the vinyl sulfonic acid contact<br>
region is made from tantalum, specifically, is formed<br>
from tantalum.<br>
[0128]<br>
Further, the term "made from tantalum" means being<br>
formed from a material which essentially does not include<br>
components other than tantalum. In other words, the term<br>
"made from tantalum" means being formed from a material<br>
having a content of components other than tantalum of<br>
only less than 0.3 wt.%, and especially less than 300 ppm.<br>
[0129]<br>
Examples of the apparatus according to the present<br>
invention include an apparatus in which only the stirring<br>
rotation member and/or wiper member is made from tantalum,<br>
an apparatus in which the whole stirring rotation member<br>
is made from tantalum, an apparatus in which a part of<br>
the wiper member is made from tantalum, and an apparatus<br>
in which all or a part of the thin-film forming member is<br>
made from tantalum. It is especially preferred that the<br>
members or sections which conventionally are formed from<br>
a metal are made from tantalum.<br>
[0130]<br>
More specifically, for a falling thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus, an example thereof includes an<br>
apparatus in which all or a part of the stirring rotation<br>
member and wiper member is made from tantalum.<br>
Further, for a centrifugal thin-film distillation<br>
apparatus, an example thereof includes an apparatus in<br>
which the rotor member and the disk member are made from<br>
tantalum.<br>
[0131]<br>
An example of the apparatus is the following<br>
apparatus A, which comprises:<br>
an introduction port for the distillation raw<br>
material,<br>
a distillation tower for evaporating the introduced<br>
raw material,<br>
a stirring drive member arranged at the apex of the<br>
distillation tower,<br>
a stirring rotation member made from tantalum, which<br>
is arranged inside the distillation tower,<br>
a wiper member comprising at least a section made<br>
from tantalum, which is connected to the stirring<br>
rotation member,<br>
a vacuum pump suction port connected to the<br>
distillation tower,<br>
a cooling member arranged inside the distillation<br>
tower,<br>
a vinyl sulfonic acid receiver which receives the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid condensed by the cooling device, and<br>
a residue receiver arranged on the bottom of the<br>
distillation tower.<br>
[0132]<br>
For example, the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1<br>
is included in this example.<br>
[0133]<br>
Further, an example of another apparatus includes an<br>
apparatus configured so that the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
vapor exits from a middle section of the distillation<br>
tower, and is delivered to a cooling member provided<br>
externally to the distillation tower.<br>
[0134]<br>
Such an apparatus further suppresses contamination<br>
of the distillation residue in the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
vapor because the cooling member is provided externally<br>
to the distillation tower. Further, since the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid vapor is discharged from a middle section<br>
of the distillation tower, contamination of impurities<br>
due to corrosion and the like of the tower apex section<br>
of the stirring drive member and the like can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
[0135]<br>
The term "middle section" means, based on a length<br>
from the apex to the bottom of the distillation tower<br>
being 100, a position which is about 30 to 60, and<br>
preferably 40 to 50, the way down from the apex.<br>
[0136]<br>
An example of such an apparatus is the following<br>
apparatus B, which comprises:<br>
an introduction port for the distillation raw<br>
material,<br>
a distillation tower for evaporating the introduced<br>
raw material,<br>
a stirring drive member arranged at the apex of the<br>
distillation tower,<br>
a stirring rotation member made from tantalum, which<br>
is arranged inside the distillation tower,<br>
a wiper member comprising at least a section made<br>
from tantalum, which is connected to the stirring<br>
rotation member,<br>
a residue receiver arranged on the bottom of the<br>
distillation tower,<br>
a vinyl sulfonic acid outlet which is provided in a<br>
middle section of the distillation tower,<br>
a cooling device which is arranged externally to the<br>
distillation tower for condensing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
vapor from the outlet,<br>
a vinyl sulfonic acid receiver which receives the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid condensed by the cooling device, and<br>
a vacuum pump suction port connected to the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid receiver.<br>
[0137]<br>
For example, the apparatus illustrated in Figure 2<br>
is included in this example.<br>
[0138]<br>
The distillation tower usually has a heating means.<br>
Further, the distillation tower may optionally have a<br>
known means for sensing the temperature and the like.<br>
[0139]<br>
The stirring drive member is a power member for<br>
rotating the stirring rotation member. The stirring<br>
drive member is usually sealed by a stirring seal member<br>
to prevent corrosion due to vapor produced in the<br>
distillation tower.<br>
[0140]<br>
By carrying out purification using the above-<br>
described apparatuses, a vinyl sulfonic acid can be<br>
obtained which has a high double bond content and a low<br>
metal content. In other words, the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
used in the present invention includes a vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid obtained by carrying out purification using the<br>

Although SEC can be divided into gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC), in which the mobile phase is an<br>
organic solvent, and gel filtration chromatography (GFC),<br>
in which the mobile phase is an aqueous solution, the SEC<br>
in the present specification includes both of these<br>
methods.<br>
[0153]<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid homopolymer according to the<br>
present invention has a low impurity content, a low metal<br>
content, excellent quality, and can be preferably used as<br>
a raw material for an electric/electronic material. In<br>

[0158]<br>
5. Homopolymer production method<br>
A method for producing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
homopolymer is not especially limited. However,<br>
generally, the method is carried out by radical<br>
polymerization, photopolymerization, or radiation<br>
polymerization.<br>
[0159]<br>
The radical polymerization is carried out by adding<br>
a small amount of an initiator to the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
or an aqueous solution thereof. As the initiator, a<br>
peroxide, a persulfate, an azo compound or a redox<br>
initiator can be used.<br>
[0160]<br>

added dropwise to a solvent having a lower solubility for<br>
this polymer to cause a precipitate to form. The ion-<br>

The vinyl sulfonic acid copolymer according to the<br>
present invention can be obtained by copolymerizing the<br>
above-described vinyl sulfonic acid with one or two or<br>
more other monomers.<br>
[0166]<br>
These "other monomers" are polymerizable compounds<br>

the vinyl sulfonic acid with at least one kind selected<br>
from the group consisting of (meth)acrylic acid, a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid ester, a (meth)acrylic acid amide, and<br>

having:<br>
(i) a sodium (Na) content of 100 ppb or less,<br>
especially 50 ppb or less, and<br>
(ii) a content of at least one metal selected from<br>
the group consisting of alkali earth metal and first row<br>
transition metal of 100 ppb or less, and especially about<br>

especially 50 ppb or less.<br>
[0185]<br>
The reduction of the metal content in these monomers<br>
can be carried out by a known method, and is usually<br>
carried out by distillation or sublimation.<br>
[0186]<br>
During this process, to prevent polymerization of<br>

A method for producing the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
copolymer is not especially limited. However, generally,<br>
the method is carried out by radical polymerization,<br>
photopolymerization, or radiation polymerization.<br>

mixed.<br>
[0208]<br>
To further reduce the metal content, the copolymer<br>
according to the present invention may be purified by a<br>
known method. The purification method is not especially<br>
limited. Examples thereof include a solvent<br>
reprecipitation and an ion-exchange method.<br>
[0209]<br>
The solvent reprecipitation is a purification method<br>
in which a polymer is dissolved in as small an amount of<br>
solvent as possible, and then the resultant mixture is<br>
added dropwise to a solvent having a lower solubility for<br>
this polymer to cause a precipitate to form. The ion-<br>
exchange method is a purification method in which a<br>

and/or copolymer of the vinyl sulfonic acid according to<br>
the present invention as a material for a polymer<br>
electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell, a photoresist<br>
composition, and a conductive polymer composition.<br>
[0215]<br>
(1) Polymer electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell<br>
The polymer electrolyte membrane can be obtained by<br>
forming a film of the homopolymer and/or copolymer of the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present invention.<br>
[0216]<br>
The film-forming method is not especially limited.<br>
Examples of methods which can be used include forming the<br>
film from a solution state (solution casting) or forming<br>
the film from a melt state (melt pressing or melt<br>
extrusion). The film thickness is not especially limited,<br>
and can be appropriately set in order to obtain the<br>
desired characteristics. For solution casting, the film<br>
thickness can be controlled based on the solution<br>
concentration or based on the thickness of the coating on<br>
the substrate. For melt pressing or melt extrusion, the<br>
film thickness can be controlled based on the spacer<br>
thickness, the die gap, or the pick-up speed. In<br>
addition, during production of the polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane, additives which are usually used in polymers,<br>
such as a plasticizer, a stabilizing agent, and a release<br>
agent, may be used to the extent that does not hinder the<br>
object of the present invention.<br>
[0217]<br>
The obtained polymer electrolyte membrane can be<br>
preferably used for a fuel cell. The fuel cell<br>
production method is not especially limited. The fuel<br>
cell production can be carried out based on a known<br>
method, as long as such method uses a membrane using the<br>
polymer according to the present invention as the polymer<br>
electrolyte membrane. Further, the structure of the fuel<br>
cell is not especially limited, and a known structure can<br>
be used. Examples thereof include a structure formed<br>
from an oxygen electrode, a fuel electrode, an<br>
electrolyte membrane between the oxygen electrode and the<br>
fuel electrode, an oxidant distribution plate having an<br>

components, such as another water-soluble polymer or<br>
alkali-soluble polymer, a surfactant, a<br>
photopolymerizable crosslinking agent, a<br>
photopolymerization initiator, a sensitizer, and a photo-<br>
acid-generating agent.<br>
[0219]<br>
A ratio of the polymer can be appropriately set<br>
based on whether water or an organic solvent is used, the<br>
other component, and the lithography conditions.<br>
[0220]<br>
A photosensitive film pattern for a semiconductor<br>
device can be formed using the above-described<br>
photoresist composition to form a resist film.<br>
[0221]<br>
Although the resist film can also be formed by a<br>
common method, generally, the resist film is formed by<br>
coating the photoresist composition on a substrate, then<br>
solidifying the composition by heating, and volatilizing<br>
the solvent.<br>

[0226]<br>
The conductive polymer composition can be produced<br>
by ionic bonding of the vinyl sulfonic acid homopolymer<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0229]<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present<br>
invention has a high double bond content and a low metal<br>
content. According to the present invention, a vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid can be obtained which has little<br>
discoloration, hardly any change in color over time, and<br>
high quality.<br>
[0230]<br>
Further, the vinyl sulfonic acid homopolymer and<br>
copolymer according to the present invention obtained<br>
using this vinyl sulfonic acid for a monomer have almost<br>
no impurities, a low metal content, and excellent quality.<br>
[0231]<br>
Due to having such excellent properties, the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid, homopolymer, and copolymer according to<br>
the present invention have sufficient durability even in<br>
a harsh environment of a high temperature and strong<br>
oxidizing atmosphere. Therefore, the vinyl sulfonic acid,<br>
homopolymer, and copolymer according to the present<br>
invention can be preferably used for an<br>
electric/electronic material, such as for a fuel cell<br>
electrolyte membrane, a photoresist composition, and a<br>
conductive polymer, or as a raw material thereof.<br>
[0232]<br>
Further, the present invention provides a thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus suited to the production of a<br>
high-quality vinyl sulfonic acid. If purified using the<br>
apparatus according to the present invention, a vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid having a high double bond content and a low<br>
metal content can be obtained. In addition, according to<br>
the present invention, large-scale production of a high-<br>
quality vinyl sulfonic acid can be achieved by continuous<br>
operation of the thin-film distillation apparatus.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0236]<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples will now be<br>
illustrated to describe the present invention in more<br>
detail. However, the present invention is not limited to<br>
these.<br>
[0237]<br>
Materials and measurement methods<br>
Sodium vinyl sulfonate was used as the vinyl<br>
sulfonate serving as the raw material.<br>
[0238]<br>
Measurement of the metal content was carried out by<br>
quantifying the amount based on an internal standard<br>
method using an ICP mass spectrometry apparatus (model: X<br>
Series X7 ICP-MS, manufactured by Thermo Fischer<br>
Scientific Inc.), and subtracting an operation blank<br>
value which had been simultaneously quantified to<br>
determine the content.<br>
[0239]<br>
Acid value and iodine value measurement was carried<br>
out based on Japanese Industrial Standards JIS K0070-1992.<br>
The acid value was measured by neutralization titration.<br>
[0240]<br>
The double bond content was calculated from the<br>
following formula based on the measured iodine value.<br>
Double bond content (wt.%) = (iodine value) x (108.1/2) /<br>
126.9<br>
wherein 108.1 is the molecular weight of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid, and 126.9 is the atomic weight of iodine.<br>
The metal removal rate (sodium removal rate) was<br>
determined from the following formula based on the<br>
measured acid value.<br>
Metal removal rate (%) = {(acid value after metal removal<br>
treatment) / (acid value before metal removal treatment)}<br>
x 100.<br>
[0241]<br>
The production step yield was calculated from the<br>
following formula based on the measured iodine value.<br>
Yield (%) = {(iodine value after metal removal treatment)<br>
/ (iodine value before metal removal treatment)} x 100.<br>
[0242]<br>
The distillation recovery rate was calculated from<br>
the following formula based on the measured iodine value.<br>
Recovery rate (%) = {(iodine value after distillation) /<br>
(iodine value before distillation)} x 100.<br>
[0243]<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the copolymer<br>
was measured under the following condition A or condition<br>
B.<br>
[0244]<br>
Condition A: Measured by size-exclusion chromatography<br>
(SEC) using a 0.2 M aqueous solution of sodium nitrate<br>
for a solvent and polyethylene oxide as a standard sample.<br>
Three columns manufactured by Tosoh Corporation, SEC<br>
columns TSK-Gel ct-2500, cc-3000, and a-4000, connected<br>
together were used for the column.<br>
[0245]<br>
Condition B: Measured by size-exclusion chromatography<br>
(SEC) using a 0.1 wt.% solution of lithium bromide / N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide for a solvent and polystyrene oxide as<br>
a standard sample. Three columns manufactured by Showa<br>
Denko K.K., GPC columns KF-803, KF-804, and KF-805,<br>
connected together were used for the column.<br>
[0246]<br>
Light absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 248<br>
or 365 ran using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2450,<br>
manufactured by Shimadzu- Corporation) by placing a<br>
measurement sample in a quartz cell having an optical<br>
path length of 1 cm.<br>
[0247]<br>
Simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis (TG-DTA) was performed at a temperature range of<br>
30 to 450°C at a rate of temperature increase of<br>
10°C/minute under a nitrogen atmosphere using the TG 8120<br>
manufactured by Rigaku. Further, the point at which the<br>
weight had decreased by 10% from the start time in this<br>
measurement was taken as the 10% thermal decomposition<br>
temperature (Tdi0%) .<br>
[0248]<br>
In addition, unless stated otherwise, "%" in the<br>
respective examples represents "mole%" and "yield"<br>
indicates "molar yield".<br>

hydrochloric acid and batch distillation<br>
7.5 kg of a 25% aqueous solution of sodium vinyl<br>
sulfonate (N-SVS-25, manufactured by Asahi Kasei Fine<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was charged with 3 kg of 35%<br>
hydrochloric acid, and the resultant mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, under reduced<br>
pressure, about 4 L of water was evaporated. The<br>
precipitated salt was separated by filtration to perform<br>
a sodium removal treatment. This sodium removal<br>
treatment was carried out a further two times so that the<br>
sodiums in the sodium vinyl sulfonate were substituted<br>
with hydrogens, to thereby obtain an aqueous solution of<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid.<br>
[0250]<br>
The sodium removal rate determined based on the acid<br>
value before the sodium removal treatment and the acid<br>
value after the three sodium removal treatments was 93.5%.<br>
Further, the yield determined from the iodine value<br>
before the sodium removal treatment and the iodine value<br>
after the three sodium removal treatments was 94.8%.<br>
[0251]<br>
4.5 kg of the obtained aqueous solution of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid was subjected to distillation under reduced<br>
pressure in a 5 L glass flask to obtain 2.1 kg of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid. The recovery rate was 67%. The degree of<br>
vacuum was about 500 to 1,000 Pa. The fluctuations were<br>
large, and it was difficult to maintain the degree of<br>
vacuum. The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a double<br>
bond content of 98 wt.%, a Fe content of 750 ppb, a Na<br>
content of 5.7 ppm, a Ca content of 240 ppb, a Cr content<br>
of 330 ppb, and a Ni content of 220 ppb. Further, the<br>

precipitated salt was separated by filtration to perform<br>
a sodium removal treatment. This sodium removal<br>
treatment was carried out a further two times so that the<br>
sodiums in the sodium vinyl sulfonate were substituted<br>
with hydrogens, to thereby obtain an aqueous solution of<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid.<br>
[0279]<br>
The sodium removal rate determined based on the acid<br>
value before the sodium removal treatment and the acid<br>
value after the three sodium removal treatments was 93.5%.<br>
Further, the yield determined from the iodine value<br>
before the sodium removal treatment and the iodine value<br>
after the three sodium removal treatments was 94.8%.<br>
[0280]<br>
4.5 kg of the obtained aqueous solution of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid was subjected to distillation under reduced<br>
pressure in a 5 L glass flask to obtain 2.1 kg of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid. The recovery rate was 67%. The degree of<br>
vacuum was about 500 to 1,000 Pa. The fluctuations were<br>
large, and it was difficult to maintain the degree of<br>
vacuum. The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a double<br>
bond content of 98 wt.%, a Fe content of 750 ppb, a Na<br>
content of 5.7 ppm, a Ca content of 240 ppb, a Cr content<br>
of 330 ppb, and a Ni content of 220 ppb. Further, the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid had a strong dark purple color from<br>
the time of extraction. In addition, a black residue<br>
lacking any fluidity was produced.<br>

Comparative Example II-2: Sodium removal treatment using<br>
strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin and batch<br>
concentration<br>
A column tower having an internal diameter of 200 mm<br>
and a height of 900 mm was filled with 26 L of a<br>
strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin (DOWEX (registered<br>
trademark) Monosphere 650C) which had been regenerated<br>
with hydrochloric acid in advance. A sodium removal<br>

[0282]<br>
0.6 kg of dilute vinyl sulfonic acid composition<br>

this sodium removal treatment was concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
[0284]<br>
4.2 kg of the obtained vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
composition was continuously fed into a thin-film<br>
distillation apparatus to try and carry out continuous<br>
distillation under reduced pressure. The temperature<br>
conditions were 160 to 200°C. Consequently, the degree<br>
of vacuum was maintained at 70 Pa, and the distillation<br>
operation could be stably continued. Further, there was<br>
no odor of sulfurous acid gas, and the recovery rate was<br>
maintained at about 94%.<br>
[0285]<br>
The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a double bond<br>
content of 97.5 wt.!, a Fe content of 455 ppb, a Na<br>

content of 120 ppb. The vinyl sulfonic acid had a pale<br>
yellow color when extracted, and no progression in color<br>
was seen even after 6 months had passed. Further,<br>
although a residue was produced during distillation, this<br>
residue had fluidity and a blackish brown color, and was<br>
easily cleaned.<br>

Using the thin-film distillation apparatus<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, 3.6 kg of the obtained vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid composition was continuously fed into the<br>
apparatus to try and carry out continuous distillation<br>
under reduced pressure. The temperature conditions were<br>
160 to 200°C. Consequently, the degree of vacuum was<br>
maintained at 70 Pa, and the distillation operation could<br>
be stably continued. Further, there was no odor of<br>
sulfurous acid gas, and the recovery rate was maintained<br>
at about 96%.<br>
[0288]<br>
The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a high purity<br>
with a double bond content of 97 wt.%, a Fe content of 24<br>
ppb, a Na content of 25 ppb, a Ca content of 30 ppb, a Cr<br>
content of 5 ppb, and a Ni content of 4 ppb. The vinyl<br>

[0289]<br>
Further, concerning tantalum, a corrosion test was<br>
carried out by dipping the test piece in 165°C vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid based on the method described in Chemical<br>

190 to 200°C. Consequently, the degree of vacuum was<br>

operation could be stably continued. Further, there was<br>
no odor of sulfurous acid gas, and the recovery rate was<br>
maintained at about 14%.<br>
[0295]<br>
The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a high purity,<br>
with a double bond content of 97 wt.%, and had a pale<br>
yellow color when extracted.<br>
[0296]<br>
The residue produced during this distillation was<br>
subjected to continuous distillation under reduced<br>
pressure using a thin-film distillation apparatus under<br>
the same conditions as described above. Consequently, a<br>
recovery rate of about 17% was obtained. Further, the<br>
obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a high purity with a<br>
double bond content of 98 wt.%, and had a pale yellow<br>
color when extracted.<br>
[0297]<br>
The residue produced during this distillation was<br>

was repeated in the same manner 5 times.<br>

[0299]<br>
Test Example 1<br>
The measurement results of the light absorbance of<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acids obtained in Example 1-2 and<br>
Example II-2 at 248 nm and 365 run are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0300]<br>
[0301]<br>
As shown in Table 1, the vinyl sulfonic acids<br>
obtained in Example 1-2 and Example II-2 both had a small<br>
light absorbance. Especially, it can be seen that the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid obtained in Example II-2 had a<br>
smaller light absorbance, specifically, a larger<br>
transmittance.<br>
[0302]<br>
Based on these results, it is predicted that if this<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid having a lower metal content is used<br>
in a photoresist composition, the light transmittance<br>
during exposure would be high, and that a resist pattern<br>
of a photoresist film formed after developing could be<br>
formed with a stable line width.<br>
[0303]<br>
Example II-4: Sodium removal treatment using strongly-<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin and thin-film distillation<br>
A column tower having an internal diameter of 200 mm<br>
and a height of 900 mm was filled with 26 L of a<br>
strongly-acidic ion-exchange resin (DOWEX (registered<br>
trademark) Monosphere 650C) which had been regenerated<br>
with hydrochloric acid in advance. A sodium removal<br>
treatment was carried out by flowing 12.2 kg of a 25 wt.%<br>

manufactured by Asahi Kasei Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.) in<br>
from the bottom of the column, and then washing from the<br>
bottom of the column with 100 kg of ion-exchanged water.<br>
The sodium removal rate determined based on the acid<br>
value before and after the one-time sodium removal<br>
treatment was 99%. Further, the yield was 88.4%. 300 kg<br>
of dilute vinyl sulfonic acid composition obtained by<br>
this sodium removal treatment was concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
[0304]<br>
Using the thin-film distillation apparatus<br>
illustrated in Figure 2, 15.4 kg of the obtained vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid composition was continuously fed into the<br>
apparatus to try and carry out continuous distillation<br>
under reduced pressure. The temperature conditions were<br>
185 to 200°C. Consequently, the degree of vacuum was<br>
maintained at 100 to 150 Pa, and the distillation<br>
operation could be stably continued. Further, there was<br>
no odor of sulfurous acid gas, and the recovery rate was<br>
maintained at about 80%.<br>
[0305]<br>
The obtained vinyl sulfonic acid had a high purity<br>
with a double bond content of 98.1 wt.%, a Fe content of<br>
1.5 ppb, a Na content of 10 ppb, a Ca content of less<br>
than 20 ppb, a Cr content of less than 1 ppb. The vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid had a pale yellow color when extracted, and<br>

passed. Further, although a residue was produced during<br>
distillation, this residue had fluidity and a blackish<br>
brown color, and was easily cleaned.<br>
[0306]<br>
Example II-5: Polymerization of vinyl sulfonic acid by<br>
UV-ray irradiation<br>
In a 20 mL sample bottle, 2 g of the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid obtained in Example II-2 and 1 g (0.74 moles based<br>
on 1 mole of the vinyl sulfonic acid) of N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide (reagent grade, manufactured by<br>
Katayama Chemical Ltd.) were mixed. The resultant<br>
mixture was then irradiated with 360 nm UV-rays using a<br>
UV irradiation apparatus. After performing<br>
polymerization for 1 hour at a polymerization temperature<br>
of 35 to 45°C, a transparent resin-like solid was formed<br>
in the system.<br>
[0307]<br>
The obtained polymer product was dissolved in ion-<br>
exchanged water, and then the resultant aqueous solution<br>
was added dropwise to a 20-fold weight of tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The resultant precipitate was filtrated and dissolved in<br>
ion-exchanged water. Then, the resultant aqueous<br>
solution was again added dropwise to a 20-fold weight of<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The produced precipitate was filtrated,<br>
and heated and dried under vacuum for one day and night<br>
at 50°C to obtain a polymer.<br>
[0308]<br>
The obtained polymer was a transparent solid with a<br>
pale yellow color. When measured by SEC (condition A),<br>
the polymer product had a weight average molecular weight<br>
of 5.0x10".<br>
[0309]<br>
Example II-6: Radical polymerization of vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid<br>
In a polymerization tube, 10 g of the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid obtained in Example II-2 and 10 g of ion-exchanged<br>
water were mixed. The resultant mixture was charged with<br>
0.2 g of azobisisobutyronitrile. The mixture was charged<br>
into a thoroughly evacuated sealed tube, and polymerized<br>
in a dark location at 60°C.<br>
[0310]<br>
The obtained polymer product was dissolved in ion-<br>
exchanged water, and then the resultant aqueous solution<br>
was added dropwise to a 20-fold weight of tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The resultant precipitate was filtrated and dissolved in<br>
ion-exchanged water. Then, the resultant aqueous<br>
solution was again added dropwise to a 20-fold weight of<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The produced precipitate was filtrated,<br>
and heated and dried under vacuum for one day and night<br>
at 50°C to obtain a polymer.<br>
[0311]<br>
The obtained polymer was a transparent solid with a<br>
pale yellow color. When measured by SEC (condition A),<br>
the polymer product had a weight average molecular weight<br>
of 3.3x10".<br>
[0312]<br>
Comparative Example II-4: Sodium polyvinyl sulfonate<br>
The molecular weight of sodium polyvinyl sulfonate<br>
(manufactured by Aldrich) was measured. Also, the<br>
thermal property of this sodium polyvinyl sulfonate was<br>
evaluated. When measured by SEC (condition A), the<br>
sodium polyvinyl sulfonate had a weight average molecular<br>
weight of 9.0xl04.<br>
[0313]<br>
Test Example 2<br>
The measurement results of simultaneous<br>
thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA)<br>
for the polymers obtained in Examples 1-7 and II-5 and<br>
the polymer of Comparative Example I1-4 are shown in<br>
Table 2. In Table 2, Tdio% represents the 10% thermal<br>
decomposition temperature.<br>
[0315]<br>
As shown in Table 2, it can be seen that the<br>
polymers obtained using the vinyl sulfonic acid according<br>
to the present invention had a Td10% of 150°C or more.<br>
[0316]<br>
Since the sodium polyvinyl sulfonate of Comparative<br>
Example II-4 was in the form of a sodium salt of a<br>
sulfonic acid group, it can be understood that it had<br>
excellent thermal stability. However, since sodium<br>
polyvinyl sulfonate is a metal salt, it is soluble in<br>
water, and thus ionizes in the presence of water.<br>
Therefore, such a sodium polyvinyl sulfonate is not<br>
suitable for a fuel cell membrane.<br>
[0317]<br>
Vinyl sulfonic acid has a structure which is formed<br>
only from a vinyl group and a sulfonic acid group.<br>
Therefore, a polymer formed from sulfonic acid as a<br>
monomer has a much higher density of sulfonic acid groups<br>
than a polymer formed using another sulfonic-acid-group-<br>
containing vinyl monomer.<br>
[0318]<br>
Further, a polymer obtained using the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid according to the present invention has a low level<br>
of impurities, and a low metal content, so that the<br>
sulfonic acid group density is increased.<br>
[0319]<br>
In addition, as shown by the results in Table 2, the<br>
polymer obtained using the vinyl sulfonic acid according<br>
to the present invention also had excellent thermal<br>
stability. Therefore, it is predicted that this polymer<br>
would be sufficiently stable from room temperature to<br>
about 120°C, which is the typical operation temperature<br>
of a solid polymer fuel cell.<br>
[0320]<br>
Moreover, the polymer according to the present<br>
invention can be obtained using a vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
having a low metal content. Therefore, it is predicted<br>
that the metal content can be decreased, and the<br>
oxidation resistance of the polymer electrolyte membrane<br>
can be improved.<br>
[0321]<br>
Consequently, it is considered that the polyvinyl<br>
sulfonic acid polymer according to the present invention<br>
can be used as an excellent material for an excellent<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell.<br>
[0322]<br>
Test Example 3: PEDOT/PVS chemical oxidation<br>
polymerization and electrical conductivity thereof<br>
In an aqueous solution of polyvinyl sulfonic acid<br>
(hereinafter, "PVS")/ 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene was<br>
subjected to chemical oxidation polymerization to produce<br>
a conductive polymer composition PEDOT/PVS comprised<br>
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (hereinafter, "PEDOT")<br>
and polyvinyl sulfonic acid (PVS).<br>
[0323]<br>
A 100 mL pear-shaped flask was charged with 0.135 g<br>
of the vinyl sulfonic acid of Example II-5, 50 mL of ion-<br>
exchanged water, and 0.71 g of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,<br>
and the resultant mixture was stirred for 1 hour.<br>
[0324]<br>
The mixture was charged with 1.14 g of ammonium<br>
persulfate. Then, the flask was thoroughly purged with<br>
nitrogen, and the mixture was polymerized at room<br>
temperature for 12 hours. After the polymerization<br>
reaction finished, the product underwent dialysis for 3<br>
days with ion-exchanged water using a dialysis membrane<br>
having a molecular weight cutoff of 3,500 (Spectra/Por<br>
(registered trademark), manufactured by Spectrum) to<br>
remove the low molecular weight component.<br>
[0325]<br>
The obtained PEDOT/PVS dispersion was cast onto a<br>
Teflon (registered trademark) substrate, and then heated<br>
and dried at 40°C for one night. The electrical<br>
conductivity was measured at room temperature using a<br>
four-point probe tester (K-705RS, Kyowariken Co., Ltd.).<br>
[0326]<br>
For comparison, the electrical conductivity of<br>
PEDOT/PSS (polystyrene sulfonic acid) (manufactured by<br>
Aldrich) was measured in the same manner. These results<br>
are shown in Table 3.<br>
[0328]<br>
As shown in Table 3, the PEDOT/PVS exhibited a<br>
higher electrical conductivity than the electrical<br>
conductivity of the PEDOT/PSS.<br>
[0329]<br>
It is thought that PEDOT disperses in the water and<br>
PSS is a dopant, and PVS also functioning as a dopant<br>
similar to PSS.<br>
[0330]<br>
Further, structurally, since PSS has an aromatic<br>
ring, it has a high glass transition point, and poor<br>
contact properties with the substrate. On the other hand,<br>
since PVS does not have an aromatic ring, PVS is expected<br>
to have a low glass transition point, and excellent<br>
contact properties with the substrate.<br>
[0331]<br>
More specifically, it is thought that PVS can be<br>
used as a better conductive polymer dopant than PSS.<br>
[0332]<br>
Example III-l: Copolymerization of vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
and methyl methacrylate by UV irradiation<br>
A 4.5 mL quartz cell was charged with 0.5 g of the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid obtained in Example 1-1, 0.5 g of<br>
methyl methacrylate, and 0.5 g of N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
and the resultant mixture was uniformly mixed. The<br>
methyl methacrylate was produced by charging methyl<br>
methacrylate (reagent, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) into a four-neck flask made from Pyrex<br>
(registered trademark) glass, adding 0.1 wt.%<br>
hydroquinone monomethyl ether based on the methyl<br>
methacrylate, and carrying out distillation under reduced<br>
pressure to purify the product.<br>
[0333]<br>
The obtained mixture was irradiated with UV-rays for<br>
20 minutes. Subsequently, this reaction solution was<br>
added dropwise to a large amount methanol, and a white<br>
solid product was separated. The obtained white solid<br>
product was heated and dried under vacuum for one day and<br>
night at 50°C to obtain a polymer. The obtained polymer<br>
was a white transparent solid. When measured by SEC<br>
(condition B), the polymer product had a weight average<br>
molecular weight of 1.1x10s.<br>
[0334]<br>
Example III-2: Copolymerization of vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
and methyl methacrylate by UV irradiation<br>
A copolymer was obtained by carrying out<br>
polymerization in the same manner as in Example III-l,<br>
except that the weights of the vinyl sulfonic acid and<br>
the methyl methacrylate were changed to the values shown<br>
in Table 4.<br>
[0335]<br>
Example III-3: Copolymerization of vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
and methyl methacrylate by UV irradiation<br>
A copolymer was obtained by carrying out<br>
polymerization in the same manner as in Example III-l,<br>
except that the weights of the vinyl sulfonic acid and<br>
the methyl methacrylate were changed to the values shown<br>
in Table 4.<br>
[0336]<br>
Table 4 shows the weight and mole% of the monomers<br>
used in Examples III-l to III-3, and the weight average<br>
molecular weights of the obtained copolymers. In the<br>
below, the term "mole%" represents a ratio of a number of<br>
moles of each monomer when a number of moles of all the<br>
monomers constituting the copolymer is 100, based on the<br>
number of moles calculated from the weight (g) of the<br>
monomers.<br>

A 50 mL pear-shaped flask was charged with 1.73 g of<br>
the vinyl sulfonic acid obtained Example 1-1, 0.29 g of<br>
acrylic acid (reagent, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.), 44 mg of ammonium persulfate as an<br>
initiator, and 4 mL of ion-exchanged water as a reaction<br>
solvent. Here, the 44 mg of ammonium persulfate was<br>
equivalent to 1 mole% based on the total number of moles<br>
of the vinyl sulfonic acid and the acrylic acid.<br>
[0339]<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid, the acrylic acid and<br>
ammonium persulfate were dissolved. Then, the flask was<br>
thoroughly purged with nitrogen, and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 16 hours at 60°C. After cooling to room<br>
temperature, 15 mL of methanol was added. The mixture<br>
was then filtrated and washed to remove the residual<br>
initiator.<br>
[0340]<br>
The methanol filtrate was concentrated, then added<br>
dropwise to a large amount of tetrahydrofuran, whereby a<br>
white solid product was separated. The obtained white<br>
solid product was heated and dried under vacuum for two<br>
days at 60°C to obtain a polymer.<br>
[0341]<br>
The obtained polymer was soluble in water, methanol,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and the like. Further, when<br>
measured by SEC (condition B), the obtained polymer had a<br>
weight average molecular weight of 8xl04.<br>

The resultant mixture was uniformly mixed, and then<br>
subjected to UV irradiation for 20 minutes to obtain a<br>

and heated and dried under vacuum for one day and night<br>
at 50°C to obtain a polymer.<br>
[0354]<br>

to the values shown in Table 7.<br>

used in Examples 111-10 to 111-12, and the weight average<br>

[0359]<br>
As shown in Tables 4 to 7, it can be seen that the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid copolymers having a sufficient weight<br>
average molecular weight were obtained using the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid according to the present invention.<br>
[0360]<br>
Example 111-13: Copolymerization of vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
and acrylonitrile by UV irradiation<br>
'A 10 mm quartz cell was charged with 0.9 g of the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid obtained in Example 1-5, 1.0 g of<br>
acrylonitrile, and 0.45 g of N,N-dimethylformamide, and<br>
the resultant mixture was uniformly mixed. The mixture<br>
was then irradiated with UV-rays for 40 minutes to obtain<br>
a polymer product. The acrylonitrile was produced by<br>
charging acrylonitrile (reagent, manufactured by Tokyo<br>
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) into a four-neck flask made<br>
from Pyrex (registered trademark) glass, and carrying out<br>
distillation under reduced pressure to purify the product.<br>
The N,N-dimethylformamide was produced by charging N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide (reagent, manufactured by Wako Pure<br>
Chemical Industries, Ltd.) into a four-neck flask made<br>
from Pyrex (registered trademark) glass, and carrying out<br>
distillation under reduced pressure to purify the product.<br>

0.2 8 g of a polymer.<br>
[0362]<br>
When measured by SEC (condition B), the obtained<br>
polymer product had a weight average molecular weight of<br>
3.2xl06. Further, the ratio of the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
units in the polymer was measured by subjecting the<br>
polymer to ion-exchange with sodium chloride and then<br>
titrating with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The measurement<br>
value was 12.8 wt.%.<br>
[0363]<br>
From the results of Example 111-13, it was found<br>
that the acrylonitrile copolymer obtained using the vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid having a high purity and a low metal<br>
content was a polymer which comprised a large amount of<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid units and which had a high molecular<br>
weight.<br>
[0364]<br>
The polymer comprised a large amount of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid units, therefore it is thought that a<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane having excellent proton<br>
conductivity can be obtained by use of the polymer.<br>
[0365]<br>
Further, it is thought that a vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
copolymer having a high molecular weight has good film-<br>
forming properties and can be used to produce a strong<br>
membrane.<br>

using the vinyl sulfonic acid according to the present<br>

[0396]<br>
The obtained polymer product was dissolved in N,N-<br>

added dropwise to a 20-fold weight of isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The resultant precipitate was filtrated, and washed with<br>

g of a polymer.<br>
[0397]<br>
When measured by SEC (condition B), the obtained<br>

3.8xl06. Further, the ratio of the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
units in the polymer was measured by subjecting the<br>
polymer to ion-exchange with sodium chloride and then<br>
titrating with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The measurement<br>
value was 13.8 wt.%.<br>
[0398]<br>
From the results of Example IV-13, it was found that<br>
the acrylonitrile copolymer product obtained using the<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid having a high purity and a low metal<br>
content was a polymer which comprised a large amount of<br>
vinyl sulfonic acid units and which had a high molecular<br>
weight.<br>
[0399]<br>
The polymer comprised a large amount of vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid units, therefore it is thought that a<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane having excellent proton<br>
conductivity can be obtained by use of the polymer.<br>
[0400]<br>
Further, it is thought that a vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
copolymer having a high molecular weight has good film-<br>
forming properties and can be used to produce a strong<br>

[0401]<br>
Test Example 4<br>
Using the vinyl sulfonic acid obtained in Example<br>
II-2, a Q value and an e value were determined.<br>
[0402]<br>
Here, the Q value and the e value are constants<br>
represented by the Alfrey-Price formula. These values<br>
can be obtained by hypothesizing that a rate constant ki2<br>
of the following growth reaction,<br>
Mr + M2 ~* M2-<br>
is represented as follows.<br>
[0403]<br>
k12 = PiQ2exp (-eie2)<br>
[0404]<br>
[0405]<br>
In the formula, Pi represents the level of general<br>
reactivity (resonance stabilization) of Mi-, Q2 represents<br>
the level of resonance stabilization of M2, ei and e2<br>
represent the polar effects of Mi-, and M2, respectively.<br>
[0406]<br>
Styrene was selected as a standard. The Q value of<br>
styrene is 1.0, and the e value is -0.8.<br>
[0407]<br>
A copolymer of the vinyl sulfonic acid obtained in<br>
Example II-2 and styrene was produced. The Q value of<br>
the obtained vinyl sulfonic acid was 0.09 and the e value<br>
was 1.3.<br>
[0408]<br>
The vinyl sulfonic acid of Non-Patent Document 2<br>
(ethylene sulfonic acid) is described as having a Q value<br>
of 0.09 and an e value of 1.3.<br>
[0409]<br>
Using those values, based on the following formula,<br>
the reactivity ratios ri and r2 with the various<br>
copolymer monomers were determined.<br>
[Formula 3]<br>
<br>
[0410]<br>
In the formula, Qi and ei represent the Q value and<br>
the e value of the vinyl sulfonic acid serving as Mi.<br>
Further, Q2 and e2 represent the Q value and the e value<br>
of the various copolymer monomers serving as M2. The<br>
values shown in the following tables, which are taken<br>
from Polymer Handbook, Fourth Edition (published by John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., p. 11-318-319), were used for the Q<br>
value and the e value of the copolymer monomers.<br>
[0412]<br>
The Q value and the e value of the vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid according to the present invention and that<br>
described in Non-Patent Document 2 are shown in Table 13.<br>
Further, the obtained reactivity ratios ri and r2 are<br>
also shown in Table 13.<br>
[0413]<br>
[0414]<br>
The results show that when the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
according to the present invention was used, ri increased<br>
by a factor of 1.9 to 2.7, so that it can be presumed<br>
that a large amount of vinyl sulfonic acid was<br>
incorporated in the copolymer.<br>
[0415]<br>
Consequently, this suggests that copolymer<br>
efficiency with various vinyl monomers can be<br>
dramatically improved by using the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
according to the present invention. It is thus<br>
considered that a copolymer having an increased vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid content can be obtained.<br>
[0416]<br>
If the vinyl sulfonic acid content increases, it is<br>
believed that the sulfonic acid group content in the<br>
polymer also increases, and that proton conductivity<br>
improves. Therefore, it is considered that the copolymer<br>
according to the present invention can serve as an<br>
excellent polymer electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell.<br>
[0417]<br>
In addition, by obtaining the vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
polymer according to the present invention using a vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid having a low metal content, the metal<br>
content is also decreased. Therefore, it is considered<br>
that the oxidation resistance of the polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane is also improved.<br>
