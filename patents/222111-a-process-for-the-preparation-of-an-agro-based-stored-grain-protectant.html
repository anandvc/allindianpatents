				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an agro-based stored grain protectant, in particular, the agro-based protectant used is potato peel.<br>
Many plants manufacture chemicals that protect them against insect attack and the extract from these plants affect the response in insect species other than those attacking the plant from which the chemical was derived. Use of plants and or their extracts for pest infestation control in stored grains therefore seems to offer desirable solutions.<br>
Reference may be made to Bodnaryk RP, Fields PG, Xie Y and Fulcher KA, US Patent No. 5,955,082 (1999) wherein the authors have described a protein-rich field pea composition effective in controlling insect pests. The drawback is that a protein-rich fraction had to be isolated from the legume involving several steps to obtain the extract which possesses toxicity to insects.<br>
Reference may be made to Fields PG, Xie YS and Hou X, J.Stored Products Res., 37(2001) 359-370, wherein the authors have investigated the repellent effect of pea fractions against stored product insects. The drawback is that the pea fractions were not reported to affect the multiplication of the insects.<br>
Reference may be made to Belmain SR, Neal GE, Ray DE and Golub P, Food Chem. Toxicol. 39 (2001) 287-291, wherein the authors have screened six plant species used in Ghana to control insect pests of stored grain and legumes. The drawback is that some of the plant materials were found to be toxic to vertebrates.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Rajapakse D and Van Emden HF, J.Stored Product Res., 33 (1997), 59-68, wherein the potential of four vegetable oils and ten botanical powders in managing the bruchid beetles of legumes is documented. The drawbacks are that the plant powders were used at high concentrations.<br>
Reference may be made to Pereira J, J.Stored Product Res., 19 (1983) 57-62, wherein the author has assessed the effectiveness of six vegetable oils against pulse beetles. The drawback is that the oils apart from being expensive also turn rancid and may impart an off-flavour the grains.<br>
A significant relationship has been reported between grain damage and total phenolic content. Phenolics are known to be directly involved in insect resistance in many plants by antixenoxis (effect on oviposition) and antibiosis (effect on F1 generation). Potato peel is rich in polyphenols and in potato tuber, the peel offers resistance against insect attack.<br>
The present invention provides a safe, economical alternative for the storage of grains relatively free of insect pests without the use of synthetic chemical insecticides. The process employs a plant-based, agro-waste, which is absolutely risk-free, non-residual and non-toxic on consumption.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an agro-based stored grain protectant, which obviates the drawbacks as stated above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of an agro-based stored grain protectant, which comprises: a) washing the potato peel may be effected with water,<br><br>
b)	drying the washed peel may be effected in a conventional oven at a<br>
temperature ranging between 60 and 70°C for a period in the range of 5 to 6<br>
hours,<br>
c)	pulverizing the above said dried peel may be effected by a mechanical device<br>
to obtain a powder of mesh size ranging between 50 and 100 microns,<br>
d)	extracting the pulverized peel powder may be effected with distilled water in<br>
the range of 1 to 15% (w/v) for a period ranging from 5 to 10 min to obtain peel<br>
extract,<br>
e)	filtering the above said peel extract may be effected by using Whatman No.1<br>
filter paper to obtain a filtrate,<br>
f)	lyophilizing the above said filtrate may be effected under vacuum for a period<br>
in the range of 4 to 6 hours and<br>
g)	dissolving the lyophilized powder may be effected in 30-60% ethyl alcohol<br>
solvent at a ratio ranging from 0.1:10 to 1.5:10 to obtain the desired product.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used in step 1g imay be preferably 50% ethyl alcohol.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is that for the first time, a waste byproduct, potato peel has been employed to prepare a product for the control of stored grain insects. All the materials used in the preparation are food materials, which in effect is that food materials are used to protect stored grains from insect infestation.<br><br>
A general process for the preparation of the novel stored grain protectant is given in the flow chart:<br>
Raw potato peel<br>
I<br>
Washed with water<br>
I<br>
Oven dried at 60-70° C for 5-6 hours<br>
I<br>
Dried peel pulverized to a powder, mesh size 50-100<br>
I<br>
Peel powder homogenized with distilled water for 5-10 minutes<br>
I<br>
Peel powder extract filtered<br>
I<br>
Filtrate lyophilized to dryness<br>
I<br>
Lyophilized powder dissolved in 50% ethyl alcohol<br>
I<br>
Grain protectant preparation<br>
The    total    polyphenol    content    in    the    extract    was    determined    by Spectrophotometry.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present ;nvention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Five kg of fresh potato peels were washed under tap water to remove all adhering soil and other debris. The washed peels were then oven dried at 65 ° C for 6 hours. The dried peels were powdered using a grinder and then sieved to obtain a particle size of 80 mesh. 1, 3 and 5 g of the peel powder was taken in 100ml of distilled water separately and homogenized for 5 min. The homogenate was then filtered using a Whatman No. 1 filter paper to obtain the water extract of the peel. The extracts were lyophilized to dryness and each dissolved in 10 ml of 50% ethyl alcohol.<br>
Potato peel powder extract as prepared above was mixed with 20g wheat at 1, 3 and 5% and the grains air dried in petriplates (moisture content 12%). The grains were transferred to 150X23mm glass tubes. Ten adult (unsexed) Sitophilus oryzae (1-2 weeks old) were released into each tube and the tubes covered with muslin cloth held by rubber bands. Two sets of four replicates were included in each treatment. The number of insects dead in each replicate were noted on day 21 after which both live and the dead insects were discarded. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for emergence of the progency (F1 generation). 50 grains of each treatment from one set were taken, placed in warm water (50-60°C) for 10 mins and then removed and soaked in Acid Fuchsin solution (0.5%solution) for 3 mins and drained on a filter paper. The numbers of eggs laid per grain (in<br><br>
terms of the mucilage plug) were counted under a stereomicroscope. The results<br>
of the various parameters are given in Table 1.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Five kg of fresh potato peels were washed under tap water to remove all adhering soil and other debris. The washed peels were then dried an oven at 65 ° C for 5 hours. The dried peels were powdered using a grinder and then sieved to obtain a particle size of 80 mesh. 5, 10 and 15 g of the peel powder was taken in 100ml of distilled water separately and homogenized for Smins. The homogenate was then filtered using a Whatman No.1 filter paper to obtain the water extract of the peel. The extracts were lyophilized to dryness and each dissolved in 10 ml of 50% ethyl alcohol.<br>
Potato peel powder extract prepared as above was mixed with 20 g green gram at 5, 10 and 15% and the grains air dried in petri plates (moisture content 12%). The grains were transferred to 150X23mm glass tubes. Twenty adult (unsexed) Callosobruchus chinensis (1-2 days old) were released into each tube<br><br>
and the tubes covered with muslin cloth held by rubber bands. Four replicates were included in each treatment. The number of insects dead in each replicate were noted on day 14 after which both live and the dead insects were discarded. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for emergence of the progency (F1 generation). 50 grains were taken from each treatment and the grains observed individually under a stereomicroscope for enumerating the number of eggs per grain and then replaced into their respective tubes. The results of the various parameters are given in Table 2.<br>
