High levels of free fatty acids (FFA) lead to an increase of liver mitochondrial P-oxidation, which is crucial to drive efficient gluconeogenesis. The mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain FFA requires the intervention of two membrane-bound carnitine-dependent palmitoyltransferases (CPTs). CPT1, the outer mitochondrial membrane enzyme, catalyzes the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines. Liver (L-CPT1) and muscle (M-CPT1) CPT1 isoforms are encoded by two different genes and inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The N-ter domain of L-CPTl confers its lower sensitivity to malonyl CoA. CPT2, the inner mitochondrial membrane enzyme, reconverts long-chain acylcarnitines into long-chain acyl CoA esters. Long-chain acyl-CoAs are then 0-oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which activates the pyruvate carboxylase and gluconeogenesis.<br>
According to the mechanism of action described above, pharmaceutically active substances which inhibit L-CPT1 reduce liver (3-oxidation, consequently inhibit gluconeogenesis and therefore counteract hyperglycemia.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit liver carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (L-CPT1) activity. The compounds of the present invention can be used as pharmaceutically active agents which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases which are modulated by L-CPT1 inhibitors, particularly diseases which are related to hyperglycemia and/or glucose tolerance disorders. Such diseases include e.g. diabetes and associated pathologies, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (also referred to as diabetes type II), obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure and renal failure<br>

Human liver and muscle CPT1 cDNAs and rat CPT2 cDNA were subcloned in pGAPZB or pGAPZA, respectively. These plasmids were used to transform P. pastoris strain X-33 via electroporation after the preparation of electrocompetent cells. High copy number clones were selected where necessary using 0.5 or 1 mg/ml Zeocin. Cultures for activity measurements were induced for 16 h in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). Crude cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells with glass beads or French Press, depending on fermenter sizes. After centrifugation, the cell-free extracts were resuspended in cell breaking buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.4, 100 mM KC1, ImM EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail, before aliquoting and freezing at -20°C.<br>
CPT activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay using 5,5'-dithio-Z&gt;/s-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) also called Ellman's reagent. The HS-CoA released on the formation of acylcarnitine from carnitine (500 |JM) and palmitoyl-CoA (80 |JM) reduced DTNB (300 |JM) forming 5-mercapto-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) wich absorbed at 410 nm with a molar coefficient extinction of 13600 M'^cm"1. The assay buffer contained 120 mM KC1, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA. This assay was used for the identification of selective inhibitors of the liver CPT1 isoform versus the muscle CPT1 and CPT2 isoforms.<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) preferably have an IC50 value below 10 µM, preferably 10 nM to 10 µM, more preferably 10 nM to 5 µM. The following table shows data for some examples.<br><br>

Such a reagent can be selected from the group consisting of monobromobimane (mBrB), ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-l,3-diazole-4-sulfonate (SBD-F), ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-l,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide (ABD-F), fluorescein isothiocyanate, bromomethylfluorescein, 4-aminosulfonyl-7-fluoro-2,l ,3-benzoxadiazole (ABD-F), fluorescein-5-maleimide, and 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein. Such a reagent can also be a reagent which produces a chromophore in the presence of thiols. Such a reagent can be selected from the group consisting of 4,4'-dipyrdyl disulfide (4-PDS), 2,2'- dipyrdyl disulfide (2-DPS), 2-chloro-l-methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI), 2-chloro-l-methylquinolinium tetrafluoroborate (CQMT), DTNB, 5-(2-aminoethyl)dithio-2-nitrobenzoate (ADNB), 2,2' or 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (DTDP).<br>

The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 2000 mg, especially about 1 to 500 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about l-500mg, preferably 1-200 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
Examples Example 1 4-(3-Benzenesulfonylamino-benzoyIamino)-benzoic acid<br>

A solution of 4-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester (1.95 g, 11.8 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (20.0 ml) was treated with triethylamine (1.31 g, 13.0 mmol) and cooled to 0°C. 3-Nitrobenzoyl chloride (2.00 g, 10.8 mmol) was added portionwise over 5 min. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 5 min, then at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 20 ml of saturated NaHCO3. The organic phase was separated and filtered washing with dichloromethane. Drying of the solid under high vacuum yielded 4-(3-nitro-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester as a white solid (2.52 g, 74%), MS (ISP): m/e = 315.1 (M+H+).<br>
Step	B)<br>
A solution of 4-(3-nitro-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (0.50 g, 1.59 mmol) in THF (5.0 ml) was treated with tin metal (0.38 g, 3.18 mmol) and 6N HC1 (2.5 ml). The<br>
mixture was wanned to 50°C and stirred for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue treated with 10% acqueous NaOH (10.0 ml). The resulting suspension was filtered, washing with water. The solid was dissolved in THF and treated with Na2SO4. After filtration, the filtrate was evaporated to yield 4-(3-amino-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (0.36 g, 80%) as a light yellow solid, MS (ISP): m/e = 285.3 (M+H+).<br>
Step	C)<br>
A solution of 4-(3-amino-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (50.0 mg, 0.18 mmol) in pyridine (0.40 ml) was treated with a solution of benzensulfonyl chloride (31.0 mg, 0.18 mmol) in pyridine (0.10 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated, yielding crude 4-(3-benzenesulfonylamino-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester, MS (ISP): m/e = 425.1 (M+H+), which was used as such in the next step.<br>
Step	D)<br>
A solution of crude 4-(3-benzenesulfonylamino-benzoylamino)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (75.0 mg, 0.18 mmol) in methanol (0.30 ml) was treated with a 2.55 M solution of KOH in water (0.21 ml). The mixture was stirred at 55°C for 40 min, then acidified with 2N HC1 (0.40 ml) to pH ~ 1. The mixture was diluted with 1-methyl pyrrolidinone (2.00 ml) and purified by preparative HPLC (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18, 21.2x50 mm, 5 |im, gradient acetonitrile/water + 0.1% formic acid).
