Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to breeding and utilization of coryneform bacteria used for fermentative production of L-glutamic acid and L-lysine.  In particular, the present invention relates to coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria deficient in a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (a-KGDH), a method of producing L-glutamic acid by using the bacteria, a gene coding for an enzyme having a-KGDH activity (a-KGDH gene) originating from coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria, recombinant DNA containing the gene, coryneform bacteria harboring the recombinant DNA, and a method of producing L-lysine by using bacteria harboring the recombinant DNA and having L-lysine productivity.<br>
Background Art<br>
L-glutamic acid has been hitherto industrially produced by a fermentative method using coryneform bacteria belonging to the genus Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium.<br>
Recently, it has been revealed that a mutant strain of Escherichia coli. in which the a-KGDH activity is<br><br>
deficient or lowered, and the glutamic acid-decomposing activity is lowered, has high L-glutamic acid productivity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-244970).<br>
On the contrary, it was reported that a mutant strain having lowered a-KGDH activity had approximately the same L-glutamic acid productivity as that of its parent strain in the case of a bacterium belonging to the genus Brevibacterium (Aqric. Biol. Chem.. 44, 1897 (1980), Aqric. Biol. Chem.. 46. 493 (1982)).  Therefore, it has been believed that the level of a-KGDH activity is not important for production of L-glutamic acid in coryneform bacteria.<br>
On the other hand, it was found that a mutant strain of a L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium belonging to the genus Brevibacterium having lowered a-KGDH activity produces L-glutamic acid at high efficiency (maximum yield of 53 %) when the bacterium is cultivated in a medium which contains excessive amount of biotin as a carbon source without addition of materials which suppress a effect of biotin such as penicillins and surface active agents (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 6-23779).  However, there has been no example in which an a-KGDH gene of a coryneform L-glutamic acid producing bacterium is cloned and analyzed.  Further, mutant strains of coryneform bacteria being completely deficient in a-KGDH have been unknown.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to obtain an a-KGDH gene originating from coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria, prepare recombinant DNA containing the gene, clarify the influence of the level of a-KGDH activity on fermentative production of L-glutamic acid by using microorganisms transformed with the recombinant DNA, and thus provide a new methodology in breeding of coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria.  More specifically, an object of the present invention is to obtain a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium deficient in a-KGDH activity by destroying an a-KGDH gene existing on chromosomal DNA, and provide a method of producing L-glutamic acid by using the bacterium.  Further, the present invention is contemplated to provide a coryneform bacterium harboring recombinant DNA containing an a-KGDH gene, and a method of producing L-lysine by using a coryneform bacterium harboring the recombinant DNA and having L-lysine productivity.<br>
The present inventors have obtained an a-KGDH gene originating from a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium, clarified its structure, transformed a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium by using a plasmid into which the gene is incorporated, and investigated the level of a-KGDH activity and L-glutamic<br><br>
acid productivity of obtained transformants.  As a result, it has been found that the a-KGDH activity remarkably affects production of L-glutamic acid. Further, the present inventors have found that a strain, in which the a-KGDH activity is deleted by destroying an a-KGDH gene existing on chromosome of a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium, produces and accumulates a considerable amount of L-glutamic acid when it is cultivated in a medium containing an excessive amount of biotin without adding any substance for suppressing the action of boitin such as surfactant and penicillin.  Furthermore, the present inventors have introduced recombinant DNA containing an a-KGDH gene into a coryneform bacterium having L-lysine productivity.  As a result, it has been found that the L-lysine productivity of an obtained transformant is remarkably improved.  Thus the present invention has been completed on the basis of these findings. Namely, the present invention provides:<br>
(1)	a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium deficient in a-KGDH activity due to occurrence of substitution, deletion, insertion, addition, or inversion of one or more nucleotides in a nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for an enzyme having a-KGDH activity or a promoter thereof existing on chromosome;<br>
(2)	a method of producing L-glutamic acid comprising the steps of cultivating the coryneform<br><br>
L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium described in the aforementioned item (1) in a liquid medium, producing and accumulating L-glutamic acid in a culture liquid, and collecting it;<br>
(3)	an a-KGDH gene originating from a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium;<br>
(4)	recombinant DNA obtained by ligating an a-KGDH gene originating from a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium with a vector which functions in coryneform bacteria;<br>
(5)	a coryneform bacterium harboring the recombinant DNA described in the aforementioned item (4); and<br>
(6)	a method of producing L-lysine comprising the steps of cultivating a coryneform bacterium harboring the recombinant DNA described in the aforementioned item (5) and having L-lysine productivity in a liquid medium, producing and accumulating L-lysine in a culture liquid, and collecting it.<br>

The a-KGDH gene of the present invention can be obtained as follows from chromosomal DNA of a wild strain of the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria described above, or a mutant strain derived therefrom.<br>
It is known that an a-KGDH complex of Escherichia coli is constituted by three subunits of El (a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase: EC 1.2.4.2), E2 (dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase: EC 2.3.1.61), and E3 (lipoamide dehydrogenase: 1.6.4.3), El and E2 genes forms an operon structure, and E3 is shared with<br><br>
pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1).  Nucleotide sequences of El and E2 genes of Escherichia coli have been clarified (Eur. J. Biochem.. 141. 351 (1984), Eur. J. Biochem.. 141, 361 (1984)).<br>
Also for Bacillus subtilis, nucleotide sequences of El and E2 genes have been clarified (J. Bacterid. . 171. 3667 (1989), Gene. 6i, 217 (1987), etc.).<br>
Thus by utilizing homology between the nucleotide sequences of the El genes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. the present inventors have succeeded in isolation and cloning of an a-KGDH gene originating from a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium. The following steps are provided therefor.<br>
At first, a region having high homology between El subunit genes of a-KGDH of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis is selected, and primers are synthesized according to sequences at both ends.  Any of sequences is available as the primers provided that they satisfy conditions that they have random nucleotide compositions, have G+C contents of about 50 %, form no special secondary structure, and are not complementary to one another.  Those having a length of 20-30 nucleotides are usually used.  Specifically, those shown in SEQ ID N0S:3 and 4 in Sequence Listing are exemplified.<br>
Next, a probe comprising a part of an a-KGDH gene of Bacillus subtilis is prepared from the primers and<br><br>
Bacillus subtilis chromosomal DNA by using a polymerase chain reaction method (PCR method).  Any probe having a length not less than about 20 nucleotides can be used, however, the probe desirably has a length not less than about 100 nucleotides.  The probe desirably has a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to a sequence of an objective gene, however, those having high homology can be used.<br>
On the other hand, chromosomal DNA of a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium is extracted.  DNA fragments obtained by digestion with a restriction enzyme are ligated with a vector to prepare recombinant DNA.  The recombinant DNA is used to transform Escherichia coli.  As the restriction enzyme, for example, BamHI, EcoRI, Xhol and so on are used.  As the vector, those originating from Escherichia coli, for example, pUC19 and pBR322 are used.  Any bacterial strain, which is preferable for replication of vectors, is available as a recipient strain for the recombinant DNA.  For example, bacterial strains of Escherichia coli such as HBlOl, JM109, and DH5 are used.<br>
From transformants thus obtained, strains which hybridize with the probe DNA are selected by means of colony hybridization, and recombinant DNA is recovered from such transformants.  Structures of restriction enzyme fragments of chromosomal DNA of the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium ligated with the<br><br>
vector are analyzed.<br>
An obtained DNA fragment does not necessarily contain an entire length of a gene coding for an objective enzyme.  In such a case, the chromosomal DNA of the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium is cut with another restriction enzyme, which is ligated with a vector to prepare recombinant DNA.  The recombinant DNA is used to perform transformation. Selection by colony hybridization, and analysis of restriction enzyme fragments are performed in the same manner as described above.  Thus a DNA fragment containing an entire length of the a-KGDH gene can be obtained.  During this operation, the colony hybridization can be performed more easily by using the firstly obtained DNA fragment as a probe.<br>
The DNA fragment containing the a-KGDH gene can be introduced into coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria after making recombination again with another appropriate vector.  The vector to be used is, for example, a plasmid autonomously replicable in bacteria belonging to the genus Corynebacterium.  Specifically, there are exemplified pAM330 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 58-67699), pHM1519 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 58-77895), pAJ655, pAJ611, pAJ1844 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 58-192900 for the three), pCGl (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-134500), pCG2 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 58-35197), pCG4, pCGll (Japanese Patent<br><br>
Laid-open No. 57-183799), pHK4 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491) and the like.<br>
In order to prepare the recombinant DNA by ligating the vector described above with the a-KGDH gene of the coryneform glutamic acid-producing bacterium, the vector is previously cut with a restriction enzyme.  The cutting is performed with the same restriction enzyme as that used for cutting the chromosomal DNA. Alternatively, the cutting is performed with a restriction enzyme which produces cut faces complementary to cut faces of the chromosomal DNA fragment.  Ligation is commonly performed by using a ligase such as T4 DNA ligase.<br>
Introduction of various recombinant DNA into a recipient is conducted in accordance with a transformation method having been reported until now. For example, there is a method in which permeability of DNA is increased by treating recipient cells with calcium chloride (J. Mol. Biol.. 53. 159 (1970)) as reported for Escherichia coli K-12, and there is a method in which competent cells are prepared from cells in a propagating stage to introduce DNA as reported for Bacillus subtilis (C. H. Gene. 1,   153 (1977)). Alternatively, it is also possible to apply a method in which recombinant DNA is introduced into a DNA recipient after converting cells of the DNA recipient into a state of protoplasts or spheroplasts which easily incorporate<br><br>
recombinant DNA, as known for Bacillus subtills. actinomycetes, and yeast (Molec. Gen. Genet., 168. Ill (1979), Nature. 274. 398 (1978), Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. USA. 75, 1929 (1978)).<br>
In the protoplast method, a sufficiently high frequency can be obtained even in the case of the method used in Bacillus subtilis described above.  However, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-183799, it is also possible to utilize a method wherein DNA is incorporated in a state in which protoplasts of bacterial cells belonging to the genus Corynebacterium are brought into contact with divalent metal ion and one of polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol. Incorporation of DNA can be also facilitated by adding carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, Ficoll, Bruronic F68 (produced by Selva Co.) and the like, instead of polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol.  The method for transformation used in Examples of the present invention is an electric pulse method (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791).<br>
A bacterial strain thus obtained, into which the recombinant DNA containing the a-KGDH gene originating from the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium has been introduced, is cultivated in an ordinary medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic salts, and optionally organic trace nutrients.  Thus an enzyme having a-KGDH activity can be produced in cells<br><br>
at a high level.<br>
Saccharide such as glucose, sucrose, waste molasses, and starch hydrolysate, as well as organic acids such as acetic acid and citric acid, and alcohols such as ethanol are used as the carbon source.  Urea, ammonium salts, aqueous ammonia, ammonia gas and so on are used as the nitrogen source.  Phosphates, potassium salts, magnesium salts, iron salts, manganese salts and so on are used as the inorganic salt.  Amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, nucleic acids, as well as peptone, yeast extract, soybean protein hydrolysate and so on containing them are used as the organic trace nutrient.<br>
Cultivation is performed under an aerobic condition for 10-40 hours at a temperature of 25-37 °C while controlling pH at 5-9.<br>
After completion of the cultivation, L-glutamic acid produced and accumulated in a culture liquid is quantitatively determined, and the level of a-KGDH activity of bacterial cells is measured.  The activity can be measured in accordance with a method described in Agric. Biol. Chem.. 44. 1897 (1980) or the like using a sample obtained such that bacterial cells recovered from a culture through an operation of centrifugation or the like are ground by a sonication treatment, a French Press treatment or the like, subsequently cell debris is removed by centrifugation, and low molecular weight<br><br>
substances are removed by gel filtration.<br>
Thus the relationship between the level of a-KGDH activity and the L-glutamic acid productivity has been investigated for the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium with the amplified gene and a bacterium without the amplified gene.  As a result, it has been revealed that the L-glutamic acid productivity decreases in the bacterium in which the level of a-KGDH activity is increased by amplification of the gene, as shown in Reference Example 1 described below.<br>
Utilization of the gene of the present invention includes preparation of a-KGDH activity-deficient strains by insertion of a drug-relevant gene or the like, preparation of activity-leaky strains by in vitro mutation, preparation of expression-lowered strains by modification of a promoter and so on, which makes it possible to efficiently breed a bacterial strain in which the L-glutamic acid productivity is further improved as compared with conventional coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria.<br>
A strain deficient in a-KGDH activity can be obtained either by a method which uses a chemical reagent to induce mutation, or by a method which resides in genetic recombination.  However, in the case of the method for introducing mutation by using a chemical reagent, it is relatively easy to obtain a strain in which the a-KGDH activity is lowered, but it is<br><br>
difficult to obtain a strain in which the activity is completely deficient.  In order to obtain the latter strain, it is advantageous to use a method in which an a-KGDH gene existing on chromosome is modified or destroyed by means of a genetic homologous recombination method on the basis of the structure of the a-KGDH gene having been clarified as described above.  Destruction of a gene by homologous recombination has been already established, for which it is possible to utilize a method which uses linear DNA, a method which uses a temperature-sensitive plasmid and so on.<br>
Specifically, substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion of one or a plurality of nucleotides is caused in a nucleotide sequence in a coding region or a promoter region of the a-KGDH gene by means of a site-directed mutagenesis method (Kramer, W and Frits, H. J., Methods in Enzvmology, 154, 350 (1987)) or a treatment with a chemical reagent such as sodium hyposulfite and hydroxylamine (Shortle, D. and Nathans, D., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 75. 270 (1978)).  The gene thus modified or destroyed is used to substitute a normal gene on chromosome.  It is thereby possible to delete the activity of a-KGDH as a gene product, or extinguish transcription of the a-KGDH gene.<br>
The site-directed mutagenesis method is a method which uses a synthetic oligonucleotide, which is a technique to make it possible to introduce optional<br><br>
substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion into only optional limited base pairs.  Upon the use of this method, at first a plasmid cloned and having an objective gene with a determined nucleotide sequence of DNA is denatured to prepare single strands. Subsequently a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to a portion contemplated to cause mutation is synthesized.  However, the synthetic oligonucleotide is not allowed to have a completely complementary sequence, but it is allowed to have optional nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion.  The single strand DNA is then annealed with the synthetic oligonucleotide having optional nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion.  A complete double strand plasmid is synthesized by using a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and T4 ligase, and it is introduced into competent cells of Escherichia coli.  Some of transformants thus obtained have plasmids containing genes in which the optional nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion is fixed.  A similar method which enables introduction of mutation of a gene to provide modification or destruction includes a recombinant PCR method (PCR Technology. Stockton press (1989)).<br>
On the other hand, the method which uses the chemical reagent treatment is a method in which a DNA fragment containing an objective gene is directly<br><br>
treated with sodium hyposulfite, hydroxylamine or the like, whereby mutation having nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion is randomly introduced into the DNA fragment.<br>
The method for substituting a normal gene on chromosome of a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium with the gene thus obtained by introduction of mutation to give modification or destruction includes a method which utilizes homologous recombination (Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press (1972); Matsuyama, S. and Mizushima, S., J. Bacterid.. 162. 1196 (1985)).  In the homologous recombination, when a plasmid or the like including a sequence having homology to a sequence on chromosome is introduced into a bacterial cell, recombination takes place at a certain frequency at a portion of the sequence having homology, and the entire introduced plasmid is incorporated into the chromosome.  When further recombination takes place thereafter at a portion of the sequence having homology on the chromosome, the plasmid is again separated from the chromosome and falls off.  At this time, depending on a position at which the recombination takes place, a gene with introduced mutation is occasionally fixed on the chromosome, and an original normal gene is eliminated and falls off from the chromosome together with the plasmid.  Selection of such bacterial strains makes it<br><br>
possible to obtain a bacterial strain in which a normal gene on the chromosome is substituted with a gene into which nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion is introduced to provide modification or destruction.<br>
A coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium deficient in a-KGDH activity thus obtained is remarkably more excellent in L-glutamic acid productivity especially in a medium containing an excessive amount of biotin than strains having partially lowered a-KGDH activity.<br>
In order to produce and accumulate L-glutamic acid by using the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium deficient in a-KGDH activity, the bacterium is cultivated in a liquid medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic ions, and other nutrients.  Conventionally, when the cultivation is performed in a liquid medium containing an excessive amount of biotin, it has been necessary to add a substance for suppressing biotin action, that is penicillin such as penicillin G, F, K, 0, V or X, or a surfactant comprising higher fatty acid such as sucrose monopalmitate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalraitate or a derivative thereof to the medium, in order to produce L-glutamic acid at a high yield.  However, when the coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium of the present invention deficient in a-KGDH activity is<br><br>
used, L-glutamic acid can be produced and accumulated at a high yield with high accumulation without adding any substance for suppressing biotin action as described above even if the cultivation is performed in a liquid nutrient medium containing a high concentration of biotin of 10-1000 pg/l.<br>
Namely, as the carbon source, it is also possible to use raw materials containing excessive biotin such as sugar liquid from sweet potato and beet or waste molasses, in addition to glucose, fructose, saccharified starch solution, acetic acid, etc.  Ammonium salts, aqueous ammonia, ammonia gas, urea, etc. which are used for ordinary L-glutamic acid fermentation, are used as the nitrogen source.  Additionally, inorganic ions such as phosphates and magnesium salts are appropriately used, if necessary.  Trace nutrients such as thiamine are appropriately added to the medium, if necessary.<br>
The cultivation is preferably performed under an aerobic condition.  The cultivation temperature is preferably controlled to 24-42 "C, and pH is preferably controlled to 5-9 during cultivation.  Inorganic or organic, acidic or alkaline substances, as well as urea, calcium carbonate, ammonia gas, etc. can be used for adjustment of pH.<br>
The method for collecting L-glutamic acid from a culture liquid is carried out by suitably combining known methods such as ion exchange resin treatments and<br><br>
crystallization.<br>
In order to improve the L-glutamic acid productivity, it is advantageous to enhance glutamic acid biosynthetic genes.  Examples of enhancement of the glutamic acid biosynthesis system genes include phosphofructokinase in the glycolytic pathway (PFK, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 63-102692), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in the anaplerotic pathway (PEPC, Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 60-87788 and 62-55089), citrate synthase in the TCA cycle (CS, Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 62-201585 and 63-119688), aconitate hydratase (ACQ, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 62-294086), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH, Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 62-166890 and 63-214189), glutamate dehydrogenase for amination reaction (GDH, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-268185), and so on.<br>
In order to obtain the genes described above, the following methods may be available.<br>
(1)	As a mutant strain in which mutation arises in an objective gene and a characteristic character is presented, a mutant strain is obtained wherein the character disappears by introducing the objective gene. A gene which complements the character of the mutant strain is obtained from chromosome of a coryneform bacterium.<br>
(2)	When an objective gene has been already obtained from another organism, and its nucleotide<br><br>
sequence has been clarified, the objective gene is obtained by a technique of hybridization using DNA in a region having high homology as a probe.<br>
(3)  When a nucleotide sequence of an objective gene is fairly clarified in detail, a gene fragment containing the objective gene is obtained by means of a PCR method (polymerase chain reaction method) using chromosome of a coryneform bacterium as a template.<br>
The methods described above may be used as a method for obtaining chromosome used herein.  Any host-vector system may be used provided that it is available for coryneform bacteria, for which those described above are used.  In Examples of the present invention, the method of (3) described above has been used, which is effective for a case in which the nucleotide sequence has been already clarified.<br>
When the gene is obtained in accordance with the methods of (2) and (3) described above, if an objective gene has no original promoter, the objective gene can be expressed by inserting a DNA fragment having promoter activity in coryneform bacteria into a position upstream from the objective gene.  In order to enhance expression of the objective gene, it may be available to ligate the objective gene at a position downstream from a strong promoter.  Strong promoters, which function in cells of coryneform bacteria, include lac promoter, tac promoter, trp promoter, etc. from Escherichia coli (Y. Morinaga,<br><br>
M. Tsuchiya, K. Miwa and K. Sano, J. Biotech.. 5, 305-312 (1987)).  In addition, trp promoter from a bacterium belonging to the genus Corynebacterium is also a preferable promoter (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 62-195294).  In Examples of the present invention, trp promoter from a coryneform bacterium has been used for expression of the PEPC gene.<br>
Amplification of the a-KGDH gene of the present invention is useful in coryneform bacteria having L-lysine productivity for improving their productivity.<br>
Various artificial mutant strains have been hitherto used as L-lysine-producing bacteria.  Their L-lysine productivity can be improved by using them as a host and allowing them to harbor the recombinant DNA of the present invention.  Such artificial mutant strains include the following: a mutant strain which is resistant to S-(2-aminoethyl)-cysteine (hereinafter abbreviated as "AEC"); a mutant strain which requires amino acid such as L-homoserine for its growth (Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 48-28078 and 56-6499); a mutant strain which exhibits resistance to AEC and requires amino acid such as L-leucine, L-homoserine, L-proline, L-serine, L-arginine, L-alanine, and L-valine, (United States Patent Nos. 3,708,395 and 3,825,472); an L-lysine-producing mutant strain which exhibits resistance to DL-a-amino-G-caprolactam, a-amino-lauryllactam, aspartate analog, sulfa drug.<br><br>
quinoid, and N-lauroylleucine; an L-lysine-producing mutant strain which exhibits resistance to inhibitors for oxaloacetate decarboxylase or respiratory system enzymes (Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 50-53588, 50-31093, 52-102498, 53-9394, 53-86089, 55-9783, 55-9759, 56-32995, 56-39778, and Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 53-43591, 53-1833); an<br>
L-lysine-producing mutant strain which requires inositol or acetic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 55-9784 and 56-8692); an L-lysine-producing mutant strain which exhibits sensitivity to fluoropyruvate or temperature not less than 34 °C (Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 55-9783 and 53-86090); a mutant strain of Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium which exhibits resistance to ethylene glycol and produces L-lysine (see United States Patent No. 4,411,997) and so on.<br>
Specifically, the following strains can be exemplified.<br>

Corynebacterium glutamlcum AJ12596 (FERM BP-3242, United States Patent No. 5,304,476)<br>
Introduction of the a-KGDH gene into such an L-lysine-producing bacterium may be performed through ligation with an appropriate vector as described above.<br>
The medium to be used for L-lysine production is an ordinary medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic ions, and optionally other organic trace nutrients.  Saccharide such as glucose, lactose, galactose, fructose, and starch hydrolysate, alcohols such as ethanol and inositol, and organic acids such as acetic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, and succinic acid can be used as the carbon source.  Inorganic ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium phosphate, organic nitrogen such as soybean hydrolysate, ammonia gas, aqueous ammonia, etc. can be used as the nitrogen source.  Small amounts of potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, iron ion, manganese ion, etc. are added as the inorganic ion. Appropriate amounts of required substance such as vitamin B^, yeast extract, etc. are desirably contained as the organic trace nutrient, if necessary.<br>
The cultivation is preferably carried out under an aerobic condition for 16-72 hours.  The cultivation temperature is controlled to 30-45 "C, and pH is controlled to 5-8.5 during cultivation.  Inorganic or<br><br>
organic, acidic or alkaline substances, as well as ammonia gas can be used for pH adjustment.<br>
Collection of L-lysine from a fermented liquid can be usually carried out by combining known methods such as an ion exchange resin method, a precipitation method and so on.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a restriction enzyme map of a DNA fragment containing an a-KGDH gene.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention will be more concretely explained below with reference to Examples.  For restriction enzymes, commercially available products (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) were used.<br>
Example 1: Isolation and Structural Determination of<br>
a-KGDH Gene<br>
(1) Preparation of probe<br>
A region having high homology between El subunit genes of a-KGDH of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was selected, and oligonucleotides shown in SEQ ID N0S:3 and 4 in Sequence Listing were synthesized by<br><br>
using a DNA synthesizer (Model 394 produced by Applied Biosystems) in accordance with a phosphoamidito method.<br>
The oligonucleotides (0.25 pmole) as primers, chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis NA64 (0.1 ]jg) prepared in accordance with an ordinary method (this strain was obtained from Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (Ohio University, the United States)), and Tag DNA polymerase (2.5 units) (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) were added to 0.1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing each 200 pM of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 50 mM of potassium chloride, 1.5 mM of magnesium chloride, and 0.0001 % of gelatin.  A PCR method was performed in which a cycle comprising 1 minute at 94 °C, 2 minutes at 55 °C, and 3 minutes at 72 °C was repeated 30 times.  A reaction solution was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and an objective DNA fragment was recovered by using glass powder (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.).  The DNA fragment was labeled in accordance with an ordinary method of labeling by using a Klenow fragment (produced by Amersham) and [a-^^dCTP] (produced by Amersham), and used as a probe.<br>
(2) Preparation of chromosomal DNA fragments of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869<br>
Brevibacterium 1actofermenturn ATCC13869 was inoculated to 500 ml of a T-Y medium (pH 7.2) comprising 1 % Bacto Tryptone (made by Difco), 0.5 % Bacto yeast<br><br>
extract (made by Difco), and 0.5 % sodium chloride, and cultivated at 31.5 °C for 6 hours to obtain a culture. The culture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and 2 g of wet cell pellet was obtained as a precipitate.<br>
Chromosomal DNA was extracted from the cell pellet in accordance with a method of Saito and Miura (Biochem. Biophvs. Acta.. 72. 619 (1963)).  The chromosomal DNA (2 pi) and a restriction enzyme EcoRI (200 units) were respectively mixed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM magnesium chloride, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, and reacted at a temperature of 37 °C for 15 hours.  After completion of the reaction, the solution was subjected to a phenol extraction treatment in accordance with an ordinary method, and subjected to an ethanol precipitation treatment to obtain chromosomal DNA fragments of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 digested with EcoRI.<br>
(3) Isolation of g-KGDH gene of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869<br>
A plasmid vector pUC18 (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) (1 pg) and a restriction enzyme EcoRI (20 units) were mixed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM magnesium chloride, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, and reacted at a<br><br>
imperature of 37 "C for 2 hours to obtain a digested solution.  The solution was subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation in accordance with an ordinary method.  Subsequently, in order to prevent DNA fragments originating from the plasmid vector from religation, the DNA fragments were dephosphatized by means of a bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment in accordance with a method of Molecular Cloning, 2nd edition (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pi. 60 (1989)), followed by a phenol extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation in accordance with an ordinary method.<br>
pUC18 thus digested with EcoRI (0.1 pg), the chromosomal DNA fragments of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 digested with EcoRI obtained in (2) (1 ]ig),   and T4 DNA ligase (1 unit) (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) were added to 66 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 6.6 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM adenosine triphosphate, and reacted at a temperature of 16 "C for 8 hours to ligate DNA.  Subsequently the DNA mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109 (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) in accordance with an ordinary method, which was spread on an L agar medium containing 100 pg/ml of ampicillin to obtain about 10,000 transformants.<br>
A transformant, which hybridized with the probe DNA obtained in (1), was selected from the obtained<br><br>
transformants in accordance with a method of Molecular Cloning. 2nd edition (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pi. 90 (1989)).<br>
(4) Determination of nucleotide sequence of a-KGDH gene of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869<br>
Plasmid DNA was prepared from the transformant obtained in (3) in accordance with an alkaline bacteriolysis method described in Molecular Cloning. 2nd edition (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pi. 25 (1989)). The plasmid DNA contained a DNA fragment of about 6 kilobases originating from chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869.  The plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and Xhol by using the reaction composition in (3), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis in accordance with an ordinary method.  Southern hybridization was performed in the same manner as (3) to identify a fragment which hybridized with the probe DNA.  As a result, it was revealed that a cut fragment of about 3 kilobases digested with EcoRI and Xhol hybridized.  The DNA fragment was ligated with a plasmid vector pHS397 (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) digested with EcoRI and Xhol as done in (3), and cloned.  Obtained plasmid DNA was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the<br><br>
DNA fragment.  Nucleotide sequence determination was performed in accordance with a method of Sanger (J. Mol. Biol.. 143. 161 (1980)) by using Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (produced by Applied Biochemical).<br>
Since the obtained DNA fragment did no contain a complete open reading frame, transformation was performed with a recombinant plasmid obtained by cutting chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 with Xhol. and ligating it with pHSG397 as done in (3).  A hybridizing transformant was selected by using a probe obtained by labeling the EcoRI-XhoI cut fragment of about 3 kilobases originating from chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 obtained in (2) in accordance with the method in (1).  A plasmid harbored by the obtained transformant contained a DNA fragment of about 9 kilobases.  A restriction map of a gene containing the DNA fragment is shown in Fig. 1.  The plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme Sail and Xhol by using the reaction composition in (3), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis in accordance with an ordinary method to identify the hybridizing fragment in accordance with the method in (3).  As a result, a fragment of about 4.4 kilobases was revealed.  The DNA fragment was ligated with a plasmid vector pHSG397 digested with Sail and Xhol as done in (3), and cloned.  This plasmid was designated as pHSGS-X.  A nucleotide sequence of a DNA<br><br>
fragment of about 1.4 kilobase from a Sail cut site to an EcoRI cut site in the Sall-Xhol cut fragment contained in the plasmid was determined in the same manner as described above.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the Sall-Xhol cut gene fragment thus obtained is as shown in SEQ ID N0:1 in Sequence Listing.  An open reading frame has been estimated, and an amino acid sequence of a product deduced from its nucleotide sequence is shown in SEQ ID N0S:1 and 2 in Sequence Listing.  Namely, the gene coding for a protein comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID N0:1 in Sequence Listing is the a-KGDH gene of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869.  The methionine residue located at the N-terminal of a protein originates from ATG as a start codon, and thus it is often irrelevant to an original function of the protein.  It is well-known that such a methionine residue is eliminated by the action of peptidase after translation.  Accordingly, the protein mentioned above also has a possibility of occurrence of elimination of methionine residue.<br>
The nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence were respectively compared with known sequences with respect to homology.  Used data bases were EMBL and SWISS-PROT.  As a result, it has been revealed that the DNA and the protein encoded by it shown in SEQ ID N0:1 in Sequence Listing are a novel gene and a novel protein<br><br>
in coryneform bacteria having homology to El subunit gene of a-KGDH and so on of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis having been already reported.<br>
The protein encoded by the gene of the invention comprises 1,257 amino acids including a methionine residue at the N-terminal, and has characteristics greatly different from those of a-KGDH already reported. Namely, about 900 amino acids on the C-terminal side exhibit high homology to various El subunits, however, 300 amino acids on the N-terminal side cannot be found in a-KGDH of other species, suggesting that the protein of the invention has a special function.  By comparing the portion of 300 amino acid on the N-terminal side with known sequences for homology, the portion has been found to have homology to E2 subunit of Escherichia coli and bacteria belonging to the genus Azotobacter.  This suggests a possibility that the protein of the invention is different from a-KGDH of other species, and has both activities of El and E2.<br>
In addition, sequences (281-286 and 307-312) similar to common promoter sequences found in Escherichia coli. and a sequence (422-428) similar to a ribosome-binding sequence of coryneform bacteria have been found at positions upstream from the open reading frame of the gene of the invention.  A stem &amp; loop structure (4243-4281) similar to a transcription termination signal has been found at a position<br><br>
downstream from the open reading frame of the gene of the invention.  These sequences suggest that the gene of the invention independently undergoes transcription and translation, and has a genetic structure different from those of a-KGDH of other species.<br>
Example 2; Amplification of g-KGDH Activity by<br>
Expression of a-KGDH Gene Originatino from<br>
Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869<br>
(1) Introduction of a-KGDH gene into Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 and AJ11060<br>
The pHSGS-X plasmid DNA (1 ]ig)   obtained in Example 1, and restriction enzymes Sail and Xhol (each 20 units) were mixed in the buffer described in (3) in Example 1, and reacted at a temperature of 37 °C for 3 hours.  On the other hand, plasmid pPK4 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491) DNA (1 \ig)   autonomously replicable in bacteria belonging to the genus Brevibacterium and Sail (20 units) were mixed in the buffer described in (3) in Example 1, and reacted at a temperature of 37 °C for 3 hours.  The both reaction solutions were subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation in accordance with an ordinary method.  Subsequently, in order to prevent DNA fragments originating from the plasmid vector from religation, the DNA fragments were dephosphatized by means of a bacterial alkaline<br><br>
phosphatase treatment by using the method of Example 1 (3), followed by a phenol extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation in accordance with an ordinary method.  pPK4 (0.1 pg) digested with Sail. pHSGS-X plasmid DNA (0.5 \ig)  digested with Sail and Xhol obtained as described above, and T4 DNA ligase (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) (1 unit) were mixed in the buffer described in Example 1 (3), and reacted at a temperature of 16 °C for 8 hours to ligate DNA.  Next, the DNA mixture was introduced into Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ11060 (Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-10797) in accordance with an ordinary method of transformation using an electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791).  An obtained solution was spread on an agar medium comprising 1 % polypeptone, 1 % yeast extract, 0.5 % sodium chloride, 0.5 % glucose, and 25 pg/ml kanamycin to obtain a transformant AJ11060/pPKS-X.  This transformant was designated as Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ12999, and deposited in National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology on June 6, 1994, as deposition number of FERM P-14349, and transferred from the original deposition to international deposition based on Budapest Treaty on June 2, 1995, and has been deposited as deposition number of FERM BP-5123.<br>
Plasmid DNA was extracted from the obtained<br><br>
transformant in accordance with Example 1 (4), and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in accordance with an ordinary method.  Thus recombinant DNA was selected in which the Sall-Xhol fragment originating from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 was ligated with the plasmid pPK4.  The obtained plasmid was designated as pPKS-X.<br>
A transformant ATCC 13869/pPKS-X was obtained in the same manner using Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 as a host.<br>
(2) Enzyme activity of strain with amplified g-KGDH gene<br>
Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ11060/pPKS-X and ATCC 13869/pPKS-X obtained in (1) were inoculated to 50 ml of a medium (pH 8.0) comprising 8 % glucose, 0.1 % potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.004 % magnesium sulfate, 3 % ammonium sulfate, 0.001 % ferrous sulfate, 0.001 % manganese sulfate, 0.05 % soybean hydrolysate solution, 200 pg/1 vitamin Bi, 300 ]ig/l  biotin, 5 % calcium carbonate, and 25 mg/1 kanamycin, and cultivated at 31.5 "C for 18 hours.  The culture liquid was centrifuged in accordance with an ordinary method, and cell pellet was collected.<br>
The cell pellet was washed by repeating twice an operation comprising suspending the cell pellet in a 0.2 % potassium chloride solution, and performing centrifugation.  The cell pellet was suspended in a 0.1<br><br>
M buffer (pH 7.7) of<br>
N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (hereinafter referred to as TES) containing 30 % glycerol, and treated with sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 minutes to obtain a supernatant.  This cell lysate was subjected to Sephadex G-25 (produced by Pharmacia) column chromatography, and low molecular weight substances were eliminated to prepare a crude enzyme solution.<br>
The a-KGDH activity of the obtained crude enzyme solution was measured as an increase in absorbance at 365 nm of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide by using a reaction solution of a composition described in Aqric. Biol. Chem.. 44. 1987 (1980).  The protein concentration of the crude enzyme solution was measured by using a kit produced by Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and the specific activity of the enzyme was calculated.  As controls, specific activities were determined for AJ11060/pPK4 and ATCC 13869/pPK4 obtained by transformation with the plasmid pPK4 in the same manner.  Results are shown in Table 1.  AJ11060/pPKS-X and ATCC 13869/pPKS-X respectively had specific activities which were twice or more specific activities of AJ11060/pPK4 and ATCC 13869/pPK4.  According to the results, it has been proved that the obtained gene fragment codes for an enzyme having the a-KGDH activity.<br><br><br>
As a result of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the crude enzyme solution, amplification of a band of about 135 kilodalton was observed corresponding to a molecular weight of 139 kilodalton of the enzyme expected for the obtained gene. This indicates that the obtained gene is actually expressed in the transformed strain.<br>
Reference Example 1; Relationship between g-KGDH Activity and L-glutamic acid Productivity<br>
Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ11060/pPK4 and AJ11060/pPKS-X were cultivated in an L-glutamic acid-producing medium, and L-glutamic acid produced and accumulated in a culture liquid was measured.  The cultivation was performed as follows by using a method in which a surfactant was added.<br>
A production medium (pH 8.0, 20 ml) comprising 8 % glucose, 0.1 % potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.04 %<br><br>
magnesium sulfate, 3 % ammonium sulfate, 0.001 % ferrous sulfate, 0.001 % manganese sulfate, 1.5 % soybean hydrolysate solution, 200 pg/l thiamine hydrochloride, 300 pg/1 biotin, 25 mg/1 kanamycin, and 5 % CaCOa (separately sterilized) was dispensed and poured into a Sakaguchi flask having a volume of 500 ml, and sterilized by heating.  Bacterial cells previously obtained by cultivating AJ11060/pPK4 and AJ11060/pPKS-X respectively on a plate medium (pH 7.2) comprising 1 % polypeptone (produced by Nippon Seiyaku), 1 % Bacto yeast extract (produced by Difco), 0.5 % sodium chloride, 0.5 % glucose, and 25 mg/1 kanamycin were inoculated to the medium, and cultivated at 31.5 °C for 18 hours with shaking to obtain a seed culture.<br>
The obtained seed culture was inoculated in an amount of 5 % to a production medium added with 3 g/1 of a surfactant (Tween 40: produced by Sigma) and a production medium added without the surfactant, and cultivated at 31.5 "C for 20 hours in the same manner.<br>
After completion of the cultivation, the amount of accumulated L-glutamic acid and the remaining glucose concentration in a culture liquid were measured by using a Biotech Analyzer AS-210 produced by Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.  The growth amount of bacterial cells was determined by measuring absorbance at 620 nm of a solution obtained by diluting a culture 51-fold with 0.02 N hydrochloric acid.  Results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Production of L-glutamic acid was not found at all in any of the bacterial strains in the medium in which no surfactant was added.  L-glutamic acid was produced and accumulated in the culture liquid only when the surfactant was added.  In this experiment, the yield of L-glutamic acid was remarkably decreased in the strain into which the plasmid pPKS-X containing the a-KGDH gene was introduced, as compared with the pPK4-introduced strain as a control.  This fact demonstrates that the level of a-KGDH activity greatly affects the production of L-glutamic acid based on the addition of the surfactant.<br>
Reference Example 2: Comparison of L-glutamic acid Productivity by Penicillin Addition Method<br>
The effect of a-KGDH gene amplification on<br><br>
L-glutamic acid production was investigated by means of a penicillin addition method.<br>
A seed culture was prepared in the same manner as Reference Example 1.  The seed culture was inoculated respectively to a production medium added with 0.4 unit/ml of penicillin and a production medium added with no penicillin so that the dry weight of cell pellet was about 2 %, and cultivated at 31.5 °C for about 25 hours with shaking.<br>
After completion of the cultivation, the amount of accumulated L-glutamic acid and the remaining glucose concentration in a culture liquid were measured in the same manner as Reference Example 1.  Results are shown in Table 3.  The results demonstrate that the level of a-KGDH activity also greatly affects L-glutamic acid production by the addition of penicillin.<br><br><br>
Example 3; Preparation of g-KGDH Gene-Deficient Strain<br>
According to the fact that the production of L-glutamic acid was suppressed by amplification of the a-KGDH gene, it was expected, on the contrary, that the yield of glutamic acid could be improved by destroying the a-KGDH gene.  A gene-destroyed strain was obtained by a homologous recombination method using a temperature-sensitive plasmid described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491.  Specifically, the a-KGDH gene has two sites digested by Kpnl therein at 1340th and 3266th positions in SEQ ID N0:1 in Sequence Listing. Thus pHSGS-X obtained in Example 1 was partially digested with Kpnl. and then self-ligated to prepare a plasmid pHSGS-XAK which was deficient in 1926 base pairs of a Kpnl fragment.  The a-KGDH gene on pHSGS-xAK has a structure lacking a central portion.  Next, a mutant type replication origin, which was obtained from a plasmid autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria and had temperature-sensitive autonomous replicability, was introduced into a BamHI recognition site of pHSGS-XAK to prepare a plasmid pBTS-xAK.  Specifically, a plasmid pHSC4 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491), which was obtained from a plasmid autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria and had temperature-sensitive autonomous replicability, was digested with a restriction enzyme Kpnl, blunt-ended by<br><br>
using a DNA blunt end formation kit (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Blunting kit), and then ligated with a BamHI linker (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), followed by self-ligation to obtain a plasmid which was digested with a restriction enzyme BamHI to prepare a gene fragment containing a mutant type replication origin in which the autonomous replicability was temperature-sensitive.  The gene fragment was introduced into a BamHI site of pHSGS-XAK to prepare a plasmid pBTS-XAK.<br>
This plasmid was introduced into Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 as a wild strain of a coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium by using an electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791), and an a-KGDH gene on chromosome was substituted with the deficient type by using a method described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491. Specifically, ATCC 13869/pBTS-XAK, in which the plasmid was introduced, was cultivated in an CM2G liquid medium (1 % polypeptone, 1 % yeast extract, 0.5 % NaCl, 0.5 % glucose, pH 7.2) at 25 °C for 6 hours with shaking, subsequently spread on an CM2G agar medium containing 5 Vig/ml of chloramphenicol, and cultivated at 34 °C to form colonies which were obtained as plasmid-incorporated strains.  A strain, which was sensitive to chloramphenicol at 34 °C, was obtained from the strains by using a replica method.  A nucleotide<br><br>
sequence of the a-KGDH gene on chromosome was investigated by using the sensitive strain, and it was confirmed that the a-KGDH gene was substituted into the deficient type.  The strain was designated as AS strain. When the a-KGDH activity of the AS strain was measured in accordance with the method described in Example 2, no activity was detected at all.<br>

(1) Cloning of gdh. gltA and icd genes<br>
Genes of gdh, gltA and icd of Brevibacterium lactofermentum were cloned by using a PCR method. Primers used for the PCR method were synthesized on the basis of sequences of qdh gene (Molecular Microbiology, 6(3). 317-326 (1992)), gltA gene (Microbiology. 140. 1817-1828 (1994)), and icd gene (J. Bacterid. . 177. 774-782 (1995)) of Corynebacterium glutamicum already reported.  Oligonucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOS:5 (5' side) and 6 (3' side) in Sequence Listing as primers for amplifying the qdh gene, oligonucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOS:7 (5' side) and 8 (3' side) as primers for amplifying the gltA gene, and oligonucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOS:9 (5' side) and 10 (3' side) as primers for amplifying the icd gene were respectively synthesized and used.<br><br>
Chromosomal DNA was prepared from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 in accordance with the method in Example 1, which was used as a template to perform the PCR method using the aforementioned oligonucleotides as primers.  Obtained amplified products were blunt-ended at their both ends by using a commercially available DNA blunt end formation kit (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Blunting kit), and then cloned into a Smal site of a vector plasmid pHSG399 (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) respectively to obtain plasmids pHSG-gdh, pHSG-gltA, and pHSG-icd.<br>
(2) Cloning and expression of ppc gene<br>
Chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 was prepared in accordance with the method in Example 1, and it was used as a template to obtain a DNA fragment of about 3.4 Kbp containing ppc gene coding for PEPC by using the PCR method.  Primers used for the PCR method were synthesized on the basis of a sequence of ppc gene of Corynebacterium glutamicum already reported (Gene, 77, 237-251 (1989)), and the PCR reaction was performed in the same manner as described above. Sequences of the primers are shown in SEQ ID NOSrll (5' side) and 12 (3' side).<br>
An amplified product of the PCR reaction was digested with a restriction enzyme Sail (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), and inserted into a Sail site<br><br>
of a plasmid pHSG399 to obtain a plasmid pHSG-ppc'. PEPC gene of pHSG-ppc' is inserted in a direction opposite to that of lac promoter of pHSG399.<br>
Next, a promoter of tryptophan operon known as a promoter to function in Brevibacterium lactofermentum (Gene, 53., 191-200 (1987)) was inserted at a position upstream from the ppc gene on pHSG-ppc'.  It is known that this promoter has a sequence comprising 51 nucleotides shown in SEQ ID NO:13 in Sequence Listing, and it exhibits the activity.  A nucleotide strand having the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13 and a nucleotide strand having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:14 as its complementary strand were synthesized so that double strand DNA containing the 51 base pairs having the promoter activity with both ends corresponding to cut fragments by restriction enzymes Kpnl and Xbal are obtained.<br>
The both synthesized DNA were mixed to give a concentration of 10 pmol/pg for each, heated at 100 "C for 10 minutes, and then left and cooled at room temperature to cause annealing.  pHSG-ppc' was digested with restriction enzymes Kpnl and Xbal (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), and ligated with the promoter described above.  The ligation reaction was performed by using a ligation kit produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Thus a plasmid pHSG-ppc, in which one copy of the promoter of the tryptophan operon was inserted at a<br><br>
position upstream from the ppc gene, was obtained.<br>
(3)	Preparation of plasmid constructed by ligating three<br>
species of genes of qdh, gltA and icd<br>
A plasmid was prepared in which three species of the genes of gdh, gltA and icd were ligated. Specifically, the plasmid pHSG-gdh was digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRI, and blunt-ended by using a commercially available DNA blunt end formation kit (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Blunting kit), with which the PCR-amplified product of the gltA gene with both ends blunt-ended as described above was ligated to obtain a plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA.  Further, the plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA was digested with a restriction enzyme Kpnl, and blunt-ended in the same manner, with which the PCR-amplified product of the icd gene with both ends blunt-ended as described above was ligated to obtain a plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA+icd.<br>
(4)	Preparation of plasmid constructed by ligating three<br>
species of genes of gdh, gltA and ppc<br>
A plasmid was prepared in which three species of the genes of gdh, gltA and ppc were ligated. Specifically, the plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA was digested with a restriction enzyme Kpnl.  The plasmid pHSG-ppc was digested with restriction enzymes Kpnl and Sail to obtain a ppc gene fragment having the promoter of<br><br>
tryptophan operon at an upstream position.  The obtained fragment was blunt-ended by using a DNA blunt end formation kit (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Blunting kit), and then inserted into a Kpnl site of the plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA by using a Kpnl linker (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) to obtain a plasmid pHSG-gdh+gltA+ppc.<br>
(5) Introduction of replication origin for Corynebacterium into the plasmids described above<br>
In order to allow pHSG-gdh, pHSG-gltA, pHSG-ppc, pHSG-icd, pHSG-gdh+gltA+icd, and pHSG-gdh+gltA+ppc to conduct autonomous replication in cells of coryneform bacteria, a replication origin (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491) originating from a plasmid pHM1519 autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria (Agric. Biol. Chem.. 48. 2901-2903 (1984)) already obtained was introduced into pHSG-gdh, pHSG-gltA, pHSG-ppc, pHSG-icd, pHSG-gdh+gltA+icd, and pHSG-gdh+gltA+ppc.  Specifically, a plasmid pHK4 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-7491) having the replication origin originating from pHM1519 was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and Kpnl, and a gene fragment containing the replication origin was obtained.  The obtained fragment was blunt-ended by using a DNA blunt end formation kit (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Blunting kit), and then inserted into Kpnl sites of pHSC-gdh, pHSG-gltA, pHSG-ppc, and<br><br>
pHSG-icdh respectively by using a Kpnl linker (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) to obtain pGDH, pGLTA, pPPC, and pICD.  Further, the replication origin originating from pHM1519 was inserted into pHSG-gdh+gltA+icd and pHSG-gdh+gltA+ppc respectively at their Sail sites similarly using a Sail linker (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) to obtain pGDH+GLTA+ICD and pGDH+GLTA+PPC. In addition, pSAC4 was also prepared as a control, using a plasmid pHSG399 having none of these genes, in which the replication origin originating from pHM1519 was inserted into its Sail site similarly using a Sail linker (produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.).<br>
Example 7: Confirmation of Expression of Each Gene on<br>
pGDH.  pGLTA.  pPPC.  PICD.  pGDH+GLTA+ICD,  and<br>
PGDH+GLTA+PPC<br>
It was confirmed whether or not each of the genes on pGDH, pGLTA, pPPC, piCD, pGDH+GLTA+ICD, and pGDH+GLTA+PPC was expressed in cells of Brevibacterlum lactofermentum. and these plasmids functioned for gene amplification.  Specifically, each of the plasmids was introduced into Brevibacterlum lactofermentum ATCC 13869 by means of an electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791).  Obtained transformants were selected by using a CM2G plate medium containing 10 g of polypeptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of glucose, 5 g<br><br>
of NaCl, and 15 g of agar in 1 1 of pure water (pH 7.2) and containing 4 pg/ml of chloramphenicol.  The obtained transformants were cultivated on a CM2G agar medium, inoculated to a medium containing 80 g of glucose, 1 g of KH2PO4, 0.4 g of MgS04, 30 g of (NH4)2S04, 0.01 g of FeS04«7H20, 0.01 g of MnS04«7H20, 15 ml of soybean hydrolysate solution, 200 \ig  of thiamine hydrochloride, 300 \ig  of biotin, and 50 g of CaCOj in 1 1 of pure water (with pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH), and cultivated at 31.5 °C for 16 hours.  The culture liquid was centrifuged in accordance with an ordinary method, and bacterial cells were collected.<br>
Crude extracts obtained by grinding the bacterial cells were used to measure GDH activities of ATCC 13869/pGDH, ATCC 13869/GDH+GLTA+ICD, and ATCC 13869/pGDH+GLTA+PPC in accordance with a method described in Molecular Microbiology, 6(3). 317-326 (1992).  As a result, it was found that each of these transformants had about 13-fold GDH activity as compared with ATCC 13869/PSAC4 as a control (Table 4).  The CS activity of ATCC 13869/pGLTA, ATCC 13869/GDH+CLTA+ICD, and ATCC 13869/pGDH+GLTA+PPC was measured in accordance with a method described in Microbiology, 140, 1817-1828 (1994).  The ICDH activity of ATCC 13869/pICD and ATCC 13869/GDH+GLTA+ICD was measured in accordance with a method described in J. Bacterid. 177. 774-782 (1995). The PEPC activity of ATCC 13869/pPPC and ATCC<br><br>
13869/pGDH+GLTA+PPC was measured in accordance with a method described in Gene, 77. 237-251 (1989).  Results of measurement are shown in Tables 5-7.  It was found that any transformant had about 2 to 20-fold activity of the objective enzyme as compared with ATCC 13869/pSAC4 as a control.  According to this fact, it has been confirmed that each of the genes on pGDH, pGLTA, pPPC, pICD, pGDH+GLTA+ICD, and pGDH+GLTA+PPC is expressed in cells of Brevibacterium lactofermentum. and executes its function.<br><br><br><br>

pGDH, pGLTA, pPPC, pICD, pGDH+GLTA+ICD, or pGDH+GLTA+PPC prepared as described above was introduced into the AS strain to evaluate L-glutamic acid productivity of transformants in which each of the plasmids was introduced.  Introduction of the plasmids into cells of Brevibacterium lactofermentum was performed in accordance with an electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791).  Obtained transformants were selected by using a CM2G plate medium containing 10 g of polypeptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of glucose, 5 g of NaCl, and 15 g of agar in 1 1 of pure water (pH 7.2) and containing 4 \ig/ml  of chloramphenicol.<br>
Evaluation of L-glutamic acid productivity of the As strain and the obtained transformants was performed as described in the aforementioned item(l).<br>
The bacterial cell concentration and the amount of L-glutamic acid accumulated in the medium after the cultivation were measured in the same manner as described above.  Results are shown in Table 9.<br><br><br>
pPKS-X and pPK4 prepared as described above were respectively introduced into Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ12435 (FERM BP-2294) exhibiting resistance to S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine and having L-lysine productivity derived by mutation from Brevibacterium 1actofermentum ATCC 13869, and their L-lysine productivity was evaluated.  Introduction of the plasmids was performed by using an electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791). Transformants were selected by using a CM2G plate medium containing 10 g of polypeptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of glucose, 5 g of NaCl, and 15 g of agar in 1 1 of<br><br>
pure water (pH 7.2) and containing 25 \ig/ml  of kanamycin.<br>

A medium (20 ml each) containing 100 g of glucose, 1 g of KH2PO4, 0.4 g of MgS04, 30 g of (NH4)2S04, 0.01 g of FeS04'7H20, 0.01 g of MnS04.7H20, 15 ml of soybean hydrolysate solution, 200 \ig  of thiamine hydrochloride, 300 ]ig  of biotin, 25 mg of kanamycin, and 50 g of CaCOj in 1 1 of pure water (with pH adjusted to 7.0 with KOH) was dispensed and poured into a flask having a volume of 500 ml, and sterilized by heating. Bacterial cells of AJl2435/pPK4 and AJ12435/pPKS-X obtained by cultivation on a CM2G plate medium containing 4 mg/1 of kanamycin were inoculated thereto, and cultivated at 37 "C for 20 hours.  After completion of the cultivation, the amount of L-lysine produced and accumulated in a culture liquid and the bacterial cell concentration were measured.  Results are shown in Table 10.<br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
It has been revealed that the level of a-KGDH activity of coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria affects fermentative production of L-glutamlc acid.  Therefore, it becomes possible to efficiently breed bacterial strains having further improved L-glutamlc acid productivity as compared with conventional coryneform L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria, by preparing a-KGDH gene activity-deficient strains by insertion of drug-relevant genes and so on, by preparing activity-leaky strains by in vitro mutation, and by preparing strains with lowered expression by modification of promoters and so on.<br>
