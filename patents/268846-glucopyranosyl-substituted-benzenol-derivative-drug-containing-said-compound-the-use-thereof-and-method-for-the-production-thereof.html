Diagram 1: Addition of an organ metallic compound to a gluconolactone <br>
(Figure Removed)  The reaction according to Diagram 1 is preferably carried out starting from a halo-benzylbenzene compound of general formula IV, wherein Hal denotes chlorine, bromine or iodine. Starting from the haloaromatic compound IV the corresponding organometallic compound (V) may be prepared either by means of a so-called halogen-metal exchange or by inserting the metal into the carbon-halogen bond. The halogen-metal exchange with bromine or iodine-substituted aromatic groups may be carried out for example with an organolithium compound such as e.g. n-, sec- or tert-butyllithium and thereby yields the corresponding lithiated aromatic group. The analogous magnesium compound may also be generated by a halogen-metal exchange with a suitable Grignard compound such as e.g.  opropylmagnesium bromide or diisopropylmagnesium. The reactions are preferably carried out between 0 and -100°C, particularly preferably between -10 and -80°C, in an inert solvent or mixtures thereof, such as for example diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, hexane or methylene chloride. The magnesium or lithium compounds thus obtained may optionally be transmetallised with metal salts such as e.g. cerium trichloride, to form additional organ metallic compounds (V) suitable for addition. Alternatively the organ metallic compound (V) may also be prepared by inserting a metal into the carbon-halogen bond of the halo aromatic compound IV. Metals such as e.g. lithium or magnesium are suitable for this. The addition of the organometallic compound V to gluconolactone or derivatives thereof of formula VI is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0 and -100°C, particularly preferably at -30 to -80°C, in an inert solvent or mixtures thereof, to obtain the compound of formula II. The lithiation and/or coupling reaction may also be carried out in microreaders and/or micromixers in order to avoid low temperatures; for example analogously to the processes described in WO 2004/076470.<br>
Suitable solvents are e.g. diethyl ether, toluene, methylene chloride, hexane, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof. The reactions may be carried out without any further adjuvants or in the case of unreactive coupling partners in the presence of Lewis acids such as e.g. BF3*OEt2 or MeaSiCI (see M. Schlosser, Organometallics in Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester/New York/Brisbane/Toronto/Singapore, 1994). Preferred definitions of the groups R8a, R8b, R8c and RM are benzyl, substituted benzyl, trialkylsilyl, particularly preferably trimethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, 4-methoxybenzyl and benzyl. If two adjacent groups of the group consisting of R8a, R8b, R8c and R8*3 are linked together, these two groups are preferably part of a benzylideneacetal, 4-methoxybenzylideneacetal, isopropylketal or constitute a 2,3-dimethoxy-butylene group which is linked via the 2 and 3 positions of the butane with the adjacent oxygen atoms of the pyranose ring. The group R1 preferably denotes hydrogen or Ci-4-alkyl, particularly preferably hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. The group R' is inserted after the addition of the organometallic compound V or a derivative thereof to the gluconolactone VI. For this purpose the reaction solution is treated with an alcohol such as e.g. methanol or ethanol or water in the presence of an acid such as<br>
e.g. methanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid.<br>
The synthesis of haloaromatic compound of formula IV may be carried out using standard transformations in organic chemistry or at least methods known from the specialist literature in organic synthesis (see inter alia J. March, Advanced Organic Reactions, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester/New York/Brisbane/Toronto/Singapore, 1992 and literature cited therein). The synthesis strategies described in the following provide a demonstration of this, by way of example.<br>
Diagram 2: Synthesis strategy 1<br>
(Figure Removed)  Synthesis strategy 1 (Diagram 2) shows the preparation of the haloaromatic compound of formula II starting from a benzoylchloride and a second aromatic group which is converted by Friedel-Crafts acylation into the diphenylketone derivative. This classic reaction has a wide substrate breadth and is carried out in the presence of a catalyst which is used in catalytic or stoichiometric amounts, such as e.g. AICI3, FeCI3, iodine, iron, ZnCI2, sulphuric acid or trifluoromethanesulphonic acid. Instead of the carboxylic acid chloride it is also possible to use the carboxylic acid, an anhydride or ester thereof or the corresponding benzonitrile. The reactions are preferably carried out in chlorinated hydrocarbons such as e.g. dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures from -30 to 120°C, preferably at 30 to 100°C. However, solvent-free reactions or reactions in a microwave oven are also possible. In a second reaction step the diphenylketone is reduced to the diphenylmethane. This reaction may be carried out in two steps via the corresponding diphenylmethanol or in one step. In the two-step variant the ketone is reduced with a reducing agent such as for example a metal hydride such as e.g. NaBH4, LiAIH4 or iguanid to form the alcohol. The resulting alcohol can be converted in the presence of a Lewis acid such as for example BF3*OEt2, trifluoroacetic acid, lnCI3 or AICI3 with a reducing agent such as e.g. Et3SiH, NaBH4, or Physical to form the desired diphenylmethane. The one-step process starting from the ketone to obtain the diphenylmethane may be carried out e.g. with a silane such as e.g. Et3SiH, a borohydride such as e.g. NaBH4 or an aluminium hydride such as LiAIH4 in the presence of a Lewis acid such as for example BF3*OEt.2, tris(pentafluorophenyl)-borane, trifluoroacetic acid, aluminium chloride or lnCI3. The reactions are preferably carried out in solvents such as e.g. halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, toluene or acetonitrile at temperatures of -30 to 150°C, preferably at 20 to 100°C. Reductions with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such as e.g. Pd on charcoal are another possible method of synthesis. Reductions according to Wolff-Kishner or variants thereof are also possible. The ketone is first of all converted with hydrazine or a derivative thereof, such as e.g. 1,2-bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)hydrazine, into the hydrazone which breaks down under strongly basic reaction conditions and heating to form the diphenylmethane and nitrogen. The reaction may be carried out in one reaction step or after isolation of the hydrazone or a derivative thereof in two separaten reaction steps. Suitable bases include e.g. KOH, NaOH or KOtBu in solvents such as e.g. ethyleneglycol, toluene, DMSO, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol ort-butanol; solvent-free reactions are also possible. The reactions may be carried out at temperatures between 20 to 250°C, preferably between 80 to 200°C. An alternative to the basic conditions of the Wolff-Kishner reduction is the Clemmensen reduction which takes place under acid conditions, which may also be used here.<br><br><br><br>
The second synthesis strategy (Diagram 3) shows another possible way of synthesising the halogen-aromatic groups of formula II' illustrated by the example of a trimethylsilylacetylene-substituted diphenylmethane. Starting from an aromatic group which carries two groups selected from among iodine, bromine, chlorine or sulphonate such as e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonate, an alkyne group is attached via a transition metal-catalysed monocoupling to the more reactive end of the dihaloaromatic compound, the iodine-carbon bond (step 1). The catalysts used are for example elemental palladium or nickel or salts or complexes thereof. The reactions may be carried out with the alkyne itself or metal acetylidene therefrom. If the alkyne itself is used, coupling may be carried out in the presence of a base such as e.g. Net/? and a co-catalyst such as e.g. a copper salt such as Cut (Sonogashira coupling). The reactions are not limited to trimethylsilylacetylene, but allow the use of a number of terminal alkynes. The reaction is extensively documented with all its variations in the literature (see P.J. Stang, F. Diederich, Metal-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1997 and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 1566-1568 and literature cited therein). The other two steps for preparing the diphenylmethane derivatives comprise transfunctionalising the alkyne-substituted aromatic group to obtain a metallised (Mg, Li) aromatic group which may be prepared, for example, by a halogen-metal exchange as described hereinbefore (step 2). This metallised aromatic compound which may be used directly or after further transmetallation, is added to a benzaldehyde derivative. This forms the diphenylmethanol shown in the diagram. Alternatively it is also possible to use a benzoic acid derivative such as e.g. a benzoic acid ester, anhydride, chloride or the acid itself or the benzonitrile. Instead of the alcohol the corresponding ketone is formed, which may also be obtained by Friedel-Crafts acylation as described above. Further reaction of both the alcohol and the ketone to form the diphenylmethane derivative has already been described above (step 3). The trimethylsilylethynylated aromatic halogen compound may however also be converted directly after transmetallation into the desired product (step 4). For this, the lithium or magnesium aromatic group obtained after a halogen-metal exchange is reacted with a benzylelectrophil such as e.g. a benzyl bromide or chloride. The reaction may be carried out without or, better still, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as e.g. a copper salt or a palladium complex (see e.g. Org. Lett. 2001, 3, 2871-2874 and literature cited therein). The aromatic lithium or magnesium group may however also be transmetallised first, for example, to obtain the corresponding boric acids, boric acid esters, stannanes, silanes or zinc compounds. Then it is attached by means of a transition metal such as e.g. palladium, nickel, rhodium, copper or iron to the benzyl group (see L. Brandsma, S.F. Vasilevsky, H.D. Verkruijsse, Application of Transition Metal Catalysts in Organic Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg, 1998). The reactions of the alkyne-substituted aromatic group to the intermediate product of formula II1 according to steps 2 and 3 or step 4, which are illustrated by way of example here for R3 denoting ethynyl or trimethylsilylethynyl, may also be carried out analogously with other R3-substituted aromatic groups.<br>
(Figure Removed)  Synthesis strategy 3 (Diagram 4) shows an alternative form of synthesis strategy 2, which is also illustrated using the example of an aromatic trimethylsilylethynyl group II1, but should not be limited thereto. The synthesis starts with an aromatic group which carries both a Hal group, which denotes a halogen atom chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a pseudohalogen group, such as e.g. trifluoromethanesulphonate, and also a metallic centre M, such as e.g. a B(OH)2, Si(OAIk)3 or SnBua group. The two centres thus "activated" may be exchanged chemoselectively one after the other. Synthesis strategy 3 illustrates this with an example in which first of all the halogen atom Hal is exchanged for an alkyne substituent in a transition metal-catalysed reaction such as e.g. the so-called Sonogashira coupling. In the second step the metallic centre M is exchanged for a benzyl group which is activated e.g. as the benzyl halide in another transition metal-catalysed coupling, to obtain the desired product (see e.g. Tetrahedron Lett. 2003, 44, 9255-9258 and literature cited therein). Both steps may be carried out using transition metals such as e.g. palladium, rhodium, nickel, copper or iron, or complexes thereof. Both types of reaction are described in detail in the literature. The method is not restricted to that shown here but may also involve reverseing the sequence of the two reaction steps. In this case, the metallic centre M is first linked to the benzyl group and then the halogen or pseudohalogen group Hal is exchanged for the alkyne. In order to prepare compounds of general formula I, in process a) according to the invention, a compound of general formula II<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R1 to R5 are as hereinbefore defined and (Figure Removed)<br>
pea p8b Rsc R8d are as nerejn5efore defined and independently of one another represent for example acetyl, pivaloyl, benzoyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, trialkylsilyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl or in each case two adjacent groups R8a, R8b, R8c, RM form a benzylideneacetal or isopropylideneketal or a 2,3-dimethoxy-butylene group which is linked via position 2 and 3 of the butylene group to the oxygen atoms of the pyranose ring and forms with them a substituted dioxane,<br>
which may be obtained as hereinbefore described, is reacted with a reducing agent in the presence of a Lewis or Br0nsted acid.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for the reaction include for example silanes, such as triethyl, tripropyl, triisopropyl or diphenylsilane, sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, zinc borohydride, boranes, lithium aluminium hydride, diisobutylaluminium hydride or samarium iodide. The reductions are carried out without or in the presence of a suitable Br0nsted acid, such as e.g. hydrochloric acid, toluenesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid, or Lewis acid, such as e.g. boron trifluoride etherate, trimethylsilyltriflate, titaniium tetrachloride, tin tetrachloride, scandium triflate or zinc iodide. Depending on the reducing agent and the acid the reaction may be carried out in a solvent, such as for example methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile, toluene, hexane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethanol, water or mixtures thereof at temperatures between -60°C and 120°C. One particularly suitable combination of reagents consists for example of triethylsilane and boron trifluoride etherate, which is conveniently used in acetonitrile or dichloromethane at temperatures of-60°C and 60°C. Moreover, hydrogen may be used in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as e.g. palladium on charcoal or Raney nickel, in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, water or acetic acid, for the transformation described.<br>
Alternatively, in order to prepare compounds of general formula I according to process b) according to the invention, in a compound of general formula III<br>
(Figure Removed)  wherein R1 to R5 are as hereinbefore defined and<br>
R8a to R^ denote one of the protective groups defined hereinbefore, such as e.g. an acyl, arylmethyl, acetal, ketal or silyl group, and which may be obtained for example by reduction from the compound of formula II as hereinbefore described, the protective groups are cleaved.<br>
Any acyl protecting group used is cleaved for example hydrolytically in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or aprotically, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 120°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 100°C. A trifluoroacetyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as acetic acid at temperatures between 50 and 120°C or by treating with sodium hydroxide solution optionally in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methanol at temperatures between 0 and 50°C.<br>
Any acetal or ketal protecting group used is cleaved for example hydrolytically in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or aprotically, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 120°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 100°C.<br>
A trimethylsilyl group is cleaved for example in water, an aqueous solvent mixture or a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of a base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate or sodium methoxide. In aqueous or alcoholic solvents, acids such as e.g. hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid are also suitable. For cleaving in organic solvents, such as for example diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane, it is also suitable to use fluoride reagents, such as e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
A benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is advantageously cleaved hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or glacial acetic acid, optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at temperatures between 0 and 100°C, but preferably at ambient temperatures between 20 and 60°C, and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably 3 to 5 bar. A 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, however, is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole.<br>
A tert.butyl or tert.butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid or by treating with iodotrimethylsilane optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane, methanol or diethylether.<br>
In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as ethynyl, hydroxy, amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction.<br>
For example, a protecting group for an ethynyl group may be the trimethylsilyl or triisopropyl group. The 2-hydroxisoprop-2-yl group may also be used as a protective group.<br>
For example, a protecting group for a hydroxy group may be a trimethylsilyl, acetyl, trityl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group.<br>
Protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be, for example, a formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers, as mentioned hereinbefore. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their c/'s and trans isomers, and compounds with at least one optically active carbon atom may be separated into their enantiomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the cis/trans mixtures may be resolved by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a (+)-or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
Moreover, the compounds obtained may be converted into mixtures, for example 1:1 or 1:2 mixtures with amino acids, particularly with alpha-amino acids such as proline or phenylalanine, which may have particularly favourable properties such as a high crystallinity.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are advantageously also obtainable using the methods described in the examples that follow, which may also be combined for this purpose with methods known to the skilled man from the literature, for example, particularly the methods described in WO 98/31697, WO 01/27128, WO 02/083066, WO 03/099836 and WO 2004/063209.<br>
As already mentioned, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly an inhibitory effect on the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter SGLT, preferably SGLT2.<br>
The biological properties of the new compounds may be investigated as follows:<br>
The ability of the substances to inhibit the SGLT-2 activity may be demonstrated in a test set-up in which a CHO-K1 cell line (ATCC No. CCL 61) or alternatively an HEK293 cell line (ATCC No. CRL-1573), which is stably transfected with an expression vector pZeoSV (Invitrogen, EMBL accession number L36849), which contains the cDNA for the coding sequence of the human sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (Genbank Ace. No.NM_003041) (CHO-hSGLT2 or HEK-hSGLT2). These cell lines transport 14C-labelled alpha-methyl-glucopyranoside (14C-AMG, Amersham) into the interior of the cell in sodium-dependent manner.<br>
The SGLT-2 assay is carried out as follows:<br>
CHO-hSGLT2 cells are cultivated in Ham's F12 Medium (BioWhittaker) with 10% foetal calf serum and 250 ug/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), and HEK293-hSGLT2 cells are cultivated in DMEM medium with 10% foetal calf serum and 250 ug/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). The cells are detached from the culture flasks by washing twice with PBS and subsequently treating with trypsin/EDTA. After the addition of cell culture medium the cells are centrifuged, resuspended in culture medium and counted in a Casy cell counter. Then 40,000 cells per well are seeded into a white, 96-well plate coated with poly-D-lysine and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. The cells are washed twice with 250 ul of assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 137 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 2.8 mM CaCI2, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 50 ug/ml of gentamycin). 250 ul of assay buffer and 5 ul of test compound are then added to each well and the plate is incubated for a further 15 minutes in the incubator. 5 pi of 10% DMSO are used as the negative control. The reaction is started by adding 5 pi of 14C-AMG (0.05 uCi) to each well. After 2 hours' incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, the cells are washed again with 250 ul of PBS (20°C) and then lysed by the addition of 25 ul of 0.1 N NaOH (5 min. at 37°C). 200 ul of MicroScint20 (Packard) are added to each well and incubation is continued for a further 20 min at 37°C. After this incubation the radioactivity of the 14C-AMG absorbed is measured in a Topcount (Packard) using a 14C scintillation program.<br>
To determine the selectivity with respect to human SGLT1 an analogous test is set up in which the cDNA for hSGLTI (Genbank Ace. No. NM000343) instead of hSGLT2 cDNA is expressed in CHO-K1 or HEK293 cells.<br>
The compounds of general formula I according to the invention may for example have EC50 values below 1000 nM, particularly below 200 nM, most preferably below 50 nM.<br>
In view of their ability to inhibit the SGLT activity, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are theoretically suitable for the treatment and/or preventative treatment of all those conditions or diseases which may be affected by the inhibition of the SGLT activity, particularly the SGLT-2 activity. Therefore, compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable for the prevention or treatment of diseases, particularly metabolic disorders, or conditions such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, complications of diabetes (such as e.g. retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathies, diabetic foot, ulcers, macroangiopathies), metabolic acidosis or ketosis, reactive hypoglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, glucose metabolic disorder, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemias of different origins, atherosclerosis and related diseases, obesity, high blood pressure, chronic heart failure, oedema and hyperuricaemia. These substances are also suitable for preventing beta-cell degeneration such as e.g. apoptosis or necrosis of pancreatic beta cells. The substances are also suitable for improving or restoring the functionality of pancreatic cells, and also of increasing the number and size of pancreatic beta cells. The compounds according to the invention may also be used as diuretics or antihypertensives and are suitable for the prevention and treatment of acute renal failure.<br>
In particular, the compounds according to the invention, including the physiologically acceptable salts thereof, are suitable for the prevention or treatment of diabetes, particularly type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and/or diabetic complications.<br>
The dosage required to achieve the corresponding activity for treatment or prevention usually depends on the compound which is to be administered, the patient, the nature and gravity of the illness or condition and the method and frequency of administration and is for the patient's doctor to decide. Expediently, the dosage may be from 1 to 100 mg, preferably 1 to 30 mg, by intravenous route, and 1 to 1000 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, by oral route, in each case administered 1 to 4 times a day.

Other active substances which are suitable for such combinations include for example those which potentiate the therapeutic effect of an SGLT antagonist according to the invention with respect to one of the indications mentioned and/or which allow the dosage of an SGLT antagonist according to the invention to be reduced. Therapeutic agents which are suitable for such a combination include, for example, antidiabetic agents such as metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide, tolbutamide, glimepiride), nateglinide, repaglinide, thiazolidinediones (e.g. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), PPAR-gamma-agonists (e.g. Gl 262570) and antagonists, PPAR-gamma/alpha modulators (e.g. KRP 297), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose, voglibose), DPPIV inhibitors (e.g. LAF237, MK-431), alpha2-antagonists, insulin and insulin analogues, GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues (e.g. exendin-4) or amylin. The list also includes inhibitors of protein tyrosinephosphatase 1, substances that affect deregulated glucose production in the liver, such as e.g. inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase, orfructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucagon receptor antagonists and inhibitors of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, glycogen synthase kinase or pyruvate dehydrokinase, lipid lowering agents such as for example HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin), fibrates (e.g. bezafibrate, fenofibrate), nicotinic acid and the derivatives thereof, PPAR-alpha agonists, PPAR-delta agonists, ACAT inhibitors (e.g. avasimibe) or cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as, for example, ezetimibe, bile acid-binding substances such as, for example, cholestyrarnine, inhibitors of ileac bile acid transport, HDL-raising compounds such as CETP inhibitors or ABC1 regulators or active substances for treating obesity, such as sibutramine or tetrahydrolipostatin, dexfenfluramine, axokine, antagonists of the cannabinoidl receptor, MCH-1 receptor antagonists, MC4 receptor agonists, NPY5 or NPY2 antagonists or (i3-agonists such as SB-418790 or AD-9677 and agonists of the 5HT2c receptor.<br>
Moreover, combinations with drugs for influencing high blood pressure, chronic heart failure or atherosclerosis such as e.g. A-ll antagonists or ACE inhibitors, ECE inhibitors, diuretics, fi-blockers, Ca-antagonists, centrally acting antihypertensives, antagonists of the alpha-2-adrenergic receptor, inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors and others or combinations thereof are suitable. Examples of angiotensin II receptor antagonists are candesartan cilexetil, potassium losartan, eprosartan mesylate, valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan, EXP-3174, L-158809, EXP-3312, olmesartan, medoxomil, tasosartan, KT-3-671, GA-0113, RU-64276, EMD-90423, BR-9701, etc. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are preferably used for the treatment or prevention of high blood pressure and complications of diabetes, often combined with a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide.<br>
A combination with uric acid synthesis inhibitors or uricosurics is suitable for the treatment or prevention of gout.<br>
A combination with GABA-receptor antagonists, Na-channel blockers, topiramat, protein-kinase C inhibitors, advanced glycation end product inhibitors or aldose reductase inhibitors may be used for the treatment or prevention of complications of diabetes.<br>
The dosage for the combination partners mentioned above is usefully 1/5 of the lowest dose normally recommended up to 1/1 of the normally recommended dose.<br>
Therefore, in another aspect, this invention relates to the use of a compound according to the invention or a physiologically acceptable salt of such a compound combined with at least one of the active substances described above as a combination partner, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition which is suitable for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions which can be affected by inhibiting the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter SGLT. These are preferably metabolic diseases, particularly one of the diseases or conditions listed above, most particularly diabetes or diabetic complications.<br>
The use of the compound according to the invention, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with another active substance may take place simultaneously or at staggered times, but particularly within a short space of time. If they are administered simultaneously, the two active substances are given to the patient together; while if they are used at staggered times the two active substances are given to the patient within a period of less than or equal to 12 hours, but particularly less than or equal to 6 hours.<br>
Consequently, in another aspect, this invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound according to the invention or a physiologically acceptable salt of such a compound and at least one of the active substances described above as combination partners, optionally together with one or more inert carriers and/or diluents.<br>
Thus, for example, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention comprises a combination of a compound of formula I according to the invention or a physiologically acceptable salt of such a compound and at least one angiotensin II receptor antagonist optionally together with one or more inert carriers and/or diluents.<br>
The compound according to the invention, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, and the additional active substance to be combined therewith may both be present together in one formulation, for example a tablet or capsule, or separately in two identical or different formulations, for example as a so-called kit-of-parts.<br>

A solution of 4.0 g [4-(5-bromo-2-chloro-benzyl)-phenoxy]-tert-butyl-dimethyl-silane in 42 ml dry diethyl ether is cooled to -80°C under argon. 11.6 ml of a 1.7 M solution of tert-butyllithium in pentane are slowly added dropwise to the cooled solution, and then the solution is stirred for 30 min at -80°C. This solution is then added dropwise through a transfer needle, which is cooled with dry ice, to a solution of 4.78 g 2,3,4,6-tetrakis-O-(trimethylsilyl)-D-glucopyranone in 38 ml diethyl ether chilled to -80°C. The resulting solution is stirred for 3 h at -78°C. Then a solution of 1.1 ml methanesulphonic acid in 35 ml of methanol is added and the solution is stirred for 16 h at ambient temperature. The solution is then neutralised with solid sodium hydrogen carbonate, ethyl acetate is added and the methanol is removed together with the ether. Aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution is added to the remaining solution and extracted four times with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated down. The residue is dissolved in 30 ml acetonitrile and 30 ml dichloromethane and the solution is cooled to -10°C. After the addition of 4.4 ml triethylsilane 2.6 ml boron trifluoride etherate are added dropwise so that the temperature does not exceed -5°C. After the addition has ended the solution is stirred for another 5 h at -5 to -10°C and then quenched by the addition of aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic phase is separated off and the aqueous phase is extracted four times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase are dried over sodium sulphate, the solvent is removed and the residue is purified using silica gel.
