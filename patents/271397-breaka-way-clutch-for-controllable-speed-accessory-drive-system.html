				<td>BREAKAWAY CLUTCH FOR CONTROLLABLE SPEED<br>
ACCESSORY DRIVE SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention pertains generally to controllable speed accessory<br>
drive systems for motorized vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	In conventional motor vehicles, i.e., automobiles propelled solely by an<br>
internal combustion engine, vehicle accessories such as hydraulic pumps, water pumps,<br>
vacuum pumps, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) compressors are<br>
powered directly from the internal combustion engine. The power requirements of these<br>
accessories may be steady over extended periods of time, as in the case of water pumps<br>
used to help cool the engine, or may be required in short bursts, as in the case of<br>
hydraulic accessories or air brakes. Regardless, accessory speed is typically proportional<br>
to engine speed despite the varying power demand of the accessories.<br>
[0003]	Conventional automotive accessory drive systems include a drive pulley<br>
connected to the engine's crankshaft. A flexible chain or belt couples the drive pulley<br>
with a plurality of driven pulleys that are each operatively connected to an individual<br>
accessory. In hybrid vehicles which employ an internal combustion engine with one or<br>
more electric motors for propulsion, either in series or in parallel, these same accessories<br>
(e.g., an electrically-driven A/C compressor or an electrically-driven vacuum pump for a<br>
brake booster) are often powered from the internal combustion engine in much the same<br>
manner as in conventional motor vehicles.<br>
[0004]	Since the drive pulley and belt are actuated directly by the crankshaft, they<br>
are necessarily subject to engine speed variations during vehicle acceleration and<br>
deceleration.   In other words, the operating speeds of the accessories in such<br>
conventional drive systems are directly proportional to the speed of the engine. Since the<br>
engine operates over a wide speed range (e.g., from as low as 500 rpm at idle to as high<br>
as 8,000 rpm at full capacity) the accessories are typically designed to be fully functional<br>
at the low end of the engine speed range in order to ensure that they can remain<br><br>
operational. Consequently, when the engine is operating at higher speeds, conventional<br>
accessory drive systems may transfer more energy to the accessories than necessary to<br>
provide adequate function.<br>
[0005]	The above discussed matter is further complicated for hybrid vehicles<br>
with an engine stop-start feature because, under certain operating conditions the engine is<br>
shut down to save fuel, yet the accessories need to remain operational. Further, for a<br>
belt-alternator-starter type hybrid, it is desirable to be able to start the engine with the<br>
alternator-starter without impacting the operation of the accessories.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	Provided herein is a controllable speed accessory drive system for a motor<br>
driven vehicle, preferably of the hybrid type. The controllable speed accessory drive<br>
system described below reduces parasitic energy consumption, thereby enhancing fuel<br>
economy, and also provides for improved system durability and reduced noise.<br>
[0007]	The accessory drive system includes an engine, one or more vehicle<br>
accessories, a gear train, a motor/generator, a first selectively engageable torque<br>
transmitting device, and a breakaway clutch. The gear train operatively connects the<br>
engine to the vehicle accessories to permit the engine to drive the accessories. The<br>
motor/generator is connected to the gear train in order to drive the various vehicle<br>
accessories at a selectable rate that is independent of the engine speed. The<br>
motor/generator is also configured to re-start the engine while simultaneously powering<br>
the various vehicle accessories.<br>
[0008]	The first selectively engageable torque transmitting device, which is<br>
preferably either a one-way clutch or brake, is operatively connected between a stationary<br>
member and the gear train such that it can provide the reaction torque necessary to allow<br>
the accessories to be driven by the motor/generator when the engine is off. A breakaway<br>
clutch is operatively engaged with and configured to ground the first selectively<br>
engageable torque transmitting device below a predetermined torque (or torque capacity),<br>
and to slip or disengage at or above the predetermined torque, thereby breaking the<br>
connection of the first selectively engageable torque transmitting device with the<br>
stationary member.<br><br>
[0009]	The breakaway clutch is disposed in series torque transmitting relation with<br>
the first torque transmitting device in order to disengage first torque transmitting device<br>
from the stationary member. Preferably, the torque capacity of the breakaway clutch is<br>
greater than a grounding torque required to allow the various accessories to operate at<br>
maximum capacity, yet less than a predetermined spike load, above which damage would<br>
result to the accessory drive system. Ideally, the breakaway clutch includes one or more<br>
friction plates individually interposed between an apply plate and one or more reaction<br>
plates. A biasing member, preferably of the Belleville-spring type, is operatively<br>
connected to the apply plate and configured to apply a predetermined load thereto.<br>
[0010]	The accessory drive system will preferably include a controller or<br>
electronic control unit (ECU) operatively connected to the engine and motor/generator.<br>
The controller is configured to control the speed of the motor/generator in order to<br>
optimize the speed at which the accessories are run, thereby further reducing parasitic<br>
energy consumption.<br>
[0011]	Optimally, the controllable speed accessory drive system includes a<br>
plurality of torque transfer apparatuses that are disposed between the engine and the<br>
various vehicle accessories and configured to transfer power therebetween. The torque<br>
transfer apparatus may include a plurality of pulleys connected by a belt member.<br>
Alternatively, the torque transfer apparatus may include a plurality of sprockets<br>
connected by a chain member.<br>
[0012]	The gear train is preferably a planetary gear set having first, second, and<br>
third members. Ideally, the engine is connected to the first member of the planetary gear<br>
set. while the motor/generator is operatively connected to the second member and the<br>
accessories are operatively connected to the third member.<br>
[0013]	According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first<br>
member of the planetary gear set is a planet carrier assembly, the second member is a sun<br>
gear member, while the third member is a ring gear member.<br>
[0014]	According to an alternate embodiment, the first member of the planetary<br>
gear set is the planet carrier assembly, the second member is the ring gear member, while<br>
the third member is the sun gear member.<br><br>
[0015]	It is preferred that the accessory drive system also include a second<br>
selectively engageable torque transmitting device. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
second torque transmitting device is a selectively engageable one-way clutch operatively<br>
connected to the gear train, namely the ring gear and planet carrier assembly. The second<br>
torque transmitting device is configured to enable the engine to power the accessories<br>
directly without power input from the motor/generator.<br>
[0016]	The above features and advantages, and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the preferred embodiments and best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in<br>
connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0017]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration depicting a controllable speed<br>
accessory drive system for a hybrid vehicle in accordance with the present invention; and<br>
[0018]	FIGURE 2 is a schematic, cross-sectional view of a controllable speed<br>
accessory drive system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to the figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to like or<br>
similar components throughout the several views, Figure 1 is a schematic representation<br>
of a controllable speed accessory drive system, shown generally at 10, for a motorized<br>
vehicle. The accessory drive system 10 is preferably incorporated into a series hybrid<br>
vehicle, identified generally as 11 in Fig. 1, but can also be incorporated into other types<br>
of vehicles (e.g., conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, electric vehicles,<br>
etc.) across various platforms (e.g., passenger car, light truck, heavy duty, and the like.)<br>
The types of vehicle accessories that may be driven using the accessory drive system 10<br>
of the present invention include compressors, such as brake air compressors or air<br>
conditioning compressors, hydraulic pumps, such as those used for power steering or<br>
other heavy duty hydraulic equipment, water pumps, and vacuum pumps (for instance, to<br>
operate a brake booster.)<br><br>
[0020]	The accessory drive system 10 includes an engine 12 configured to<br>
transmit power (e.g., by way of torque) to a crank pulley 14 via an engine output shaft,<br>
such as crankshaft 16. A first belt 18 couples the crank pulley 14 with an accessory drive<br>
input pulley 20. The accessory drive input pulley 20 is operatively connected to a<br>
differential gear system, also referred to in the art as a gear train, preferably in the nature<br>
of planetary gear set 22.<br>
[0021]	The planetary gear set 22 employs an outer gear member, typically<br>
designated as the ring gear 28. The ring gear member 28 circumscribes an inner gear<br>
member, typically designated as the sun gear 24. A carrier member, such as planet<br>
carrier assembly 30, rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 26 such that each of the<br>
planet gears 26 meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 28 and the inner, sun<br>
gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 22. It should be understood that the planet<br>
carrier assembly 30 may be of the single- or the double-pinion carrier type, without<br>
departing from the intended scope of the present invention.<br>
[0022]	The planetary gear set 22 is configured to convert the rotational speed of<br>
the accessory drive input pulley 20, which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed, to a<br>
predetermined value selected to efficiently drive a plurality of vehicle accessories 38. In<br>
other words, the planetary gear set 22 selectively increases or decreases the magnitude of<br>
torque transmitted from the accessory drive input pulley 20 to the accessories 38 to more<br>
closely coincide with the actual power requirements of the accessories 38, thereby<br>
minimizing parasitic energy losses over traditional accessory drive systems.<br>
[0023]	Power from the planetary gear set 22 (e.g., torque) is transferred to an<br>
accessory drive output pulley 32. A second belt 34 couples the accessory drive output<br>
pulley 32 with one or more accessory pulleys 36. The accessory pulleys 36 are each<br>
operatively connected to respective one of a plurality of accessories 38. Notably, the<br>
various input and output pulleys and corresponding belts described herein can be replaced<br>
by connecting shafts, belt and sprocket assemblies, or intermeshing gears without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0024]	The engine 12 also transfers torque via the crankshaft 16 to a transmission<br>
17. The transmission 17 transfers output from the engine 12 to a final drive system,<br>
represented herein by a plurality of wheels 19, in order to propel the hybrid vehicle 11.<br><br>
In the embodiment depicted, the engine 12 may be a fossil fuel engine, such as a 3- or 4-<br>
stroke gasoline or diesel engine, which is readily adapted to provide its available power<br>
output typically delivered at a constant number of revolutions per minute (RPM). It<br>
should also be appreciated that the transmission 17 and wheels 19 may include any<br>
known configuration, e.g., front wheel drive (FWD), rear wheel drive (RWD), four-wheel<br>
drive (4WD), or all wheel drive (AWD). Thus, the accessory drive system 10 of the<br>
present invention is not intended to be restricted to the exemplary vehicle configuration<br>
set forth in Fig. 1.<br>
[0025]	Still referring to Fig. 1, the accessory drive system 10 also includes a<br>
motor/generator 40. The motor/generator 40 is configured to selectively operate as a<br>
motor, a generator, or it can be turned off to reduce rotational resistance. For instance,<br>
the motor/generator 40 is configured to selectively transfer torque to and/or receive<br>
torque from the planetary gear set 22, either directly, e.g., via shaft 41, or through an off-<br>
set drive such as, for example, a belt, chain, gear set, another differential gear set, or<br>
combinations thereof (all represented generally in phantom at 43 in Fig. 1.) The<br>
motor/generator 40 is also configured to receive power from and/or transfer power to a<br>
storage device, such as a battery 46. Alternatively, the storage device can be a fuel cell,<br>
capacitor, fly wheel, and the like.<br>
[0026]	The motor/generator 40 is controllable to drive the accessories 38 at a<br>
predetermined rate regardless of engine speed. By transferring a first predetermined<br>
amount of input torque from the engine 12 to one of the members of the planetary gear<br>
set 22, and transferring a second predetermined amount of input torque from the<br>
motor/generator 40 to another one of the members of the planetary gear set 22, the<br>
planetary gear set 22 can be controlled to produce a selectable amount of output torque<br>
from yet another of its members. Therefore, by controlling the status of the<br>
motor/generator 40 (i.e., either "motor", "generator", or "off), and by controlling the<br>
amount of torque transferred from the motor/generator 40 to the planetary gear set 22, the<br>
planetary gear set 22 output speed is selectable within an operational range. Significant<br>
vehicle fuel economy gains are realized when the speeds of the accessories 38 are<br>
controlled to be independent of the engine speed.<br><br>
[0027]	The accessory drive system 10 also includes a controller, depicted in Fig. 1<br>
in an exemplary embodiment as a micro-processor based electronic control unit (ECU)<br>
42, having programmable memory 45. The engine 12 and the motor/generator 40 are<br>
operatively connected to the controller 42 (e.g., via electric cables, radio frequency or<br>
other wireless technology, or by electro-mechanical communication.) The controller 42<br>
is configured or programmed to control the operation of the engine 12 and<br>
motor/generator 40. For instance, the controller 42 is programmed or configured to<br>
receive input, such as sensor signals S, from the engine 12 indicating the current engine<br>
speed. The controller 42 in turn determines or calculates a corresponding<br>
motor/generator 40 speed or torque value required to produce a predetermined planetary<br>
gear set 22 output speed. As an example, if the engine 12 is running at 4,000 rpm and the<br>
accessories 38 are optimized to run at 1,500 rpm, the controller 42 calculates the speed of<br>
the motor/generator 40 required to produce a planetary gear set 22 output speed of 1,500<br>
rpm based upon the ring/sun tooth ratios of the planetary gear set 22. After completing<br>
the calculation, the controller 42 commands the motor/generator 40 to transfer the<br>
required amount of torque to the planetary gear set 22 such that the accessories 38 are<br>
driven in an optimally efficient manner.<br>
[0028]	The motor/generator 40 is also controllable to drive the accessories 38<br>
when the engine 12 is in an off state - the accessories 38 remain fully operational even<br>
when the hybrid vehicle 11 is being powered exclusively by an alternate power source<br>
(e.g., motor/generator 40) in order to conserve fuel. Advantageously, the motor/generator<br>
40 is also configured to re-start the engine 12 and power the accessories 38 when the<br>
engine 12 is being re-started such that there is no interruption of accessory 38 operation.<br>
More precisely, by controlling the motor/generator 40, output therefrom is transferable<br>
through the planetary gear set 22 to the accessories 38 such that the accessories 38 remain<br>
powered, and to the engine 12 such that the engine 12 is driven. As the engine 12 is<br>
being driven by the motor/generator 40, the controller 42 can introduce an engine spark<br>
(not shown) to re-start the engine 12.<br>
[0029]	A clutch is operatively connected between a stationary member 48, such<br>
as the motor/generator housing, a chassis frame, or the vehicle body, and either the crank<br>
pulley 14, the accessory drive input pulley 20, or a member of the planetary gear set 22.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the clutch is an over-<br>
running one-way clutch 44. It should be appreciated, however, that over-running one-<br>
way clutches are merely a preferred embodiment and that alternate clutch configurations<br>
may be implemented for the clutch as well. For example, according to an alternate<br>
embodiment, the one-way clutch 44 may be replaced with a selectively engageable brake<br>
(not shown.)<br>
[0030]	The one-way clutch 44 is implemented to allow the planetary gear set 22,<br>
preferably planet carrier assembly 30, to rotate at a predetermined ratio of engine speed<br>
during engine-on operation, and to allow the motor/generator 40 to efficiently power the<br>
accessories 38 when the engine 12 is off. It should be appreciated that without the one-<br>
way clutch 44, the motor/generator 40 could transfer at least a portion of its output torque<br>
back to the engine 12 when the engine 12 is off, and that the torque transferred back to<br>
the engine 12 could cause the engine to rotate backwards. Therefore, the one-way clutch<br>
44 prevents the transfer of torque from the motor/generator 40 back to the engine 12, and<br>
provides the reaction torque necessary to enable the motor/generator 40 to efficiently run<br>
the accessories 38.<br>
[0031]	Still referring to Fig. 1, a breakaway clutch 50 is disposed between the<br>
one-way clutch 44 and the stationary member 48. Ideally, the breakaway clutch 50 is<br>
positioned in series torque transmitting relation to the one-way clutch 44 (as best seen in<br>
Fig. 2). There may be circumstances in which the engine crankshaft 16 rotates in a<br>
direction opposite of the normal operational direction of rotation - e.g., during an engine<br>
shutdown operation. In addition, there may be circumstances during transient operating<br>
conditions in which there is a sudden increase in torque input to the accessory drive system<br>
10, also referred to in the art as a "load spike". The addition of the breakaway clutch 50 in<br>
series torque transmitting relation with the one-way clutch 44 mitigates the potentially<br>
adverse affects of these two scenarios - the breakaway clutch 50 being configured to act as<br>
a "fuse" or "filter" by disengaging the one-way clutch 44 from the stationary member 48,<br>
as will be described in detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0032]	An optional torque transmitting mechanism, preferably one-way clutch 53<br>
(depicted in phantom in Fig. 1) is disposed between two members of the planetary gear<br>
set 22. The one-way clutch 53 is intended to enable the engine 12 to operate the<br><br>
accessories 38 at higher speeds without the need for the motor/generator 40 to generate<br>
electric power, thus reducing the torque and power capacity requirement of the motor-<br>
generator 40 (i.e., allowing for a smaller, lighter, less expensive motor/generator<br>
assembly.) More specifically, the optional, one-way clutch 53 provides the means for<br>
causing the planetary gear set 22 to operate as a unit - all three members operating at the<br>
same rotational speed. In so doing, the accessory drive input pulley 20, and thus engine<br>
12, is connected directly to the accessory drive output pulley 32, thereby allowing the<br>
engine 12 to drive the accessories 38 directly without power from the motor/generator 40.<br>
[0033]	Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic, cross-sectional view of an accessory<br>
drive system, identified generally as 110, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention is provided. The accessory drive system 110 includes a first<br>
housing portion 112 that is preferably mounted to an engine (e.g., engine 12 of Fig. 1)<br>
and a torque transmission assembly 115, similar to the arrangement of Fig. 1. The first<br>
housing portion 112 encompasses a motor/generator assembly, indicated generally as<br>
140. The motor/generator assembly 140, preferably of the alternating current (AC) type<br>
that includes a motor/generator 116 having a stator 117 circumscribing an annular rotor<br>
119, operatively drives a motor/generator shaft 118.<br>
[0034]	The first housing portion 112 is operatively attached, e.g., via bolts 121, to<br>
a second housing portion 113. The second housing portion 113 encases a differential gear<br>
set, preferably in the nature of planetary gear set 122. Similar to the planetary gear set 22<br>
or Fig. 1, the planetary gear set 122 of Fig. 2 employs an outer gear member, typically<br>
designated as the ring gear 128. The ring gear member 128 circumscribes an inner gear<br>
member, typically designated as the sun gear 124. A carrier member, such as planet<br>
carrier assembly 130, rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 126 such that each of<br>
the planet gears 126 meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 128 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 124 of the planetary gear set 122. It should be understood that<br>
the planet carrier assembly 130 may be of the single-pinion type (as shown in Fig. 1) or<br>
the double-pinion type (not shown.)<br>
[0035]	Power output from the planetary gear set 122 is transferred to an accessory<br>
drive output pulley 132 via ring gear shaft 129. A second belt (not shown) thereafter<br>
couples the accessory drive output pulley 132 with one or more accessory pulleys (not<br><br>
shown), which are each operatively connected to respective one of the vehicle accessories<br>
(not shown.) Synonymous with the torque transfer apparatuses of Fig. 1, the various<br>
input and output pulleys and corresponding belts of Fig. 2 can be replaced by a<br>
connecting shaft, a belt and sprocket assembly, or intermeshing gears without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0036]	According to the preferred embodiment of Fig. 2, the motor/generator<br>
assembly 140 is configured to selectively operate as either a motor or a generator,<br>
functioning as described with respect to the motor generator 40 of Fig. 1. For example,<br>
the planetary gear set 122 is configured to convert the rotational speed of an accessory<br>
drive input pulley 120, which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed and is connected via<br>
shaft 127 with planet carrier assembly 130, to a predetermined value selected to<br>
efficiently drive a plurality of vehicle accessories, such as accessories 38 of Fig. 1. In<br>
other words, the magnitude of torque transmitted from the accessory drive input pulley<br>
120 to an accessory drive output pulley 132 is selectively increased or decreased by the<br>
planetary gear set 122 to more closely coincide with the actual power requirements of the<br>
accessories, thereby minimizing parasitic power losses. Thus, the motor/generator<br>
assembly 140 is controllable to drive the various vehicle accessories attached thereto at a<br>
predetermined rate regardless of engine speed, synonymous with the motor/generator 40<br>
of Fig. 1.<br>
[0037]	Still referring to Fig. 2, a first torque-transmitting mechanism is<br>
operatively connected to a member of the planetary gear set 122, namely planet carrier<br>
assembly 130, and the second housing portion 113 via a second torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism. According to the embodiment presented in Fig. 2, the first torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism is an over-running one-way clutch 144. However, the over-<br>
running one-way clutch 144 is merely a preferred embodiment, and substitute clutch<br>
configurations may be implemented as alternatives. For example, according to an<br>
alternate embodiment, the one-way clutch 144 may be replaced with a selectively<br>
engageable brake (not shown.)<br>
[0038]	The one-way clutch 144 has a plurality of one-way torque-transmitting<br>
members 145 disposed between an inner race 146 and an outer race 148, also referred to<br>
herein as the one-way clutch hub or housing. In the exemplar}' embodiment shown, the<br><br>
torque-transmitting members 145 are in the form of rollers, housed in a cage 147, which<br>
maintains their circumferential space between the inner race 146 and the outer race 148.<br>
The rollers 145 are configured to engage cam surfaces (not shown) on the inner and/or<br>
outer races 146, 148 when the inner race 146 rotates in a direction opposite of drive to<br>
thereby prevent relative rotation between the inner race 146 and the outer race 148 in that<br>
direction and freewheel in the direction of drive. In other words, assuming that the<br>
engine driven, accessory drive input pulley 120 rotates in the clockwise direction, the<br>
one-way clutch 144 will freewheel in the clockwise direction, and lock in the<br>
counterclockwise direction, thereby disallowing the carrier assembly 130 from rotating in<br>
the counterclockwise direction. The operation of one-way clutches is well understood by<br>
those skilled in the art. It should be understood that the torque-transmitting members 145<br>
may take on other configurations to transmit torque from the planetary gear set 122 and<br>
the transmission housing 113, e.g., a rocker clutch, sprag, mechanical diode, etc. (not<br>
shown herein.)<br>
[0039]	The one-way clutch 144 is implemented to allow the planet carrier<br>
assembly 130 to rotate, preferably in the clockwise direction, at a predetermined ratio of<br>
the engine speed during engine-on operation, to freewheel in the counterclockwise<br>
direction, and to allow the motor/generator assembly 140 to efficiently power the vehicle<br>
accessories when the engine is off. Similar to the embodiment of Fig. 1, the one-way<br>
clutch 144 prevents the transfer of torque from the motor/generator assembly 140 back to<br>
the vehicle engine (e.g., engine 12, Fig. 1) and provides the reaction torque necessary to<br>
enable the motor/generator assembly 140 to efficiently run the vehicle accessories (e.g.,<br>
accessories 38, Fig. 1.).<br>
[0040]	Referring again to Fig. 2, a second torque transmitting device, specifically<br>
one-way clutch 153, is mounted concentrically with the shaft 127, radially disposed<br>
between the ring gear shaft 129 and the planet carrier assembly 130. As is readily known<br>
by those having ordinary skill in the art, if two members of a simple planetary gear set<br>
rotate in the same direction and at the same speed, the third member of the gear set is<br>
forced to turn at the same speed and in the same direction. Most relevant to the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 2, if the ring gear 128 and planet carrier assembly 130 are forced to<br>
rotate in the same direction and at the same speed, e.g., by actuating the one-way clutch<br><br>
153, the entire planetary gear set 122 is locked together to effect what is known as direct<br>
drive - the single-pinion carrier 130 rotates in unison with the sun and ring gears, 124,<br>
128. In so doing, the accessory drive input pulley 120 is connected directly to the<br>
accessory drive output pulley 132, thereby allowing the engine to transmit power directly<br>
to the accessories without power input from the motor/generator 116.<br>
[0041]	A third torque-transmitting mechanism, specifically the breakaway clutch<br>
shown generally in Fig. 2 at 150, is disposed between the one-way clutch 144 and the<br>
second housing portion 113, acting as a stationary member. The breakaway clutch 150 is<br>
positioned in series torque transmitting relation with the one-way clutch 144. The<br>
breakaway clutch 150 includes a clutch pack, defined herein by a plurality of friction<br>
plates or linings 154 interposed between an apply plate 152 and a plurality of clutch<br>
reaction plates 156, as depicted in Fig. 2. The apply plate 152 and reaction plates 156 are<br>
operatively connected to the second housing portion 113 via a housing extension 158<br>
through splines 160 and 162, respectively. The friction plates 154 are operatively<br>
connected with a spline connection 166 of the outer race 148 of the one-way clutch 144<br>
through splines 168.<br>
[0042]	A biasing member, preferably in the nature of Belleville spring 170, is<br>
preferably co-axially disposed, e.g., along axis of rotation A, with respect to the clutch<br>
pack. The Belleville spring 170 has an outer portion 172, which is positioned within the<br>
second housing portion 113 by a snap ring 174. The Belleville spring 170 is pressed or<br>
abutted against the apply plate 152 to provide a constant load on the clutch pack - apply<br>
plate 152, friction plates 154, and clutch reaction plates 156 - thereby frictionally engaging<br>
or connecting the clutch pack plates and, in so doing, grounding the one-way clutch<br>
housing 148 to the second housing portion housing 113. It should be recognized that the<br>
breakaway clutch 150 can be replaced with a breakaway band equipped with a spring servo<br>
(not shown) without departing from the intended scope of the present invention.<br>
[0043]	Ideally, the spring 170 is selectively preloaded (e.g., pre-compressed) to<br>
provide a predetermined torque capacity or threshold, after which the breakaway clutch<br>
150 will begin to slip - i.e., friction plates 154 will begin to frictionally disengage from<br>
clutch reaction plates 156. It is in this regard that the breakaway clutch 150 acts as a<br>
"fuse" or "filter". Under circumstances wherein the engine crankshaft, and thus the input<br><br>
pulley 120, rotates in a direction opposite of the normal operational direction of rotation,<br>
e.g., causing the shaft 127 to rotate counterclockwise, the one-way clutch 144 could be<br>
damaged if it were grounded. The breakaway clutch 150 is configured to disengage the<br>
one-way clutch 144 from the second housing portion housing 113 when rotation of the<br>
shaft 127 in the counterclockwise direction causes reaction torque of the breakaway clutch<br>
150, as fed through the one-way clutch 144, to exceed the predetermined torque capacity,<br>
thus allowing the one-way clutch 144 to operate as a grounding device only when the<br>
engine crankshaft comes to a complete stop.<br>
[0044]	In addition, there may be circumstances during transient operating<br>
conditions when the motor/generator assembly 140 is driving the vehicle accessories via<br>
the planet carrier assembly 130 and there is a sudden load spike. Sudden changes in<br>
accessory load can potentially cause belt slippage or component failure. The addition of<br>
the breakaway clutch 150 in series with the one-way clutch 144 acts as a load filter by<br>
allowing slippage when the input of load is greater than a predetermined threshold value,<br>
thereby restricting the torque spike from being applied to the accessory drive output pulley<br>
132. In other words, the breakaway clutch 150 is optimally preloaded to provide a<br>
minimum torque carrying capacity sized to transmit the grounding torque required to<br>
transmit a maximum accessory load, while the maximum torque carrying capacity (or<br>
breakaway capacity) of the breakaway clutch 150 is sized to allow clutch slippage when<br>
subjected to a grounding torque which may result in belt slippage.<br>
[0045]	While the best modes for carrying out the present invention have been<br>
described in detail herein, those familiar with the art to which this invention pertains will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
