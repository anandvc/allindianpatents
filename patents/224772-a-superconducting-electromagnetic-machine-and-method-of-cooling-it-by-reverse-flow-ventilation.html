				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to superconducting synchronous elecltrical machines With a<br>
reverse flow ventilation system to cool the stator of the machine.<br>
In the process of producing electricity, power generators create heat that must be<br>
dissipated from the generator. Heat occurs in generators due primarily to windage<br>
and friction, electric current flow, and time-varying magnetic fields in magnetic<br>
structures. Frictional heating occurs as the rotor spins at high speed in the generator.<br>
Similarly, heating also occurs as current flows through the rotor and stator coils, as<br>
these coils rotate relative to one another in the magnetic fields of the generator.<br>
Losses in the magnetic circuit occur as the magnetic fields change with time in<br>
permeable materials, such as for example in the stator core and the rotor poles of a<br>
synchronous generator. Generators are conventionally equipped with cooling systems<br>
to transfer heat from the stator and rotor away from the generator<br>
Gas ventilation cooling systems have been used in conventional synchronous<br>
machines, such as generators and motors, that do not employ superconducting<br>
materials. These gas ventilation systems tightly couple the cooling of stator and rotor.<br>
The ventilation system cools both the rotor and stator by forcing cooling gas through<br>
gas passages in the rotor and stator. Conventional ventilation systems have employed<br>
forward flow and reverse flows of cooling gases through the stator and rotor.<br>
In conventional synchronous machines, such as synchronous generators and motors,<br>
the ventilation system of gas-cooled machines tightly couples the cooling of stator and<br>
rotor. In the forward flow ventilation scheme (Fig. 1) the cooling gas flows through<br>
sections of the rotor and stator in series which creates a tight coupling Between rotor<br>
and stator cooling systems. In the reverse flow ventilation scheme (Fig. 2) the cooling<br>
gas flows through stator and rotor in parallel, but then mixes in the machine air gap,<br>
also leading to a coupling of the stator and rotor cooling.<br>
Because of the coupling of the cooling of the rotor and stator, the ventilation system<br>
must be configured to provide adequate cooling for both the stator and rotor. To<br>
provide cooling for the rotor, some compromises may have to be made in a<br>
conventional ventilation system with respect to cooling the stator and vice versa. It<br>
may be difficult to optimize the cooling of either the stator or rotor with a ventilation<br>
system that must provide cooling for both the rotor and stator. Nevertheless,<br>
ventilation systems have conventionally provided cooling for both the stator and rotor<br>
in large industrial and utility power generators.<br>
In a superconducting synchronous machine the rotor field winding is operated at<br>
cryogenic temperatures through a cryorefrigeration system that has its own self-<br>
contained cooling circuit. A cold, cryogenic coolant is supplied to the rotor through a<br>
transfer coupling, from where it is circulated through a cooling circuit on the rotor<br>
where it picks up heat to be removed, and then returns to a stationary cooling system<br>
through the transfer coupling. This cryogenic cooling system provides effective<br>
cooling of the rotor in a superconducting machine.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cryogenic cooling system for a superconducting rotor does not cool the stator.<br>
The stator of such a superconducting synchronous machine requires a stator cooling<br>
system. Contrary to conventional machines where stator and rotor cooling systems<br>
are coupled in a single ventilation system, the cooling system of the cryogenic rotor<br>
and the gas-cooled stator may be completely independent. Thus, a stator cooling<br>
system is needed to cool the stator in a synchronous machine having a<br>
superconducting rotor.<br>
A stator ventilation system has been developed for a superconducting synchronous<br>
machine. The stator of a superconducting synchronous machine is cooled by a<br>
reverse ventilation system in which a cooling gas, such as air or hydrogen, is drawn<br>
from the air gap and pumped through a diffuser, heat exchanger and through the stator<br>
core back to the air gap. In addition, a conventional synehronous machine may. be<br>
retrofit with a superconducting rotor and a conventional ventilation system modified<br>
to embody the ventilation system disclosed here. An alternate stator ventilation<br>
configuration follows the principle of forward flow, in which the air flows through the<br>
stator in the opposite direction to the reverse flow stator cooling system.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is a synchronous machine comprising: a rotor<br>
coupled to a rotor cooling system; a stator around the rotor and separated from the<br>
rotor by an annular gap between the rotor and an inner surface of the stator, and a<br>
stator ventilation system separate and independent of the rotor cooling system.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a superconducting electromagnetic machine<br>
comprising: a solid core rotor having a cryogenically cooled superconducting rotor<br>
coil winding; a stator coaxial with said rotor and having stator coils magnetically<br>
coupled with said superconducting rotor coil winding, said stator coils arranged<br>
around said rotor, and said stator having cooling passages extending from an outer<br>
periphery of the stator to an inner periphery of the stator, said inner periphery<br>
separated from the rotor by an annular air gap; said rotor having cooling passages for<br>
cryogenic cooling fluid; a stator ventilation system providing cooling gas to said outer<br>
periphery of the stator and said passages of the stator.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention is a method for cooling a superconducting<br>
electromagnetic machine having a solid core rotor including a superconducting rotor<br>
coil winding and a stator and a stator ventilation system, said method comprising the<br>
steps of: cryogenically cooling the rotor coil winding independently of cooling the<br>
stator; cooling the stator with a cooling gas flowing through the stator, and drawing<br>
the cooling gas out of the stator into an air gap between the stator and rotor core,<br>
where the cooling gas is isolated from any rotor cooling system.<br>
The proposed stator cooling systems are independent of the type of superconducting<br>
rotor configurations, and can be equally applied to iron-core and air-core<br>
superconducting rotors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a conventional generator 8 having a conventional forward flow<br>
ventilation system 10, in which cooling gas (arrows 12) flows through the rotor 14,<br>
and/or rotor air gap 16, and then through the stator 18. The cooling gas flows through<br>
radial gas passages 20 in the rotor and similar radial gas passages 21 in the stator in<br>
series which creates a tight coupling between rotor and stator cooling systems.<br>
As the cooling gas flows through the rotor, heat in the rotor is transferred to the gas as<br>
the temperature of the gas rises towards the temperature of the rotor coils. The heated<br>
gas exiting the rotor and the cooling gas that directly entered the air gap 16 mix and<br>
become the cooling gases that enter the stator. The mixed cooling gases enter the<br>
stator passages 21 at an interior stator surface that surrounds the rotor. As the gases<br>
move through the stator, heat from the hot stator coils is transferred to the cooling<br>
gases and removed from the stator as when the gases exit the stator.<br>
From the outer periphery of the stator, the heated cooling gases pass through annular<br>
ducts 22 that surround the stator and direct the hot gases to the heat exchangers. The<br>
hot gases are cooled in heat exchangers 24, flow through recirculation ducts 26 and<br>
are pumped back into the rotor and air gap by an appropriate radial or axial fan 28.<br>
The cooling gases are also driven through the rotor and into the gap 16 by centrifugal<br>
forces in the rotor. In addition, some of the cooling gases exiting the fan 28 are<br>
directed to cool the end turns 30 of the stator coil windings.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates a conventional reverse flow ventilation system 32 in which<br>
cooling gas flows through stator 18 and rotor 14 in parallel. The heated cooling gas<br>
exits both the rotor and stator into the air gap 16. The mixing in the air gap of the<br>
cooling gases from the stator and rotor results in a coupling of the cooling systems for<br>
the rotor and stator.<br>
Reverse flow cooling in a conventional electrical machine 8 delivers cold gas (arrows<br>
12) simultaneously to both the stator 18 and the rotor 14 by providing parallel inlet<br>
paths to the stator core and the rotor entrance. Cold gas flows from a cooler, e.g., heat<br>
exchanger, into the outer periphery of the stator core, which may contain baffles to<br>
control the airflow through the stator core, and into the air gap. Cold gas also flows<br>
from the cooler into the ends of the rotor, and, generally through cooling gas sub-slots<br>
20 and radially outwardly through gas flow passages in the rotor slots 20, to the<br>
generator air gap 16. A fan 28 attached to the rotor circulates the exhaust gas from<br>
the air gap back to the cooler<br>
In particular, FIGURE 2 shows a cross section of a generator 8 having a conventional<br>
reverse flow ventilated cooling system 32. U.S. Patent No. 5,633,543 shows an<br>
exemplary reverse flow ventilation system. A portion of the flow of cooling gases<br>
(arrow 12) is drawn into the rotor by centrifugal forces acting on the gases passing<br>
through the rotor passages 20. The cooling gases may be air, hydrogen or some other<br>
cooling gas. The heated rotor gases exit the ducts at the surface of the rotor into the<br>
air gap 16 between the rotor and stator. A spinning fan 28 mounted at the end(s) of<br>
the rotor draws the heated gas from the gap 16 between the stator and rotor, and into<br>
an external duct diffuser 34 that directs the gases to a heat exchanger 36 that cools the<br>
gas.<br>
In a reverse flow system, the stator 18 is cooled by ventilation flow paths that are<br>
separate from the flow paths in the rotor. Gases cooled by the heat exchanger 36<br>
enters a plenum chamber 38 surrounding the stator. A portion (arrow 39) of the<br>
cooled gas from the heat exchanger is directed towards the rotor. A portion (arrows<br>
41) of the cooling gas is directed to cool the stator end turns.<br>
In the stator plenum chamber 38, the cooling gas passes through baffles 40 in the<br>
chamber (or directly to the stator near the center of the stator) and into cooling gas<br>
passages 21 that are open at the outer circumferential surface of the stator. As the gas<br>
flows radially inward through the stator, heat from the stator coils is transferred to the<br>
gas. The hot gas flows from the stator into the air gap. The rotor fans 28 draw the<br>
warmed gas from the air gap 16 and out to the external duct 34 to the heat exchanger<br>
36. The cooled gas from the heat exchanger is exhausted from exhaust ports to the<br>
plenum chamber 38 around the stator.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 50 having a stator 52<br>
and a rotor 54. While the machine 50 is shown as a generator, it may also be<br>
configured as an electric motor. In the generator, the rotor includes field winding coil<br>
66 that fit inside the cylindrical rotor cavity 56 of the stator. An annular gap 57 is<br>
formed between the outside periphery of the rotor and the cylindrical surface of the<br>
stator that defines a cylindrical cavity 56 which receives the rotor. As the rotor turns<br>
within the stator, a magnetic field generated by the rotor and rotor coils moves/rotates<br>
through the stator and creates an electrical current in the windings of the stator coils<br>
60. This current is output by the generator as electrical power<br>
The rotor 54 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 62 and a generally solid<br>
rotor core 64. The solid rotor core 64 has high magnetic permeability, and is usually<br>
made of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron. In a low power density<br>
superconducting machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the<br>
magnetomotive force (MMF), and, thus, minimize the amount of superconducting<br>
(SC) coil wire needed for the coil winding.<br>
The rotor 54 supports at least one longitudinally-extending, racetrack-shaped, high-<br>
temperature superconducting (HTS) coil winding 66. The HTS coil winding may be<br>
alternatively a saddle-shape or have some other shape that is suitable for a particular<br>
HTS rotor design. The HTS coil winding is cooled by cryogenic fluid supplied to the<br>
rotor by an outside source of cooling fluid. The cooling of the rotor and its HTS coils<br>
is independent of and isolated from cooling systems for other components of the<br>
generator 50, such as the stator 52.<br>
The rotor includes a collector end shaft 68 and a drive end shaft 70 that bracket the<br>
rotor core 64, which are supported by bearings 72. The end shafts may be coupled to<br>
external devices For example, the collector end shaft 68 has a cryogen transfer<br>
coupling 74 to a source 75 of cryogenic cooling fluid used to cool the SC coil<br>
windings in the rotor. An exemplary source of cryogenic cooling fluid is disclosed in<br>
commonly-owned and co-pending U.S. Patent No._____________(now U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 09/854,943, filed May 15, 2001, to the best of my knowledge,<br>
the following patents associated with cooling systems were filed by CRD: 17GE-7154<br>
- Cryogenic cooling system for rotor having a high temperature superconducting field<br>
winding - Laskaris. 17GE-7227 - Cryogenic cooling refrigeration system and method<br>
having open-loop short term cooling for a superconducting field winding - Wang,<br>
Laskaris, Ackermann. 17GE-7228 - Cryogenic cooling refrigeration system for rotor<br>
having a high temperature superconducting field winding and method - Laskaris,<br>
Ackermann, Wang) and entitled "Cryogenic Cooling Refrigeration System For Rotor<br>
Having A High Temperature Super-Conducting Field Winding And Method".<br>
The cryogen transfer coupling 74 includes a stationary segment coupled to a source of<br>
cryogen cooling fluid and a rotating segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS<br>
coil. The collector end shaft 68 also includes a collector 76 for electrically connecting<br>
to the rotating SC coil winding. The drive end shaft 70 of the rotor may be driven by<br>
a power turbine coupling 78.<br>
FIGURE 4 shows a cross-section of one-half of a generator 50 (see rotor axial center-<br>
line 62 and longitudinal center-line 80) having a reverse flow, ventilated stator<br>
cooling system 82. The cooling system provides cooling gas, e.g., ambient air or<br>
hydrogen, to the stator. The stator cooling system is independent of and isolated from<br>
the cryogenic cooling system that provides cryogen cooling fluid to the rotor.<br>
The stator ventilation system 82 includes a cooling gas fan 84 that is affixed to an<br>
end(s) shaft (68 and/or 70) of the rotor. The fan 84 spins with the rotor to draw<br>
heated cooling gas (arrows 86) from an annular air gap 88 between the rotor and<br>
stator. The hot gas drawn from the gap is pumped by the fan, through a gas passage<br>
89, and into an external gas duct plenum chamber/diffuser 90 that extends around<br>
stator of the generator.<br>
The plenum chamber duct 90 shows the high pressure/velocity gas from passage 89<br>
and directs the warmed gas to one or more heat exchangers 92. The heat exchangers<br>
extract heat from the gas and cools the gas so that it may be recirculated to cool the<br>
stator. Cooled gas from the heat exchanger enters a baffle chamber 94 surrounding<br>
the outer periphery of the stator. The baffle chamber may have an outer wall 93 that<br>
circumferentially surrounds the stator and has openings for the heat exchangers. The<br>
baffle chamber may include annular walls 96 attached to the stator, to distribute the<br>
cooling air to the stator. The baffle chamber directs cooled gas to the outer<br>
circumference 98 of the stator. The plenum chamber may include baffles that<br>
optimally distribute the flow of cooling gas over the stator and into the stator cooling<br>
passages 100. The outer walls of the plenum chamber may also include an exhaust<br>
port 102 that bleeds cooling gas 103 from the chamber to the end of the stator and<br>
over the end-turns 104 of the stator coils 106.<br>
Heat is extracted from the stator coils as the cooling gas passes through the stator<br>
cooling passages 100. TEe passages may be arranged in the stator to optimize the<br>
cooling of the stator coils. For example, the frequency of cooling passages along the<br>
stator axis and/or the cross-sectional area of the passages may be selected to evenly<br>
distribute cooling in the stator or to otherwise optimize stator cooling.<br>
The heated cooling gas flows from the stator passages 100 into the air gap 88. The<br>
cooling gas is drawn through the gap by the fan 84 and passage 82, where the cooling<br>
gas is then cooled by the heat exchanger 92 and recirculated back through the stator.<br>
The ventilation system 82 may be a closed gas system wherein cooling gas, e.g.,<br>
hydrogen or air, is circulated through the stator, heat exchanger and plenum to cool<br>
the stator.<br>
In a closed loop ventilation system 82 for a machine with a superconducting rotor, the<br>
cooling gas such as air or hydrogen is circulated from the heat exchangers) 92<br>
through the stator cooling passages 100 to extract heat from the stator coils, the air<br>
gap 88 to an axial fan 84, and back to the heat exchanger. The cold cooling gas,<br>
exiting from the heat exchangers, cools the stator core and stator winding. The space<br>
between stator end winding 104 and machine flange has one gas flow path 89 to duct<br>
the hot gas from the fan 84 to the heat exchangers. This one gas passage simplifies<br>
the complexity of the reverse flow ventilation system of conventional machines which<br>
have two flow paths (see Fig. 2 and passages 34 and 39).<br>
The stator cooling system is also applicable for synchronous machines where a<br>
conventional rotor is replaced with a superconducting rotor. In such a case, the<br>
forward or reverse flow ventilation system of the original machine may be converted<br>
to the reverse flow system shown in FIGURES 3, 4 or 5.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows an open-loop reverse flow ventilation system 108 in which cooling<br>
gases are drawn from an outside source, e.g., ambient air (arrows 110), and pass<br>
through as an input port 112. The cool inlet gas passes through the baffle chamber 94,<br>
stator passages 100, air gap 88 and the fan 84 in a manner similar to the flow of<br>
cooling gas in the closed ventilation system 82. The fan moves the heated air out<br>
from the air gap and provides the driving force to draw air through the ports 112 and<br>
through the stator. In an open loop system, air, is drawn into the machine through<br>
inlets and vented back to the environment through discharge ducts 114. Thus, heat<br>
exchangers and other passages are unnecessary in an open system.<br>
The ventilation systems shown in FIGURES 4 and 5 may be applied to polyphase<br>
alternating current (AC) machines with a superconducting (SC) rotor and a stator<br>
carrying polyphase AC winding(s).<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment, but on the<br>
contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements<br>
