				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel herbal nutraceutical. More particularly to novel herbal jams and jellies with proven pharmacological activities such as memory enhancer, antioxidant, anti-depressant, immuno-modulator, adapatogen, health promoter and chemically standardized on the basis of one or more bioactive constituents.<br>
Fruits and vegetables are among the most important foods of mankind as these are not only nutritive but are also sometimes indispensable for the maintenance of health. Preservation of fruits in one or the other form has been practiced in all parts of the world since time immemorial.<br>
Among the preserved fruits, jams, jellies, marmalades etc. form an important class of products. During World War II, fairly large quantities of these were imported into India from USA, UK and Australia. Now a day, such products are being manufactured extensively in this country, as by-products in fruit canning units. They are also made in homes all over the country.<br>
Lately, with regard to the invention and application of various chemicals in fresh fruits and food items, there is a increased concern about "green" technologies and products. It has led the public more interested in using medicines from natural sources. In addition to prescription drugs, there is also now great interest in food products, which in addition to providing nutrition, foster specific therapeutic effects. Until recently, biosciences regarded foods as chemically mundane, thus of little salience to disease process. During the earlier history of biomedicine, new products which combined pharmacological and dietetic treatments, were produced. Thus, the interest in the health potential of foods was renewed. This started a secular initiative from the advocates of holistic health" and from individuals from the health care system. By now the concept of health promoting foods is well established in the biomedical and nutrition sciences. This has resulted in growing of literature on "functional foods" and nutraceuticals. The term functional food is used to describe foods with added ingredients, being capable to producing certain health benefits. The term nutraceutical is used to describe a food or food component considered to provide medicinal and / or health benefits. These foods assist in the prevention or<br><br>
treatment of disease. [ Debrovner, D (1992), American Druggist, 295, 36-40; Goldbug, I (1994) in "Functional foods, designer foods, pharma foods, nutraceuticals. Chapman and Hall, New York 544 PP; anonymous (1995) Journal of American Dietetic Association, 95, 493-496; Johns, T and Romeo, J.T. (1998) in "Functionality of food phytochemicals, Plenum press, New York, 261 pp]. According to Richard Firshein D.O. an expert in nutritional research and medicine, many of the ailments, prevalent today including fatigue, asthma, diabetes and cancer can be prevented or treated with nutraceuticals. Intense research efforts are under way to develop marketable products. There is a strong interest among European consumers in foods claiming health benefits. There are differences in the health claims that interest people in different European countries. The U.K. places great emphasis on claims related to heart disease and the German consumer is more interested in claims relating to general disease resistance. Nearly all-multinational food producers have such products in their line of goods or in development. These products are enriched with dietary fiber (57%), calcium (36%), vitamin C (35%) vitamin E (22%), iron (3%) and magnesium (3%).<br>
There are some herbal food supplements available in the developed nations and a few in the developing ones. These include herbal teas, vitacel, pastas, diabetic foods and chyavanprash etc.<br>
Herbal jam referred in the literature is strictly prepared as per the Charaka Samhita and is known as chyavanprash. This is known for its rejuvenative and health promotion effects. Other herbal jams cited in the literature contain powdered herbs such as Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Tinospora cordifolia, Viola odorata, Echinacea angustifolia, Ocimum sanctum etc.<br>
Therefore, the products available in the market have following disadvantages.<br>
1.        Most of Herbal Jams/Jellies available in the market are Jams incorporated with<br>
spices i.e., Ginger Jam, spicy blue berry jam, Grapefruit Jelly, Garlic jelly etc.<br>
their main emphasis is on taste health benefits..<br>
2.	Herbal teas are not familiar to the common people and the products are not<br>
available in the developing countries. These are more often rejected on the basis<br>
of undesired taste.<br>
3.	The Chyavanprash a food-supplement for strength and energy is used only as a<br>
casual food supplement.<br>
4.	The jams containing herbs do not contain standardized herbs based on genuine<br>
markers present in them.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel herbal nutraceutical and more particularly to novel herbal jams and jellies with proven pharmacological activities such as memory enhancer, antioxidant, anti-depressant, immuno-modulator, adapatogen, health promoter and chemically standardized on the basis of one or more bioactive constituents.<br>

Finally, the product mixed with erythrosine (0.008 gm) and 0.1 ml essence (Mixture of rose oil and gerinol 1:3) and packed the final product (200 gm) in sterilized container. The product showed 29.43% increase in survival time under hypoxia, whereas increase in swimming performance 37.29% and anti fatigue 30.0% was observed.<br>
Example-8: Centella asiatica (aerial parts 7.6 gm) after washing shade drying and powdering (350 mesh) mixed with 45gms of fresh mango pulp and 140 gm of powdered sugar. The mixed material boiled for five minutes on a heater and added to it high methoxyl pectin (2.6 gm). The mixture further boiled by stirring till it attains the concentration of approximately 65° Brix. To the contents than added 1.3 gm of citric acid by mixing and continued boiling up to 68.5° Brix. To the product finally added essence (alphanso mango flavor) 0.01 gm. and packed the green natural colored final product (200 gm) while hot in sterilized container. The product exhibited anti stress activity as observed by increase in survival time under hypoxia (34.78%), swimming performance (27.37) and anti fatigue after 30 minutes of the stress (40.0%)<br>
The main advantages of the present process are:<br>
1.	Production of a product preferably jams or jellies which can be used by all age<br>
groups to revitalize both body and mind and provide both medicinal and health<br>
