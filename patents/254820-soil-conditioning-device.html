SOIL CONDITIONING DEVICE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This international patent application claims priority to and benefit from, currently pending, U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 11/176,569, filed on 07 July 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to soil conservation, more specifically toward an apparatus for conditioning surface soils thereby increasing infiltration.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Traditional ferming comprises tasks sucli as plowing, disking, harrowing, seeding, fertilizing, and harvesting. During this farming process, soil is often left in a loose condition where the soil is subject to moisture evaporation and erosion. There is an increased demand to accomplish these farming tasks in a manner to conserve the soil by reducing erosion and to conserve the water by increasing the infiltration capability of the soil. Additionally, there is a demand to multitask these operations such liiat several tasks can be accomplished in a single pass over the land thus improving the efficiency of the farming operation and reducing costs. Due to the increasing demand for soil and water conservation as well as multitasking in farming and land management practices, it has become necessary to design machinery and supporting systems.<br><br>
Traditionally, soil erosion and surface water management has been attempted with dikmg, imprinting and campacting systems, and reservoir tillage systems. These systems have been designed for the purpose of sealing the soil surfece and/or retaining water where it fells thus reducing erosion. There are many forms of equipment available today Ihat attempt to create irrigation pools and reservoirs in the soil surface. Examples of processes which use equipment to compact the soil into pools include furrow irrigation, diking, compacting and punching, spading and scooping, imprinting and impressmg. All of these processes incorporate devices that can be mechanically driven or ground driven and can be linear or rotary in their operation. However, these traditional processes and associated devices fall short of providing a system or device which reduces erosion, reduces water runoff increases water iufiltration, and allows multitaskmg.<br>
Imprinting and compacting devices compact the soil to overcome erosion by creating pools. These devices require excessive weight to be applied perpendicular to the soil surfece, allowing the soil structure to be impressed in order to make their imprints. An example of an imprinting machine is the Dixon Wheel RollerTM which is designed to have flie required wieight to overcome the soils surfece structure in order to make an inipression. As a result of the compaction, the soil surface is sealed which causes the soil surfece to become substantially iinpervious to water infiltration.<br>
Compaction in soil is the dnect result of weight applied to the soil surface. Compaction occurs quite frequently on farmland because of the type of equipment used, such as a moldboard plow or imprinting and compacting devices. Further compaction is caused by high traffic, tractors, carts, etc. on the soil surface. This compacted soil surfece is commonly Icnown as hard pan. When weight is applied to the soil, the soil structure is compressed. The greats the weight or load to the soil.<br><br>
the greater the amount of compaction Compaction causes the surface soil to become compressed to such a level that it becomes substantially sealed and impervions to water. The top soil below the compactted surface soil is consequently substantially sealed off and has little water for  infiltration.This in turn leads to a reduction in replenishing of water in the underlying aquifer which has contributed to the current water supply problems. Additionally, farmers need use equipment such as Rippers'^, SnbSoilers'^, Cft Pan Busters'"* to penetrate below the hard pan and fracture it to allow moisture to infiltrate and  therefbre promote root systems on the crops. This practice does little to provide a systssn which reduces water runoff, increase water infiltration, or allow multitasking.<br>
More recently, imprinting type machines have been designed to require less weight to make an impression in the soil surface in an effort to overcome some of the associated problems. Even though these more recently designed machines are lighter than the Dixon Wheel/TM and other similar devices, they are all still relatively heavy and decrease water infiltration capabilities of the soil.<br>
Soil diking systems and devices have been designed to overcome some of the problems associated with the imprinting and compacting systems. Diking is accomplished by scooping, digging, and/or dragging the soil which is then left in a loose condition to form pools or reservoirs. Less weight is needed for diking than imprinting or compacting devices in an attempt to leave the soil surface more pervious to water. However, when water is applied to the loose soil it impacts and dislodges the fine particles of soil and organic matter on the sides of the dikes and washes them into the bottran of the pools. These particles of soil then seal the bottom of the pools which reduces the infiltration capability of the soil and diminishes the<br><br>
reduction of nmoff. Additionally, the loose soil is eroded from the field in both light and heavy rainfall events.<br>
Another recent attempt to provide soil and water conservation in farming has been the practice of no-till farming. No-tiIl farming is where the soil is left undisturbed from harvesting to plantmg. Planting is accomplished in a narrow seedbed or slot created by disc openers. Coulters, residue managers, seed firmers. and modified closing wheels are used on the planter to provide adequate seed to soil contact. However, there are several disadvantages associated with no-tili No-till requires the use of heibicides to eliminate competition from weeds which raises production costs. Crop residue left on the soil hinders soil warming and drying making planting more difficult and reduces seed germination. Conventional tillage systems cannot be used to incorporate fertilizers and herbicides. The heavy residue or foliage left on the land may result in poor seed soil contact thus reducing seed germination. Also, the soil surface is not left in a highly permeable state resulting in rain water runoff reduced infiltration to subsurface soils and the underlying aquifer.<br>
Most recenfly, reservoir tillage systems such as the one taught in U.S. Patent 5,628,372 ('372) have been devised to overcome the problems associated with the aforementioned farming practices. '372 teaches an agricultural instrument having a series of multifaceted peripheral ridge members having flat leading and trailing edges selectively spaced circumscribing a disc. The ridge members have a fiat circumferential section spacing therebetween. The configuration of the '372 device compacts the soil to form water retaining pools in the soil from the vertical impact of the ridge member on the soil upon rotation. This compaction reduces water infiltration into the soil. Additionally, the fiat trailing edge of the multifacated<br><br>
peripheral ridge member pitches the soil at rotation velocities necessary for efficient farming practices. This pitcfaing of the soil fills in the created pools with fine particles that seal the bottom of the pools which ferther reduces the infiltration capability of the soil. Furthermore, pitching of the soil destroys a portion of the structure of the pool leading to early failure of the remaiining pool structure.<br>
There remains a need for improving soil and water conservation as well as providing for efficient farmning practices, such as multitasking, and land management practices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is comprised of a soil conditiomng device having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members optionally joined by sub-ridge members circumscribing a disc, wheel or drum. When the soil conditioning device is rolled across the soil surface, a series of consolidated prow shaped hollows and optional weir formations are created in the soil enhancing soil permeability and reducing water runoff. Rolling of the soil conditioning device across the soil surface may be accomplished with a mechanized, human, or animal powered apparatus. The soil conditioning device may serve as the wheels for the apparatus rolling Ihe soil conditioning device or passively pulled with the apparatus. Preferably a transport means such as a tractor will pull a cylindrical rolling tool having a plurality of soil conditioning devices mounted thereon, The primary purpose of the soil conditioning device is enabling the soil to retain rain water where it fells and consequently reduce erosion and increase water retention and infiltration of the soil and provide for multitasking capabilities.<br>
The soil conditionong device is a rotary device which can be attached to most any existmg agricultural and horticultural machine and may also be attached to any<br><br>
specially designed machine for use in construction, mining or other situations which require earflaworks, including home gardening. Additionally, the soil conditiozung device may be fitted to an animal or human powered device such as a tri-wheeled vehicle having soil conditioning devices serving as wheels. Several soil conditioning devices may be adjacently aligned to form a soil conditioning tool in the form of a cylindrical roller having a plurality of soil conditioning devices. The device or tool is driven or rolled while being in contact with the ground forming a series of prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs. Additionally, the soil conditioning device or tool can be fitted with a ratchet release, break or clutch device, or can be driven mechanically fix&gt;m a variety of sources at speeds necessary for multitasking.<br>
The soil conditioing device is comprised of a relatively lightweight material. Such materials may include wood, polyurethane foam, rubber, silicon rubber, synthetic rubber, Hytre]TM, urethaane, various plastics or polymeric materials, and combinations thereof Preferably, the soil conditioning device is manufactured fi-om plastic or polymeric materials such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride, vinyl, or other such moldable plastic materials. HDPE has been found to be advantageous since it is a material which is light weight, strong, flexible and exhibits self cleaning capabilities when applied to the soil. Optionally, the use of UV-stabilizers such as carbon black may be added to improve its weather resistance. Combinations of various polymeric materials have also exhibited the desired properties of being relatively lightweight and a having a degree of flexibility.<br>
The soil conditioning device is molded producing a circular outer skin having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members optionally joined by sub-ridge members surrounding a hollow core. This design and material of manufacture allows the shape, hardness, and weight to be adjusted at its point of use by a farmer or other<br><br>
user for various soil types. This adjustabilily enables it to work efficiently in a variety of conditions. The adjustment is accomplished by filling fee hollow core through a valve in the soil conditianing device. The core may be filled with compressed air or other gases, water or other liquids, gels, solids, expanding foam, a mixture of air and water, or any combination thereof to obtain the desired shape, hardness, and/or weight.<br>
The soil conditioning device molds or consolidates fee soil upon which it is rolled or driven upon by applying light pressure to fee soil surface in a substantially horizontal direction so as to lighfly consolidate or bind fee outermost surface of fee soil together. Consolidating fee soil surface lightly sticks fee outermost surface soil particles togefeer leaving a porous permeable soil surface for greater infiltration capabilities. As fee device travels through fee soil, fee soil flows over and around fee various component surfaces of fee device restructuring fee soil to a desired form. While fee soil flows over and around fee various surfaces, the soil is caused to lift and flow in a bow wave fashion behind fee device or tool having a plurality of devices. While fee soil is in fee flowing state, fee device is rotating wifein fee soil flow and forming, ushering, and gently kneadmg fee soil while ushering it into place producing a series of consolidated hollows and optional weirs, therfore leaving fee soil surface in a "Geometric Ordered Roughness (GOR), necessary for fee control of erosion caused by water and wind, in a process known as "Hydroforming".  This process of consolidating the soil requires little or no additional pressure or force perpendicular to fee soil surface thus providing little or no compaction to fee surface soil. The consolidation is accomplished in a substantially lateral direction and shapes a structure in fee soil consisting of various curves and angles forming prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs which increases fee soil surface area. The<br><br>
increase in permeability and surface area of the soil surface both contribute to the increase in soil infiltration and consequent reduction in erosion. Additionally, the prow shape of the ridge allows for the device to be operated at speeds necessary for efficient farm practices.<br>
The soil conditioning device of the present invention consolidates the soil surface into a series of permeability or porous prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs controlling water flow and increasing the surface  area of the soil contacting rain water thus increasing the effective infiltration rate of the soil. These prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs are designed to slow and/or slop flowing water while allowing it to infiltrate the soil. These stmctures are consolidated evenly over their entire surfece of the soil increasing the surfece area of the soil and increasing the infiltraticn rate of the soil. Additionally, increase surfece area increases soil warming from the sun allowing for improved seed germination. Below this molded or consolidated surface, the soil structure remains loose thus allowing water to percolate throughout the soil. These prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs increased porosity, infiltration rate, and water absorbing capability of the soil directly reducing erosion of the soil by substantially eliminating and/or slowmg water runoff. Additionally, surfece ponding on fields is reduced since rainfall or irrigation water is more easily absorbed by the soil having a higher porosity and surfece area in contact with the water..<br>
The soil conditiomng device has many applications and benefits. It is capable of working on most all soil types and agricultural applications, such as planting, surfece water control, soil warming, reducing wind erosion, cultivating and plowing, or common construction applications, such as scaraping, building berms, reclaiming land, or even casating meridians between interstate highways.<br><br>

DETAIED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 shows soil conditioning device 100 having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members 104 joiaed by sub-ridge members 110 circumscribing wheel or disc 102. Each of the plurality of ridge member 104 has a leading prow shaped surface 106 and a trailing prow shaped surface 108. Sparming between each leading surface 106 and trailing surface 108 is a subridge member 110. This embodiment of the soil conditioning device may also be described as a wheel member 102 having a central continuous outer peripheral ridge of varying heights about wheel member's 102 circumference. The peripheral ridge is formed by prow shaped peripheral ridge members 104 having leading prow shaped surface 106 and trailing prow shaped surface 108. Ridge members 104 are joined or interposed by sub-ridge members 110 and have a rounded top surface and side walls 114 and 116 sloping toward wheel member 102.<br>
Soil conditioning device 100 is shown circumscribing wheel 102 and being of a unitary material having a hollow interior. Preferbly, soil conditioning device 100 is formed wife a polymeric material. More preferably, the polymeric material forming Ihe soil conditioning device of fee present invention is high density polyethylene. Optionally, a UV-stabilizer such as carbon black may be added to fee polymeric material to improve its weather resistance.<br>
Valve 112 is shown is shown in a sloping sidewall 114 of ridge member 104 and provides njection access to the inner core of device 100.   Compressed air or other gases, liquids, gels, solids, or any combination thereof may be injected into the<br><br>
inner core through valve 112 to obtain a desired shape, hardness, and/or weight of device 100.<br>
Rolling or driving soil conditioning device 100 upon the soil surface creates a permeable soil surface having a series of weixs and an increased surface area improving infiltration and controlling water flow thereupon. Tbe soil surfece is consolidated improving resistance to movement of soil particles by moving water while increasing permeability thus increasing infiltration capability of the soil. The weirs slow and direct the flow of water upon the soil sur&amp;ce, resulting in a cascading effect. This cascading effect reduces the inertia of the flowing water minimizing the soil's erosion. These soil structures increase the soil surfece area and decrease water run-off.<br>
Figure 2 shows soil conditioning device 200 having a plurality of prow shaped peripheral ridge members 204 selectively spaced about a peripheral surface of disc or wheel or disc 202. Each of the plurality of ridge members 204 has a leading prow shaped surface 206 and a trailing prow shaped surfece 208. Soil conditioning device 200 may also be described as wheel member 202 having a series of central disjointed outer peripheral ridge members 204 wherein each peripheral ridge member 204 has a prow shaped leading end 206, a prow shaped trailing end 208, and two opposing sloping sidewalk 214 and 216 sloping toward wheel 202,<br>
Soil conditioning device 200 is shown circumscribing wheel 202 and being of a unitary material having a hollow mterior. Optional valve 212 is shown in wheel 202 providing material access to the core of device 200. Rolling soil conditioning device 200 upon the soil sur&amp;ce consolidates the sur&amp;ce soil laterally into a series of preselectively spaced prow shaped hollows.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows soil conditioning device 100 of Fig. 1 having prow shaped ridge members or sections 104 interposed with subridge members or sections 110 circumscribing wheel or disc 102.

Preferably, bz exceeds h1 in arange of approximately 1,5 inches to 5 inches. Also in this embodiment, each ridge section 104 has aprimary height h2 extending continuously about the circumference of wheel 102 (1) in a range of about 5 inches to 10 inches.<br>
Figure 4 shows a front view of soil conditioning device 100 with prow shaped ridge members 104 and subridge members 110 circumscribing wheel 102.   Shown here are opposiog side walls 114 and 116 of ridge member or section 104 having an angle a therebetween. Preferably angle a is in a range of approximately 40° to 80°, and more preferably is approximately 60°.<br>
Figure 5 shows soil conditioning tool 500 incorporating a plurality of the soil conditioning devices 100. Soil conditiomng devices 100 are axially aligned and retained forming cylindrical rolling tool 500. hi the embodiment shown, soil conditioning devices 100 are adjacent one another in a staggered ridge member 104 alignment. However, soil conditioning devices 100 may be in a spaced configuration on cylindrical roller 510 and may as well be in a configuration having ridge members 104 aligned radially about cylindrical roller 510. Attaching hubs 512 extend axially from each end of cylindrical roller 510 for rotatingly attaching to a transport means such as a tractor or as the last device in a multitasking train of farming tools, or optionally placed hi various positions within the train of forming tools, providing for<br><br>
an efficient method of soil and water conservation easily incorporated into cnrrent farming practices.<br>
Figure 6 shows a top view of soil conditioning tool 600 incorposrating a plurality of the soil conditioning devices 100 of Fig. 1 for use after planting. Soil conditioning devices 100 are axially aligned, spaced, and retained forming cylindrical rolling tool 600. A plurality of pairs of soil conditioning devices 100 are adjacent one another in a staggered ridge member 104 alignment on cylindrical roller 602, However, soil conditioning devices 100 may be spaced having three, four or even more soil conditioning devices 100 adjacently aligned and the spacing between adjacent devices 100 may vary depending upon the size of the plants. Cylindrical roller 602 may be in a configuration having ridge members 104 aligned radially about cylindrical roller 602. Attaching arm 604 extends radially from a center portion of cylindrical roller 602 for rotatingly attaching to a transport means such as a tractor or as the last device in a multitasking train of farming tools.<br>
Figure 7 shows a top view of soil imprint 700 formed by soil conditioning tool 500 of Fig. 5 or other device having at least one soil conditioning device incorporated therein. Having soil conditioning tool 500 driven (Le. used as a powered wheel) or rolled (i.e. passively pulled or pushed) by mechanical, animal or human power upon the surface soil while being in contact with the ground consolidates the soil into a series of prow shaped hollows 704 and adjoining weirs 702. Leading end 708, midsection 710, and trailing end 706 make up hollow 704 and are formed by sections or walls 106,114,116, and 108 of device 100 respectively.<br>
Figure 8 shows a cross-sectional view of soil being conditioned by soil conditioning device 100 of Fig. 1. Shown here are force vectors 800 primarily in a lateral direction consolidating the soil surface. As device 100 rolls upon the land.<br><br>
leading prow shaped surface 106 makes contact with the soil and as device 100 continues to roll, leading prow surface 106 and ridge member 104 laterally consolidates the soil as shown by force vectoxs 700. Having prow shaped leading edge 106 first contacting the soil allows the soil to be consolidated with less than about fift pounds force per ridge member 104. Additionallya having trailing surfece 108 in a prow shape allows device 100 to move about the soil surfece at speeds of up to about 14 mph wihtout throwing or pitching the soil.<br>
Fig. 8a showB a plan view of the soil having been conditioned by soil conditioning device 200 of Fig. 2. Shown here are force vectors 812 indicating the lateral direction of consolidation and primarily showing the forward and rearward direction of consolidation achieved by the prow shaped ridge members 204 forming a series of prow shaped hollows 804. Prow shaped hollows 804 have leading end 808&gt; mid-section 810, and trailing end 806 and are formed by sections or walls 206, 214, 216, and 208 of device 200 respectively.<br>
Figures 9 and 9a show a cross-sectional view of soil conditioning device lOO in an expanded state and a retracted state respectively. Having soil conditionng tool 100 comprised of a flexible material such as a polymeric material and formed having a hollow center or cavity allows ridge member 104 to retract when device 100 encounters a radial forces as is likely when device 100 encounters a rock or other hard material within the surfece soil. The force required to retract ridge member 104 within device 100 may be adjusted by filling core 900 of device 100 with compressed air or other gases, liquids, gels, solids, or any combination thereof to obtain a desired hardness. This retractability of ridge member 104 provides that a substantially consisttent horizontal force within the surface soil is provided, hence uniform<br><br>
consolidation is achieved. A retraction of l1 less l2 is possible wifeout substantially altering fee configuration of ridge members 104.<br>
The present invention is a soil conditioning device having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members optionally joined by sub-ridge members circumscribing a disc, wheel or drum and a metjod for seating a permeable soil surface. The prow shape peripheral ridge members consolidate fee soil in varying degrees from fee top of fee impression to fee bottom of the impression which increases water infiltrarion and reduces soil erosion. At fee top of fee impression fee soil is at a greater risk of erosion by surfece water run-off, feerefore fee sofl is consolidated to a greater degree. At fee bottom of fee impression fee risk of erosion is considerable reduced and as a maximum infiltration rate is required to absorb fee accumulating water, fee soil is consolidated to fee minimum to enable fee soil to stay in place, allowing maximum percolation of fee accumulating water by interstitial flow. When fee soil conditioning device is moved on fee land fee prow shaped ridge member enters fee soil sweeping fee soil sideways so as to consolidate fee soil laterally. This is in contrast to compacting fee soil as is the case in more traditional devices. Furfeermore, as fee device leaves fee soil, this sideways sweeping action consolidates fee soil laterally at fee front of fee impression leaving fee impression in a stable condition stmcturally and allowing for fee maximum water infiltration and percolation. This is in contrast wife fee more traditional systems where fee soil is left loose and highly errodable as fee devices exit fee soil<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
