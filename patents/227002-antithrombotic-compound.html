THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS<br>
The invention relates to new therapeutic compounds, in particular to antithrombotic agents, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds as active ingredients, as well as the use of said compounds for the manufacture of medicaments.<br>
In therapy, a multiplicity of active compounds is used for the treatment and prophylaxis of all sorts of diseases. Drugs differ widely in their pharmacodynamic effects and clinical application, in penetrance, absorption and usual route of administration, in distribution among the body tissues and in disposition and mode of action.<br>
Apart from the type of patient and the type of disease to be treated or to be prevented, the physicochemical properties of therapeutically active compounds determine to a great extent the preferred route of their admistration. In the development of drugs, the oral applicability thereof is usually an important selection criterium. For the majority of patients this is obviously the most convenient route for access of the drug to the systemic circulation. In order for a drug -administered via oral route - to act, it must first be absorbed before it is transported to the appropriate tissue or organ, where it may penetrate to the responding subcellular structure and may subsequently be metabolized, or where it may be bound, stored, or whatever is necessary to elicit a response or to alter ongoing processes. However, not always compounds which have been found to possess an advantageous therapeutic activity are also sufficiently absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract to display effective oral bioavailability.<br>
Thus, one of the pivotal issues in drug design is to develop compounds which both show activity and good absorptive properties. An important area in which is actively sought for oral biavailability is the area of antithrombotic agents.<br>
The present invention relates to antithrombotic compounds comprising the group Q, Q having the formula<br><br><br>
The group Q is bound to the molecule through an oxygen atom or an optionally substituted<br>
nitrogen or carbon atom. "Optionally substituted" in this respect means any suitable substituent,<br>
such as, but not limited to, oxo, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, aryl, halogen and the like.<br>
The term "prodrug" means a compound of the invention in which (an) amino group(s) is (are)<br>
protected, e.g. by (a) hydroxy or (l-6C)alkoxycarbonyl group(s), or a compound wherein -if<br>
present- (a) carboxylate group(s) is (are) esterified.<br>
The present invention relates to the surprising finding that the presence of the group Q in<br>
antithrombotic compounds gives rise to favourable properties of the compounds. Especially<br><br>
when Q is used to replace a basic moiety in compounds of which is known that they require such a moiety for their activity, an improvement of the pharmacological properties is realized, and in particular when that basic moiety is a (hetero)arylguanidino or (hetero)arylamidino moiety. In particular an improvement of the absorptive properties of those compounds is observed. Also a reduction of the toxicity of compounds of this invention is observed.<br><br>
An established in vitro model for the determination of the absorptive properties of drugs is the Caco-2 model (Artursson, P., S.T.P. Pharma Sciences 3(1), 5-10, 1993; Walter, E. et al. Pharmaceutical Research, 3, 360-365, 1995). In this in vitro model the transepithelial transport properties of a compound are determined in monolayers of a human intestinal cell-line (Caco-2) in terms of a permeability coefficient (apparent permeability). This model is useful for the prediction of in vivo absorption of compounds in the gastrointestinal tract. Preferably the antithrombotic compounds of the invention have a Caco-2 permeability of 8 nm/s or higher.<br>
As noted above, amongst the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of serine proteases of the blood coagulation cascade, and in particular inhibitors of thrombin and/or factor Xa. Preferred compounds inhibit thrombin more effectively than other serine proteases. More preferred compounds are thrombin inhibitors having, in addition, an IC50 value of less than 1 JJM. The compounds are useful for treating and preventing thrombin-mediated and thrombin-associated diseases. This includes a number of thrombotic and prothrombotic states in which the<br><br>
coagulation cascade is activated which include, but are not limited to, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, arterial occlusion from thrombosis or embolism, arterial reocclusion during or after angioplasty or thrombolysis, restenosis following arterial injury or invasive cardiological procedures, postoperative venous thrombosis or embolism, acute or chronic atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, cancer and metastasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. Compounds of the invention may also be used as in vitro anticoagulants or as anticoagulants in extracorporeal blood circuits, such as those necessary in dialysis and surgery.<br>
Serine proteases are enzymes which play an important role in the blood coagulation cascade. Apart from thrombin and factor Xa, other examples of this group of proteases comprise the factors Vila, IXa, XIa, Xlla, and protein C.<br>
Thrombin is the final serine protease enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The prime function of thrombin is the cleavage of fibrinogen to generate fibrin monomers, which are cross-linked to form an insoluble gel. In addition, thrombin regulates its own production by activation of factors V and VIII earlier in the cascade. It also has important actions at cellular level, where it acts on specific receptors to cause platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation and fibroblast proliferation. Thus thrombin has a central regulatory role in homeostasis and thrombus formation. Since inhibitors of thrombin may have a wide range of therapeutical applications, extensive research is done in this area.<br>
In the development of synthetic inhibitors of serine proteases, and more specifically of thrombin, the benzamidine moiety is one of the key structures. It mimics the protonated side-chain of the basic amino acids Arg and Lys of its natural substrates. Compounds with this moiety have been studied extensively and repeatedly. A very potent representative of this type of thrombin inhibitors is the amino acid derivative Na-(2-naphthylsulfonyl)-glycyl-4-amidinophenylalanin-piperidide (NAPAP) (Sturzebecher, J. et al., Thromb. Res. 29, 635-642, 1983). However, the pharmacological profile of NAPAP is unattractive for therapeutical applications: the compound shows toxic effects after intravenous administration and, in addition, poor oral bioavailability after oral administration. Up until now, the NAPAP-like benzamidine derivatives which have been investigated for use as thrombin inhibitors show these unfavourable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. It was assumed that these properties are due to the strong basicity of<br><br>
the amidino functionality of these compounds (Kaiser, et al., Pharmazie 42, 119-121, 1987; Stiirzebecher, J. et al., Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler, 373, 491-496, 1992). Several studies have been performed on variations of this basic structure (see for example Stiirzebecher, J. et al., Pharmazie 43, 782-783, 1988; Stiirzebecher, J. et al. (1993), DIC-Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Therapy of Disseminated Intravascular Fibrin Formation [G. Muller-Berghaus et al., eds.] pp. 183-190, Amsterdam, London, New York, Tokyo: Exerpta Medica). However, modifications of the benzamidine moiety decreasing its basicity always resulted in a drastic loss of anti-thrombin activity (Stiirzebecher, J. et al., J. Enzyme Inhibition 9, 87-99, 1995).<br>
Oral bioavailability is a property of thrombin inhibitors which is urgently searched for. Potent intravenous thrombin inhibitors are clinically effective in acute care settings requiring the treatment of thrombin-related diseases. However, particularly the prevention of thrombin-related diseases such as myocardial infarct, thrombosis and stroke require long-term therapy, preferably by orally dosing an anticoagulant. Consequently, the search for active, orally bioavailable thrombin inhibitors continues unabated. Oral bioavailability is at least in part related to the ability of compounds to be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The low oral bioavailability of NAPAP and its analogues may therefore be related to their deficient absorptive properties in the intestines.<br>
The present invention provides a solution to the deficient pharmacological properties of the NAPAP-like compounds, in particular with respect to the toxicity and the deficient absorptive properties.<br><br><br>
(3-12C)cycloalkyl or (7-15C)aralkyl, or R5 is NR7R8, wherein R7 and R8 are the same or different being H, (l-8C)alkyl, (3-12C)cycloalkyl, (6-14C)aryl, (7-15C)aralkyl, optionally subtituted with (l-8C)alkoxy, C(0)OH or C(0)OR6, or R7 and R8 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded are a nonaromatic (4-8)membered ring optionally containing another heteroatom, which ring may be condensed with another optionally aromatic ring and may be subtituted with OH, an oxo group, (l-8C)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogens or hydroxy groups, (2-8C)alkenyl, (l-8C)alkylidene, (2-8C)alkynyl, (l-8C)alkoxy, (l-8C)acyl, (6-14C)aryl, C(0)OH, C(0)OR6, C(0)NR9R10, wherein R9 and R10 are the same or different being H or (l-8C)alkyl, or S02RU and R11 is (l-8C)alkyl optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; Y is S02 or C(0); A is CHR12, R12 being H, phenyl, benzyl, (l-8C)alkyl, optionally substituted with OH or COR13 wherein R13 is OH, (l-8C)alkoxy, morpholino, morpholino(l-8C)alkoxy, NH2, NHR14 or NR14R15, R14 and R15 being independently (l-8C)alkyl optionally substituted with C(0)OR2 or R14 and R15 are a nonaromatic (4-8)membered ring together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, or R12 together with R3 is -(CH2)S- when R4 is Q, s being 2, 3 or 4, or A is NR2; and n is 0 or 1; or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Related thrombin inhibitors are disclosed in WO 92/16549 and WO 92/08709, wherein respectively para- and meta- substituted phenylalanine derivatives are described having an amidino, guanidino, oxamidino, aminomethyl or amino substituent. However, compounds with the amidino substituent show unfavourable pharmacological properties, whereas the other structures, with a modified amidino moiety, display a loss of activity (vide supra). Other modifications are described in EP 555824 where compounds are disclosed having a benzimidazolyl group, which compounds do not contain a primary amino functionality. Thrombin inhibitors having a benzamidine moiety have also been modified in other parts of the molecule, however, without improvement of the unfavourable pharmacological properties caused by the amidino substituent. Examples hereof are disclosed in EP 508220, wherein the compounds contain an azaglycyl group instead of the glycyl group of NAPAP; in DE 4115468, wherein that glycyl group is replaced e.g. by an asparty! group; in WO 94/18185, wherein no glycyl group is present in the compounds and the piperidine group which is present in NAPAP is replaced by a piperazide group; in WO 95/13274, wherein the compounds also do not have a glycyl group and<br><br>
modifications are made - in comparison with NAPAP - in the arylsulfonyl part and the piperidine part of the molecule; and in EP 236163, wherein Na-aikyl substituted amidinophenylalanin derivatives are described. Furthermore, Stiirzebecher, J. et al. (Thrombosis Research 54, 245-252, 1989) suggest that the alkylene linkage connecting the benzamidine moiety to the rest of the molecule may have a length of 1-3 methylene groups.<br>
Therefore, there is a still need for serine protease inhibitors, especially thrombin inhibitors, with more favourable pharmacological properties, such as the inhibitors of the present invention which potentially have good oral bioavailability.<br>

In the development of synthetic inhibitors of serine proteases, and more specifically of thrombin, the interest in small synthetic peptides that are recognized by proteolytic enzymes in a manner similar to that of natural substrates, has increased. As a result, new peptide-like inhibitors have been prepared, such as the transition state inhibitors of thrombin and the low molecular weight thrombin inhibitor Inogatran (Thromb. Haemostas. 1995, 73:1325 (Abs. 1633); WO 93/11152 (Example 67)),'which has been disclosed to be a potent and selective thrombin inhibitor. Related compounds are described in WO 95/23609; in comparison with Inogatran and its analogs, compounds disclosed in this patent application have an aromatic group in the agmatine-like group. Although these developments already have lead to new and meaningful insights, the search for more effective and more selective, and in particular orally applicable, thrombin inhibitors still proceeds.<br>

Compounds according to formula (I) can be prepared by deprotection of the following compound (e.g. by saponification)<br>

wherein G e.g. is an alkyl or benzyl group, followed by coupling with R5-H,<br>
or they can be prepared by deprotection of the compound<br>

wherein Pg is an N-protecting group, followed by coupling with one of the groups<br>
R'-Y-NR^A-CCOJ-OH, R]-Y-Lg or R^CfOJ-OH, wherein Lg is a leaving group.<br><br><br>
A compound of formula (VI) is converted into a compound of formula (la), being the compound of formula (I) wherein R5 is OR6, or an arylamino protected derivative thereof, either by coupling to R YLg (Lg is a leaving group) (n = 0), for example by reaction with R'YCl under basic conditions, e.g. by using triethylamine, or by peptide coupling with R'YNR2AC(0)0H (n = 1) or R1C(0)OH (n = 0) using as a coupling reagent for example N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l, 1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), wherein R1, R2, Y, n and A have the previously defined meanings. The protective group, if present, may optionally be removed.<br><br>
The ester group of a compound of formula (la) or an arylamino protected derivative thereof may be saponified to form the corresponding acid, after which the protective group, if present, may optionally be removed. The acid formed from a compound of formula (la) may be coupled to an amine of formula HNR7R8, wherein R7 and R8 have the previously defined meanings, for example by using DCCI/HOBT or TBTU, followed by removal of the optionally present protective group, to give a compound of formula (lb), which is the compound of formula (I), wherein R5 is NR7R8.<br><br>
An alternative procedure for the preparation of a compound of formula (lb) starts with the protection of the N-terminus of a compound of formula (V) with an N-protecting group Pg, such<br><br>
as Boc (terZ-butoxycarbonyl), forming a compound of formula (VII), where also the arylamino group may be protected.<br><br>
Subsequently, a compound of formula (VII) is coupled to an amine of formula HNR7R8 according to the procedure as described above for the conversion of a compound of formula (la) into (lb), after which the N-terminus is deprotected, followed by a coupling to R'YLg (n = 0), or by peptide coupling with R'YNR2AC(0)OH (n = 1) or R'C(0)OH (n = 0) according to the procedures as described above for the conversion of a compound of formula (VI) into a compound of formula (la), followed by removal of the optionally present protective group, giving the compound of formula (lb).<br>
A suitable process for the preparation of the compound of formula (V) is the conversion of a compound of formula (VIII), wherein Pg is an N-protecting group and Lg is a leaving group, such as the mesyl group, into a compound of formula (IX), for example by reaction with an appropriate amino acid derivative of the general formula PgR3N-CH[C(0)OR]2 in the presence of a base, e.g. [[(l,l-dimethylethoxy)carbonyl]amino] propanedioic acid diethyl ester in the presence of sodium ethoxide, wherein Pg and R3 have the previously defined meanings and both Pg-groups may be the same or different, and R is a branched or unbranched (l-8C)alkyl group, such as ethyl. (If here R3 is H, the amino group may be alkylated later in the procedure according to methods well known in the art to form compounds wherein R" is alkyl.) Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of a compound of formula (IX) gives a compound of formula (V).<br><br><br>
The compound according to formula (VIII) may be prepared by methods known in the art. The arylamino group of a compound of formula (II) is protected with an N-protecting group, after which the ring wherein X is located is provided with a formyl substituent either by treatment with a base, like lithium diisopropylamide, or with an organometallic reagent, like n-butyllithium, followed by addition of N,N-dimethylformamide, forming a compound of formula (X). (For compounds wherein m is 2 or 3, appropriate analogues of a compound of formula (X) may be prepared by this method which subsequently may be converted according the procedures as described for the conversion of a compound of formula (X).)<br><br>
The compound of formula (X) is reduced, e.g. using sodium borohydride, into the corresponding alcohol, which then is converted into a leaving group, e.g. an appropriate sulfonate group, thereby forming a compound of formula (VIII).<br>
Compounds of formula (X) are suitable intermediates for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 is Q. In those preparations a compound of formula (X) is reacted with an appropriate amino acid derivative of the general formula NH2-CHR4-C(0)OR, R4 and R having the previously defined meanings. The resulting imine is either directly converted into a compound of formula (XI) by reduction, using e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride, or isolated and subsequently<br><br>
reduced with an suitable reducing agent like sodium borohydride to form a compound of formula<br>
(XI).<br>
An alternative procedure for the preparation of a compound of formula (XI) starts from a<br>
compound of formula (VIII) by substitution of Lg by an appropriate amino acid derivative of the<br>
general formula NH2-CHR4-C(0)OR.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (XI) are then converted into compounds of formula (Ic), the compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 is Q and R5 is OR6, by a procedure analogous to the preparation of compounds of formula (la) from compounds of formula (VI) followed by removal of the protective group.<br><br>
From compounds of formula (Ic) compounds of formula (Id) are prepared, which are the compounds of formula (I), wherein R3 is Q and R5 is NR7R8, following the procedure as described for the conversion of (la) into (lb).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R12 together with R3 is -(CH2)S- can be prepared from amines of formula (VI) wherein R3 is hydrogen and the arylamino is optionally protected. Reaction of these amines with aldehydes of formula Pg(R2)NCH((CH2)(s.,)CHO)COOG, wherein Pg is a N-protecting group and R2, s and G have the previously defined meanings, gives imides which are reduced using e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride to give cyclic compounds of formula (XIII). After removal of the N-protecting group Pg the moiety R!Y can be introduced as described for the conversion of compounds of formula (VI) into compounds of formula (la). The group OR6 can be modified in the same way as described for the conversion of compounds of formula (la) into compounds of formula (lb) and removal of protecting groups if present gives compounds of formula (Ie). Furthermore, compounds of formula (Ie) and (XIII) can be prepared using the<br><br>
methods described by H. Mack et al. in J. Enzyme Inhibition 9, 73 (1995), wherein instead of the cyanophenyl building blocks used in the literature, building blocks containing moiety Q or a arylamino protected derivative thereof (e.g. compounds of formula (VI)) can be used.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (XX) can be prepared from compounds of formula (X). Reaction of a compound of formula (X) with an amine of formula (R')'NH2 gives an imide, which is either directly converted into a compound of formula (XXI) by reduction, using e.g. sodium cyano borohydride, or is isolated and subsequently reduced with a suitable agent like sodium borohydride to form a compound of formula (XXI), wherein (R')1 has the previously defined meanings.<br><br>
Alternatively a compound of formula (X) is reduced, using e.g. sodium borohydride, into the coresponding alcohol which then is converted into an azide using the method described by A.S. Thompson et al. in J. Org. Chem. 58, 5886 (1993). This azide can be reduced into an amine using reagents known in the art such as Pd / CaC03 catalyzed hydrogenation to yield a compound of formula (XXI) in which (R')1 is hydrogen.<br><br>
A compound of formula (XXI), or a derivative thereof wherein the arylamino is not protected, can be coupled with carboxylate compounds of formula J-D-E-OH, in which J, D and E have the previously defined meanings, or a protected derivative thereof, using peptide coupling methods. Subsequent removal of the optionally present protective groups gives compounds of formula (XX).<br>
Compounds of formula (XXa) can be prepared by reaction of amines of formula (XXI), wherein (R')1 is hydrogen with aldehydes of formula PgHNCH((CH2)(u.i)CHO)COOG, wherein Pg is a N-protecting group and u and G have the previously defined meanings, using the method described for compounds of formula (Ie).<br><br>
Compounds of formula (XXX) may be prepared in several ways in which the synthetic connection of moiety Q and the substituted phenyl part is made in moiety M. The method described in EP 0540051 may be used to prepare componds of formula (XXX) starting with compounds of formula (VIII).<br>
Compounds of formula (XL) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (XLI) with a compound of formula (XLII) and a compound of formula (XLIII), wherein (R'")1, (R'")2, , (R'")5, and (R"')6 have the previously defined meanings according to the methods described in EP 0728758. When (R'")1 or (R'")2 is the group of formula Q , compounds of formula (II), (VIII) or (X) or an arylamino protected derivative thereof can be used to prepare compounds of formula (XLI) or (XLII). When (R'")4 is the group of formula Q amino acids of formula (VI) or an arylamino protected derivative thereof can be used as starting materials. When (R"')5 or<br><br>
(R'")6 is the group of formula Q, compounds of formula (X) or an arylamino protected derivative thereof can be used as a starting material, being aldehydes of formula (XLIII), or used to prepare ketones of formula (XLIII).<br><br>
Compounds of formula (L) can be prepared using methods known in the art described for Gp Ilb/IIIa receptor antagonists containing a (hetero)arylamidine moiety instead of moiety Q. Compounds of formula (La) can conveniently be prepared from compounds of formula (X). An aldehyde of formula (X) is oxidized, using e.g. sodium chlorite, into the corresponding carboxylic acid. This carboxylic acid, or a derivative thereof wherein at the arylamino is not protected, can be coupled with an amine linker of formula HN(R"")1-U-(R"")1(R"")2-V or a N-protected derivative thereof, wherein (R"")1, U, (R"")2-and V have the previously defined meanings, using peptide coupling methods (e.g. using the amines and methods described in J. Med. Chem. 35, 4393 (1992), EP 0,505,868 or J. Med. Chem. 39, 3193 (1996)). Subsequent removal of the optionally present protective groups gives compounds of formula (La). Using a similar peptide coupling conditions a linker molecule having one free carboxylate can also be coupled with compound of formula (XXI), or a derivative thereof wherein the arylamino is not protected. Subsequent removal of the optionally present protective groups gives compounds of formula (L). Also halogen containing compounds of formula (II) can be used as starting material. The linker molecule can be attached using Pd mediated reactions such as Suzuki coupling, Heck reaction, or first transmetalation, using e.g. n-BuLi, and secondly reaction with a linker molecule containing an electrophilic function. Subsequent removal of the optionally present protective groups gives compounds of formula (L). For instance, Heck reaction of a halogen containing compound of formula (II) and an acrylic acid derivative leads to compounds of formula (Lb). An alternative method for the preparation of compounds of formula (Lb) is a condensation reaction of aldehydes of formula (X) with a malonic acid derivative. Modification of this malonic acid<br><br>
derivative using methods known in the art and subsequent removal of optionally present protecting groups yields compounds of formula (Lb).<br>
Compounds of the invention can also be prepared using a solid phase synthesis strategy. To prepare componds of formula (la) the carboxylic acid of the compounds of formula (VII) can be covalently attached to a polymeric support such as a polystyrene-resin using a ester or amide bond as anchoring bond. In this case protection of the arylamino function is preferred. For example anchoring using a ester bond to the Kaiser oxime resin, Boc-protection of the N-terminus and acetyl amide protection of the arylamino group. The N-terminus protecting group can be removed selectively followed by coupling to R'YLg (n = 0), or by peptide coupling with R'C(0)OH (n = 0), Pg2NR2AC(0)OH (n = 1) or R'YNR^CtCOOH (n = 1) according to the procedures described above for the conversion of compounds of formula (VI) into compounds of formula (la). Protecting group Pg2 is a protecting group that can be removed selectively. Removal of Pg2 liberates the N-terminus which can be coupled with R'YLg (n = 0), or with R1C(0)OH (n = 0) by peptide coupling methods according to the procedures described above for the conversion of compounds of formula (VI) into compounds of formula (la). Cleavage of the anchoring bond and removal of protecting groups, if present, gives compounds of formula (la) or (lb) depending on the type of anchoring bond and way of cleavage used. For example cleavage of the anchoring ester bond to the Kaiser oxime resin with amines of type HNR7R8 followed by removal of the optionally present protective groups yields compounds of formula (lb).<br>
The solid phase synthesis strategy outlined above starting from compounds of formula (VII) can also be applied using the carboxylic acid of compounds of formula (XII) to yield compounds of formula (Ic) or (Id). Further, this strategy can be applied to carboxylic acids of formula J-D-E-OH - in which J, D, and E have the previously defined meanings -, a synthetic precursor thereof or a protected derivative thereof. Cleavage of the anchoring bond to the Kaiser oxime resin using amines of formula (XXI) yields compounds of formula (XX) after removal of the optionally present protecting group.<br>
Alternatively, the arylamino functionality of moiety Q can be used to be covalently attached to a polymeric support using e.g. a carbamate functionality as method of anchoring and used in a solid phase synthesis.<br><br>
Several solid-phase synthesis strategies especially in the solid-phase synthesis of peptides are known in the art. An overview of solid-phase peptide synthesis is given by P.Lloyd-Williams, F. Albericio and E. Giralt in Tetrahedron 48, 11065 - 11133 (1993).<br>
The peptide coupling, as mentioned as a procedural step in the above described method to prepare the compounds of the invention, can be carried out by methods commonly known in the art for the coupling - or condensation - of peptide fragments such as by the azide method, mixed anhydride method, activated ester method, or, preferably, by the carbodiimide method, especially with the addition of catalytic and racemisation suppressing compounds like N-hydroxy-succinimide and N-hydroxybenzotriazole. An overview is given in The Peptides. Analysis. Synthesis. Biology. Vol 3, E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, eds. (Academic Press, New York, 1981).<br>
The term N-protecting group as used in this whole document means a group commonly used in peptide chemistry for the protection of an ot-amino group, like the fcrf-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group, the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group, the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group or the phthaloyl (Phth) group. Removal of the protecting groups can take place in different ways, depending on the nature of those protecting groups. Usually deprotection takes place under acidic conditions and in the presence of scavengers. An overview of amino protecting groups and methods for their removal is given in the above mentioned The Peptides. Analysis. Synthesis. Biology. Vol 3.<br>
Suitable leaving groups (Lg) are known in the art, for example from A.L. Ternay: Contemporary Organic Chemistry (2nd ed., W.B. Saunders Company, 1979, see pages 158 and 170-172). Preferred leaving groups are chloride, mesylate and tosylate.<br>

The compounds of this invention may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and may therefore be obtained as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture containing diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally. The exact dose and regimen of these compounds and compositions thereof will neccessarily be dependent upon the needs of the individual subject to whom the medicament is being administered, the degree of affliction or need and the judgment of the medical practitioner. In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, the daily dosages are for humans preferably 0.001-100 mg per kg body weight, more preferably 0.01-10 mg per kg body weight.<br>
The medicament manufactured with the compounds of this invention may also be used as adjuvant in acute anticoagulant therapy. In such a case, the medicament is administered with other compounds useful in treating such disease states.<br>
The compounds may also be used with implantable pharmaceutical devices such as those described in US Patent 4,767,628, the contents of which are incorporated by this reference. Then the device will contain sufficient amounts of compound to slowly release the compound (e.g. for more than a month).<br>
Mixed with pharmaceutical^ suitable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro et al., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture) the compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, e.g. for use as an injection preparation, or as a spray, e.g. for use as a nasal spray.<br>
For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used.<br><br>
Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactone, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts.<br>

The biological activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined by the following test methods.<br>
I. Anti-thrombin assay<br>
Thrombin (Factor Ha) is a factor in the coagulation cascade.<br>
The anti-thrombin activity of compounds of the present invention was assessed by measuring<br>
spectrophotometrically the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate s-2238 exterted by<br>
thrombin. This assay for anti-thrombin activity in a buffer system was used to assess the IC50-<br>
value of a test compound.<br>
Test medium:	Tromethamine-NaCl-polyethylene glycol 6000 (TNP) buffer<br>
Reference compound: 12581 (Kabi)<br><br>
Vehicle:<br>
Technique<br><br>
TNP buffer.<br>
Solubilisation can be assisted with dimethylsulphoxide, methanol, ethanol,<br>
acetonitrile or tert.-butyl alcohol which are without adverse effects in<br>
concentrations up to 2.5% in the final reaction mixture.<br>
Reagents*<br>
1.	Tromethamine-NaCl (TN) buffer<br>
Composition of the buffer:<br>
Tromethamine (Tris)     6.057  g     (50 mmol)<br>
NaCl	5.844   g   (100 mmol)<br>
Water to	1	1<br>
The pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.4 at 37 °C with HC1 (10 mmol-r1).<br>
2.	TNP buffer<br>
Polyethylene  glycol  6000  is  dissolved  in  TN  buffer  to  give  a<br><br><br><br>
concentration of 3 g-l<br><br>
-1.<br><br>
3.   S-2238 solution<br>
One vial S-2238 (25 mg; Kabi Diagnostica, Sweden) is dissolved in 20 ml TN buffer to give a concentration of 1.25 mg-ml"1 (2 mmoH"1).<br><br>
4.   Thrombin solution<br>
Human thrombin (16 000 nKat-vial"1; Centraal Laboratorium voor Bloedtransfusie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is dissolved in TNP buffer to give a stock solution of 835 nKat-ml"1. Immediately before use this solution is diluted with TNP buffer to give a concentration of 3.34 nKat-ml"1.<br>
*    -    All ingredients used are of analytical grade<br>
For aqueous solutions ultrapure water (Milli-Q quality) is used.<br>
Preparation of test.and. reference compound.solutions The test and reference compounds are dissolved in Milli-Q water to give stock concentrations of 102 molT1. Each concentration is stepwise diluted with the vehicle to give concentrations of 10"3, 10"4 and 10'5 molT1. The dilutions, including the stock solution, are used in the assay (final concentrations in the reaction mixture: 3-10"3; 10'3; 3-10"4; 10"4; 3-10"5; 10" 5; 3-10"6 and 10"6 mol-1'1, respectively).<br>
Procedure<br>
At room temperature 0.075 ml and 0.025 ml test compound or reference compound solutions or vehicle are alternately pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate and these solutions are diluted with 0.115 ml and 0.0165 ml TNP buffer, respectively. An aliquot of 0.030 ml S-2238 solution is added to each well and the plate is pre-heated and pre-incubated with shaking in an incubator (Amersham) for 10 min. at 37 °C. Following pre¬incubation the hydrolysis of S-2238 is started by addition of 0.030 ml thrombin solution to each well. The plate is incubated (with shaking for 30 s) at 37 °C. Starting after 1 min of incubation, the absorbance of each sample at 405 nm is measured every 2 min. for a period of 90 min. using a kinetic microtiter plate reader (Twinreader plus, Flow Laboratories).<br><br>
All data are collected in an IBM personal computer using LOTUS-MEASURE. For each compound concentration (expressed in molT1 reaction mixture) and for the blank the absorbance is plotted versus the reaction time in min.<br>
Evaluation of responses.	For   each   final   concentration   the   maximum   absorbance   was<br>
calculated from the assay plot. The IC5o-value (final concentration, expressed in (imol-I'1, causing 50% inhibition of the maximum absorbance of the blank) was calculated using the logit transformation analysis according to Hafner et al. (Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 1977; 27(11): 1871-3).<br><br>
II. Anti-factor Xa assay<br>
Activated Factor X (Xa) is a factor in the coagulation cascade. The anti-Xa activity of compounds of the present invention was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate s-2222 exterted by Xa. This assay for anti-Xa activity in a buffer system was used to assess the ICso-value of the test compound.<br>
In general the followed procedure and test conditions were analogous to those of the anti-thrombin assay as described above. Differences are indicated below.<br><br>
Reference compound: benzamidine<br>
Vehicle:	TNP buffer.<br>
Solubilisation can be assisted with dimethylsulphoxide, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile or tert.-butyl alcohol which are without adverse effects in concentrations up to 1% (for DMSO) and 2.5% (for the other solvents) in the final reaction mixture.<br>
Technique	Reagents*<br>
3.	S-2222 solution<br>
One vial S-2222 (15 mg; Kabi Diagnostica, Sweden) is dissolved in 10 ml water to give a concentration of 1.5 mg-ml"1 (2 mmoH"1).<br>
4.	Xa solution<br>
Bovine Factor Xa Human (71 nKat-vial"1; Kabi Diagnostica) is dissolved in 10 ml TNP buffer and then further diluted with 30 ml TNP buffer to give a concentration of 1.77 nKat-ml"1. The dilution has to be freshly prepared.<br>
Procedure<br>
Instead of the S-2238 solution (in anti-thrombin assay), the above S-2222<br>
solution is added to each well in this assay.<br><br><br>
III. Caco-2 permeability<br>
Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were used in passage nrs 25 to 35. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Nunc) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% of non-essential amino acid solution (lOOx), 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 fig/ml) in an atmosphere of 95% of air and 5% of C02. The pH of the medium was 7.4. For experiments cells were grown on Transwell-COL™ collagen treated cell culture filter inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2. The seeding density was 6.3 x 105 cells/cm2. Culture medium was added on each side of the filter. The growth of the cells and degree of confluency was checked every 2-3 days microscopically. Confluent monolayers were used on day 23-24 after seeding, at which time the transepithelial electrical resistance of the monolayers was at a stable value of approximately 260 Q.cm2. Permeability experiments were performed with compound concentrations of 0.1 mM or 1 mM in the apical compartment in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution with or without 0.5% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin. At 1, 2 and 3 hours after addition of compound to the cells the filters were placed into fresh acceptor compartments. In this way three one-hour samples were obtained. Compound concentration was determined in samples from acceptor compartments and donor compartment by HPLC or by measuring anti-thrombin activity. Permeability experiments of each compound were performed with 4 different filters. Results shown in the Table are means of the permeability between 2 and 3 hours after the start of the experiment of at least 2 filters.<br><br>
In the following Table the apparent Caco-2 permeability (Papp) is given in nm/s for compounds of the present invention compared to the prior art compounds NAPAP and "Pefa 1286"*.<br><br>
Conclusion: The apparent permeability of compounds of the present invention is significantly higher than that of the prior art compounds NAPAP and Pefa 1286. Compounds of the present invention will therefore be considerably better absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br><br>
