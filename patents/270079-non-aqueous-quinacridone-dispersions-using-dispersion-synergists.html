NON-AQUEOUS QUINACRIDONE DISPERSIONS USING DISPERSION<br>
SYNERGISTS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to stable quinacridone dispersions and inl<jet inks using specific dispersion synergists.></jet>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]   The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains compatible with the dispersion medium, thus stabilizing the pigment "particles in the dispersion medium. Typical polymeric dispersants include graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0005]   In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment<br><br><br>
surface and hydrophilic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br>
[0006]   The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron particles is more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable Inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]   These problems have lead to the design of very specific polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
[0008]   Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substitued by one or more sulphonic acid groups or ammonium salts thereof.<br>
[0009]    US 4461647 (ICI) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-insoluble asymmetric disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through azo groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]    US 4057436 (!C1) discloses pigment dispersions in organic liquids using polymeric or resinous dispersing agents in the presence of a substituted ammonium salt of a colored acid wherein there are between 16 and 60<br><br><br>
carbon atoms contained in at least 3 chains attaclied to the N-atom of the substituted ammonium ion.<br>
[0011]    US 6641655 (AVECIA) discloses the use of a diquaternary ammonium salt of a coloured acid as fluidising agent wherein the diquaternary ammonium cation contains two or more nitrogen atoms.<br>
[0012]  Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is the case for quinacridone pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous pigment dispersions, especially stable non-aqueous ink-jet inks.<br>
[0013] Sulfonated quinacridone derivatives have been disclosed, for example, by US 6152968 (BASF) . However, US 6152968 (BASF) is silent on their use in non-aqueous media.<br>
[0014]    US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) discloses the use of a pigment and its sulfonation product in a solid solution, water and organic solvents such as xylene. However, US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) is silent on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of quinacridone type pigments and their sulfonation products.<br>
[0015]    US 4844742 (CIBA GEIGY) discloses the surface modification of<br>
quinacridone pigments, wherein the pigment is treated with a solvent-free, basic, nitrogen-containing copolymer of the polyurethane series and with a dispersion-improving quinacridone derivative resulting in compositions exhibiting enhanced performance in automative and other finish systems. The derivatives used are phthalimidomethyl or sulfonic acid derivatives of quinacridone. Again no details are given on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of quinacridone type pigments.<br>
[0016]    WO 02/064680 (CLARIANT) discloses quinacridone derivatives<br>
comprising sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups used as pigment dispersants in aqueous and non-aqueous Inkjet inks and in hotmelt inkjet inks. Radiation curable inkjet inks are not disclosed:<br>
[0017]    DE 1619618 (DU PONT) discloses quinacridone pigments comprising upto 25 wt% of quinacridone derivatives comprising carboxyl groups. Pigment dispersions using the quinacridone derivatives are not disclosed.<br><br><br>
[0018]    US 20050196697 (KONICA MINOLTA) discloses actinic ray curable compositions containing a quinacridone pigment; a dispersant; a cationically polymerizable monomer; a photo acid generator; and a quinacridone derivative. The exemplified quinacridone derivatives comprise sulfonamide groups.<br>
[0019]    US 6451103 (TOYO INK) discloses self-dispersible aqueous pigment dispersions of quinacridone pigments with water-soluble pigment derivatives comprising one or more groups having a carboxyiic acid or sulfonic acid or salts thereof. Non-aqueous pigment dispersions are not disclosed.<br>
[0020]   For consistent image quality, inkjet inks require a dispersion stability<br>
capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in the dispersion medium of the inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives.<br>
[0021]   Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture pigmented inkjet inks using quinacridone pigments in a non-aqueous medium exhibiting a high dispersion quality and stability.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
[0022]   It is an object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous<br>
quinacridone dispersions with high dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0023]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous<br>
quinacridone inkjet inks producing images of high image quality with a high optical density.<br>
[0024]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0025]   It has been surprisingly found that non-aqueous quinacridone pigment<br>
dispersions of high dispersion quality and stability were obtained by using a quinacridone derivative containing a carboxyl group as dispersion synergist, whereas quinacridone derivatives containing only sulfonic acid groups or other compounds containing a carboxyl group failed.<br><br><br>
[0026]   Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous pigment dispersion comprising a quinacridone pigment, a polymeric dispersant and a dispersion synergist in a non-aqueous dispersion medium characterized in that said dispersion synergist is a quinacridone derivative substituted on one of the two nitrogen atoms of the quinacridone basic chromophore structure by a group comprising at least one carboxyl group or a salt thereof.<br>
[0027]   Objects of the present invention have also been realized with a method for printing an ink-jet image comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a curable ink-jet ink set containing a curable ink-jet ink comprising one or more radical polymerizable monomers, a quinacridone pigment and a quinacridone derivative containing at least one carboxyl group or a salt thereof;<br>
(b)	printing an image with said curable ink-jet comprising a quinacridone pigment; and<br>
(c)	curing said printed image.<br>

[0049]  A combination with other types of acid groups or salts thereof, such as ' sulphonic acid and phosphoric acid or salts thereof, may also be advantageously used.<br>
[0050]  The at least one carboxyl group or a salt thereof may be attached directly to the quinacridone structure or may be attached through a linking group containing 1 or more carbon atoms. The linking group contains preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 12 and most preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment the linking group is a straight chain of 1 or more carbon atoms, wherein some of the carbon atoms may be substituted by a heteroatom such as an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, a sulphur atom, a phosphorous atom, selenium atom and a tellurium atom. It is also possible that, if present, some of the hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon atom are substituted by a heteroatom such as an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, a sulphur atom, a halogen atom, a phosphorous atom, selenium atom and a tellurium atom.<br>
[0051]   In case that the dispersion synergist contains a salt of a carboxyl group, the charge of the carboxylate anion is compensated by a cation.<br>
[0052]   The cation may be an inorganic cation selected from the group consisting of the la and lia metals in the table of Mendeleev. In a preferred embodiment the cation is Li+.<br>
[0053]   The cation may also be an organic cation. A preferred cation is an ammonium and a substituted ammonium group.<br>
[0054]   In a preferred embodiment the cation is selected from the substituted<br>

[0055]   Particularly preferred cations include the substituted ammonium groups selected from the group consisting of +N(CH3)2(C18H37)2,<br>
*NH{CH3)2(Ci8H37), "N(CH3)2(Cl2H25)2, *NH(CH3)2(Cl2H25), + N(CH3)2(CioH2l)2, ^NH(CH3)2(C10H2l), ^N(CH3)2(C8Hl7)2,<br>

[0058]   The dispersion synergist is preferably added in an amount between 0.1 and 20wt% based upon the weight of the pigment.<br>
[0059]   The synergist should be additional to the amount of polymeric<br>
dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/dispersion synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dispersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 100:1, preferably between 2:1 and 20:1.<br>
Quinacridone pigments<br><br><br>
[0060]  The quinacridone pigment may be chosen from those disclosed by<br>
HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769.<br>
[0061]   Suitable pigments include C.I. Pigment Red 122, 192, 202, 207 and 209.<br>
[0062]   Particular preferred quinacridone pigments are C.I. Pigment Violet 19 and C.I. Pigment Red 122.<br>
[0063]   Suitable pigments include mixed crystals of the above particular preferred pigments. A commercially available example is Cinquasia Magenta RT-355-D from Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Preferably the quinacridone pigment is selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Violet 19, C.I. Pigment Red 122, C.I. Pigment Red 202 and mixed crystals of quinacridone pigments.<br>
[0064]   Mixed crystals are also referred to as solid solutions. Under certain conditions different quinacridones mix with each other to form solid solutions, which are quite different from both physical mixtures of the compounds and from the compounds themselves. In a solid solution, the molecules of the components enter into the same crystal lattice, usually, but not always, that of one of the components. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting crystalline solid is characteristic of that solid and can be clearly differentiated from the pattern of a physical mixture of the same components in the same proportion. In such physical mixtures, the x-ray pattern of each of the components can be distinguished, and the disappearance of many of these lines is one of the criteria of the formation of solid solutions.<br>
[0065]   Pigment particles in pigmented Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0066]   The average particle size of the pigment in a pigmented Inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 μm. Preferably, the numeric average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 μm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 μm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 pm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm.<br><br><br>
[0067]   The quinacridone pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the non-aqueous pigment dispersion. Dispersants [0068]  The dispersant used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to<br>
the present invention is preferably a polymeric dispersant. [0069]   Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Copolymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the present invention may have the following polymer compositions;<br>
randomly polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant;<br>
graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and<br>
mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0070]   Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the<br>
present invention may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 1-18.<br><br><br>
[0071]   Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). [0072]  Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopoiymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. [0073]   Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process). [0074]   Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the present invention may be prepared via addition or condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include those described by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 39-606. [0075]   Addition polymerization methods suitable for preparing polymeric dispersants for use in pigment dispersions according to the present invention include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include:<br>
RAFT; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer; •    ATRP: atom transfer radical polymerization<br>
MADIX: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using<br>
a transfer active xanthate;<br>
Catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes);<br>
Nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations; [0076]   Other suitable controlled polymerization methods include:<br>
GTP: group transfer polymerization;<br>
Living cationic (ring-opening) polymerizations;<br>
Anionic co-ordination insertion ring-opening polymerization; and<br>
Living anionic (ring-opening) polymerization.<br><br><br>

[0146]   If the non-aqueous pigment dispersion is a curable pigment dispersion, the dispersion medium comprises one or more monomers and/or oligomers to obtain a liquid dispersion medium. Sometimes, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of an organic solvent to improve the dissolution of the dispersant. The content of organic solvent should be lower than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink. In other cases, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of water, for example, to improve the spreading of the Inkjet ink on a hydrophilic surface, but preferably the Inkjet ink contains no water.<br>
[0147]   Preferred organic solvents include alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene.

[0148]   In the case of a curable Inkjet ink, the dispersion medium preferably consists of monomers and/or oligomers.<br><br><br>
Monomers and oligomers<br>
[0149]   Any monomer or oligomer may be used as curable compound for the curable Inkjet ink. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used. The viscosity of ;the Inkjet ink can be adjusted by varying the ratio between the monomers and oligomers.<br>
[0150]   Any method of conventional radical polymerization, photo-curing system using photo acid or photo base generator, or photo induction alternating copolymerization may be employed. In general, radical polymerization and cationic polymerization are preferred, and photo induction alternating copolymerization needing no initiator may also be employed. Furthermore, a hybrid system of combinations of these systems is also effective.<br>
[0151]   Cationic polymerization is superior in effectiveness due to lack of inhibition of the polymerization by oxygen, however it is expensive and slow, especially under conditions of high relative humidity. If cationic polymerization is used, it is preferred to use an epoxy compound together with an oxetane compound to increase the rate of polymerization. Radical polymerization is the preferred polymerization process.<br>
[0152]   Any polymerizable compound commonly known in the art may be<br>
employed.

Initiators<br>
[0174]   The curable Inkjet ink preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator<br>
typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator.

The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable inkjet inks may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br><br><br>

[0184]   Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-Initiators are aryldiazonium ■   salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0185]   The curable Inkjet ink may contain a photo-initiator system containing one or more photo-initiators and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizers include photoreducible xanthene,<br><br><br>

[0186]   In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable Inkjet ink may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known.

[0189]   A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of the total weight of the curable liquid, and more preferably 1 - 15 wt% of the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0190]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
Inhibitors<br>
[0191]   The radiation curable Inkjet ink may contain a polymerization inhibitor. Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used.<br>

[0193]   Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization is determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is preferably lower than 2 wt% of the total ink.<br>
Binders<br>
[0194]   Non-aqueous Inkjet ink compositions preferably comprise a binder resin. The binder functions as a viscosity controlling agent and also provides fixability relative to the polymeric resin substrate, e.g. a polyvinyl chloride substrate, also called vinyl substrate. The binder must be selected to have a good solubility in the solvent(s).<br>
[0195]   Suitable examples of binder resins include acrylic resins, modified acrylic resins, styrene acrylic resins, acrylic copolymers, acrylate resins, aldehyde resins, rosins, rosin esters, modified rosins and modified rosin resins, acetyl polymers, acetal resins such as polyvinyl butyral, ketone resins,<br><br><br>

Surfactants<br>
[0197]   The Inkjet ink may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity less than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink and particularly in a total less than 10 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
[0198]   Suitable surfactants include fluorinated surfactants, fatty acid salts, ester salts of a higher alcohol, alkylbenzene sulphonate salts, sulphosuccinate ester salts and phosphate ester salts of a higher alcohol (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate), ethylene oxide adducts of a higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts of an alkylphenol, ethylene oxide adducts of a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol and ethylene oxide adducts thereof (for example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, and SURFYNOLTM 104, 104H, 440, 465 and TG available from AIR PRODUCTS &amp; CHEMICALS INC.).<br>
[0199]   For non-aqueous Inkjet inks preferred surfactants are selected from fluoro surfactants (such as fluorinated hydrocarbons) and silicone surfactants. The silicones are typically siloxanes and can be alkoxylated, polyether modified, polyether modified hydroxy functional, amine modified, epoxy modified and other modifications or combinations thereof. Preferred siloxanes are polymeric, for example polydimethylsiloxanes.<br>
[0200]   In a curable Inkjet ink a fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, preferably a cross-linkable surfactant is used. Polymerizable<br><br><br>
monomers having surface-active effects include silicone modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, acrylated siloxanes, polyether modified acrylic modified siloxanes, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacrylates.

[0201]  Suitable humectants include triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyl urea and dialkyl thiourea, diols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexanediols; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof. Preferred humectants are triethylene glycol mono butylether, glycerol and 1,2-hexanediol. The humectant is preferably added to the Inkjet ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 40 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 wt%.<br>
Preparation of a pigmented Inkjet ink<br>
[0202]   The Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the dispersant.<br>
[0203]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0204]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide beads.<br>
[0205]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks<br><br><br>
as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0206]   The Inkjet ink may contain more than one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0207]   The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0208]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0209]   The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0210]   After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0211]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br><br><br>
[0212]   The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0213]   A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80°C.<br>
[0214]   The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength λref. The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength.<br><br>
[0215]   The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1. Measurement of SSF<br>
[0217]   The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an Ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength.The reference wavelength chosen for a magenta Inkjet Ink was 650 nm.<br>
[0218]   The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The Ink was diluted with ethyl acetate to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed In transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 3. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and ethyl acetate was chosen as a blank.<br><br><br><br>
[0219]   Efficient pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0220]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. Pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30 and a loss in SSF of less than 35%.<br>
3.	Particle size<br>
[0221]   The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of the pigmented inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0222]  The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet<br>
containing 1.5 mL ethyl acetate and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good ink jet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is below 200 nm, preferably about 100 nm. The pigmented inkjet ink is considered to be a stable pigment dispersion if the particle size remained below 200 nm after a heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0223]   This example illustrates that non-aqueous C.I. Pigment Red 122 inkjet inks with high dispersion quality for producing high image quality are obtained when using quinacridone derivatives containing one or more carboxyl groups or salts thereof as dispersion synergists compared to dispersions lacking a quinacridone derivative or with other compounds having a carboxyl group.<br>
Dispersion synergists<br>
[0224]   The compounds SYN-1 to SYN-4 were used as comparative dispersion synergists.<br><br><br><br>
Dispersion synergist QAD-1<br>
[0225]   Synthesis of the dispersion synergist QAD-1 was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br>
31.2 g (0.1 mo!) of the pigment PV19 in 500 mL dimethylsulfoxide was dissolved by addition of 22.44 g (0.2 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide. The blue solution was heated to about 70oC and 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of methyl-4-(bromomethyl)benzoate was added. The mixture was cooled to roomtemperature after 2 hours and the compound QA-1 was precipitated, filtered and washed with methanol. The yield was 77%.<br><br><br><br>
Formation of the dispersion synergist QAD-1 was accomplished by hydrotization of QA-1. This reaction took place during a reflux of 46 g (0.1 mol) of compound QA-1 in a mixture of ethanol and 50 mL (0.5 mol) of 29% sodiumhydroxide solution. After 1 hour the mixture was cooled down, the precipitate was filtered and washed with water. The precipitate was mixed in 1000 mL water and the acid form was made by the addition of 50 mL (0.6 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The dispersion synergist QAD-1 was filtered and washed with water and ethanol. The yield was 78%.<br>

[0226]   Synthesis of the dispersion synergist QAD-2 was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br>
34 g (0.1 mol) of the pigment PR122 in 500 mL dimethylsulfoxide was dissolved by addition of 22.44 g (0.2 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide. The blue solution was heated to about 70oCand 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of methyl-4-(bromomethyl)benzoate was added. The mixture was cooled after 2 hours and the product was precipitated, filtered and washed with methanol. The yield was 65%.<br><br><br><br>

The dispersion synergist QAD-2 was filtered and washed with water and ethanol. The yield was 71%.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0227]   All Inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 4, except that different dispersion synergists were used. In some examples, the ratio of polymeric dispersant over dispersion synergist was altered through replacement or addition of the organic solvent DEGDEE.<br><br>
[0228]   An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment PR122, the polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 32000, the dispersion synergist and the organic<br><br><br>
solvent DEGDEE with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20 mL of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth. [0229]   Using the above method, the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-1 to COMP-5 and the inventive Inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-6 were prepared according to Table 5. The amount of synergist indicates how much dispersion synergist was used in wt% based on the polymeric dispersant. The spectral separation factor SSF was determined to evaluate the dispersion quality. The results are listed in Table 5.<br><br>
[0230]   From Table 5, it should be clear that only the inventive Inkjet inks INV-1 to \N\/-6 using quinacridone derivatives containing a carboxyl group as a dispersion synergist delivered pigmented Inkjet inks of superior quality compared to the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-2 to COMP-5 using comparative dispersion synergists with a carboxyl group or compared to<br><br><br>
the comparative Inkjet ink COMP-I lacking a dispersion synergist. The<br>
concentration of the dispersion synergist can be altered to maximize<br>
dispersion quality. EXAMPLE 2 [0231]   This example Illustrates that stable C.i. Pigment Violet 19 dispersions were<br>
