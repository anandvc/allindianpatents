Detailed Description<br>
Figures 1 to 2 show a non-limiting example of a sanitary absorbent article such as,<br>
for example, a sanitary napkin 20. The sanitary napkin 20 comprises a main body 22<br>
having generally opposing longitudinal side edges 24, 26, and an imaginary longitudinal<br>
centerline 28 running down the center of the sanitary napkin, generally equidistant from<br>
the longitudinal side edges 24, 26. In addition, the main body 22 also has two generally<br>
opposing transverse sides 30, 32, and an imaginary transversal centerline 42 that runs<br>
across the body of absorbent article 20, thereby intersecting the imaginary longitudinal<br>
centeriine 28. The term "longitudinal", as used herein, refers to a line, axis or direction in<br>
the .plane of the absorbent article 20 that is generally aligned with (e.g., approximately<br>
parallel to) a vertical plane which bisects a standing wearer into left and right body halves<br>
when the absorbent article 20 is worn, sanitary napkin 20 includes a plurality of<br><br>
protrusions 72, 74, 76 and 78 on its body contacting surface (i.e., on cover layer 56). The<br>
protrusions 72, 74, 76 and 78 extend above a reference plane R (as shown in Figure 3a)<br>
which lies on the planar portion of the body contacting surface of the fluid pervious cover<br>
layer 56.<br>
Flaps 34, 36 respectively project laterally from each of the longitudinal side edges<br>
24, 26 away from the longitudinal centerline 28 of the main body 22. It should be noted,<br>
however, that sanitary napkins having no flaps also remain within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 3a shows a cross section of a sanitary napkin 20, featuring a laminate<br>
structure with main body 22 generally including: a fluid-permeable cover layer 56, having<br>
a body-contacting surface when the napkin is in use; a liquid-impervious barrier layer 58,<br>
having a garment facing surface when the napkin is in use; and an absorbent system 60<br>
therebetween. The absorbent system 60 may have a single layer or, alternatively, a<br>
plurality of layers. In the example of implementation depicted in the drawings, absorbent<br>
system 60 includes a multi-layer structure. Specifically, the absorbent system 60 has a<br>
first layer, called "transfer layer" 62, immediately underneath the fluid-permeable cover<br>
layer 56, and a second layer, called "absorbent core layer" 64, between transfer layer 62<br>
and liquid-impervious barrier layer 58. The fluid-permeable cover layer 56 and the liquid-<br>
impervious barrier layer 58 are sealed together along their peripheral edges (including the<br>
flaps 34, 36) to form a peripheral seal 50 {shown in Figure 2), containing the absorbent<br>
system 60. Peripheral seal 50 can be realized by using any means commonly known in<br>
the art such as by gluing, crimping, pressure and/or heat sealing, ultrasonics, and the like.<br>
In addition, although peripheral seal 50 is shown as being continuous, the present<br>
invention also contemplates embodiments where the peripheral seal 50 is intermittent and<br>
does not therefore fully enclose absorbent system 60. Thus, a variety of seal<br>
configurations are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Each of the layers mentioned above will now be described in greater detail.<br>
Fluid-Permeable Cover Layer<br>
With reference to Figures 1 to 3b, the fluid-permeable cover layer 56 is the top<br>
layer of the sanitary napkin 20. The purpose of the fluid-permeable cover layer 56 is to<br><br>
provide an interface that would normally contact the body of the wearer when the sanitary<br>
napkin 20 is in use. The fluid-permeable cover layer 56 is porous to liquids since its main<br>
function is to capture as quickly as possible a discharge of bodily exudate and transfer it<br>
to the absorbent system 60 underneath.<br>
Under one specific example of implementation, the fluid-permeable cover layer 56<br>
is formed from an apertured thermoplastic film. Such films are common in the art.<br>
Because of the high porosity of such films, they accomplish the function of quickly<br>
transferring body exudate to the inner layers (i.e. the absorbent system 60) of the napkin<br>
20.<br>
The fluid-permeable cover layer 56 can also be made of fibrous materials, such as<br>
non-woven fibrous materials the fluid-permeable cover layer 56 may be composed of<br>
only one type of fiber, such as polyester, or may be composed of bioomponent or<br>
conjugate fibers having a low melting point component and a high melting point<br>
component. Bicomponent fibers may be made up of a polyester core and a polyethylene<br>
sheath. The use of appropriate bicomponent materials results in a fusible non-woven<br>
fabric. Using a fusible fabric increases, the ease with which the fluid-permeable cover<br>
layer 56 may be mounted to the barrier layer 58 at the peripheral seal 50.<br>
The fibers may be selected from a variety of natural and synthetic materials such<br>
as nylon, polyester, rayon (in combination with other fibers), cotton acrylic fiber and the<br>
like, and combinations thereof. It will be evident to the person skilled in the art that a wide<br>
variety of other types of non-woven fabric materials can also be used.<br>
Transfer Layer<br>
Subjacent to the fluid-permeable cover layer 56 on its inner side and preferably<br>
bonded thereto is the fluid transfer layer 62, that may form part of the absorbent system<br>
60. The transfer layer 62 provides a means of rapidly receiving body fluid from the fluid-<br>
permeable cover layer 56 and holding it until the highly-dense, slower absorbing<br>
absorbent core layer 64 has an opportunity to absorb it.<br>
The transfer layer 62 is, preferably, more dense than the fluid-permeable cover<br>
layer 56 and has a larger proportion of smaller pores than does the latter. These<br><br>
attributes allow the transfer layer 62 to contain body fluid and hold it away from the outer<br>
side of the fluid-permeable cover layer 56, thereby preventing the fluid from re-wetting the<br>
fluid-permeable cover layer 56 and its surface.<br>
The transfer layer 62 may be composed of fibrous materials such as wood pulp,<br>
polyester, rayon, flexible foam, or the like, or combinations thereof. The transfer layer 62<br>
may also comprise thermoplastic fibers for the purpose of stabilizing the layer and<br>
maintaining its structural integrity. The transfer layer 62 may be treated with surfactant on<br>
one or both of its sides in order to increase its wettability. However, the transfer layer 62<br>
is generally relatively hydrophilic and may not require additional treatment. The transfer<br>
layer 62 is preferably bonded on both sides to the adjacent layers, i.e. the fluid-permeable<br>
cover layer 56 and the absorbent core layer 64.<br>
Absorbent Core Layer<br>
Immediately subjacent to and bonded to the transfer layer 62 is the absorbent<br>
core layer 64; the latter also forming part of the absorbent system 60. The absorbent<br>
system 60 may comprise only the absorbent core layer 64 or it may comprise a plurality<br>
of layers, such as the absorbent core layer 64 in combination with the transfer layer 62 or<br>
any other additional layer.<br>
The absorbent core layer 64 is a highly dense layer having a fine porosity. It has<br>
a large liquid-holding capacity and it is extremely retentive. Preferably, the absorbent<br>
layer 64 comprises a pulp fluff material and may optionally include other absorbent<br>
materials or non-absorbent materials such as conjugate fibers, fusible fibers, binders,<br>
sphagnum moss, superabsorbents, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Liquid-Impervious Barrier Layer<br>
Underlying the absorbent system 60 is a liquid-impervious barrier layer 56. The<br>
liquid impervious barrier layer comprises liquid-impervious film material such as to<br>
prevent liquid that is entrapped in the absorbent core layer 64 from egressing the sanitary<br>
napkin 20 and staining the wearer's undergarment. The liquid-impervious barrier layer 58<br>
can be made of polymeric film, such as polyethylene or a polyethylene/ethylvinyl acetate<br>
(EVA), which are both inexpensive and readily available. The polymeric film is capable of<br><br>
fully blocking the passage of liquid or gas that may emanate from the absorbent system<br>
60. In a variant, breathable films may be used that allow passage of gases while blocking<br>
liquid.<br>
Thickness of the Sanitary Napkin<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has a thickness T of about 5mm or less in the dry state.<br>
The term "thickness" as used herein, refers to caliper of the product and, for purposes of<br>
this invention is defined as the distance between the garment facing surface of the liquid-<br>
impervious barrier layer 58 and the highest point on the body-contacting surface of the<br>
fluid permeable cover layer 56 (thickness T shown in Figure 3B). One apparatus that has<br>
been found to be suitable for measuring the thickness of the sanitary napkin 20 is a<br>
footed dial (thickness) gauge, available from Ames B.C. Co. of Melrose, MA, with foot 1<br>
1/8" diameter with stand, 2 oz. deadweight accurate to 0.001". A digital type apparatus is<br>
preferred.<br>
If the sanitary napkin is individually folded and wrapped, the sample is unwrapped<br>
and carefully flattened by hand. The re/ease paper is removed from the sample and it is<br>
repositioned back gently across the positioning adhesive lines so as to not compress the<br>
sample. Flaps (if any) are folded back under the sample, prior to taking the thickness<br>
reading in the center of the sample.<br>
The foot of the gauge is raised and the sample is placed on the anvil such that the<br>
foot of the gauge is approximately centered to the sample (or in the location of interest on<br>
the sample of interest). When lowering the foot, care is taken to avoid allowing the foot to<br>
"drop" or that undue force is not applied. The read out is allowed to stabilize for<br>
approximately 5 seconds, and the thickness reading is then taken.<br>
Protrusions<br>
Referring again to Figures 1 to 4b, sanitary napkin 20 includes a plurality of<br>
protrusions 72 which respectively extend along longitudinal side edges 24, 26 (and thus<br>
along imaginary longitudinal centerline 28 and a pair of protrusions 74 which respectively<br>
extend along transverse sides 30, 32 (and thus along imaginary transverse centerline 42),<br>
76 and 78 on its body contacting surface (i.e., on cover layer 56). The sanitary napkin 20<br><br>
also features a pair of protrusions 76, 78 in a more central area of main body 22, meaning<br>
that they extend towards the longitudinal centerline of the main body 22. Protrusions 76,<br>
78 intersect one another such that they share a common boundary, in addition,<br>
protrusions 76 and 78 run obliquely with respect to the imaginary longitudinal centerline<br>
28.The protrusions 72, 74, 76 and 78 extend above a reference plane R (as shown in<br>
Figure 3a) which lies on the planar portion of the body contacting surface of the fluid<br>
pervious cover layer 56. Figures 1 and 2 show protrusions 72, 74, 76 and 78 having an<br>
elongated and generally rectangular shape, however, it should be specifically understood<br>
that protrusions having different shapes remain within the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, the protrusions could be in the shape of a square or a parallelogram (i.e.,<br>
such as a diamond shaped lozenge). Moreover, the protrusions could be of circular or<br>
elliptic shape.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 also show that protrusions 72, 74, 76 and 78 define a protrusion<br>
pattern which is symmetrical about both the imaginary longitudinal centerline 28 and the<br>
imaginary transverse centerline 42. However, it should be noted that the protrusions<br>
could also define a protrusion pattern which is symmetrical along a single one of the<br>
imaginary longitudinal centerline 28 or the imaginary transverse centerline 42.<br>
Alternatively, the protrusions can be randomly distributed along the sanitary napkin's 20<br>
body contacting surface such as to define a protrusion pattern which is not symmetrical<br>
along either one or both the imaginary centerlines. Protrusions 72, 74, and 76 are spaced<br>
from one another on the surface of the main body 22 such that they are not in contact<br>
with each other.<br>
As shown Jn Figures 3a and 3b, the protrusions are formed as an integral part of<br>
at least one layer of the sanitary napkin 20, meaning that they are formed out of the<br>
material of at least one of the layers of the sanitary napkin 20, and are not distinct parts<br>
that are affixed to the main body 22. Shown in Figure 3b, is an upper treated component<br>
75 that includes protrusions 72 that are formed of the fluid-pervious cover layer 56 and<br>
the transfer layer 62, which are positioned immediately adjacent one another, meaning<br>
that they lie on top of one another. In an alternative example of implementation shown in<br>
Figures 4a and 4b, the upper treated component 75 includes protrusions 72 that are<br>
formed of the fluid-permeable cover layer 56, the transfer layer 62, and the absorbent<br>
core layer 64. It should be specifically understood, however, that any of the layers of the<br>
sanitary napkin 20 (including the liquid-impervious barrier layer 58 depicted in Figures 3a<br><br>
and 3b) can be treated so as to form the upper treated component 75 having projections,<br>
irrespective of what is shown in Figures 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b.<br>
Figures 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b further show that the upper treated component 75 has a<br>
pair of main surfaces 80, 82 which are opposite one another. The treated component 75<br>
includes protrusions 72 on main surface 80 and recesses 84 on main surface 82. Note<br>
that, in this case, each recess 84 registers with its corresponding protrusion 72 due to the<br>
method of manufacture, which will be described in more detail further on with respect to<br>
Figures 7a and 7b. Each recess 84 is delimited by the upper treated component 75 as<br>
well as a lower component 77 (shown in Figures 3B and 4B). As such, the spacing<br>
between the treated component 75 and the lower component 77 is greater within the<br>
boundary 79 of a recess 84 than outside the boundary 79 of a recess 84. In the case of<br>
Figures 3a and 3b, the lower component 77 includes the absorbent core layer 64 and the<br>
barrier layer 58 and in the case of Figures 4a and 4b, the lower component 77 includes<br>
only the barrier layer 58. It should be noted, however, that absorbent core layer 64 could<br>
also be part of the treated component 75, as mentioned previously. When considering<br>
Figures 1 to 4b, it should be apparent to the reader that the recesses 84 form some type<br>
of inner cavity within sanitary napkin 22. In this specific case, the recesses 84 form an<br>
inner channel.<br>
Moreover, although Figures 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b show the lower component 77 as<br>
being substantially planar when the sanitary napkin 20 is laid flat, it should be understood<br>
that a lower component 77 having a shape which is not planar also remains within the<br>
scope of the present invention. In addition, the recesses 84 shown in the figures are<br>
essentially void areas (or in the very least low-density areas), meaning that essentially no<br>
other material is present therein. However, in a variant not shown, each recess 84 could<br>
also contain additional material therein which is different than that which forms the upper<br>
treated component 75 and the lower component 77. For example, the recesses 84 could<br>
include a filler material, such as super absorbent polymer (SAP), odor control materials,<br>
or other functional materials in particulate or solid form.<br>
Figures 3b and 4b also show that the upper treated component 75 is<br>
characterized by a thickness U which is fairly substantial when compared with the total<br>
thickness T of sanitary napkin 20. For example, the sanitary napkin 20 may have a ratio<br>
U/T of at least 0.2.<br><br>
Each of (he protrusions 72, 74, 76, and 78 on (he main body 22 of the sanitary<br>
napkin extends by a height H of at least 0.5mm above the reference plane R, and has a<br>
width to height W/H ratio which generally varies between about 2 and about 10.<br>
The inventors have found that sanitary napkins 20 having protrusions with a height H<br>
and a width to height ratio W/H as described in the present application, advantageously<br>
convey to a user the appearance of thickness, which instills in the user a sense of<br>
confidence that the sanitary napkin will be able to absorb and retain bodily exudates. In<br>
addition, the inventors have found that sanitary napkins 20 having protrusions as described<br>
herein have a lower penetration time. "Penetration time" is defined as the time taken for the<br>
sanitary napkin 20 to absorb a predetermined quantity of a specific liquid.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a specific theory or mechanism of action, the<br>
sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention is believed to demonstrate low penetration<br>
times due to the fact that the protrusions provide an increased surface area over which<br>
the fluid can be absorbed, and that the fluid impinging upon the protrusions may be<br>
partially directed downward into the absorbent structure and partially directed from the<br>
protrusions into the recesses 84. This allows fluid, even relatively viscous fluid and fluid<br>
with high solids content to penetrate the sanitary napkin 20 and be rapidly directed away<br>
from the wearer.<br>
The methods for measuring the height H and equivalent width W will now be<br>
described with reference to Figures 4 to 5B.<br>
Height<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the height H corresponds to the vertical distance between the<br>
imaginary reference plane R and the most elevated portion, or apex A, of a given protrusion.<br>
The height H of the protrusions extends by at least 0.5 mm above the reference plane R. It is<br>
therefore implicitly understood that protrusions having a height H that extends above 0.5mm<br>
remain within the spirit of the invention. For example, the protrusions could have a height H<br>
that extends up tn 2.0mm above the reference plane R. Moreover, the protrusions 72, 74,<br>
76, and 78 also have a ratio W/H ranging between about 2 and about 10. However, the ratio<br>
W/H could more restrictively range between 3 to 9, between 4 to 8, or between 5 to 7.<br><br>
The imaginary reference plane R is established by the following procedure. Firstly, a<br>
point of origin P is identified on the given protrusion. A point of origin P is a point of inflection<br>
at which a sidewall 71 of the protrusion joins the layer containing the protrusion (e.g., the<br>
cover layer 56). An isolated protrusion is likely to have an infinite number of points of origin<br>
P that form a continuous line circumscribing the protrusion.<br>
The imaginary reference plane R contains the point of origin P, as defined earlier.<br>
The plane R must intersect the sidewalls 71 of the protrusion, thereby defining a connected<br>
bi-dimensional space. The bi-dimensional space can be a simply connected space (as<br>
shown in Figure 9A). or a multiply connected space (as shown in Figure 9B). A space is<br>
simply connected if every loop made within that space is contractible to a single point. In<br>
other words, a simply connected space has no "holes". If all the points of origin P are at the<br>
same vertical elevation, the imaginary reference plane R will intersect the protrusion's side<br>
walls at all of its points of origin. In such a case, the points of origin will collectively define<br>
the boundary of the protrusion. Protrusions may exist in which the reference plane will not<br>
intersect all of the points of origin P. This occurs when at least some of the points of origin<br>
are at a different vertical elevation than others. Any reference plane including a point of<br>
origin P, that intersects the protrusion to \onm either a simply connected space or a multiply<br>
connected space will define a boundary of the protrusion. It should be noted that a number<br>
of different imaginary reference planes could be defined for a given protrusion depending on<br>
the choice of the point of origin.<br>
It should also be expressly understood that each protrusion may have more than one<br>
apex. For example, if the protrusion is in the form of a level raised area (as in Figure 5),<br>
then there would be a plurality of apexes which would define a plateau. Moreover, if the<br>
protrusion is in the form of a series of steps, then there would be a plurality of apexes<br>
defining the most elevated step or plateau. If, however, the protrusion is in the form of a<br>
single triangle, then there would be a single apex.<br>
PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF PROTRUSIONS<br>
Once the imaginary reference plane R is established and the apex A is identified for<br>
a given protrusion, then the height H and width W can be measured. These measurements<br>
can be done by using any appropriate method such as, for example, using a microscope<br>
capable of determining focal distances. Examples of such microscopes are commercialized<br><br>
by Edmund Scientific, among others.<br>
An alternative would be to use a more refined automated method. For accurate<br>
measurements of the height and width of the protrusions 72, 74, 76, and 78 it is preferred<br>
that an optical measurement system be employed. For example, one particular method that<br>
is capable of accurately determining the height and width of the protrusions 72, 74, 76, and<br>
78 involves the use of a digital stripe protrusion technique, which can be performed using a<br>
system such as the PRIMOS optical 3D skin measurement system, commercially available<br>
from GFMesstechnik GmbH of Berlin, Germany. Although the PRIMOS optical 3D skin<br>
measurement system is generally used for taking in vivo skin measurements, it can also be<br>
used to take 3D surface measurements of inanimate objects, such as sanitary napkins.<br>
Shown in Figure 8, is a schematic representation of an optical 3D measurement<br>
system 110 that is suitable for obtaining 3D surface measurements of the fluid management<br>
article, such as the sanitary napkin 20 of the present invention. The optical 3D measurement<br>
system 110 includes an optical measurement head 112 having a light projector 114, a CCD<br>
recording camera 116 and a protrusion and shooting optic (not shown). The light projector<br>
114 may be a digital micromirror projector such as a Djgital Micromirror Device (DMD) that is<br>
available from Texas Instruments of Houston; Texas. In operation, the light projector 116<br>
projects a series of alternating black and white parallel stripe patterns onto the surface of the<br>
sanitary napkin, wherein each stripe pattern has stripes of different widths. The minute<br>
elevation differences on the surface of the sanitary napkin 20 distort the parallel stripes, and<br>
it is these distortions that constitute a qualitative and quantitative representation of the<br>
surface profile of the sanitary napkin 20.<br>
The CCD recording camera 116 acquires the pictures of the distorted stripe patterns<br>
and forwards them to a processing unit 118, such as a personal computer, that is connected<br>
to the optical measurement head 112. The processing unit 118 is operative to drive the light<br>
projector 114 and receive signals from the CCD recording camera 116. The pictures<br>
acquired by the CCD recording camera 116 and received by the processing unit 118 are<br>
analyzed by the processing unit 118 in order to derive surface measurements of the sanitary<br>
napkins being measured. The processing unit 118 may employ PRIMUS SOFT software,<br>
also commercially available from GFMesstechnik of Berlin, Germany, in order to interpret the<br>
data from the CCD recording camera 116.<br><br>
One suitable process for obtaining height measurements using the PRIMOS optical<br>
3D measurement system 110, is as follows. Firstly, the optical 3D measurement system<br>
110, including the light projector 114, a CCD recording camera 116, and the processing unit<br>
118 are powered and allowed to warm up. Once warmed up, the "technical surface" setting<br>
is selected, which is the appropriate setting for obtaining surface measurements of<br>
inanimate objects. The next step is to perform a calibration procedure. For example, in order<br>
to calibrate the PRIMOS optical 3D measurement system 110, a calibration block having a<br>
trench of a certain vertical depth is placed under the optical measurement head 112 and the<br>
focus and light intensity of the equipment are adjusted. In order to adjust the light intensity, a<br>
light adjustment knob located on the camera is manually adjusted until a visual indicator in<br>
the form of a circle that changes color, turns green. The green circle indicates that the light<br>
intensity is properly set. The focus is adjusted by adjusting a red-screen cross hair such that<br>
it is in alignment with a black cross hair.<br>
Once the light intensity and focus have been set, the user hits the "measure" button.<br>
The "measure" button causes the PRIMUS SOFT program to generate an index color image<br>
of the reference block's surface, which is shown to a user on a display screen. The index<br>
color image shows the object's surface in different colors depending on the surface's<br>
different vertical heights. A profile line is drawn perpendicular to the reference block's trench<br>
on the display screen using a mouse or other suitabte user interface. The PRIMUS SOFT<br>
software then generates a two dimensional graph of the reference block's surface profile<br>
along that profile line. In order to determine the height of the trench, the mouse is then<br>
clicked on the two dimensional graph at a location that represents the top surface of the<br>
reference block. The mouse is then clicked a second time on the two dimensional graph at a<br>
location that appears to be the bottom of the trench. The user then selects a vertical distance<br>
function from a tool bar or from a drop down menu. The vertical distance function provides<br>
the vertical distance between the two locations on the profile where the mouse was clicked.<br>
That vertical distance is then compared to the reference distance indicated on the reference<br>
block. If the measured distance is within 1% of the distance indicated on the reference block,<br>
then the PRIMUS optical 3D measurement system 110 is calibrated.<br>
Once calibrated, the reference block is removed, and the sanitary napkin 20 is<br>
placed under the optical measurement head 112. The light intensity and focus are adjusted<br>
once more and the "measure" button is selected. The PRIMUS SOFT program generates an<br>
index color image of the sample being measured. A profile line is then drawn on the index<br><br>
color image perpendicular to the region where the height measurement is going to be taken.<br>
A two dimensional graph of the sample's surface profile along that profile line is then<br>
generated. Once generated, the mouse is clicked on the two dimensional profile at a location<br>
that most closely approximates an imaginary reference plane R. The mouse is then clicked a<br>
second time at a location on the two dimensional graph that most closely approximates the<br>
apex A of a protrusion. The user then selects the vertical distance function, which provides<br>
the vertical distance between the two locations on the profile where the mouse was clicked,<br>
which in the case of the present invention would be the height of the protrusion.<br>
In order to determine the width of a protrusion, the profile line is drawn across the<br>
width of the protrusion. A 2D profile of the sample's surface along that profile line is<br>
generated. The mouse is then clicked at the beginning and end of the section of the surface<br>
whose width is desired, and then the user selects a horizontal distance function from a<br>
toolbar or drop down menu. The horizontal distance function provides the distance between<br>
the two locations selected by the mouse, which in the case of the present invention could be<br>
the width of the protrusion.<br>
To facilitate obtaining accurate measurements of the height and width, the optical<br>
measurement head 112 may use, for example, a 32mm x 32mm field of view, with an x-y<br>
spatial resolution of 32 microns and a z-step resolution of 1 micron in order to obtain surface<br>
measurements of the sanitary napkin of the present invention. In addition, the point cloud<br>
from each acquisition may, for example, have 1,048,576 points (1024 x 1024).<br>
It should be understood that a protrusion is considered to fall within the scope of the<br>
present invention as long as any one of the reference planes defines a protrusion with at<br>
least one apex, such that the protrusion satisfies the height H and equivalent W<br>
requirements, W being measured as defined below.<br>
Width<br>
The equivalent width W of the protrusion is determined in the following<br>
manner. Firstly, a projected area of the closed 2-D figure, which was delimited during the<br>
calculation of the height of the protrusion, is computed. Then, the longest dimension L of<br>
the closed 2-D figure must be determined. Figure 6A shows an example of how the<br>
longest dimension L is determined for a conventional shape while Figure 6B shows an<br>
example of how the longest dimension L is determined for a complex shape. Finally, the<br><br>
squivalent width W of an imaginary figure (i.e., rectangle) having a surface area which is<br>
squivalent to the closed 2-D figure, and having a length L corresponding to the longest<br>
dimension L determined previously is computed.<br>
One non-limiting method of computing the projected area of a complex shape, is<br>
using a planimetry method. In order to use a planimetry method in combination with the<br>
PRIMUS optical 3D measurement system 110 as described above, a reference block<br>
having a shape of known area is placed under the optical measurement head 112 and<br>
measured such that the PRIMUS SOFT program generates an index color image of that<br>
shape. A screen capture of the index color image is taken and is imported into a program<br>
such as PHOTOSHOP, which has an edge detection feature. Using the edge detection<br>
feature, the edges of the shape of known area are detected and the number of pixels<br>
contained within the boundaries of those detected edges is calculated. The known area is<br>
then divided by the number of pixels contained within the boundaries of that complex<br>
shape in order to determine the area covered by each pixel. Once this is complete, the<br>
reference block is removed and the sample containing the complex shape is placed under<br>
the optical measurement head 112 of the PRIMUS optical 3D measurement system 10<br>
such that the PRIMUS SOFT program can generate an index color image of the complex<br>
shape. A screen capture of that index color image is taken and is imported into<br>
PHOTOSHOP in the same way as the screen capture of the reference block, as<br>
described above. The edge detection feature is then used to detect the edges of the<br>
complex shape, and the number of pixels contained within the boundaries of those<br>
detected edges is calculated. The number of pixels contained within the boundaries of the<br>
complex shape is then multiplied by the area covered by each pixel, as determined from<br>
the measurement of the shape on the reference block. This will provide a measurement<br>
of the projected area of the complex shape.<br>
Method of Manufacture<br>
Sanitary napkins having protrusions can be manufactured using different<br>
methods. Figures 7a and 7b, for example, schematically depict one such method. More<br>
specifically, the figures show that a web of starting material 100, which will later form part<br>
of sanitary napkin 20, is fed through a nip 102 defined by a pair of patterned rolls 104,<br>
106. As opposed to traditional embossing rolls, patterned rolls 104, 106 each<br>
respectively include teeth along their outer circumferences, which are adapted to<br><br>
intermesh with one another in a male-female relationship. Patterned rolls 104, 106<br>
thereby form a profiled component 108 (i.e., with protrusions) from the web of starting<br>
material 100. This profiled component 108 can then be used in a subsequent step (not<br>
shown) to form sanitary napkin 20.<br>
Figures 7a and 7b show a simplified version of patterned rolls 104, 106. It is to be<br>
noted that the patterned rolls 104, 106 can have intermeshing male-female teeth defining<br>
any type of protrusion pattern.<br>
Moreover, Figures 7a and 7b also show the web of starting material 100 as a<br>
simplified single-layer structure. In reality, the web of starting material 100 can also have<br>
a multi-layer structure including at least one or more of the layers (described above)<br>
which form sanitary napkin 20. Preferably, the web of starting material 100 has a multi-<br>
layer structure including the fluid-permeable cover layer 56 and one or more layers of the<br>
absorbent system 60. For example, the web of starting material 100 can include the ffuid-<br>
permeable cover layer 56 and the transfer layer 62, both of which are simultaneously<br>
treated to form profiled component 108 that forms the upper treated component 75 that is<br>
later combined with the remaining components of the sanitary napkin 20. The web of<br>
starting material 100 includes material that has the ability to retain a shape imparted to it<br>
by the patterned rollers 104 and 106.<br>
It should also be noted that although Figures 7a and 7b show a continuous<br>
method, other methods which are intermittent or discontinuous in nature remain within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The absorbent articles of the present invention are advantageous in that the<br>
projections are characterized by a height and width that creates a desirable visual<br>
perception of thickness in an article that is relatively thin. Although various embodiments<br>
have been illustrated, this was for the purpose of describing, but not limiting, the<br>
