Component Comprising a Derived Timber Product, Mounting<br>
Stuck Thereon, and Method for Producing Said Component<br>
The invention relates to a component consisting of a<br>
derived timber product and a mounting stuck thereon.<br>
Likewise, the invention relates to a method for sticking a<br>
mounting on a derived timber product.<br>
In line with the description of the invention, the term<br>
derived timber product is understood to mean that the<br>
element consists of natural wood and of individual elements<br>
of natural wood, respectively, or of a material<br>
manufactured from wood. Elements, which are manufactured<br>
from individual elements consisting of wood, can be core<br>
boards, for example. Materials, which are manufactured from<br>
wood, can be medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density<br>
fiberboards (HDF), hardboards, chipboards or oriented<br>
strand boards (OSB) as well.<br>
It is known from the state of the art to provide<br>
components, which encompass derived timber products, with<br>
metal mountings, such as handle bars or hinges. This is<br>
particularly known with pieces of furniture or doors as<br>
well. As a general rule, mechanical fixing means are used<br>
for this purpose. In particular, the mountings are fixed to<br>
the surface of the derived timber product by means of<br>
screws.<br>
However, there are also components, which do not consist of<br>
a massive layer of a derived timber product, but which only<br>
encompass a derived timber product layer comprising a small<br>
thickness, which complicate the screwing process or which<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
render it impossible. In these cases, the mountings must be<br>
fixed in a different manner, in particular adhesively<br>
bonded with the component.<br>
However, an adhesive bonding represents an extensive method<br>
step, in particular the application and hardening of the<br>
adhesive as well as the positioning of the mounting<br>
relative to the derived timber product represent extensive<br>
method steps. In particular, due to the heat energy<br>
required for the processing, the application of adhesives,<br>
which can be activated by means of heat energy, represents<br>
a problem, because each derived timber product changes its<br>
color, chars or is otherwise changed in response to being<br>
heated too much.<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical problem of<br>
improving a method and a component of the afore-mentioned<br>
type so that the bonding with an adhesive, which is to be<br>
thermally activated, is simplified and, at the same time,<br>
the quality of the adhesive connection can be improved.<br>
The afore-presented technical problem is solved by means of<br>
a method for adhesively bonding a mounting with a derived<br>
timber product according to claim 1, where the contact area<br>
of the mounting is at least partially provided with an<br>
adhesive, where the contact area of the mounting is brought<br>
into contact with the derived timber product, where heat<br>
energy is created in the mounting or in the adhesive prior<br>
to or after being brought into contact by means of magnetic<br>
induction, where the adhesive is heated and activated by<br>
means of the heat energy, and where an adhesive connection<br>
is created between the mounting and the derived timber<br>
product by means of the hardening adhesive.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
In particular, the method is advantageous in that the<br>
mounting is provided with the adhesive in a first step, if<br>
applicable also chronologically long before being<br>
adhesively bonded with the derived timber product. In a<br>
cooled-down state and without additional heating, the<br>
adhesive does not have any or only a slight adhesive<br>
effect. The adhesive is to develop the adhesive force only<br>
when the contact area comprising the adhesive is brought or<br>
has been brought into contact with the surface of the<br>
derived timber product.<br>
This thus results in the advantage of the method, in<br>
particular in industrial use, because the mountings can be<br>
provided with the adhesive by the manufacturer, so that the<br>
mountings must then only be heated locally in response to<br>
being processed with the derived timber product.In this<br>
respect it is particularly advantageous that only the<br>
mounting or only the adhesive itself is heated by means of<br>
the induction and that a heating of the derived timber<br>
product occurs only to a limited extent.<br>
For this purpose, the mounting or the adhesive is heated by<br>
means of a magnetic induction source, either prior to or<br>
after being brought into contact. The advantage of the<br>
magnetic induction lies in that only the electrically<br>
conductive portion of the mounting or of the adhesive<br>
itself heats up, without having to create a thermal<br>
radiation. Only the mounting or the adhesive and not the<br>
derived timber product are thus heated in the first step by<br>
means of the magnetic induction. The adhesive is thus<br>
activated and unfolds its adhesive force.<br>
Heat is transferred to the derived timber product via the<br>
contact with the adhesive and, to a small extent, also by<br>
means of thermal radiation, originating from the mounting<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
or originating from the adhesive. However, temperature<br>
limits are not exceeded thereby so that a discoloration,<br>
burning or charring of the derived timber product can<br>
occur. The cool-down of the adhesive, in turn, occurs after<br>
the brief heating so rapidly that the entire heat<br>
transferred to the derived timber product has no negative<br>
effects on the derived timber product.<br>
The inductive heating of an electrically conductive body by<br>
means of magnetic induction can be carried out by means of<br>
a device, which, by means of a coil being fed with an<br>
alternating current, creates an alternating magnetic field,<br>
which induces an alternating current in an electrically<br>
conductive element. Due to the electric resistance, this<br>
current induced, in the element causes a heating of the<br>
element at the locations of the current flow. The heat<br>
created in such a manner develops immediately and directly<br>
in the element itself and in is interior, respectively,<br>
that is, it must not be guided to that location by means of<br>
thermal conduction.<br>
Non-conductive materials, that is, in particular derived<br>
timber products of the afore-mentioned type, are not heated<br>
by means of induction. Furthermore, materials having a good<br>
conductivity, such as aluminum or copper, can barely be<br>
heated due the low electric resistance. Metals, which are<br>
suitable for an induction heating thus have a high electric<br>
resistance.<br>
A device which is suitable for carrying out the method, is<br>
disclosed in DE 203 00 624 Ul. This is a hand-held unit,<br>
with which inductive heating can be carried out. It goes<br>
without saying that the invention is not limited to the use<br>
of hand-held units. In the industrial application, for<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
example in the industrial manufacture of furniture,<br>
stationary devices can be used as well.<br>
In a particularly preferred manner, the mounting consists<br>
of a material which can be heated by means of a magnetic<br>
induction, and is heated by means of the magnetic<br>
induction. The heat, which develops in the mounting, is<br>
then transferred to the adhesive. Preferably, the mounting<br>
consists of a metal, but an electrically conductive plastic<br>
material or a plastic material containing electrically<br>
conductive particles can be used as well.<br>
Likewise, it is possible that the adhesive is electrically<br>
conductive and is heated by means of magnetic induction. In<br>
this case, the heat energy is created directly in the<br>
adhesive itself, that is, precisely at the location where<br>
the heat energy is required for the activation and the<br>
hardening of the adhesive.<br>
It is furthermore possible that the inherently electrically<br>
non-conductive adhesive includes electrically conductive<br>
particles, which are heated by means of magnetic induction.<br>
For example, the adhesive can contain metal particles or<br>
metal chips, which are heated by means of magnetic<br>
induction and which then emit the heat energy to the<br>
adhesive. In this case, the heat thus develops precisely at<br>
the location, where it is required for the activation and<br>
the hardening of the adhesive.<br>
There are different possibilities for the design of the<br>
adhesive. The demands on the adhesive lie in that the<br>
adhesive is transferred into an active state by the supply<br>
of heat energy, so as to subsequently, after the cool-down,<br>
transition into the adhesive state and thus into the state,<br>
which connects the mounting and the derived timber product.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Preferably, the adhesive consists of a reaction adhesi ve<br>
and is at least partially pre-cross-linked prior to the<br>
installation of the mounting on the derived timber product.<br>
After the heating, the adhesive is then finally hardened.<br>
Reaction adhesives are classified into polymerization<br>
adhesives, polyaddition adhesives and polycondensation<br>
adhesives. The reaction adhesives are thus differentiated<br>
according to the types of the chemical reaction.<br>
All of them have in common that among them there are<br>
reaction adhesives which do not react at all or which react<br>
only to a certain extent at room temperature and which are<br>
heated only after the supply of heat energy to the extent<br>
that the chemical reaction occurs. These reaction adhesives<br>
are also referred to as warm-hardening or hot-hardening<br>
adhesives. Reaction adhesives which only require a<br>
relatively small temperature increase for stimulating the<br>
chemical reaction, are thereby preferred. Warm-hardening<br>
reaction adhesives are thus particularly preferred.<br>
In a further embodiment of the method, the adhesive<br>
consists of a thermoplastic adhesive and is at least<br>
partially hardened prior to the installation of the<br>
mounting on the derived timber product. The adhesive is<br>
then at least partially activated, in particular liquefied,<br>
by means of the heating so that a solid connection with the<br>
surface of the derived timber product is created and the<br>
adhesive effect occurs after the cool-down of the adhesive.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the method, an<br>
adhesive consisting of a combined adhesive system is used.<br>
One portion of the adhesive system consists of a<br>
thermoplastic adhesive and the other portion consists of a<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
reactive adhesive. Such adhesive systems are also known as<br>
reactive hot melt (RHM) adhesives.<br>
Furthermore, prior to the installation of the mounting, the<br>
surface of the derived timber product can be pretreated by<br>
means of roughening, grinding, smoothing and/or another<br>
method and/or a primer or other products can be applied for<br>
pretreatment of the surface.<br>
In particular, possible coatings of the derived timber<br>
product in the region which is to be adhesively bonded can<br>
be pretreated as mentioned above and/or partially or<br>
completely removed.<br>
The afore-described technical problem is solved by means of<br>
a component comprising the features of claim 7 as well.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the component are<br>
described in the dependent claims.<br>
The component as claimed in the invention encompasses at<br>
least one derived timber product and at least one mounting<br>
connected with the derived timber product. An adhesive<br>
layer is provided between the derived timber product and<br>
the mounting, wherein the adhesive connects the mounting<br>
with the derived timber product. According to the<br>
invention, the mounting or the adhesive layer is at least<br>
partially electrically conductive.<br>
A mounting is thereby understood to be every element, which<br>
can be connected with the derived timber product. For<br>
example, the mounting can be a hinge, a handle bar, a<br>
catch, an eyelet, a lock, an end piece, preferably a table<br>
leg or an accessory, which does not have a certain<br>
technical function.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Preferably, the mounting consists at least partially of an<br>
electrically conductive material. The mounting itself can<br>
thus be heated by means of the magnetic induction. Metals<br>
are preferable as electrically conductive materials.<br>
Likewise, however, plastic materials, which are either<br>
electrically conductive themselves or which encompass a<br>
plurality of electrically conductive particles, can be used<br>
as well.<br>
Furthermore, the adhesive layer can at least partially<br>
consist of an electrically conductive material. On the one<br>
hand, the conductivity of the adhesive layer can be created<br>
by an electrically conductive adhesive. On the other hand,<br>
the conductivity of the adhesive layer can be created by a<br>
plurality of electrically conductive particles within the<br>
adhesive.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner, the invention can be<br>
used for components, which are designed as lightweight<br>
building board with or without a frame construction,<br>
wherein the derived timber product encompasses at least an<br>
outer cover plate. In such a set-up, the component is not<br>
designed to be massive enough for a reliable connection of<br>
the mounting with the derived timber product to be<br>
established by means of mechanical means, such as screws.<br>
This is so because the component does not include<br>
sufficient solid material for the screws to be able to<br>
provide a fixed connection. Furthermore, it is preferred<br>
for the derived timber product to encompass an untreated<br>
surface. A good and reliable adhesive bonding with the<br>
surface can thus be ensured.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the surface of<br>
the derived timber product encompasses a coating, in<br>
particular a lacquer layer, a laminate layer, a melamine<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
resin layer, a veneer layer, preferably oiled or waxed, or<br>
a film coating. In this case, the mounting is adhesively<br>
bonded with the coating. An important condition for a<br>
permanent fixing of the mounting is then that the coating<br>
encompasses a sufficient adhesive power so as to be able to<br>
transfer the forces or stresses, which are to be<br>
transferred, to the derived timber product.<br>
As an alternative, prior to the installation of the<br>
mounting, the above-mentioned coatings can also be<br>
pretreated by means of roughening, grinding, smoothing<br>
and/or another method and/or a primer or other products can<br>
be applied for pretreatment. In particular, the coatings<br>
can be partially or completely removed in the region which<br>
is to be adhesively bonded.<br>
It goes without saying that all of the afore-mentioned<br>
pretreatments can also be carried out individually or in<br>
combination at the derived timber product itself.<br>
The afore-described component and a typical procedure will<br>
be described in more detail below by means of an exemplary<br>
embodiment as well as a further exemplary embodiment,<br>
wherein reference is made to the attached drawing. In the<br>
drawing<br>
Fig. 1 shows a derived timber product in lightweight<br>
construction comprising a mounting spaced apart<br>
therefrom,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the derived timber product in contact with<br>
the mounting, wherein electromagnetic radiation<br>
acts on the mounting for the purpose of inductive<br>
heating,<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
Fig. 3 shows the derived timber product comprising the<br>
mounting stuck thereon, wherein the mounting is<br>
screwed together with a further element and<br>
Fig. 4 shows an alternative embodiment of a derived timber<br>
product comprising the mounting stuck thereon,<br>
wherein the mounting is adhesively bonded with a<br>
further element as claimed in the invention as<br>
well.<br>
Different stages of the procedure for producing a component<br>
as claimed in the invention are explained in more detail in<br>
Figs. 1 to 3 by means of a preferred exemplary embodiment.<br>
Component 2 encompasses a derived timber product 4, which,<br>
in the instant case, is designed as a lightweight<br>
component. For this purpose, provision is made for a core<br>
layer 6, which is covered on both sides with a derived<br>
timber board 8 and 10. The core layer thereby consists of a<br>
honeycomb-shaped structure made of cardboard or aluminum,<br>
for example. The derived timber boards 8 and 10 are thereby<br>
so thin that a mounting 12, which in the instant case is<br>
designed as a hinge, cannot be screwed to a derived timber<br>
board 8 and 10.<br>
The mounting 12 is thus adhesively bonded with the surface<br>
of the upper derived timber product 8, wherein a magnetic<br>
induction as claimed in the invention is used for heating<br>
the mounting 12 during the adhesive bonding. For this<br>
purpose, the mounting 12 consists of an electrically<br>
conductive material, for example a metal.<br>
As is illustrated in Fig. 1, the derived timber product 4<br>
and the mounting 12 are initially arranged so as to be<br>
spaced apart from one another. A layer 16 consisting of an<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
adhesive, which is inherently stable and which has only a<br>
small or no adhesive effect, is arranged on the contact<br>
area 14 of the mounting 12, which is oriented downwards.<br>
As is indicated with the arrow in Fig. 1, the mounting 12<br>
is brought into contact with the surface of the derived<br>
timber product 4.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2, the mounting 12 is subsequently<br>
exposed to electromagnetic radiation, which leads to an<br>
inductive heating of the mounting 12, at least in the<br>
region of the contact area 14. This locally developing heat<br>
activates the adhesive, so that it can again unfold its<br>
adhesive force. The electromagnetic radiation is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2 by means of wavy lines and by means<br>
of a wide arrowhead.<br>
A device for creating the electromagnetic radiation is not<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2, because the instant invention does<br>
not rely to the type of device. Hand-held units or<br>
stationary devices can be used. In other words, the method<br>
according to the invention can be applied in industrial and<br>
automated scale as well as in an individual production.<br>
Fig. 3 then shows the component in its finally hardened<br>
condition, in which the derived timber product 4 is fixedly<br>
adhesively bonded with the mounting 12. Furthermore, Fig. 3<br>
shows that, at a different location, the mounting 12 is<br>
connected via a common screw connection with another<br>
element 18 by means of a screw 20.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an alternative exemplary embodiment of the<br>
derived timber product 4 comprising an adhesively bonded<br>
mounting 12. The derived timber board 8 and the core layer<br>
6 are recessed in a region, which is adapted to the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
circumference of the mounting 12. The mounting 12 is<br>
adhesively bonded with the derived timber board 10 and 8 by<br>
means of layers 16. This process was carried out according<br>
to the afore-described method.<br>
The outer surface of the mounting 12 can be arranged in a<br>
plane of the outer surface of the derived timber board 8,<br>
in particular by means of adapting the thickness of the<br>
mounting 12.<br>
Furthermore, it goes without saying that it is possible to<br>
adhesively bond the second portion of the mounting 12 with<br>
a further element, for example a door 18, also by means of<br>
a layer 16. In turn, the afore-described method as claimed<br>
in the invention can thereby be used for the adhesive<br>
bonding.<br>
Beforehand, the method was illustrated in such a manner<br>
that the mounting 12 was initially brought into contact<br>
with the derived timber product 4 and that the mounting 12<br>
was only subsequently exposed to the electromagnetic<br>
radiation. This procedure has the advantage that the<br>
inductive heating of the mounting 12 and thus of the<br>
adhesive only occurs, when there is already a contact with<br>
the derived timber product 4. The positioning of the<br>
mounting 12 on the surface of the derived timber product 4<br>
is thus facilitated, because no or only a slight adhesive<br>
force is available and a one-time contact with the surface<br>
can be dissolved or a displacement of the mounting 12 on<br>
the surface of the derived timber product 4 remains<br>
possible.<br>
However, it is also possible to initially inductively heat<br>
the mounting 12, before it is brought into contact with the<br>
derived timber product 4. In this case, the adhesive comes<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
into contact with the surface of the derived timber product<br>
4 only when it has already been at least partially<br>
activated.<br><br>
